Charged (nano)particles confined in electrodynamic traps can evolve into strongly correlated
Coulomb systems, which are the subject of current investigation. Exciting physical phenomena
associated to Coulomb systems have been reported such as autowave generation, phase transitions,
system self-locking at the ends of the linear Paul trap, self-organization in layers, or pattern
formation and scaling. The dynamics of ordered structures consisting of highly nonideal similarly
charged nanoparticles, with coupling parameter of the order $\Gamma = 10^8$ is investigated. This
approach enables us to study the interaction of nanoparticle structures in presence and in absence
of the neutralizing plasma background, as well as to investigate various types of phenomena and
physical forces these structures experience. Applications of electrodynamic levitation for
mass spectrometry, including containment and study of single aerosols and nanoparticles are reviewed,
with an emphasis on state of the art experiments and techniques, as well as future trends. Late experimental
data suggest that inelastic scattering can be successfully applied to the detection of biological
particles such as pollen, bacteria, aerosols, traces of explosives or synthetic polymers. Brownian
dynamics is used to characterize charged particle evolution in time and thus identify regions of
stable trapping. An analytical model is used to explain the experimental results. Numerical simulations
take into account the stochastic forces of random collisions with neutral particles, the viscosity
of the gas medium, the regular forces produced by the a.c. trapping voltage, and the gravitational
force. We show that microparticle dynamics is characterized by a stochastic Langevin differential
equation. Laser plasma acceleration of charged particles is also discussed.
