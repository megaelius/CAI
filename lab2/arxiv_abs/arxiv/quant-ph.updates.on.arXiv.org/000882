The modern state of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) is discussed. PEP can be considered from
two viewpoints. On the one hand, it asserts that particles with half-integer spin (fermions) are
described by antisymmetric wave functions, and particles with integer spin (bosons) are described
by symmetric wave functions. This is the so-called spin-statistics connection (SSC). As we will
discuss, the physical reasons why SSC exists are still unknown. On the other hand, according to PEP,
the permutation symmetry of the total wave functions can be only of two types: symmetric or antisymmetric,
both belong to the one-dimensional representations of the permutation group, all other types of
permutation symmetry are forbidden. While the solution of the Schroedinger equation may have any
permutation symmetry. As follows from the analysis of possible scenarios, the permission of states
with permutation symmetry more general than symmetric and antisymmetric (degenerate permutation
states) leads to contradictions with the concepts of particle identity and their independence.
Thus the existence in our nature particles only in nondegenerate permutation states (symmetric
and antisymmetric) is not accidental, as was accepted before, and so-called symmetrization postulate
may not be considered as a postulate, since all symmetry options for the total wave function, except
the antisymmetric and symmetric, cannot be realized. From this an important conclusion follows:
we may not expect that in future some unknown elementary particles that are not fermions or bosons
can be discovered. In the last part of the paper, experimental verifications of PEP are discussed.
It is shown that if really a small part of electrons exists that does not obey PEP, these non-Pauli
electrons could not be detected in spectroscopic experiments, in which forbidden X-ray transitions
are measured.
