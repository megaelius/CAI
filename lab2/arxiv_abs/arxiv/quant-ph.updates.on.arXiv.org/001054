[Shortened Abstract:] This thesis explores the possibility that quantum probabilities arose
thermodynamically. A chief concern is the detection of primordial `quantum nonequilibrium',
since this is observably distinct from textbook quantum physics. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 are adaptations
of references [1,2,3], and [4] respectively. Chapter 2 proposes (information) entropy conservation
as a minimal requirement for a theory to feature classical-style thermodynamic relaxation. The
resulting structure is dubbed `the iRelax framework'. Both classical mechanics and de Broglie-Bohm
quantum theory are shown to be special cases. Indications for a possible extension or unification
of de Broglie-Bohm theory are briefly highlighted. Chapter 3 examines ways in which quantum relaxation
may be prevented. The method of the drift-field is introduced. A systematic treatment of nodes is
given. A category of quantum states is found for which relaxation is significantly impeded, and
may not complete at all. Chapters 4 and 5 consider the possibility that primordial quantum nonequilibrium
may be conserved in the statistics of a species of relic cosmological particle. Necessary factors
for this to be the case are discussed and illustrative scenarios are given both in terms of nonequilibrium
particles created by inflaton decay, as well as relic vacuum modes for species that decoupled close
to the Planck temperature. The search for so-called `smoking-gun' spectral lines created by dark
matter decay or annihilation is argued to be a particularly promising setting for the detection
of quantum nonequilibrium. Unintuitive spectral effects relating to the contextuality of quantum
measurements are described. If such a suspected source of quantum nonequilibrium were found, its
subjection to a specifically quantum mechanical test would confirm or deny the presence of the quantum
nonequilibrium conclusively.
