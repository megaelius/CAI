Unitary transformations are the fundamental building blocks of gates and operations in quantum
information processing allowing the complete manipulation of quantum systems while preserving
crucial physical properties such as energy, orthogonality and entanglement. In the case of photons,
optical elements that can perform unitary transformations are readily available only for some
degrees of freedom, e.g. wave plates for polarisation. However for high-dimensional states encoded
in the transverse spatial modes of light, performing arbitrary unitary transformations remains
a challenging task for both theoretical proposals and actual implementations. Following the idea
of multi-plane light conversion, we show that it is possible to perform a broad variety of unitary
operations when the number of phase modulation planes is comparable to the number of modes. More
importantly, we experimentally implement several high-dimensional quantum gates for up to 5-dimensional
states encoded in the full-field mode structure of photons. In particular, we realise cyclic and
quantum Fourier transformations, known as Pauli $\hat{X}$-gates and Hadamard $\hat{H}$-gates,
respectively, with an average visibility of more than 90%. In addition, we demonstrate near-perfect
"unitarity" by means of quantum process tomography unveiling a process purity of 99%. Lastly, we
demonstrate the benefit of the two independent spatial degrees of freedom, i.e. azimuthal and radial,
and implement a two-qubit controlled-NOT quantum operation on a single photon. Thus, our demonstrations
open up new paths to implement high-dimensional quantum operations, which can be applied to various
tasks in quantum communication, computation and sensing schemes.
