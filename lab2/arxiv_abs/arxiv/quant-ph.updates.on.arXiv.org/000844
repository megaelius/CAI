The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), a variational algorithm to obtain an approximated
ground state of a given Hamiltonian, is an appealing application of near-term quantum computers.
The original work [A. Peruzzo et al.; \textit{Nat. Commun.}; \textbf{5}, 4213 (2014)] focused
only on finding a ground state, whereas the excited states can also induce interesting phenomena
in molecules and materials. Calculating excited states is, in general, a more difficult task than
finding ground states for classical computers. To extend the framework to excited states, we here
propose an algorithm, the subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE). This algorithm
searches a low energy subspace by supplying orthogonal input states to the variational ansatz and
relies on the unitarity of transformations to ensure the orthogonality of output states. The $k$-th
excited state is obtained as the highest energy state in the low energy subspace. The proposed algorithm
consists only of two parameter optimization procedures and does not employ any ancilla qubits.
The disuse of the ancilla qubits is a great improvement from the existing proposals for excited states,
which have utilized the swap test, making our proposal a truly near-term quantum algorithm. We further
generalize the SSVQE to obtain all excited states up to the $k$-th by only a single optimization procedure.
From numerical simulations, we verify the proposed algorithms. This work greatly extends the applicable
domain of the VQE to excited states and their related properties like a transition amplitude without
sacrificing any feasibility of it.
