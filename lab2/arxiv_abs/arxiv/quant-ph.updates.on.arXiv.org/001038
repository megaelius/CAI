Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown significance of quantum information scrambling
(i.e. a spread of quantum information over a system degrees of freedom) for problems encountered
in high-energy physics, quantum information, and condensed matter. Due to complexity of quantum
many-body systems it is plausible that new developments in this field will be achieved by experimental
explorations. Since noise effects are inevitably present in experimental implementations, a
better theoretical understanding of quantum information scrambling in systems affected by noise
is needed. To address this problem we study indicators of quantum scrambling -- out-of-time-ordered
correlation functions (OTOCs) in open quantum systems. As most experimental protocols for measuring
OTOCs are based on backward time evolution we consider two possible scenarios of joint system-environment
dynamics reversal: In the first one the evolution of the environment is reversed, whereas in the
second it is not. We derive general formulas for OTOCs in those cases as well as study in detail the
model of a spin chain coupled to the environment of harmonic oscillators. In the latter case we derive
expressions for open systems OTOCs in terms of Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Subsequently,
assuming that dephasing dominates over dissipation, we provide bounds on open system OTOCs and
illustrate them for a spectral density known from the spin-boson problem. In addition to being significant
for quantum information scrambling, our results also advance understating of decoherence in processes
involving backward time evolution.
