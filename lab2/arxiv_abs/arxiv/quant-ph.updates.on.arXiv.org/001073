Answering the question of existence of efficient quantum algorithms for NP-hard problems require
deep theoretical understanding of the properties of the low-energy eigenstates and long-time
coherent dynamics in quantum spin glasses. We discovered and described analytically the property
of asymptotic orthogonality resulting in a new type of structure in quantum spin glass. Its eigen-spectrum
is split into the alternating sequence of bands formed by quantum states of two distinct types ($x$
and $z$). Those of $z$-type are non-ergodic extended eigenstates (NEE) in the basis of $\{\sigma_z\}$
operators that inherit the structure of the classical spin glass with exponentially long decay
times of Edwards Anderson order parameter at any finite value of transverse field $B_{\perp}$.
Those of $x$-type form narrow bands of NEEs that conserve the integer-valued $x$-magnetization.
Quantum evolution within a given band of each type is described by a Hamiltonian that belongs to either
the ensemble of Preferred Basis Levi matrices ($z$-type) or Gaussian Orthogonal ensemble ($x$-type).
We characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics using fractal dimension $D$ that depends on energy
density (temperature) and plays a role of thermodynamic potential: $D=0$ in MBL phase, $0<D<1$
in NEE phase, $D\rightarrow 1$ in ergodic phase in infinite temperature limit. MBL states coexist
with NEEs in the same range of energies even at very large $B_{\perp}$. Bands of NEE states can be used
for new quantum search-like algorithms of population transfer in the low-energy part of spin-configuration
space. Remarkably, the intermitted structure of the eigenspectrum emerges in quantum version
of a statistically featureless Random Energy Model and is expected to exist in a class of paractically
important NP-hard problems that unlike REM can be implemented on a computer with polynomial resources.
