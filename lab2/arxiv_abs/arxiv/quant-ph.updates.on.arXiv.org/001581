Estimating the expectation value of an operator corresponding to an observable is a fundamental
task in quantum computation. It is often impossible to obtain such estimates directly, as the computer
is restricted to measuring in a fixed computational basis. One common solution splits the operator
into a weighted sum of Pauli operators and measures each separately, at the cost of many measurements.
An improved version collects mutually commuting Pauli operators together before measuring all
operators within a collection simultaneously. The effectiveness of doing this depends on two factors.
Firstly, we must understand the improvement offered by a given arrangement of Paulis in collections.
In our work, we propose two natural metrics for quantifying this, operating under the assumption
that measurements are distributed optimally among collections so as to minimise the overall finite
sampling error. Motivated by the mathematical form of these metrics, we introduce SORTED INSERTION,
a collecting strategy that exploits the weighting of each Pauli operator in the overall sum. Secondly,
to measure all Pauli operators with a collection simultaneously, a circuit is required to rotate
them to the computational basis. In our work, we present two efficient circuit constructions that
suitably rotate any collection of $k$ commuting $n$-qubit Pauli operators using at most $kn-k(k+1)/2$
and $O(kn/\log k)$ two-qubit gates respectively. Our methods are numerically illustrated in the
context of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, where the operators in question are molecular
Hamiltonians. As measured by our metrics, SORTED INSERTION outperforms four conventional greedy
colouring algorithms that seek the minimum number of collections.
