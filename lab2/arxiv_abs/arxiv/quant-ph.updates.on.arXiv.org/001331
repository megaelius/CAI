An often used model for quantum theory is to associate to every physical system a C*-algebra. From
a physical point of view it is unclear why operator algebras would form a good description of nature.
In this paper, we find a set of physically meaningful assumptions such that any physical theory satisfying
these assumptions must embed into the category of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. These assumptions
were originally introduced in the setting of effectus theory, a categorical logical framework
generalizing classical and quantum logic. As these assumptions have a physical interpretation,
this motivates the usage of operator algebras as a model for quantum theory. In contrast to other
reconstructions of quantum theory, we do not start with the framework of generalized probabilistic
theories and instead use effect theories where no convex structure and no tensor product needs to
be present. The lack of this structure in effectus theory has led to a different notion of pure maps.
A map in an effectus is pure when it is a composition of a compression and a filter. These maps satisfy
particular universal properties and respectively correspond to `forgetting' and `measuring'
the validity of an effect. We define a pure effect theory (PET) to be an effect theory where the pure
maps form a dagger-category and filters and compressions are adjoint. We show that any convex finite-dimensional
PET must embed into the category of Euclidean Jordan algebras. Moreover, if the PET also has monoidal
structure, then we show that it must embed into either the category of real or complex C*-algebras,
which completes our reconstruction.
