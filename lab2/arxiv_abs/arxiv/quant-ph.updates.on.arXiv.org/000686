We prove that $poly(t) \cdot n^{1/D}$-depth local random quantum circuits with two qudit nearest-neighbor
gates on a $D$-dimensional lattice with n qudits are approximate $t$-designs in various measures.
These include the "monomial" measure, meaning that the monomials of a random circuit from this family
have expectation close to the value that would result from the Haar measure. Previously, the best
bound was $poly(t)\cdot n$ due to Brandao-Harrow-Horodecki (BHH) for $D=1$. We also improve the
"scrambling" and "decoupling" bounds for spatially local random circuits due to Brown and Fawzi.
One consequence of our result is that assuming the polynomial hierarchy (PH) is infinite and that
certain counting problems are $\#P$-hard on average, sampling within total variation distance
from these circuits is hard for classical computers. Previously, exact sampling from the outputs
of even constant-depth quantum circuits was known to be hard for classical computers under the assumption
that PH is infinite. However, to show the hardness of approximate sampling using this strategy requires
that the quantum circuits have a property called "anti-concentration", meaning roughly that the
output has near-maximal entropy. Unitary 2-designs have the desired anti-concentration property.
Thus our result improves the required depth for this level of anti-concentration from linear depth
to a sub-linear value, depending on the geometry of the interactions. This is relevant to a recent
proposal by the Google Quantum AI group to perform such a sampling task with 49 qubits on a two-dimensional
lattice and confirms their conjecture that $O(\sqrt n)$ depth suffices for anti-concentration.
We also prove that anti-concentration is possible in depth O(log(n) loglog(n)) using a different
model.
