Fast and high-fidelity quantum state detection is essential for building robust spin-based quantum
information processing platforms in semiconductors. The Pauli spin blockade (PSB)-based spin-to-charge
conversion and its variants are widely used for the spin state discrimination of two-electron singlet-triplet
(ST$_0$) qubits; however, the single-shot measurement fidelity is limited by either the low signal
contrast, or the short lifetime of the triplet state at the PSB energy detuning, especially due to
strong mixing with singlet states at large magnetic field gradients. Ultimately, the limited single-shot
measurement fidelity leads to low visibility of quantum operations. Here, we demonstrate an alternative
method to achieve spin-to-charge conversion of ST$_0$ qubit states using energy selective tunneling
between doubly occupied quantum dots (QDs) and electron reservoirs. We demonstrate a single-shot
measurement fidelity of 90% and an S-T$_0$ oscillation visibility of 81% at a field gradient of 100
mT (~ 500 $MHz\cdot h \cdot(g^{*}\cdot \mu_B)^{-1}$); this allows single-shot readout with full
electron charge signal contrast and, at the same time, long and tunable measurement time with negligible
effect of relaxation even at strong magnetic field gradients. Using an rf-sensor positioned opposite
to the QD array, we apply this method to two ST$_0$ qubits and show high-visibility readout of two
individual single-qubit gate operations is possible with a single rf single-electron transistor
sensor. We expect our measurement scheme for two-electron spin states can be applied to various
hosting materials and provides a simplified and complementary route for multiple qubit state detection
with high accuracy in QD-based quantum computing platforms.
