We give a new algorithm for computing the robustness of magic - a measure of the utility of quantum
states as a computational resource. Our work is motivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant
quantum computation. In this model, all unitaries belong to the Clifford group. Non-Clifford operations
are effected by injecting non-stabiliser states, which are referred to as magic states in this context.
Their robustness of magic measures the complexity of simulating the circuit using a classical Monte
Carlo algorithm. It is closely related to the degree negativity that slows down Monte Carlo simulations
through the infamous sign problem. Surprisingly, the robustness of magic is submultiplicative.
This implies that the classical simulation overhead scales subexponentially with the number of
injected magic states - better than a naive analysis would suggest. However, determining the robustness
of n copies of a magic state is difficult, as its definition involves a convex optimisation problem
in a 4^n-dimensional space. In this paper, we make use of inherent symmetries to reduce the problem
to n dimensions. The total run-time of our algorithm, while still exponential in n, is super-polynomially
faster than previously published methods. We provide a computer implementation and give the robustness
of up to 10 copies of the most commonly used magic states. Guided by the exact results, we find an ansatz
for approximate solutions that can be evaluated in polynomial time and yield rigorous upper bounds
to the robustness. Technically, we use symmetries of the stabiliser polytope to connect the robustness
of magic to the geometry of a low-dimensional convex polytope generated by certain signed quantum
weight enumerators. As a by-product, we characterised the automorphism group of the stabiliser
polytope, and, more generally, of projections onto complex projective 3-designs.
