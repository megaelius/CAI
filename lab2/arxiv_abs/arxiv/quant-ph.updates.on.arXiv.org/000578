We develop a quantum version of the probability estimation framework [arXiv:1709.06159] for randomness
generation with quantum side information. We show that most of the properties of probability estimation
hold for quantum probability estimation (QPE). This includes asymptotic optimality at constant
error and randomness expansion with logarithmic input entropy. QPE is implemented by constructing
model-dependent quantum estimation factors (QEFs), which yield statistical confidence upper
bounds on data-conditional normalized R\'enyi powers. This leads to conditional min-entropy
estimates for randomness generation. The bounds are valid for relevant models of sequences of experimental
trials without requiring independent and identical or stationary behavior. QEFs may be adapted
to changing conditions during the sequence and trials can be stopped any time, such as when the results
so far are satisfactory. QEFs can be constructed from entropy estimators to improve the bounds for
conditional min-entropy of classical-quantum states from the entropy accumulation framework
[Dupuis, Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1607.01796]. QEFs are applicable to a larger class of models,
including models permitting measurement devices with super-quantum but non-signaling behaviors
and semi-device dependent models. The improved bounds are relevant for finite data or error bounds
of the form $e^{-\kappa s}$, where $s$ is the number of random bits produced. We give a general construction
of entropy estimators based on maximum probability estimators, which exist for many configurations.
For the class of $(k,2,2)$ Bell-test configurations we provide schemas for directly optimizing
QEFs to overcome the limitations of entropy-estimator-based constructions. We obtain and apply
QEFs for examples involving the $(2,2,2)$ Bell-test configuration to demonstrate substantial
improvements in finite-data efficiency.
