Validity conditions for the adiabatic approximation are useful tools to understand and predict
the quantum dynamics. Remarkably, the resonance phenomenon in oscillating quantum systems has
challenged the adiabatic theorem. In this scenario, inconsistencies in the application of quantitative
adiabatic conditions have led to a sequence of new approaches for adiabaticity. Here, by adopting
a different strategy, we introduce a validation mechanism for the adiabatic approximation by driving
the quantum system to a non-inertial reference frame. More specifically, we begin by considering
several relevant adiabatic approximation conditions previously derived and show that all of them
fail by introducing a suitable oscillating Hamiltonian for a single quantum bit (qubit). Then,
by evaluating the adiabatic condition in a rotated non-inertial frame, we show that all of these
conditions, including the standard adiabatic condition, can correctly describe the adiabatic
dynamics in the original frame, either far from resonance or at a resonant point. Moreover, we prove
that this validation mechanism can be extended for general multi-particle quantum systems, establishing
the conditions for the equivalence of the adiabatic behavior as described in inertial or non-inertial
frames. In order to experimentally investigate our method, we consider a hyperfine qubit through
a single trapped Ytterbium ion $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$, where the ion hyperfine energy levels are used
as degrees of freedom of a two-level system. By monitoring the quantum evolution, we explicitly
show the consistency of the adiabatic conditions in the non-inertial frame.
