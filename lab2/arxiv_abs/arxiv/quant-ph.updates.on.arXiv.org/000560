The brief works of Peierls on the role of the observer in quantum mechanics are examined, interpreted
and expanded to widen accessibility and understanding of these works. The approach followed here
is very much in the spirit adopted by Peierls who eschewed a `rigorous axiomatic' and aimed at using
`logic at the level of the working physicist'. The fundamental tenet of his work is that the wavefunction
or density matrix represents the knowledge of an observer and that two observers of the same system
may well have different knowledge and will use different density matrices to describe it. Essential
to the understanding of Peierls's approach is the demonstration given here that the density matrix
generally can be expressed entirely in terms of probabilities of observable outcomes and that such
probabilities are subjective in the first instance.The process by which the knowledge of two observers
may be combined is discussed in detail for some simple cases and, by using Bayes's theorem, the progress
to a common understanding of the correct density matrix for a given situation demonstrated. Peierls
gave a criterion to ensure that the amalgamation of data from two observers can never lead to violation
of the uncertainty principle : that the density matrices of two observers must commute. It is pointed
out that it is essential that the density matrices of two observers commute under all circumstances
no matter how inaccurate or even fanciful the data or beliefs used to construct them. Once this is
appreciated it can be shown that Peierls's density matrix commutation criterion is fully equivalent
to the standard result in quantum mechanics that two observables must commute if they are to be known
precisely and simultaneously,but now extended to imperfectly known mixed states rather than a
single eigenstate.
