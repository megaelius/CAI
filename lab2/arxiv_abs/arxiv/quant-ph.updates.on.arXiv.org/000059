Recently, it was suggested that there was some sort of breakdown of quantum field theory in the presence
of boundaries, manifesting itself as a torque anomaly. In particular, Fulling et al. used the finite
energy-momentum-stress tensor in the presence of a perfectly conducting wedge, calculated many
years ago by Deutsch and Candelas, to compute the torque on one of the wedge boundaries, where the
latter was cutoff by integrating the torque density down to minimum lower radius greater than zero.
They observed that that torque is not equal to the negative derivative of the energy obtained by integrating
the energy density down to the same minimum radius. This motivated a calculation of the torque and
energy in an annular sector obtained by the intersection of the wedge with two coaxial cylinders.
In a previous paper we showed that for the analogous scalar case, which also exhibited a torque anomaly
in the absence of the cylindrical boundaries, the point-split regulated torque and energy indeed
exhibit an anomaly, unless the point-splitting is along the axis direction. In any case, because
of curvature divergences, no unambiguous finite part can be extracted. However, that ambiguity
is linear in the wedge angle; if the condition is imposed that the linear term be removed, the resulting
torque and energy is finite, and exhibits no anomaly. In this paper, we demonstrate the same phenomenon
takes place for the electromagnetic field, so there is no torque anomaly present here either. This
is a nontrivial generalization, since the anomaly found by Fulling et al. is linear for the Dirichlet
scalar case, but nonlinear for the conducting electromagnetic case.
