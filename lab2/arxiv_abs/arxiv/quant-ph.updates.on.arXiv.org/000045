We give a first principles derivation of a master equation for the evolution of a quantum matter field
in a linearly perturbed Minkowski spacetime, based solely on quantum field theory and general relativity.
We make no additional assumptions nor introduce extra ingredients, as is often done in alternative
quantum theories. When the quantum matter field is projected to a one-particle state, the master
equation for a non-relativistic quantum particle in a weak gravitational field predicts decoherence
in the momentum basis, in contrast to most existing theories of gravitational decoherence. We point
out the gauge nature of time and space reparameterizations in matter-gravity couplings, and warn
that `intrinsic' decoherence or alternative quantum theories invoking stochastic dynamics arising
from temporal or spatial fluctuations violate this fundamental symmetry of classical general
relativity. Interestingly we find that the decoherence rate depends on extra parameters other
than the Planck scale, an important feature of gravitational decoherence. This is similar to the
dependence of the decoherence rate of a quantum Brownian particle to the temperature and spectral
density of the environment it interacts with. The corresponding features when gravity acts as an
environment in decohering quantum objects are what we call the `textures' of spacetime. We point
out the marked difference between the case when gravity is represented as a background spacetime
versus the case when gravity acts like a thermodynamic bath to quantum particles. This points to
the possibility of using gravitational decoherence measurements to discern whether gravity is
intrinsically elemental or emergent.
