Many deep, mysterious connections have been observed between collections of mutually unbiased
bases (MUBs) and combinatorial designs called $k$-nets (and in particular, between complete collections
of MUBs and finite affine - or equivalently: finite projective - planes). Here we introduce the notion
of a $k$-net over an algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and thus provide a common framework for both objects.
In the commutative case, we recover (classical) $k$-nets, while choosing $\mathfrak{A} := M_d(\mathbb
C)$ leads to collections of MUBs. A common framework allows one to find shared properties and proofs
that "inherently work" for both objects. As a first example, we derive a certain rigidity property
which was previously shown to hold for $k$-nets that can be completed to affine planes using a completely
different, combinatorial argument. For $k$-nets that cannot be completed and for MUBs, this result
is new, and, in particular, it implies that the only vectors unbiased to all but $k \leq \sqrt{d}$
bases of a complete collection of MUBs in $\mathbb C^d$ are the elements of the remaining $k$ bases
(up to phase factors). In general, this is false when $k$ is just the next integer after $\sqrt{d}$;
we present an example of this in every prime-square dimension, demonstrating that the derived bound
is tight. As an application of the rigidity result, we prove that if a large enough collection of MUBs
constructed from a certain type of group representation (e.g. a construction relying on discrete
Weyl operators or generalized Pauli matrices) can be extended to a complete system, then in fact
every basis of the completion must come from the same representation. In turn, we use this to show
that certain large systems of MUBs cannot be completed.
