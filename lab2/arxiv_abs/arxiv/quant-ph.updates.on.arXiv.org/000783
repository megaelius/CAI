We bound separations between the entangled and classical values for several classes of nonlocal
$t$-player games. Our motivating question is whether there is a family of $t$-player XOR games for
which the entangled bias is $1$ but for which the classical bias goes down to $0$, for fixed $t$. Answering
this question would have important consequences in the study of multi-party communication complexity,
as a positive answer would imply an unbounded separation between randomized communication complexity
with and without entanglement. Our contribution to answering the question is identifying several
general classes of games for which the classical bias can not go to zero when the entangled bias stays
above a constant threshold. This rules out the possibility of using these games to answer our motivating
question. A previously studied set of XOR games, known not to give a positive answer to the question,
are those for which there is a quantum strategy that attains value 1 using a so-called Schmidt state.
We generalize this class to mod-$m$ games and show that their classical value is always at least $\frac{1}{m}
+ \frac{m-1}{m} t^{1-t}$. Secondly, for free XOR games, in which the input distribution is of product
form, we show $\beta(G) \geq \beta^*(G)^{2^t}$ where $\beta(G)$ and $\beta^*(G)$ are the classical
and entangled biases of the game respectively. We also introduce so-called line games, an example
of which is a slight modification of the Magic Square game, and show that they can not give a positive
answer to the question either. Finally we look at two-player unique games and show that if the entangled
value is $1-\epsilon$ then the classical value is at least $1-\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon \log
k})$ where $k$ is the number of outputs in the game. Our proofs use semidefinite-programming techniques,
the Gowers inverse theorem and hypergraph norms.
