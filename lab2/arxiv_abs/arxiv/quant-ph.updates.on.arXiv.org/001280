Recently quantum simulators have been constructed to investigate experimentally the most prominent
theoretical four-point many-body system described by the Hubbard model. By varying the coupling
strength of the four-point interaction in relation to the kinetic term, one can analyze the phase
structure of the model. This intriguing fact leads us to investigate whether similar Hamiltonians
with four-point interactions can also be studied as a function of their four-point coupling strength.
In this paper, we reexamine the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, regarding it generally beyond the context
of quantum chromodynamics. Essentially, it is a model in which particle-antiparticle pairing
leads to a BCS-like condensate, with the result that chiral symmetry is broken dynamically in the
strong-coupling regime. To study the behavior of the system, it is necessary to move from this regime
to a hypothetical regime of weak coupling, altering the coupling strength of the interaction arbitrarily.
In order to do this, the gap equation must be regarded as complex and its Riemann surface structure
must be known. We do this and obtain a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the development
of a complex order parameter (the dynamically generated mass) from the second sheet of the Riemann
surface, as we move into the weak-coupling regime. The power-law behavior of the order parameter
in the vicinity of the phase transition point is demonstrated to be independent of the choice of the
regularization scheme with the critical exponent as $\beta \approx 0.55$. At the same time, the
isovector pseudoscalar modes retain their feature as Goldstone modes and still have zero mass,
while the isoscalar scalar meson follows the behavior of the order parameter and gains a width. Energetically,
this mode is not favored over the normal, uncondensed mode but would have to be accessed through an
excitation process.
