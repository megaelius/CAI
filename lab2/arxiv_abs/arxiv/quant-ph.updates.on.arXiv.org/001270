The characterization of transformations among entangled pure states via local operations assisted
by classical communication (LOCC) is a crucial problem in quantum information theory for both theoretical
and practical reasons. As LOCC has a highly intricate structure, sometimes the larger set of separable
(SEP) maps is considered, which has a mathematically much simpler description. In the literature,
mainly SEP maps consisting of invertible Kraus operators have been taken into account. In this paper
we show that the consideration of those maps is not sufficient when deciding whether a state can be
mapped to another via general SEP transformations. This is done by providing explicit examples
of transformations among pure 3- and 5- qubits states, which are feasible via SEP maps containing
singular Kraus operators, however, not possible via SEP maps containing solely regular Kraus operators.
The key point that allows to construct the SEP maps is to introduce projective measurements that
occur with probability zero on the input state. The fact that it is not sufficient to consider SEP
maps composed out of regular Kraus operators even in the case of pure state transformations, also
affects the results on LOCC transformations among pure states. However, we show that non-invertible
Kraus operators do not help in state transformations under LOCC with finitely many rounds of classical
communication, i.e. the necessary and sufficient condition for SEP transformations with invertible
Kraus operators is still a necessary condition for convertibility under finite-round LOCC. Moreover,
we show that the results on transformations via SEP that are not possible with LOCC (including infinitely
many rounds of classical communication) presented in M. Hebenstreit, C. Spee, and B. Kraus, Phys.
