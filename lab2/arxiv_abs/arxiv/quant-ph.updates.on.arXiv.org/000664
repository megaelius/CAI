Local measurements acting on entangled quantum states give rise to a rich correlation structure
in the multipartite scenario. We introduce a versatile technique to build families of Bell inequalities
witnessing different notions of multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties. The idea behind
our method is simple: a known Bell inequality satisfying certain constraints, for example the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality, serves as the $seed$ to build new families of inequalities for more parties. The constructed
inequalities have a clear operational meaning, capturing an essential feature of multipartite
correlations: their violation implies that numerous subgroups of parties violate the inequality
chosen as seed. The more multipartite nonlocal the correlations, the more subgroups can violate
the seed. We illustrate our construction using different seeds and designing Bell inequalities
to detect $m$-way nonlocal multipartite correlations, in particular, $genuine$ $multipartite$
$nonlocal$ correlations -- the strongest notion of multipartite nonlocality. For one of our inequalities
we prove analytically that a large class of pure states that are genuine multipartite entangled
exhibit genuine multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties, even for some states that are
almost product. We also provide numerical evidence that this family is violated by all genuine multipartite
entangled pure states of three and four qubits. Our results make us conjecture that this family of
Bell inequalities can be used to prove the equivalence between genuine multipartite pure-state
entanglement and nonlocality for any number of parties.
