We sketch a quantum mechanical framework for the universe as a whole. Within that framework we propose
a program for describing the ultimate origin in quantum cosmology of the quasiclassical domain
of familiar experience and for characterizing the process of measurement. Predictions in quantum
mechanics are made from probabilities for sets of alternative histories. Probabilities can be
assigned only to sets of histories that approximately decohere. Decoherence is defined and the
mechanism of decoherence is reviewed. Decoherence requires a sufficiently coarse-grained description
of alternative histories of the universe. A quasiclassical domain consists of a branching set of
alternative decohering histories, described by a coarse graining that is maximally refined consistent
with decoherence, with individual branches that exhibit a high level of classical correlation
in time. A quasiclassical domain is emergent in the universe as a consequence of the initial condition
and the action function of the elementary particles. It is an important question whether all the
quasiclassical domains are roughly equivalent or whether there are various essentially inequivalent
ones. A measurement is a correlation with variables in a quasiclassical domain. An observer (or
information gathering and utilizing system) is a complex adaptive system that has evolved to exploit
the relative predictability of a quasiclassical domain. We suggest that resolution of many of the
problems of interpretation presented by quantum mechanics is to be accomplished, not by further
scrutiny of the subject as it applies to reproducible laboratory situations, but rather by an examination
of alternative histories of the universe, stemming from its initial condition, and a study of the
problem of quasiclassical domains.
