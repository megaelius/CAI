A few decades ago, quantum optics stood out as a new domain of physics by exhibiting states of light
with no classical equivalent. The first investigations concerned single photons, squeezed states,
twin beams and EPR states, that involve only one or two modes of the electromagnetic field. The study
of the properties of quantum light then evolved in the direction of more and more complex and rich
situations, involving many modes, either spatial, temporal, frequency, or polarization modes.
Actually, each mode of the electromagnetic field can be considered as an individual quantum degree
of freedom. It is then possible, using the techniques of nonlinear optics, to couple different modes,
and thus to build in a controlled way a quantum network in which the nodes are optical modes and that
is endowed with a strong multipartite entanglement. In addition, such networks are easily reconfigurable
and subject only to weak decoherence. They open indeed many promising perspectives for optical
communications and computation. Because of the linearity of Maxwell equations a linear superposition
of two modes is another mode. This means that a "modal superposition principle" exists hand in hand
with the regular quantum state superposition principle. The purpose of the present review is to
show the interest of considering these two aspects of multimode quantum light in a global way. Indeed
using different sets of modes allows to consider the same quantum state under different perspectives:
a given state can be entangled in one basis, factorized in another. We will show how to produce, characterize
and tailor multimode quantum light. Finally we will describe some applications to quantum technologies,
such as parameter estimation and measurement-based quantum computation.
