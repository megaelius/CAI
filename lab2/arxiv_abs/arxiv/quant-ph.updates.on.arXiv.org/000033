In this work we suggest a simple (without any explicit use of the classical or quantum statistical
distributions and "without knowing the details of quantum gravity", we paraphrase Fursaev) theoretical
formalism for description of the basic thermodynamic characteristics in quantum gravity. We explicitly
consider only quantum of the thermal radiation with average energy (from whole energetic, statistically
distributed spectrum). We suppose that circumference (of the great circle) of the large system
or black hole horizon holds one reduced de Broglie wavelength of the average radiation quantum.
(It is in some way similar to the Bohr orbital momentum quantization postulate for the ground state
interpreted via de Broglie relation.) It is upposed that potential energy (absolute value) of the
gravitational interaction between large system and average radiation quantum is simply equivalent
to product of the Boltzmann constant and temperature. By this formalism we formally exactly reproduce
final form of the Unruh temperature for a massive spherical physical system and Hawking temperature,
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein entropy/surface quantization for a Schwarzschild black
hole. Also, we reproduce satisfactorily approximately Hawking evaporation law for the Schwarzschild
black hole. Finally, we apply our formalism on the consideration of the basic thermodynamic characteristics
(temperature and entropy) of the flat, vacuum (dark energy) dominated FRW universe. We demonstrate
that within tiny spherical shell (with surface equivalent to the universe "surface" and width equivalent
to the Planck length) mentioned FRW universe behaves practically as an ideal gas of the quantized
vacuum fluctuations (whose parameters, volume, pressure, temperature and number of the fluctuations,
do not depend explicitly of the cosmological constant).
