The outcomes of local measurements made on entangled systems can be certified to be random provided
that the generated statistics violate a Bell inequality. This way of producing randomness relies
only on a minimal set of assumptions because it is independent of the internal functioning of the
devices generating the random outcomes. In this context it is crucial to understand both qualitatively
and quantitatively how the three fundamental quantities -- entanglement, non-locality and randomness
-- relate to each other. To explore these relationships, we consider the case where repeated (non
projective) measurements are made on the physical systems, each measurement being made on the post-measurement
state of the previous measurement. In this work, we focus on the following questions: For systems
in a given entangled state, how many nonlocal correlations in a sequence can we obtain by measuring
them repeatedly? And from this generated sequence of non-local correlations, how many random numbers
is it possible to certify? In the standard scenario with a single measurement in the sequence, it
is possible to generate non-local correlations between two distant observers only and the amount
of random numbers is very limited. Here we show that we can overcome these limitations and obtain
any amount of certified random numbers from an entangled pair of qubit in a pure state by making sequences
of measurements on it. Moreover, the state can be arbitrarily weakly entangled. In addition, this
certification is achieved by near-maximal violation of a particular Bell inequality for each measurement
in the sequence. We also present numerical results giving insight on the resistance to imperfections
and on the importance of the strength of the measurements in our scheme.
