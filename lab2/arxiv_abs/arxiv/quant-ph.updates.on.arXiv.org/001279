We theoretically analyze superradiant emission of light from a cold atomic gas, when mechanical
effects of photon-atom interactions are considered. The atoms are confined within a standing-wave
resonator and an atomic metastable dipolar transition couples to a cavity mode. The atomic dipole
is incoherently pumped in the parameter regime that would correspond to stationary superradiance
in absence of inhomogeneous broadening. Starting from the master equation for cavity field and
atomic degrees of freedom we derive a mean-field model that allows us to determine a threshold temperature,
above which thermal fluctuations suppress superradiant emission. We then analyze the dynamics
of superradiant emission when the motion is described by a mean-field model. In the semiclassical
regime and below the threshold temperature we observe that the emitted light can be either coherent
or chaotic, depending on the incoherent pump rate. We then analyze superradiant emission from an
ideal Bose gas at zero temperature when the superradiant decay rate $\Lambda$ is of the order of the
recoil frequency $\omega_R$. We show that the quantized exchange of mechanical energy between
the atoms and the field gives rise to a threshold, $\Lambda_c$, below which superradiant emission
is damped down to zero. When $\Lambda>\Lambda_c$ superradiant emission is accompanied by the formation
of matter-wave gratings diffracting the emitted photons. The stability of these gratings depends
on the incoherent pump rate $w$ with respect to a second threshold value $w_c$. For $w>w_c$ the gratings
are stable and the system achieves stationary superradiance. Below this second threshold the coupled
dynamics becomes chaotic. We characterize the dynamics across these two thresholds and show that
the three phases we predict (incoherent, coherent, chaotic) can be revealed via the coherence properties
of the light at the cavity output.
