A topological concern is addressed in view of the extensively and intensively studied topological
phases of condensed matter. In this realm, the phases with topological order cannot be characterized
by symmetry alone. Moreover, the relevant phase transitions do occur without spontaneous symmetry
breaking, beyond the scope of Landau's theory. The first realization of such phases is the discovery
of the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE), which was followed soon by a topological interpretation.
Later on, a distinct, half-integer QHE was also found from graphene, which has almost spin degeneracy
described by $SU(2)$ symmetry. The previous theoretical predictions were realized in this finding.
It has been well understood that the anomaly of this half-integer QHE originates from the presence
of $2$D massless Dirac fermions around the zero energy with respect to the original Dirac points
(DPs). The very characteristic lies in that there exists a topologically robust zero-mode LL that
is a constant function of the perpendicular magnetic field. More deeply, this zero-mode LL is protected
by the local chiral symmetry (CS), against CS preserving perturbations provided that intervalley
scattering between the double DPs is inhibited, where the CS arises from the global sublattice symmetry
in spinless graphene. Since massless Dirac particles are broadly present in condensed matter with
various symmetries, not to mention Dirac bosonic systems, it is of interest to see how about the situations
in other systems with $2$D massless Dirac fermions. We address several notes in a topological viewpoint
on the presence of $2$D massless Dirac fermions in $3$D layered systems.In particular, we focus
on the zero-mode LL since this LL signifies $2$D massless Dirac fermions.
