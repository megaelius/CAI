Radiation sensors based on the heating effect of the absorbed radiation are typically relatively
simple to operate and flexible in terms of the input frequency. Consequently, they are widely applied,
for example, in gas detection, security, THz imaging, astrophysical observations, and medical
applications. A new spectrum of important applications is currently emerging from quantum technology
and especially from electrical circuits behaving quantum mechanically. This circuit quantum
electrodynamics (cQED) has given rise to unprecedented single-photon detectors and a quantum
computer supreme to the classical supercomputers in a certain task. Thermal sensors are appealing
in enhancing these devices since they are not plagued by quantum noise and are smaller, simpler,
and consume about six orders of magnitude less power than the commonly used traveling-wave parametric
amplifiers. However, despite great progress in the speed and noise levels of thermal sensors, no
bolometer to date has proven fast and sensitive enough to provide advantages in cQED. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate a bolometer surpassing this threshold with a noise equivalent power of $30\, \rm{zW}/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$
on par with the current record while providing two-orders of magnitude shorter thermal time constant
of 500 ns. Importantly, both of these characteristic numbers have been measured directly from the
same device, which implies a faithful estimation of the calorimetric energy resolution of a single
30-GHz photon. These improvements stem from the utilization of a graphene monolayer as the active
material with extremely low specific heat. The minimum demonstrated time constant of 200 ns falls
greatly below the state-of-the-art dephasing times of roughly 100 {\mu}s for superconducting
qubits and meets the timescales of contemporary readout schemes thus enabling the utilization
of thermal detectors in cQED.
