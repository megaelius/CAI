\emph{Probabilistic hysteresis} is a manifestation of irreversibility in a small, isolated classical
system [Sci. Rep. 9, 14169]: after a slow cyclic sweep of a control parameter, the probability that
a microcanonical ensemble returns to the neighborhood of its initial energy is significantly below
one. A similar phenomenon has recently been confirmed in a corresponding quantum system for not
too small particle number $N$. Quantum-classical correspondence has been found to be non-trivial
in this case, however; the rate at which the control parameter changes must not be extremely slow
and the initial distribution of energies must not be too narrow. In this paper we directly compare
the quantum and classical forms of probabilistic hysteresis by making use of the Husimi quantum
phase space formalism. In particular we demonstrate that the classical ergodization mechanism,
which is a key ingredient in classical probabilistic hysteresis, can lead to a breakdown of quantum-classical
correspondence rather than to quantum ergodization. As a result strong quantum effects in the long-term
evolution are present, even though the quantum corrections in the equations of motion are proportional
to $1/N$ and therefore would naively seem to be small. We also show, however, that quantum ergodization
is restored by averaging over energies, so that for sufficient initial energy width and not-too-slow
sweep rate the classical results are recovered after all. Finally we show that the formal incommutability
of the classical and adiabatic limits in our system, leading to the breakdown of quantum-classical
correspondence in the quasi-static limit, is due to macroscopic quantum tunneling through a large
energetic barrier. This explains the extremely slow sweep rates needed to reach the quantum adiabatic
limit that were reported in our previous work.
