We present a consistent and comprehensive treatise on the foundations of the extended Hamilton-Lagrange
formalism--where the dynamical system is parameterized along a general system evolution parameter
$s$, and the time $t$ is treated as a dependent variable $t(s)$ on equal footing with all other configuration
space variables $q^{i}(s)$. In the action principle, the conventional classical action $L dt$
is then replaced by the generalized action $L_{1}ds$, with $L$ and $L_{1}$ denoting the conventional
and the extended Lagrangian, respectively. It is shown that a unique correlation of $L_{1}$ and
$L$ exists if we refrain from performing simultaneously a transformation of the dynamical variables.
With the appropriate correlation of $L_{1}$ and $L$ in place, the extension of the formalism preserves
its canonical form. In the extended formalism, the dynamical system is described as a constrained
motion within an extended space. We show that the value of the constraint and the parameter $s$ constitutes
an additional pair of canonically conjugate variables. In the corresponding quantum system, we
thus encounter an additional uncertainty relation. We derive the extended Lagrangian $L_{1}$
of a classical relativistic point particle in an external electromagnetic field and show that the
generalized path integral approach yields the Klein-Gordon equation as the corresponding quantum
description. We furthermore derive the space-time propagator for a free relativistic particle
from its extended Lagrangian $L_{1}$. These results can be regarded as the proof of principle of
the relativistic generalization of Feynman's path integral approach to quantum physics.
