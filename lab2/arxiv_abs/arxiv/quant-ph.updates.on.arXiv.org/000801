In the non-Markovian regime, the bath has the memory about the past behavior of the open quantum system.
This memory has slowly-decaying power-law tails. Such a long-range character of the memory complicates
the description of the resulting real-time dynamics on large time scales. In a numerical simulation,
this problem manifests itself in a `revival', a spurious reflected signal which appears after a
finite time thus invalidating the simulation. In the present work, we approach this problem and
develop a numerical discretization of the bath without revivals. We find that a crucial role is played
by the singularities of the bath spectral density (e.g. edges of bands): the memory about the (spectral)
behaviour of the open system in the remote past is completely averaged out (forgotten), except an
increasingly small vicinity of these singular frequencies. Therefore, we introduce the concept
of memory channel, to denote such an irreversible information loss process around a particular
singular frequency. On a technical side, we begin the treatment by noting that with respect to the
memory loss, the quantum field of the bath should be divided into the following two different parts:
the observable and the virtual quanta. Information about the former is never lost: they contribute
to the trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The only way to avoid the revival from the observable
quanta is to calculate their dynamics exactly. We do this by employing a stochastic sampling of the
Husimi function of the bath. The other part, the virtual quanta, are always annihilated after a certain
delay time. We construct a dedicated quantum representation for the virtual states by assigning
amplitudes to the delay times before annihilation. It is in this representation we rigorously define
the concept of memory channels.
