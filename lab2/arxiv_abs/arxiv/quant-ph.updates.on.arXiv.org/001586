The (one-dimensional) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian, augmented by spin-orbit coupling
and longer-range hopping, is studied at half filling for an even number of sites. The ground-state
phase diagram depends sensitively on the symmetry of the model. Charge-conjugation (particle-hole)
symmetry is conserved if hopping is only allowed between the two sublattices of even and odd sites.
In this case (of BDI symmetry) we find a variety of topologically non-trivial phases, characterized
by different numbers of edge states (or, equivalently, different quantized Zak phases). The transitions
between these phases are clearly signalled by the entanglement entropy. Charge-conjugation symmetry
is broken if hopping within the sublattices is admitted (driving the system into the AI symmetry
class). We study specifically next-nearest-neighbor hopping with amplitudes $t_a$ and $t_b$
for the $A$ and $B$ sublattices, respectively. For $t_a=t_b$ parity is conserved, and also the quantized
Zak phases remain unchanged in the gapped regions of the phase diagram. However, metallic patches
appear due to the overlap between conduction and valence bands in some regions of parameter space.
The case of alternating next-nearest neighbor hopping, $t_a=-t_b$, is also remarkable, as it breaks
both charge-conjugation $C$ and parity $P$ but conserves the product $CP$. Both the Zak phase and
the entanglement spectrum still provide relevant information, in particular about the broken
parity. Thus the Zak phase for small values of $t_a$ measures the disparity between bond strengths
on $A$ and $B$ sublattices, in close analogy to the proportionality between the Zak phase and the
polarization in the case of the related Aubry-Andr\'e model.
