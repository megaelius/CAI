A necessary first step in the development of technologies such as artificial photosynthesis is
understanding the photoexcitation process within the basic building blocks of naturally-occurring
light harvesting complexes (LHCs). The most important of these building blocks in biological LHCs
such as LHC II from green plants are the chlorophyll $a$ (Chl $a$) and chlorophyll $b$ (Chl $b$) chromophores
dispersed throughout the protein matrix. However, efforts to describe such systems are still hampered
by the lack of computationally efficient and accurate methods that are able to describe optical
absorption in large biomolecules. In this work we employ a highly efficient linear combination
of atomic orbitals (LCAOs) to represent the Kohn--Sham (KS) wave functions at the density functional
theory (DFT) level and perform time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in either the reciprocal
space and frequency domain (LCAO-TDDFT-$k$-$\omega$) or real space and time (LCAO-TDDFT-$r$-$t$)
calculations of the optical absorption spectra of Chl $a$ and $b$ monomers and dimers. We find our
LCAO-TDDFT-$k$-$\omega$ and LCAO-TDDFT-$r$-$t$ calculations reproduce results obtained with
a plane wave (PW) representation of the KS wave functions (PW-TDDFT-$k$-$\omega$), but with a significant
reduction in computational effort. Moreover, by applying the GLLB-SC derivative discontinuity
correction $\Delta_x$ to the KS eigenenergies, with both LCAO-TDDFT-$k$-$\omega$ and LCAO-TDDFT-$r$-$t$
methods we are able to semi-quantitatively reproduce the experimentally measured photoinduced
dissociation (PID) results. This work opens the path to first principles calculations of optical
excitations in macromolecular systems.
