It is difficult to discriminate between the state of initial time $t_0$ and that of time $t_0+\Delta
t$. The task of discriminating between the two states can be interpreted as the hypothesis testing
problem as to a state $\rho$ deciding whether $\rho$ is $\rho_{t_0}$ or$\rho_{t_0+\Delta t}$ We
show the process of optimization of this hypotheses testing and the condition that discrimination
between the two states become difficult even when optimized test was executed. In addition, We consider
time-enegy uncertainty relation from the viewpoint of optimized hypotheses testing. Optimization
consists of two steps. The first step is to optimize the decision rule based on the outcome of the given
measurement by the Neyman-Pearson theorem. The second step is to select optimum measurement in
order to maximize the power of test. The optimum measurement is proved to be $\{ |0\rangle \langle
0|,1-|0\rangle \langle 0|\}$ and the power of test in the optimized test holds $\gamma_{Max}=1-\exp(-\frac{2n}{\hbar^2}\Delta
t^2\Delta H^2)+o(\Delta t^2)$ when $\Delta t \ll 1$ satisfies,where n is the number of the data.
It will be impossible to discriminate between the two states when the power of this test declines.
This condition becomes $\frac{2n}{\hbar^2}\Delta t^2\Delta H^2\ll 1$ in the optimized hypotheses
testing. It is remarkable that the optimum measurement is composed of the operators $Q_0$ and $1-Q_0$
in the proof of time-energy uncertainty relation. Namely, the time-energy uncertainty relation
presents the time interval in which even the optimum measurement hardly detect modification of
the initial state .
