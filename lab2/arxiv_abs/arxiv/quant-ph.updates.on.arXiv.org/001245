Semi-quantum communication, a model introduced in 2007 by M. Boyer, D. Kenigsberg, and T. Mor (PRL
99 140501), involves the use of fully-quantum users and semi-quantum, or "classical" users. These
restricted users are only allowed to interact with the quantum channel in a limited manner. Originally
introduced to study the key-distribution problem, semi-quantum research has since expanded,
and continues to grow, with new protocols, security proof methods, experimental implementations,
and new cryptographic applications beyond key distribution. Research in the field of semi-quantum
cryptography requires new insights into working with restricted protocols and, so, the tools and
techniques derived in this field can translate to results in broader quantum information science.
Furthermore, other questions such as the connection between quantum and classical processing,
including how classical information processing can be used to counteract a quantum deficiency
in a protocol, can shed light on important theoretical questions. This work surveys the history
and current state-of-the-art in semi-quantum research. We discuss the model and several protocols
offering the reader insight into how protocols are constructed in this realm. We discuss security
proof methods and how classical post-processing can be used to counteract users' inability to perform
certain quantum operations. Moving beyond key distribution, we survey current work in other semi-quantum
cryptographic protocols and current trends. We also survey recent work done in attempting to construct
practical semi-quantum systems including recent experimental results in this field. Finally,
as this is still a growing field, we highlight, throughout this survey, several open problems that
we feel are important to investigate in the hopes that this will spur even more research in this topic.
