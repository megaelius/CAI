The act of measurement of an observable for a quantum state is supposed to "collapse" the state into
one of the several states that the initial state has non-zero projection onto. Measurement is sometimes
described as outside standard quantum-mechanical evolution and not calculable from Schr\"odinger's
equation \cite{Wheeler,Borg}. An explicit physical realization of the process of measurement
has been studied intensively by Allahverdyan et. al\cite{Balian1, Balian2}, using the Liouiville-von
Neumann density matrix formalism. While this paper describes a study of the Schr\"odinger equation
with a time-dependent Hamiltonian directly, it is different in that we do not require a Curie-Weiss
type of paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition to achieve similar results. However, it is similar
in that the macroscopic number of variables that are affected are the root of the rapid collapse and
registration. To this end, this paper tackles the evolution of the state of an electron as it goes
through double slits, with a detection mechanism at one of the slits. We model the actual process
of checking whether the electron has gone through one particular slit. The process of detection
and its amplification requires external energy, in order to ensure collapse. We study this process
with a simplified Hamiltonian that captures all the essential ingredients and demonstrate that
the measurement ( if successful) mathematically "collapses the wave-function". Depending on
the structure of the continuum of states of the measuring apparatus, the "collapse" will eventually
reverse in a small system, as we demonstrate in a finite system. The time-scale of such reversal in
typical macroscopic systems is longer than the age of the Universe; effectively, the wave-function
has indeed "collapsed" upon measurement.
