We review the literature on the Pauli equation and its current density, discussing the progression
from the original phenomenological version of Pauli to its derivation by Levy-Leblond from a linearization
of the Schrodinger equation. It was established conclusively by this work that the spin of a spin-1/2
particle such as an electron is non-relativistic in nature, contrary to what was often stated following
Dirac's derivation of a relativistic wave equation for the electron, and his subsequent demonstration
that Pauli's spin interaction with an external magnetic field appeared in the non-relativistic
limit. In this limit, the Gordon decomposition of the associated probability current density was
found to contain a spin-dependent term. Such a term does not follow, however, from the usual derivation
of the current density from the Pauli equation, although various physically motivated but otherwise
ad hoc explanations were put forward to account for it. We comment on the sole exception to these ad
hoc approaches that we are aware of, indicating that the spin term in the current was in fact non-relativistic
in nature. However, the earlier work of Levy-Leblond had already shown with no additional assumptions
that this term was in fact a prominent feature of the current density derived from his equation. Hence,
just as with the spin itself, the spin current was non-relativistic, claims to the contrary found
in the literature notwithstanding. We present a somewhat simplified derivation of the Levy-Leblond
equation and its current density, commenting on possibilities for experimental work that might
indicate measurable consequences of the spin term in the current density.
