A system gradually driven through a symmetry-breaking phase transition is subject to the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism (KZM). As a consequence of the critical slowing down, its state cannot follow local equilibrium,
and its evolution becomes non-adiabatic near the critical point. In the simplest approximation,
that stage can be regarded as "impulse" where the state of the system remains unchanged. It leads
to the correct KZM scaling laws. However, such "freeze-out" might suggest that the coherence length
of the nascent order parameter remains unchanged as the critical region is traversed. By contrast,
the original causality-based discussion emphasized the role of the {\it sonic horizon}: domains
of the broken symmetry phase can expand with a velocity limited by the speed of the relevant sound.
This effect was demonstrated in the quantum Ising chain where the dynamical exponent $z=1$ and quasiparticles
excited by the transition have a fixed speed of sound. To elucidate the role of the sonic horizon,
in this paper we study two systems with $z>1$ where the speed of sound is no longer fixed, and the fastest
excited quasiparticles set the size of the sonic horizon. Their effective speed decays with the
increasing transition time. In the extreme case, the dynamical exponent $z$ can diverge such as
in the Griffiths region of the random Ising chain where localization of excited quasiparticles
freezes the growth of the correlation range when the critical region is traversed. Of particular
interest is an example with $z<1$ --- the long-range extended Ising chain, where there is no upper
limit to the velocity of excited quasiparticles with small momenta. Initially, the power-law tail
of the correlation function grows adiabatically, but in the non-adiabatic stage it lags behind
the adiabatic evolution---in accord with a generalized Lieb-Robinson bound.
