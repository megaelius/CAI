According to the received conception of physics, a valid physical theory is presumed to describe
the objective evolution of a unique external world. However, this assumption is challenged by quantum
theory, which indicates that physical systems do not always have objective properties which are
simply revealed by measurement. Furthermore, several other conceptual puzzles in the foundations
of physics and related fields point to possible limitations of the received perspective and motivate
the exploration of alternatives. Thus, here I propose an alternative approach which starts with
the concept of "observation" as its primary notion, and does not from the outset assume the existence
of a "world" or physical laws. It can be subsumed under a single postulate: Solomonoff induction
correctly predicts future observations. I show that the resulting theory suggests a possible explanation
for why there are simple computable probabilistic laws in the first place. It predicts the emergence
of the notion of an objective external world that has begun in a state of low entropy. It also predicts
that observers will typically see the violation of Bell inequalities despite the validity of the
no-signalling principle. Moreover, it resolves cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem via a "principle
of persistent regularities", and it makes the unusual prediction that the emergent notion of objective
external world breaks down in certain extreme situations, yielding phenomena such as "probabilistic
zombies". Additionally, it makes in principle concrete predictions for some fundamental conceptual
problems relating to the computer simulation of observers. This paper does not claim to exactly
describe "how the world works", but it dares to raise the question of whether the first-person perspective
may be a more fruitful starting point from which to address certain longstanding fundamental issues.
