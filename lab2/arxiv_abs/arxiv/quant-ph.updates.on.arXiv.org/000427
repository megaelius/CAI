In the past years, quantum computers more and more evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality.
IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to
provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum
experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2
and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computer (named
IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the
desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to properly be mapped
so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands for solutions
to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology
which addresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which
satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in
terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can
easily be configured for future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK. Experimental
evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution. In
fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture
within less than five minutes (and within a fraction of a second in most cases), while IBM's solution
suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in several cases. As an additional benefit,
the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are
required).
