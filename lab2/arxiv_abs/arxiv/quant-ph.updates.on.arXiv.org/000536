Graph states are ubiquitous in quantum information with diverse applications ranging from quantum
network protocols to measurement based quantum computing. Here we consider the question whether
one graph (source) state can be transformed into another graph (target) state, using a specific
set of quantum operations (LC+LPM+CC): single-qubit Clifford operations (LC), single-qubit
Pauli measurements (LPM) and classical communication (CC) between sites holding the individual
qubits. We first show that deciding whether a graph state |G> can be transformed into another graph
state |G'> using LC+LPM+CC is NP-Complete, even if |G'> is restricted to be the GHZ-state. However,
we also provide efficient algorithms for two situations of practical interest: 1. |G> has Schmidt-rank
width one and |G'> is a GHZ-state. The Schmidt-rank width is an entanglement measure of quantum state,
meaning this algorithm is efficient if the original state has little entanglement. Our algorithm
has runtime O(|V(G')||V(G)|), and is also efficient in practice even on small instances as further
showcased by a freely available software implementation. 2. |G> is in a certain class of states with
unbounded Schmidt-rank width, and |G'> is a GHZ-state of a constant size. Here the runtime is O(poly(|V(G)|)),
showing that more efficient algorithms can in principle be found even for states holding a large
amount of entanglement, as long as the output state has constant size. Our results make use of the
insight that deciding whether a graph state |G> can be transformed to another graph state |G'> is
equivalent to a known decision problem in graph theory, namely the problem of deciding whether a
graph G' is a vertex-minor of a graph G. Many of the technical tools developed to obtain our results
may be of independent interest.
