Many quantum information theoretic quantities are similar to and/or inspired by thermodynamic
quantities, with entanglement entropy being a well-known example. In this paper, we study a less
well-known example, capacity of entanglement, which is the quantum information theoretic counterpart
of heat capacity. It can be defined as the second cumulant of the entanglement spectrum and can be
loosely thought of as the variance in the entanglement entropy. We review the definition of capacity
of entanglement and its relation to various other quantities such as fidelity susceptibility and
Fisher information. We then calculate the capacity of entanglement for various quantum systems,
conformal and non-conformal quantum field theories in various dimensions, and examine their holographic
gravity duals. Resembling the relation between response coefficients and order parameter fluctuations
in Landau-Ginzburg theories, the capacity of entanglement in field theory is related to integrated
gravity fluctuations in the bulk. We address the question of measurability, in the context of proposals
to measure entanglement and R\'enyi entropies by relating them to $U(1)$ charges fluctuating in
and out of a subregion, for systems equivalent to non-interacting fermions. From our analysis,
we find universal features in conformal field theories, in particular the area dependence of the
capacity of entanglement appears to track that of the entanglement entropy. This relation is seen
to be modified under perturbations from conformal invariance. In quenched 1+1 dimensional CFTs,
we compute the rate of growth of the capacity of entanglement. The result may be used to refine the
interpretation of entanglement spreading being carried by ballistic propagation of entangled
quasiparticle pairs created at the quench.
