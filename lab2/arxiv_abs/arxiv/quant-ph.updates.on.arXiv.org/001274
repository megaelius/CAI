Spin qubits in silicon quantum dots are one of the most promising building blocks for large scale
quantum computers thanks to their high qubit density and compatibility with the existing semiconductor
technologies. High fidelity single-qubit gates exceeding the threshold of error correction codes
like the surface code have been demonstrated, while two-qubit gates have reached 98\% fidelity
and are improving rapidly. However, there are other types of error --- such as charge leakage and
propagation --- that may occur in quantum dot arrays and which cannot be corrected by quantum error
correction codes, making them potentially damaging even when their probability is small. We propose
a surface code architecture for silicon quantum dot spin qubits that is robust against leakage errors
by incorporating multi-electron mediator dots. Charge leakage in the qubit dots is transferred
to the mediator dots via charge relaxation processes and then removed using charge reservoirs attached
to the mediators. A stabiliser-check cycle, optimised for our hardware, then removes the correlations
between the residual physical errors. Through simulations we obtain the surface code threshold
for the charge leakage errors and show that in our architecture the damage due to charge leakage errors
is reduced to a similar level to that of the usual depolarising gate noise. Spin leakage errors in
our architecture are constrained to only ancilla qubits and can be removed during quantum error
correction via reinitialisations of ancillae, which ensure the robustness of our architecture
against spin leakage as well. Our use of an elongated mediator dots creates spaces throughout the
quantum dot array for charge reservoirs, measuring devices and control gates, providing the scalability
in the design.
