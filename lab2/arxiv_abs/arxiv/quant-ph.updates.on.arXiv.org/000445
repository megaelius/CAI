Exciton formation leads to J-bands in solid pentacene. Describing these exciton bands represents
a challenge for both time-dependent (TD) density-functional theory (DFT) and for its semiempirical
analogue, namely for TD density-functional tight binding (DFTB) for three reasons (i) solid pentacene
and pentacene aggregates are bound only by van der Waals forces which are notoriously difficult
to describe with DFT and DFTB, (ii) the proper description of the long-range coupling between molecules,
needed to describe Davydov splitting, is not easy to include in TD-DFT with traditional functionals
and in TD-DFTB, and (iii) mixing may occur between local and charge transfer excitons, which may,
in turn, require special functionals. We assess how far TD-DFT and TD-DFTB have progressed towards
a correct description of this type of exciton by including both a dispersion correction for the ground
state and a range-separated hybrid functional for the excited state. Analytic results for parallel-stacked
ethylene are derived which go beyond Kasha's exciton model in that we are able to make a clear distinction
between charge transfer and energy transfer excitons. This is further confirmed when it is shown
that range-separated hybrids have a markedly greater effect on charge-transfer excitons than
on energy-transfer excitons in the case of parallel-stacked pentacenes. TD-DFT calculations
with the CAM-B3LYP functional and TD-lc-DFT calculations lead to negligeable excitonic corrections
for the herringbone crystal structure, possibly because of an overcorrection of charge-transfer
effects. In this case, TD-DFT calculations with the B3LYP functional or TD-DFTB calculations parameterized
to B3LYP give the best results for excitonic corrections for the herringbone crystal structure
as judged from comparison with experimental spectra and with Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations
from the literature.
