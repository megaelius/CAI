Quantum communication complexity studies the efficiency of information communication (that
is, the minimum amount of communication required to achieve a certain task) using quantum states.
One representative example is quantum fingerprinting, in which the simultaneous message passing
model is considered and the minimum amount of communication could be exponentially smaller than
the classical fingerprinting protocol. Experimental demonstrations based on a practical quantum
fingerprinting protocol where coherent states are used to construct the fingerprints, have successfully
shown the superiority of quantum fingerprinting. However, as a consequence of using coherent states,
the communication time in this coherent quantum fingerprinting (CQF) protocol is increased. Moreover,
the minimum amount of information communicated in these experimental demonstrations is largely
limited by the dark counts of the single photon detectors. Here, we propose to enhance the performance
of the existing CQF protocol through applying wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and simultaneous
detection of multiple wavelength channels. We show that the new WDM-CQF protocol can potentially
reduce the communication time significantly. More importantly, with the same experimental parameters,
the amount of communication is much reduced in the new scheme compared with the original CQF protocol.
The more wavelength channels are used, the less communication is required by WDM-CQF protocol.
We also perform a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of the new WDM-CQF protocol with
6 wavelength channels. The experimental results further validate that the new scheme with WDM not
only beats the classical protocol, but also reduces the amount of communication required by the
original CQF protocol by more than half.
