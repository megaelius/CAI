We provide upper bounds on device independent key secure against a non-signaling adversary (NSDI)
achieved by a class of operations, currently used in both quantum and non-signaling device independent
protocols. As the main tool, we introduce a family of measures of non-locality by "squashing" secrecy
monotones known to upper bound secret key in the secret key agreement scenario. In particular a squashed
secret key rate can be considered itself as an upper bound on the key in NSDI, however, we construct
a much more computable example: - the non-signaling squashed intrinsic information of a conditional
distribution (called squashed non-locality). We prove that the squashed non-locality exhibits
several useful properties such as convexity, monotonicity, additivity on the tensor product of
conditional distributions, and asymptotic continuity. Hence, as a measure of non-locality, is
interesting on its own. We demonstrate this approach by numerical upper bounds on this measure,
{that} suggests, in particular, that the non-locality and secrecy in NSDI are not equivalent. We
construct explicit examples of a conditional distribution violating CHSH inequality, from which
no key in NSDI can be obtained with direct measurements and public communication followed by classical
post-processing. We define the secret key rate in terms of the complete extension, a counterpart
of quantum purification in non-signaling scenario, recently introduced in Winczewski et al. [arXiv:1810.02222].
We show that the presented approach is equivalent to the already existing ones, including the one
by H{\"a}nggi Renner and Wolf [EUROCRYPT, 2010]. Finally, we simplify the class of operations attaining
maximal distinguishability of two devices with several unary inputs, and one input of arbitrary
cardinality, which is of independent interest on its own in the context of Generalized Probability
Theories.
