The number of topological defects created in a system driven through a quantum phase transition
exhibits a power-law scaling with the driving time. This universal scaling law is the key prediction
of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), and testing it using a hardware-based quantum simulator is
a coveted goal of quantum information science. Here we provide such a test using quantum annealing.
Specifically, we report on extensive experimental tests of topological defect formation via the
one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on two different D-Wave quantum annealing devices.
We find that the quantum simulator results can indeed be explained by the KZM for open-system quantum
dynamics with phase-flip errors, with certain quantitative deviations from the theory likely
caused by factors such as random control errors and transient effects. In addition, we probe physics
beyond the KZM by identifying signatures of universality in the distribution and cumulants of the
number of kinks and their decay, and again find agreement with the quantum simulator results. This
implies that the theoretical predictions of the generalized KZM theory, which assumes isolation
from the environment, applies beyond its original scope to an open system. We support this result
by extensive numerical computations. To check whether an alternative, classical interpretation
of these results is possible, we used the spin-vector Monte Carlo model, a candidate classical description
of the D-Wave device. We find that the degree of agreement with the experimental data from the D-Wave
annealing devices is better for the KZM, a quantum theory, than for the classical spin-vector Monte
Carlo model, thus favoring a quantum description of the device. Our work provides an experimental
test of quantum critical dynamics in an open quantum system, and paves the way to new directions in
quantum simulation experiments.
