We propose a set of constraints on the ground-state wavefunctions of fracton phases, which provide
a possible generalization of the string-net equations used to characterize topological orders
in two spatial dimensions. Our constraint equations arise by exploiting a duality between certain
fracton orders and quantum phases with "subsystem" symmetries, which are defined as global symmetries
on lower-dimensional manifolds, and then studying the distinct ways in which the defects of a subsystem
symmetry group can be consistently condensed to produce a gapped, symmetric state. We numerically
solve these constraint equations in certain tractable cases to obtain the following results: in
$d=3$ spatial dimensions, the solutions to these equations yield gapped fracton phases that are
distinct as conventional quantum phases, along with their dual subsystem symmetry-protected
topological (SSPT) states. For an appropriate choice of subsystem symmetry group, we recover known
fracton phases such as Haah's code, along with new, symmetry-enriched versions of these phases,
such as non-stabilizer fracton models which are distinct from both the X-cube model and the checkerboard
model in the presence of global time-reversal symmetry, as well as a variety of fracton phases enriched
by spatial symmetries. In $d=2$ dimensions, we find solutions that describe new weak and strong
SSPT states, such as ones with both line-like subsystem symmetries and global time-reversal symmetry.
In $d=1$ dimension, we show that any group cohomology solution for a symmetry-protected topological
state protected by a global symmetry, along with lattice translational symmetry necessarily satisfies
our consistency conditions.
