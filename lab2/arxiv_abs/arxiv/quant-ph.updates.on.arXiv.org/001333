Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and symmetric informationally complete projectors (SICs) are
central to many conceptual and practical aspects of quantum theory. In this work, we investigate
their role in quantum nonlocality. For every integer $d\geq 2$, we introduce Bell inequalities
for which pairs of $d$-dimensional MUBs and SICs, respectively, produce the largest violations
allowed in quantum mechanics. To investigate whether these inequalities can be used for the purpose
of device-independent certification of measurements, we show that the concepts of MUBs and SICs
admit a natural operational interpretation which does not depend on the dimension of the underlying
Hilbert space. We prove that the maximal quantum violations certify precisely these operational
notions. In the case of MUBs we also show that the maximal violation certifies the presence of a maximally
entangled state of local dimension $d$ and that the maximal violation is achieved by a unique probability
distribution. This constitutes the first example of an extremal point of the quantum set which admits
physically inequivalent quantum realisations, i.e.~is not a self-test. Finally, we investigate
the performance of our Bell inequalities in two tasks of practical relevance. We show that the Bell
inequalities for MUBs guarantee the optimal key rate in a device-independent quantum key distribution
protocol with $d$ outcomes. Moreover, using the Bell inequalities for SICs, we show how qubit and
qutrit systems can generate more device-independent randomness than higher-dimensional implementations
based on standard projective measurements. We also investigate the robustness of the key and randomness
generation schemes to noise. The results establish the relevance of MUBs and SICs for both fundamental
and applied considerations in quantum nonlocality.
