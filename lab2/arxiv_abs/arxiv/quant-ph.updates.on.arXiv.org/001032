The growing field of quantum computing is based on the concept of a q-bit which is a delicate superposition
of 0 and 1, requiring cryogenic temperatures for its physical realization along with challenging
coherent coupling techniques for entangling them. By contrast, a probabilistic bit or a p-bit is
a robust classical entity that fluctuates between 0 and 1, and can be implemented at room temperature
using present-day technology. Just as three-terminal transistors provide a building block for
large functional circuits, a three terminal realization of the p-bit can provide a building block
for p-circuits that has been shown to perform a variety of useful functions. In this paper, we introduce
a new application of p-circuits, namely to perform Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations
of quantum systems based on the well-known Suzuki-Trotter decomposition that maps a $d$-dimensional
quantum many body Hamiltonian to a $d$+1-dimensional classical Hamiltonian. This approach allowing
a quantum system to be emulated by a number of classical replicas is commonly used in software or high-level
hardware simulations. What we show here is that it should be possible to build low-level hardware
accelerators that use replicated p-bits to emulate a given q-bit network. Using full device-level
SPICE simulations we demonstrate that the correct quantum correlations can be obtained using a
classical p-circuit built with existing technology and operating at room temperature. Another
advantage of p-bit networks is that they can be interconnected using conventional electronic devices
such as GPUs or FPGAs. This could allow complex connectivity beyond nearest neighbor coupling as
well as the implementation of arbitrary $k$-body interactions with $k > 2$.
