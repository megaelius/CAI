We propose a principled way of defining and measuring contextuality in systems with deterministic
inputs and random outputs. We illustrate it on systems with two binary inputs and two binary random
outputs, the prominent example being the system of two entangled spin-half particles with each
particle's spins (random outputs) being measured along one of two directions (inputs). It is traditional
to say that such a system exhibits contextuality when it violates Bell-type inequalities. Derivations
of Bell-type inequalities, however, are based on the assumption of no-signaling, more generally
referred to as marginal selectivity: the distributions of outputs (spins) in Alice's particle
do not depend on the inputs (directions chosen) for Bob's particle. In many applications this assumption
is not satisfied, so that instead of contextuality one has to speak of direct cross-influences,
e.g., of Bob's settings on Alice's spin distributions. While in quantum physics direct cross-influences
can sometimes be prevented (e.g., by space-like separation of the two particles), in other applications,
especially in behavioral and social systems, marginal selectivity almost never holds. It is unsatisfying
that the highly meaningful notion of contextuality is made inapplicable by even slightest violations
of marginal selectivity. Our new approach rectifies this: it allows one to define and measure contextuality
on top of direct cross-influences, irrespective of whether marginal selectivity (no-signaling
condition) holds. For systems with two binary inputs and two binary random outputs, contextuality
means violation of the classical CHSH inequalities in which the upper bound 2 is replaced with 2\left(1+\Delta_{0}\right),
where \Delta_{0} is a measure of deviation from marginal selectivity.
