We describe a novel iterative strategy for Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations aimed
at large systems (> 1000 electrons), applicable to metals and insulators alike. In lieu of explicit
diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian on every self-consistent field (SCF) iteration,
we employ a two-level Chebyshev polynomial filter based complementary subspace strategy to: 1)
compute a set of vectors that span the occupied subspace of the Hamiltonian; 2) reduce subspace diagonalization
to just partially occupied states; and 3) obtain those states in an efficient, scalable manner via
an inner Chebyshev-filter iteration. By reducing the necessary computation to just partially
occupied states, and obtaining these through an inner Chebyshev iteration, our approach reduces
the cost of large metallic calculations significantly, while eliminating subspace diagonalization
for insulating systems altogether. We describe the implementation of the method within the framework
of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) electronic structure method and show that this results in a computational
scheme that can effectively tackle bulk and nano systems containing tens of thousands of electrons,
with chemical accuracy, within a few minutes or less of wall clock time per SCF iteration on large-scale
computing platforms. We anticipate that our method will be instrumental in pushing the envelope
of large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics. As a demonstration of this, we simulate a bulk silicon
system containing 8,000 atoms at finite temperature, and obtain an average SCF step wall time of
51 seconds on 34,560 processors; thus allowing us to carry out 1.0 ps of ab initio molecular dynamics
in approximately 28 hours (of wall time).
