The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as one of the most promising near-term quantum
algorithms that can be used to simulate many-body systems such as molecular electronic structures.
Serving as an attractive ansatz in the VQE algorithm, unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory has seen
a renewed interest in recent literature. However, unlike the original classical UCC theory, implementation
on a quantum computer requires a finite-order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition to separate the exponentials
of the large sum of Pauli operators. While previous literature has recognized the non-uniqueness
of different orderings of the operators in the Trotterized form of UCC methods, the question of whether
or not different orderings matter at the chemical scale has not been addressed. In this letter, we
explore the effect of operator ordering on the Trotterized UCCSD ansatz, as well as the much more
compact $k$-UpCCGSD ansatz recently proposed by Lee et al. We observe a significant, system-dependent
variation in the energies of Trotterizations with different operator orderings. The energy variations
occur on a chemical scale, sometimes on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. This letter establishes
the need to define not only the operators present in the ansatz, but also the order in which they appear.
This is necessary for adhering to the quantum chemical notion of a "model chemistry", in addition
to the general importance of scientific reproducibility. As a final note, we suggest a useful strategy
to select out of the combinatorial number of possibilities, a single well-defined and effective
ordering of the operators.
