In PT quantum mechanics a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, that the Hamiltonian must
be hermitian, is replaced by another set of requirements, including notably symmetry under PT,
where P denotes parity and T denotes time reversal. Here we study the role of boundary conditions
in PT quantum mechanics by constructing a simple model that is the PT symmetric analog of a particle
in a box. The model has the usual particle in a box Hamiltonian but boundary conditions that respect
PT symmetry rather than hermiticity. We find that for a broad class of PT-symmetric boundary conditions
the model respects the condition of unbroken PT-symmetry, namely that the Hamiltonian and the symmetry
operator PT have simultaneous eigenfunctions, implying that the energy eigenvalues are real.
We also find that the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint under the PT inner product. Thus we obtain a simple
soluble model that fulfils all the requirements of PT quantum mechanics. In the second part of this
paper we formulate a variational principle for PT quantum mechanics that is the analog of the textbook
Rayleigh-Ritz principle. Finally we consider electromagnetic analogs of the PT-symmetric particle
in a box. We show that the isolated particle in a box may be realized as a Fabry-Perot cavity between
an absorbing medium and its conjugate gain medium. Coupling the cavity to an external continuum
of incoming and outgoing states turns the energy levels of the box into sharp resonances. Remarkably
we find that the resonances have a Breit-Wigner lineshape in transmission and a Fano lineshape in
reflection; by contrast in the corresponding hermitian case the lineshapes always have a Breit-Wigner
form in both transmission and reflection.
