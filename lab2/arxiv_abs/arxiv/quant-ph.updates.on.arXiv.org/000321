We analyze the lowest achievable temperature for a mechanical oscillator (representing, for example,
the motion of a single trapped ion) which is coupled with a driven quantum refrigerator. The refrigerator
is composed of a parametrically driven system (which we also consider to be a single oscillator in
the simplest case) which is coupled to a reservoir where the energy is dumped. We show that the cooling
of the oscillator (that can be achieved due to the resonant transport of its phonon excitations into
the environment) is always stopped by a fundamental heating process that is always dominant at sufficiently
low temperatures. This process can be described as the non resonant production of excitation pairs.
This result is in close analogy with the recent study that showed that pair production is responsible
for enforcing the validity of the dynamical version of the third law of thermodynamics (Phys. Rev.
E 95, 012146). Interestingly, we relate our model to the usual ones used to describe laser cooling
of a single trapped ion and reobtaining the correct limiting temperatures for the limits of resolved
and non-resolved sidebands. Our findings (that also serve to estimate the lowest temperatures
that can be achieved in a variety of other situations) indicate that the limit for laser cooling can
also be associated with non resonant pair production. In fact, as we show, this is the case: The limiting
temperature for laser cooling is achieved when the cooling transitions induced by the resonant
transport of excitations from the motion into the electromagnetic environment is compensated
by the heating transitions induced by the creation of phonon-photon pairs.
