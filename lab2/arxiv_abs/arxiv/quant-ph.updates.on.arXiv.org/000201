In quantum information processing it may be possible to have efficient computation and secure communication
beyond the limitations of classical systems. In a fundamental point of view, however, evolution
of quantum systems by the laws of quantum mechanics is more restrictive than classical systems,
identified to a specific form of dynamics, that is, unitary transformations and, consequently,
positive and completely positive maps to subsystems. This also characterizes classes of disallowed
transformations on quantum systems, among which positive but not completely maps are of particular
interest as they characterize entangled states, a general resource in quantum information processing.
Structural physical approximation offers a systematic way of approximating those non-physical
maps, positive but not completely positive maps, with quantum channels. Since it has been proposed
as a method of detecting entangled states, it has stimulated fundamental problems on classifications
of positive maps and the structure of Hermitian operators and quantum states, as well as on quantum
measurement such as quantum design in quantum information theory. It has developed efficient and
feasible methods of directly detecting entangled states in practice, for which proof-of-principle
experimental demonstrations have also been performed with photonic qubit states. Here, we present
a comprehensive review on quantum information processing with structural physical approximations
and the related progress. The review mainly focuses on properties of structural physical approximations
and their applications toward practical information applications.
