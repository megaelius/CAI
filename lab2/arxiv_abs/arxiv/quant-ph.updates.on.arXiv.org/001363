This thesis contributes to the understanding of symmetry-enriched topological phases focusing
on their descriptions in terms of tensor network states. The Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS)
formalism allows us to locally encode the main properties of the models (like topological order,
symmetries and their interplay) in the tensors. We have used that encoding to classify, construct
and detect some classes of symmetry-enriched topological phases in 2D PEPS. For that purpose, we
have studied what the allowed freedom in the tensors generating the same tensor network state is.
These results are the so-called 'fundamental theorems' and they give the necessary knowledge to
properly study symmetries (actions that leave the states invariant). We focus our study on the family
of PEPS describing quantum double models of $G$, the so-called $G$-injective PEPS, and on global
on-site symmetries coming from a finite group $Q$: as a result of the classification we have a finite
number of phases closely related to the theory of group extensions. We also provide the maps that
appear in group extension theory with physical meaning and we characterize their actions on the
ground subspace and on the anyons. We construct a representative of each class of our classification.
Moreover, we connect our construction with an interesting physical phenomenon, the so-called
anyon condensation, which describes topological phase transitions. We have also proposed a family
of gauge invariant quantities and their corresponding order parameters (in the form of expectation
values of a local operator in 2D) to detect the corresponding quantum phases, in particular their
symmetry fractionalization patterns. We conclude this thesis by touching on some mathematical
open problems in PEPS.
