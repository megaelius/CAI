Heat-Bath Algorithmic Cooling is a set of techniques for producing highly pure quantum systems
by utilizing a surrounding heat-bath and unitary interactions. These techniques originally used
the thermal environment only to fully thermalize ancillas at the environment temperature. Here
we extend HBAC protocols by optimizing over the thermalization strategy. We find, for any $d$-dimensional
system in an arbitrary initial state, provably optimal cooling protocols with surprisingly simple
structure and exponential convergence to the ground state. Compared to the standard ones, these
schemes can use fewer or no ancillas and exploit memory effects to enhance cooling. We verify that
the optimal protocols are robusts to various deviations from the ideal scenario. For a single target
qubit, the optimal protocol can be well approximated with a Jaynes-Cummings interaction between
the system and a single thermal bosonic mode for a wide range of environmental temperatures. This
admits an experimental implementation close to the setup of a micromaser, with a performance competitive
with leading proposals in the literature. The proposed protocol provides an experimental setup
that illustrates how non-Markovianity can be harnessed to improve cooling. On the technical side
we 1. introduce a new class of states called maximally active states and discuss their thermodynamic
significance in terms of optimal unitary control, 2. introduce a new set of thermodynamic processes,
called $\beta$-permutations, whose access is sufficient to simulate a generic thermalization
process, 3. show how to use abstract toolbox developed within the resource theory approach to thermodynamics
to perform challenging optimizations, while combining it with open quantum system dynamics tools
to approximate optimal solutions within physically realistic setups.
