Many existing quantum supervised learning (SL) schemes consider data given a priori in a classical
description. With only noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices available in the near
future, their quantum speedup awaits the development of quantum random access memories (qRAMs)
and fault-tolerant quantum computing. There, however, also exist a multitude of SL tasks whose
data are acquired by sensors, e.g., pattern classification based on data produced by imaging sensors.
Solving such SL tasks naturally requires an integrated approach harnessing tools from both quantum
sensing and quantum computing. We introduce supervised learning assisted by an entangled sensor
network (SLAEN) as a means to carry out SL tasks at the physical layer. The entanglement shared by
the sensors in SLAEN boosts the performance of extracting global features of the object under investigation.
We leverage SLAEN to construct an entanglement-assisted support-vector machine for data classification
and entanglement-assisted principal component analyzer for data compression. In both schemes,
variational circuits are employed to seek the optimum entangled probe states and measurement settings
to maximize the entanglement-enabled {enhancement}. We observe that SLAEN enjoys an appreciable
entanglement-enabled performance gain, even in the presence of loss, over conventional strategies
in which classical data are acquired by separable sensors and subsequently processed by classical
SL algorithms. SLAEN is realizable with available technology, opening a viable route toward building
NISQ devices that offer unmatched performance beyond what the optimum classical device is able
to afford.
