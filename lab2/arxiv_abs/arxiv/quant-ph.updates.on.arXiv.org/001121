Infinite quasiperiodic arrangements in space, such as quasicrystals, are typically described
as projections of higher-dimensional periodic lattices onto the physical dimension. The concept
of a reference higher-dimensional space, called a superspace, has proved useful in relation to
quasiperiodic systems. Although some quantum-mechanical systems in quasiperiodic media have
been shown to admit quasiperiodic states, any sort of general Hamiltonian formalism in superspace
is lacking to this date. Here, we show how to extend generic quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians to
higher dimensions in such a way that eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are obtained as projections
of the Hamiltonian in superspace, which we call the super Hamiltonian. We apply the super Hamiltonian
formalism to a simple, yet realistic one-dimensional quantum particle in a quasiperiodic potential
without the tight-binding approximation, and obtain continuously labelled eigenstates of the
system corresponding to a continuous spectrum. All states corresponding to the continuum are quasiperiodic.
We also obtain the Green's functions for continuum states in closed form and, from them, the density
of states and local density of states, and scattering states off defects and impurities. The closed
form of this one-dimensional Green's function is equally valid for any continuum state in any one-dimensional
single-particle quantum system admitting continuous spectrum. With the basis set we use, which
is periodic in superspace, and therefore quasiperiodic in physical space, we find that Anderson-localised
states are also quasiperiodic if distributional solutions are admitted, but circumvent this difficulty
by generalising the superspace method to open boundary conditions (cont'd).
