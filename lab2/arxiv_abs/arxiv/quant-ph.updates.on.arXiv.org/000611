We derive universal entanglement entropy and Schmidt eigenvalue behaviors for the eigenstates
of two quantum chaotic systems coupled with a weak interaction. The progression from a lack of entanglement
in the noninteracting limit to the entanglement expected of fully randomized states in the opposite
limit is governed by the single scaling transition parameter, $\Lambda$. The behaviors apply equally
well to few- and many-body systems, e.g.\ interacting particles in quantum dots, spin chains, coupled
quantum maps, and Floquet systems as long as their subsystems are quantum chaotic, and not localized
in some manner. To calculate the generalized moments of the Schmidt eigenvalues in the perturbative
regime, a regularized theory is applied, whose leading order behaviors depend on $\sqrt{\Lambda}$.
The marginal case of the $1/2$ moment, which is related to the distance to closest maximally entangled
state, is an exception having a $\sqrt{\Lambda}\ln \Lambda$ leading order and a logarithmic dependence
on subsystem size. A recursive embedding of the regularized perturbation theory gives a simple
exponential behavior for the von Neumann entropy and the Havrda-Charv{\' a}t-Tsallis entropies
for increasing interaction strength, demonstrating a universal transition to nearly maximal
entanglement. Moreover, the full probability densities of the Schmidt eigenvalues, i.e.\ the
entanglement spectrum, show a transition from power laws and L\'evy distribution in the weakly
interacting regime to random matrix results for the strongly interacting regime. The predicted
behaviors are tested on a pair of weakly interacting kicked rotors, which follow the universal behaviors
extremely well.
