Nonclassical correlations provide a resource for many applications in quantum technology as well
as providing strong evidence that a system is indeed operating in the quantum regime. Optomechanical
systems can be arranged to generate quantum entanglement between the mechanics and a mode of travelling
light. Here we propose automated optimisation of the production of quantum correlations in such
a system, beyond what can be achieved through analytical methods, by applying Bayesian optimisation
to the control parameters. Two-mode optomechanical squeezing experiment is simulated using a
detailed theoretical model of the system, while the Bayesian optimisation process modifies the
controllable parameters in order to maximise the non-classical two-mode squeezing and its detection,
independently of the inner workings of the model. The Bayesian optimisation treats the simulations
or the experiments as a black box. This we refer to as \emph{theory-blind} optimisation, and the
optimisation process is designed to be unaware of whether it is working with a simulation or the actual
experimental setup. We find that in the experimentally relevant thermal regimes, the ability to
vary and optimise a broad array of control parameters provides access to large values of two-mode
squeezing that would otherwise be difficult or intractable to discover. In particular we observe
that modulation of the driving frequency around the resonant sideband, when added to the set of control
parameters, produces strong nonclassical correlations greater on average than the maximum achieved
by optimising over the remaining parameters. We also find that using our optimisation approach
raises the upper limit to the thermal regime in which squeezing can be achieved. This extends the
range of experimental setups in which non-classical correlations could be generated beyond the
region of high quantum cooperativity.
