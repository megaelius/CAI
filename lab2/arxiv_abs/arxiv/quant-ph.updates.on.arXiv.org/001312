As research on building scalable quantum computers advances, it is important to be able to certify
their correctness. Due to the exponential hardness of classically simulating quantum computation,
straight-forward verification through classical simulation fails. However, we can classically
simulate small scale quantum computations and hence we are able to test that devices behave as expected
in this domain. This constitutes the first step towards obtaining confidence in the anticipated
quantum-advantage when we extend to scales which can no longer be simulated. Realistic devices
have restrictions due to their architecture and limitations due to physical imperfections and
noise. Here we extend the usual ideal simulations by considering those effects. We provide a general
methodology for constructing realistic simulations emulating the physical system which will
both provide a benchmark for realistic devices, and guide experimental research in the quest for
quantum-advantage. We exemplify our methodology by simulating a networked architecture and corresponding
noise-model; in particular that of the device developed in the Networked Quantum Information Technologies
Hub (NQIT). For our simulations we use, with suitable modification, the classical simulator of
of Bravyi and Gosset. The specific problems considered belong to the class of Instantaneous Quantum
Polynomial-time (IQP) problems, a class believed to be hard for classical computing devices, and
to be a promising candidate for the first demonstration of quantum-advantage. We first consider
a subclass of IQP, defined by Bermejo-Vega et al, involving two-dimensional dynamical quantum
simulators, before moving to more general instances of IQP, but which are still restricted to the
architecture of NQIT.
