Quantum enhanced measurement termed as quantum metrology is important for quantum information
science and technology. A crucial measure for the minimum achievable statistical uncertainty
in the estimation of the parameters is given by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Although QFI
of closed systems has been investigated, how the nonequilibrium environments influence the QFI
of open systems remains elusive. In this study, we consider a two-fermionic open system immersed
in two fermionic reservoirs, and investigate how nonequilibrium environments influence the quantum
Fisher information (QFI) and explore the relationship between the QFI and the entanglement strength
of this open system. The parameters to be estimated are the inter-site tunneling rate $\Delta$ and
the coupling strength $\Gamma_1$ between one fermion site and the environment it is in contact with.
We find that when the tunneling rate is small, its QFI $\mathcal{F}_{\Delta}$ predominantly increases
with the biases or nonequilibriumness between the two reservoirs, while for the large tunneling
rate $\mathcal{F}_{\Delta}$ mostly decreases with the degree of nonequilibriumness. This feature
is in agreement with the trend of the entanglement or coherence of this open system. For the local
coupling strength $\Gamma_1$, its QFI $\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma_1}$ increases monotonically in
all cases considered. The universal increasing trend gives an apparent discrepancy for the behaviors
of the entanglements or the coherence in the same nonequilibrium conditions. Our results suggest
that in an open system a large QFI for a local parameter does not necessarily indicate a strong quantum
correlation in the system but instead a strongly nonequilibrium condition in the system.
