Quantum entangled states of light are essential for quantum technologies and fundamental tests
of physics. While quantum information science has relied on systems with entanglement in 2D degrees
of freedom, e.g. quantum bits with polarization states, the field is moving towards ever-higher
dimensions of entanglement. Increasing the dimensionality enhances the channel capacity and
security of quantum communication protocols, gives rise to exponential speed-up of quantum computation,
and is necessary for quantum imaging. Yet, characterization of even bipartite quantum states of
high-dimensional entanglement remains a prohibitively time-consuming challenge, as the dimensionality
of the joint Hilbert space scales quadratically with the number of modes. Here, we develop and experimentally
demonstrate a new, more complete theory of detection in CCD cameras for rapid measurement of the
full joint probability distribution of high-dimensional quantum states. The theory spans the
intensity range from low photon count to saturation of the detector, while the massive parallelization
inherent in the pixel array makes measurements scale favorably with dimensionality. The results
accurately account for partial detection and electronic noise, resolve the paradox of ignoring
two-photon detection in a single pixel despite collinear spatial entanglement, and reveal the
full Hilbert space for exploration. For example, use of a megapixel array allows measurement of
a joint Hilbert space of 1012 dimensions, with a speed-up of nearly four orders of magnitude over
traditional methods. We demonstrate the method with pairs, but it generalizes readily to arbitrary
numbers of entangled photons. The technique uses standard geometry with existing technology,
thus removing barriers of entry to quantum imaging experiments, and open previously inaccessible
regimes of high-dimensional quantum optics.
