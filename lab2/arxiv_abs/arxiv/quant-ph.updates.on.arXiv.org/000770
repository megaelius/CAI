We review the geometry of the space of quantum states $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$ of a finite-level
quantum system with Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ from a group-theoretical point of view. This space
carries two stratifications generated by the action of two different Lie groups: the special unitary
group $\mathcal{SU}(\mathcal{H})$ and its complexification $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$,
the complex special linear group. A stratum of the stratification generated by $\mathcal{SU}(\mathcal{H})$
is composed of isospectral states, that is, density operators with the same spectrum, A stratum
of the stratification generated by $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$ is composed of quantum states
with the same rank. We prove that on every submanifold of isospectral quantum states there is also
a canonical left action of $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$ which is related with the canonical K\"{a}hler
structure on isospectral quantum states. The fundamental vector fields of this $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$-action
are divided into Hamiltonian and gradient vector fields. The former give rise to invertible maps
on $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$ that preserve the von Neumann entropy and the convex structure
of $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$, while the latter give rise to invertible maps on $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$
that preserve the von Neumann entropy but not the convex structure of $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$.
A similar decomposition is given for the $\mathcal{SL}(\mathcal{H})$-action generating the
stratification of $\mathscr{S}(\mathcal{H})$ into manifolds of quantum states with the same
rank, where gradient vector fields preserve the rank but do not preserve entropy. Some comments
on multipartite quantum systems are made. It is proved that the sets of product states of a multipartite
quantum system are homogeneous manifolds for the action of the complex special linear group associated
with the partition.
