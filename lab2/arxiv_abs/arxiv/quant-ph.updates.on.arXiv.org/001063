Periodic driving can be used to coherently control the properties of a many-body state and to realize
new phases which are not accessible in static systems. For example, exposing materials to intense
laser pulses enables to provoke metal-insulator transitions, control the magnetic order and induce
transient superconducting behaviour well above the static transition temperature. However,
pinning down the responsible mechanisms is often difficult, since the response to irradiation
is governed by complex many-body dynamics. In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations
have been performed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, theoretical
analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and new theoretical approaches have
been inspired by the recent observations. Here, we perform an experimental quantum simulation
in a periodically modulated hexagonal lattice and show that anti-ferromagnetic correlations
in a fermionic many-body system can be reduced or enhanced or even switched to ferromagnetic correlations.
We first demonstrate that in the high frequency regime, the description of the many-body system
by an effective Floquet-Hamiltonian with a renormalized tunnelling energy remains valid, by comparing
the results to measurements in an equivalent static lattice. For near-resonant driving, the enhancement
and sign reversal of correlations is explained by a microscopic model, in which the particle tunnelling
and magnetic exchange energies can be controlled independently. In combination with the observed
sufficiently long lifetime of correlations, Floquet engineering thus constitutes an alternative
route to experimentally investigate unconventional pairing in strongly correlated systems.
