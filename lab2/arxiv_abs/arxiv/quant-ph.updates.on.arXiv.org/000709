Instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation refers to a process in which spacelike separated parties
simulate a nonlocal quantum operation on their joint systems through the consumption of pre-shared
entanglement. To prevent a violation of causality, this simulation succeeds up to local errors
that can only be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another. However,
this communication is non-interactive, and it involves just the broadcasting of local measurement
outcomes. We refer to this operational paradigm as local operations and broadcast communication
(LOBC) to distinguish it from the standard local operations and (interactive) classical communication
(LOCC). In this paper, we show that an arbitrary two-quibt gate can be implemented by LOBC with $\epsilon$-error
using $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ entangled bits (ebits). This offers an exponential improvement
over the best known two-qubit protocols, whose ebit costs behave as $O(1/\epsilon)$. We also consider
the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions $d_A\otimes d_B$. We find that any hermitian
gate of this form can be implemented by LOBC using a single shared ebit. In sharp contrast, a lower
bound of $\log d_B$ ebits is shown in the case of generic (i.e. non-hermitian) gates from this family,
even when $d_A=2$. This demonstrates an unbounded entanglement cost between LOCC and LOBC gate
implementation. Furthermore, whereas previous lower bounds on the entanglement cost for instantaneous
nonlocal computation restrict the minimum dimension of the needed entanglement, we bound its entanglement
entropy. To our knowledge this is the first such lower bound of its kind.
