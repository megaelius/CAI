We investigated quantum critical behaviours in the non-equilibrium steady state of a $XXZ$ spin
chain with boundary Markovian noise using the Fisher information. The latter represents the distance
between two infinitesimally close states, and its superextensive size scaling witnesses a critical
behaviour due to a phase transition, since all the interaction terms are extensive. Perturbatively
in the noise strength, we found superextensive Fisher information at anisotropy $|\Delta|\leqslant1$
and irrational $\frac{\arccos\Delta}{\pi}$ irrespective of the order of two non-commuting limits,
i.e. the thermodynamic limit and the limit of sending $\frac{\arccos\Delta}{\pi}$ to an irrational
number via a sequence of rational approximants. From this result we argue the existence of a non-equilibrium
quantum phase transition with a critical phase $|\Delta|\leqslant1$. From the non-superextensivity
of the Fisher information of reduced states, we infer that this non-equilibrium quantum phase transition
does not have local order parameters but has non-local ones, at least at $|\Delta|=1$. In the non-perturbative
regime for the noise strength, we numerically computed the reduced Fisher information which lower
bounds the full state Fisher information, and is superextensive only at $|\Delta|=1$. Form the
latter result, we derived local order parameters at $|\Delta|=1$ in the non-perturbative case.
The existence of critical behaviour witnessed by the Fisher information in the phase $|\Delta|<1$
is still an open problem. The Fisher information also represents the best sensitivity for any estimation
of the control parameter, in our case the anisotropy $\Delta$, and its superextensivity implies
enhanced estimation precision which is also highly robust in the presence of a critical phase.
