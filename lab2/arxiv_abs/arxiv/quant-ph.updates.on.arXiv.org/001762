The diverging responses to parameter variations of systems at quantum critical points motivate
schemes of quantum metrology that feature sub-Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity with the system
size (e.g., the number of particles). This sensitivity enhancement is fundamentally rooted in
the formation of Schroedinger cat states, or macroscopic superposition states at the quantum critical
points. The cat states, however, are fragile to decoherence caused by local noises on individual
particles or coupling to local environments, since the local decoherence of any particle would
cause the collapse of the whole cat state. Therefore, it is unclear whether the sub-Heisenberg scaling
of quantum critical metrology is robust against the local decoherence. Here we study the effects
of local decoherence on the quantum critical metrology, using a one-dimensional transverse-field
Ising model as a representative example. Based on a previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 047201 (2005)]
on the critical behaviors of the noisy Ising model, which shows that the universality class of the
quantum criticality is modified by the decoherence, we find that the standard quantum limit is recovered
by the single-particle decoherence, which is equivalent to local quantum measurement conducted
by the environment and destroys the many-body entanglement in the ground state at the quantum critical
point. Based on a renormalization group analysis, we argue that the noise effects on quantum critical
metrology should be universal. This works demonstrates the importance of protecting macroscopic
quantum coherence for quantum sensing based on critical behaviors.
