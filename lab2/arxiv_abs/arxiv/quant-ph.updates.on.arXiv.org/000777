Randomized benchmarking is an experimental procedure intended to demonstrate control of quantum
systems. The procedure extracts the average error introduced by a set of control operations. When
the target set of operations is intended to be the set of Clifford operators, the randomized benchmarking
algorithm is particularly easy to perform and its results have an important interpretation with
respect to quantum computation. The aim of the benchmark is to provide a simple, useful parameter
describing the quality of quantum control with an experiment that can be performed in a standard
way on any prospective quantum computer. This parameter can be used to fairly compare different
experiments or to mark improvement in a single experiment. In this thesis I discuss first the original
randomized-benchmarking procedure and the importance of the Clifford operators for its implementation.
I develop the statistical analysis of the results and the physical assumptions that are required
for the simplest analysis to apply. The original procedure does not extend in an obvious way to benchmarking
of more than one qubit, so I introduce a standardized procedure for randomized benchmarking that
applies to any number of qubits. This new procedure also enables the benchmarking of an individual
control operation. I describe two randomized-benchmarking experiments I helped to design: one
involved a single qubit and utilized a variation of the original procedure and the second involved
two qubits and demonstrated the new procedure. I conclude with several potential extensions to
the original and new procedures that give them reduced experimental overhead, the ability to describe
encoded operations, and fairer comparisons between experiments.
