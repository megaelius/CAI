Quantum contextuality turns out to be a necessary resource for universal quantum computation and
important in the field of quantum information processing. It is therefore of interest both for theoretical
considerations and for experimental implementation to find new types and instances of contextual
sets and develop methods of their optimal generation. We present an arbitrary exhaustive hypergraph-based
generation of the most explored contextual sets---Kochen-Specker (KS) ones---in 4, 6, 8, 16, and
32 dimensions. We consider and analyse twelve KS classes and obtain numerous properties of theirs,
which we then compare with the results previously obtained in the literature. We generate several
thousand times more types and instances of KS sets than previously known. All KS sets in three of the
classes and in the upper part of a fourth are novel. We make use of the MMP hypergraph language, algorithms,
and programs to generate KS sets strictly following their definition from the Kochen-Specker theorem.
This approach proves to be particularly advantageous over the parity-proof-based ones (which
prevail in the literature), since it turns out that only a very few KS sets have a parity proof (in six
KS classes 0.01% and in one of them 0%). MMP hypergraph formalism enables a translation of an exponentially
complex task of solving systems of nonlinearequations, describing KS vector orthogonalities,
into a statistically linearly complex task of evaluating vertex states of hypergraph edges, thus
exponentially speeding up the generation of KS sets and enabling us to generate billions of novel
instances of them. The MMP hypergraph notation also enables us to graphically represent KS sets
and to visually discern their features.
