It has recently been argued by Aharanov et. al. (2016) that quantum mechanics violates the Pigeon
Counting Principle (PCP), which states that if one distributes three pigeons among two boxes there
must be at least two pigeons in one of the boxes. The article goes on to describe how this phenomenon,
which we call the Quantum Pigeon Conundrum (QPC), can be observed in an experiment using a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer with three weakly coupled electrons. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis
of the QPC and the Mach-Zehnder experiment and new experimental results obtained with the IBM Yorktown
quantum processor. Although these results and previous experiments (Anjusha et. al. 2015, Chen
et. al. 2019) confirm certain predicted amplitudes, we argue that quantum mechanics does not violate
the PCP unless one makes untenable hidden variable assumptions. Simply put, the physical Hilbert
space is spanned by states each having at least two particles in the same box. This leads to the quantum
version of the PCP, an operator identity that, for any realizable quantum state, forbids assigning
values of zero to all three two-particle projection operators. The statement "there are no two particles
in the same box" prior to the projection onto the final state is therefore no more viable than the contention
that each particle in the EPR state has specific values for both position and momentum prior to any
measurement. Our conclusion is that PCP and QPC provide a novel and elegant pedagogical framework
for understanding the (non-)viability of local hidden variables but do not constitute "a new quantum
effect that requires us to revisit some of the most basic notions of quantum physics." as claimed
