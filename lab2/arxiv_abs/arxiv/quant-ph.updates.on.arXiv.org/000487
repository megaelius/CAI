In this work we discuss the dynamical response of heavy quantum impurities immersed in a Fermi gas
at zero and at finite temperature. Studying both the frequency and the time domain allows one to identify
interaction regimes that are characterized by distinct many-body dynamics. From this theoretical
study a picture emerges in which impurity dynamics is universal on essentially all time scales,
and where the high-frequency few-body response is related to the long-time dynamics of the Anderson
orthogonality catastrophe by Tan relations. Our theoretical description relies on different
and complementary approaches: functional determinants give an exact numerical solution for time-
and frequency-resolved responses, bosonization provides analytical expressions at low temperatures,
and the theory of Toeplitz determinants allows one to analytically predict response up to high temperatures.
Using these approaches we predict the thermal decoherence rate and prove that within the considered
model the fastest rate of long-time decoherence is given by $\gamma=\pi k_BT/4$. We show that Feshbach
resonances in cold atomic systems give access to new interaction regimes where quantum effects
prevail even in the thermal regime of many-body dynamics. The key signature of this phenomenon is
a crossover between exponential decay rates of the real-time Ramsey signal. It is shown that the
physics of the orthogonality catastrophe is experimentally observable up to temperatures $T/T_F\lesssim
0.2$ where it leaves its fingerprint in a power-law temperature dependence of thermal spectral
weight and we review how this phenomenon is related to the physics of heavy ions in liquid $^3$He and
the formation of Fermi polarons. The presented results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments
on LiK mixtures, and we predict several phenomena that can be tested using currently available experimental
technology.
