We have recently proposed a new action principle for combining Einstein equations and the Dirac
equation for a point mass. We used a length scale $L_{CS}$, dubbed the Compton-Schwarzschild length,
to which the Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius are small mass and large mass approximations,
respectively. Here we write down the field equations which follow from this action. We argue that
the large mass limit yields Einstein equations, provided we assume wave function collapse and localisation
for large masses. The small mass limit yields the Dirac equation. We explain why the Kerr-Newman
black hole has the same gyromagnetic ratio as the Dirac electron, both being twice the classical
value. The small mass limit also provides compelling reasons for introducing torsion, which is
sourced by the spin density of the Dirac field. There is thus a symmetry between torsion and gravity:
torsion couples to quantum objects through Planck's constant $\hbar$ (but not $G$) and is important
in the microscopic limit. Whereas gravity couples to classical matter, as usual, through Newton's
gravitational constant $G$ (but not $\hbar$), and is important in the macroscopic limit. We construct
the Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations which include the length $L_{CS}$. We find a potentially
significant change in the coupling constant of the torsion driven cubic non-linear self-interaction
term in the Dirac-Hehl-Datta equation. We speculate on the possibility that gravity is not a fundamental
interaction, but emerges as a consequence of wave function collapse, and that the gravitational
constant maybe expressible in terms of Planck's constant and the parameters of dynamical collapse
models.
