The Q-cycle mechanism entering the electron and proton transport chain in oxygenic photosynthesis
is a paradigmatic example of how biological processes can be efficiently investigated with elementary
microscopic models. Here we address the problem of energy transport across the cellular membrane
from an open quantum system theoretical perspective. We model the cytochrome $b_6 f$ protein complex
under cyclic electron flow conditions starting from a simplified kinetic model originally introduced
by Smirnov and Nori. Such formalization is hereby revisited in terms of a quantum master equation
formulation and spin-boson Hamiltonian treatment, which are apt to account for a richer and genuinely
quantum phenomenology. As an original application of our theoretical modeling, we determine the
thermodynamic efficiency and the quantum yield of this complex biochemical process, with no preliminary
assumption besides the choice of well established electrochemical potentials. Albeit not providing
any evidence for an intrinsically quantum coherent dynamics, when scanning the temperature as
an external parameter we determine an optimal thermodynamic efficiency of the Q-cycle around ambient
and physiologically relevant condition. The present work, at the interface between two macro research
areas like Physics and Biology, demonstrates how the theory of quantum open systems can successfully
push forward our theoretical understanding of complex biological systems. Similar approaches
could open new research directions, exploring physical effects that are at the quantum/classical
boundary, with potential applications to both natural and artificially manufactured biological
systems.
