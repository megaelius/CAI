Factoring large integers using a quantum computer is an outstanding research problem that can illustrate
true quantum advantage over classical computers. Exponential time order is required in order to
find the prime factors of an integer by means of classical computation. However, the order can be
drastically reduced by converting the factorization problem to an optimization one and solving
it using a quantum computer. Recent works involving both theoretical and experimental approaches
use Shor's algorithm, adiabatic quantum computation and quantum annealing principles to factorize
integers. However, our work makes use of the generalized Grover's algorithm as proposed by Liu,
with an optimal version of classical algorithm/analytic algebra. We utilize the phase-matching
property of the above algorithm for only amplitude amplification purposes to avoid an inherent
phase factor that prevents perfect implementation of the algorithm. Here we experimentally demonstrate
the factorization of two bi-primes, $4088459$ and $966887$ using IBM's $5$- and $16$-qubit quantum
processors, hence making those the largest numbers that has been factorized on a quantum device.
Using the above $5$-qubit processor, we also realize the factorization of a tri-prime integer $175$,
which had not been achieved to date. We observe good agreement between experimental and theoretical
results with high fidelities. The difficulty of the factorization experiments has been analyzed
and it has been concluded that the solution to this problem depends on the level of simplification
chosen, not the size of the number factored. In principle, our results can be extended to factorize
any multi-prime integer with minimum quantum resources.
