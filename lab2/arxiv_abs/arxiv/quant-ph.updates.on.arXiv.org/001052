The reaction-coordinate mapping is a useful technique to study complex quantum dissipative dynamics
into structured environments. In essence, it aims to mimic the original problem by means of an 'augmented
system', which includes a suitably chosen collective environmental coordinate---the 'reaction
coordinate'. This composite then couples to a simpler 'residual reservoir' with short-lived correlations.
If, in addition, the residual coupling is weak, a simple quantum master equation can be rigorously
applied to the augmented system, and the solution of the original problem just follows from tracing
out the reaction coordinate. But, what if the residual dissipation is strong? Here we consider an
exactly solvable model for heat transport---a two-node linear "quantum wire" connecting two baths
at different temperatures. We allow for a structured spectral density at the interface with one
of the reservoirs and perform the reaction-coordinate mapping, writing a perturbative master
equation for the augmented system. We find that: (a) strikingly, the stationary state of the original
problem can be reproduced accurately by a weak-coupling treatment even when the residual dissipation
on the augmented system is very strong; (b) the agreement holds throughout the entire dynamics under
large residual dissipation in the overdamped regime; (c) and that such master equation can grossly
overestimate the stationary heat current across the wire, even when its non-equilibrium steady
state is captured faithfully. These observations can be crucial when using the reaction-coordinate
mapping to study the largely unexplored strong-coupling regime in quantum thermodynamics.
