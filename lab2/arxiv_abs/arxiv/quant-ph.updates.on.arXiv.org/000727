The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an attracting possible application of near-term
quantum computers. Originally, the aim of the VQE is to find a ground state for a given specific Hamiltonian.
It is achieved by minimizing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to an ansatz state
by tuning parameters \(\bm{\theta}\) on a quantum circuit which constructs the ansatz. Here we
consider an extended problem of the VQE, namely, our objective in this work is to "generalize" the
optimized output of the VQE just like machine learning. We aim to find ground states for a given set
of Hamiltonians \(\{H(\bm{x})\}\), where \(\bm{x}\) is a parameter which specifies the quantum
system under consideration, such as geometries of atoms of a molecule. Our approach is to train the
circuit on the small number of \(\bm{x}\)'s. Specifically, we employ the interpolation of the optimal
circuit parameter determined at different \(\bm{x}\)'s, assuming that the circuit parameter
\(\bm{\theta}\) has simple dependency on a hidden parameter \(\bm{x}\) as \(\bm{\theta}(\bm{x})\).
We show by numerical simulations that, using an ansatz which we call the Hamiltonian-alternating
ansatz, the optimal circuit parameters can be interpolated to give near-optimal ground states
in between the trained \(\bm{x}\)'s. The proposed method can greatly reduce, on a rough estimation
by a few orders of magnitude, the time required to obtain ground states for different Hamiltonians
by the VQE. Once generalized, the ansatz circuit can predict the ground state without optimizing
the circuit parameter \(\bm{\theta}\) in a certain range of \(\bm{x}\).
