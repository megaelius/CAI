Non-Hermitian properties of open quantum systems and their applications have attracted much attention
in recent years. While most of the studies focus on the characteristic nature of non-Hermitian systems,
one important point has been overlooked: A non-Hermitian system can be a subsystem of a Hermitian
system as one can clearly see in Feshbach projective operator (FPO) formalism. In this case, the
orthogonality of the eigenvectors of the total (Hermitian) system must be sustained, despite the
eigenvectors of the subsystem (non-Hermitian) satisfy the bi-orthogonal condition. Therefore,
one can predict that there must exist some remarkable processes that relate the non-Hermitian subsystem
and the rest part, and ultimately preserve the Hermiticity of the total system. In this paper, we
study such processes in open elliptical microcavities. The inner part of the cavity is a non-Hermitian
system, and the outer part is the coupled bath in FPO formalism. We investigate the correlation between
the inner- and the outer-part behaviors associated with the avoided resonance crossings (ARCs),
and analyze the results in terms of the Lamb shift. The ARC structures we examined depend on a trade-off
between the relative difference of self-energies (simply known as Lamb shifts in atomic physics)
and collective Lamb shifts. While the collective Lamb shift is maximized in the region of the center
of ARC, but the relative difference of self-energies is minimized, and this naturally induce a crossing
of imaginary part of eigenvalues. These results come from the conservation of the orthogonality
in the total Hermitian quantum system.
