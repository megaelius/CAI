BB84 protocol has shown the possibility of quantum key distribution. A framework for optimal eavesdropping
on this protocol was first established by Fuchs et. al. (Phys. Rev. A, 1997). They explicitly specified
an instance of the state of an eavesdroppers' probe after an interaction is done optimally with the
polarized photon from a sender. Upon a proper measurement it helps achieve maximum knowledge regarding
the state of the qubit prepared by the sender while not exceeding the error rate tolerable by the receiver.
A step ahead, Acharyya et. al. (Phys. Rev. A 2017) derived infinitely many such states of the probe
resulting from optimal interactions. However, none of the existing work on optimal eavesdropping
focus on characterizing the initial state of the probe and the unitary evolution that an eavesdropper
needs to use in order to achieve the desired post-interaction states yielding maximum information
gain. In this paper we address this open problem: we provide explicit specification of these pairs
(infinitely many) each of which ensures optimal eavesdropping. % A general framework of optimal
eavesdropping on BB84 protocol was provided by Fuchs et. al. (Phys. Rev. A, 1997). An upper bound
on mutual information was % derived, which could be achieved by a specific type of interaction and
the corresponding measurement. However, uniqueness of optimal interaction was posed as an unsolved
problem there and it has remained open for almost two decades now. In this paper, we solve this open
problem and establish the uniqueness of optimal interaction up to rotation. The specific choice
of optimal interaction by Fuchs et. al.. is shown to be a special case of the form derived in our work.
