In order to perform universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, one needs to implement a logical
non-Clifford gate. Consequently, it is important to understand codes that implement such gates
transversally. In this paper, we adopt an algebraic approach to characterize all stabilizer codes
for which transversal $T$ and $T^{-1}$ gates preserve the codespace. Our Heisenberg perspective
reduces this to a finite geometry problem that translates to the design of certain classical codes.
We prove three corollaries: (a) For any non-degenerate $[[ n,k,d ]]$ stabilizer code supporting
a physical transversal $T$, there exists an $[[ n,k,d ]]$ CSS code with the same property; (b) Triorthogonal
codes are the most general CSS codes that realize logical transversal $T$ via physical transversal
$T$; (c) Triorthogonality is necessary for physical transversal $T$ on a CSS code to realize the
logical identity. The main tool we use is a recent efficient characterization of certain diagonal
gates in the Clifford hierarchy (arXiv:1902.04022). We refer to these gates as Quadratic Form Diagonal
(QFD) gates. Our framework generalizes all existing code constructions that realize logical gates
via transversal $T$. We provide several examples and briefly discuss connections to decreasing
monomial codes, pin codes, generalized triorthogonality and quasitransversality. We partially
extend these results towards characterizing all stabilizer codes that support transversal $\pi/2^{\ell}$
$Z$-rotations. In particular, using Ax's theorem on residue weights of polynomials, we provide
an alternate characterization of logical gates induced by transversal $\pi/2^{\ell}$ $Z$-rotations
on a family of quantum Reed-Muller codes. We also briefly discuss a general approach to analyze QFD
gates that might lead to a characterization of all stabilizer codes that support any given physical
transversal $1$- or $2$-local diagonal gate.
