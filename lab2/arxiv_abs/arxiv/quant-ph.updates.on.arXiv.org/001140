In this thesis we focus on the influence of uniform acceleration on quantum states and their properties,
as well as on quantum entanglement contained in the vacuum. First, we analyze a quantum clock measuring
time in terms of the decay of an unstable particle. We compare the rate of ticking of a stationary clock
to the one of a uniformly accelerating clock. We discover that there exists a deviation from what
the discrepancy between those rates is predicted to be by special relativity. In a further part of
this thesis we focus on the family of two-mode Gaussian states of two localized modes of a given quantum
field. A general framework is developed for investigating the properties of such states, when observed
by two uniformly accelerated observers, having access to another pair of localized modes. In particular,
we focus on the vacuum state and examine the amount of quantum entanglement perceived by the observers.
The framework is developed for three cases: the quantum scalar field in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions and
the Dirac spinor field in 1+1 dimensions. We find that in general more entanglement is seen when the
accelerations of the observers increase and when the size of the modes of the observers and their
central frequencies decrease. Furthermore, we extend our attention also to tripartite entanglement
and investigate its extraction from the quantum vacuum by three particle detectors in a cavity,
interacting with a quantum field for a finite time. Detailed maps of amounts of tripartite and bipartite
entanglement extracted by the detectors, are produced and compared between two types of boundary
conditions. It is found vacuum entanglement is most easily extracted in the case of periodic boundary
conditions and it is easier to extract tripartite than bipartite entanglement.
