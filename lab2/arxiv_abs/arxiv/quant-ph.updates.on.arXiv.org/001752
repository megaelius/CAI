Quantum variational algorithms are one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum
computers; however, recent studies have demonstrated that unless the variational quantum circuits
are configured in a problem-specific manner, optimization of such circuits will most likely fail.
In this paper, we focus on a special family of quantum circuits called the Hamiltonian Variational
Ansatz (HVA), which takes inspiration from the quantum approximation optimization algorithm
and adiabatic quantum computation. Through the study of its entanglement spectrum and energy gradient
statistics, we find that HVA exhibits favorable structural properties such as mild or entirely
absent barren plateaus and a restricted state space that eases their optimization in comparison
to the well-studied "hardware-efficient ansatz." We also numerically observe that the optimization
landscape of HVA becomes almost trap free when the ansatz is over-parameterized. We observe a size-dependent
"computational phase transition" as the number of layers in the HVA circuit is increased where the
optimization crosses over from a hard to an easy region in terms of the quality of the approximations
and speed of convergence to a good solution. In contrast with the analogous transitions observed
in the learning of random unitaries which occur at a number of layers that grows exponentially with
the number of qubits, our Variational Quantum Eigensolver experiments suggest that the threshold
to achieve the over-parameterization phenomenon scales at most polynomially in the number of qubits
for the transverse field Ising and XXZ models. Lastly, as a demonstration of its entangling power
and effectiveness, we show that HVA can find accurate approximations to the ground states of a modified
Haldane-Shastry Hamiltonian on a ring, which has long-range interactions and has a power-law entanglement
scaling.
