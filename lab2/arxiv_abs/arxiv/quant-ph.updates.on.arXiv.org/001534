This thesis focuses on the mathematical description and application of nonlinear cavity optomechanical
systems. The first part is concerned with solving the dynamics of the standard nonlinear optomechanical
Hamiltonian with an additional time-dependent mechanical displacement and single-mode squeezing
term. The solution is based on identifying a Lie algebra that generates the time-evolution of the
system, which reduces the problem to considering a finite set of coupled ordinary differential
equations of real functions. The second part applies the solutions of the extended optomechanical
Hamiltonian to the study of non-Gaussianity. We compute the non-Gaussian character of an optomechanical
state as a function of the parameters in the Hamiltonian, and investigate the interplay between
the non-Gaussianity, the strength of the nonlinear coupling and the strength of the single-mode
mechanical squeezing term. We find that the strength and form of the nonlinear coupling strongly
impacts the non-Gaussianity, and that its relationship with the squeezing term is highly complex.
The third part concerns the use of nonlinear optomechanical systems as quantum sensors. We derive
a general expression of the quantum Fisher information given the extended optomechanical Hamiltonian
and demonstrate its applicability through three concrete examples: estimating the strength of
a nonlinear light--matter coupling, the strength of a time-modulated mechanical displacement,
and the strength of a single-mode mechanical squeezing parameter, all of which are modulated at
resonance. In the last Chapter of the thesis, we consider the estimation of a constant gravitational
acceleration with an optomechanical system. Our results suggest that optomechanical systems
could, in principle, be used as powerful quantum sensors.
