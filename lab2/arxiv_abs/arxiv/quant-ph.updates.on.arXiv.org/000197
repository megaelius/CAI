We describe a simple and consistent quantum mathematical model that simulates the possible role
of quantum interference and sink effects in the nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in light-harvesting
complexes (LHCs). Our model consists of a network of five interconnected sites (excitonic states)
responsible for the NPQ mechanism: (i) Two excited states of chlorophyll molecules, $ChlA^*$ and
$ChlB^*$, forming an LHC dimer, which is initially populated; (ii) A "damaging" site which is responsible
for production of singlet oxygen and other destructive outcomes; (iii) The $(ChlA-Zea)^*$ heterodimer
excited state (Zea indicates zeaxanthin); and (iv) The charge transfer state of this heterodimer,
$(ChlA^{-}-Zea^{+})^*$. In our model, both damaging and charge transfer states are described
by discrete electron energy levels attached to their sinks, that mimic the continuum part of electron
energy spectrum, as at these sites the electron participates in quasi-irreversible chemical reactions.
All five excitonic sites interact with the protein environment that is modeled using a stochastic
approach. As an example, we apply our model to demonstrate possible contributions of quantum interference
and sink effects in the NPQ mechanism in the CP29 minor LHC. Our numerical results on the quantum dynamics
of the reduced density matrix, demonstrate a possible way to significantly suppress, under some
conditions, the damaging channel using quantum interference effects and sinks. The results demonstrate
the possible role of interference and sink effects for modeling, engineering, and optimizing the
performance of the NPQ processes in both natural and artificial light-harvesting complexes.
