Causal systems describe the localizability of relativistic quantum systems complying with the
principles of special relativity and elementary causality. At their classification we restrict
ourselves to real mass and finite spinor systems. It follows that (up to certain not yet discarded
unitarily related systems) the only irreducible causal systems are the Dirac and the Weyl fermions.
Their wave-equations are established as a mere consequence of causal localization. The compact
localized Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are studied in detail. One finds that, at the speed of light,
the carriers shrink in the past and expand in the future. For every direction in space there is a defnite
time at which the change from shrinking to expanding occurs. A late changing time characterizes
those states, which shrink to a delta-strip if boosted in the opposite direction. Using a density
result for these late-change states one shows that all Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are subjected
to Lorentz contraction. We tackle the question whether a causal system induces a representation
of a causal logic and thus provides a localization in proper space-time regions rather than on spacelike
hyperplanes. The causal logic generated by the spacelike relation is shown to do not admit representations
at all. But the logic generated by the non-timelike relation in general does, and the necessary condition
is derived that there is a projection valued measure on every non-timelike non-spacelike hyperplane
being the high boost limit of the localization on the spacelike hyperplanes. Dirac and Weyl systems
are shown to satisfy this condition and thus to extend to all non-timelike hyperplanes, which implies
more profound properties of the causal systems. The compact localized eigenstates of the projections
to non-spacelike flat strips are late-change states.
