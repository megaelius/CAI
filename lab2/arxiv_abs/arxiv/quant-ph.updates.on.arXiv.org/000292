In this work, we analyse and model a real life financial loan application belonging to a sample bank
in the Netherlands. The log is robust in terms of data, containing a total of 262 200 event logs, belonging
to 13 087 different credit applications. The dataset is heterogeneous and consists of a mixture
of computer generated automatic processes and manual human tasks. The goal is to work out a decision
model, which represents the underlying tasks that make up the loan application service, and to assess
potential areas of improvement of the institution's internal processes. To this end we study the
impact of incomplete event logs for the extraction and analysis of business processes. It is quite
common that event logs are incomplete with several amounts of missing information (for instance,
workers forget to register their tasks). Absence of data is translated into a drastic decrease of
precision and compromises the decision models, leading to biased and unrepresentative results.
We investigate how classical probabilistic models are affected by incomplete event logs and we
explore quantum-like probabilistic inferences as an alternative mathematical model to classical
probability. This work represents a first step towards systematic investigation of the impact
of quantum interference in a real life large scale decision scenario. The results obtained in this
study indicate that, under high levels of uncertainty, the quantum-like models generate quantum
interference terms, which allow an additional non-linear parameterisation of the data. Experimental
results attest the efficiency of the quantum-like Bayesian networks, since the application of
interference terms is able to reduce the error percentage of inferences performed over quantum-like
models when compared to inferences produced by classical models.
