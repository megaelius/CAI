As research on building scalable quantum computers advances, it is important to be able to certify
their correctness. Due to the exponential hardness of classically simulating quantum computation,
straight-forward verification via this means fails. However, we can classically simulate small
scale quantum computations and hence we are able to test that devices behave as expected in this domain.
This constitutes the first step towards obtaining confidence in the anticipated quantum-advantage
when we extend to scales that can no longer be simulated. Real devices have restrictions due to their
architecture and limitations due to physical imperfections and noise. In this paper we extend the
usual ideal simulations by considering those effects. We provide a general methodology and framework
for constructing simulations which emulate the physical system. These simulations should provide
a benchmark for realistic devices and guide experimental research in the quest for quantum-advantage.
To illustrate our methodology we give examples that involve networked architectures and the noise-model
of the device developed by the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT). For our simulations
we use, with suitable modification, the classical simulator of Bravyi and Gosset while the specific
problems considered belong to the Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time class. This class is
believed to be hard for classical computational devices, and is regarded as a promising candidate
for the first demonstration of quantum-advantage. We first consider a subclass of IQP, defined
by Bermejo-Vega et al, involving two-dimensional dynamical quantum simulators, and then general
instances of IQP, restricted to the architecture of NQIT.
