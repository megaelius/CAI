It is useful to have a criterion for when the predictions of an operational theory should be considered
classically explainable. Here we take the criterion to be that the theory admits of a generalized-noncontextual
ontological model. Existing works on generalized noncontextuality have focused on experimental
scenarios having a simple structure, typically, prepare-measure scenarios. Here, we formally
extend the framework of ontological models as well as the principle of generalized noncontextuality
to arbitrary compositional scenarios. We leverage this process-theoretic framework to prove
that, under some reasonable assumptions, every generalized-noncontextual ontological model
of a tomographically local operational theory has a surprisingly rigid and simple mathematical
structure; in short, it corresponds to a frame representation which is not overcomplete. One consequence
of this theorem is that the largest number of ontic states possible in any such model is given by the
dimension of the associated generalized probabilistic theory. This constraint is useful for generating
noncontextuality no-go theorems as well as techniques for experimentally certifying contextuality.
Along the way, we extend known results concerning the equivalence of different notions of classicality
from prepare-measure scenarios to arbitrary compositional scenarios. Specifically, we prove
a correspondence between the following three notions of classical explainability of an operational
theory: (i) admitting a noncontextual ontological model, (ii) admitting of a positive quasiprobability
representation, and (iii) being simplex-embeddable.
