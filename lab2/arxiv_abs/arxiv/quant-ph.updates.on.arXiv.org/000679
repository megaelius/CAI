We discuss the partitioning of a quantum system by subsystem separation through unitary block-diagonalization
(SSUB) applied to a Fock operator. Our separation can be formulated in a very general way. It can be
applied to very different partitionings ranging from those driven by features in the molecular
structure (such as a solute surrounded by solvent molecules) to those that aim at an orbital separation
(such as core-valence separation). Our framework embraces recent developments of Manby and Miller
as well as older ones of Huzinaga and Cantu. Projector-based embedding is simplified and accelerated
by SSUB. Moreover, it directly relates to decoupling approaches for relativistic four-component
many-electron theory. For a Fock operator based on the Dirac one-electron Hamiltonian, one would
like to separate the so-called positronic (negative-energy) states from the electronic bound
and continuum states. The exact two-component (X2C) approach developed for this purpose becomes
a special case of the general SSUB framework and may therefore be viewed as a system-environment
decoupling approach. Moreover, for SSUB there exists no restriction with respect to the number
of subsystems that are generated - in the limit, decoupling of all single-particle states is recovered,
which represents exact diagonalization of the problem. The fact that a Fock operator depends on
its eigenvectors poses challenges to all system-environment decoupling approaches and is discussed
in terms of the SSUB framework. Apart from improved conceptual understanding, these relations
bring about technical advances as developments in different fields can immediately cross-fertilize
one another. As an important example we discuss the atomic decomposition of the unitary block-diagonalization
matrix in X2C-type approaches that can inspire approaches for the efficient partitioning of large
total systems based on SSUB.
