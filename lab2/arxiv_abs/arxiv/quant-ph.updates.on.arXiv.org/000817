The strong-coupling regime of cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (cQED) represents light-matter
interaction at the fully quantum level. Adding a single photon shifts the resonance frequencies,
a profound nonlinearity. cQED is a test-bed of quantum optics and the basis of photon-photon and
atom-atom entangling gates. At microwave frequencies, success in cQED has had a transformative
effect. At optical frequencies, the gates are potentially much faster and the photons can propagate
over long distances and be easily detected, ideal features for quantum networks. Following pioneering
work on single atoms, solid-state implementations are important for developing practicable quantum
technology. Here, we embed a semiconductor quantum dot in a microcavity. The microcavity has a $\mathcal{Q}$-factor
close to $10^{6}$ and contains a charge-tunable quantum dot with close-to-transform-limited
optical linewidth. The exciton-photon coupling rate $g$ exceeds both the photon decay rate $\kappa$
and exciton decay rate $\gamma$ by a large margin ($g/\gamma=14$, $g/\kappa=5.3$); the cooperativity
is $C=2g^{2}/(\gamma \kappa)=150$, the $\beta$-factor 99.7%. We observe pronounced vacuum Rabi
oscillations in the time-domain, photon blockade at a one-photon resonance, and highly bunched
photon statistics at a two-photon resonance. We use the change in photon statistics as a sensitive
spectral probe of transitions between the first and second rungs of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder.
All experiments can be described quantitatively with the Jaynes-Cummings model despite the complexity
of the solid-state environment. We propose this system as a platform to develop optical-cQED for
quantum technology, for instance a photon-photon entangling gate.
