Capacities of quantum channels and decoherence times both quantify the extent to which quantum
information can withstand degradation by interactions with its environment. However, calculating
capacities directly is known to be very hard. Much recent work has focused on upper bounding certain
capacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from operator theory. In
the mean time, there has also been substantial recent progress on estimating decoherence times
with techniques from analysis and geometry, even though many hard questions remain open. In this
article, we introduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called \emph{transferred
channels}, which are built through representation theory from a classical Markov kernel defined
on a compact group. In particular, we study two subclasses of such kernels: H\"ormander systems
on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on finite groups. Examples of transferred channels include
the depolarizing channel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting
on d qubits. We then extend tools developed in earlier work by Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer
estimates of the classical Markov kernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different
non-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article is the application
of these functional inequalities to the estimation of decoherence time, of private and quantum
capacities, of entanglement-assisted classical capacities as well as estimation of entanglement
breaking times, defined as the first time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking.
Moreover, our estimates also hold for non-ergodic channels such as the collective decoherence
channels, an important scenario which has been overlooked so far because of a lack of techniques.
