Verifying quantum states is central to certifying the correct operation of various quantum information
processing tasks. In particular, in measurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct
graph states are generated or not is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification
protocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are particularly resource efficient:
Many copies are required in order to extract a single state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal
graph state. For example, the best protocol currently known requires $O(n^{15})$ copies of the
state, where $n$ is the size of the graph state [D. Markham et al., arXiv:1801.05057 (2018)]. In this
paper, we construct a significantly more resource-efficient verification protocol for graph
states that needs only $O(n^5 \log{n})$ copies. The key idea that achieves such a drastic improvement
is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a probability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing
Serfling's bound also enables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable
graph states. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for qudit and continuous-variable
graph states is nontrivial. For example, previous verification protocols for qubit graph states
that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit and continuous-variable
graph states without hugely increasing the resource overhead. This is because the overhead caused
by the quantum de Finetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our protocol,
the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and therefore generalizing to qudit
or continuous-variable graph states does not increase the overhead. The flexibility of Serfling's
bound also makes our protocol robust: It accepts slightly noisy but still useful graph states, which
are rejected by previous protocols.
