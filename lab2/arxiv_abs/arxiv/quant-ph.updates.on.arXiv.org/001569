A standard approach to quantifying resources is to determine which operations on the resources
are freely available and to deduce the ordering relation among the resources that these operations
induce. If the resource of interest is the nonclassicality of the correlations embodied in a quantum
state, that is, entanglement, then it is typically presumed that the appropriate choice of free
operations is local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We here argue that, in spite
of the near-universal endorsement of the LOCC paradigm by the quantum information community, this
is the wrong choice for one of the most prominent applications of entanglement theory, namely, the
study of Bell scenarios. The nonclassicality of correlations in such scenarios, we argue, should
be quantified instead by local operations and shared randomness (LOSR). We support this thesis
by showing that various perverse features of the interplay between entanglement and nonlocality
are merely an artifact of the use of LOCC-entanglement and that the interplay between LOSR-entanglement
and nonlocality is natural and intuitive. Specifically, we show that the LOSR paradigm (i) provides
a resolution of the "anomaly of nonlocality", wherein partially entangled states exhibit more
nonlocality than maximally entangled states, (ii) entails a notion of genuine multipartite entanglement
that is distinct from the conventional one and which is free of several of its pathological features,
and (iii) makes possible a resource-theoretic account of the self-testing of entangled states
which simplifies and generalizes prior results. Along the way, we derive some fundamental results
concerning the necessary and sufficient conditions for convertibility between pure entangled
states under LOSR and highlight some of their consequences, such as the impossibility of catalysis
for bipartite pure states.
