Parallel Lives (PL) is an ontological model of nature in which quantum mechanics and special relativity
are unified in a single universe with a single Minkowski space-time. Point-like objects called
\emph{lives} are the only fundamental objects in this space-time, and they propagate at or below
$c$, and interact with one another only locally at point-like events in space-time --- not unlike
relativistic billiard balls. Lives are the only causal agents in the universe, and thus the causal
structure of interaction events in space-time is Lorentz invariant. Each life traces a continuous
world-line through space-time, and each life experiences its own \emph{relative world}, fully
defined by the past events along its world-line. A quantum field comprises a continuum of lives throughout
space-time, and excitations like particles are the familiar physical systems in the universe ---
each comprising its own sub-continuum of lives. A pure universal quantum wavefunction tracks the
collective behavior of these lives, but not their individual dynamics. There is a preferred separable
basis for the Hilbert space of the universal wavefunction, and for a given physical system, each
orthogonal term in this basis is a different relative world --- each containing some fraction of
the lives of the system. Hidden information about entanglement correlations in the universal wavefunction
is shared locally by lives at all interaction events and carried as they propagate. This hidden information
governs which lives of different systems will meet during future interactions, and enforces entanglement
correlations between the lives of the systems. All entanglement correlations --- including Bell
violations --- are enforced by this local mechanism. These, and many other details, are explored
here, but several aspects of this framework are not yet fleshed out, and work is ongoing.
