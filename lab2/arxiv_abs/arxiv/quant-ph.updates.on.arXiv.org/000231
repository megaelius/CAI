According to the world view of macrorealism, the properties of a given system exist prior to and independent
of measurement, which is incompatible with quantum mechanics. Leggett and Garg put forward a practical
criterion capable of identifying violations of macrorealism, and so far experiments performed
on microscopic and mesoscopic systems have always ruled out in favor of quantum mechanics. However,
a macrorealist can always assign the cause of such violations to the perturbation that measurements
effect on such small systems, and hence a definitive test would require using non-invasive measurements,
preferably on macroscopic objects, where such measurements seem more plausible. However, the
generation of truly macroscopic quantum superposition states capable of violating macrorealism
remains a big challenge. In this work we propose a setup that makes use of measurements on the polarization
of light, a property which has been extensively manipulated both in classical and quantum contexts,
hence establishing the perfect link between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. In particular,
we use Leggett-Garg inequalities and the criterion of no-signaling in time to study the macrorealistic
character of light polarization for different kinds of measurements, in particular with different
degrees of coarse-graining. Our proposal is non-invasive for coherent input states by construction.
We show for states with well defined photon number in two orthogonal polarization modes, that there
always exists a way of making the measurement sufficiently coarse-grained so that a violation of
macrorealism becomes arbitrarily small, while sufficiently sharp measurements can always lead
to a significant violation.
