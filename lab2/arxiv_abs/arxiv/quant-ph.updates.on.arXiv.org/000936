Starting from a state of low quantum entanglement, local unitary time evolution increases the entanglement
of a quantum many-body system. In contrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees
of freedom and decrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by considering
time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We begin by constructing a toy model
of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that measurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e.
area law) entanglement, in contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary
time evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement for any measurement
rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show that more generic models of entanglement
can feature an area-to-volume law transition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement
with recent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we analytically investigate
Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit an entanglement transition. We are able to
identify stabilizer size distributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed
points.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on the order of limits
- one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any non-zero measurement rate, whereas a different
order of limits allows for an area law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument
that a system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law entanglement entropy
if it also features a subleading correction term, which provides a universal signature of projective
dynamics in the high-entanglement phase. Note: The results presented here supersede those of all
previous versions of this manuscript, which contained some erroneous claims.
