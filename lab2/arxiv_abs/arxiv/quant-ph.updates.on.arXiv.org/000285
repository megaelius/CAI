Thermodynamics of quantum coherence has attracted growing attention recently, where the thermodynamic
advantage of quantum superposition is characterized in terms of quantum thermodynamics. We investigate
thermodynamic effects of quantum coherent driving in the context of the fluctuation theorem. We
adopt a quantum-trajectory approach to investigate open quantum systems under feedback control.
In these systems, the measurement backaction in the forward process plays a key role, and therefore
the corresponding time-reversed quantum measurement and post-selection must be considered in
the backward process in sharp contrast to the classical case. The state reduction associated with
quantum measurement, in general, creates a zero-probability region in the space of quantum trajectories
of the forward process, which causes singularly strong irreversibility with divergent entropy
production (i.e., absolute irreversibility) and hence makes the ordinary fluctuation theorem
break down. In the classical case, the error-free measurement ordinarily leads to absolute irreversibility
because the measurement restricts classical paths to the region compatible with the measurement
outcome. In contrast, in open quantum systems, absolute irreversibility is suppressed even in
the presence of the projective measurement due to those quantum rare events that go through the classically
forbidden region with the aid of quantum coherent driving. This suppression of absolute irreversibility
exemplifies the thermodynamic advantage of quantum coherent driving. Absolute irreversibility
is shown to emerge in the absence of coherent driving after the measurement, especially in systems
under time-delayed feedback control. We show that absolute irreversibility is mitigated by increasing
the duration of quantum coherent driving or decreasing the delay time of feedback control.
