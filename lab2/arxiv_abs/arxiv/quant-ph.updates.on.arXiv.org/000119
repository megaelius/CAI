Path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics defines the amplitude, or wavefunction, as a sum
of the phase-factors over trajectories in a base manifold, which is taken here to be a general Riemannian
space with trajectories parameterized by their arclengths. Generalized Klein-Gordon equation,
deducible from the path-integral representation, provides the quantum mechanical description
of a particle. Phase-factors are periodic functions of the classical action. Periodicity of the
phase-factors with respect to action is shown in this article to impart corresponding periodicity
to one parameter family of amplitudes generated by the translations of arclength. The translation
parameter is also identified with arclength that can be adjoined to the base space to obtain an extended
manifold, which is endowed with a Riemannian structure induced in it by trajectories in the base.
Further, periodicity of the family of amplitudes with respect to the translation parameter together
with the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are used to develop a quantized field formulation
in the extended manifold of a collection of particles defined by the original particle. The extended
manifold can replace the base in this treatment and thus, the program continues for higher dimensional
manifolds generated in the process. Results are illustrated with the example of the base being the
3D Euclidean space, yielding the classical and quantum descriptions of a photon and its quantized
field description with zero vacuum energy in the extended manifold, which with arclength identified
with time results in the Minkowski spacetime. Parallel formulation for a massive particle is described
briefly.
