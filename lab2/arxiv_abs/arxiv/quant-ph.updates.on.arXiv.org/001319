Quantum hydrodynamics is a formulation of quantum mechanics based on the probability density and
flux (current) density of a quantum system. It can be used to define trajectories which allow for
a particle-based interpretation of quantum mechanics, commonly known as Bohmian mechanics. However,
quantum hydrodynamics rests on the usual time-dependent formulation of quantum mechanics where
time appears as a parameter. This parameter describes the correlation of the state of the quantum
system with an external system -- a clock -- which behaves according to classical mechanics. With
the Exact Factorization of a quantum system into a marginal and a conditional system, quantum mechanics
and hence quantum hydrodynamics can be generalized for quantum clocks. In this article, the theory
is developed and it is shown that trajectories for the quantum system can still be defined, and that
these trajectories depend conditionally on the trajectory of the clock. Such trajectories are
not only interesting from a fundamental point of view, but they can also find practical applications
whenever a dynamics relative to an external time parameter is composed of "fast" and "slow" degrees
of freedom and the interest is in the fast ones, while quantum effects of the slow ones (like a branching
of the wavepacket) cannot be neglected. As an illustration, time- and clock-dependent trajectories
are calculated for a model system of a non-adiabatic dynamics, where an electron is the quantum system,
a nucleus is the quantum clock, and an external time parameter is provided, e.g. via an interaction
with a laser field that is not treated explicitly.
