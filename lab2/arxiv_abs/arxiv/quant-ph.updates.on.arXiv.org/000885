In this paper we outline the extension of recently introduced the sub-system embedding sub-algebras
coupled cluster (SES-CC) formalism to the unitary CC formalism. In analogy to the standard single-reference
SES-CC formalism, its unitary CC extension allows one to include the dynamical (outside the active
space) correlation effects in an SES induced complete active space (CAS) effective Hamiltonian.
In contrast to the standard single-reference SES-CC theory, the unitary CC approach results in
a Hermitian form of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, for the double unitary CC formalis
(DUCC) the corresponding CAS eigenvalue problem provides a rigorous separation of external cluster
amplitudes that describe dynamical correlation effects - used to define the effective Hamiltonian
- from those corresponding to the internal (inside the active space) excitations that define the
components of eigenvectors associated with the energy of the entire system. The proposed formalism
can be viewed as an efficient way of downfolding many-electron Hamiltonian to the low-energy model
represented by a particular choice of CAS. In principle, this technique can be extended to any type
of complete active space representing an arbitrary energy window of a quantum system. The Hermitian
character of low-dimensional effective Hamiltonians makes them an ideal target for several types
of full configuration interaction (FCI) type eigensolvers. As an example, we also discuss the algebraic
form of the perturbative expansions of the effective DUCC Hamiltonians corresponding to composite
unitary CC theories and discuss possible algorithms for hybrid classical and quantum computing.
