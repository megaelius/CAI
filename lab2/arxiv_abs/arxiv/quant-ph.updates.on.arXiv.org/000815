The range of a quantum measurement is the set of output probability distributions that can be produced
by varying the input state. We introduce data-driven inference as a protocol that, given a set of
experimental data as a collection of output distributions, infers the quantum measurement which
is, i) consistent with the data, in the sense that its range contains all the distributions observed,
and, ii) maximally noncommittal, in the sense that its range is of minimum volume in the space of output
distributions. We show that data-driven inference is able to return a measurement up to symmetries
of the state space (as it is solely based on observed distributions) and that such limit accuracy
is achieved for any data set if and only if the inference adopts a (hyper)-spherical state space (for
example, the classical or the quantum bit). When using data-driven inference as a protocol to reconstruct
an unknown quantum measurement, we show that a crucial property to consider is that of observational
completeness, which is defined, in analogy to the property of informational completeness in quantum
tomography, as the property of any set of states that, when fed into any given measurement, produces
a set of output distributions allowing for the correct reconstruction of the measurement via data-driven
inference. We show that observational completeness is strictly stronger than informational completeness,
in the sense that not all informationally complete sets are also observationally complete. Moreover,
we show that for systems with a (hyper)-spherical state space, the only observationally complete
simplex is the regular one, namely, the symmetric informationally complete set.
