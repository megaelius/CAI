A spin-$j$ state can be represented by a symmetric tensor of order $N=2j$ and dimension $4$. Here,
$j$ can be a positive integer, which corresponds to a boson; $j$ can also be a positive half-integer,
which corresponds to a fermion. In this paper, we introduce regularly decomposable tensors and
show that a spin-$j$ state is classical if and only if its representing tensor is a regularly decomposable
tensor. In the even-order case, a regularly decomposable tensor is a completely decomposable tensor
but not vice versa; a completely decomposable tensors is a sum-of-squares (SOS) tensor but not vice
versa; an SOS tensor is a positive semi-definite (PSD) tensor but not vice versa. In the odd-order
case, the first row tensor of a regularly decomposable tensor is regularly decomposable and its
other row tensors are induced by the regular decomposition of its first row tensor. We also show that
complete decomposability and regular decomposability are invariant under orthogonal transformations,
and that the completely decomposable tensor cone and the regularly decomposable tensor cone are
closed convex cones. Furthermore, in the even-order case, the completely decomposable tensor
cone and the PSD tensor cone are dual to each other. The Hadamard product of two completely decomposable
tensors is still a completely decomposable tensor. Since one may apply the positive semi-definite
programming algorithm to detect whether a symmetric tensor is an SOS tensor or not, this gives a checkable
necessary condition for classicality of a spin-$j$ state. Further research issues on regularly
decomposable tensors are also raised.
