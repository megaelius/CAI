Creating large-scale entanglement lies at the heart of many quantum information processing protocols
and the investigation of fundamental physics. For multipartite quantum systems, it is crucial
to identify not only the presence of entanglement but also its detailed structure. This is because
in a generic experimental situation with sufficiently many subsystems involved, the production
of so-called genuine multipartite entanglement remains a formidable challenge. Consequently,
focusing exclusively on the identification of this strongest type of entanglement may result in
an all or nothing situation where some inherently quantum aspects of the resource are overlooked.
On the contrary, even if the system is not genuinely multipartite entangled, there may still be many-body
entanglement present in the system. An identification of the entanglement structure may thus provide
us with a hint about where imperfections in the setup may occur, as well as where we can identify groups
of subsystems that can still exhibit strong quantum-information-processing capabilities. However,
there is no known efficient methods to identify the underlying entanglement structure. Here, we
propose two complementary families of witnesses for the identification of such structures. They
are based on the detection of entanglement intactness and entanglement depth, each requires only
the implementation of solely two local measurements. Our method is also robust against noises and
other imperfections, as reflected by our experimental implementation of these tools to verify
the entanglement structure of five different eight-photon entangled states. We demonstrate how
their entanglement structure can be precisely and systematically inferred from the experimental
data. In achieving this goal, we also illustrate how the same set of data can be classically postprocessed
to learn the most about the measured system.
