Any measurement is intended to provide information on a system, namely knowledge about its state.
However, we learn from quantum theory that it is generally impossible to extract information without
disturbing the state of the system or its correlations with other systems. In this paper we address
the issue of the interplay between information and disturbance for a general operational probabilistic
theory. The traditional notion of disturbance considers the fate of the system state after the measurement.
However, the fact that the system state is left untouched ensures that also correlations are preserved
only in the presence of local discriminability. Here we provide the definition of disturbance that
is appropriate for a general theory. We then prove an equivalent condition for no-information without
disturbance-atomicity of the identity-namely the impossibility of achieving the trivial evolution-the
identity-as the coarse-graining of a set of non trivial ones. We prove a general theorem showing
that information that can be retrieved without disturbance corresponds to perfectly repeatable
and discriminating tests. As a consequence we prove a structure theorem for operational probabilistic
theories, showing that the set of states of any system decomposes as a direct sum of perfectly discriminable
sets, and such decomposition is preserved under system composition. Besides proving that no-information
without disturbance is implied by the purification postulate, we show via concrete examples that
the converse is not true. Finally we show that no-information without disturbance and local discriminability
are independent.
