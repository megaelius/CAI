Equality and disjointness are two of the most studied problems in communication complexity. They
have been studied for both classical and also quantum communication and for various models and modes
of communication. Buhrman et al. [Buh98] proved that the exact quantum communication complexity
for a promise version of the equality problem is ${\bf O}(\log {n})$ while the classical deterministic
communication complexity is $n+1$ for two-way communication, which was the first impressively
large (exponential) gap between quantum and classical (deterministic and probabilistic) communication
complexity. If an error is tolerated, both quantum and probabilistic communication complexities
for equality are ${\bf O}(\log {n})$. However, even if an error is tolerated, the gaps between quantum
(probabilistic) and deterministic complexity are not larger than quadratic for the disjointness
problem. It is therefore interesting to ask whether there are some promise versions of the disjointness
problem for which bigger gaps can be shown. We give a positive answer to such a question. Namely, we
prove that there exists an exponential gap between quantum (even probabilistic) communication
complexity and classical deterministic communication complexity of some specific versions of
the disjointness problem. Klauck [Kla00] proved, for any language, that the state complexity of
exact quantum/classical finite automata, which is a general model of one-way quantum finite automata,
is not less than the state complexity of an equivalent one-way deterministic finite automata (1DFA).
In this paper we show, using a communication complexity result, that situation may be different
for some promise problems. Namely, we show for certain promise problem that the gap between the state
complexity of exact one-way quantum finite automata and 1DFA can be exponential.
