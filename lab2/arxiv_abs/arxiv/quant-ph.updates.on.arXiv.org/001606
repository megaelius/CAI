Quantum computational supremacy arguments, which describe a way for a quantum computer to perform
a task that cannot also be done by a classical computer, typically require some sort of computational
assumption related to the limitations of classical computation. One common assumption is that
the polynomial hierarchy (PH) does not collapse, a stronger version of the statement that P $\neq$
NP, which leads to the conclusion that any classical simulation of certain families of quantum circuits
requires time scaling worse than any polynomial in the size of the circuits. However, the asymptotic
nature of this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these quantum circuits
must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on modern classical supercomputers.
We refine these quantum computational supremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing
fine-grained versions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a constant
$a$ and asserts that certain specific computational problems with input size $n$ require $2^{an}$
time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic algorithm. Then, we choose a specific value of $a$
for each version that we argue makes the assumption plausible, and based on these conjectures we
conclude that Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-Time (IQP) circuits with 208 qubits, Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits with 420 qubits and boson sampling circuits
(i.e. linear optical networks) with 98 photons are large enough for the task of producing samples
from their output distributions up to constant multiplicative error to be intractable on current
technology. In the first two cases, we extend this to constant additive error by introducing an average-case
fine-grained conjecture.
