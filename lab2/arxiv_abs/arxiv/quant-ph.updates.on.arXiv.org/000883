In the presence of strong magnetic fields, two-dimensional (2D) electron systems display highly
degenerate quantized energy levels called Landau levels. When the Fermi energy is placed within
the energy gap between these Landau levels, the system bulk is insulating and charge current is carried
by gapless edge modes. This is the quantum Hall effect, belonging to the remarkable class of macroscopic
quantum phenomena and the first member of an ever-growing family of topological states. While angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been a powerful tool to investigate numerous quantum phases
of matter, the traditional quantum Hall states -- and thus their momentum-resolved structure --
have remained inaccessible. Such observations are hindered by the fact that ARPES measurements
are incompatible with the application of magnetic fields. Here, we circumvent this by using graphene's
peculiar property of exhibiting large pseudomagnetic fields under particular strain patterns,
to visualize the momentum-space structure of electrons in the quantum Hall regime. By measuring
the unique energy spacing of the ensuing pseudo-Landau levels with ARPES, we confirm the Dirac nature
of the electrons in graphene and extract a pseudomagnetic field strength of B = 41 T. This momentum-resolved
study of the quantum Hall phase up to room temperature is made possible by exploiting shallow triangular
nanoprisms in the SiC substrates that generate large, uniform pseudomagnetic fields, arising
from strain, confirmed by STM and model calculations. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of
exploiting strain-induced quantum phases in 2D Dirac materials on a wafer-scale size, opening
the field to a range of new applications.
