Control electronics for superconducting quantum processors have strict requirements for accurate
command of the sensitive quantum states of their qubits. Hinging on the purity of ultra-phase-stable
oscillators to upconvert very-low-noise baseband pulses, conventional control systems can become
prohibitively complex and expensive when scaling to larger quantum devices, especially as high
sampling rates become desirable for fine-grained pulse shaping. Few-GHz radio-frequency digital-to-analog
converters (RF DACs) present a more economical avenue for high-fidelity control while simultaneously
providing greater command over the spectrum of the synthesized signal. Modern RF DACs with extra-wide
bandwidths are able to directly synthesize tones above their sampling rates, thereby keeping the
system clock rate at a level compatible with modern digital logic systems while still being able
to generate high-frequency pulses with arbitrary profiles. We have incorporated custom superconducting
qubit control logic into off-the-shelf hardware capable of low-noise pulse synthesis up to 7.5
GHz using an RF DAC clocked at 5 GHz. Our approach enables highly linear and stable microwave synthesis
over a wide bandwidth, giving rise to resource-efficient control and the potential for reducing
the required number of cables entering the cryogenic environment. We characterize the performance
of the hardware using a five-transmon superconducting device and demonstrate consistently reduced
two-qubit gate error (as low as 1.8%) accompanied by superior control chain linearity compared
to traditional configurations. The exceptional flexibility and stability further establish
a foundation for scalable quantum control beyond intermediate-scale devices.
