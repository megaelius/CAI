We present a unified description of several methods of chiral discrimination based on electric-dipole
interactions. It includes photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD), microwave rotational enantio-sensitive
spectroscopy, photoexcitation circular dichroism (PXCD) and photoelectron photoexcitation
circular dichroism (PXECD). We show that, inspite of the fact that the physics underlying the appearance
of a chiral response is very different in all these methods, the chiral observable in all cases has
a unique form. It is a polar vector given by the product of (i) the molecular pseudoscalar and (ii)
the field pseudovector specified by configurations of the electromagnetic fields interacting
with an isotropic ensemble of chiral molecules. The molecular pseudoscalar is a rotationally invariant
property, which is composed from different molecule-specific vectors and in the simplest case
is a triple product of such vectors. The key property that enables the chiral response is the non coplanarity
of the vectors forming such triple product. The key property that enables chiral detection without
using chiral electromagnetic fields is the vectorial nature of the enantio-sensitive observable.
Our compact and general expression for this observable shows what ultimately determines the efficiency
of the chiral signal and if, or when, it can reach 100%. We also discuss the differences between the
two phenomena, which rely on the bound states, PXCD and microwave enantio-sensitive spectroscopy,
and the two phenomena using the continuum states, PECD and PXECD. Finally, we extend these methods
to arbitrary polarizations of electromagnetic fields used to induce and probe the chiral response.
