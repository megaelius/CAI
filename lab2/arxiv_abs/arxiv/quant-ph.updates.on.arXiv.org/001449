The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement of a neutral K-meson (kaon) pair enjoys the peculiar
quantum behaviour of mixing, charge-parity ${\cal CP}$ violation (${\cal C}$ - charge conjugation,
${\cal P}$ - parity) and two non-orthogonal eigenstates of definite time evolution $K_L$ and $K_S$
with very different lifetimes. The dynamics of this "strange entanglement", experimentally accessible
at the $\phi$-factory, makes possible the search for novel phenomena not accessible in any other
system, i.e. at interference times and at decoherence times of the single partners after their disentanglement,
in order to unveil the nature of the correlation between the two neutral kaons. Until now, the studies
have been concentrated on the single kaon intensity distribution between the two decay times $t_1$
and $t_2$ with $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 > 0$. Here we show that the entire two single time distributions,
before each decay, are physical in both senses: "from past to future", leading to the state of the
living partner at time $t_2$ from the observation of the first decay channel at $t_1$, and "from future
to past", leading to the past state of the decayed kaon at time $t_1$ from the observation of the second
decay channel at $t_2$. Our results thus demonstrate an affirmative answer to the title: it does,
the past decayed state depends on the result of the future measurement for the living partner. This
novel effect is truly observable through the first decay time distributions. Besides the implications
for quantum physics for all $\Delta t$, at large decoherence times the resulting first decayed state
is always $K_S$, providing a genuine tag of this kaon state in the decoherence region, and a unique
and important experimental tool to prepare a pure $K_S$ beam.
