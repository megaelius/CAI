While quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit on the precision of interferometric measurements
of mechanical motion due to measurement backaction, the nonlinear nature of the coupling also leads
to parametric instabilities that place practical limits on the sensitivity by limiting the power
in the interferometer. Such instabilities have been extensively studied in the context of gravitational
wave detectors, and their presence has recently been reported in Advanced LIGO. Here, we observe
experimentally and describe theoretically a new type of optomechanical instability that arises
in two-tone backaction-evading (BAE) measurements, designed to overcome the standard quantum
limit, and demonstrate the effect in the optical domain with a photonic crystal nanobeam, and in
the microwave domain with a micromechanical oscillator coupled to a microwave resonator. In contrast
to the well-known oscillatory parametric instability that occurs in single-tone, blue-detuned
pumping, which is characterized by a vanishing effective mechanical damping, the parametric instability
in balanced two-tone optomechanics is exponential, and is a result of small detuning errors in the
two pump frequencies. Its origin can be understood in a rotating frame as the vanishing of the effective
mechanical frequency due to an optical spring effect. Counterintuitively, the instability occurs
even in the presence of perfectly balanced intracavity fields, and can occur for both signs of detuning.
We find excellent quantitative agreement with our theoretical predictions. Since the constraints
on tuning accuracy become stricter with increasing probe power, it imposes a fundamental limitation
on BAE measurements, as well as other two-tone schemes. In addition to introducing a new limitation
in two-tone BAE measurements, the results also introduce a new type of nonlinear dynamics in cavity
optomechanics.
