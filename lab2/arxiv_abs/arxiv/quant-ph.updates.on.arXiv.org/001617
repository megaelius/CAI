Quantum games represent the really 21st century branch of game theory, tightly linked to the modern
development of quantum computing and quantum technologies. The main accent in these developments
so far was made on stationary or repeated games. In the previous paper of the author the truly dynamic
quantum game theory was initiated with strategies chosen by players in real time. Since direct continuous
observations are known to destroy quantum evolutions (so-called quantum Zeno paradox) the necessary
new ingredient for quantum dynamic games represented the theory of non-direct observations and
the corresponding quantum filtering. Another remarkable 21st century branch of game theory represent
the so-called mean-field games (MFG), with impressive and ever growing development. In this paper
we are merging these two exciting new branches of game theory. Building a quantum analog of MFGs requires
the full reconstruction of its foundations and methodology, because in $N$-particle quantum evolution
particles are not separated in individual dynamics and the key concept of the classical MFG theory,
the empirical measure defined as the sum of Dirac masses of the positions of the players, is not applicable
in quantum setting. As a preliminary result we derive the new nonlinear stochastic Schr\"odinger
equation, as the limit of continuously observed and controlled system of large number of interacting
quantum particles, the result that may have an independent value. We then show that to a control quantum
system of interacting particles there corresponds a special system of classical interacting particles
with the identical limiting MFG system, defined on an appropriate Riemanian manifold. Solutions
of this system are shown to specify approximate Nash equilibria for $N$-agent quantum games.
