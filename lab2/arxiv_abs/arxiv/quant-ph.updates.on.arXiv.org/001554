We study the dynamics of a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation with mean-field Hamiltonian
that describes a simple laser under the mean field approximation. The open quantum system is formed
by a single mode optical cavity and a set of two level atoms, each coupled to a reservoir. We prove that
the mean field quantum master equation has a unique regular stationary solution. In case a relevant
parameter $C_b$, i.e., the cavity cooperative parameter, is less than 1, we prove that any regular
solution converges exponentially fast to the equilibrium, and so the regular stationary state
is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium solution. We obtain that a locally exponential
stable family of periodic solutions is born at the regular stationary state as $C_b$ passes through
the critical value 1. Then, the mean-field laser equation has a Poincar\'e-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation
at $C_b =1 $ of supercritical-like type. Namely, we derive rigorously the transition from a global
attractor quantum state, where the light is not emitted, to a locally stable set of coherent quantum
states producing coherent light. We establish the local exponential stability of the periodic
solutions in case a relevant parameter is between the first and second laser thresholds appearing
in the semiclassical laser theory. Thus, we get that the coherent laser light persists over time
under this condition. In order to prove the exponential convergence of the quantum state, as the
time goes to $+ \infty$, we develop a new technique for proving the exponential convergence in open
quantum systems that is based in a new variation of constant formula, which is obtained by combining
probabilistic techniques with classical arguments from the semigroup theory. Furthermore, we
establish the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy, the photon-number statistics, and
the quantum variance of the quadratures.
