Understanding the computational power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is
of both fundamental and practical importance to quantum information science. Here, we address
the question of whether error-uncorrected noisy quantum computers can provide computational
advantage over classical computers. Specifically, we study noisy random circuit sampling in one
dimension (or 1D noisy RCS) as a simple model for exploring the effects of noise on the computational
power of a noisy quantum device. In particular, we simulate the real-time dynamics of 1D noisy random
quantum circuits via matrix product operators (MPOs) and characterize the computational power
of the 1D noisy quantum system by using a metric we call MPO entanglement entropy. The latter metric
is chosen because it determines the cost of classical MPO simulation. We numerically demonstrate
that for the two-qubit gate error rates we considered, there exists a length scale above which adding
more qubits does not bring about an exponential growth of the cost of classical MPO simulation of
1D noisy systems. Specifically, we show that above the length scale, there is an optimal circuit
depth, independent of the system size, where the MPO entanglement entropy is maximized. Most importantly,
the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy is bounded by a constant that depends only on the
gate error rate, not on the system size. We also provide a heuristic analysis to get the scaling of
the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy as a function of the gate error rate. The obtained
scaling suggests that although the cost of MPO simulation does not increase exponentially in the
system size above a certain length scale, it does increase exponentially as the gate error rate decreases,
possibly making classical simulation practically not feasible even with a state-of-the-art supercomputer.
