Some predictions regarding pre- and post-selected particles are far-reaching, thereby requiring
validation with standard quantum measurements in addition to the customary weak measurements
used so far, as well as other advanced techniques. We go further in this research program with two
thought experiments incorporating novel yet feasible validation methods of unconventional light-matter
interactions. An excited atom traverses a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) under a special combination
of pre- and post-selection. In the first experiment, photons emitted by the superposed atom, after
being hit by two laser beams, are individually counted. Despite the interaction having definitely
taken place, as revealed by the atom becoming ground, the numbers of photons emitted from each arm
of the MZI are predicted, at the ensemble level, to be different from those expected with standard
stimulated emission of a pre-selected-only atom. In the second experiment, the atom spontaneously
emits a photon while still in the MZI. This photon later serves as a strong measurement of the atom's
energy upon hitting a photographic plate. The experiment is repeated to enable an interference
effect of the emitted photons. Surprisingly, the latter gives the appearance that the photons have
been emitted by the atom from a position much farther from the two MZI arms L and R, as if in a "phantom
arm" R'. Nevertheless, their time of arrival is similar to that of photons coming from L and R. These
experiments also emphasize the key role of negative weak values of atoms under pre- and post-selection.
The novel verification methods resemble weak measurements in some aspects, yet result from an unambiguous
atomic transitions verified by the detected photons.
