A fully relational quantum theory necessarily requires an account of changes of quantum reference
frames, where quantum reference frames are systems relative to which other systems are described.
By introducing a relational formalism which identifies coordinate systems with elements of a symmetry
group $G$ we define a general operator for reversibly changing between quantum reference frames
associated to a group $G$. This generalises the known operator for translations and boosts to arbitrary
finite and locally compact groups, including non-Abelian groups. We show under which conditions
one can uniquely assign coordinates choices to physical systems (to form reference systems) and
how to reversibly transform between them, providing transformations between coordinate systems
which are `in a superposition' of other coordinate systems. We obtain the change of quantum reference
frame from the principles of relational physics and of coherent change of reference frame. We prove
a theorem stating that the change of quantum reference frame consistent with these principles is
unitary if and only if the reference systems carry the left and right regular representations of
$G$. We also define irreversible changes of reference frame for classical and quantum systems in
the case where the symmetry group $G$ is a semi-direct product $G = N \rtimes P$ or a direct product
$G = N \times P$, providing multiple examples of both reversible and irreversible changes of quantum
reference system along the way. Finally, we apply the relational formalism and changes of reference
frame developed in this work to the Wigner's friend scenario, finding similar conclusions to those
in relational quantum mechanics using an explicit change of reference frame as opposed to indirect
reasoning using measurement operators.
