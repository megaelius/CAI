Initializing a single site of a lattice scalar field theory into an arbitrary state with support
throughout the quantum register requires ${\cal O}(2^{n_Q})$ entangling gates on a quantum computer
with $n_Q$ qubits per site. It is conceivable that, instead, initializing to functions that are
good approximations to states may have utility in reducing the number of required entangling gates.
In the case of a single site of a non-interacting scalar field theory, initializing to a symmetric
exponential wavefunction requires $n_Q-1$ entangling gates, compared with the $2^{n_Q-1} + n_Q-3
+ \delta_{n_Q,1}$ required for a symmetric Gaussian wavefunction. In this work, we explore the
initialization of 1-site ($n_Q=4$), 2-site ($n_Q=3$) and 3-site ($n_Q=3$) non-interacting scalar
field theories with symmetric exponential wavefunctions using IBM's quantum simulators and quantum
devices (Poughkeepsie and Tokyo). With the digitizations attainable with $n_Q = 3,4$, these tensor-product
wavefunctions are found to have large overlap with a Gaussian wavefunction, and provide a suitable
low-noise initialization for improvement and \emph{Somma Inflation}. In performing these simulations,
we have employed a workflow that interleaves calibrations to mitigate systematic errors in production.
The calibrations allow tolerance cuts on gate performance including the fidelity of the symmetrizing
Hadamard gate, both in vacuum ($|{\bf 0}\rangle^{\otimes n_Q}$) and in medium ($n_Q-1$ qubits
initialized to an exponential function). The results obtained in this work are relevant to systems
beyond scalar field theories, such as the deuteron radial wavefunction, 2- and 3-dimensional cartesian-space
wavefunctions, and non-relativistic multi-nucleon systems built on a localized eigenbasis.
