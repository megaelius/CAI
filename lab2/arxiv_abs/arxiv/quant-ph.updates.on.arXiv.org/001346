The Bell's theorem stands as an insuperable roadblock in the path to a very desired intuitive solution
of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and, hence, it lies at the core of the current lack of a clear
interpretation of the quantum formalism. The theorem states through an experimentally testable
inequality that the predictions of quantum mechanics for the Bell's polarization states of two
entangled particles cannot be reproduced by any statistical model of hidden variables that shares
certain intuitive features. In this paper, we show, however, that the proof of the Bell's theorem
involves a subtle, though crucial, assumption that is not required by fundamental physical principles
and, hence, it is not necessarily fulfilled in the experimental setup that tests the inequality.
In fact, this assumption can neither be properly implemented within the standard framework of quantum
mechanics. Namely, the proof of the theorem assumes that there exists a preferred absolute frame
of reference, supposedly provided by the lab, which enables to compare the orientation of the polarization
measurement devices for successive realizations of the experiment and, hence, to define jointly
their response functions over the space of hypothetical hidden configurations for all their possible
alternative settings. We notice, however, that only the relative orientation between the two measurement
devices in every single realization of the experiment is a properly defined physical degree of freedom,
while their global rigid orientation is a spurious gauge degree of freedom. Hence, the preferred
frame of reference required by the proof of the Bell's theorem does not necessarily exist. Following
this observation, we build an explicitly local model of hidden variables that reproduces the predictions
of quantum mechanics for the Bell's states.
