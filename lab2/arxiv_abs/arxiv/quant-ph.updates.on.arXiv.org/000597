Nonclassical states of a quantized light are described in terms of Glauber-Sudarshan P distribution
which is not a genuine classical probability distribution. Despite several attempts, defining
a uniform measure of nonclassicality (NC) for the single mode quantum states of light is yet an open
task. In our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 95, 012330 (2017)] we have shown that the existing well-known
measures fail to quantify the NC of single mode states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing
operations. Recently, Ivan et. al. [Quantum. Inf. Process. 11, 853 (2012)] have defined a measure
of non-Gaussian character of quantum optical states in terms of Wehrl entropy. Here, we adopt this
concept in the context of single mode NC. In this paper, we propose a new quantification of NC for the
single mode quantum states of light as the difference between the total Wehrl entropy of the state
and the maximum Wehrl entropy arising due to its classical characteristics. This we achieve by subtracting
from its Wehrl entropy, the maximum Wehrl entropy attainable by any classical state that has same
randomness as measured in terms of von-Neumann entropy. We obtain analytic expressions of NC for
most of the states, in particular, all pure states and Gaussian mixed states. However, the evaluation
of NC for the non-Gaussian mixed states is subject to extensive numerical computation that lies
beyond the scope of the current work. We show that, along with the states generated under single NC-inducing
operations, also for the broader class of states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing
operations, our quantification enumerates the NC consistently.
