Quantum batteries, composed of quantum cells, are expected to outperform their classical analogs.
The origin of such advantages lies in the role of quantum correlations, which may arise during the
charging and discharging processes performed on the battery. In this theoretical work, we introduce
a systematic characterization of the relevant quantities of quantum batteries, i.e., the capacity
and the power, in relation to such correlations. For these quantities, we derive upper bounds for
batteries that are a collection of noninteracting quantum cells with fixed Hamiltonians. The capacity,
that is, a bound on the stored or extractable energy, is derived with the help of the energy-entropy
diagram, and this bound is respected as long as the charging and discharging processes are entropy
preserving. While studying power, we consider a geometric approach for the evolution of the battery
state in the energy eigenspace of the battery Hamiltonian. Then, an upper bound for power is derived
for arbitrary charging process, in terms of the Fisher information and the energy variance of the
battery. The former quantifies the speed of evolution, and the latter encodes the nonlocal character
of the battery state. Indeed, due to the fact that the energy variance is bounded by the multipartite
entanglement properties of batteries composed of qubits, we establish a fundamental bound on power
imposed by quantum entanglement. We also discuss paradigmatic models for batteries that saturate
the bounds both for the stored energy and power. Several experimentally realizable quantum batteries,
based on integrable spin chains, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and the Dicke models, are also studied
in the light of these newly introduced bounds.
