Heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems offer novel architectures accommodating
specialized processors that accelerate specific workloads. Near-term quantum computing technologies
are poised to benefit applications as wide-ranging as quantum chemistry, machine learning, and
optimization. A novel approach to scale these applications with future heterogeneous HPC is to
enhance conventional computing systems with quantum processor accelerators. We present the eXtreme-scale
ACCelerator programming model (XACC) to enable near-term quantum acceleration within existing
conventional HPC applications and workflows. We design and demonstrate the XACC programming model
within the C++ language by following a coprocessor machine model akin to the design of OpenCL or CUDA
for GPUs. However, we take into account the subtleties and complexities inherent to the interplay
between conventional and quantum processing hardware. The XACC framework provides a high-level
API that enables applications to offload computational work represented as quantum kernels for
execution on an attached quantum accelerator. Our approach is agnostic to the quantum programming
language and the quantum processor hardware, which enables quantum programs to be ported to multiple
processors for benchmarking, verification and validation, and performance studies. This includes
a set of virtual numerical simulators as well as actual quantum processing units. The XACC programming
model and its reference implementation may serve as a foundation for future HPC-ready applications,
data structures, and libraries using conventional-quantum hybrid computing.
