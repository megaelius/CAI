We propose a scheme that can generate tunable optomechanical induced transparency (OMIT) in a hybrid
piezo-optomechanical cavity system. The system is constituted of a high quality planar distributed
Bragg reflectors (DBR) cavity, which the quality is improved by an embedded submicrometer three-dimensional
Gaussian-shaped defect. Moreover, the interdigitated transducers (IDTs) are fabricated on the
surface of the cavity to generate the surface acoustic waves (SAW). Here, the DBR cavity structure
modified with the embedded Gaussian-shaped defect is proposed by F.Ding et al., relative to the
traditional DBR structures with the same number of mirror pairs, the quality factor of this design
can be effectively improved by nearly two orders, which can exceed 1000000. We show that when a strong
pump optical field and a weak probe optical field are applied to the hybrid cavity system simultaneously,
at the presence of the SAW, a transmission window can be obtained in the weak output probe field. This
phenomenon arises because that under the actuation of the SAW, the upper Bragg mirrors is vibrated
as a bulk acoustic resonator(BAR). Then the two-level system formed by the energy levels of the DBR
cavity is turned into a standard three-level optomechanical cavity system, which is formed by the
energy levels of the DBR cavity and the BAR. Under the quantum interference between different energy-level
pathways, the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) occurs, as a result, the transmission
window is observed in the weak output probe field. Inversely, without the actuation of the SAW, the
transmission window disappears. Our scheme can be applied in the fields of optical switches and
quantum information processing in solid-state quantum systems.
