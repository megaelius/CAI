We consider a scenario in which qubit-like probes are used to sense an external field that linearly
affects their energy splitting. Following the frequency estimation approach in which one optimizes
the state and sensing time of the probes to maximize the sensitivity, we provide a systematic study
of the attainable precision under the impact of noise originating from independent bosonic baths.
We invoke an explicit microscopic derivation of the probe dynamics using the spin-boson model with
weak coupling of arbitrary geometry and clarify how the secular approximation leads to a phase-covariant
dynamics, where the noise terms commute with the field Hamiltonian, while the inclusion of non-secular
terms breaks the phase-covariance. Moreover, unless one restricts to a particular (i.e., Ohmic)
spectral density of the bath modes, the noise terms may contain relevant information about the frequency
to be estimated. Thus, by considering general evolutions of a single probe, we study regimes in which
these two effects have a non-negligible impact on the achievable precision. We then consider baths
of Ohmic spectral density yet fully accounting for the lack of phase-covariance, in order to characterize
the ultimate attainable scaling of precision when $N$ probes are used in parallel. Crucially, we
show that beyond the semigroup (Lindbladian) regime the Zeno limit imposing the $1/N^{3/2}$ scaling
of the mean squared error, derived assuming phase-covariance, generalises to any dynamics of the
probes, unless the latter are coupled to the baths in the direction perfectly transversal to the
encoding---when a novel scaling of $1/N^{7/4}$ arises. As our microscopic approach covers all
classes of dissipative dynamics, from semigroup to non-Markovian ones (potentially non-phase-covariant),
it provides an exhaustive picture, in which all the different asymptotic scalings of precision
naturally emerge.
