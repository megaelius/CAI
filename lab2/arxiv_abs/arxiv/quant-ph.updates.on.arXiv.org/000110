In existing superconducting electronic systems, Josephson junctions play a central role in processing
and transmitting small-amplitude electrical signals. However, Josephson-junction-based devices
have a number of limitations including: (1) sensitivity to magnetic fields, (2) limited gain, (3)
inability to drive large impedances, and (4) difficulty in controlling the junction critical current
(which depends sensitively on sub-Angstrom-scale thickness variation of the tunneling barrier).
Here we present a nanowire-based superconducting electronic device, which we call the nanocryotron
(nTron), that does not rely on Josephson junctions and can be patterned from a single thin film of
superconducting material with conventional electron-beam lithography. The nTron is a 3-terminal,
T-shaped planar device with a gain of ~20 that is capable of driving impedances of more than 100 k{\Omega},
and operates in typical ambient magnetic fields at temperatures of 4.2K. The device uses a localized,
Joule-heated hotspot formed in the gate to modulate current flow in a perpendicular superconducting
channel. We have characterized the nTron, matched it to a theoretical framework, and applied it
both as a digital logic element in a half-adder circuit, and as a digital amplifier for superconducting
nanowire single-photon detectors pulses. The nTron has immediate applications in classical and
quantum communications, photon sensing and astronomy, and its performance characteristics make
it compatible with existing superconducting technologies. Furthermore, because the hotspot
effect occurs in all known superconductors, we expect the design to be extensible to other materials,
providing a path to digital logic, switching, and amplification in high-temperature superconductors.
