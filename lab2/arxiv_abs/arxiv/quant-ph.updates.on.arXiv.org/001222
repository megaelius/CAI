In quantum error correction, the description of noise channel cannot be completely accurate, and
fluctuation always appears in noise channel. It is found that when fluctuation of physical noise
channel is considered, the average effective channel is dependent only on the average of physical
noise channel, and the average of physical noise channel here plays the role of the independent error
model in the previous works. Now, one may conclude that in the independent error model, the results
in previous works are also valid for average channel where fluctuation exists. In some typical cases,
our numerical simulations in the concatenated QEC protocol with 5-qubit code, 7-qubit Steane code
and 9-qubit Shor confirm this conjecture. For 5-qubit code, the effective channels are approximate
to depolarizing channel as the concatenated level increases. For Steane code, the effective channels
are approximate to one Pauli channel as the concatenated level increases. For Shor code, the effective
channels are approximate to one of Pauli-$X$ and Pauli-$Z$ channels in each level, and in next concatenated
level, the effective channels are approximate to the other. Meanwhile, for these codes, the numerical
results indicate that the degree of approximation increases with the concatenated level increases,
and the fluctuation of noise channel decays exponentially as concatenated QEC performed. On the
error-correction threshold, attenuation ratio of standard deviation of channel fidelity roughly
has a stable value. On the other hand, standard deviations of off-diagonal elements of quantum process
matrix (Pauli Form) decay more quickly than standard deviations of diagonal elements.
