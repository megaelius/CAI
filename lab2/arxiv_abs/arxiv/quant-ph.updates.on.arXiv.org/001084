We theoretically analyze the observations reported in a four-path quantum interference experiment
via multiple beam Ramsey interference [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 559 (2001)]. In this experiment, a selective
scattering of photons from just one interfering path causes decoherence. However, contrary to
expectations, there is an increase in the contrast of the interference pattern, demonstrating
that path selective decoherence can not only lead to a decrease, but under certain conditions, to
an increase of the fringe contrast. Here we explain this seemingly counter-intuitive effect based
on a model for a multi-path interference, with four to six slits, in the presence of decoherence.
The effect of the environment is modeled via a coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators. When decoherence
is introduced in one of the multiple paths, an enhancement in fringe contrast is seen under certain
conditions. A similar effect is shown to appear if instead of path-selective decoherence, a selective
path detector is introduced. Our analysis points to the fact that while traditional fringe visibility
captures the wave nature in the two-path case, it can fail in multi-path situations. We explain the
enhancement of fringe visibility and also show that quantum coherence based on the l1 norm of coherence,
in contrast to traditional visibility, remains a good quantifier of wave nature, even in such situations.
The enhancement of fringe contrast in the presence of environmental decoherence underscores the
limitations of traditional visibility as a good measure for wave nature in quantifying complementarity
and also makes it an unlikely candidate for quantifying decoherence. Our analysis could lead to
better insight in ways to quantify decoherence in multi-path interference, and in studies that
seek to exploit quantum superpositions and quantum coherence for quantum information applications.
