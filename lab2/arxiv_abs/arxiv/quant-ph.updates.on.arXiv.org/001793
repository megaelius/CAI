Fermion-to-qubit mappings that preserve geometric locality are especially useful for simulating
lattice fermion models (e.g., the Hubbard model) on a quantum computer. They avoid the overhead
associated with geometric non-local parity terms in mappings such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation
and the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. As a result, they often provide quantum circuits with lower
depth and gate complexity. In such encodings, fermionic states are encoded in the common +1 eigenspace
of a set of stabilizers, akin to stabilizer quantum error-correcting codes. Here, we discuss several
known geometric locality-preserving mappings and their abilities to correct/detect single-qubit
errors. We introduce a geometric locality-preserving map, whose stabilizers correspond to products
of Majorana operators on closed paths of the fermionic hopping graph. We show that our code, which
we refer to as the Majorana loop stabilizer code (MLSC) can correct all single-qubit errors on a 2-dimensional
square lattice, while previous geometric locality-preserving codes can only detect single-qubit
errors on the same lattice. Compared to existing codes, the MLSC maps the relevant fermionic operators
to lower-weight qubit operators despite having higher code distance. Going beyond lattice models,
we demonstrate that the MLSC is compatible with state-of-the-art algorithms for simulating quantum
chemistry, and can offer those simulations the same error-correction properties without additional
asymptotic overhead. These properties make the MLSC a promising candidate for error-mitigated
quantum simulations of fermions on near-term devices.
