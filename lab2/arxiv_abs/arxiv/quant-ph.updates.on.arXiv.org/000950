Gaussian errors such as excitation losses, thermal noise and additive Gaussian noise errors are
key challenges in realizing large-scale fault-tolerant continuous-variable (CV) quantum information
processing and therefore bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) is essential. In many bosonic
QEC schemes proposed so far, a finite dimensional discrete-variable (DV) quantum system is encoded
into noisy CV systems. In this case, the bosonic nature of the physical CV systems is lost at the error-corrected
logical level. On the other hand, there are several proposals for encoding an infinite dimensional
CV system into noisy CV systems. However, these CV-into-CV encoding schemes are in the class of Gaussian
quantum error correction and therefore cannot correct practically relevant Gaussian errors due
to established no-go theorems which state that Gaussian errors cannot be corrected by Gaussian
QEC schemes. Here, we work around these no-go results and show that it is possible to correct Gaussian
errors using GKP states as non-Gaussian resources. In particular, we propose a family of non-Gaussian
quantum error-correcting codes, GKP-repetition codes, and demonstrate that they can correct
additive Gaussian noise errors. In addition, we generalize our GKP-repetition codes to an even
broader class of non-Gaussian QEC codes, namely, GKP-stabilizer codes and show that there exists
a highly hardware-efficient GKP-stabilizer code, the two-mode GKP-squeezed-repetition code,
that can quadratically suppress additive Gaussian noise errors in both the position and momentum
quadratures. Moreover, for any GKP-stabilizer code, we show that logical Gaussian operations
can be readily implemented by using only physical Gaussian operations. Finally, we also discuss
how our GKP-stabilizer coding schemes can be used to correct Gaussian excitation losses and thermal
noise as well as additive Gaussian noise errors.
