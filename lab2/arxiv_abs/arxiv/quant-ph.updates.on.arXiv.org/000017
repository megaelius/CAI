The aim of this dissertation is to clarify the debate over the explanation of quantum speedup and
to submit a tentative resolution to it. In particular, I argue that the physical explanation for
quantum speedup is precisely the fact that the phenomenon of quantum entanglement enables a quantum
computer to fully exploit the representational capacity of Hilbert space. This is impossible for
classical systems, joint states of which must always be representable as product states. Chapter
2 begins with a discussion of the most popular of the candidate physical explanations for quantum
speedup: the many worlds explanation. I argue that unlike the neo-Everettian interpretation of
quantum mechanics it does not have the conceptual resources required to overcome the `preferred
basis objection'. I further argue that the many worlds explanation, at best, can serve as a good description
of the physical process which takes place in so-called network-based computation, but that it is
incompatible with other models of computation such as cluster state quantum computing. I next consider,
in Chapter 3, a common component of most other candidate explanations of quantum speedup: quantum
entanglement. I investigate whether entanglement can be said to be a necessary component of any
explanation for quantum speedup, and I consider two major purported counter-examples to this claim.
I argue that neither of these, in fact, show that entanglement is unnecessary for speedup, and that,
on the contrary, we should conclude that it is. In Chapters 4 and 5 I then ask whether entanglement
can be said to be sufficient as well. In Chapter 4 I argue that despite a result that seems to indicate
the contrary, entanglement, considered as a resource, can be seen as sufficient to enable quantum
speedup. Finally, in Chapter 5 I argue that entanglement is sufficient to explain quantum speedup
as well.
