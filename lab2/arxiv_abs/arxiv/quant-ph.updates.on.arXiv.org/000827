In contrast to observables and measured beables, which are synonyms referred to in this paper as
measured properties, we define the concept of unmeasured property as the value of a beable belonging
to a quantum system that is not interacting with the measuring apparatus. We show that, by construction,
measured and unmeasured single-time expectation values are identical. Contrarily, multiple-time
measured and unmeasured expectation values, defined, e.g., through time-correlations functions,
are generally different. Unmeasured two-times correlation functions have, in general, no analogous
observable. Even when the later is obtained through a two-time ideally weak measurement, with an
almost negligible perturbation on the system state, measured and unmeasured dynamical properties
are different. This work clarifies common misunderstandings when comparing measured and unmeasured
properties of quantum systems, a common strategy to discredit hidden-variable theories. Furthermore,
it highlights the usefulness of unmeasured properties to provide valuable, intermediate, information
for calculating observables of large (computationally inaccessible) systems. While it is a standard
practice in classical mechanics to compute the dynamics of certain subsystems and use this information
to elaborate on the properties of a larger containing system, the extension of such procedure in
quantum mechanics hides a conceptual difficulty. In this work we explore the possibility of extending
the standard classical procedure by using Bohmian mechanics, which does not only reproduce any
observable by construction, but allows a clear-cut definition of unmeasured properties of quantum
systems. The tunneling time, the work distribution or the high-frequency electrical current are
shown to be paradigmatic examples of the practical utility of unmeasured properties.
