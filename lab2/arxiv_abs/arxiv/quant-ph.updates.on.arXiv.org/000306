Complex space-time has proven useful in general relativity, and in Bohmian mechanics. Complexified
Li\.enard-Wiechert potentials simplify the mathematics of Kerr-Newman particles. Here we constrain
them to move along Bohmian trajectories. A covariant theory due to Stueckelberg is used. The trajectories
typically become multi-valued. A tractable Gaussian wave is analyzed. A single trajectory is replaced
by two trajectories on different Riemann sheets which are connected by analytical continuation
in the world-time variable. An extension of analytic continuation that adds different Riemann
sheets of a function together with complex weighting factors is applied. Whereas there are only
two Bohmian trajectories connected by standard analytic continuation, there are an infinite number
of trajectories that are connected by this generalized analytic continuation (GAN). Moreover,
all the Bohmian trajectories can be derived from just a single one by applying GAN to it. This is suggestive
of wave-particle duality. Maxwell's equations in complex space-time are different in that rather
than a single retarded time solution contributing in a field calculation for a timelike trajectory
in real space-time, there are multiple null roots. In the Bohmian case studied here there are an infinite
number of retarded times associated with a single trajectory through the GAN continuation, and
when one adds up their contribution weighted naturally by the Bohmian weighting factors, one finds
the total radiated power goes to zero for a free particle. This is a major improvement over traditional
Bohm models where even free charged particles would radiate if coupled classically. Thus a major
point of this paper is to allow Bohmian particles to interact with classical electromagnetic fields
without producing obviously unphysical effects. Some implications of these results are discussed.
