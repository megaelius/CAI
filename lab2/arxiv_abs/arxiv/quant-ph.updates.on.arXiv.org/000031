Quantum de Finetti theorems are a useful tool in the study of correlations in quantum multipartite
states. In this paper we prove two new quantum de Finetti theorems, both showing that under tests
formed by local measurements one can get a much improved error dependence on the dimension of the
subsystems. We also obtain similar results for non-signaling probability distributions. We give
the following applications of the results: We prove the optimality of the Chen-Drucker protocol
for 3-SAT, under the exponential time hypothesis. We show that the maximum winning probability
of free games can be estimated in polynomial time by linear programming. We also show that 3-SAT with
m variables can be reduced to obtaining a constant error approximation of the maximum winning probability
under entangled strategies of O(m^{1/2})-player one-round non-local games, in which the players
communicate O(m^{1/2}) bits all together. We show that the optimization of certain polynomials
over the hypersphere can be performed in quasipolynomial time in the number of variables n by considering
O(log(n)) rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy of semidefinite programs.
As an application to entanglement theory, we find a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for deciding
multipartite separability. We consider a result due to Aaronson -- showing that given an unknown
n qubit state one can perform tomography that works well for most observables by measuring only O(n)
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of the state -- and relax the assumption
of having i.i.d copies of the state to merely the ability to select subsystems at random from a quantum
multipartite state. The proofs of the new quantum de Finetti theorems are based on information theory,
in particular on the chain rule of mutual information.
