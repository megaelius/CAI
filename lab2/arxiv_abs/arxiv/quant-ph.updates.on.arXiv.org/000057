In this work, we investigate aspects of the electron, muon and tau gyromagnetic ratios (g-factor)
in a fractional coarse-grained scenario, by adopting a Modified Riemann-Liouville (MRL) fractional
calculus. We point out the possibility of mapping the experimental values of the specie's g-factors
into a theoretical parameter which accounts for fractionality, without computing higher-order
QED calculations. We wish to understand whether the value of (g-2) may be traced back to a fractionality
of space-time.The justification for the difference between the experimental and the theoretical
value g=2 stemming from the Dirac equation is given in the terms of the complexity of the interactions
of the charged leptons, considered as pseudo-particles and "dressed" by the interactions and the
medium. Stepwise, we build up a fractional Dirac equation from the fractional Weyl equation that,
on the other hand, was formulated exclusively in terms of the helicity operator. From the fractional
angular momentum algebra, in a coarse-grained scenario, we work out the eigenvalues of the spin
operator. Based on the standard electromagnetic current, as an analogy case, we write down a fractional
Lagrangian density, with the electromagnetic field minimally coupled to the particular charged
lepton. We then study a fractional gauge-like invariance symmetry, formulate the covariant fractional
derivative and propose the spinor field transformation. Finally, by taking the non-relativistic
regime of the fractional Dirac equation, the fractional Pauli equation is obtained and, from that,
an explicit expression for the fractional g-factor comes out that is compared with the experimental
CODATA value. Our claim is that the different lepton species must probe space-time by experiencing
different fractionalities, once the latter may be associated to the effective interactions of
the different families with the medium.
