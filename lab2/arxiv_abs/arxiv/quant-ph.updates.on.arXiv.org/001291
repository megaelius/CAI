The realization of self-assembled molecular-electronic films, whose room-temperature transport
properties are controlled by quantum interference (QI), is an essential step in the scale-up QI
effects from single molecules to parallel arrays of molecules. Recently, the effect of destructive
QI (DQI) on the electrical conductance of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been investigated.
Here, through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate chemical
control of different forms of constructive QI (CQI) in cross-plane transport through SAMs and assess
its influence on cross-plane thermoelectricity in SAMs. It is known that the electrical conductance
of single molecules can be controlled in a deterministic manner, by chemically varying their connectivity
to external electrodes. Here, by employing synthetic methodologies to vary the connectivity of
terminal anchor groups around aromatic anthracene cores, and by forming SAMs of the resulting molecules,
we clearly demonstrate that this signature of CQI can be translated into SAM-on-gold molecular
films. We show that the conductance of vertical molecular junctions formed from anthracene-based
molecules with two different connectivities differ by a factor of approximately 16, in agreement
with theoretical predictions for their conductance ratio based on constructive QI effects within
the core. We also demonstrate that for molecules with thiol anchor groups, the Seebeck coefficient
of such films is connectivity dependent and with an appropriate choice of connectivity can be boosted
by ~50%. This demonstration of QI and its influence on thermoelectricity in SAMs represents a critical
step towards functional ultra-thin-film devices for future thermoelectric and molecular-scale
electronics applications.
