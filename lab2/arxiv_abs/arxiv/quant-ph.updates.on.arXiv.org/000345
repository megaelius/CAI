Elastic strain engineering utilizes stress to realize unusual material properties. For instance,
strain can be used to enhance the electron mobility of a semiconductor, enabling more efficient
solar cells and smaller, faster transistors. In the context of nanomechanics, the pursuit of resonators
with ultra-high coherence has led to intense study of a complementary strain engineering technique,
"dissipation dilution", whereby the stiffness of a material is effectively increased without
added loss. Dissipation dilution is known to underlie the anomalously high Q factor of Si$_3$N$_4$
nanomechanical resonators, including recently-developed "soft-clamped" resonators; however,
the paradigm has to date relied on weak strain produced during material synthesis. By contrast,
the use of geometric strain engineering techniques -- capable of producing local stresses near
the material yield strength -- remains largely unexplored. Here we show that geometric strain combined
with soft-clamping can produce unprecedentedly high Q nanomechanical resonators. Specifically,
using a spatially non-uniform phononic crystal pattern, we colocalize the strain and flexural
motion of a Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam, while increasing the former to near the yield strength. This combined
strategy produces string-like modes with room-temperature Q$\times$frequency products approaching
$10^{15}$ Hz, an unprecedented value for a mechanical oscillator of any size. The devices we study
can have force sensitivities of aN/rtHz, perform hundreds of quantum coherent oscillations at
room temperature, and attain Q > 400 million at radio frequencies. These results signal a paradigm
shift in the control of nanomechanical dissipation, with impact ranging from precision force microscopy
to tests of quantum gravity. Combining the reported approach with crystalline or 2D materials may
lead to further improvement, of as yet unknown limitation.
