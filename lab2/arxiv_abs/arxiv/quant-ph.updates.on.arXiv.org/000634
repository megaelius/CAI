We study quantum communication protocols, in which the players' storage starts out in a state where
one qubit is in a pure state, and all other qubits are totally mixed (i.e. in a random state), and no
other storage is available (for messages or internal computations). This restriction on the available
quantum memory has been studied extensively in the model of quantum circuits, and it is known that
classically simulating quantum circuits operating on such memory is hard when the additive error
of the simulation is exponentially small (in the input length), under the assumption that the polynomial
hierarchy does not collapse. We study this setting in communication complexity. The goal is to consider
larger additive error for simulation-hardness results, and to not use unproven assumptions. We
define a complexity measure for this model that takes into account that standard error reduction
techniques do not work here. We define a clocked and a semi-unclocked model, and describe efficient
simulations between those. We characterize a one-way communication version of the model in terms
of weakly unbounded error communication complexity. Our main result is that there is a quantum protocol
using one clean qubit only and using $O(\log n)$ qubits of communication, such that any classical
protocol simulating the acceptance behaviour of the quantum protocol within additive error $1/poly(n)$
needs communication $\Omega(n)$. We also describe a candidate problem, for which an exponential
gap between the one-clean-qubit communication complexity and the randomized complexity is likely
to hold, and hence a classical simulation of the one-clean-qubit model within {\em constant} additive
error might be hard in communication complexity. We describe a geometrical conjecture that implies
the lower bound.
