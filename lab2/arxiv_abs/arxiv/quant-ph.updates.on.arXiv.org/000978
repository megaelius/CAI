For the quantum correlations between scattered modes in the disordered media, the previous works
focus mainly on the cases where the inputs are non-superposed states, for instance, products of
Fock states [Phys. Rev. Letts. 105 (2010) 090501]. A natural question that arises is how the superpositions
affect the quantum correlations. Following this trail, the comparison between superpositions
and products of Fock states is performed. It is found an interesting phenomenon that for the superposition
and the corresponding product of Fock state (non-Gaussian states), their averaged quantum correlations
are nearly same, whereas the distributions of their quantum correlations might be different. Therefore,
superpositions may affect the distributions of the quantum correlations. In addition, to examine
how the Gaussian states affect the quantum correlations, we compare the typical Gaussian states
with the non-Gaussian states (superpositions and products of Fock states). It is discovered that
the non-Gaussian-state input could result in the quantum correlation that is either positive or
negative, depending on the number of the input modes and the number of the photons in each mode, whereas
the Gaussian-state input always leads to the non-negative quantum correlation. Besides, it is
demonstrated that with the increase of the disorder strength, the mean strength of the quantum correlation
increases for multi-mode-state inputs (except for multi-mode-coherent-state inputs). These
results may be useful to control and adjust the quantum properties of scattered modes after the quantized
lights propagating through the disordered medium.
