Semiconductor qubits rely on the control of charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons or holes
confined in quantum dots (QDs). They constitute a promising approach to quantum information processing
[1, 2], complementary to superconducting qubits [3]. Typically, semiconductor qubit-qubit coupling
is short range [1, 2, 4, 5], effectively limiting qubit distance to the spatial extent of the wavefunction
of the confined particle, which represents a significant constraint towards scaling to reach dense
1D or 2D arrays of QD qubits. Following the success of circuit quantum eletrodynamics [6], the strong
coupling regime between the charge [7, 8] and spin [9, 10, 11] degrees of freedom of electrons confined
in semiconducting QDs interacting with individual photons stored in a microwave resonator has
recently been achieved. In this letter, we demonstrate coherent coupling between a superconducting
transmon qubit and a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit mediated by virtual microwave
photon excitations in a tunable high-impedance SQUID array resonator acting as a quantum bus [12,
13, 14]. The transmon-charge qubit coherent coupling rate ($ \sim$ 21 MHz) exceeds the linewidth
of both the transmon ($ \sim$ 0.8 MHz) and the DQD charge ($ \sim$ 3 MHz) qubit. By tuning the qubits
into resonance for a controlled amount of time, we observe coherent oscillations between the constituents
of this hybrid quantum system. These results enable a new class of experiments exploring the use
of the two-qubit interactions mediated by microwave photons to create entangled states between
semiconductor and superconducting qubits. The methods and techniques presented here are transferable
to QD devices based on other material systems and can be beneficial for spin-based hybrid systems.
