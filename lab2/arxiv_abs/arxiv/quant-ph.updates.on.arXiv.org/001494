Exceptional points (EPs) are degeneracies of classical and quantum open systems, which are studied
in many areas of physics including optics, optoelectronics, plasmonics, and condensed matter
physics. In the semiclassical regime, open systems can be described by phenomenological effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) capturing the effects of gain and loss in terms of imaginary
fields. The EPs that characterize the spectra of such Hamiltonians (HEPs) describe the time evolution
of a system without quantum jumps. It is well known that a full quantum treatment describing more
generic dynamics must crucially take into account such quantum jumps. In a recent paper [Minganti
$et$ $al.$, Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{100}$, $062131$ ($2019$)], we generalized the notion of EPs to
the spectra of Liouvillian superoperators governing open system dynamics described by Linblad
master equations. Intriguingly, we found that in situations where a classical to quantum correspondence
exists, the two types of dynamics can yield different EPs. In a recent experimental work [Naghiloo
$et$ $al.$ Nat. Phys. $\mathbf{15}$, $1232$ ($2019$)], it was shown that one can engineer a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian in the quantum limit by postselecting on certain quantum jump trajectories. This raises
an interesting question concerning the relation between Hamiltonian and Lindbladian EPs, and
quantum trajectories. We discuss these connections by introducing a hybrid-Liouvillian superoperator,
capable of describing the passage from an NHH (when one postselects only those trajectories without
quantum jumps) to a true Liouvillian including quantum jumps (without postselection). Beyond
its fundamental interest, our approach allows to efficiently discuss and analyze postselection
on finite-efficiency detectors.
