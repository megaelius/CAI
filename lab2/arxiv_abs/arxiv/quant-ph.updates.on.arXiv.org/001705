In general relativity, the causal structure between events is dynamical, but it is definite and
observer-independent; events are point-like and the membership of an event A in the future or past
light-cone of an event B is an observer-independent statement. When events are defined with respect
to quantum systems however, nothing guarantees that the causal relationship between A and B is definite.
We propose to associate a causal reference frame corresponding to each event, which can be interpreted
as an observer-dependent time according to which an observer describes the evolution of quantum
systems. In the causal reference frame of one event, this particular event is always localised,
but other events can be "smeared out" in the future and in the past. We do not impose a predefined causal
order between the events, but only require that descriptions from different reference frames obey
a global consistency condition. We show that our new formalism is equivalent to the pure process
matrix formalism. The latter is known to predict certain multipartite correlations, which are
incompatible with the assumption of a causal ordering of the events -- these correlations violate
causal inequalities. We show how the causal reference frame description can be used to gain insight
into the question of realisability of such strongly non-causal processes in laboratory experiments.
As another application, we use causal reference frames to revisit a thought experiment where the
gravitational time dilation due to a massive object in a quantum superposition of positions leads
to a superposition of the causal ordering of two events.
