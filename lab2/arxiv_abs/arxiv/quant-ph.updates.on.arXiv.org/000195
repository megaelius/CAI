Any physical process can be represented as a quantum channel mapping an initial state to a final state.
Hence it can be characterized from the point of view of communication theory, i.e., in terms of its
ability to transfer information. Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the
proper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of codes and communication
capacities have been introduced by generalizing them from the classical Shannon theory of information
transmission and error correction. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the
channel not as acting on a single system, but on sequences of systems, which, when properly initialized
allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by the physical process under consideration. While
most of the work produced so far has been focused on the case in which a given channel transformation
acts identically and independently on the various elements of the sequence (memoryless configuration
in jargon), correlated error models appear to be a more realistic way to approach the problem. A slightly
different, yet conceptually related, notion of correlated errors applies to a single quantum system
which evolves continuously in time under the influence of an external disturbance which acts on
it in a non-Markovian fashion. This leads to the study of memory effects in quantum channels: a fertile
ground where interesting novel phenomena emerge at the intersection of quantum information theory
and other branches of physics. A survey is taken of the field of quantum channels theory while also
embracing these specific and complex settings.
