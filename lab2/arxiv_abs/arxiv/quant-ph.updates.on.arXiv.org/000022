This article contains a local solution to the notorious Problem of Time in Quantum Gravity at the
conceptual level and which is actually realizable for the relational triangle. The Problem of Time
is that `time' in GR and `time' in ordinary quantum theory are mutually incompatible notions, which
is problematic in trying to put these two theories together to form a theory of Quantum Gravity. Four
frontiers to this resolution in full GR are identified, alongside three further directions not
yet conquered even for the relational triangle. This article is also the definitive review on relational
particle models originally due to Barbour (2003: dynamics of pure shape) and Barbour and Bertotti
(1982: dynamics of shape and scale). These are exhibited as useful toy models of background independence,
which I argue to be the `other half' of GR to relativistic gravitation, as well as the originator of
the Problem of Time itself. Barbour's work and my localized extension of it are shown to be the classical
precursor of the background independence that then manifests itself at the quantum level as the
full-blown Problem of Time. In fact 7/8ths of the Isham--Kuchar Problem of Time facets are already
present in classical GR; even classical mechanics in relational particle mechanics formulation
exhibits 5/8ths of these! In addition to Isham, Kuchar and Barbour, the other principal authors
whose works are drawn upon in building this Problem of Time approach are Kendall (relational models
only: pure-shape configuration spaces), Dirac, Teitelboim and Halliwell (Problem of Time resolving
components). The recommended scheme is a combination of the Machian semiclassical approach, histories
theory and records theory.
