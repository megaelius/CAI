Measurements on a quantum particle unavoidably affect its state, since the otherwise unitary evolution
of the system is interrupted by a non-unitary projection operation. In order to probe measurement-induced
effects in the state dynamics using a quantum simulator, the challenge is to implement controlled
measurements on a small subspace of the system and continue the evolution from the complementary
subspace. A powerful platform for versatile quantum evolution is represented by photonic quantum
walks due to their high control over all relevant parameters. However, measurement-induced dynamics
in such a platform have not yet been realized. Here we implement controlled measurements in a discrete-time
quantum walk based on time multiplexing. This is achieved by adding a deterministic out-coupling
of the optical signal to include measurements constrained to specific positions resulting in the
projection of the walker's state on the remaining ones. With this platform and coherent input light
we experimentally simulate measurement-induced single particle quantum dynamics. We demonstrate
the difference between dynamics with only a single measurement at the final step and those including
measurements during the evolution. To this aim we study recurrence as a figure of merit, i.e. the
return probability to the walker's starting position, which is measured in the two cases. We track
the development of the return probability over 36 time steps and observe the onset of both recurrent
and transient evolution as an effect of the different measurement schemes, a signature which only
emerges for quantum systems. Our simulation of the observed one particle conditional quantum dynamics
does not require a genuine quantum particle but is demonstrated with coherent light.
