Quantum entanglement underlies quantum technologies, and is notoriously sensitive to decohering
processes. For this reason, many implementations take elaborate measures to remove entropy from
their environments, e.g. cryogenics or optical cooling to reach mK to nK temperatures. Here we demonstrate
that the opposite strategy, actively promoting strong interactions and thermalization, can excel
in generating and preserving entanglement. We work with a vapour of $^{87}$Rb heated to 450K and
a number density of $3.6 \times 10^{14} {\rm atoms/cm^3}$. Under these conditions random spin-exchange
collisions dominate the spin physics, giving a single-atom coherence time of $\sim 25 {\rm \mu s}$
and rapid local spin thermalization. This same physics paradoxically generates a maximum-entropy
many-body state with much longer coherence time, via the so-called spin-exchange-relaxation-free
(SERF) effect. To generate and quantify entanglement in this system, we perform optical quantum
non-demolition (QND) measurement and use Kalman filtering techniques to reconstruct the spin
dynamics in real-time. We observe extremely efficient entanglement generation, including projection
of at least $2.3 \times 10^{13}$ atoms into non-local singlet states that last for $\sim 1.8$ ms,
i.e., tens of thermalization times. In addition to breaking all records for entanglement generation,
and synthesising for the first time a many-body state resembling a spin liquid, this shows that the
unique properties of SERF-regime ensembles are extremely attractive for QND-based quantum technologies,
with potential applications in quantum memories, quantum sensing and quantum simulation.
