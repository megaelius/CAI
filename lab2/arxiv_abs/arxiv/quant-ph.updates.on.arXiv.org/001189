We propose a technique for accurate, flexible and robust generation of arbitrary coherent superpositions
of two quantum states. It uses a sequence of two adiabatic pulses split by a phase jump serving as a
control parameter. Each pulse has a chirped detuning, which induces a half crossing, and acts as
a $\pi/2$ pulse in the adiabatic regime. The phase jump is imprinted onto the population ratio of
the created superposition state. Of the various possible relations between the two pulses, we select
the case when the Rabi frequency and the detuning of the second pulse are mirror images of those of
the first pulse, and the two detunings have opposite signs. Then the mixing angle of the superposition
state depends on the phase jump only. For other arrangements, the superposition mixing angle is
shifted by the dynamic phases of the propagators, which makes these cases suitable for state tomography.
This twin setup comes along with the advantage that it reduces the error $\epsilon$ of each individual
pulse down to $4\epsilon^2$ overall. Therefore, the proposed technique combines the benefits
of robustness stemming from adiabatic evolution with accuracy generated by the twin-pulse error
suppression, and flexibility of the superposition state controlled by the phase jump $\phi$. In
addition, we present a simple exactly soluble trigonometric model in order to illustrate the proposed
technique. In this model, when the pulse area $A$ increases the nonadiabatic oscillations are damped
as $A^{-1}$ for a single pulse and $A^{-2}$ for the two-pulse sequence. Finally, the proposed technique
is extended to sequences of $N=2^n$ pulses by concatenating $\pi/2$ sequences and splitting them
by a phase jump, thereby further reducing the nonadiabatic error $\epsilon$ to $(2\epsilon)^{N}$.
This makes the proposed technique suitable for generating high-fidelity quantum rotation gates.
