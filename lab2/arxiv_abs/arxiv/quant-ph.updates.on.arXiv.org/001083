Significant resources are now being devoted to develop intermediate scale quantum systems with
tens of quantum bits, tunable interactions, and independent control of each element. Ion traps,
superconducting circuits, tweezer arrays of neutral atoms, and other systems have made exciting
recent advances, but scaling precise quantum dynamics from few-body to many-body remains as a primary
challenge in quantum science. Instead of building up qubit-by-qubit, like the aforementioned
platforms, here we focus on a system where quantum information is stored as patterns or images inside
a single cavity-coupled atomic ensemble containing up to $10^6$ atoms. This scalability more closely
resembles, for example, that of a neural network, where data is stored and manipulated as patterns
and images rather than binary bits. We demonstrate cavity electrodynamics between multiplexed
excitations stored in a laser-cooled and trapped ensemble of atoms coupled to an optical ring cavity.
Multiplexing is achieved by applying multiple dressing laser beams, creating cavity-coupled
spin-wave excitations, that are holographic in nature. We demonstrate strong cavity interactions
with multiple spin waves and measure cavity-mediated interactions between pairs of spin waves
as a function of their holographic and spectral overlap. The current optics configuration allows
rapid, interchangeable cavity-coupling to 4 profiles with an overlap parameter of less than 10%,
enough to demonstrate, for example, a quantum repeater network simulation in the cavity. With further
improvements to the optical multiplexing setup, we infer the ability to access more than $10^3$
independent spin-wave profiles.
