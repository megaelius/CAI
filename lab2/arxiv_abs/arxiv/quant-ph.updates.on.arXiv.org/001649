For universal quantum computation, a major challenge to overcome for practical implementation
is the large amount of resources required for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.
An important aspect is implementing arbitrary unitary operators built from logical gates within
the quantum error correction code. A synthesis algorithm can be used to approximate any unitary
gate up to arbitrary precision by assembling sequences of logical gates chosen from a small set of
universal gates, which are fault-tolerantly performable while encoded in a quantum error-correction
code. However, current procedures do not yet support individual assignment of base gate cost values
and many do not support extended sets of universal base gates. We study cost-optimal sequences synthesised
from sets of base gates which include Clifford gates and $Z$-rotation gates from higher orders of
the Clifford hierarchy, which can be performed fault-tolerantly on error-correction codes using
magic state distillation protocols. The individual costs assigned are the average numbers of raw
(i.e. physical level) magic states required to implement the gates fault-tolerantly. By including
the $Z$-rotation gates from the fourth order of the Clifford hierarchy as base gates in addition
to the canonical Clifford+$T$ gates, we find that the average cost decreases by up to $30\%$. The
gate synthesis algorithm introduced in this work, based on Dijkstra's algorithm, generates cost-optimal
sequences for single-qubit target gates and supports arbitrary universal sets of single-qubit
base gates with individually assigned cost values. In addition, we develop an analytic model to
estimate the proportion of sets of $Z$-rotation gates from higher orders of the Clifford hierarchy
among gates within sequences approximating random target gates, which can be used to estimate each
order's effectiveness for the purpose of gate synthesis.
