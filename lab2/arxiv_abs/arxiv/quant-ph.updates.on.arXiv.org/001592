One of the most important algorithmic applications of quantum walks is to solve spatial search problems.
A widely used quantum algorithm for this problem, introduced by Childs and Goldstone [Phys. Rev.
A 70, 022314 (2004)], finds a marked node on a graph of $n$ nodes via a continuous-time quantum walk.
This algorithm is said to be optimal if it can find any of the nodes in $O(\sqrt{n})$ time. However,
given a graph, no general conditions for the optimality of the algorithm are known and previous works
demonstrating optimal quantum search for certain graphs required an instance-specific analysis.
In fact, the demonstration of necessary and sufficient conditions a graph must fulfill for quantum
search to be optimal has been a long-standing open problem. In this work, we make significant progress
towards solving this problem. We derive general expressions, depending on the spectral properties
of the Hamiltonian driving the walk, that predict the performance of this quantum search algorithm
provided certain spectral conditions are fulfilled. Our predictions are valid, for example, for
(normalized) Hamiltonians whose spectral gap is considerably larger than $n^{-1/2}$. This allows
us to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal quantum search in this regime, as well
as provide new examples of graphs where quantum search is sub-optimal. In addition, by extending
this analysis, we are also able to show the optimality of quantum search for certain graphs with very
small spectral gaps, such as graphs that can be efficiently partitioned into clusters. Our results
imply that, to the best of our knowledge, all prior results analytically demonstrating the optimality
of this algorithm for specific graphs can be recovered from our general results.
