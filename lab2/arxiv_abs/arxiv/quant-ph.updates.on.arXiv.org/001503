Realistic models of quantum systems must include dissipative interactions with an environment.
For weakly-damped systems the Lindblad-form Markovian master equation is invaluable for this
task due to its tractability and efficiency. This equation only applies, however, when the frequencies
of any subset of the system's transitions are either equal (degenerate), or their differences are
much greater than the transitions' linewidths (far-detuned). Outside of these two regimes the
only available efficient description has been the Bloch-Redfield (B-R) master equation, the efficacy
of which has long been controversial due to its failure to guarantee the positivity of the density
matrix. The ability to efficiently simulate weakly-damped systems across all regimes is becoming
increasingly important, especially in the area of quantum technologies. Here we solve this long-standing
problem. We discover that a condition on the slope of the spectral density is sufficient to derive
a Lindblad form master equation that is accurate for all regimes. We further show that this condition
is necessary for weakly-damped systems to be described by the B-R equation or indeed any Markovian
master equation. We thus obtain a replacement for the B-R equation over its entire domain of applicability
that is no less accurate, simpler in structure, completely positive, allows simulation by efficient
quantum trajectory methods, and unifies the previous Lindblad master equations. We also show via
exact simulations that the new master equation can describe systems in which slowly-varying transition
frequencies cross each other during the evolution. System identification tools, developed in
systems engineering, play an important role in our analysis. We expect these tools to prove useful
in other areas of physics involving complex systems.
