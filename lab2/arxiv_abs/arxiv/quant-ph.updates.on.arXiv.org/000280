A first quantized free photon is a complex massless vector field $A=(A^\mu)$ whose field strength
satisfies Maxwell's equations in vacuum. We construct the Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$ of the photon
by endowing the vector space of the fields $A$ in the temporal-Coulomb gauge with a positive-definite
and relativistically invariant inner product. We give an explicit expression for this inner product,
identify the Hamiltonian for the photon with the generator of time translations in $\mathscr{H}$,
determine the operators representing the momentum and the helicity of the photon, and introduce
a chirality operator whose eigenfunctions correspond to fields having a definite sign of energy.
We also construct a position operator for the photon whose components commute with each other and
with the chirality and helicity operators. This allows for the construction of the localized states
of the photon with a definite sign of energy and helicity. We derive an explicit formula for the latter
and compute the corresponding electric and magnetic fields. These turn out to diverge not just at
the point where the photon is localized but on a plane containing this point. We identify the axis
normal to this plane with an associated symmetry axis, and show that each choice of this axis specifies
a particular position operator, a corresponding position basis, and a position representation
of the quantum mechanics of photon. In particular, we examine the position wave functions determined
by such a position basis, elucidate their relationship with the Riemann-Silberstein and Landau-Peierls
wave functions, and give an explicit formula for the probability density of the spatial localization
of the photon.
