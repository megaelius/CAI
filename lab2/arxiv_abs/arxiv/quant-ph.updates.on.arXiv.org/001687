Key distribution protocols allow the secure distribution of cryptographic key material amongst
two parties, Alice and Bob. If these protocol exploit quantum mechanical properties they are referred
to as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols. QKD protocols can be shown to be information theoretically
secure. However, implementing these protocols requires the manipulation and communication of
quantum information, which raises a number of challenges. The measurement or detection devices
in QKD implementations are very sensitive and the slightest deviations from the theoretical behavior
can results in erroneous results. Moreover, quantum communication channels are subject to significant
losses. For these reasons, it is challenging to evaluate QKD protocols over large distances and
optimizing the performance of a QKD implementation is an important task. In this work we consider
the performance optimization of the Decoy-State BB84 QKD protocol, i.e., finding optimal protocol
parameters. This optimization problem requires a security analysis and a physical model for the
different components of the implementation. To simplify the analysis and optimization problem,
various heuristic assumptions are typically made. We follow a more rigorous approach and formally
describe the linear and non-linear programs describing the optimization problem. As a result we
are able to omit a number of heuristic assumptions and improve the performance of the Decoy-State
BB84 QKD protocol by instantiating it with optimized protocol parameter. We show that some of these
assumptions are too restrictive and limit the achievable performance.
