The complementarity between time and energy, as well as between an angle and a component of angular
momentum, is described at three different layers of understanding. The phenomena of super-resolution
are readily apparent in the quantum phase representation which also reveals that entanglement
is not required. We modify Schwinger's harmonic oscillator model of angular momentum to include
the case of photons. Therein the quantum angle measurement is shown to be equivalent to the measurement
of the relative phase between the two oscillators. Two reasonable ways of dealing with degeneracy
are shown to correspond to: a conditional measurement which takes a snapshot in absolute time (corresponding
to adding probability amplitudes); and a marginal measurement which takes an average in absolute
time (corresponding to adding probabilities). The sense in which distinguishability is a "matter
of how long we look" is discussed and the meaning of the general theory is illustrated by taking the
two oscillators to be circularly polarized photons. It is shown that an odd number of x-polarized
photons will never have an angle in correspondence with the y-axis; but an even number of x-polarized
photons always can! The behavior of an x-polarized coherent state is examined and the snapshot angular
distributions are seen to evolve into two counter-rotating peaks resulting in considerable correspondence
with the y-axis at the time for which a classical linear polarization vector would shrink to zero
length. We also demonstrate how the probability distribution of absolute time (herein a measurable
quantity, rather than just a parameter) has an influence on how these snapshot angular distributions
evolve into a quantum version of the polarization ellipse.
