Quantum information protocols can be realized using the `prepare and measure' setups which do not
require sharing quantum correlated particles. In this work, we study the equivalence between the
quantumness in a prepare and measure scenario involving independent devices, which implements
quantum random number generation, and the quantumness in the corresponding scenario which realizes
the same task with spatially separated correlated particles. In particular, we demonstrate that
quantumness of sequential correlations observed in the prepare and measure scenario gets manifested
as superunsteerability, which is a particular kind of spatial quantum correlation in the presence
of limited shared randomness. In this scenario consisting of spatially separated quantum correlated
particles as resource for implementing the quantum random number generation protocol, we define
an experimentally measurable quantity which provides a bound on the amount of genuine randomness
generation. Next, we study the equivalence between the quantumness of the prepare and measure scenario
in the presence of shared randomness, which has been used for implementing quantum random-access
codes, and the quantumness in the corresponding scenario which replaces quantum communication
by spatially separated quantum correlated particles. In this case, we demonstrate that certain
sequential correlations in the prepare and measure scenario in the presence of shared randomness,
which have quantumness but do not provide advantage for random-access codes, can be used to provide
advantage when they are realized as spatial correlations in the presence of limited shared randomness.
We point out that these spatial correlations are superlocal correlations, which are another kind
of spatial quantum correlations in the presence of limited shared randomness, and identify inequalities
detecting superlocality.
