We present a unified field theory of wave and particle in quantum mechanics. This emerges from an
investigation of two weaknesses in the de Broglie-Bohm (deBB) theory: its reliance on the quantum
probability formula to justify the particle law and its insouciance regarding the absence of reciprocal
action of the particle on the guiding wave. These problems are resolved within an analytical framework
by requiring that the wave-particle composite exhibits no observable differences with a quantum
system. This scheme is implemented by appealing to symmetries (global gauge and spacetime translations)
and imposing equality of the corresponding conserved Noether densities (matter, momentum and
energy) with their Schrodinger counterparts. In conjunction with the condition of time reversal
covariance this implies the deBB law for the particle where the quantum potential mediates the wave-particle
interaction (we also show how the time reversal assumption may be replaced by a statistical condition).
The method clarifies several aspects of the deBB theory: the mass of the composite; the energy-momentum
conservation laws; and computing the trajectory using the Jacobi law. Our principal result is the
unification of the Schrodinger equation and the deBB law in an inhomogeneous equation whose solution
amalgamates the wavefunction and a singular soliton model of the particle in a unified spacetime
field. The wavefunction suffers no reaction from the particle since it is the homogeneous part of
the unified field to whose source the particle contributes. The theory applies to many-body systems.
We review the objections of de Broglie to the pilot-wave theory and show that our field-theoretic
description provides a realization of his hitherto unfulfilled double-solution programme. A
revised set of postulates for the deBB theory is given in which the unified field is taken as the basic
descriptive element.
