Background: Breakup reactions are often used to probe the nuclear structure of halo nuclei. The
eikonal model diverges for Coulomb breakup since it relies on the adiabatic approximation. To correct
this weakness, a Coulomb-corrected eikonal method (CCE) using the Coulomb first-order-perturbation
approximation was developed. Purpose: Since the CCE mixes two reaction models and treats the Coulomb
and nuclear interactions on different footings, we study here an alternative approach. We develop
a simplification to the dynamical eikonal approximation (S-DEA) which has a similar numerical
cost as the usual eikonal model, and study its efficiency for both nuclear- and Coulomb-dominated
breakup reactions. Results: The S-DEA leads to precise energy distributions for both breakup reactions.
The corresponding parallel-momentum distributions obtained with the S-DEA are improved compared
to the ones computed with the eikonal model. It is more efficient for nuclear-dominated breakup
than the CCE since it reproduces better the shape and magnitude of the distribution. However, for
the Coulomb breakup, the distribution lacks asymmetry. Conclusions: The simplification of the
DEA developed in this work improves significantly the eikonal descriptions of breakup energy distribution
for both Coulomb- and nuclear-dominated reactions. The asymmetry of the parallel-momentum distribution
is enhanced for nuclear-dominated breakup. This study confirms that the asymmetry of parallel-momentum
distribution is due to dynamical effects. A direct prospect of this work would be to extend this model
to two-neutron halo-nucleus projectiles.
