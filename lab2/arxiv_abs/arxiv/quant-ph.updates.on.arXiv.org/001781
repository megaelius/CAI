One of the major application areas of interest for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers
is the optimization of classical objective functions. In this work, we develop intuitive constructions
for a large class of these algorithms based on connections to simple dynamics of quantum systems,
quantum walks, and classical continuous relaxations. We focus on developing a language and tools
connected with kinetic energy on a graph for understanding the physical mechanisms of success and
failure to guide algorithmic improvement. This physical language, in combination with uniqueness
results related to unitarity, allow us to identify some potential pitfalls from kinetic energy
fundamentally opposing the goal of optimization. This is connected to effects from wavefunction
confinement, phase randomization, and shadow defects lurking in the objective far away from the
ideal solution. As an example, we explore the surprising deficiency of many quantum methods in solving
uncoupled spin problems and how this is both predictive of performance on some more complex systems
while immediately suggesting simple resolutions. Further examination of canonical problems
like the Hamming ramp or bush of implications show that entanglement can be strictly detrimental
to performance results from the underlying mechanism of solution in approaches like QAOA. Kinetic
energy and graph Laplacian perspectives provide new insights to common initialization and optimal
solutions in QAOA as well as new methods for more effective layerwise training. Connections to classical
methods of continuous extensions, homotopy methods, and iterated rounding suggest new directions
for research in quantum optimization. Throughout, we unveil many pitfalls and mechanisms in quantum
optimization using a physical perspective, which aim to spur the development of novel quantum optimization
algorithms and refinements.
