We study the complexity of computing the commuting-operator value $\omega^*$ of entangled XOR
games with any number of players. We introduce necessary and sufficient criteria for an XOR game
to have $\omega^* = 1$, and use these criteria to derive the following results: 1. An algorithm for
symmetric games that decides in polynomial time whether $\omega^* = 1$ or $\omega^* < 1$, a task that
was not previously known to be decidable, together with a simple tensor-product strategy that achieves
value 1 in the former case. The only previous candidate algorithm for this problem was the Navascu\'{e}s-Pironio-Ac\'{i}n
(also known as noncommutative Sum of Squares or ncSoS) hierarchy, but no convergence bounds were
known. 2. A family of games with three players and with $\omega^* < 1$, where it takes doubly exponential
time for the ncSoS algorithm to witness this (in contrast with our algorithm which runs in polynomial
time). 3. A family of games achieving a bias difference $2(\omega^* - \omega)$ arbitrarily close
to the maximum possible value of $1$ (and as a consequence, achieving an unbounded bias ratio), answering
an open question of Bri\"{e}t and Vidick. 4. Existence of an unsatisfiable phase for random (non-symmetric)
XOR games: that is, we show that there exists a constant $C_k^{\text{unsat}}$ depending only on
the number $k$ of players, such that a random $k$-XOR game over an alphabet of size $n$ has $\omega^*
< 1$ with high probability when the number of clauses is above $C_k^{\text{unsat}} n$. 5. A lower
bound of $\Omega(n \log(n)/\log\log(n))$ on the number of levels in the ncSoS hierarchy required
to detect unsatisfiability for most random 3-XOR games. This is in contrast with the classical case
where the $n$-th level of the sum-of-squares hierarchy is equivalent to brute-force enumeration
of all possible solutions.
