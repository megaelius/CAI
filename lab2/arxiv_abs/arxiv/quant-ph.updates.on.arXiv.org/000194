One of the most important questions in quantum information theory is the so-called separability
problem. It involves characterizing the set of separable (or, equivalently entangled) states
among mixed states of a multipartite quantum system. In this thesis we study the generalization
of this problem to types of quantum correlations that are defined in a manner analogous to entanglement.
We start with the subset of set of pure states of a given quantum system and call states belonging to
the convex hull of this subset "non-correlated" states. Consequently, the states laying outside
the convex hull are referred to as "correlated". In this work we focus on cases when there exist a symmetry
group that preserves the class of "non-correlated" pure states. The presence of symmetries allows
to obtain a unified treatment of many types of seemingly unrelated types of correlations. We apply
our general results to particular types of correlations: (i) entanglement of distinguishable
particles, (ii) particle entanglement of bosons, (iii) "entanglement" of fermions, (iv) non-convex-Gaussian
correlations in fermionic systems, (v) genuine multiparty entanglement, and finally (vi) refined
notions of bipartite entanglement based on the concept of the Schmidt number. We investigate the
natural problems and questions concerning the correlations defined above: (I) We provide explicit
polynomial characterization of various types of correlations for pure states. (II) We examine
cases in which it is possible to give a complete analytical characterization of correlated mixed
states. (III) We derive a variety of polynomial criteria for detection of correlations in mixed
states.(IV) We use the above criteria and the technique of measure concentration to study typical
properties of correlations on sets of isospectral density matrices.
