Schroedinger's famous thought experiment involves a (macroscopic) cat whose quantum state becomes
entangled with that of a (microscopic) decaying nucleus. The creation of such micro-macro entanglement
is currently being pursued in several fields, including atomic ensembles, superconducting circuits,
electro-mechanical and opto-mechanical systems. For purely optical systems, there have been
several proposals to create micro-macro entanglement by greatly amplifying one half of an initial
microscopic entangled state of light, but experimental attempts have so far been inconclusive.
Here we experimentally demonstrate micro-macro entanglement of light. The macro system involves
over a hundred million photons, while the micro system is at the single-photon level. We show that
microscopic differences (in field quadrature measurements) on one side are correlated with macroscopic
differences (in the photon number variance) on the other side. On the other hand, we demonstrate
entanglement by bringing the macroscopic state back to the single-photon level and performing
full quantum state tomography of the final state. Our results show that it is possible to create and
demonstrate micro-macro entanglement for unexpectedly large photon numbers. Schroedinger's
thought experiment was originally intended to convey the absurdity of applying quantum mechanics
to macroscopic objects. Today many quantum physicists believe that quantum principles in fact
apply on all scales. By combining the present approach with other (e.g. mechanical) systems, or
by applying its basic ideas in different contexts, it may be possible to bring quantum effects ever
closer to our everyday experience.
