The evolution of a quantum system towards thermal equilibrium is usually studied by approximate
methods, which have their limits of validity and should be checked against analytically solvable
models. In this paper, we propose an analytically solvable model to investigate the energy transfer
between a bosonic bath and a fermionic chain which are nonlinearly-coupled to each other. The bosonic
bath consists of an infinite collection of non-interacting bosonic modes, while the fermionic
chain is represented by a chain of interacting fermions with nearest-neighbor interactions. We
compare behaviors of the temperature-dependent energy current $J_{T}$ and temperature-independent
energy current $J_{TI}$ for different bath configurations. With respect to the bath spectrum,
$J_{T}$ decays exponentially for Lorentz-Drude type bath, which is the same as the conventional
approximations. On the other hand, the decay rate is $1/t^{3}$ for Ohmic type and $1/t$ for white
noise, which doesn't have conventional counterparts. For the temperature-independent current
$J_{TI}$, the decay rate is divergent for the Lorentz-Drude type bath, $1/t^{4}$ for the Ohmic bath,
and $1/t$ for the white noise. When further considering the dynamics of the fermionic chain, the
current will be modulated based on the envelope from the bath. As an example, for a bosonic bath with
Ohmic spectrum, when the fermionic chain is uniformly-coupled, we have $J_{T}\propto1/t^{6}$
and $J_{TI}\propto1/t^{3}$. Remarkably, for perfect state transfer (PST) couplings, there always
exists an oscillating quantum energy current $J_{TI}$. Moreover, it is interesting that $J_{T}$
is proportional to $(N-1)^{1/2}$ at certain times for PST couplings under Lorentz-Drude or Ohmic
bath.
