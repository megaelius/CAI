In an open quantum system, we study the evolution of a two-level atom as a detector which interacts
with given environments. For a uniformly accelerated two-level atom coupled to a massless scalar
field in the Minkowski vacuum, when it evolves for a certain time, we find that there exists a peak
value for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of acceleration, which indicates that the optimal
precision of estimation is achieved when choosing an appropriate acceleration $a$. QFI has different
behaviors for different initial state parameters $\theta$ of the atom, displaying periodicity.
However, the periodicity fades away with the evolution of time, which means that the initial state
cannot affect the later stable quantum state. Furthermore, adding a boundary, we observe that the
peak value of QFI increases when the atom is close to the boundary, which shows that QFI is protected
by the boundary. Here, QFI fluctuates, and there may exist two peak values with a certain moment,
which expands the detection range of the acceleration. Therefore, we can enhance the estimation
precision of acceleration by choosing an appropriate position and acceleration $a$. The periodicity
of QFI with respect to the initial state parameter $\theta$ lasts a longer time than the previous
unbounded case, which indicates that the initial state is protected by the boundary. Finally, for
a thermal bath with a boundary, QFI of temperature has no more than one peak value with a certain moment,
which is different from QFI of acceleration with a boundary. The periodicity also lasts a longer
time than unbounded case, which shows the initial quantum state of the atom is protected by the boundary
for two cases.
