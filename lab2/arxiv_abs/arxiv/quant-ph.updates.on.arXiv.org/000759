The von Neumann entropy plays a vital role in quantum information theory. The von Neumann entropy
determines, e.g., the capacities of quantum channels. Also, entropies of composite quantum systems
are important for future quantum networks, and their characterization is related to the quantum
marginal problem. Furthermore, they play a role in quantum thermodynamics. In this thesis the set
of quantum entropies of multipartite quantum systems is studied. The problem of its characterization
is not new -- however, progress has been sparse, indicating that the problem might be hard and that
new methods might be needed. Here, a variety of different and complementary approaches are taken.
First, I look at global properties. It is known that the von Neumann entropy region -- just like its
classical counterpart -- forms a convex cone. I describe the symmetries of this cone and highlight
geometric similarities and differences to the classical entropy cone. In a different approach,
I utilize the local geometric properties of extremal rays of a cone. I show that quantum states whose
entropy lies on such an extremal ray of the quantum entropy cone have a very simple structure. As the
set of all quantum states is very complicated, I look at a simple subset called stabilizer states.
I improve on previously known results by showing that under a technical condition on the local dimension,
entropies of stabilizer states respect an additional class of information inequalities that is
valid for random variables from linear codes. In a last approach I find a representation-theoretic
formulation of the classical marginal problem simplifying the comparison with its quantum mechanical
counterpart. This novel correspondence yields a simplified formulation of the group characterization
of classical entropies (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 48(7):1992-1995, 2002) in purely combinatorial
terms.
