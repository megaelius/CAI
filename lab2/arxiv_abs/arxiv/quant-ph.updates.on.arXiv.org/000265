Random quantum circuits yield minimally structured models for chaotic quantum dynamics, able
to capture for example universal properties of entanglement growth. We provide exact results and
coarse-grained models for the spreading of operators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries.
We study both 1+1D and higher dimensions, and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over
to operator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that the out-of-time-order
correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation, which gives exact results for the spatial
profile of the OTOC, and the butterfly speed $v_{B}$. We find that in 1+1D the `front' of the OTOC broadens
diffusively, with a width scaling in time as $t^{1/2}$. We address fluctuations in the OTOC between
different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that they are negligible in comparison to
the broadening of the front. Turning to higher D, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood
exactly via a remarkable correspondence with a classical droplet growth problem. This implies
that the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as $t^{1/3}$ in 2+1D and $t^{0.24}$ in 3+1D
(KPZ exponents). We support our analytic argument with simulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in
a lattice model, the late time shape of the spreading operator is in general not spherical. However
when full spatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact asymptotic
form for the OTOC in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an alternative perspective on the
OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition function of an Ising-like model. As a result of special structure
arising from unitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which can
be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for entanglement growth in 1+1D
circuits.
