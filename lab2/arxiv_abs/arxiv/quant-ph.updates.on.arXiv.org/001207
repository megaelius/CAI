The most general quantum object that can be shared between two distant parties is a bipartite quantum
channel. In general, bipartite channels can produce entangled states, and can be used to simulate
quantum operations that are not local. When the input dimensions are trivial, a bipartite channel
can be viewed as a bipartite state, and when the output systems are classical the channel can be viewed
as a bipartite POVM. While much effort over the last two decades has been devoted to the study of entanglement
of bipartite states, very little is known about the entanglement of bipartite channels. In this
work, for the first time we rigorously study the entanglement of bipartite channels. We follow a
top-down approach, starting from general resource theories of processes, for which we present
a new construction of a complete family of monotones, valid in all resource theories where the set
of free superchannels is convex. In this setting, we define various general resource-theoretic
protocols and resource monotones, which are then applied to the case of entanglement of bipartite
channels. We focus in particular on the resource theory of PPT entanglement. In our definition of
PPT superchannels we do not assume that they be realized by pre- and post-PPT channels. This leads
to a greater mathematical simplicity that allows us to express all resource protocols and monotones
in terms of semi-definite programs. Along the way, we generalize the negativity measure to bipartite
channels, and show that another monotone, the max-logarithmic-negativity, has an operational
interpretation as the exact asymptotic entanglement cost of a bipartite channel. Finally, we show
that it is not possible to distill entanglement out of bipartite PPT channels under any set of free
superchannels that can be used in entanglement theory, leading us in particular to the discovery
of bound entangled POVMs.
