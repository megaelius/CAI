The device-independent approach to physics is one where conclusions are drawn directly from the
observed correlations between measurement outcomes. In quantum information, this approach allows
one to make strong statements about the properties of the underlying systems or devices solely via
the observation of Bell-inequality-violating correlations. However, since one can only perform
a {\em finite number} of experimental trials, statistical fluctuations necessarily accompany
any estimation of these correlations. Consequently, an important gap remains between the many
theoretical tools developed for the asymptotic scenario and the experimentally obtained raw data.
In particular, a physical and concurrently practical way to estimate the underlying quantum distribution
has so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the natural analogs of the maximum-likelihood estimation
technique and the least-square-error estimation technique in the device-independent context
result in point estimates of the true distribution that are physical, unique, computationally
tractable and consistent. They thus serve as sound algorithmic tools allowing one to bridge the
aforementioned gap. As an application, we demonstrate how such estimates of the underlying quantum
distribution can be used to provide, in certain cases, trustworthy estimates of the amount of entanglement
present in the measured system. In stark contrast to existing approaches to device-independent
parameter estimations, our estimation does not require the prior knowledge of {\em any} Bell inequality
tailored for the specific property and the specific distribution of interest.
