Coupling an isolated emitter to a single mode of the electromagnetic field is now routinely achieved
and well understood. Current efforts aim to explore the coherent dynamics of emitters coupled to
several electromagnetic modes (EM). freedom. Recently, ultrastrong coupling to a transmission
line has been achieved where the emitter resonance broadens to a significant fraction of its frequency.
In this work we gain significantly improved control over this regime. We do so by combining the simplicity
of a transmon qubit and a bespoke EM environment with a high density of discrete modes, hosted inside
a superconducting metamaterial. This produces a unique device in which the hybridisation between
the qubit and up to 10 environmental modes can be monitored directly. Moreover the frequency and
broadening of the qubit resonance can be tuned independently of each other in situ. We experimentally
demonstrate that our device combines this tunability with ultrastrong coupling and a qubit nonlinearity
comparable to the other relevant energy scales in the system. We also develop a quantitative theoretical
description that does not contain any phenomenological parameters and that accurately takes into
account vacuum fluctuations of our large scale quantum circuit in the regime of ultrastrong coupling
and intermediate non-linearity. The demonstration of this new platform combined with a quantitative
modelling brings closer the prospect of experimentally studying many-body effects in quantum
optics. A limitation of the current device is the intermediate nonlinearity of the qubit. Pushing
it further will induce fully developed many-body effects, such as a giant Lamb shift or nonclassical
states of multimode optical fields. Observing such effects would establish interesting links
between quantum optics and the physics of quantum impurities.
