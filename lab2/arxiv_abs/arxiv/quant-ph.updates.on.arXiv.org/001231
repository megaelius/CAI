As the advances in quantum hardware bring us into the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era,
one possible task we can perform without quantum error correction using NISQ machines is the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE) due to its shallow depth. A specific problem that we can tackle is the strongly
interacting Fermi-Hubbard model, which is classically intractable and has practical implications
in areas like superconductivity. In this Article, we will perform resource estimation on Hubbard
VQE using silicon spin qubits as our example platform, though many of our arguments can be extended
to other hardware platforms like superconducting qubits, trapped-ion qubits, etc. We outline
the details about the gate sequence, the measurement scheme and the relevant error mitigation techniques
for the implementation of the Hubbard VQE on a NISQ platform. For a 50-qubit simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard
model, which cannot be solved exactly via classical means, we need $\sim 40000$ gates, which means
that we need a gate infidelity of $10^{-4}$ to obtain meaningful results with the aid of error mitigations.
When searching for the ground state presuming a $\mu s$ gate time, the time required for one time step
in gradient descent is $\sim 6 \text{ days}$, which can be reduced to less than $10$ minutes if we distribute
our task among 1000 quantum processors. Hence, implementing a 50-qubit Hubbard model VQE on a NISQ
machine can be on the brink of being feasible in near term, but further optimisation of our simulation
scheme, improvements in the gate fidelity, improvements in the optimisation scheme and advances
in the error mitigation techniques are needed to overcome the remaining obstacles. The scalability
of the hardware platform is also essential to overcome the runtime issue via parallelisation.
