Given a Bell inequality, if its maximal quantum violation can be achieved only by a single set of measurements
for each party or a single quantum state, up to local unitaries, one refers to such a phenomenon as
"self-testing". For instance, the maximal quantum violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality certifies that the underlying state contains the two-qubit maximally entangled state
and the measurements of one party (say, Alice) contains a pair of anti-commuting qubit observables.
As a consequence, the other party (say, Bob) automatically verifies his set of states remotely steered
by Alice, namely the "assemblage", is in the eigenstates of a pair of anti-commuting observables.
It is natural to ask if the quantum violation of the Bell inequality is not maximally achieved, are
we capable of estimating how close the underlying assemblage is to the reference one? In this work,
we provide a systematic device-independent estimation by proposing a framework called "robust
self-testing of steerable quantum assemblages". In particular, we consider assemblages violating
several paradigmatic Bell inequalities and obtain the robust self-testing statement for each
scenario. Our result is device-independent (DI), i.e., no assumption is made on the shared state
and the measurement devices involved. Our work thus not only paves a way for exploring the connection
between the boundary of quantum set of correlations and steerable assemblages, but also provides
a useful tool in the areas of DI quantum certification. As two explicit applications, we show 1) that
it can be used for an alternative proof of the protocol of DI certification of all entangled states
proposed by Bowles et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 180503 (2018)], and 2) that it can be used to verify
all non-entanglement-breaking channels with fewer assumptions compared with the work of Rosset
et al. [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021033 (2018)].
