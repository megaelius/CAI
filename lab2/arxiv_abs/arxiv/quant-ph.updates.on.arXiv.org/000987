We start with the task of discriminating finitely many multipartite quantum states using LOCC protocols,
with the goal to optimize the probability of correctly identifying the state. We provide two different
methods to show that finitely many measurement outcomes in every step are sufficient for approaching
the optimal probability of discrimination. In the first method, each measurement of an optimal
LOCC protocol, applied to a $d_{\rm loc}$-dim local system, is replaced by one with at most $2d_{\rm
loc}^2$ outcomes, without changing the probability of success. In the second method, we decompose
any LOCC protocol into a convex combination of a number of "slim protocols" in which each measurement
applied to a $d_{\rm loc}$-dim local system has at most $d_{\rm loc}^2$ outcomes. To maximize any
convex functions in LOCC (including the probability of state discrimination or fidelity of state
transformation), an optimal protocol can be replaced by the best slim protocol in the convex decomposition
without using shared randomness. For either method, the bound on the number of outcomes per measurement
is independent of the global dimension, the number of parties, the depth of the protocol, how deep
the measurement is located, and applies to LOCC protocols with infinite rounds, and the "measurement
compression" can be done "top-down" -- independent of later operations in the LOCC protocol. The
second method can be generalized to implement LOCC instruments with finitely many outcomes: if
the instrument has $n$ coarse-grained final measurement outcomes, global input dimension $D_0$
and global output dimension $D_i$ for $i=1,...,n$ conditioned on the $i$-th outcome, then one can
obtain the instrument as a convex combination of no more than $R=\sum_{i=1}^n D_0^2 D_i^2 - D_0^2
+ 1$ slim protocols; in other words, $\log_2 R$ bits of shared randomess suffice.
