Some of the most sensitive and precise measurements to date are based on matterwave interferometry
with freely falling atomic clouds. Examples include high-precision measurements of inertia,
gravity and rotation. In order to achieve these very high sensitivities, the interrogation time
has to be very long and consequently the experimental apparatus has to be very tall, in some cases
reaching ten or even one hundred meters. Cancelling gravitational acceleration, e.g. in atomtronic
circuits6,7 and matterwave guides, will result in compact devices having much extended interrogation
times and thus much increased sensitivity both for fundamental and practical measurements. In
this letter, we demonstrate extremely smooth and controllable matterwave guides by transporting
Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) over macroscopic distances: We use a novel neutral-atom accelerator
ring to bring BECs to very high speeds (16x their velocity of sound) and transport them in a magnetic
matterwave guide for 15 cm whilst fully preserving their internal coherence. The high angular momentum
of more than 40000h per atom gives access to the higher Landau levels of quantum Hall states. The hypersonic
velocities combined with our ability to control the potentials with pico-Kelvin precision open
new perspectives in the study of superfluidity and give rise to new regimes of tunnelling and transport.
Coherent matterwave guides are expected to enable interaction times of several seconds in highly
compact devices. These developments will result in portable guided-atom interferometers for
applications such as inertial navigation and gravity mapping.
