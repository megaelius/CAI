Experimental tests for assessing the physical reality of the hypothetical wave modes of quantum
vacuum with zero-point energy are of fundamental importance for quantum field theories and cosmology.
Physical effects like the Casimir effect have alternate description in terms of retarded interaction
between charged matter, due to quantum fluctuations of material dipoles. However, there are simple
quantum optical configurations where the hypothetical quantum vacuum modes seem to assume an essential
real role in the observable quantum noise of optical signals. I present the logical and theoretical
basis of a decisive test that relies on the comparisons of balanced homodyne detection with a novel
differential scheme of balanced wave-front division detection, when the two real optical beams
at the detectors are derived from one coherent beam as input. Both ideal and practical configurations
of my experimental test are discussed. Results from the experiments on balanced detection, beam
localization of optical beams, and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates are used to reach definite
conclusions against the reality of the wave modes of quantum vacuum. It is shown that the entire quantum
noise follows consistently from the state reduction of quantum superpositions of particle-number
states at the point of detection, where the quantum measurement is completed. This is consistent
with the demonstrated applications of squeezed light in interferometry and quantum metrology.
This result achieves consistency between quantum noise in quantum optics and observational cosmology
based on general relativity, by avoiding the wave modes of quantum vacuum with divergent zero-point
energy density. Generalization from the limited sphere of quantum optics to general quantum field
theories promises the complete solution to the problem of a divergent cosmological constant.
