Vacuum radiation has been the subject of theoretical study in both cosmology and condensed matter
physics for many decades. Recently there has been impressive progress in experimental realizations
as well. Here we study vacuum radiation when a field mode is driven both parametrically and by a classical
source. We find that in the Heisenberg picture the field operators of the mode undergo a Bogolyubov
transformation combined with a displacement, in the Schr\"odinger picture the oscillator evolves
from the vacuum to a squeezed coherent state. Whereas the Bogolyubov transformation is the same
as would be obtained if only the parametric drive were applied the displacement is determined by
both the parametric drive and the force. If the force is applied well after the parametric drive then
the displacement is the same as would be obtained by the action of the force alone and it is essentially
independent of $t_f$, the time lag between the application of the force and the parametric drive.
If the force is applied well before the parametric drive the displacement is found to oscillate as
a function of $t_f$. This behavior can be understood in terms of quantum interference. A rich variety
of behavior is observed for intermediate values of $t_f$. The oscillations can turn off smoothly
or grow dramatically and decrease depending on strength of the parametric drive and force and the
durations for which they are applied. The displacement depends only on the Fourier component of
the force at a single resonant frequency when the forcing and the parametric drive are well separated
in time. However for a weak parametric drive that is applied at the same time as the force we show that
the displacement responds to a broad range of frequencies of the force spectrum. Implications of
our findings for experiments are briefly discussed.
