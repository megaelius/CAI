Calculating charge transfer (CT) excitation energies with high accuracy and low computational
cost is a challenging task. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), due to its efficiency
and accuracy, has achieved great success in describing ground state problems. To extend to excited
state problems, our group recently demonstrated an approach with good numerical results to calculate
low-lying and Rydberg excitation energies of an $N$-electron system from a ground state KS or generalized
KS calculations of an $(N-1)$-electron system via its orbital energies. In present work, we explore
further the same methodology to describe CT excitations. Numerical results from this work show
that performance of conventional density functional approximations (DFAs) is not as good for CT
excitations as for other excitations, due to the delocalization error. Applying localized orbital
scaling correction (LOSC) to conventional DFAs, a recently developed method in our group to effectively
reduce the delocalization error, can improve the results. Overall, the performance of this methodology
is better than time dependant DFT (TDDFT) with conventional DFAs. In addition, it shows that results
from LOSC-DFAs in this method reach similar accuracy to other methods, such as $\Delta$SCF, $G_0W_0$
with Bethe-Salpeter equations, particle-particle random phase approximation, and even high-level
wavefunction method like CC2. Our analysis show that the correct $1/R$ trend for CT excitation can
be captured from LOSC-DFA calculations, stressing that the application of DFAs with minimal delocalization
error is essential within this methodology. This work provides an efficient way to calculate CT
excitation energies from ground state DFT.
