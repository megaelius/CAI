Understanding (and controlling) hyperfine interactions in semiconductor nanostructures is
important for fundamental studies of material properties as well as for quantum information processing
with electron, hole, and nuclear-spin states. Through a combination of first-principles density-functional
theory (DFT) and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory, we have calculated hyperfine tensors for
electrons and holes in GaAs and crystalline silicon. Accounting for relativistic effects near
the nuclear core, we find contact hyperfine interactions for electrons in GaAs that are consistent
with Knight-shift measurements performed on GaAs quantum wells and are roughly consistent with
prior estimates extrapolated from measurements on InSb. We find that a combination of DFT and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$
theory is necessary to accurately determine the contact hyperfine interaction for electrons at
a conduction-band minimum in silicon that is consistent with bulk Knight-shift measurements.
For hole spins in GaAs, the overall magnitude of the hyperfine couplings we find from DFT is consistent
with previous theory based on free-atom properties, and with heavy-hole Overhauser shifts measured
in GaAs (and InGaAs) quantum dots. In addition, we theoretically predict that the heavy-hole hyperfine
coupling to the As nuclear spins is stronger and almost purely Ising-like, while the (weaker) coupling
to the Ga nuclear spins has significant non-Ising corrections. In the case of hole spins in silicon,
we find (surprisingly) that the strength of the hyperfine interaction in the valence band is comparable
to that in the conduction band and that the hyperfine tensors are highly anisotropic (Ising-like)
in the heavy-hole subspace. These results suggest that the hyperfine coupling cannot be ruled out
as a limiting mechanism for coherence ($T_2^{\ast}$) times recently measured for heavy holes in
silicon quantum dots.
