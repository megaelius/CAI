Quantum Key Distribution, introduced in 1984 in the seminal paper of Bennett and Brassard, allows
two parties to share a common secret key in an unconditionally secure way, relying on the laws of quantum
physics. This fundamental result has opened the way to the whole field of quantum cryptography,
though the unconditional security is often proven impossible to achieve, with no-go results, for
instance, for commitments and oblivious transfer, two fundamental cryptographic primitives.
However, this celebrated key distribution protocol suffers from a very strong assumption made
on the establishment of the classical channels, which are asked to be information-theoretically
authenticated (but not secure) beforehand. In practice, to keep the unconditional security, one
does not have much of a choice but assuming to have a pre-shared key (used to authenticate the messages
with authentication codes constructed from universal hashing) in order to construct a bigger shared
secret key. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of implementing this authenticated classical
channel by the means of human-memorable passwords. We first show a series of impossibility results
forbidding the achievement of very strong security. We thus focus on everlasting security, which
is a notion introduced by M\"uller-Quade and Unruh in 2007. Such a notion achieves unconditional
security after the execution of the protocol and only reduces the power of the adversary to be computational
during the execution of the protocol, which seems quite a reasonable assumption for nowadays practical
use-cases. Finally, we adapt the simulation-based framework to the quantum setting, present a
construction of a quantum PAKE scheme based on QKD, and prove its everlasting security in this simulation-based
model.
