It has been shown that it is theoretically possible for there to exist higher-order quantum processes
in which the operations performed by separate parties cannot be ascribed a definite causal order.
Some of these processes are believed to have a physical realization in standard quantum mechanics
via coherent control of the times of the operations. A prominent example is the quantum SWITCH, which
was recently demonstrated experimentally. However, the interpretation of such experiments as
realizations of a process with indefinite causal structure as opposed to some form of simulation
of such a process has remained controversial. Where exactly are the local operations of the parties
in such an experiment? On what spaces do they act given that their times are indefinite? Can we probe
them directly rather than assume what they ought to be based on heuristic considerations? How can
we reconcile the claim that these operations really take place, each once as required, with the fact
that the structure of the presumed process implies that they cannot be part of any acyclic circuit?
Here, I offer a precise answer to these questions: the input and output systems of the operations
in such a process are generally nontrivial subsystems of Hilbert spaces that are tensor products
of Hilbert spaces associated with systems at different times---a fact that is directly experimentally
verifiable. With respect to these time-delocalized subsystems, the structure of the process is
one of a circuit with a causal cycle. I also identify a whole class of isometric processes, of which
the quantum SWITCH is a special case, that admit a physical realization on time-delocalized subsystems.
These results unveil a novel structure within quantum mechanics, which may have important implications
for physics and information processing.
