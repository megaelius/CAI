A broad class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms known as "variational algorithms" have been
proposed in the context of quantum simulation, machine learning, and combinatorial optimization
as a means of potentially achieving a quantum speedup on a near-term quantum device for a problem
of practical interest. Such algorithms use the quantum device only to prepare parameterized quantum
states and make simple measurements. A classical controller uses the measurement results to perform
an optimization of a classical function induced by a quantum observable which defines the problem.
While most prior works have considered optimization strategies based on estimating the objective
function and doing a derivative-free or finite-difference-based optimization, some recent proposals
involve directly measuring observables corresponding to the gradient of the objective function.
The measurement procedure needed requires coherence time barely longer than that needed to prepare
a trial state. We prove that strategies based on such gradient measurements can admit substantially
faster rates of convergence to the optimum in some contexts. We first introduce a natural black-box
setting for variational algorithms which we prove our results with respect to. We define a simple
class of problems for which a variational algorithm based on low-depth gradient measurements and
stochastic gradient descent converges to the optimum substantially faster than any possible strategy
based on estimating the objective function itself, and show that stochastic gradient descent is
essentially optimal for this problem. Importing known results from the stochastic optimization
literature, we also derive rigorous upper bounds on the cost of variational optimization in a convex
region when using gradient measurements in conjunction with certain stochastic gradient descent
or stochastic mirror descent algorithms.
