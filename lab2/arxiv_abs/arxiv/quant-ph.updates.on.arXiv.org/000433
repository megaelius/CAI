We consider a quantum system that is initially localized at $x_{in}$ and that is repeatedly projectively
probed with a fixed period $\tau$ at position $x_d$. We ask for the probability that the system is
detected in $x_d$ for the very first time, $F_n$, where $n$ is the number of detection attempts. We
relate the asymptotic decay and oscillations of $F_n$ with the system's energy spectrum, which
is assumed to be absolutely continuous. In particular $F_n$ is determined by the Hamiltonian's
measurement density of states (MDOS) $f(E)$ that is closely related to the density of energy states
(DOS). We find that $F_n$ decays like a power law whose exponent is determined by the power law exponent
$d_S$ of $f(E)$ around its singularities $E^*$. Our findings are analogous to the classical first
passage theory of random walks. In contrast to the classical case, the decay of $F_n$ is accompanied
by oscillations with frequencies that are determined by the singularities $E^*$. This gives rise
to critical detection periods $\tau_c$ at which the oscillations disappear. In the ordinary case
$d_S$ can be identified with the spectral dimension found in the DOS. Furthermore, the singularities
$E^*$ are the van Hove singularities of the DOS in this case. We find that the asymptotic statistics
of $F_n$ depend crucially on the initial and detection state and can be wildly different for out-of-the-ordinary
states, which is in sharp contrast to the classical theory. The properties of the first detection
probabilities can alternatively be derived from the transition amplitudes. All our results are
confirmed by numerical simulations of the tight-binding model, and of a free particle in continuous
space both with a normal and with an anomalous dispersion relation. We provide explicit asymptotic
formulae for the first detection probability in these models.
