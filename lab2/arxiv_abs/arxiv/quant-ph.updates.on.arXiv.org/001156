Surface codes based on stabilizer circuits may pave the way for large scale fault-tolerant quantum
computation. The surface code uses only single- and two-qubit gates and the error threshold falls
close to 1% for a large range of errors. Among the most promising candidates to physically implement
such circuits and codes are superconducting qubits coupled by resonators. We investigate a X and
Z stabilizing circuit realized by two data qubits, two ancillas and four resonators. The aim is to
assess the consequences of unitary evolution of the interacting system, in particular for given
stable initial states, on fidelities and error syndrome probabilities. We model the system with
a Jaynes-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and construct the low-excitation level evolution operators.
The analysis is limited to two stable input states. We assume an ideal system with perfect gates,
perfect measurements and no decoherence or leakage. Our analysis shows that the capture probabilities
after the execution of a single stabilizer round are not equal to 100%, but vary between 99.2% and
99.99%. This is caused solely by the unitary evolution of the interacting system. Two consecutive
rounds of stabilizer measurements result in capture probability values that depend heavily on
the duration of the evolution, but vary between 0% and 99%. Also due to the unitary evolution, the
final state of the data qubits leaves the the four-dimensional subspace, which results in a state
fidelity oscillating between 0 and 1. Even if an error on the qubits is captured, the correcting operation
on the qubit will not bring the qubit to the original state. The errors induced by the Hamiltonian
evolution of the system cannot be interpreted nor classified as commonly appearing errors. Additional
or augmented quantum error correction may be required to compensate these effects of resonator-qubit
interaction.
