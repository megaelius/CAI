Fluorescent nanodiamonds (fNDs) containing Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centres are promising candidates
for quantum sensing in biological environments. However, to date, there has been little progress
made to combine the sensing capabilities of fNDs with biomimetic substrates used in the laboratory
to support physiologically representative cell behaviour. This work describes the fabrication
and implementation of electrospun Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) nanofibers embedded with
fNDs for optical quantum sensing in an environment, which recapitulates the nanoscale architecture
and topography of the cell niche. A range of solutions for electrospinning was prepared by mixing
fNDs in different combinations of PLGA and it was shown that fND distribution was highly dependent
on PLGA and solvent concentrations. The formulation that produced uniformly dispersed fNDs was
identified and subsequently electrospun into nanofibers. The resulting fND nanofibers were characterised
using fluorescent microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Quantum measurements were
also performed via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and longitudinal spin relaxometry.
Time varying magnetic fields external to the fND nanofibers were detected using continuous wave
ODMR to demonstrate the sensing capability of the embedded fNDs. The potential utility of fND embedded
nanofibers for use as biosensors in physiological environments was demonstrated by their ability
to support highly viable populations of differentiated neural stem cells, a major therapeutic
population able to produce electrically active neuronal circuits. The successful acquisition
of ODMR spectra from the fNDs in the presence of live cells was also demonstrated on cultures of differentiating
neural stem cells.
