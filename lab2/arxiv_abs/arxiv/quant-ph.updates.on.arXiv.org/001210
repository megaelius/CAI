Bell inequalities are an important tool in device-independent quantum information processing
because their violation can serve as a certificate of relevant quantum properties. Probably the
best known example of a Bell inequality is due to Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH), which is
defined in the simplest scenario involving two dichotomic measurements and whose all key properties
are well understood. There have been many attempts to generalise the CHSH Bell inequality to higher-dimensional
quantum systems, however, for most of them the maximal quantum violation---the key quantity for
most device-independent applications---remains unknown. On the other hand, the constructions
for which the maximal quantum violation can be computed, do not preserve the natural property of
the CHSH inequality, namely, that the maximal quantum violation is achieved by the maximally entangled
state and measurements corresponding to mutually unbiased bases. In this work we propose a novel
family of Bell inequalities which exhibit precisely these properties, and whose maximal quantum
violation can be computed analytically. In the simplest scenario it recovers the CHSH Bell inequality.
These inequalities involve $d$ measurements settings, each having $d$ outcomes for an arbitrary
prime number $d\geq 3$. We then show that in the three-outcome case our Bell inequality can be used
to self-test the maximally entangled state of two-qutrits and three mutually unbiased bases at
each site. Yet, we demonstrate that in the case of more outcomes, their maximal violation does not
allow for self-testing in the standard sense, which motivates the definition of a new weak form of
self-testing. The ability to certify high-dimensional MUBs makes these inequalities attractive
from the device-independent cryptography point of view.
