For a practical quantum key distribution (QKD) system, parameter optimization - the choice of intensities
and probabilities of sending them - is a crucial step in gaining optimal performance, especially
when one realistically considers finite communication time. With the increasing interest in the
field to implement QKD over free-space on moving platforms, such as drones, handheld systems, and
even satellites, one needs to perform parameter optimization with low latency and with very limited
computing power. Moreover, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a highly attractive
direction of QKD could be a quantum network with multiple devices and numerous connections, which
provides a huge computational challenge for the controller that optimizes parameters for a large-scale
network. Traditionally, such an optimization relies on brute-force search, or local search algorithms,
which are computationally intensive, and will be slow on low-power platforms (which increases
latency in the system) or infeasible for even moderately large networks. In this work we present
a new method that uses a neural network to directly predict the optimal parameters for QKD systems.
We test our machine learning algorithm on hardware devices including a Raspberry Pi 3 single-board-computer
(similar devices are commonly used on drones) and a mobile phone, both of which have a power consumption
of less than 5 watts, and we find a speedup of up to 100-1000 times when compared to standard local search
algorithms. The predicted parameters are highly accurate and can preserve over 95-99% of the optimal
secure key rate. Moreover, our approach is highly general and not limited to any specific QKD protocol.
