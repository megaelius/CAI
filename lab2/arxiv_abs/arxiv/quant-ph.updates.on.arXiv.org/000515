In this work, we consider a new type of Fourier-like representation of boolean function $f:\{+1,-1\}^n\to\{+1,-1\}$\[f(x)=\cos\left(\pi\sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\phi_S\prod_{i\in
S}x_i\right).\]This representation, which we call the periodic Fourier representation, of boolean
function is closely related to a certain type of multipartite Bell inequalities and non-adaptive
measurement-based quantum computation with linear side-processing ($\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$).
The minimum number of non-zero coefficients in the above representation, which we call the periodic
Fourier sparsity, is equal to the number of qubits required for the exact computation of $f$ by $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$.
Periodic Fourier representations are not unique, and can be directly obtained both from the Fourier
representation and the $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomial representation. In this work, we first show
that boolean functions related to $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$-polynomial have small periodic
Fourier sparsities. From this construction, we obtain a cubic improvement of periodic Fourier
sparsity compared to other periodic Fourier representations obtained by the Fourier representation
and the $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomial representation. This cubic improvement is currently the largest
known improvement. We also show that $\mathsf{Mod}^3_n$ and $\mathsf{Maj}_n$ have exponential
periodic Fourier sparsities. Furthermore, we show that $\mathsf{AND}_n$, $\mathsf{Mod}^3_n$
and $\mathsf{Maj}_n$ can be exactly computed by depth-2 $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$ using polynomial
number of qubits, that implies exponential gaps between $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$ and depth-2 $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$.
For arbitrary given $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$ using polynomial number of qubits, there is generally
no $\mathsf{AC^0_\oplus}$ circuit whose output is in a support of the given $\mathrm{NMQC}_\oplus$
since $\mathsf{AC^0_\oplus}$ circuit cannot compute $\mathsf{Maj}_n$.
