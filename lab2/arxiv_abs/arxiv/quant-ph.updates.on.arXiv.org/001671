Quantum communication has been leading the way of many remarkable theoretical results and experimental
tests in physics. In this context, quantum communication complexity (QCC) has recently drawn earnest
research attention as a tool to optimize the amounts of transmitted qubits and energy that are required
to implement distributed computational tasks. On this matter, we introduce a novel multi-user
quantum fingerprinting protocol that is ready to be implemented with existing technology. Particularly,
we extend to the multi-user framework a well-known two-user coherent-state fingerprinting scheme.
This generalization is highly non-trivial for a twofold reason, as it requires not only to extend
the set of protocol rules but also to specify a procedure for designing the optical devices intended
for the generalized protocol. Much of the importance of our work arises from the fact that the obtained
QCC figures of merit allow direct comparison with the best-known classical multi-user fingerprinting
protocol, of significance in the field of computer technologies and networking. Furthermore,
as one of the main contributions of the manuscript, we deduce innovative analytical upper bounds
on the amount of transmitted quantum information that are even valid in the two-user protocol as
a particular case. Ultimately, comparative results are provided to contrast different protocol
implementation strategies and, importantly, to show that, under realistic circumstances, the
multi-user protocol can achieve tasks that are impossible by using classical communication alone.
Our work provides relevant contributions towards understanding the nature and the limitations
of quantum fingerprinting and, on a broader scope, also the limitations and possibilities of quantum-communication
networks embracing a node that is accessed by multiple users at the same time.
