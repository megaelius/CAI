Background: Breakup reactions are often used to probe the nuclear structure of halo nuclei. The
eikonal model diverges for Coulomb breakup since it relies on the adiabatic approximation. To correct
this weakness, a Coulomb-corrected eikonal method (CCE) using the Coulomb first-order-perturbation
approximation was developed. Purpose: Since the CCE mixes two reaction models and treats the Coulomb
and nuclear interactions on different footings, we study here an alternative approach. We develop
a simplification to the dynamical eikonal approximation (S-DEA) which has a similar numerical
cost as the usual eikonal model, and study its efficiency for both nuclear- and Coulomb-dominated
breakup reactions. Methods: We compare the energy and parallel-momentum cross sections obtained
with the dynamical eikonal approximation, the usual eikonal approximation, the CCE and the S-DEA.
Results: The S-DEA leads to precise energy distributions for both breakup reactions. The corresponding
parallel-momentum distributions obtained with the S-DEA are improved compared to the ones computed
with the eikonal model. It is more efficient for nuclear-dominated breakup than the CCE since it
reproduces better the shape and magnitude of the distribution. However, for the Coulomb breakup,
the distribution lacks asymmetry. Conclusions: The simplification of the DEA developed in this
work improves significantly the eikonal descriptions of breakup energy distribution for both
Coulomb- and nuclear-dominated reactions. The asymmetry of the parallel-momentum distribution
is enhanced for nuclear-dominated breakup. This study confirms that the asymmetry is due to dynamical
effects. A direct prospect of this work would be to extend this model to two-neutron halo-nucleus
projectiles.
