We develop a general framework to analyze the two important and much discussed questions concerning
(a) `orbital' and `spin' angular momentum carried by light and (b) the paraxial approximation of
the free Maxwell system both in the classical as well as quantum domains. After formulating the classical
free Maxwell system in the transverse gauge in terms of complex analytical signals we derive expressions
for the constants of motion associated with its Poincar\'{e} symmetry. In particular, we show that
the constant of motion corresponding to the total angular momentum ${\bf J}$ naturally splits into
an `orbital' part ${\bf L}$ and a `spin' part ${\bf S}$ each of which is a constant of motion in its own
right. We then proceed to discuss quantization of the free Maxwell system and construct the operators
generating the Poincar\'{e} group in the quantum context and analyze their algebraic properties
and find that while the quantum counterparts $\hat{{\bf L}}$ and $\hat{{\bf S}}$ of ${\bf L}$ and
${\bf S}$ go over into bona fide observables, they fail to satisfy the angular momentum algebra precluding
the possibility of their interpretation as `orbital' and `spin' operators at the classical level.
On the other hand $\hat{{\bf J}}=\hat{{\bf L}}+ \hat{{\bf S}}$ does satisfy the angular momentum
algebra and together with $\hat{{\bf S}}$ generates the group $E(3)$. We then present an analysis
of single photon states, paraxial quantization both in the scalar as well as vector cases, single
photon states in the paraxial regime. All along a close connection is maintained with the Hilbert
space $\mathcal{M}$ that arises in the classical context thereby providing a bridge between classical
and quantum descriptions of radiation fields.
