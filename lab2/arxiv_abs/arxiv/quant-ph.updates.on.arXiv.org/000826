Shannon quantum information entropies $S_{\rho,\gamma}$, Fisher informations $I_{\rho,\gamma}$,
Onicescu energies $O_{\rho,\gamma}$ and complexities $e^SO$ are calculated both in position
(subscript $\rho$) and momentum ($\gamma$) spaces for azimuthally symmetric 2D nanoring that
is placed into combination of transverse uniform magnetic field $\bf B$ and Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
flux $\phi_{AB}$ and whose potential profile is modeled by superposition of quadratic and inverse
quadratic dependencies on radius $r$. Increasing intensity $B$ flattens momentum waveforms $\Phi_{nm}({\bf
k})$ and in the limit of infinitely large fields they turn to zero, what means that the position wave
functions $\Psi_{nm}({\bf r})$, which are their Fourier counterparts, tend in this limit to the
$\delta$-functions. Position (momentum) Shannon entropy depends on the field $B$ as a negative
(positive) logarithm of $\omega_{eff}\equiv\left(\omega_0^2+\omega_c^2/4\right)^{1/2}$,
where $\omega_0$ determines the quadratic steepness of the confining potential and $\omega_c$
is a cyclotron frequency. This makes the sum ${S_\rho}_{nm}+{S_\gamma}_{nm}$ a field-independent
quantity that increases with the principal $n$ and azimuthal $m$ quantum numbers and does satisfy
entropic uncertainty relation. Position Fisher information does not depend on $m$, linearly increases
with $n$ and varies as $\omega_{eff}$ whereas its $n$ and $m$ dependent Onicescu counterpart ${O_\rho}_{nm}$
changes as $\omega_{eff}^{-1}$. The products ${I_\rho}_{nm}{I_\gamma}_{nm}$ and ${O_\rho}_{nm}{O_\gamma}_{nm}$
are $B$-independent quantities. A dependence of the measures on the ring geometry is discussed.
It is argued that a variation of the position Shannon entropy or Onicescu energy with the AB field
uniquely determines an associated persistent current as a function of $\phi_{AB}$ at $B=0$. An
inverse statement is correct too.
