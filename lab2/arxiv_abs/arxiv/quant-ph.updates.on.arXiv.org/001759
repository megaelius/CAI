Determinism is related to other fundamental concepts such as causality, prediction, and even notions
such as law, will, and intelligence. Concept of determinism has had many transformations throughout
the history of physics, and it has been so influential in this field. However, with the growth of quantum
physics, determinism became a scientific "dilemma" and has created many challenges in various
contemporary sciences. Most of modern physicists chose elimination of determinism. The basic
question is: Is determinism completely removable? To answer this question, this paper is to investigate
this concept analytically. At first we consider different aspects of the terminology and definition
of determinism. Particularly, we pay attention to different kinds of determinism including global/local
domain, complete/incomplete form, and the main factor in the formation of events. It is discussed
that although determinism took a complete and universal form in classical physics, because of some
philosophical ideas, determinism changed into a different concept, even as a problem and an undesirable
element, in the standard (Copenhagen interpretation of) quantum mechanics. It is explained that
determinism is a complex concept with a number of aspects and characteristics. Prediction, the
world accessibility, and connection between the past and the future are the characteristics of
the concept of determinism which cannot be set aside from the science. The final result is that, without
any pre-assumption or alternative interpretation as what is done in already known realistic and
deterministic theories as Bohmian quantum mechanics and/or many worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics, determinism cannot be completely denied in the standard (Copenhagen interpretation
of) quantum mechanics.
