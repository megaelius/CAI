Conditional quantum optical processes enable a wide range of technologies from generation of highly
non-classical states to implementation of quantum logic operations. The process fidelity that
can be achieved in a realistic implementation depends on a number of system parameters. Here we experimentally
examine Fock-state filtration, a canonical example of a broad class of conditional quantum operations
acting on a single optical field mode. This operation is based upon interference of the mode to be
manipulated with an auxiliary single-photon state at a beam splitter, resulting in the entanglement
of the two output modes. A conditional projective measurement onto a single photon at one output
mode heralds the success of the process. This operation, which implements a measurement-induced
nonlinearity, is capable of suppressing particular photon-number probability amplitudes of
an arbitrary quantum state. We employ coherent-state process tomography to determine the precise
operation realized in our experiment. To identify the key sources of experimental imperfection,
we develop a model of the process and identify three main contributions that significantly hamper
its efficacy. The reconstructed tensor is compared with a model of the process taking into account
sources of experimental imperfection with fidelity better than 0.95. This enables us to identify
three key challenges to overcome in realizing a filter with high fidelity - namely the single-photon
nature of the auxiliary state, high-mode overlap, and the need for number resolving detection when
heralding. The results show that the filter does indeed exhibit a nonlinear response as a function
of input photon number and preserves the phase relation between Fock layers of the output state,
providing promise for future applications.
