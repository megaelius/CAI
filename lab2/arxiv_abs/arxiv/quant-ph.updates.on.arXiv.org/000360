We present a strong connection between quantum information and the theory of quantum permutation
groups. Specifically we note that the projective permutation matrices corresponding to perfect
quantum strategies for the graph isomorphism game are the same notion as the magic unitaries that
are used to define the quantum automorphism group of a graph. This connection links quantum groups
to the more concrete notion of nonlocal games and physically observable quantum behaviours. In
this work, we exploit this by using ideas and results from quantum information in order to prove new
results about quantum automorphism groups of graphs, and about quantum permutation groups more
generally. In particular, we show that asymptotically almost surely all graphs have trivial quantum
automorphism group. Furthermore, we use examples of quantum isomorphic graphs from previous work
to construct an infinite family of graphs which are quantum vertex transitive but fail to be vertex
transitive, answering a question from the quantum permutation group literature. Our main tool
for proving these results is the introduction of orbits and orbitals (orbits on ordered pairs) of
quantum permutation groups. We show that the orbitals of a quantum permutation group form a coherent
configuration/algebra, a notion from the field of algebraic graph theory. We then prove that the
elements of this quantum orbital algebra are exactly the matrices that commute with the magic unitary
defining the quantum group. We furthermore show that quantum isomorphic graphs admit an isomorphism
of their quantum orbital algebras which maps the adjacency matrix of one graph to that of the other.
We hope that this work will encourage new collaborations among the communities of quantum information,
quantum groups, and algebraic graph theory.
