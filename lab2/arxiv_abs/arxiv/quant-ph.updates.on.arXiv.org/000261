With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and quantum supremacy,
machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising "killer" applications. Despite significant
effort, there has been a disconnect between most quantum machine learning proposals, the needs
of ML practitioners, and the capabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum
enhancement in the near future. In this contribution to the focus collection on "What would you do
with 1000 qubits?", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced
with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers
are still struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised or semisupervised learning, instead
of the popular and much more tractable ML techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets
with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable.
We focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key challenges we foresee
for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine
(QAHM); an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-resolution datasets on continuous
variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches
do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable
for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative
model. Although we illustrate this concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could
benefit as well from this hybrid quantum-classical framework.
