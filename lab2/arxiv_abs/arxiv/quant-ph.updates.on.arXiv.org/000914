The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling
implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics,
which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential
to significantly expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is
Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying
a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to
allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the
Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of
unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian
for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially
more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad
array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing
on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was
possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems
with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints
whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental
exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization,
exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator
Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide
brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.
