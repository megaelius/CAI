Superconducting cavities with high quality factors play an essential role in circuit quantum electrodynamics
and quantum computing. In measurements of the the intrinsic loss rates of high frequency modes,
it can be challenging to design an appropriate coupling to the measurement circuit in such a way that
the resulting signal is sufficiently strong but also that this coupling does not lead to unwanted
loading circuit, obscuring the intrinsic internal loss rates. Here, we propose and demonstrate
a spectroscopic probe of high-Q resonators based on the phenomena of electromagnetically-induced
transparency (EIT) between the resonator and qubit in the weak dispersive coupling regime. Applying
a sideband drive signal to the qubit, we observe an interference dip originated from EIT in the qubit
spectroscopy, originating from the quantum interference between the qubit probe signal and sideband
transition. From the width and the depth of the dip, we are able to extract the single photon linewidth
of the cavity from an analytical model. Working in a previously unexplored regime in which the qubit
has a larger linewidth than the cavity reduces the technical challenge of making a high-coherence
qubit and is advantageous for remaining in the weakly-invasive limit of coupling to the cavity.
Furthermore, the sideband and the dispersive coupling between the cavity and the qubit can be tuned
in situ controlling the strength of the sideband drive power and qubit-resonator dispersive coupling,
and the system can therefore be tuned to provide weakly invasive and efficient measurement of the
resonator without $a~priori$ knowledge of its internal loss rate.
