The use of special quantum states in boson interferometry to achieve sensitivities below the limits
established by classically-behaving coherent states has enjoyed immense success since its inception.
Squeezed states, number states and cat states have been implemented on various platforms and have
demonstrated improved measurement precision over coherent-state-based interferometers. Another
state is an equal superposition of two eigenstates with maximally different energies; this state
ideally reaches the full interferometric sensitivity allowed by quantum mechanics. We extend
a technique to create number states up to n = 100 and to generate superpositions of a harmonic oscillator
ground state and a number state of the form $1/\sqrt{2}(|0\rangle+|n\rangle)$ up to n = 18 in the
motion of a single trapped ion. While experimental imperfections prevent us from reaching the ideal
Heisenberg limit, we observe enhanced sensitivity to changes in the oscillator frequency that
initially increases linearly with n, with maximal value at n = 12 where we observe 2.1(1) times higher
sensitivity compared to an ideal measurement on a coherent state with the same average occupation
number. The quantum advantage from using number-state superpositions can be leveraged towards
precision measurements on any harmonic oscillator system; here it enables us to track the average
fractional frequency of oscillation of a single trapped ion to approximately $2.6 \times 10^{-6}$
in 5 s. Such measurements should enable improved characterization of imperfections and noise on
trapping potentials, which can lead to motional decoherence, an important source of error in quantum
information processing with trapped ions.
