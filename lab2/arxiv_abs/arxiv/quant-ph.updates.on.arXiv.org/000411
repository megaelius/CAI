It was recently found that it is theoretically possible for there to exist quantum processes in which
the order of the operations performed by separate parties cannot be ascribed a definite causal order.
Some of these processes have been claimed to have a physical realization in standard quantum mechanics
via coherent control of the times of the operations. A prominent example is the quantum SWITCH, which
was recently demonstrated experimentally. However, up until now, there has been no rigorous justification
for the interpretation of such an experiment as a genuine realization of a process with indefinite
causal order as opposed to a simulation of such a process. Where exactly are the local operations
of the parties in such an experiment? On what spaces do they act given that their times are indefinite?
Can we probe them directly rather than assume what they ought to be based on heuristic considerations?
How can we reconcile the claim that these operations really take place, each once as required, with
the fact that the structure of the presumed process implies that they cannot be part of any acyclic
circuit? Here, I offer a precise answer to these questions: the input and output systems of the operations
in such a process are generally nontrivial subsystems of Hilbert spaces that are tensor products
of Hilbert spaces associated with different times---a fact that is directly experimentally verifiable.
With respect to these time-delocalized subsystems, the structure of the process is that of a circuit
with a cycle, which cannot be reduced to a probabilistic mixture of acyclic circuits. I further show
that all bipartite processes that admit a certain type of isometric extension have a physical realization
on such time-delocalized subsystems. These results unveil a novel structure within quantum mechanics,
which may have important implications for physics and information processing.
