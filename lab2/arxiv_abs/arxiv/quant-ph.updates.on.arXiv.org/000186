In this paper we investigate the scalar Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in two of its forms, i.e., its electric
form and its gravitational form. The standard form of the electric AB effect involves having particles
(such as electrons) move in regions with zero electric field but different electric potentials.
When a particle is recombined with itself, it will have a different phase, which can show up as a change
in the way the single particle interferes with itself when it is recombined with itself. In the case
where one has quasi-static fields and potentials, the particle will invariably encounter fringing
fields, which makes the theoretical and experimental status of the electric AB effect much less
clear than that of the magnetic (or vector) AB effect. Here we propose using time varying fields outside
of a spherical shell, and potentials inside a spherical shell to experimentally test the scalar
AB effect. In our proposal a quantum system will always be in a field-free region but subjected to
a non-zero time-varying potentials. Furthermore, our system will not be spatially split and brought
back together as in the magnetic AB experiment. Therefore there is no spatial interference and hence
no shift in a spatial interference pattern to observe. Rather, there arises purely temporal interference
phenomena. As in the magnetic AB experiments, these effects are non-classical. We present two versions
of this idea: (i) a Josephson temporal interferometry experiment inside a superconducting spherical
shell with a time-varying surface charge; (ii) a two-level atom experiment in which the atomic spectrum
acquires FM sidebands when it is placed inside a spherical shell whose exterior mass is sinusoidally
varying with time. The former leads to a time-varying internal magnetic field, and the latter leads
to a time-varying gravitational redshift.
