A general challenge in various quantum experiments and applications is to develop suitable sources
for coherent particles. In particular, recent progress in microscopy, interferometry, metrology,
decoherence measurements and chip based applications rely on intensive, tunable, coherent sources
for free low energy electron matter waves. In most cases, the electrons get field emitted from a metal
nanotip where its radius and geometry towards a counter electrode determines the field distribution
and the emission voltage. A higher emission is often connected to faster electrons with smaller
de Broglie wavelengths, requiring larger pattern magnification after matter wave diffraction
or interferometry. This can be prevented with a well-known setup consisting of two counter electrodes
that allow independent setting of the beam intensity and velocity. However, it needs to be tested
if the coherent properties of such a source are preserved after the acceleration and deceleration
of the electrons. Here, we study the coherence of the beam in a biprism interferometer with a single
atom tip electron field emitter if the particle velocity and wavelength varies after emission.
With a Wien filter measurement and a contrast correlation analysis we demonstrate that the intensity
of the source at a certain particle wavelength can be enhanced up to a factor of 33 without changing
the transverse and longitudinal coherence of the electron beam. In addition, the energy width of
the single atom tip emitter was measured to be 377 meV, corresponding to a longitudinal coherence
length of 82 nm. The design has potential applications in interferometry, microscopy and sensor
technology
