Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying
different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource
theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection,
and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs revolutionize
the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems like entanglement, elevating them
from just being interesting from a fundamental point of view to being useful in performing practical
tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two
groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying
the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions
on physical systems, and that consists of all the physical processes allowed by the resource theory
and which acts invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing
tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how
one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different
QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear
quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have
great similarity on a deeper structural level. In this article we review the general framework of
a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource
measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied
QRTs in the literature.
