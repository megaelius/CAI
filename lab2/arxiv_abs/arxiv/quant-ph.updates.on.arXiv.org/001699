By means of the discrete truncated Wigner approximation we study dynamical phase transitions arising
in the steady state of transverse-field Ising models after a quantum quench. Starting from a fully
polarized ferromagnetic initial condition these transitions separate a phase with nonvanishing
magnetization along the ordering direction from a symmetric phase upon increasing the transverse
field. We consider two paradigmatic cases, a one-dimensional long-range model with power-law
interactions $\propto 1/r^{\alpha}$ decaying algebraically as a function of distance $r$ and
a two-dimensional system with short-range nearest-neighbour interactions. In the former case
we identify dynamical phase transitions for $\alpha \lesssim 2$ and we extract the critical exponents
from a data collapse of the steady state magnetization for up to 1200 lattice sites. We find identical
exponents for $\alpha \lesssim 0.5$, suggesting that the dynamical transitions in this regime
fall into the same universality class as the nonergodic mean-field limit. The two-dimensional
Ising model is believed to be thermalizing, which we also confirm using exact diagonalization for
small system sizes. Thus, the dynamical transition is expected to correspond to the thermal phase
transition, which is consistent with our data upon comparing to equilibrium quantum Monte-Carlo
simulations. We further test the accuracy of the discrete truncated Wigner approximation by comparing
against numerically exact methods such as exact diagonalization, tensor network as well as artificial
neural network states and we find good quantitative agreement on the accessible time scales. Finally,
our work provides an additional contribution to the understanding of the range and the limitations
of qualitative and quantitative applicability of the discrete truncated Wigner approximation.
