In recent communications (Khrennikov 2019a, 2019b, 2019c), A. Khrennikov argued for "eliminating
the issue of quantum nonlocality" from the analysis of quantum entanglement and quantum phenomena
in general. He proposed to differentiate quantum and classical phenomena and entanglement not
by their respective nonlocality and locality, as is common, but by the discreteness of quantum phenomena
vs. the continuity of classical phenomena, supplemented by Bohr's complementarity in the case
of quantum phenomena. As I argue here, however, the question may not be that of "eliminating the issue
of quantum nonlocality" but instead of illuminating this issue, a task that can, I also argue, be
pursued by relating quantum nonlocality to other key features of quantum phenomena. I suggest that
the following features of quantum phenomena and quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical
phenomena and classical physics--(1) the irreducible role of measuring instruments in defining
quantum phenomena; (2) discreteness; (3) complementarity; (4) entanglement; (5) quantum nonlocality;
and (6) the irreducibly probabilistic nature of quantum predictions--are all interconnected
in defining quantum phenomena and distinguishing them from classical ones, so that it is difficult
to give an unconditional priority to any one of them. To argue this case, I consider quantum phenomena
and quantum mechanics from a nonrealistic or, in terms adopted here, "reality-without-realism"
(RWR) perspective. This perspective extends Bohr's interpretation, grounded in his analysis
of the irreducible tole of measuring instruments in the constitution of quantum phenomena, with
quantum measurement itself defined by the entanglements between the quantum object under investigation
and the instrument used.
