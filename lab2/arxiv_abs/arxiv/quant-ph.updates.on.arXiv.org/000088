We construct relativistic-invariant spinning-particle Lagrangian without auxiliary variables.
Spin is considered as a composed quantity constructed on the base of non-Grassmann vector-like
variable. The variational problem guarantees both fixed value of spin and Frenkel condition on
spin-tensor. Taking into account the Frenkel condition, we obtain, inevitably, relativistic
corrections to the algebra of position variables: their classical brackets became noncommutative,
with the "parameter of non-commutativity" proportional to the spin-tensor. This leads to a number
of interesting consequences in quantum theory. We construct the relativistic quantum mechanics
in canonical formalism (in physical-time parametrization) and in covariant formalism (in arbitrary
parametrization). We show how state-vectors and operators of covariant formulation can be used
to compute mean values of physical operators of position and spin. This proves relativistic covariance
of canonical formalism. Various candidates for position and spin operators of an electron acquire
clear meaning and interpretation in the Lagrangian model of Frenkel electron. We also establish
the relation between Frenkel electron and positive-energy sector of Dirac equation, this allowed
us to turn to the long-standing problem on spin and position operators of Dirac theory. Contrary
to widely assumed opinion, our results argue in favor of Pryce's (d)-type operators. This implies
that effects of non-commutativity could be presented at the Compton wave length, in contrast to
conventional expectations at the Planck length. At last, we present the manifestly covariant form
of spin and position operators of Dirac equation.
