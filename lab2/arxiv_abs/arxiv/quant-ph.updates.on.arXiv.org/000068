A general problem of quantum field theories is the fact that the free vacuum and the vacuum for an interacting
theory belong to different, non-equivalent representations of the canonical (anti-)commutation
relations. In the external field problem of QED, we encounter this problem in the form that the Dirac
time evolution for an external field with non-vanishing magnetic components will not satisfy the
Shale-Stinespring condition, known to be necessary and sufficient for the existence of an implementation
on the fermionic Fock space. Therefore, a second quantization of the time evolution in the usual
way is impossible. In this thesis, we present several rigorous approaches to QED with time-dependent,
external fields and analyze in what sense a time evolution can exist in the second quantized theory.
We study different constructions of the fermionic Fock space and prove their equivalence. We study
and compare the results of Deckert et. al. (2010), where the time evolution is realized as unitary
transformations between time-varying Fock spaces, with those of Langmann and Mickelsson (1996),
who construct a "renormalization" for the time evolution and present a method to fix the phase of
the second quantized scattering operator by parallel transport in a principle fibre bundle over
the restricted, general linear group acting on the fermionic Fock space. We provide rigorous proof
for the fact that the second quantization by parallel transport preserves causality. These findings
seem to refute claims made in Scharf (1995) that the phase of the second quantized S-matrix is essentially
determined by the requirement of causality. We propose a simple solution to the problem of gauge
anomalies in the procedure of Langmann and Mickelsson, showing that the second quantization of
the scattering operator can be made gauge-invariant by using a suitable class of renormalizations.
