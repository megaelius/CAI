We study macroscopic realism through the Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGI) in two interacting qubit
system. The two qubits are coupled either with two Bosonic (thermal and photonic) baths or Fermionic
(electronic) baths. We study both how the equilibrium and nonequilibrium environments influence
the LGI. One way to characterize the nonequilibrium condition is by the different temperatures
(for the Bosonic baths) or the different chemical potentials (for the Fermionic baths). We also
study the heat or particle current and the entropy production rate generated by the nonequilibrium
environments. Analytical forms of the LGI and the maximal values of LGI based on the quantum master
equation beyond secular approximation are derived. The LGI function and its maximal value have
separated contributions, the part describing the coherent evolution and the part describing the
coupling between the system and environments. The environment coupling part can be from equilibrium
environment or nonequilibrium environment. The nonequilibrium dynamics is quantified by the
Bloch-Redfield equation which is beyond Lindblad form. We found that the nonequilibriumness quantified
by the temperature difference or chemical potential difference can lead to the LGI violation or
the increase of the maximal value of LGI, restoring the quantum nature from certain equilibrium
cases where LGI is preserved which gives rise to classical realism. The corresponding nonequilibrium
thermodynamic cost is quantified by the nonzero entropy production rate. The LGI violation enhancement
increases with the increase of the entropy production rate under certain nonequilibrium conditions.
Our finding of nonequilibrium promoted LGI violation suggests a new strategy for the design of quantum
information processing and quantum computational devices to maintain the quantum nature and quantum
correlations for long.
