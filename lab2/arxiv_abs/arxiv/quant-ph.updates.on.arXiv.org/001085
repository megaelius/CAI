Simulating quantum many-body systems on a classical computer generally requires a computational
cost that grows exponential with the number of particles. This computational complexity has been
the main obstacle to understanding various fundamental emergent phenomena in condensed matters
such as high-Tc superconductivity and the fractional quantum-Hall effect. The difficulty arises
because even the simplest models that are proposed to capture those phenomena cannot be simulated
on a classical computer. Recognizing this problem in 1981, Richard Feynman envisioned a quantum
simulator, an entirely new type of machine that exploits quantum superposition and operates by
individually manipulating its constituting quantum particles and their interactions. Recent
advances in various experimental platforms from cold atoms in optical lattices, trapped ions,
to solid-state systems have brought the idea of Feynman to the realm of reality. Among those, interacting
photons in superconducting circuits has been one of the promising platforms thanks to their local
controllability and long coherence times. Early theoretical proposals have shown possibilities
to realize quantum many-body phenomena of light using coupled cavity arrays such as Mott to superfluid
transitions and fractional quantum Hall states. Start-of-the-art experiments include realization
of interacting chiral edge states and stroboscopic signatures of localization of interacting
photons in a three-site and a nine-site superconducting circuit, respectively. Interacting photons
also serve as a natural platform to simulate driven-dissipative quantum many-body phenomena.
A 72-site superconducting circuit has also recently been fabricated to study a dissipative phase
transition of light.
