With the current interest in building quantum computers, there is a strong need for accurate and
efficient characterization of the noise in quantum gate implementations. A key measure of the performance
of a quantum gate is the minimum gate fidelity, i.e., the fidelity of the gate, minimized over all
input states. Conventionally, the minimum fidelity is estimated by first accurately reconstructing
the full gate process matrix using the experimental procedure of quantum process tomography (QPT).
Then, a numerical minimization is carried out to find the minimum fidelity. QPT is, however, well
known to be costly, and it might appear that we can do better, if the goal is only to estimate one single
number. In this work, we propose a hybrid numerical-experimental scheme that employs a numerical
gradient-free minimization (GFM) and an experimental target-fidelity estimation procedure
to directly estimate the minimum fidelity without reconstructing the process matrix. We compare
this to an alternative scheme, referred to as QPT fidelity estimation, that does use QPT, but directly
employs the minimum gate fidelity as the termination criterion. Both approaches can thus be considered
as direct estimation schemes. General theoretical bounds suggest a significant resource savings
for the GFM scheme over QPT fidelity estimation; numerical simulations for specific classes of
noise, however, show that both schemes have similar performance, reminding us of the need for caution
when using general bounds for specific examples. The GFM scheme, however, presents potential for
future improvements in resource cost, with the development of even more efficient GFM algorithms.
