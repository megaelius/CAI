Characterising quantum processes is a key task in and constitutes a challenge for the development
of quantum technologies, especially at the noisy intermediate scale of today's devices. One method
for characterising processes is randomised benchmarking, which is robust against state preparation
and measurement (SPAM) errors, and can be used to benchmark Clifford gates. A complementing approach
asks for full tomographic knowledge. Compressed sensing techniques achieve full tomography of
quantum channels essentially at optimal resource efficiency. So far, guarantees for compressed
sensing protocols rely on unstructured random measurements and can not be applied to the data acquired
from randomised benchmarking experiments. It has been an open question whether or not the favourable
features of both worlds can be combined. In this work, we give a positive answer to this question.
For the important case of characterising multi-qubit unitary gates, we provide a rigorously guaranteed
and practical reconstruction method that works with an essentially optimal number of average gate
fidelities measured respect to random Clifford unitaries. Moreover, for general unital quantum
channels we provide an explicit expansion into a unitary 2-design, allowing for a practical and
guaranteed reconstruction also in that case. As a side result, we obtain a new statistical interpretation
of the unitarity -- a figure of merit that characterises the coherence of a process. In our proofs
we exploit recent representation theoretic insights on the Clifford group, develop a version of
Collins' calculus with Weingarten functions for integration over the Clifford group, and combine
this with proof techniques from compressed sensing.
