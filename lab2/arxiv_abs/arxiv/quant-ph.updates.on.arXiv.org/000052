In quantum mechanics an incoming particle wave packet with sufficient energy will undergo both
transmission and reflection when encountering a barrier of lower energy, but in classical mechanics
there is no reflection, only transmission. In this paper we seek to explain the disappearance of
quantum-mechanical reflection in the quasi-classical limit, using standard methods of decoherence
through environmental interaction. We consider two models. In the first, the incoming particle
is classicalized by coupling it to an environment described by a standard Lindblad master equation
diagonalizing in position. We find, however, that suppression of reflection is achieved only for
environmental interaction so strong that large fluctuations in momentum are generated which blurs
the distinction between incoming and reflected wave packets. This negative conclusion also holds
for a complex potential which has similar implications for attempts to understand the suppression
of the Zeno effect using the same mechanism (discussed in more detail in another paper). A different
Lindblad master diagonalizing in momentum is shown to be successful in suppressing reflection
without large fluctuations but such a master equation is unphysical. We consider a second model
in which the barrier is modelled quantum-mechanically by a massive target particle coupled to an
environment to maintain it in a quasi-classical state. This avoids the fluctuations problem since
the incoming particle is not coupled to the environment directly. We find that reflection is significantly
suppressed as long as the decoherence timescale of the target particle is much smaller than certain
characteristic scattering timescales of the incoming particle, or equivalently, as long as the
velocity fluctuations in the target are larger than the velocity of the incoming particle.
