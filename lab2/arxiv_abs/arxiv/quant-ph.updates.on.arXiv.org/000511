Cheeger inequalities bound the spectral gap $\gamma$ of a space by isoperimetric properties of
that space and vice versa. In this paper, I derive Cheeger-type inequalities for nonpositive matrices
(aka stoquastic Hamiltonians), real matrices, and Hermitian matrices. For matrices written $H
= L+W$, where $L$ is either a combinatorial or normalized graph Laplacian, each bound holds independently
of any information about $W$ other than its class and the weighted Cheeger constant induced by its
ground-state. I show that independently of $\lVert W \rVert$: (1) when $W$ is diagonal and $L$ has
maximum degree $d_{\max}$, $2h \geq \gamma \geq \sqrt{h^2 + d_{\max}^2}-d_\max$; (2) when $W$
is real, we can route negative weighted edges along positive weighted edges such that the Cheeger
constant of the resulting graph obeys an inequality similar to that above; and (3) when $W$ is Hermitian,
the weighted Cheeger constant obeys $2h \geq \gamma$. The weighted Cheeger constant reduces bounds
on $\gamma$ to information contained in the underlying graph and the Hamiltonian's ground-state.
If efficiently computable, the constant opens up a very clear path towards adaptive quantum adiabatic
algorithms, those that adjust the adiabatic path based on spectral structure. I sketch a bashful
adiabatic algorithm that aborts the adiabatic process early, uses the resulting state to approximate
the weighted Cheeger constant, and restarts the process using the updated information. Should
this approach work, it would provide more rigorous foundations for adiabatic quantum computing
without a priori knowledge of the spectral gap.
