Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized biomedical science by providing non-invasive,
three-dimensional biological imaging. However, spatial resolution in conventional MRI systems
is limited to tens of microns, which is insufficient for imaging on molecular and atomic scales.
Here we demonstrate an MRI technique that provides sub-nanometer spatial resolution in three dimensions,
with single electron-spin sensitivity. Our imaging method works under ambient conditions and
can measure ubiquitous 'dark' spins, which constitute nearly all spin targets of interest and cannot
otherwise be individually detected. In this technique, the magnetic quantum-projection noise
of dark spins is measured using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer located near the surface
of a diamond chip. The spatial distribution of spins surrounding the NV magnetometer is imaged with
a scanning magnetic-field gradient. To evaluate the performance of the NV-MRI technique, we image
the three-dimensional landscape of dark electronic spins at and just below the diamond surface
and achieve an unprecedented combination of resolution (0.8 nm laterally and 1.5 nm vertically)
and single-spin sensitivity. Our measurements uncover previously unidentified electronic spins
on the diamond surface, which can potentially be used as resources for improved magnetic imaging
of samples proximal to the NV-diamond sensor. This three-dimensional NV-MRI technique is immediately
applicable to diverse systems including imaging spin chains, readout of individual spin-based
quantum bits, and determining the precise location of spin labels in biological systems.
