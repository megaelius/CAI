Geometrical phases acquired in cyclic quantum evolutions can be utilized as natural resources
for construct- ing robust logic gates for quantum information processing, which was originally
proposed through adiabatic changes of the driving Hamiltonian. Practically, much efforts have
been made to shorten the construction times of geometrical gates, known as non-adiabatic holonomic
quantum computation (NHQC). However, previous NHQC gates require the driving Hamiltonian to satisfy
a set of rather restrictive conditions, reducing the robust- ness of the resulting geometric gates
against control errors. Here we show that non-adiabatic geometric gates can be constructed in an
alternative way where the driving Hamiltonian can exhibit a high degree of flexibility for retaining
the robustness of the geometric phases. Consequently, this approach makes it possible to incorporate
most of the existing optimal control methods, such as dynamical decoupling, composite pulses,
and shortcut to adiabaticity, into the construction of geometrical gates, to further address different
types of errors. Furthermore, this extensible approach of geometric quantum computation can be
applied to various physical platform such as superconducting qubits and nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers. Specifically, we performed numerical simulation to show how the noise robustness in the
recent experimental implementations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 140503 (2017)] and [Nat. Photonics
11, 309 (2017)] of NHQC with NV centers can be significantly improved by our optimized NHQC approach.
These results cover a large class of new techniques combing the noise robustness of both geometric
phase and optimal control theory.
