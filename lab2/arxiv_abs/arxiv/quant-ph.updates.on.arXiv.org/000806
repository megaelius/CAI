The tremendous development of cloud computing and network technology makes it possible for multiple
people with limited resources to complete a large-scale computing with the help of cloud servers.
In order to protect the privacy of clients, secure multiparty computation plays an important role
in the process of computing. Recently, Clementi et al[\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.07,1.00}{Phys.
Rev. A {\bf 96}, 062317(2017)}] proposed a secure multiparty computation protocol using quantum
resources. In their protocol, utilizing only linear classical computing and limited manipulation
of quantum information, a method of computing $n-variable$ symmetric Boolean function $f(x_1,
x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ with degree 2 is proposed, and all clients can jointly compute $f(x_1, x_2, \cdots,
x_n)$ without revealing their private inputs with the help of a sever. They proposed an open problem:
are there more simple nonlinear functions like the one presented by them that can be used as subroutines
for larger computation protocols? We will give the answer to this question in this paper. Inspired
by Clementi et al's work, we continue to explore the quantum realization of Boolean functions. First,
we demonstrate a way to compute a class of $n-variable$ symmetric Boolean function $f_n^k$ by using
single-particle quantum state $|0\rangle$ and single-particle unitary operations $U_k$. Second,
we show that each $n-variable$ symmetric Boolean function can be represented by the linear combination
of $f_n^k(k=0,1,\cdots,n)$ and each function $f_n^k(2\leq k\leq n)$ can be used to perform secure
multiparty computation. Third, we propose an universal quantum implementation method for arbitrary
$n-variable$ symmetric Boolean function $f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$. Finally, we demonstrate
our secure multiparty computation protocol on IBM quantum cloud platform.
