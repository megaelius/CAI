In a view of recent proposals for the realization of anisotropic light-matter interaction in such
platforms as (i) non-stationary or inductively and capacitively coupled superconducting qubits,
(ii) atoms in crossed fields and (iii) semiconductor heterostructures with spin-orbital interaction,
the concept of generalized Dicke model has attracted great interest. Here we analyze the realistic
situation for this model when both the temperatures and numbers of two-level systems are finite.
The superradiant quantum phase transition, controlled by the unequal coupling strengths of rotating
wave and counter-rotating wave terms, becomes a fluctuational crossover in this case. We present
a rigorous study of the critical behavior near the superradiant phase transition using an equilibrium
path integral technique and Majorana representation of spin operators. Reducing the effective
theory to a non-Goldstone functional for superradiant order parameter, we integrate out thermal
fluctuations of its phase and arrive at a non-trivial dissipative action. We find a hierarchy of
interaction constants and temperature scales which characterize the system into the critical
region. The results include different universal behaviors of single-mode photon fluctuations,
a crossover from non-squeezed to squeezed phases, and a smooth transition between the regimes of
Dicke model (with discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry) and that of (anti-) and Tavis-Cummings $U(1)$
models. Remarkably, that critical scaling of the photon number remains invariant for all these
regimes, but fluctuational behavior and squeezing parameters are different. We also discuss a
minimal temperature of this approach and its relation to Bethe ansatz solution for integrable $U(1)$
limits.
