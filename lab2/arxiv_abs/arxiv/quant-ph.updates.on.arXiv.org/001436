Dynamics of open quantum systems depends on different types of initial correlations. On the one
hand, when system and environment are both inherently multipartite, initial correlations between
the parties of the composite environment make the dynamical map non-local, despite of local nature
of the interaction between each party of the system and the environment. On the other hand, initial
correlations between the open system and its environment prevents one from defining a completely
positive dynamical map. Recently, dephasing dynamics of photons has been used in both of these frameworks
- theoretically and experimentally - to demonstrate some fundamental and applicable aspects of
open system dynamics and memory effects. However, the earlier studies in this context are often
based solely on the concept of decoherence functions. Therefore, we still lack explicit master
equation descriptions for dynamics induced by correlated composite initial environmental states.
Also, a detailed understanding how initial system-environment correlations influence qubit
dynamics in the photonic context is missing. In this paper, we derive generic master equations for
the reduced dephasing dynamics of the two-photon polarization state when the bipartite environmental
frequency degrees of freedom are initially correlated. We thereby show the explicit dependence
of the operator form and the decay rates of the master equation on the initial frequency correlations
and the influence of various types of frequency distributions. Furthermore, we use recently developed
bath positive decomposition method to treat initially correlated polarization-frequency state
of a photon, and demonstrate how this allows new insight and detailed information on how the contributions
of different origin influence the photonic dephasing.
