The common wisdom in the field of quantum information theory is that when a system is initially correlated
with its environment, the map describing its evolution may fail to be completely positive. If true,
this would have practical and foundational significance. We here demonstrate, however, that the
common wisdom is mistaken. We trace the error to the standard argument for how the evolution map ought
to be defined. We show that it sometimes fails to define a linear map or any map at all and that these
pathologies persist even in completely classical examples. Drawing inspiration from the framework
of classical causal models, we argue that the correct definition of the evolution map is obtained
by considering a counterfactual scenario wherein the system is reprepared independently of any
systems in its causal past while the rest of the circuit remains the same, yielding a map that is always
completely positive. In a post-mortem on the standard argument, we highlight two distinct mistakes
that retrospectively become evident (in its application to completely classical examples): (i)
the types of constraints to which it appealed are constraints on what one can infer about the final
state of a system based on its initial state, where such inferences are based not just on the cause-effect
relation between them-which defines the correct evolution map-but also on the common cause of the
two; (ii) in a (retrospectively unnecessary) attempt to introduce variability in the input state,
it inadvertently introduced variability in the inference map itself, then tried to fit the input-output
pairs associated to these different maps with a single map.
