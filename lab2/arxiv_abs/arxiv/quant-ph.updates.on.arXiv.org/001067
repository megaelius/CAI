In this work we derive novel ultrafast shortcuts for adiabatic rapid passage for a qubit where the
only control variable is the longitudinal $z$-field, while the transverse $x$-field remains constant.
This restrictive framework is pertinent to some important tasks in quantum computing, for example
the design of a high fidelity controlled-phase gate can be mapped to the adiabatic quantum control
of such a qubit. We study this problem in the adiabatic reference frame and with appropriately rescaled
time, using as control input the derivative of the total field polar angle (with respect to rescaled
time). We first show that a constant pulse can achieve perfect adiabatic rapid passage at only specific
times, corresponding to resonant shortcuts to adiabaticity. We next show that, by using "on-off-on-...-on-off-on"
pulse-sequences with appropriate characteristics (amplitude, timing, and number of pulses),
a perfect fidelity can be obtained for every duration larger than the limit $\pi/\Omega$, where
$\Omega$ is the constant transverse $x$-field. We provide equations from which these characteristics
can be calculated. The proposed methodology for generalized resonant shortcuts exploits the advantages
of composite pulses in the rescaled time, while the corresponding control $z$-field varies continuously
and monotonically in the original time. Of course, as the total duration approaches the lower limit,
the changes in the control signal become more abrupt. These results are not restricted only to quantum
information processing applications, but is also expected to impact other areas, where adiabatic
rapid passage is used.
