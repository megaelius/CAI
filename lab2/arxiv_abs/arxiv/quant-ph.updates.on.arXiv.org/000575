Quantum simulation presents itself as one of the biggest advantages of developing quantum computers.
Simulating a quantum system classically is almost impossible beyond a certain system size whereas
a controllable quantum system inherently has the resources and computing space to simulate another
system. Analog quantum simulation is one of the ways of quantum simulation through which a known
system mimics an unknown system. A key aspect of this is the ability to generate the target Hamiltonian
using control operations which is referred to as Hamiltonian engineering. One way of doing this
is to apply pulse sequences over a length of time such that the average Hamiltonian over this period
is the desired one. In this thesis, we discuss the method of filtered Hamiltonian engineering which
works in a similar fashion. Using this technique, we create a star topology from a general network
of spins. Quantum communication between two parties is an important task for its applications in
information theory as well as for its use in a quantum computer. A typical solution to this is using
teleportation through the means of shared entangled qubits. Teleportation is not ideal for short-range
communication such as between two units in a quantum computer. It has been shown that information
can be transported from one node of a quantum spin network to another by natural evolution of the system
over time. Such networks are better suited for solid-state based computing architectures as well
as for short-range communication. The Hamiltonian that permits such transport however places
stringent requirements on the parameters of the network. While individual control of spins cannot
be avoided in most cases, excess control can introduce noise. In this thesis, we work on a few models
of spin networks that permit information transport with minimal requirements on the parameters
of the network.
