For a discrimination problem $\Phi_\eta$ consisting of $N$ linearly independent pure quantum
states $\Phi=\{|\phi_i\rangle\}$ and the corresponding occurrence probabilities $\eta=\{\eta_i\}$
we associate, up to a permutation over the probabilities $\{\eta_i\}$, a unique pair of density
matrices $\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}}$ defined on the $N$-dimensional
Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_N$. The first one, $\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}$, provides a representation
of a generic full-rank density matrix in terms of the parameters of the discrimination problem,
i.e. the mutual overlaps $\gamma_{ij}=\langle{\phi_i}|{\phi_j}\rangle$ and the occurrence
probabilities $\{\eta_i\}$. The second one on the other hand is defined as a diagonal density matrix
$\boldsymbol{\eta_p}$ with the diagonal entries given by the probabilities $\{\eta_i\}$ with
the ordering induced by the permutation $p$ of the probabilities. When the set $\Phi$ can be discriminated
unambiguously with probability one then $\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}}$.
On the other hand if the set lacks its independency and cannot be discriminated anymore the distinguishability
of the pair, measured by the fidelity $F(\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}, \boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}})$,
becomes minimum. This enables one to associate to each discrimination problem $\Phi_{\eta}$ a
unique distinguishability problem between two states $\boldsymbol{\rho_{_{T}}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta_{{p}}}$,
and define the maximum fidelity between them (maximum over all permutations of the probabilities
$\{\eta_i\}$) as the extent to which the set is discriminable. Calculating this quantity does not
require any optimization and we study its behaviour with some examples.
