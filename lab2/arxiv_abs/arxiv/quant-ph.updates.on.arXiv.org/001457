Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding inherent
quantum-mechanical properties that serve as resources in quantum information processing, but
resources motivated by physics may possess intractable mathematical structure to analyze, such
as non-uniqueness of maximally resourceful states, lack of convexity, and infinite dimension.
We investigate state conversion and resource measures in general QRTs under minimal assumptions
to figure out universal properties of physically motivated quantum resources that may have such
intractable mathematical structure. In the general setting, we prove the existence of maximally
resourceful states in one-shot state conversion. Also analyzing asymptotic state conversion,
we discover catalytic replication of quantum resources, where a resource state is infinitely replicable
by free operations. In QRTs without assuming uniqueness of maximally resourceful states, we formulate
the tasks of distillation and formation of quantum resources, and introduce distillable resource
and resource cost based on the distillation and the formation, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce
consistent resource measures that quantify the amount of quantum resources without contradicting
the rate of state conversion even in QRTs with non-unique maximally resourceful states. Progressing
beyond the previous work showing a uniqueness theorem for additive resource measures, we prove
the corresponding uniqueness inequality for the consistent resource measures; that is, consistent
resource measures of a quantum state take values between the distillable resource and the resource
cost of the state. These formulations and results establish a foundation of QRTs applicable to mathematically
intractable but physically motivated quantum resources in a unified way.
