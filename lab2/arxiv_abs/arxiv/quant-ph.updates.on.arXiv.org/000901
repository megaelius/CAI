Entanglement assistance is known to reduce the quantum communication complexity of evaluating
functions with distributed inputs. But does the type of entanglement matter, or are EPR pairs always
sufficient? This is a natural question because in several other settings maximally entangled states
are known to be less useful as a resource than some partially entangled state. These include non-local
games, tasks with quantum communication between players and referee, and simulating bipartite
unitaries or communication channels. By contrast, we prove that the bounded-error entanglement-assisted
quantum communication complexity of a function cannot be improved by more than a constant factor
by replacing maximally entangled states with arbitrary entangled states. In particular, we show
that every quantum communication protocol using $Q$ qubits of communication and arbitrary shared
entanglement can be $\epsilon$-approximated by a protocol using $O(Q/\epsilon+\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)$
qubits of communication and only EPR pairs as shared entanglement. Our second result concerns an
old question in quantum information theory: How much quantum communication is required to approximately
convert one pure bipartite entangled state into another? We show that the communication cost of
converting between two bipartite quantum states is upper bounded, up to a constant multiplicative
factor, by a natural and efficiently computable quantity which we call the $\ell_{\infty}$-Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) between those two states. Furthermore, we prove a complementary lower bound
on the cost of state conversion by the $\epsilon$-smoothed $\ell_{\infty}$-EMD, which is a natural
smoothing of the $\ell_{\infty}$-EMD that we will define via a connection with optimal transport
theory.
