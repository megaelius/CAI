Even the most sophisticated artificial neural networks are built by aggregating substantially
identical units called neurons. A neuron receives multiple signals, internally combines them,
and applies a non-linear function to the resulting weighted sum. Several attempts to generalize
neurons to the quantum regime have been proposed, but all proposals collided with the difficulty
of implementing non-linear activation functions, which is essential for classical neurons, due
to the linear nature of quantum mechanics. Here we propose a solution to this roadblock in the form
of a small quantum circuit that naturally simulates neurons with threshold activation. Our quantum
circuit defines a building block, the "quantum neuron", that can reproduce a variety of classical
neural network constructions while maintaining the ability to process superpositions of inputs
and preserve quantum coherence and entanglement. In the construction of feedforward networks
of quantum neurons, we provide numerical evidence that the network not only can learn a function
when trained with superposition of inputs and the corresponding output, but that this training
suffices to learn the function on all individual inputs separately. When arranged to mimic Hopfield
networks, quantum neural networks exhibit properties of associative memory. Patterns are encoded
using the simple Hebbian rule for the weights and we demonstrate attractor dynamics from corrupted
inputs. Finally, the fact that our quantum model closely captures (traditional) neural network
dynamics implies that the vast body of literature and results on neural networks becomes directly
relevant in the context of quantum machine learning.
