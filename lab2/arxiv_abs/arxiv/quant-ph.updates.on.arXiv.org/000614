The modular (or entanglement) Hamiltonian correspondent to the half-space-bipartition of a quantum
state uniquely characterizes its entanglement properties. However, in the context of lattice
models, its explicit form is analytically known only for the Ising chain and certain free theories
in one-dimension. In this work, we provide a throughout investigation of entanglement Hamiltonians
in lattice models obtained via the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem, which provides an explicit functional
form for the entanglement Hamiltonian itself in quantum field theory. Our study encompasses a variety
of one- and two-dimensional models, supporting diverse quantum phases and critical points, and,
most importantly, scanning several universality classes, including Ising, Potts, and Luttinger
liquids. We carry out extensive numerical simulations based on the density-matrix-renormalization-group
method, exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo. In particular, we compare the exact entanglement
properties and correlation functions to those obtained applying the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem
on the lattice. We carry out this comparison on both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the entanglement
Hamiltonian, and expectation values of correlation functions and order parameters. Our results
evidence that, as long as the low-energy description of the lattice model is well-captured by a Lorentz-invariant
quantum field theory, the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem provides a qualitatively and quantitatively
accurate description of the lattice entanglement Hamiltonian. The resulting framework paves
the way to direct studies of entanglement properties utilizing well-established statistical
mechanics methods and experiments.
