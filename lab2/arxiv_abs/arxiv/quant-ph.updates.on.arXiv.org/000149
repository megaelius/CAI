The control of quantum system dynamics is generally performed by seeking a suitable applied field.
The physical objective as a functional of the field forms the quantum control landscape, whose topology,
under certain conditions, has been shown to contain no critical point suboptimal traps, thereby
enabling effective searches for fields that give the global maximum of the objective. This paper
addresses the structure of the landscape as a complement to topological critical point features.
Recent work showed that landscape structure is highly favorable for optimization of state-to-state
transition probabilities, in that gradient-based control trajectories to the global maximum
value are nearly straight paths. The landscape structure is codified in the metric $R\geq 1.0$,
defined as the ratio of the length of the control trajectory to the Euclidean distance between the
initial and optimal controls. A value of $R=1$ would indicate an exactly straight trajectory to
the optimal observable value. This paper extends the state-to-state transition probability results
to the quantum ensemble and unitary transformation control landscapes. Again, nearly straight
trajectories predominate, and we demonstrate that $R$ can take values approaching 1.0 with high
precision. However, the interplay of optimization trajectories with critical saddle submanifolds
is found to influence landscape structure. A fundamental relationship necessary for perfectly
straight gradient-based control trajectories is derived wherein the gradient on the quantum control
landscape must be an eigenfunction of the Hessian. This relation is an indicator of landscape structure
and may provide a means to identify physical conditions when control trajectories can achieve perfect
linearity. The collective favorable landscape topology and structure provide a foundation to
understand why optimal quantum control can be readily achieved.
