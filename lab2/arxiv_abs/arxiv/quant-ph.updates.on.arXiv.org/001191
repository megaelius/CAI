We outline the Minimalistic Measurement Scheme (MMS) compatible with regular unitary evolution
of a closed quantum system. Within this approach, a part of the system becomes informationally isolated
(restricted) which leads to a natural emergence of the classical domain. This measurement scenario
is a simpler alternative to environment-induced decoherence. In its basic version, MMS involves
two ancilla qubits, $A$ and $X$, entangled with each other and with the System $S$. Informational
or thermodynamic cost of measurement is represented by $X$-qubit being isolated, i.e. becoming
unavailable for future interactions with the rest of the system. Conditional upon this isolation,
$A$-qubit, that plays the role of an Apparatus, becomes classical and records the outcome of the
measurement. The procedure may be used to perform von Neumann-style projective measurements or
generalized ones, that corresponds to Positive-Operator Value Measure (POVM). By repeating the
same generalized measurement multiple times with different $A$- and $X$-qubits, one asymptotically
approaches the wave function collapse in the basis determined by the premeasurement process. We
present a simple result for the total information extracted after $N$ such weak measurements. Building
upon MMS, we propose a construction that maps a history of a quantum system onto a set of $A$-qubits.
It resembles the Consistent History (CH) formulation of Quantum Mechanics (QM), but is distinct
from it, and is built entirely within the conventional QM. In particular, consistency postulate
of CH formalism is not automatically satisfied, but rather is an emerging property. Namely, each
measurement event corresponds to the branching of mutually exclusive classical realities whose
probabilities are additive. In a general case, however, the superposition between different histories
is determined by the history density matrix.
