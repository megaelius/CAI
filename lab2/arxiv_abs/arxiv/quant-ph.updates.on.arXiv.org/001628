This work addresses quantum adiabatic decoherence of many-body systems coupled to a boson field,
in the framework of the theory of open quantum systems. We focus on partitions of non-interacting
subsystems in order to highlight the collective correlation that appears exclusively due to the
coupling with a common environment. We restrict the analysis to "local" observables compatible
with the anisotropy of the system of interest, that is, to operators whose expectation values can
be put in terms of a density operator reduced both over the environment and also reduced to a single,
representative element of the partition. We derive an analytical expression for the time dependence
of the density matrix elements from first principles, without assuming coarse-graining. The proposal
generalizes the spin-boson model by introducing the many-body character within the system-environment
interaction Hamiltonian. The resulting decoherence function is a complex exponential whose exponent
has a real part that introduces a decay similar to that in the usual spin-boson model. On the contrary,
the imaginary part of the exponent accounts for the many-body character since it depends on the quantum
numbers and geometry of the whole partition. Motivated by the solid-state NMR problematic, we applied
the theoretical results to a partition of dipole-coupled spin pairs, in contact with a common phonon
bath. As a significant novelty, we find that the phase function of the decoherence function plays
the leading role, overshadowing the mechanism associated with the thermal state of the bath. The
final form of the decoherence rate has a direct dependence on the physical constants of the model.
Its value is remarkably similar to that measured in NMR time-reversal experiments, and its behaviour
also agrees with the experiment: it depends on the dipolar frequency and is entirely independent
of the sample temperature.
