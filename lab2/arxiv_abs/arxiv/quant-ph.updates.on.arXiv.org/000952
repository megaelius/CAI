Although the quantum state of a many-body system (e.g, a system consisting of several atoms) is described
in terms of its degrees of freedom, i.e., a large number of variables representing a point on the compact
space of quantum states, there is usually a small number of parameters that can be actually measured
experimentally. We show that the problem of deciding whether the underlying quantum state is entangled
is equivalent to the problem of deciding whether the set of measured parameters are the moments of
some measure defined over the compact space of states of the many-body system. By considering quantum
entanglement of n identical atoms we arrive at the truncated moment problem defined for symmetric
measures over a product of n copies of unit balls in R^d. We consider moments up to degree 2 since these
are most readily available experimentally. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for
belonging to the moment cone, which can be expressed via a linear matrix inequality (LMI) of size
at most 2d+2, which is independent of n. We can convert the LMIs into a set of explicit semialgebraic
inequalities giving necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the moment cone, and
show that the two conditions approach each other in the limit of large n. The inequalities are derived
via considering the dual cone of nonnegative polynomials, and its sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxation.
We show that the SOS relaxation of the dual cone is asymptotically exact, and using symmetry reduction
techniques (J. Pure Appl. Algebra 192, no. 1-3, 95, arXiv:1205.3102), it can be written as a small
linear matrix inequality of size at most 2d+2, which is independent of n. For the cone of nonnegative
polynomials we also prove an analogue of the half degree principle for globally nonnegative symmetric
polynomials (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 284, no. 1, 174, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 216, no. 4, 850).
