In this note, I analyse the code and the data generated by M. Fodje's (2013) simulation programs "epr-simple"
and "epr-clocked". They are written in Python were published on Github only, without any documentation
at all of how they worked. Inspection of the code showed that they make use of the detection loophole
and the coincidence loophole respectively. I evaluate them with appropriate modified Bell-CHSH
type inequalities: the Larsson detection-loophole adjusted CHSH, and the Larsson-Gill coincidence-loophole
adjusted CHSH. The experimental efficiencies turn out to be approximately eta = 81% (close to optimal)
and gamma = 55% (far from optimal). The observed values of CHSH are, as they must be, within the appropriate
adjusted bounds. Fodjes' detection-loophole model turns out to be very, very close to Pearle's
famous 1970 model, so the efficiency is very close to optimal. The model also has the same defect as
Pearle's: the joint detection rates exhibit signalling. The coincidence-loophole model is actually
an elegant modification of the detection-loophole model. Because of this, however, it cannot lead
to the optimal efficiency. Later versions of the programs included explanation of how they worked,
including formulas, though still no reference whatever to the literature on the two loopholes which
Fodje exploits. The documentation available now makes a lot of this paper superfluous. I plan to
rewrite it as a very, very short note. I will also use the few jewels in the work in a more ambitious paper,
still to be written, about the results of the bigger research project of which these experiments
were a small part.
