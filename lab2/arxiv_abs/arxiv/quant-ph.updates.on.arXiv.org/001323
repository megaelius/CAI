Usual Gaussian beams are particular scalar solutions to the paraxial Helmholtz equation, which
neglect the vector nature of light. In order to overcome this inconvenience, Simon et al. [J. Opt.
Soc. Am. A 3, 536 (1986)] found a paraxial solution to Maxwell's equation in vacuum, which includes
polarization in a natural way, though still preserving the spatial Gaussianity of the beams. In
this regard, it seems that these solutions, known as Gauss-Maxwell beams, are particularly appropriate
and a natural tool in optical problems dealing with Gaussian beams acted or manipulated by polarizers.
In this work, inspired in the Bohmian picture of quantum mechanics, a hydrodynamic-type extension
of such a formulation is provided and discussed, complementing the notion of electromagnetic field
with that of (electromagnetic) flow or streamline. In this regard, the method proposed has the advantage
that the rays obtained from it render a bona fide description of the spatial distribution of electromagnetic
energy, since they are in compliance with the local space changes undergone by the time-averaged
Poynting vector. This feature confers the approach a potential interest in the analysis and description
of single-photon experiments, because of the direct connection between these rays and the average
flow exhibited by swarms of identical photons (regardless of the particular motion, if any, that
these entities might have), at least in the case of Gaussian input beams. In order to illustrate the
approach, here it is applied to two common scenarios, namely the diffraction undergone by a single
Gauss-Maxwell beam and the interference produced by a coherent superposition of two of such beams.
