Error-detection and correction are necessary prerequisites for any scalable quantum computing
architecture. Given the inevitability of unwanted physical noise in quantum systems and the propensity
for errors to spread as computations proceed, computational outcomes can become substantially
corrupted. This observation applies regardless of the choice of physical implementation. In the
context of photonic quantum information processing, there has recently been much interest in passive
linear optics quantum computing, which includes boson-sampling, as this model eliminates the
highly-challenging requirements for feed-forward via fast, active control. That is, these systems
are passive by definition. In usual scenarios, error detection and correction techniques are inherently
active, making them incompatible with this model, arousing suspicion that physical error processes
may be an insurmountable obstacle. Here we explore a photonic error-detection technique, based
on W-state encoding of photonic qubits, which is entirely passive, based on post-selection, and
compatible with these near-term photonic architectures of interest. We show that this W-state
redundant encoding techniques enables the suppression of dephasing noise on photonic qubits via
simple fan-out style operations, implemented by optical Fourier transform networks, which can
be readily realised today. The protocol effectively maps dephasing noise into heralding failures,
with zero failure probability in the ideal no-noise limit. We present our scheme in the context of
a single photonic qubit passing through a noisy communication or quantum memory channel, which
has not been generalised to the more general context of full quantum computation.
