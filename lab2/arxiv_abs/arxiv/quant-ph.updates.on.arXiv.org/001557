Minor embedding heuristics have become an indispensable tool for compiling problems in quadratically
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) into the hardware graphs of quantum and CMOS annealing
processors. While recent embedding heuristics have been developed for annealers of moderate size
(about 2000 nodes) the size of the latest CMOS annealing processor (with 102,400 nodes) poses entirely
new demands on the embedding heuristic. This raises the question, if recent embedding heuristics
can maintain meaningful embedding performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. Here, we
develop an improved version of the probabilistic-swap-shift-annealing (PSSA) embedding heuristic
[which has recently been demonstrated to outperform the standard embedding heuristic by D-Wave
Systems (Cai et al., 2014)] and evaluate its embedding performance on hardware graphs of increasing
size. For random-cubic and Barabasi-Albert graphs we find the embedding performance of improved
PSSA to consistently exceed the threshold of the best known complete graph embedding by a factor
of 3.2 and 2.8, respectively, up to hardware graphs with 102,400 nodes. On the other hand, for random
graphs with constant edge density not even improved PSSA can overcome the deterministic threshold
guaranteed by the existence of the best known complete graph embedding. Finally, we prove a new upper
bound on the maximal embeddable size of complete graphs into hardware graphs of CMOS annealers and
show that the embedding performance of its currently best known complete graph embedding has optimal
order for hardware graphs with fixed coordination number.
