After a brief introduction to issues that plague the realization of a theory of quantum gravity,
I suggest that the main one concerns a quantization of the principle of relative simultaneity. This
leads me to a distinction between time and space, to a further degree than that present in the canonical
approach to general relativity. With this distinction, one can make sense of superpositions as
interference between alternative paths in the relational configuration space of the entire Universe.
But the full use of relationalism brings us to a timeless picture of Nature, as it does in the canonical
approach (which culminates in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation). After a discussion of Parmenides
and the Eleatics' rejection of time, I show that there is middle ground between their view of absolute
timelessness and a view of physics taking place in timeless configuration space. In this middle
ground, even though change does not fundamentally exist, the illusion of change can be recovered
in a way not permitted by Parmenides. It is recovered through a particular density distribution
over configuration space which gives rise to 'records'. Incidentally, this distribution seems
to have the potential to dissolve further aspects of the measurement problem that can still be argued
to haunt the application of decoherence to Many-Worlds quantum mechanics. I end with a discussion
indicating that the conflict between the conclusions of this paper and our view of the continuity
of the self may still intuitively bother us. Nonetheless, those conclusions should be no more challenging
to our intuition than Derek Parfit's thought experiments on the subject.
