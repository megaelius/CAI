One-dimensional PT-symmetric quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians having continuous spectra are
studied. The Hamiltonians considered have the form $H=p^2+V(x)$, where $V(x)$ is odd in $x$, pure
imaginary, and vanishes as $|x|\to\infty$. Five PT-symmetric potentials are studied: the Scarf-II
potential $V_1(x)=iA_1\,{\rm sech}(x)\tanh(x)$, which decays exponentially for large $|x|$;
the rational potentials $V_2(x)=iA_2\,x/(1+x^4)$ and $V_3(x)=iA_3\,x/(1+|x|^3)$, which decay
algebraically for large $|x|$; the step-function potential $V_4(x)=iA_4\,{\rm sgn}(x)\theta(2.5-|x|)$,
which has compact support; the regulated Coulomb potential $V_5(x)=iA_5\,x/(1+x^2)$, which
decays slowly as $|x|\to\infty$ and may be viewed as a long-range potential. The real parameters
$A_n$ measure the strengths of these potentials. Numerical techniques for solving the time-independent
Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problems associated with these potentials reveal that the spectra of
the corresponding Hamiltonians exhibit universal properties. In general, the eigenvalues are
partly real and partly complex. The real eigenvalues form the continuous part of the spectrum and
the complex eigenvalues form the discrete part of the spectrum. The real eigenvalues range continuously
in value from $0$ to $+\infty$. The complex eigenvalues occur in discrete complex-conjugate pairs
and for $V_n(x)$ ($1\leq n\leq4$) the number of these pairs is finite and increases as the value of
the strength parameter $A_n$ increases. However, for $V_5(x)$ there is an {\it infinite} sequence
of discrete eigenvalues with a limit point at the origin. This sequence is complex, but it is similar
to the Balmer series for the hydrogen atom because it has inverse-square convergence.
