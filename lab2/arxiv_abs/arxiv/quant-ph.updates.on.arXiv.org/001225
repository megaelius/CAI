A cat-state is formed as the steady-state solution for the signal mode of an ideal, degenerate parametric
oscillator, in the limit of negligible single-photon signal loss. In the presence of the signal
loss, this is no longer true over timescales much longer than the damping time. However, for sufficient
parametric nonlinearity, a cat-state can exist as a transient state. In this paper, we study the
dynamics of the creation and decoherence of cat-states in degenerate parametric oscillation,
both with and without the effect of a Kerr nonlinearity that applies to recent superconducting-circuit
experiments generating cat-states in microwave cavities. We determine the time of formation and
the lifetime of a cat-state in terms of three dimensionless parameters $\lambda$, $g$ and $\chi$.
These relate to the driving strength, the parametric nonlinearity, and the Kerr nonlinearity,
respectively. We find that the Kerr nonlinearity has little effect on the threshold parametric
nonlinearity ($g>1$) required for the formation of cat-states, and does not significantly alter
the decoherence time of the cat-state, but can reduce the time of formation. The quality of the cat-state
increases with the value $g$, and can also improved by the Kerr nonlinearity. To verify the existence
and quality of the cat-state, we consider several signatures, including interference fringes
and negativity, and show how they can be computed. We simulate a superconducting-circuit experiment
using published experimental parameters and found good agreement with experimental results,
indicating that a nonclassical cat-like state with a small Wigner negativity is generated in the
experiment. A stronger nonlinearity would lead to a cat-state with convincing cat-state signatures.
Finally, we explore the feasibility of creating large cat-states with a coherent amplitude of 20,
corresponding to 400 photons.
