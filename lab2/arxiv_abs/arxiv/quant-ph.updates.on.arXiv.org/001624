We study the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of a coupled two-qubit system, in which each qubit
is coupled with one individual environment. We study how the nonequilibrium environments (with
different temperatures or chemical potentials) influence the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality.
Dependent on the inter-qubit coupling strength (relatively weak or strong compared to local qubits'
frequencies) or the environmental nature (bosonic or fermionic), the two-qubit steady state can
have strong correlations and violate the Bell inequalities with two or three measurements per party.
Equilibrium environments compared to the nonequilibrium environments (with fixed mean temperatures
or chemical potentials) do not give the maximal entanglement or the maximal violation of Bell inequalities
if the two qubits are not identical, such as the two qubits having an energy detuning or coupling to
the environment with unbalanced weights. The nonequilibrium conditions (characterized by the
temperature differences) which give the maximal violation of Bell inequalities are different
from the nonequilibrium conditions which give the maximal entanglement. The entanglement and
the Bell nonlocality have different responses to the nonequilibrium environments. The spatial
asymmetric two-qubit system coupled with nonequilibrium bosonic environments shows the thermal
rectification effect, which can be witnessed by the Bell nonlocality. Our study demonstrates that
the nonequilibrium environments are both valuable for the entanglement and Bell nonlocality resources,
based on different optimal nonequilibrium conditions though.
