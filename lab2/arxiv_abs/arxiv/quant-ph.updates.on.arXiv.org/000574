The exceptional Lie group E8 plays a prominent role in both mathematics and theoretical physics.
It is the largest symmetry group associated with the most general possible normed division algebra,
namely, that of the non-associative real octonions, which --- thanks to their non-associativity
--- form the only possible closed set of spinors (or rotors) that can parallelize the 7-sphere. By
contrast, here we show how a similar 7-sphere also arises naturally from the algebraic interplay
of the graded Euclidean primitives, such as points, lines, planes, and volumes, which characterize
the three-dimensional conformal geometry of the ambient physical space, set within its eight-dimensional
Clifford-algebraic representation. Remarkably, the resulting algebra remains associative,
and allows us to understand the origins and strengths of all quantum correlations locally, in terms
of the geometry of the compactified physical space, namely, that of a quaternionic 3-sphere, S3,
with S7 being its algebraic representation space. Every quantum correlation can thus be understood
as a correlation among a set of points of this S7, computed using manifestly local spinors within
S3, thereby extending the stringent bounds of +/-2 set by Bell inequalities to the bounds of +/-2\/2
on the strengths of all possible strong correlations, in the same quantitatively precise manner
as that predicted within quantum mechanics. The resulting geometrical framework thus overcomes
Bell's theorem by producing a strictly deterministic and realistic framework that allows a locally
causal understanding of all quantum correlations, without requiring either remote contextuality
or backward causation.
