We define and study XOR games in the framework of general probabilistic theories, which encompasses
all physical models whose predictive power obeys minimal requirements. The bias of an XOR game under
local or global strategies is shown to be given by a certain injective or projective tensor norm,
respectively. The intrinsic (i.e. model-independent) advantage of global over local strategies
is thus connected to a universal function $r(n,m)$ called `projective-injective ratio'. This
is defined as the minimal constant $\rho$ such that $\|\cdot\|_{X\otimes_\pi Y}\leq\rho\,\|\cdot\|_{X\otimes_\varepsilon
Y}$ holds for all Banach spaces of dimensions $\dim X=n$ and $\dim Y=m$, where $X\otimes_\pi Y$ and
$X \otimes_\varepsilon Y$ are the projective and injective tensor products. By requiring that
$X=Y$, one obtains a symmetrised version of the above ratio, denoted by $r_s(n)$. We prove that $r(n,m)\geq
19/18$ for all $n,m\geq 2$, implying that injective and projective tensor products are never isometric.
We then study the asymptotic behaviour of $r(n,m)$ and $r_s(n)$, showing that, up to log factors:
$r_s(n)$ is of the order $\sqrt{n}$ (which is sharp); $r(n,n)$ is at least of the order $n^{1/6}$;
and $r(n,m)$ grows at least as $\min\{n,m\}^{1/8}$. These results constitute our main contribution
to the theory of tensor norms. In our proof, a crucial role is played by an `$\ell_1$/$\ell_2$/$\ell_{\infty}$
trichotomy theorem' based on ideas by Pisier, Rudelson, Szarek, and Tomczak-Jaegermann. The main
operational consequence we draw is that there is a universal gap between local and global strategies
in XOR games, and that this grows as a power of the minimal local dimension. In the quantum case, we
are able to narrow this gap up to universal constants. As a corollary, we obtain an improved bound
on the scaling of the maximal quantum data hiding efficiency against local measurements.
