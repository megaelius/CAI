Quantum materials that host a flat band, such as pseudospin-1 lattices and magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene, can exhibit drastically new physical phenomena including unconventional superconductivity,
orbital ferromagnetism, and Chern insulating behaviors. We report a surprising class of electronic
in-gap edge states in pseudospin-1 materials without the conventional need of band-inversion
topological phase transitions or introducing magnetism via an external magnetic type of interactions.
In particular, we find that, in two-dimensional gapped (insulating) Dirac systems of massive spin-1
quasiparticles, in-gap edge modes can emerge through only an {\em electrostatic potential} applied
to a finite domain. Associated with these unconventional edge modes are spontaneous formation
of pronounced domain-wall spin textures, which exhibit the feature of out-of-plane spin-angular
momentum locking on both sides of the domain boundary and are quite robust against boundary deformations
and impurities despite a lack of an explicit topological origin. The in-gap modes are formally three-component
evanescent wave solutions, akin to the Jackiw-Rebbi type of bound states. Such modes belong to a
distinct class due to the following physical reasons: three-component spinor wave function, unusual
boundary conditions, and a shifted flat band induced by the external scalar potential. Not only
is the finding of fundamental importance, but it also paves the way for generating highly controllable
in-gap edge states with emergent spin textures using the traditional semiconductor gate technology.
Results are validated using analytic calculations of a continuum Dirac-Weyl model and tight-binding
simulations of realistic materials through characterizations of local density of state spectra
and resonant tunneling conductance.
