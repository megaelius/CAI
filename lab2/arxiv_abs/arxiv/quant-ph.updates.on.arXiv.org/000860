In the framework of DFT, the lowest triplet excited state, T$_1$, can be evaluated using multiple
formulations, the most straightforward of which are UDFT and TDDFT. Assuming the exact XC functional
is applied, UDFT and TDDFT provide identical energies for T$_1$ ($E_{\rm T}$), which is also a constraint
that we require our XC functionals to obey. However, this condition is not satisfied by most of the
popular XC functionals, leading to inaccurate predictions of low-lying, spectroscopically and
photochemically important excited states, such as T$_1$ and S$_1$. Inspired by the optimal tuning
strategy for frontier orbital energies [Stein, Kronik, and Baer, {\it J. Am. Chem. Soc.} {\bf 2009},
131, 2818], we proposed a novel and non-empirical prescription of constructing an XC functional
in which the agreement between UDFT and TDDFT in $E_{\rm T}$ is strictly enforced. Referred to as
"triplet tuning", our procedure allows us to formulate the XC functional on a case-by-case basis
using the molecular structure as the exclusive input, without fitting to any experimental data.
The first triplet tuned XC functional, TT-$\omega$PBEh, is formulated as a long-range-corrected
hybrid of PBE and HF functionals [Rohrdanz, Martins, and Herbert, {\it J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 2009},
130, 054112] and tested on four sets of large organic molecules. Compared to existing functionals,
TT-$\omega$PBEh manages to provide more accurate predictions for key spectroscopic and photochemical
observables, including but not limited to $E_{\rm T}$, $E_{\rm S}$, $\Delta E_{\rm ST}$, and $I$,
as it adjusts the effective electron-hole interactions to arrive at the correct excitation energies.
This promising triplet tuning scheme can be applied to a broad range of systems that were notorious
in DFT for being extremely challenging.
