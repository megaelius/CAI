We show how to compute on all quantum states several measures that characterise asymptotic quantum
coherence manipulation under restricted classes of operations. We focus in particular on the distillable
coherence, i.e. the maximum rate of production of approximate pure bits of coherence starting from
independent copies of an input state $\rho$, and on the coherence cost, i.e. the minimum rate of consumption
of pure coherence bits that is needed in order to generate many copies of a target state $\rho$ with
vanishing error. We obtain the first closed-form expression for the distillable coherence under
strictly incoherent operations (SIO), showing that it is the same as that obtained by means of physically
incoherent operations (PIO). This remarkable fact shows that SIO and PIO are equally weak as far
as distillation is concerned, and sheds light on the recently discovered phenomenon of generic
bound coherence. At the same time, it provides us with an explicit optimal distillation protocol
that is amenable to practical implementations. On a different line, we also give a single-letter
formula for the coherence cost under PIO, showing that it is finite on a nontrivial set of states with
nonzero volume that we are able to characterise with precision. Since PIO can be realised in a laboratory
by appending incoherent ancillae, performing incoherent unitaries, and making incoherent measurements,
our result puts fundamental limitations on coherence manipulation in an experimentally relevant
setting. We uncover the phenomenon of abyssally bound coherence under PIO, that is, the existence
of states with vanishing PIO distillable coherence yet infinite PIO coherence cost. Our findings
complete the picture of asymptotic coherence manipulation under all the main classes of incoherent
operations.
