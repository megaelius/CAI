High efficiency postprocessing of continuous-variable quantum key distribution system has a
significant impact on the secret key rate and transmission distance of the system. Currently, the
postprocessing mainly contains four steps in the following order: sifting, parameter estimation,
information reconciliation, and privacy amplification. For a quantum channel with unknown prior
characteristics, part of the raw keys (typically half) have to be sacrificed to estimate the channel
parameters, which is used to assist in error correction (part of information reconciliation) and
estimate the secret key rate. This introduces a tradeoff between the secret key rate and the accuracy
of parameter estimation when considering the finite-size effect. In this paper, we propose a high
efficiency postprocessing method which uses all the raw keys for both parameter estimation and
key extraction. It is realized by exchanging the order of parameter estimation and information
reconciliation, while the other steps remain unchanged. After the sifting step, the extra data
(used for phase compensation and synchronization etc) can be used to roughly estimate the quantum
channel parameters, or using the estimated results of last block, thus the error correction can
be realized normally. After the success of error correction, the reconciler recovers the raw keys
of the other side by a reverse mapping function. Then she uses all the raw keys of both sides for parameter
estimation to estimate the quantum channel parameters and calculate the secret key rate of the system.
Finally, they perform the privacy amplification step to obtain the unconditional security keys.
We show that this method improves the accuracy of parameter estimation and the secret key rate of
continuous-variable quantum key distribution system.
