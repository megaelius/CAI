Since its inception Bohmian mechanics has been generally regarded as a hidden-variable theory
aimed at providing an objective description of quantum phenomena. To date, this rather narrow conception
of Bohm's proposal has caused it more rejection than acceptance. Now, after 65 years of Bohmian mechanics,
should still be such an interpretational aspect the prevailing appraisal? Why not favoring a more
pragmatic view, as a legitimate picture of quantum mechanics, on equal footing in all respects with
any other more conventional quantum picture? These questions are used here to introduce a discussion
on an alternative way to deal with Bohmian mechanics at present, enhancing its aspect as an efficient
and useful picture or formulation to tackle, explore, describe and explain quantum phenomena where
phase and correlation (entanglement) are key elements. This discussion is presented through two
complementary blocks. The first block is aimed at briefly revisiting the historical context that
gave rise to the appearance of Bohmian mechanics, and how this approach or analogous ones have been
used in different physical contexts. This discussion is used to emphasize a more pragmatic view
to the detriment of the more conventional hidden-variable (ontological) approach that has been
a leitmotif within the quantum foundations. The second block focuses on some particular formal
aspects of Bohmian mechanics supporting the view presented here, with special emphasis on the physical
meaning of the local phase field and the associated velocity field encoded within the wave function.
As an illustration, a simple model of Young's two-slit experiment is considered. The simplicity
of this model allows to understand in an easy manner how the information conveyed by the Bohmian formulation
relates to other more conventional concepts in quantum mechanics. This sort of pedagogical application
is also aimed at ...
