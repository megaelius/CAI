In this work we present a security analysis for quantum key distribution, establishing a rigorous
tradeoff between various protocol and security parameters for a class of entanglement-based and
prepare-and-measure protocols. The goal of this paper is twofold: 1) to review and clarify the state-of-the-art
security analysis based on entropic uncertainty relations, and 2) to provide an accessible resource
for researchers interested in a security analysis of quantum cryptographic protocols that takes
into account finite resource effects. For this purpose we collect and clarify several arguments
spread in the literature on the subject with the goal of making this treatment largely self-contained.
More precisely, we focus on a class of prepare-and-measure protocols based on the Bennett-Brassard
(BB84) protocol as well as a class of entanglement-based protocols similar to the Bennett-Brassard-Mermin
(BBM92) protocol. We carefully formalize the different steps in these protocols, including randomization,
measurement, parameter estimation, error correction and privacy amplification, allowing us
to be mathematically precise throughout the security analysis. We start from an operational definition
of what it means for a quantum key distribution protocol to be secure and derive simple conditions
that serve as sufficient condition for secrecy and correctness. We then derive and eventually discuss
tradeoff relations between the block length of the classical computation, the noise tolerance,
the secret key length and the security parameters for our protocols. Our results significantly
improve upon previously reported tradeoffs.
