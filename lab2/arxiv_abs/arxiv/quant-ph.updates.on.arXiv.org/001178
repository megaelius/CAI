Quantum entanglement is an integral part of quantum optics and has been exploited in areas such as
computation, cryptography and metrology. The entanglement between photons can be present in various
degrees of freedom (DOFs), and even the simplest bi-partite systems can occupy a large Hilbert space.
Therefore, it is desirable to exploit this multi-dimensional space for various quantum applications
by fully controlling the properties of the entangled photons in multiple DOFs. While current entangled-photon
sources are capable of generating entanglement in one or more DOFs, there is currently a lack of practical
techniques that can shape and control the entanglement properties in multiple DOFs. Here we show
that cascading two or more entangled-photon sources with tunable linear media in between allows
us to generate photon-pairs whose entanglement properties can be tailored and shaped in the frequency
and polarisation domains. We first develop a quantum mechanical model to study the quantum state
generated from the cascade structure with special considerations paid to the effects of pump temporal
coherence, linear dispersion, and in-structure polarisation transformation applied between
the entangled-photon sources. We then experimentally generate photon-pairs with tunable entanglement
properties by manipulating the dispersion and birefringence properties of the linear medium placed
in between two entangled-photon sources. This is done in an all-fibre, phase stable, and alignment-free
configuration. Our results show that the cascade structure offers a great deal of flexibility in
tuning the properties of entangled photons in multiple DOFs, opening up a new avenue in engineering
quantum light sources.
