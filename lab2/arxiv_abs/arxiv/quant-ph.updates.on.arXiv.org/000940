Laser-cooled atoms that are trapped and optically interfaced with light in nanophotonic waveguides
are a powerful platform for fundamental research in quantum optics as well as for applications in
quantum communication and quantum information processing. Ever since the first realization of
such a hybrid quantum nanophotonic, heating rates of the atomic motion observed in various experimental
settings have typically been exceeding those in comparable free-space optical microtraps by about
three orders of magnitude. This excessive heating is a roadblock for the implementation of certain
protocols and devices. Its origin has so far remained elusive and, at the typical atom-surface separations
of less than an optical wavelength encountered in nanophotonic traps, numerous effects may potentially
contribute to atom heating. Here, we theoretically describe the effect of mechanical vibrations
of waveguides on guided light fields and provide a general theory of particle-phonon interaction
in nanophotonic traps. We test our theory by applying it to the case of laser-cooled cesium atoms
in nanofiber-based two-color optical traps. We find excellent quantitative agreement between
the predicted heating rates and experimentally measured values. Our theory predicts that, in this
setting, the dominant heating process stems from the optomechanical coupling of the optically
trapped atoms to the continuum of thermally occupied flexural mechanical modes of the waveguide
structure. Beyond unraveling the long-standing riddle of excessive heating in nanofiber-based
atom traps, we also study the dependence of the heating rates on the relevant system parameters.
Our findings allow us to propose several strategies for minimizing the heating. Finally, our findings
are also highly relevant for optomechanics experiments with dielectric nanoparticles that are
optically trapped close to nanophotonic waveguides.
