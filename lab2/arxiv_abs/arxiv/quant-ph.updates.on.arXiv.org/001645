As the advances in quantum hardware bring us into the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era,
one possible task we can perform without quantum error correction using NISQ machines is the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE) due to its shallow depth. A specific problem that we can tackle is the strongly
interacting Fermi-Hubbard model, which is classically intractable and has practical implications
in areas like superconductivity. In this Article, we outline the details about the gate sequence,
the measurement scheme and the relevant error mitigation techniques for the implementation of
the Hubbard VQE on a NISQ platform. We perform resource estimation for both silicon spin qubits and
superconducting qubits for a 50-qubit simulation, which cannot be solved exactly via classical
means, and find similar results. The number of two-qubit gates required is on the order of 20000.
Hence, to suppress the circuit error rate to a level such that we can obtain meaningful results with
the aid of error mitigation, we need to achieve a two-qubit gate error rate of $\sim 10^{-4}$. When
searching for the ground state, we need a few days for one gradient-descent iteration, which is impractical.
This can be reduced to around 10 minutes if we distribute our task among hundreds of quantum processors.
Hence, implementing a 50-qubit Hubbard model VQE on a NISQ machine can be on the brink of being feasible
in near term, but further optimisation of our simulation scheme, improvements in the gate fidelity,
improvements in the optimisation scheme and advances in the error mitigation techniques are needed
to overcome the remaining obstacles. The scalability of the hardware platform is also essential
to overcome the runtime issue via parallelisation.
