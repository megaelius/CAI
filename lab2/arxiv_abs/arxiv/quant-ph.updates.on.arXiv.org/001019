A dynamical quantum phase transition can occur during time evolution of sudden quenched quantum
systems across a phase transition. It corresponds to the nonanalytic behavior at a critical time
of the rate function of the quantum state return amplitude, analogous to nonanalyticity of the free
energy density at the critical temperature in macroscopic systems. A variety of many-body systems
can be represented in momentum space as a spin-1/2 state evolving on the Bloch sphere, where each
momentum mode is decoupled and thus can be simulated independently by a single qubit. Here, we report
the observation of a dynamical quantum phase transition in a superconducting qubit simulation
of the quantum quench dynamics of many-body systems. We take the Ising model with a transverse field
as an example for demonstration. In our experiment, the spin state, which is initially polarized
longitudinally, evolves based on a Hamiltonian with adjustable parameters depending on the momentum
and strength of the transverse magnetic field. The time evolving quantum state is read out by state
tomography. Evidence of dynamical quantum phase transitions, such as paths of time evolution states
on the Bloch sphere, non-analytic behavior of the dynamical free energy and the emergence of Skyrmion
lattice in momentum-time space, is observed. The experimental data agrees well with theoretical
and numerical calculations. The experiment demonstrates for the first time explicitly the topological
invariant, both topologically trivial and non-trivial, for dynamical quantum phase transitions.
Our results show that the quantum phase transitions of this class of many-body systems can be simulated
successfully with a single qubit by varying certain control parameters over the corresponding
momentum range.
