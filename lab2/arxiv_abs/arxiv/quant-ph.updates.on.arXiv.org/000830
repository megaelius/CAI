The field of device-independent (DI) quantum information processing concerns itself with devising
and analysing protocols, such as quantum key distribution, without referring to the quality of
the physical devices utilised to execute the protocols. Instead, the analysis is based on the observed
correlations that arise during a repeated interaction with the devices and, in particular, their
ability to violate the so called Bell inequalities. Since the analysis of DI protocols holds irrespectively
of the underlying physical device, it implies that any device can be used to execute the protocols:
If the apparatus is of poor quality, the users of the protocol will detect it and abort; otherwise,
they will accomplish their goal. This strong statement comes at a price-- the analysis of DI protocols
is, a priori, extremely challenging. The thesis presents an approach that can be taken to simplify
the analysis of DI information processing protocols. The idea is the following: Instead of analysing
the most general device leading to the observed correlations, one should first analyse a significantly
simpler device that, in each interaction with the user, behaves in an identical way, independently
of all other interactions. We call such a device an independently and identically distributed (IID)
device. As the next step, special techniques are used to prove that, without loss of generality,
the analysis of the IID device implies similar results for the most general device. These are termed
reductions to IID. We present two mathematical techniques that can be used as reductions to IID in
the DI setting, each accompanied by a showcase-application that exemplifies the reduction's usage
and benefits. Performing the analysis via a reduction to IID leads to simpler proofs and significant
quantitive improvements, matching the tight results proven when analysing IID devices.
