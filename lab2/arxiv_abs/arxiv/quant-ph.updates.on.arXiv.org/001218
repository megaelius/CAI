We establish an operational characterization of general convex resource theories -- describing
the resource content of not only states, but also measurements and channels, both within quantum
mechanics and in general probabilistic theories (GPTs) -- in the context of state and channel discrimination.
We find that discrimination tasks provide a unified operational description for quantification
and manipulation of resources by showing that the family of robustness measures can be understood
as the maximum advantage provided by any physical resource in several different discrimination
tasks, as well as establishing that such discrimination problems can fully characterize the allowed
transformations within the given resource theory. Specifically, we introduce quantifiers of
resourcefulness of states, measurements, and channels in any GPT based on the generalized robustness,
and show that they exactly characterize the maximum advantage that a given resource provides over
all free states, measurements, or channels in a class of state or channel discrimination tasks.
In quantum mechanics, we show that the robustness of measurement can be alternatively understood
as the maximal increase in one-shot accessible information when compared to free measurements.
We furthermore endow the standard robustness of a state with an operational meaning as the quantifier
of the maximum advantage in binary channel discrimination tasks. Finally, we show that several
classes of channel and state discrimination tasks can form complete families of monotones fully
characterizing the transformations of states and measurements under any chosen class of free operations.
Our results establish a fundamental connection between operational tasks of discrimination and
core concepts of resource theories, valid for all physical theories with no additional assumptions
about the structure of the GPT required.
