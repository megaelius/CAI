One of the most accurate methods for solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation uses
a combination of the dynamic Fourier method with the split-operator algorithm on a tensor-product
grid. To reduce the number of required grid points, we let the grid move together with the wavepacket,
but find that the na\"ive algorithm based on an alternate evolution of the wavefunction and grid
destroys the time reversibility of the exact evolution. Yet, we show that the time reversibility
is recovered if the wavefunction and grid are evolved simultaneously during each kinetic or potential
step; this is achieved by using the Ehrenfest theorem together with the splitting method. The proposed
algorithm is conditionally stable, symmetric, time-reversible, and conserves the norm of the
wavefunction. The preservation of these geometric properties is shown analytically and demonstrated
numerically on a three-dimensional harmonic model and collinear model of He-H$_{2}$ scattering.
We also show that the proposed algorithm can be symmetrically composed to obtain time-reversible
integrators of an arbitrary even order. We observed $10000$-fold speedup by using the tenth- instead
of the second- order method to obtain a solution with a time discretization error below $10^{-9}$.
Moreover, using the adaptive grid instead of the fixed grid resulted in a 64-fold reduction in the
required number of grid points in the harmonic system and made it possible to simulate the He-H$_{2}$
scattering for six times longer, while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Applicability of the
algorithm to high-dimensional quantum dynamics is demonstrated using the strongly anharmonic
eight-dimensional H\'{e}non--Heiles model.
