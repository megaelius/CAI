Device-independent certifications employ Bell tests to guarantee the proper functioning of an
apparatus from the sole knowledge of observed measurement statistics, i.e. without assumptions
on the internal functioning of the devices. When these Bell tests are implemented with lossy devices,
one has to post-select the events that lead to successful detections and thus rely on a fair sampling
assumption. The question that we address in this paper is what remains of a device-independent certification
under fair sampling. We provide an intuitive description of post-selections in terms of filters
and define the fair sampling assumption as a property of these filters, equivalent to the definition
introduced in [Berry et. al., PRA 81(1), 012109 (2010)]. When this assumption is fulfilled, the
post-selected data is reproduced by an ideal experiment where lossless devices measure a filtered
state which can be obtained from the actual state via local probabilistic maps. Trusted conclusions
can thus be obtained on the quantum properties of this filtered state and the corresponding measurement
statistics can reliably be used, e.g., for randomness generation or quantum key distribution.
We also explore a stronger notion of fair sampling leading to the conclusion that the post-selected
data is a fair representation of the data that would be obtained with lossless detections. Furthermore,
we show that our conclusions hold in cases of small deviations from exact fair sampling. Finally,
we describe setups previously or potentially used in Bell-type experiments under fair sampling
and identify the underlying device-specific assumptions.
