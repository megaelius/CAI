The generation of certifiable randomness is the most fundamental information-theoretic task
that meaningfully separates quantum devices from their classical counterparts. We propose a protocol
for exponential certified randomness expansion using a single quantum device. The protocol calls
for the device to implement a simple quantum circuit of constant depth on a 2D lattice of qubits. The
output of the circuit can be verified classically in linear time, and is guaranteed to contain a polynomial
number of certified random bits assuming that the device used to generate the output operated using
a (classical or quantum) circuit of sub-logarithmic depth. This assumption contrasts with the
locality assumption used for randomness certification based on Bell inequality violation or computational
assumptions. To demonstrate randomness generation it is sufficient for a device to sample from
the ideal output distribution within constant statistical distance. Our procedure is inspired
by recent work of Bravyi et al. (Science 2018), who introduced a relational problem that can be solved
by a constant-depth quantum circuit, but provably cannot be solved by any classical circuit of sub-logarithmic
depth. We develop the discovery of Bravyi et al. into a framework for robust randomness expansion.
Our proposal does not rest on any complexity-theoretic conjectures, but relies on the physical
assumption that the adversarial device being tested implements a circuit of sub-logarithmic depth.
Success on our task can be easily verified in classical linear time. Finally, our task is more noise-tolerant
than most other existing proposals that can only tolerate multiplicative error, or require additional
conjectures from complexity theory; in contrast, we are able to allow a small constant additive
error in total variation distance between the sampled and ideal distributions.
