Universal quantum computation will require qubit technology based on a scalable platform, together
with quantum error correction protocols that place strict limits on the maximum infidelities for
one- and two-qubit gate operations. While a variety of qubit systems have shown high fidelities
at the one-qubit level, superconductor technologies have been the only solid-state qubits manufactured
via standard lithographic techniques which have demonstrated two-qubit fidelities near the fault-tolerant
threshold. Silicon-based quantum dot qubits are also amenable to large-scale manufacture and
can achieve high single-qubit gate fidelities (exceeding 99.9 %) using isotopically enriched
silicon. However, while two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in silicon, it has not yet been possible
to rigorously assess their fidelities using randomized benchmarking, since this requires sequences
of significant numbers of qubit operations ($\gtrsim 20$) to be completed with non-vanishing fidelity.
Here, for qubits encoded on the electron spin states of gate-defined quantum dots, we demonstrate
Bell state tomography with fidelities ranging from 85 % to 92 % and two-qubit randomized benchmarking
with an average Clifford gate fidelity of 77 % and average Controlled-ROT (CROT) fidelity of 91 %.
These fidelities are found to be limited by the relatively slow gate times employed here compared
with the decoherence times $T_2^*$ of the qubits. Silicon qubit designs employing fast gate operations
based on high Rabi frequencies, together with advanced pulsing techniques, should therefore enable
significantly higher fidelities in the near future.
