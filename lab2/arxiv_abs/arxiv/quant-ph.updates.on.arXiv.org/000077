The efficiency of the future devices for quantum information processing will be limited mostly
by the finite decoherence rates of the individual qubits and quantum gates. Recently, substantial
progress was achieved in enhancing the time within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent
dynamics. This progress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external decoherence
sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the material-inherent sources
of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases, quantum devices are affected by noise decreasing
with frequency, f, approximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due
to material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting with quantum variables
of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the environment that destroys the phase coherence
of the device can be thought of as a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops
between their states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad domain, the
resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large frequency range. In this paper we review
the current state of the theory of decoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. We discuss
basic mechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices and then review several models describing
the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices. The main focus of the review is to analyze
how the 1/f noise destroys their coherent operation. We start from individual qubits concentrating
mostly on the devices based on superconductor circuits, and then discuss some special issues related
to more complicated architectures. Finally, we consider several strategies for minimizing the
noise-induced decoherence.
