Recent realization of a kinetically-constrained chain of Rydberg atoms by Bernien et al. [Nature
551, 579 (2017)] resulted in the observation of unusual revivals in the many-body quantum dynamics.
In our previous work [arXiv:1711.03528] such dynamics was attributed to the existence of "quantum
scarred" eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized model. Here we present
a detailed study of the eigenstate properties of the same model. We find that the majority of the eigenstates
exhibit anomalous thermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs
ensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum, we identify non-ergodic eigenstates that
strongly violate the ETH, whose number grows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same
eigenstates were identified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to explain
the revivals observed in experiment. Here we find that these eigenstates, in addition to highly
atypical expectation values of local observables, also exhibit sub-thermal entanglement entropy
that scales logarithmically with the system size. Moreover, we identify an additional class of
quantum scarred eigenstates, and discuss their manifestations in the dynamics starting from initial
product states. We use forward scattering approximation to describe the structure and physical
properties of quantum-scarred eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the stability of quantum scars
to various perturbations. We observe that quantum scars remain robust when the introduced perturbation
is compatible with the forward scattering approximation. In contrast, the perturbations which
most efficiently destroy quantum scars also lead to the restoration of "canonical" thermalization.
