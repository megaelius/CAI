In two-party, two-input and two-output measurement scenario only relevant Bell's inequality
is the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) form. They also provide the necessary and sufficient
conditions for local realism. Any other form, such as, Clauser-Horne and Wigner forms reduce to
the CHSH one. Standard Leggett-Garg inequalities are often considered to be the temporal analog
of CHSH inequalities. But, they do not provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for macrorealism.
There is thus scope of formulating new macrorealist inequalities different and stronger than the
standard Leggett-Garg inequalities for testing compatibility between the macrorealism and quantum
theory. In this paper, we propose three different classes of macrorealistic inequalities in three-time
scenario; (i) The ones equivalent to standard Leggett-Garg inequalities in both macrorealist
model and in quantum theory. (ii) A class of inequalities which are equivalent to the standard ones
in macrorealist model but inequivalent and stronger in quantum theory (iii) Another class of inequalities
which are inquivalent to the all formulations of Leggett-Garg inequalities both in macrorealist
model and in quantum theory. This class of macrorealist inequalities reveals the incompatibility
between macrorealism and quantum theory for specific cases even when any other formulation of Leggett-Garg
inequalities fail to do so. We extend the formulations of the class (ii) inequalities to the four-time
and two-time measurement scenario. Further, we provide a brief discussion about the alternate
formulation of macrorealism which was derived based on the no-signaling in time conditions.
