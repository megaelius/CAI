Suppose that a polynomial-time mixed-state quantum circuit, described as a sequence of local unitary
interactions followed by a partial trace, generates a quantum state shared between two parties.
One might then wonder, does this quantum circuit produce a state that is separable or entangled?
Here, we give evidence that it is computationally hard to decide the answer to this question, even
if one has access to the power of quantum computation. We begin by exhibiting a two-message quantum
interactive proof system that can decide the answer to a promise version of the question. We then
prove that the promise problem is hard for the class of promise problems with "quantum statistical
zero knowledge" (QSZK) proof systems by demonstrating a polynomial-time Karp reduction from the
QSZK-complete promise problem "quantum state distinguishability" to our quantum separability
problem. By exploiting Knill's efficient encoding of a matrix description of a state into a description
of a circuit to generate the state, we can show that our promise problem is NP-hard with respect to
Cook reductions. Thus, the quantum separability problem (as phrased above) constitutes the first
nontrivial promise problem decidable by a two-message quantum interactive proof system while
being hard for both NP and QSZK. We also consider a variant of the problem, in which a given polynomial-time
mixed-state quantum circuit accepts a quantum state as input, and the question is to decide if there
is an input to this circuit which makes its output separable across some bipartite cut. We prove that
this problem is a complete promise problem for the class QIP of problems decidable by quantum interactive
proof systems. Finally, we show that a two-message quantum interactive proof system can also decide
a multipartite generalization of the quantum separability problem.
