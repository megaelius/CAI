Does "epistemic non-signalling" ensure the peaceful coexistence of special relativity and quantum
nonlocality? The possibility of an affirmative answer is of great importance to deterministic
approaches to quantum mechanics given recent developments towards generalizations of Bell's
theorem. By generalizations of Bell's theorem we here mean efforts that seek to demonstrate the
impossibility of any deterministic theories to obey the predictions of Bell's theorem, including
even nonlocal hidden-variables theories such as de Broglie-Bohm theory. The present work offers
arguments showing why such efforts towards generalization may fall short of their stated goal.
In particular, we reject the use of the non-signalling theorem as an argument against the logical
possibility of deterministic quantum theories. We proceed by presenting an entirely informal
treatment of key physical and metaphysical assumptions, and of their interrelationship, in attempts
seeking to generalize Bell's theorem on the basis of an ontic, foundational interpretation of the
non-signalling theorem. We here argue that the non-signalling theorem must instead be viewed as
an epistemic, phenomenological, or operational theorem i.e. one that refers exclusively to what
epistemic agents can, or rather cannot, do. That is, we emphasize that the non-signalling theorem
is a theorem about the operational inability of epistemic agents, e.g. human observers, to signal
information. A major reason in favor of our conclusion is that any definition of signalling or of
non-signalling invariably requires a reference to epistemic agents, and what these agents can
actually measure and report; otherwise, the non-signalling theorem would equal a general "no-influence"
theorem.
