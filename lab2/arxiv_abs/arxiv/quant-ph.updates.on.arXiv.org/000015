Quantum wires subject to the combined action of spin-orbit and Zeeman coupling in the presence of
\emph{s}-wave pairing potentials (superconducting proximity effect in semiconductors or superfluidity
in cold atoms) are one of the most promising systems for the developing of topological phases hosting
Majorana fermions. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry is essential for the appearance of unpaired
Majorana fermions. By implementing a \emph{time-dependent} spin rotation, we show that the standard
magnetostatic model maps into a \emph{non-magnetic} one where the breaking of time-reversal symmetry
is guaranteed by a periodical change of the spin-orbit coupling axis as a function of time. This suggests
the possibility of developing the topological superconducting state of matter driven by external
forces in the absence of magnetic fields and magnetic elements. From a practical viewpoint, the
scheme avoids the disadvantages of conjugating magnetism and superconductivity, even though
the need of a high-frequency driving of spin-orbit coupling may represent a technological challenge.
We describe the basic properties of this Floquet system by showing that finite samples host unpaired
Majorana fermions at their edges despite the fact that the bulk Floquet quasienergies are gapless
and that the Hamiltonian at each instant of time preserves time-reversal symmetry. Remarkably,
we identify the mean energy of the Floquet states as a topological indicator. We additionally show
that the localized Floquet Majorana fermions are robust under local perturbations. Our results
are supported by complementary numerical Floquet simulations.
