Driven-dissipative systems are expected to give rise to non-equilibrium phenomena that are absent
in their equilibrium counterparts. However, phase transitions in these systems generically exhibit
an effectively classical equilibrium behavior in spite of their non-equilibrium origin. In this
paper, we show that multicritical points in such systems lead to a rich and genuinely non-equilibrium
behavior. Specifically, we investigate a driven-dissipative model of interacting bosons that
possesses two distinct phase transitions: one from a high- to a low-density phase---reminiscent
of a liquid-gas transition---and another to an antiferromagnetic phase. Each phase transition
is described by the Ising universality class characterized by an (emergent or microscopic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry. They, however, coalesce at a multicritical point, giving rise to a non-equilibrium model
of coupled Ising-like order parameters described by a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.
Using a dynamical renormalization-group approach, we show that a pair of non-equilibrium fixed
points (NEFPs) emerge that govern the long-distance critical behavior of the system. We elucidate
various exotic features of these NEFPs. In particular, we show that a generic continuous scale invariance
at criticality is reduced to a discrete scale invariance. This further results in complex-valued
critical exponents and spiraling phase boundaries, and it is also accompanied by a complex Liouvillian
gap even close to the phase transition. As direct evidence of the non-equilibrium nature of the NEFPs,
we show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is violated at all scales, leading to an effective
temperature that becomes "hotter" and "hotter" at longer and longer wavelengths. Finally, we argue
that this non-equilibrium behavior can be observed in cavity arrays with cross-Kerr nonlinearities.
