Non-locality and steering are both non-classical phenomena witnessed in Nature as a result of quantum
entanglement. It is now well-established that one can study non-locality independently of the
formalism of quantum mechanics, in the so-called device-independent framework. With regards
to steering, although one cannot study it completely independently of the quantum formalism, "post-quantum
steering" has been described, that is steering which cannot be reproduced by measurements on entangled
states but do not lead to superluminal signalling. Furthermore, post-quantum steering was shown
to be independent of non-locality. In this work we present a framework based on the study of quantum
channels in which one can study steering (and non-locality) in quantum theory and beyond. In this
framework, we show that kinds of steering are directly related to particular families of quantum
channels that have been previously introduced by Beckman, Gottesman, Nielsen, and Preskill [Phys.
Rev. A 64, 052309 (2001)]. In particular, the most general kind of post-quantum steering (and non-signalling
correlations) can result from causal channels, and quantum steering (and quantum correlations)
can result from localizable channels. Inspired by this connection we introduce the set of almost
localizable channels, which give rise to the set of almost quantum correlations and assemblages.
Our approach allows us to easily recover, and generalise, the celebrated Gisin-Hughtston-Jozsa-Wootters
theorem, and initiate the study of post-quantum Buscemi non-locality and non-classical teleportation.
In this way, we see post-quantum non-locality and steering as just two aspects of a more general phenomenon.
