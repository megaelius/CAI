In this work we analyze the incidence of the plates' thickness on the Casimir force and radiative
heat transfer for a configuration of parallel plates in a non-equilibrium scenario, relating to
Lifshitz's and Landauer's formulas. From a first-principles canonical quantization scheme for
the study of the matter-field interaction, we give closed-form expressions for the non-equilibrium
Casimir force and the heat transfer between plates of thickness $d_{\rm L},d_{\rm R}$. We distinguish
three different contributions to the Casimir force and to the heat transfer in the general non-equilibrium
situation: two associated to each of the plates, and one to the initial state of the field. We analyze
the dependence of the Casimir force and heat transfer with the plate thickness (setting $d_{\rm
L}=d_{\rm R}\equiv d$), showing the scale at which each magnitude converges to the value of infinite
thickness ($d\rightarrow+\infty$) and how to correctly reproduce the non-equilibrium Lifshitz's
formula. For the heat transfer, we show that Landauer's formula does not apply to every case (where
the three contributions are present), but it is correct for some specific situations. We also analyze
the interplay of the different contributions for realistic experimental and nanotechnological
conditions, showing the impact of the thickness in the measurements. For small thickness (compared
to the separation distance), the plates act to decrease the background blackbody flux, while for
large thickness the heat is given by the baths' contribution only. The combination of these behaviors
allows for the possibility of having a tunable minimum in the heat transfer that is experimentally
attainable and observable for metals, and also of having vanishing heat flux in the gap when those
difference are of opposite signs (thermal shielding). These features turns out to be relevant for
nanotechnological applications.
