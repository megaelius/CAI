Recent experimental advances in controlling dissipation have brought about unprecedented flexibility
in engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in open classical and quantum systems. A particular
interest centers on the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems, which exhibit unique
phases with no Hermitian counterparts. However, no systematic understanding in analogy with the
periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors has been achieved. In this paper,
we develop a coherent framework of topological phases of non-Hermitian systems. After elucidating
the physical meaning and the mathematical definition of non-Hermitian topological phases, we
start with one-dimensional lattices, which exhibit topological phases with no Hermitian counterparts
and are found to be characterized by an integer topological winding number even with no symmetry
constraint, reminiscent of the quantum Hall insulator in Hermitian systems. A system with a nonzero
winding number, which is experimentally measurable from the wave-packet dynamics, is shown to
be robust against disorder, a phenomenon observed in the Hatano-Nelson model with asymmetric hopping
amplitudes. We also unveil a novel bulk-edge correspondence that features an infinite number of
(quasi-)edge modes. We then apply the K-theory to systematically classify all the non-Hermitian
topological phases in the Altland-Zirnbauer classes in all dimensions. The obtained periodic
table unifies time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, leading to highly nontrivial predictions
such as the absence of non-Hermitian topological phases in two dimensions. We provide concrete
examples for all the nontrivial non-Hermitian AZ classes in zero and one dimensions. In particular,
we identify a Z2 topological index for arbitrary quantum channels. Our work lays the cornerstone
for a unified understanding of the role of topology in non-Hermitian systems.
