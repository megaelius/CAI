We consider the natural extension of two-player nonlocal games to an arbitrary number of players.
An important question for such nonlocal games is their behavior under parallel repetition. For
two-player nonlocal games, it is known that both the classical and the non-signaling value of any
game converges to zero exponentially fast under parallel repetition, given that the game is non-trivial
to start with (i.e., has classical/non-signaling value <1). Very recent results show similar
behavior for the quantum value of a two-player game under parallel repetition. For nonlocal games
with three or more players, very little is known up to present on their behavior under parallel repetition;
this is true for the classical, the quantum and the non-signaling value. In this work, we show a parallel
repetition theorem for the non-signaling value of a large class of multi-player games, for an arbitrary
number of players. Our result applies to all multi-player games for which all possible combinations
of questions have positive probability; this class in particular includes all free games, in which
the questions to the players are chosen independently. Specifically, we prove that if the original
game has a non-signaling value smaller than 1, then the non-signaling value of the $n$-fold parallel
repetition is exponentially small in $n$. Our parallel repetition theorem for multi-player games
is weaker than the known parallel repetition results for two-player games in that the rate at which
the non-signaling value of the game decreases not only depends on the non-signaling value of the
original game (and the number of possible responses), but on the complete description of the game.
Nevertheless, we feel that our result is a first step towards a better understanding of the parallel
repetition of nonlocal games with more than two players.
