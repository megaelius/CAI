The SQCRAMscope is a recently realized Scanning Quantum CRyogenic Atom Microscope that utilizes
an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate to measure magnetic fields emanating from solid-state samples.
The quantum sensor does so with unprecedented DC sensitivity at micron resolution from room-to-cryogenic
temperatures. An additional advantage of the SQCRAMscope is the preservation of optical access
to the sample: Magnetometry imaging of, e.g., electron transport may be performed in concert with
other imaging techniques. This multimodal imaging capability can be brought to bear with great
effect in the study of nematicity in iron-pnictide high-temperature superconductors, where the
relationship between electronic and structural symmetry-breaking resulting in a nematic phase
is under debate. Here, we combine the SQCRAMscope with an in situ microscope that measures optical
birefringence near the surface. This enables simultaneous and spatially resolved detection of
both bulk and surface manifestations of nematicity via transport and structural deformation channels,
respectively. By performing the first local measurement of emergent resistivity anisotropy in
iron pnictides, we observe a spatially inhomogeneous increase in the temperature at which optical
birefringence appears near the surface over that at which anisotropic local transport appears
within the bulk. This is consistent with the existence of a higher-temperature so-called `extraordinary'
surface nematic transition, albeit one that emerges inhomogeneously. More broadly, these measurements
demonstrate the SQCRAMscope's ability to reveal important insights into the physics of complex
quantum materials.
