Since its inception, research of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) has extended our understanding
of light-matter interactions and our ability to utilize them. Thus far, all the work in this field
has been focused on light interacting with bound electron systems - such as atoms, molecules, quantum
dots, and quantum circuits. In contrast, markedly different physical phenomena are found in free-electron
systems, the energy distribution of which is continuous and not discrete, implying tunable transitions
and selection rules. In addition to their uses for electron microscopy, the interaction of free
electrons with light enables important phenomena such as Cherenkov radiation, Compton scattering,
and free-electron lasing. However, no experiment has shown the integration of free electrons into
the framework of CQED, because the fundamental electron-light interaction is limited in strength
and lifetime. This limit explains why many phenomena have remained out of reach for experiments
with free electrons. In this work, we developed the platform for studying CQED at the nanoscale with
free electrons and demonstrated it by observing their coherent interaction with cavity photons
for the first time. We also directly measure the cavity photon lifetime via a free electron probe
and show more than an order of magnitude enhancement in the electron-photon interaction strength.
These capabilities may open new paths toward using free electrons as carriers of quantum information,
even more so after strong coupling between free electrons and cavity photons will have been demonstrated.
Efficient electron-cavity photon coupling could also allow new nonlinear phenomena of cavity
opto-electro-mechanics and the ultrafast exploration of soft matter or other beam-sensitive
materials using low electron current and low laser exposure.
