Many promising approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation require repeated quantum nondemolition
(QND) readout of binary observables such as quantum bits (qubits). A commonly used figure of merit
for readout performance is the error rate for binary assignment in a single repetition. However,
it is known that this figure of merit is insufficient. Indeed, real-world readout outcomes are typically
analog instead of binary. Binary assignment therefore discards important information on the level
of confidence in the analog outcomes. Here, a generalized figure of merit that fully captures the
information contained in the analog readout outcomes is proposed. This figure of merit is the Chernoff
information associated with the statistics of the analog readout outcomes in one repetition. Unlike
the single-repetition error rate, the Chernoff information uniquely determines the cumulative
error rate for arbitrary readout noise. Importantly, this universal description persists for
the small number of repetitions and non-QND imperfections relevant to real experiments. It follows
that arbitrary non-Gaussian readout noise common in experiments can be replaced by effective Gaussian
noise with the same Chernoff information. This correspondence leads to a simple universal expression
to estimate the cumulative error rate of a QND readout. In addition, the Chernoff information is
used to rigorously quantify the amount of information discarded by analog-to-binary conversion.
These results provide a unified framework for qubit readout and should facilitate optimization
and engineering of near-term quantum devices across all platforms.
