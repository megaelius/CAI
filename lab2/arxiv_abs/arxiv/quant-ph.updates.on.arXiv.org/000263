The Kitaev honeycomb model is an approximate topological quantum error correcting code in the same
phase as the toric code, but requiring only a 2-body Hamiltonian. As a frustrated spin model, it is
well outside the commuting models of topological quantum codes that are typically studied, but
its exact solubility makes it more amenable to analysis of effects arising in this noncommutative
setting than a generic topologically ordered Hamiltonian. Here we study quantum error correction
in the honeycomb model using both analytic and numerical techniques. We first prove explicit exponential
bounds on the approximate degeneracy, local indistinguishability, and correctability of the
code space. These bounds are tighter than can be achieved using known general properties of topological
phases. Our proofs are specialized to the honeycomb model, but some of the methods may nonetheless
be of broader interest. Following this, we numerically study noise caused by thermalization processes
in the perturbative regime close to the toric code renormalization group fixed point. The appearance
of non-topological excitations in this setting has no significant effect on the error correction
properties of the honeycomb model in the regimes we study. Although the behavior of this model is
found to be qualitatively similar to that of the standard toric code in most regimes, we find numerical
evidence of an interesting effect in the low-temperature, finite-size regime where a preferred
lattice direction emerges and anyon diffusion is geometrically constrained. We expect this effect
to yield an improvement in the scaling of the lifetime with system size as compared to the standard
toric code.
