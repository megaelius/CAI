Quantum algorithm design usually assumes access to a perfect quantum computer with ideal properties
like full connectivity, noise-freedom and arbitrarily long coherence time. In Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices, however, the number of qubits is highly limited and quantum operation error
and qubit coherence are not negligible. Besides, the connectivity of physical qubits in a quantum
processing unit (QPU) is also strictly constrained. Thereby, additional operations like SWAP
gates have to be inserted to satisfy this constraint while preserving the functionality of the original
circuit. This process is known as quantum circuit transformation. Adding additional gates will
increase both the size and depth of a quantum circuit and therefore cause further decay of the performance
of a quantum circuit. Thus it is crucial to minimize the number of added gates. In this paper, we propose
an efficient method to solve this problem. We first choose by using simulated annealing an initial
mapping which fits well with the input circuit and then, with the help of a heuristic cost function,
stepwise apply the best selected SWAP gates until all quantum gates in the circuit can be executed.
Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in all parameters including the size and the qubit number of
the input circuit, and the qubit number in the QPU. Its space complexity is quadratic to the number
of edges in the QPU. Experimental results on extensive realistic circuits confirm that the proposed
method is efficient and can reduce by 57% on average the size of the output circuits when compared
with the state-of-the-art algorithm on the most recent IBM quantum device viz. IBM Q20 (Tokyo).
