Entanglement is an essential resource in many quantum information tasks and entanglement witness
is a widely used tool for its detection. In experiments the prepared state generally deviates from
the target state due to some noise. Normally the white noise model is applied to quantifying such
derivation and in the same time reveals the robustness of the witness. However, there may exist other
kind of noise, in which the coherent noise can dramatically "rotate" the prepared state. In this
way, the coherent noise is likely to lead to a failure of the detection, even though the underlying
state is actually entangled. In this work, we propose an efficient entanglement detection protocol
for $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states. The protocol can eliminate
the effect of the coherent noise and in the same time feedback the corresponding noise parameters,
which are beneficial to further improvements on the experiment system. In particular, we consider
two experiment-relevant coherent noise models, one is from the unconscious phase accumulation
on $N$ qubits, the other is from the rotation on the control qubit. The protocol effectively realizes
a family of entanglement witnesses by postprocessing the measurement results from $N+2$ local
measurement settings, which only adds one more setting than the original witness specialized for
the GHZ state. Moreover, by considering the trade-off between the detection efficiency and the
white-noise robustness, we further reduce the number of local measurements to 3 without altering
the performance on the coherent noise. Our protocol can enhance the entanglement detection under
coherent noises and act as a benchmark for the state-of-the-art quantum devices.
