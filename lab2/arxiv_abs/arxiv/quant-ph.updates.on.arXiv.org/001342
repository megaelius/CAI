We introduce a microwave-assisted spectroscopy technique to determine the relative concentrations
of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that are negatively-charged (NV${}^-$) and neutrally-charged
(NV${}^0$), and present its application to studying spin-dependent ionization in NV ensembles
and enhancing NV-magnetometer sensitivity. Our technique is based on selectively modulating
the NV${}^-$ fluorescence with a spin-state-resonant microwave drive to isolate, in-situ, the
spectral shape of the NV${}^-$ and NV${}^0$ contributions to an NV-ensemble sample's fluorescence.
As well as serving as a reliable means to characterize charge state ratio, the method can be used as
a tool to study spin-dependent ionization in NV ensembles. As an example, we applied the microwave
technique to a high-NV-density diamond sample and found evidence for a new spin-dependent ionization
pathway, which we present here alongside a rate-equation model of the data. We further show that
our method can be used to enhance the contrast of optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
on NV ensembles and may lead to significant sensitivity gains in NV magnetometers dominated by technical
noise sources, especially where the NV${}^0$ population is large. With the high-NV-density diamond
sample investigated here, we demonstrate up to a 4.8-fold enhancement in ODMR contrast. The techniques
presented here may also be applied to other solid-state defects whose fluorescence can be selectively
modulated by means of a microwave drive. We demonstrate this utility by applying our method to isolate
room-temperature spectral signatures of the V2-type silicon vacancy from an ensemble of V1 and
V2 silicon vacancies in 4H silicon carbide.
