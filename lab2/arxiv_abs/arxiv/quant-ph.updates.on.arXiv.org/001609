We describe a general procedure for associating a minimal informationally-complete quantum measurement
(or MIC) and a set of linearly independent post-measurement quantum states with a purely probabilistic
representation of the Born Rule. Such representations are motivated by QBism, where the Born Rule
is understood as a consistency condition between probabilities assigned to the outcomes of one
experiment in terms of the probabilities assigned to the outcomes of other experiments. In this
setting, the difference between quantum and classical physics is the way their physical assumptions
augment bare probability theory: Classical physics corresponds to a trivial augmentation---one
just applies the Law of Total Probability (LTP) between the scenarios---while quantum theory makes
use of the Born Rule expressed in one or another of the forms of our general procedure. To mark the irreducible
difference between quantum and classical, one should seek the representations that minimize the
disparity between the expressions. We prove that the representation of the Born Rule obtained from
a symmetric informationally-complete measurement (or SIC) minimizes this distinction in at least
two senses---the first to do with unitarily invariant distance measures between the rules, and
the second to do with available volume in a reference probability simplex (roughly speaking a new
kind of uncertainty principle). Both of these arise from a significant majorization result. This
work complements recent studies in quantum computation where the deviation of the Born Rule from
the LTP is measured in terms of negativity of Wigner functions.
