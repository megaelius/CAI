The out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have been proposed and widely used recently as a tool
to define and describe many-body quantum chaos. Here, we develop the Keldysh non-linear sigma model
technique to calculate these correlators in interacting disordered metals. In particular, we
focus on the regularized and unregularized OTOCs, defined as $Tr[\sqrt{\rho} A(t) \sqrt{\rho}
A^\dagger(t)]$ and $Tr[\rho A(t)A^\dagger(t)]$ respectively (where $A(t)$ is the anti-commutator
of fermion field operators and $\rho$ is the thermal density matrix). The calculation of the rate
of OTOCs' exponential growth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals,
but here it involves two replicas of the system (two "worlds"). The intra-world contributions reproduce
the dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the correlator), while the inter-world terms
provide a term of the opposite sign that exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and
unregularized OTOCs grow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding
many-body Lyapunov exponents are different. For the regularized correlator, we reproduce an earlier
perturbation theory result for the Lyapunov exponent that satisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford
bound. However, the Lyapunov exponent of the unregularized correlator parametrically exceeds
the bound. We argue that the latter is not a reliable indicator of many body quantum chaos as it contains
additional contributions from elastic scattering events due to virtual processes that should
not contribute to many-body chaos. These results bring up an important general question of the physical
meaning of the OTOCs often used in calculations and proofs. We briefly discuss possible connections
of the OTOCs to observables in quantum interference effects and level statistics via a many-body
analogue of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture.
