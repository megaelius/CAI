Sharing information coherently between nodes of a quantum network is at the foundation of distributed
quantum information processing. In this scheme, the computation is divided into subroutines and
performed on several smaller quantum registers connected by classical and quantum channels. A
direct quantum channel, which connects nodes deterministically, rather than probabilistically,
is advantageous for fault-tolerant quantum computation because it reduces the threshold requirements
and can achieve larger entanglement rates. Here, we implement deterministic state transfer and
entanglement protocols between two superconducting qubits fabricated on separate chips. Superconducting
circuits constitute a universal quantum node capable of sending, receiving, storing, and processing
quantum information. Our implementation is based on an all-microwave cavity-assisted Raman process
which entangles or transfers the qubit state of a transmon-type artificial atom to a time-symmetric
itinerant single photon. We transfer qubit states at a rate of $50 \, \rm{kHz}$ using the emitted
photons which are absorbed at the receiving node with a probability of $98.1 \pm 0.1 \%$ achieving
a transfer process fidelity of $80.02 \pm 0.07 \%$. We also prepare on demand remote entanglement
with a fidelity as high as $78.9 \pm 0.1 \%$. Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical
simulations based on a master equation description of the system. This deterministic quantum protocol
has the potential to be used as a backbone of surface code quantum error correction across different
nodes of a cryogenic network to realize large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation in the
circuit quantum electrodynamic architecture.
