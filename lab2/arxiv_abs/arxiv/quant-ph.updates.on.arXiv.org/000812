For quantum key distribution (QKD) with finite-size effects, parameter optimization - the choice
of intensities and probabilities of sending them - is a crucial step to gain optimal performance.
Traditionally, such an optimization relies on brute-force search, or local search algorithm such
as Coordinate Descent. Here we present a new method of using a neural network to learn to predict the
optimal point for the convex optimization of parameters for QKD with any given set of experiment
devices and quantum channel conditions. Selecting one protocol (symmetric 4-intensity measurement-device-independent
QKD) as an example, we show that with neural-network-predicted parameters we can achieve over 99.99%
of the optimal key rate. Harnessing the parallel processing power of a graphical processing unit
(GPU), the neural network allows us to efficiently pre-generate on a desktop PC a large "look-up
table" of optimal parameters for all possible experimental parameter and channel conditions,
up to a finite resolution, and deploy this table to low-power devices. This eliminates the need for
any on-device computation, and allows us to deploy finite-size QKD with optimal parameter setting
to low-power mobile QKD devices that have limited computing power, short communication time, and
quickly changing channel losses and experimental parameters (e.g. misalignment and background
noise), such as in satellite, drone, or handheld QKD systems. We show that, on a Raspberry Pi 3 single-board
computer, using look-up table is up to 15-25 times faster than local search. In addition to the look-up
table method, we also point out the potential to directly deploy neural networks to an increasing
number of mobile devices equipped with neural processing units for real-time fast parameter optimization.
