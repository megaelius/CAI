The local Hamiltonian problem consists of estimating the ground-state energy (given by the minimum
eigenvalue) of a local quantum Hamiltonian. First, we show the existence of a good product-state
approximation for the ground-state energy of 2-local Hamiltonians with one or more of the following
properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state with sublinear entanglement
with respect to some partition into small pieces. The approximation based on degree is a surprising
difference between quantum Hamiltonians and classical CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems),
since in the classical setting, higher degree is usually associated with harder CSPs. The approximation
based on low entanglement, in turn, was previously known only in the regime where the entanglement
was close to zero. Since the existence of a low-energy product state can be checked in NP, the result
implies that any Hamiltonian used for a quantum PCP theorem should have: (1) constant degree, (2)
constant expansion, (3) a "volume law" for entanglement with respect to any partition into small
parts. Second, we show that in several cases, good product-state approximations not only exist,
but can be found in polynomial time: (1) 2-local Hamiltonians on any planar graph, solving an open
problem of Bansal, Bravyi, and Terhal, (2) dense k-local Hamiltonians for any constant k, solving
an open problem of Gharibian and Kempe, and (3) 2-local Hamiltonians on graphs with low threshold
rank, via a quantum generalization of a recent result of Barak, Raghavendra and Steurer. Our work
introduces two new tools which may be of independent interest. First, we prove a new quantum version
of the de Finetti theorem which does not require the usual assumption of symmetry. Second, we describe
a way to analyze the application of the Lasserre/Parrilo SDP hierarchy to local quantum Hamiltonians.
