We consider the time evolution of mixed state correlation measures in two-dimensional conformal
field theories, such as logarithmic negativity, odd entropy, and reflected entropy, after quantum
quenches of various kinds. These correlation measures, in the holographic context, are all associated
to the entanglement wedge cross section. We contrast various classes of conformal field theories,
both rational and irrational (pure) conformal field theories. First, for rational conformal field
theories, whose dynamics can be well described by the quasi-particle picture, we find all four quantities
for disjoint intervals to be proportional, regardless of the specific quench protocol. Second,
using the light cone bootstrap, we generalize our results to irrational conformal field theories
where we find sharp distinctions from the quasi-particle results and striking differences between
mutual information and the other measures. The large surplus of logarithmic negativity relative
to mutual information forces us to reconsider what mutual information and logarithmic negativity
really measure. We interpret these results as a signature of information scrambling and chaos in
irrational theories. These CFT results perfectly agree with our gravitational (holographic)
calculations. Furthermore, using holography, we are able to generalize the results to outside
of the light cone limit. Finally, due to the breakdown of the quasi-particle picture for irrational
theories, we appeal to the "line-tension picture," motivated by random unitary circuits, as a phenomenological
description. We observe that random unitary circuits, with local Hilbert space dimension determined
by the Cardy formula, have precisely the same entanglement dynamics as irrational (including holographic)
conformal field theories.
