The reduced dynamics of an open quantum system obtained from an underlying microscopic Hamiltonian
can in general only approximately be described by a time local master equation. The quality of that
approximation depends primarily on the coupling strength and the structure of the environment.
Various such master equations have been proposed with different aims. Choosing the most suitable
one for a specific system is not straight forward. By focusing on the accuracy of the reduced dynamics
we provide a thorough assessment for a selection of methods (Redfield Equation, Quantum Optical
Master Equation, Coarse-Grained Master Equation, a related dynamical map approach and a partial-secular
approximation). Whether or not an approach guarantees positivity we consider secondary, here.
We use two qubits coupled to a Lorentzian environment in a spin-boson like fashion modeling a generic
situation with various system and bath time scales. We see that, independent of the initial state,
the simple Redfield Equation with time dependent coefficients is significantly more accurate
than all other methods under consideration. We emphasize that positivity violation in the Redfield
formalism becomes relevant only in a regime where any of the perturbative master equations considered
here are rendered invalid anyway. This implies that the loss of positivity should in fact be welcomed
as an important feature: it indicates the breakdown of the weak coupling assumption. In addition
we present the various approaches in a self-contained way and use the behavior of their errors to
provide further insight into the range of validity of each method.
