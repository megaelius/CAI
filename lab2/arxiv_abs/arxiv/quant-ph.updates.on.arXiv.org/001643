A different approach towards quantum theory is proposed in this paper. The basis is taken to be conceptual
variables, physical variables that may be accessible or inaccessible, i.e., it may be possible
or impossible to assign numerical values to them. In an epistemic process, the accessible variables
are just ideal observations as observed by an actor or by some communicating actors. Group actions
are defined on these variables, and using group representation theory this is the basis for developing
the Hilbert space formalism here. Operators corresponding to accessible conceptual variables
are derived as a result of the formalism, and in the discrete case it is argued that the possible physical
values are the eigenvalues of these operators. The Born formula is derived under specific assumptions.
The whole discussion here is a supplement to the author's book [1]. The interpretation of quantum
states (or eigenvector spaces) implied by this approach is as focused questions to nature together
with sharp answers to those questions. Resolutions if the identity are then connected to the questions
themselves; these may be complementary in the sense defined by Bohr. This interpretation may be
called a general epistemic interpretation of quantum theory. It is similar to Zwirn's recent Convival
Solipsism, and also to QBism, and more generally, can be seen as a concrete implementation of Rovelli's
Relational Quantum Mechanics. The focus in the present paper is, however, as much on foundation
as on interpretation. But the simple consequences of an epistemic interpretation for some so called
quantum paradoxes are discussed. Connections to statistical inference theory are discussed in
a preliminary way, both through an example and through a brief discussion of quantum measurement
theory.
