In this article, non-classical properties of Raman modes are investigated. The original goal,
actually, is to identify how and by which method we can induce non-classicality in Raman modes. We
introduce a plasmonic system in which Raman dye molecules are buried between two shells of the plasmonic
materials similar to onion-like core/shell nanoparticle. This system is excited by the entangled
photons, followed by analyzing its dynamics of motion using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations
by which the time evolution of the signal-idler mode and Raman modes are derived. Interestingly,
the entangled photons are coupled to the plasmonic modes which are used to improve the non-classicality.
It is shown that the exciting system with the entangled photons lead to inducing the non-classicality
in Raman modes and entanglement between them. This behavior is attributed to the non-classicality
of input modes that is coupled to the Raman modes considering the correlation between the incident
wave frequency and Raman modes frequency. Notably, these quantum properties are dramatically
affected by the environment temperature and Raman molecules location around the plasmonic nanoparticles.
Modelling results demonstrate that a temperature increase has a drastic effect on system dynamics.
Moreover, it is found that the entanglement between modes in system surely is affected by the coupling
between the incident modes and plasmonic modes generated by the core/shell nanoparticles. Finally,
as an important result, it is revealed that the Raman modes such as stoke and anti-stoke modes show
a revival behavior, which is a quantum phenomenon.
