Quantum copy-protection is an innovative idea that uses the no-cloning property of quantum information
to copy-protect programs and was first put forward by \cite{aaronson2009quantum}. The general
goal is that a program distributor can distribute a quantum state $|\Psi\rangle$, whose classical
description is secret to the users; a user can use this state to run the program P on his own input, but
not be able to pirate this program P or create another state with the same functionality. In the copy-protection
with oracle setting, the user has access to a public oracle and can use the given quantum state and
the oracle to compute on his/her own input for polynomially many times. However, the user is not able
to produce an additional program(quantum or classical) that computes the same as P on almost all
inputs. We present a first quantum copy protection scheme with a classical oracle for any unlearnable
function families. The construction is based on membership oracles for hidden subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$,
an idea derived from the public key quantum money scheme in \cite{aaronson2012quantum}. We prove
the security of the scheme relative to a classical oracle, namely, the subspace membership oracle
with the functionality of computing the secret function we want to copy-protect. The security proof
builds on the quantum lower bound for the Direct-Product problem (\cite{aaronson2012quantum,ben2016quantum})
and the quantum unlearnability of the copy-protected functions. We also show that existence of
quantum copy protection and the quantum hardness of Learning-with-Errors (LWE) will imply publicly
verifiable quantum money.
