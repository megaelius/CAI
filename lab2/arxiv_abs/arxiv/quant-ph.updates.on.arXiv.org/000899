In quantum physics the term `contextual' can be used in more than one way. One usage, here called `Bell
contextual' since the idea goes back to Bell, is that if $A$, $B$ and $C$ are three quantum observables,
with $A$ compatible (i.e., commuting) with $B$ and also with $C$, whereas $B$ and $C$ are incompatible,
a measurement of $A$ might yield a different result (indicating that quantum mechanics is contextual)
depending upon whether $A$ is measured along with $B$ (the $\{A,B\}$ context) or with $C$ (the $\{A,C\}$
context). An analysis of what projective quantum measurements measure shows that quantum theory
is Bell noncontextual: the outcome of a particular $A$ measurement when $A$ is measured along with
$B$ would have been exactly the same if $A$ had, instead, been measured along with $C$. A different
definition found in Samson Abramsky et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 119:050504, 2017, here called `globally
(non)contextual' to distinguish it from the Bell variety, refers to whether there is (`noncontextual'),
or is not (`contextual'), an 'empirical model' that simultaneously assigns probabilities in a
consistent manner to the outcomes of measurements of a certain collection of observables, not all
of which are compatible. A simple example shows that an empirical model can exist even in a situation
where the (supposed) measurement probabilities cannot refer to properties of a quantum system,
and hence lack physical significance, even though mathematically well-defined. It is noted that
the quantum sample space required for interpreting measurements of incompatible properties in
separate runs of an experiment has a tensor product structure, a fact sometimes overlooked.
