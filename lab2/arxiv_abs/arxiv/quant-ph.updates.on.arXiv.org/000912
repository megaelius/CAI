To describe charged particles interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field, we point
out the differences of working in the so-called generalized and the true Coulomb gauges. We find
an explicit gauge transformation between them for the case of the electromagnetic field operators
quantized near a macroscopic boundary described by a piece-wise constant dielectric function.
Starting from the generalized Coulomb gauge we transform operators into the true Coulomb gauge
where the vector potential operator is truly transverse everywhere. We find the generating function
of the gauge transformation to carry out the corresponding unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian
and show that in the true Coulomb gauge the Hamiltonian of a particle near a polarizable surface contains
extra terms due to the fluctuating surface charge density induced by the vacuum field. This extra
term is represented by a second-quantised operator on equal footing with the vector field operators.
We demonstrate that this term contains part of the electrostatic energy of the charged particle
interacting with the surface and that the gauge invariance of the theory guarantees that the total
interaction energy in all cases equals the well known result obtainable by the method of images when
working in generalized Coulomb gauge. The mathematical tools we have developed allow us to work
out explicitly the equal-time commutation relations and shed some light on typical misconceptions
regarding issues of whether the presence of the boundaries should affect the field commutators
or not, especially when the boundaries are modelled as perfect reflectors.
