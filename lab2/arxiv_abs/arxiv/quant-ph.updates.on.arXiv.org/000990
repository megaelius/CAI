Wallstrom's criticism of existing formulations of stochastic mechanics is that they fail to derive
the empirical predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics because they require an ad hoc quantization
condition on the postulated velocity potential, \emph{S}, in order to derive Schr\"odinger wave
functions. We propose an answer to this criticism by modifying the Nelson-Yasue formulation of
non-relativistic stochastic mechanics for a spinless particle with the following hypothesis:
a spinless Nelson-Yasue particle of rest mass $m$ continuously undergoes a driven steady-state
oscillation of `zitterbewegung' (\emph{zbw}) frequency, $\omega_{c}=\left(1/\hbar\right)mc^{2}$,
in its instantaneous mean forward (and backward) translational rest frame. With this hypothesis
we show that, in the lab frame, \emph{S} arises from imposing the constraint of conservative diffusions
on the time-symmetrized steady-state phase of the \emph{zbw} particle, satisfies the required
quantization condition, and evolves in time by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations (when
generalized to describe a statistical ensemble of \emph{zbw} particles). From the mathematical
equivalence of Schr\"odinger's equation with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations plus the
quantization condition, Schr\"odinger wave functions for a spinless particle (in and excluding
external fields) are thereby recovered. We also apply this `zitterbewegung stochastic mechanics'
(ZSM) to the case of a central potential and show that it predicts angular momentum quantization.
This paper sets the foundation for Part II, which will (primarily) work out the many-particle version
of ZSM.
