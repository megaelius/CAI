Quantum physics can only make statistical predictions about possible measurement outcomes, and
these predictions originate from an operator algebra that is fundamentally different from the
conventional definition of probability as a subjective lack of information regarding the physical
reality of the system. In the present paper, I explore how the operator formalism accommodates the
vast number of possible states and measurements by characterizing its essential function as a description
of causality relations between initial conditions and subsequent observations. It is shown that
any complete description of causality must involve non-positive statistical elements that cannot
be associated with any directly observable effects. The necessity of non-positive elements is
demonstrated by the uniquely defined mathematical description of ideal correlations which explains
the physics of maximally entangled states, quantum teleportation and quantum cloning. The operator
formalism thus modifies the concept of causality by providing a universally valid description
of deterministic relations between initial states and subsequent observations that cannot be
expressed in terms of directly observable measurement outcomes. Instead, the identifiable elements
of causality are necessarily non-positive and hence unobservable. The validity of the operator
algebra therefore indicates that a consistent explanation of the various uncertainty limited
phenomena associated with physical objects is only possible if we learn to accept the fact that the
elements of causality cannot be reconciled with a continuation of observable reality in the physical
object.
