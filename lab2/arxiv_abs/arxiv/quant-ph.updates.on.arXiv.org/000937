Purcell-enhanced emission from a coupled emitter-cavity system is a fundamental manifestation
of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Starting from a theoretical description we derive a scheme
for photon emission from an emitter coupled to a birefringent cavity that exceeds hitherto anticipated
limitations. Based on a recent study and experimental investigation of the intra-cavity coupling
of orthogonal polarisation modes in birefringent cavities, we now decouple the emitter and the
photon prior to emission from the cavity mode. Effectively, this is "hiding" the emitter from the
photon in the cavity to suppress re-excitation, increasing the overall emission through the cavity
mirrors. In doing so we show that tailored cavity birefringence can offer significant advantages
and that these are practically achievable within the bounds of present-day technology. It is found
that birefringence can mitigate the tradeoff between stronger emitter-cavity coupling and efficient
photon extraction. This allows for longer cavities to be constructed without a loss of performance
-- a significant result for applications where dielectric mirrors interfere with any trapping
fields confining the emitter. We then generalise our model to consider a variety of equivalent schemes.
For instance, detuning a pair of ground states in a three-level emitter coupled to a cavity in a Lambda-system
is shown to provide the same enhancement, and it can be combined with a birefringent cavity to further
increase performance. Additionally, it is found that when directly connecting multiple ground
states of the emitter to form a chain of coupled states, the extraction efficiency approaches its
fundamental upper limit. The principles proposed in this work can be applied in multiple ways to
any emitter-cavity system, paving the way to surpassing the traditional limits of such systems
with technologies that exist today.
