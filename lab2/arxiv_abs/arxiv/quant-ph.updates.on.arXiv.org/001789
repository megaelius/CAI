Unlike quantum correlations, the sharability of classical correlations (CCs) between two-parties
of a multipartite state is assumed to be free since there exist states for which CCs for each of the
reduced states can simultaneously reach their algebraic maximum value. However, when one randomly
picks out states from the state space, we find that the probability of obtaining those states possessing
the algebraic maximum value is vanishingly small. We explore the possibility of nontrivial upper
bound by Haar uniformly generating random multipartite states and computing the frequency distribution
for various CC measures, conventional classical correlators, and two axiomatic measures of classical
correlations, namely the classical part of quantum discord and local work of work-deficit. We find
that the distributions are typically Gaussian-like and their standard deviations decrease with
the increase in number of parties. It also reveals that among the multiqubit random states, most
of the reduced density matrices possess a low amount of CCs which can also be confirmed by the mean
of the distributions, thereby showing a kind of restrictions on the sharability of classical correlations
for random states. Furthermore, we also notice that the maximal value for random states is much lower
than the algebraic maxima obtained for a set of states, and the gap between the two increases further
for states with a higher number of parties. We report that for a higher number of parties, the classical
part of quantum discord and local work can follow monogamy-based upper bound on sharability while
classical correlators have a different upper bound. The trends of sharability for classical correlation
measures in random states clearly demarcate between the axiomatic definition of classical correlations
and the conventional ones.
