Contextuality is a particular quantum phenomenon that has no analogue in classical probability
theory. Given two independent systems, a natural question is how to represent such a situation as
a single test space. In other words, how separate contextuality scenarios combine into a joint scenario.
Under the premise that the the allowed probabilistic models satisfy the No Signalling principle,
Foulis and Randall defined the unique possible way to compose two contextuality scenarios. When
composing strictly-more than two test spaces, however, a variety of possible composition methods
have been conceived. Nevertheless, all these formally-distinct composition methods appear to
give rise to observationally equivalent scenarios, in the sense that the different compositions
all allow precisely the same sets of classical and quantum probabilistic models. This raises the
question of whether this property of invariance-under-composition-method is special to classical
and quantum probabilistic models, or if it generalizes to other probabilistic models as well, our
particular focus being $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models. $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models are physically important
since, when applied to scenarios constructed by a particular composition rule, coincide with the
well-defined "Almost Quantum Correlations". In this work we see that some composition rules, however,
give rise to scenarios with inequivalent allowed sets of $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models. We find that the
non-trivial dependence of $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models on the choice of composition method is apparently
an artifact of failure of those composition rules to capture the orthogonality relations given
by the Local Orthogonality principle. We prove that $\mathcal{Q}_1$ models satisfy invariance-under-composition-method
for all the constructive compositions protocols which do capture this notion of Local Orthogonality.
