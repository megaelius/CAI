The study of dissipation and decoherence in generic open quantum systems recently led to the investigation
of spectral and steady-state properties of random Lindbladian dynamics. A natural question is
then how realistic and universal those properties are. Here, we address these issues by considering
a different description of dissipative quantum systems, namely the discrete-time Kraus map representation
of completely positive quantum dynamics. Through random matrix theory (RMT) techniques and numerical
exact diagonalization, we study random Kraus maps, allowing for a varying dissipation strength,
and their local circuit counterpart. We find the spectrum of the random Kraus map to be either an annulus
or a disk inside the unit circle in the complex plane, with a transition between the two cases taking
place at a critical value of dissipation strength. The eigenvalue distribution and the spectral
transition are well described by a simplified RMT model that we can solve exactly in the thermodynamic
limit, by means of non-Hermitian RMT and quaternionic free probability. The steady-state, on the
contrary, is not affected by the spectral transition. It has, however, a perturbative crossover
regime at small dissipation, inside which the steady-state is characterized by uncorrelated eigenvalues.
At large dissipation (or for any dissipation for a large-enough system) the steady-state is well
described by a random Wishart matrix. The steady-state properties thus coincide with those already
observed for random Lindbladian dynamics, indicating their universality. Quite remarkably,
the statistical properties of the local Kraus circuit are qualitatively the same as those of the
nonlocal Kraus map, indicating that the latter, which is more tractable, already captures the realistic
and universal physical properties of generic open quantum systems.
