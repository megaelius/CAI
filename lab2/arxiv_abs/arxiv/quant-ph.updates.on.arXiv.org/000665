Standard quantum process tomography on a $d$-dimensional input is performed by preparing several
states of an input probe that then evolve under the action of the quantum channel corresponding to
the progress. The final states of the probe are reconstructed by means of state tomography. An alternative
is offered by ancilla-assisted process tomography: a single probe-ancilla state is used, and the
correlations existing between probe and ancilla are exploited to fully reconstruct the information
on the channel. In order for ancilla-assisted process tomography to be possible, the probe-ancilla
input state does not need to be entangled, but still needs to have maximal operator Schmidt rank.
Here we establish and analyze a framework for process tomography that interpolates between these
two methods, aiming at exploiting any correlations that may exist between probe and ancilla to allow
process tomography with as few input preparations as possible, when the probe-ancilla state may
be operator-Schmidt-rank deficient. The main object of our investigation is the minimal number
of initial local operations on the input probe for a given starting probe-ancilla state that are
needed to allow process tomography. We prove that such a number scales inversely proportional to
the operator Schmidt rank of the input probe-ancilla state for arbitrary local input processing.
We also provide results for the case where this initial local processing is restricted to be a unitary
rotation, in particular showing that the mentioned scaling is satisfied for pure input entangled
states, and that in the case of mixed states there might be extreme cases where the fixed input probe-ancilla
state provides information on a $\approx d^2/2$-dimensional subspace of the operator space and
a single additional input unitary rotation allows process tomography.
