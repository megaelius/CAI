Spin-orbit coupling fundamentally alters spin qubits, opening pathways to improve the scalability
of quantum computers via long distance coupling mediated by electric fields, photons, or phonons.
It also allows for new engineered hybrid and topological quantum systems. However, spin qubits
with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling are not yet viable for quantum technologies due to their short
($\sim1~\mu$s) coherence times $T_2$, while qubits with long $T_2$ have weak spin-orbit coupling
making qubit coupling short-ranged and challenging for scale-up. Here we show that an intrinsic
spin-orbit coupled "generalised spin" with total angular momentum $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$, which is
defined by holes bound to boron dopant atoms in strained $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$, has $T_2$ rivalling
the electron spins of donors and quantum dots in $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$. Using pulsed electron paramagnetic
resonance, we obtain $0.9~\mathrm{ms}$ Hahn-echo and $9~\mathrm{ms}$ dynamical decoupling
$T_2$ times, where strain plays a key role to reduce spin-lattice relaxation and the longitudinal
electric coupling responsible for decoherence induced by electric field noise. Our analysis shows
that transverse electric dipole can be exploited for electric manipulation and qubit coupling
while maintaining a weak longitudinal coupling, a feature of $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$ atomic systems
with a strain engineered quadrupole degree of freedom. These results establish single-atom hole
spins in silicon with quantised total angular momentum, not spin, as a highly coherent platform
with tuneable intrinsic spin-orbit coupling advantageous to build artificial quantum systems
and couple qubits over long distances.
