Electron correlations in molecules can be divided in short range dynamical correlations, long
range Van der Waals type interactions and near degeneracy static correlations. In this work we analyze
for a two-electron system how these three types of correlations can be incorporated in a simple wave
function of restricted functional form consisting of an orbital product multiplied by a single
correlation function $f(r_{12})$ depending on the interelectronic distance $r_{12}$. Since
the three types of correlations mentioned lead to different signatures in terms of the natural orbital
(NO) amplitudes in two-electron systems we make an analysis of the wave function in terms of the NO
amplitudes for a model system of a diatomic molecule. In our numerical implementation we fully optimize
the orbitals and the correlation function on a spatial grid without restrictions on their functional
form. Due to this particular form of the wave function, we can prove that none of the amplitudes vanishes
and moreover that it displays a distinct sign pattern and a series of avoided crossings as a function
of the bond distance in agreement which the exact solution. This shows that the wave function Ansatz
correctly incorporates the long range Van der Waals interactions. We further show that the approximate
wave function gives an excellent binding curve and is able to describe static correlations. We show
that in order to do this the correlation function $f(r_{12})$ needs to diverge for large $r_{12}$
at large internuclear distances while for shorter bond distances it increases as a function of $r_{12}$
to a maximum value after which it decays exponentially. We further give a physical interpretation
of this behavior.
