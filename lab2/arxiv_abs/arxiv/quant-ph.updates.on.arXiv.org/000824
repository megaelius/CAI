Recently, an operational characterization of nonclassicality of unsteerable correlations has
been given by a notion called superunsteerability, the requirement for a larger dimension of the
classical variable that the steering party has to preshare with the trusted party for simulating
the correlations than that of the quantum states which reproduce them. In this work, we propose a
quantifier of superunsteerability and obtain analytical expressions of this quantifier for the
Bell-diagonal two-qubit states in the context of two-setting and three-setting steering scenarios.
We explore the implication of our quantifier of nonclassicality beyond steering for the task of
quantum random access codes (RAC) assisted with the Bell-diagonal states. For the quantum $2 \to
1$ and $3 \to 1$ RACs, it has been shown that even certain separable states which have nonzero quantum
discord provides advantage over the best classical protocols assisted with two-bits (instead
of infinite amount) of shared classical randomness. However, quantum discord of the Bell-diagonal
states does not indicate the usefulness of resource for either of these two RACs. This raises the
question which is the precise quantitative resource for quantum RACs in the presence of finite shared
randomness. We affirmatively answer this question by demonstrating that for the quantum RACs assisted
with the Bell-diagonal states in the presence of two-bits of shared classical randomness, the quantifier
of superunsteerability in the two-setting and three-setting scenarios identifies the optimal
separable states for the quantum $2 \to 1$ and $3 \to 1$ RACs respectively.
