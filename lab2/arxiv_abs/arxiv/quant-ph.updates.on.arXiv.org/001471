We study equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of the single-impurity Anderson model with
a power-law pseudogap in the density of states. In equilibrium, the model is known to display a quantum
phase transition from a generalized Kondo to a local moment phase. In the present work, we focus on
the extension of these phases beyond equilibrium, i.e. under the influence of a bias voltage. Within
the auxiliary master equation approach combined with a scheme based on matrix product states (MPS)
we are able to directly address the current-carrying steady state. Starting with the equilibrium
situation, we first corroborate our results by comparing with a direct numerical evaluation of
ground state spectral properties of the system by MPS. Here, a scheme to locate the phase boundary
by extrapolating the power-law exponent of the self energy produces a very good agreement with previous
results obtained by the numerical renormalization group. Our nonequilibrium study as a function
of the applied bias voltage is then carried out for two points on either side of the phase boundary.
In the Kondo regime the resonance in the spectral function is splitted as a function of the increasing
bias voltage. The local moment regime, instead, displays a dip in the spectrum near the position
of the chemical potentials. Similar features are observed in the corresponding self energies.
The Kondo split peaks approximately obey a power-law behavior as a function of frequency, whose
exponents depend only slightly on voltage. Finally, the differential conductance in the Kondo
regime shows a peculiar maximum at finite voltages, whose height, however, is below the accuracy
level.
