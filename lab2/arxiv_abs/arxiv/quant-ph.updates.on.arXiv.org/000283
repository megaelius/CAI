Quantum criticality usually occurs in many-body systems. Recently it was shown that the quantum
Rabi model, which describes a two-level atom coupled to a single model cavity field, presents quantum
phase transitions from a normal phase to a superradiate phase when the ratio between the frequency
of the two level atom and the frequency of the cavity field extends to infinity. In this work, we study
quantum phase transitions in the quantum Rabi model from the fidelity susceptibility perspective.
We found that the fidelity susceptibility and the generalized adiabatic susceptibility present
universal finite size scaling behaviors near the quantum critical point of the Rabi model if the
ratio between frequency of the two level atom and frequency of the cavity field is finite. From the
finite size scaling analysis of the fidelity susceptibility, we found that the adiabatic dimension
of the fidelity susceptibility and the generalized adiabatic susceptibility of fourth order in
the Rabi model are $4/3$ and $2$, respectively. Meanwhile the correlation length critical exponent
and the dynamical critical exponent in the quantum critical point of the Rabi model are found to be
$3/2$ and $1/3$ respectively. Since the fidelity susceptibility and the generalized adiabatic
susceptibility are the moments of the quantum noise spectrum which is directly measurable by experiments
in linear response regime, the scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility in the Rabi model
could be tested experimentally. The simple structure of the quantum Rabi model paves the way for
experimentally observing the universal scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility at a quantum
phase transition.
