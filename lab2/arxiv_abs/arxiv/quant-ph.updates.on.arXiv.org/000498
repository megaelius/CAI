We show that given an explicit description of a multiplayer game, with a classical verifier and a
constant number of players, it is QMA-hard, under randomized reductions, to distinguish between
the cases when the players have a strategy using entanglement that succeeds with probability 1 in
the game, or when no such strategy succeeds with probability larger than 1/2. This proves the "games
quantum PCP conjecture" of Fitzsimons and the second author (ITCS'15), albeit under randomized
reductions. The core component in our reduction is a construction of a family of two-player games
for testing $n$-qubit maximally entangled states. For any integer $n\geq2$, we give a test in which
questions from the verifier are $O(\log n)$ bits long, and answers are $\mathrm{poly}(\log\log
n)$ bits long. We show that for any constant $\varepsilon\geq0$, any strategy that succeeds with
probability at least $1-\varepsilon$ in the test must use a state that is within distance $O(\varepsilon^c)$
from a state that is locally equivalent to a maximally entangled state on $n$ qubits, for some universal
constant $c>0$. The construction is based on the classical plane-vs-point test for multivariate
low-degree polynomials of Raz and Safra (STOC'97). We extend the classical test to the quantum regime
by executing independent copies of the test in the generalized Pauli $X$ and $Z$ bases over $\mathbb{F}_q$,
where $q$ is a sufficiently large prime power, and combine the two through a test for the Pauli twisted
commutation relations. Our main complexity-theoretic result is obtained by combining this family
of games with constructions of PCPs of proximity introduced by Ben-Sasson et al. (CCC'05), and crucially
relies on a linear property of such PCPs. Another consequence of our results is a deterministic reduction
from the games quantum PCP conjecture to a suitable formulation of the Hamiltonian quantum PCP conjecture.
