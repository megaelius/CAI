A quantum computer, i.e. utilizing the resources of quantum physics, superposition of states and
entanglement, could furnish an exponential gain in computing time. A simulation using such resources
is called a quantum simulation. The advantage of quantum simulations over classical ones is well
established at the theoretical, i.e. software level. Their practical benefit requires their implementation
on a quantum hardware. The quantum computer, i.e. the universal one (see below), has not seen the
light of day yet, but the efforts in this direction are both growing and diverse. Also, quantum simulation
has already been illustrated by numerous experimental proofs of principle, thanks too small-size
and specific-task quantum computers or simulators. Quantum walks are particularly-studied quantum-simulation
schemes, being elementary bricks to conceive any quantum algorithm, i.e. to achieve so-called
universal quantum computation. The present thesis is a step more towards a simulation of quantum
field theories based on discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs). Indeed, it is shown, in certain cases,
how DTQWs can simulate, in the continuum, the action of Yang-Mills gauge fields on fermionic matter,
and the retroaction of the latter on the gauge-field dynamics. The suggested schemes preserve gauge
invariance on the spacetime lattice, i.e. not only in the continuum. In the (1+2)-dimensional Abelian
case, consistent lattice equivalents to both Maxwell's equations and the current conservation
are suggested. In the (1+1)-dimensional non-Abelian case, a lattice version of the non-Abelian
field strength is suggested. Moreover, it is shown how this fermionic matter based on DTQWs can be
coupled to relativistic gravitational fields of the continuum, i.e. to curved spacetimes, in 1+2
dimensions.
