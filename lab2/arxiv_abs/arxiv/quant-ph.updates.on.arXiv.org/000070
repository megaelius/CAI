We use graphical relations in an adynamical, background independent fashion to propose a new approach
to quantum gravity and unification. Accordingly, worldtubes in spacetime are ultimately composed
of fundamental graphical units of space, time and sources (in parlance of quantum field theory),
rather than worldlines in spacetime. These are fundamental elements of space, time and sources,
not source elements in space and time. The transition amplitude for these elements of "spacetimesource"
is computed using a path integral with discrete graphical action. The unit of action for a spacetimesource
element is constructed from a difference matrix K and source vector J on the graph, as in lattice gauge
theory. K is constructed from graphical relations so that it contains a non-trivial null space and
J is then restricted to the row space of K which ensures it is suffused in a divergence-free fashion
with the spacetime defined by the element. This construct of K and J results in a "self-consistency
criterion" for sources, the spacetime metric, and the stress-energy-momentum content of the element,
rather than a dynamical law for time-evolved entities. In its most general form, the set of fundamental
elements employed by lattice gauge theory contains scalar fields on nodes and links, and vector
fields on nodes. To complete the fundamental set (unification in this view), we propose the addition
of scalar fields on plaquettes (basis for graviton) and vector fields on links. In this view, quantum
spacetime is not the graviton in M4, but rather is a field structure over a "micrograph" that underwrites
the graph of K and J. We use this approach via modified Regge calculus to correct proper distance in
the Einstein-deSitter cosmology model yielding a fit of the Union2 Compilation supernova data
that matches LambdaCDM without having to invoke accelerating expansion or dark energy.
