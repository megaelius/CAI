We study approximate quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, which are approximate quantum
error-correcting codes specified as the ground space of a frustration-free local Hamiltonian,
whose terms do not necessarily commute. Such codes generalize stabilizer QLDPC codes, which are
exact quantum error-correcting codes with sparse, low-weight stabilizer generators (i.e. each
stabilizer generator acts on a few qubits, and each qubit participates in a few stabilizer generators).
Our investigation is motivated by an important question in Hamiltonian complexity and quantum
coding theory: do stabilizer QLDPC codes with constant rate, linear distance, and constant-weight
stabilizers exist? We show that obtaining such optimal scaling of parameters (modulo polylogarithmic
corrections) is possible if we go beyond stabilizer codes: we prove the existence of a family of $[[N,k,d,\varepsilon]]$
approximate QLDPC codes that encode $k = \widetilde{\Omega}(N)$ logical qubits into $N$ physical
qubits with distance $d = \widetilde{\Omega}(N)$ and approximation infidelity $\varepsilon
= \mathcal{O}(1/\textrm{polylog}(N))$. The code space is stabilized by a set of 10-local noncommuting
projectors, with each physical qubit only participating in $\mathcal{O}(\textrm{polylog} N)$
projectors. We prove the existence of an efficient encoding map, and we show that arbitrary Pauli
errors can be locally detected by circuits of polylogarithmic depth. Finally, we show that the spectral
gap of the code Hamiltonian is $\widetilde{\Omega}(N^{-3.09})$ by analyzing a spacetime circuit-to-Hamiltonian
construction for a bitonic sorting network architecture that is spatially local in $\textrm{polylog}(N)$
dimensions.
