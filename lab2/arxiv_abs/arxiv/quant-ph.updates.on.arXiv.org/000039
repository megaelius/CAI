Aim of this paper is trying to show the possible significance, and usefulness, of various non-selfadjoint
operators for suitable Observables in non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics,
and in quantum electrodynamics: More specifically, this work starts dealing with: (i) the hermitian
(but not selfadjoint) Time operator in non-relativistic quantum mechanics and in quantum electrodynamics;
with (ii) idem, with the introduction of Time and Space operators; and with (iii) the problem of the
four-position and four-momentum operators, each one with its hermitian and anti-hermitian parts,
for relativistic spin-zero particles. Afterwards, other physical applications of non-selfadjoint
(and even non-hermitian) operators are briefly discussed. We mention how non-hermitian operators
can indeed be used in physics [as it was done, elsewhere, for describing Unstable States]; and some
considerations are added on the cases of the nuclear optical potential, of quantum dissipation,
and in particular of an approach to the measurement problem in QM in terms of a "chronon". [This chapter
is largely based on work developed, along the years, in collaboration with V.S.Olkhovsky, and,
in smaller parts, with P.Smrz, with R.H.A.Farias, and with S.P.Maydanyuk]. PACS numbers: 03.65.Ta;
