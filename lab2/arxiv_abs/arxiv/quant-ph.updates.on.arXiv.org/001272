We introduce a private quantum money scheme with the note verification procedure based on Sampling
Matching, a problem in the one-way communication complexity model introduced by Kumar et al.[Nature
Communications 10, Article number: 4152]. Our scheme involves a Bank that produces and distributes
quantum notes, noteholders who are untrusted and trusted local verifiers of the Bank to whom the
holders send their notes in order to carry out transactions. The key aspects of our money scheme include:
note verification procedure requiring a single round classical interaction between the local
verifier and Bank; fixed verification circuit that uses only passive linear optical components;
re-usability of each note in our scheme which grows linearly with the size of note, and an unconditional
security against any adversary trying to forge the banknote while tolerating the noise of up to 21.4%.
We further describe a practical implementation technique of our money scheme using weak coherent
states of light and the verification circuit involving a single 50/50beam splitter and 2 single-photon
threshold detectors. Previous best-known matching based money scheme proposal [AA17] involves
a verification circuit where the number of optical components increase proportionally to the increase
in desired noise tolerance (robustness). In contrast, we achieve any desired noise tolerance (up
to a maximal threshold value) with only a fixed number of optical components. This considerable
reduction of components in our scheme enables us to reach the robustness values that are not feasible
for any existing money scheme with the current technology.
