Classical one-time-pad key can only be used once. We show in this Letter that with quantum mechanical
information media classical one-time-pad key can be repeatedly used. We propose a specific realization
using single photons. The reason why quantum mechanics can make the classical one-time-pad key
repeatable is that quantum states can not be cloned and eavesdropping can be detected by the legitimate
users. This represents a significant difference between classical cryptography and quantum cryptography
and provides a new tool in designing quantum communication protocols and flexibility in practical
applications. Note added: This work was submitted to PRL as LU9745 on 29 July 2004, and the decision
was returned on 11 November 2004, which advised us to resubmit to some specialized journal, probably,
PRA, after revision. We publish it here in memory of Prof. Fu-Guo Deng (1975.11.12-2019.1.18),
from Beijing Normal University, who died on Jan 18, 2019 after two years heroic fight with pancreatic
cancer. In this work, we designed a protocol to repeatedly use a classical one-time-pad key to transmit
ciphertext using single photon states. The essential idea was proposed in November 1982, by Charles
H. Bennett, Gilles Brassard, Seth Breidbart, which was rejected by Fifteenth Annual ACM Symposium
on Theory of Computing, and remained unpublished until 2014, when they published the article, Quantum
Cryptography II: How to re-use a one-time pad safely even if P=NP, Natural Computing (2014) 13:453-458,
DOI 10.1007/s11047-014-9453-6. We worked out this idea independently. This work has not been published,
and was in cooperated into quant-ph 706.3791 (Kai Wen, Fu Guo Deng, Gui Lu Long, Secure Reusable Base-String
in Quantum Key Distribution), and quant-ph 0711.1642 (Kai Wen, Fu-Guo Deng, Gui Lu Long, Reusable
Vernam Cipher with Quantum Media).
