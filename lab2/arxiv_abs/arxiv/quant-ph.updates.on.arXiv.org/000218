We introduce a framework unifying the mathematical characterisation of different measures of
general quantum resources and allowing for a systematic way to define a variety of faithful quantifiers
for any given convex quantum resource theory. The approach allows us to describe many commonly used
measures such as matrix norm-based quantifiers, robustness measures, convex roof-based measures,
and witness-based quantifiers together in a common formalism based on the convex geometry of the
underlying sets of resource-free states. We establish easily verifiable criteria for a measure
to possess desirable properties such as faithfulness and strong monotonicity under relevant free
operations, and show that many quantifiers obtained in this framework indeed satisfy them for any
considered quantum resource. We derive various bounds and relations between the measures as well
as their dual forms, generalising and in many cases simplifying results found in the resource theories
of quantum entanglement and coherence. We also prove that the quantification of resources in this
framework simplifies for pure states, allowing us to obtain more easily computable forms of the
considered measures, and show that many of them are in fact equal on pure states. We present an explicit
application of the results to the resource theories of multi-level coherence, entanglement of
Schmidt number k, multipartite entanglement, as well as magic states, providing insight into the
quantification of the four resources and introducing new quantifiers, such as a measure of entanglement
of Schmidt number k which generalises the convex roof-extended negativity, a measure of k-coherence
which generalises the L1 norm of coherence, and a hierarchy of norm-based quantifiers of k-partite
entanglement generalising the greatest cross norm.
