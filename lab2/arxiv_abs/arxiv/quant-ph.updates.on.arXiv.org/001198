Cyclic systems of dichotomous random variables have played a prominent role in contextuality research,
describing such experimental paradigms as the Klyachko-Can-Binicoglu-Shumovky, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bell,
and Legget-Garg ones in physics, as well as conjoint binary choices in human decision making. Here,
we study cyclic systems that are, generally, inconsistently connected (i.e. allow for "disturbance,"
or "signaling"), and we relate them to two measures of the degree of contextuality in contextual
systems, \textnormal{CNT}_{1} and \textnormal{CNT}_{2}. It has been previously shown that only
the latter can be naturally extended into a measure of the degree of noncontextuality in noncontextual
systems, \textnormal{NCNT}_{2}. Both \textnormal{CNT}_{2} and \textnormal{NCNT}_{2} are
defined as the L_{1}-distance between a point representing a cyclic system and the surface of the
polytope representing all possible noncontextual cyclic systems with the same single-variable
marginals. We completely characterize this polytope, as well as the polytope of all possible couplings
for cyclic systems with given single-variable marginals, and we establish that, for contextual
cyclic systems, \textnormal{CNT}_{2} is equal to \textnormal{CNT}_{1}. Both of them are proportional
to the absolute value of the difference between the two sides of a generalized maximally tight Bell
inequality. For noncontextual cyclic systems, the measure \textnormal{NCNT}_{2} is shown to
be proportional to the smaller of the same difference and the L_{1}-distance to the surface of the
box circumscribing the noncontextuality polytope. These simple relations, however, do not generally
hold beyond the class of cyclic systems, and noncontextuality of a system does not follow from noncontextuality
of its cyclic subsystems.
