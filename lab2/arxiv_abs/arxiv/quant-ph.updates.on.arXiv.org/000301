Given a linear map $\Phi : M_n \rightarrow M_m$, its multiplicity maps are defined as the family of
linear maps $\Phi \otimes \text{id}_k : M_n \otimes M_k \rightarrow M_m \otimes M_k$, where $\text{id}_k$
denotes the identity on $M_k$. Let $\|\cdot\|_1$ denote the trace-norm on matrices, as well as the
induced trace-norm on linear maps of matrices, i.e. $\|\Phi\|_1 = \max\{\|\Phi(X)\|_1 : X \in M_n,
\|X\|_1 = 1\}$. A fact of fundamental importance in both operator algebras and quantum information
is that $\|\Phi \otimes \text{id}_k\|_1$ can grow with $k$. In general, the rate of growth is bounded
by $\|\Phi \otimes \text{id}_k\|_1 \leq k \|\Phi\|_1$, and matrix transposition is the canonical
example of a map achieving this bound. We prove that, up to an equivalence, the transpose is the unique
map achieving this bound. The equivalence is given in terms of complete trace-norm isometries,
and the proof relies on a particular characterization of complete trace-norm isometries regarding
preservation of certain multiplication relations. We use this result to characterize the set of
single-shot quantum channel discrimination games satisfying a norm relation that, operationally,
implies that the game can be won with certainty using entanglement, but is hard to win without entanglement.
Specifically, we show that the well-known example of such a game, involving the Werner-Holevo channels,
is essentially the unique game satisfying this norm relation. This constitutes a step towards a
characterization of single-shot quantum channel discrimination games with maximal gap between
optimal performance of entangled and unentangled strategies.
