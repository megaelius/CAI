In a two-player game, two cooperating but non communicating players, Alice and Bob, receive inputs
taken from a probability distribution. Each of them produces an output and they win the game if they
satisfy some predicate on their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega^*(G)$ of a game $G$
is the maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to share an entangled
state prior to receiving their inputs. The $n$-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$ consists of
$n$ instances of $G$ where the players receive all the inputs at the same time and produce all the outputs
at the same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each instance of $G$. In this paper we show that for any game
$G$ such that $\omega^*(G) = 1 - \varepsilon < 1$, $\omega^*(G^n)$ decreases exponentially
in $n$. First, for any game $G$ on the uniform distribution, we show that $\omega^*(G^n) = (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\log(|I||O|)}
- |\log(\varepsilon)|\right)}$, where $|I|$ and $|O|$ are the sizes of the input and output sets.
From this result, we show that for any entangled game $G$, $\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega(\frac{n}{Q\log(|I||O|)}
- \frac{|\log(\varepsilon)|}{Q})}$ where $p$ is the input distribution of $G$ and $Q= \frac{|I|^2
\max_{xy} p_{xy}^2 }{\min_{xy} p_{xy} }$. This implies parallel repetition with exponential
decay as long as $\min_{xy} \{p_{xy}\} \neq 0$ for general games. To prove this parallel repetition,
we introduce the concept of \emph{Superposed Information Cost} for entangled games which is inspired
from the information cost used in communication complexity.
