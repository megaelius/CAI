Subject 1: The constant h is elevated to a dynamical field, coupling to other fields, and itself,
through the Lagrangian density derivative terms. The spatial and temporal dependence of h falls
directly out of the field equations themselves. Additional constants are necessary to set up the
equations, followed by yet more that are generated in the differential equation solutions, and
one may not escape the ultimate need of a true constant of some sort. Three solutions are found, two
are quantizable, and the third is not quantizable. The third corresponds to a zero momentum classical
field that naturally decays spatially to a constant with no ad-hoc terms added to the Lagrangian.
An attempt is made to calibrate the constants in the third solution based on experimental data. The
three fields are referred to as actons. It is tentatively concluded that the acton origin coincides
with a massive body, and can only exist if there is a violation of Local Position Invariance. Subject
2: The Hamiltonian of the Schrodinger equation is replaced by a symmetrizing anti-commutator so
that it remains Hermitian when Planck's constant becomes position dependent. It is found that particles
statistically avoid regions of higher Planck's constant in the absence of an external potential.
Frequency is conserved, and the total frequency equals "kinetic frequency" plus "potential frequency".
No straightforward connection to classical mechanics is found, that is, the Ehrenfest's theorems
are more complicated, and the usual quantities related by them can be complex or imaginary. Energy
is conserved only locally with small gradients in Planck's constant.
