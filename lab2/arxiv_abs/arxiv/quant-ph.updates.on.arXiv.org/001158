Rich quantum effects emerge when several quantum systems are indistinguishable from the point
of view of the bath they interact with. In particular, delocalised excitations corresponding to
coherent superposition of excited states appear and change drastically the dynamics and steady
state of the systems. Such phenomena, present interesting properties for thermodynamics and potentially
other quantum technologies. Indeed, a recent paper [PRA 99, 052105 (2019)] studies these properties
in a pair of indistinguishable two-level systems and points out surprising effects of mitigation
and amplification of the bath's action on the energy and entropy of the pair. Here, we generalise
the study to ensembles of arbitrary number of spins of arbitrary size. We confirm that the previously
uncovered mitigation and amplification effects remain, but also that they become more and more
pronounced with growing number of spin and growing spin size. Moreover, we also investigate the
free energy and the entropy production of the overall dissipation process and find dramatic reductions
of irreversibility. This is a promising aspect since irreversibility is known to limit the performance
of thermal machines. Furthermore, mitigating or amplifying the effects of the baths is highly desirable
in quantum thermodynamics if one wants to optimise the use of the baths to enhance the performance
of thermodynamic tasks. As illustrative application of these effects, we show explicitly the large
power enhancements that can be obtained in cyclic thermal machines. Beyond thermodynamics, the
above findings might lead to interesting applications in state protection, quantum computational
tasks, light harvesting devices, quantum biology, but also for the study of entropy production.
Moreover, an experimental observation [J. M. Raimond, et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 117 (1982)] confirms
that such effects are indeed within reach.
