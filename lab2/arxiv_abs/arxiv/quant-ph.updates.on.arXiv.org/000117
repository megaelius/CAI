In this paper we present a new operational interpretation of relative-entropy between quantum
states in the form of the following protocol. P: Alice gets to know the eigen-decomposition of a quantum
state $\rho$. Bob gets to know the eigen-decomposition of a quantum state $\sigma$. Both Alice and
Bob know $ S(\rho || \sigma) = Tr \rho \log \rho - \rho \log \sigma$, the relative entropy between $\rho$
and $\sigma$ and an error parameter $\epsilon$. Alice and Bob use shared entanglement and after
communication of $O((S(\rho || \sigma) +1)/\epsilon^4)$ bits from Alice to Bob, Bob ends up with
a quantum state $\tilde{\rho}$ such that $F(\rho, \tilde{\rho}) \geq 1 - \epsilon$, where $F(\cdot)$
represents fidelity. This result can be considered as a non-commutative generalization of a result
due to Braverman and Rao [2011] where they considered the special case when $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are
classical probability distributions. We use protocol P to obtain an alternate proof of a direct-sum
result for entanglement assisted quantum one-way communication complexity for all relations,
which was first shown by Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [2005, 2008]. Our second result provides a new
operational meaning to trace distance between quantum states in the form of a protocol which can
be viewed as a quantum analogue of the classical correlated-sampling protocol, which is widely
used, for example by Holenstein [2007] in his proof of a parallel-repetition theorem for two-player
one-round games. Recently Dinur, Steurer and Vidick [2013] have shown another version of a quantum
correlated sampling protocol different from our protocol, and used it in their proof of a parallel-repetition
theorem for two-prover one-round entangled projection games.
