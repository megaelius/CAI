Mechanical systems facilitate the development of a new generation of hybrid quantum technology
comprising electrical, optical, atomic and acoustic degrees of freedom. Entanglement is the essential
resource that defines this new paradigm of quantum enabled devices. Continuous variable (CV) entangled
fields, known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states, are spatially separated two-mode squeezed
states that can be used to implement quantum teleportation and quantum communication. In the optical
domain, EPR states are typically generated using nondegenerate optical amplifiers and at microwave
frequencies Josephson circuits can serve as a nonlinear medium. It is an outstanding goal to deterministically
generate and distribute entangled states with a mechanical oscillator. Here we observe stationary
emission of path-entangled microwave radiation from a parametrically driven 30 micrometer long
silicon nanostring oscillator, squeezing the joint field operators of two thermal modes by 3.40(37)
dB below the vacuum level. This mechanical system correlates up to 50 photons/s/Hz giving rise to
a quantum discord that is robust with respect to microwave noise. Such generalized quantum correlations
of separable states are important for quantum enhanced detection and provide direct evidence for
the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator without directly measuring its state. This
noninvasive measurement scheme allows to infer information about otherwise inaccessible objects
with potential implications in sensing, open system dynamics and fundamental tests of quantum
gravity. In the near future, similar on-chip devices can be used to entangle subsystems on vastly
different energy scales such as microwave and optical photons.
