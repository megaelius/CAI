The stochastic theory of non-relativistic quantum mechanics presented here relies heavily upon
the theory of stochastic processes, with its definitions, theorems and specific vocabulary as
well. Its main hypothesis states indeed that the classical trajectories of the particles are identical
to the sample functions of a diffusion Markov process, whose conditional probability density is
proposed as a substitute for the wave function. The Schroedinger equation and the so-called Nelson
equations are used to determine the diffusion tensor and the drift vectors characteristic of such
a process. It is then possible to write down the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations that are
used to determine the conditional probability density, as well as the Fokker-Planck equation that
is used to determine the normal probability density. This method is applied to several simple cases
and the results obtained are compared with those of the orthodox theory. Among the most important
differences let us mention that any system evolving freely from any original state returns spontaneously
to its ground state, that the definitions of the particles velocities and momenta are impossible
because the sample functions of a diffusion Markov process nowhere possess a derivative with respect
to time and that the so-called collapse of the wave function is a mere mirage explained by the updating
choice between new and older initial conditions in the resolution of partial differential equations.
We finally attempt to extend the proposed theory to the domain of the relativistic quantum mechanics.
It is promising but is clearly unfinished because it has not been possible up to now to solve the Nelson
and Kolmogorov equations, except in the very simple case of a free particle.
