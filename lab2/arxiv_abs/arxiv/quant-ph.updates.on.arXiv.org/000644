Transport phenomena are ubiquitous throughout the science, engineering and technology disciplines
as it concerns energy, mass, charge and information exchange between systems. In particular, energy
transport in the nanoscale regime has attracted significant attention within the physical science
community due to its potential to explain complex phenomena like the electronic energy transfer
in molecular crystals or the Fenna-Matthews-Olson / light harvesting complexes in photosynthetic
bacteria with long time coherences. Energy transport in these systems is highly affected by environmental
noise but surprisingly not always in a detrimental way. It was recently found that situations exist
where noise actually enhances the transport phenomena. Such noise can take many forms, but can be
characterised in three basic behaviours: quantum, coloured or nonlocal. All have been shown potential
to offer an energy transport enhancement. The focus of this work is on quantum transport caused by
stochastic environment with spatio-temporal correlation. We consider a multi-site nearest neighbour
interaction model with pure dephasing environmental noise with coloured and nonlocal character
and show how an accelerated rate for the energy transfer results especially under anti-correlation.
Negative spatial correlations provide another control parameter to help one establish the most
efficient transfer of energy and may provide new insights into the working of exciton transport
in photosynthetic complexes. Further the usage of spatio-temporal correlated noise may be a beneficial
resource for efficient transport in large scale quantum networks.
