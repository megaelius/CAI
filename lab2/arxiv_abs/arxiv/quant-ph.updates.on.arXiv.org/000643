Quantum discord, a kind of quantum correlation based on entropic measures, is defined as the difference
between quantum mutual information and classical correlation in a bipartite system. Procedures
are available for analytical calculation of discord when one of the parties is a qubit with dimension
two and measurements made on it to get that one-way discord. We extend now to systems when both parties
are of larger dimension, of interest to qudit-quDit with d, D > 2 or spin chains of spins > 1/2. While
recognizing that no universal scheme is feasible, applicable to all density matrices, nevertheless
a procedure similar to that for d=2 that works for many mixed-state density matrices remains of interest
as shown by recent such applications. We focus on this method that uses unitary operations to describe
measurements, reducing them to a compact form so as to minimize the number of variables needed for
extremizing the classical correlation, often the most difficult part of the discord calculation.
Results are boiled down to a simple recipe for that extremization; for some classes of density matrices,
the procedure even gives trivially the final value of the classical correlation without that extremization.
A qutrit-qutrit (d=D=3) system is discussed in detail with specific applications to density matrices
for whom other calculations involved difficult numerics. Special attention is given to the so-called
X-states and Werner and isotropic states when the calculations become particularly simple. An
appendix discusses an independent but related question of the systematics of X-states of arbitrary
dimension. It forms a second, separate, part of this paper, extending our previous group-theoretic
considerations of systematics for qubits now to higher d.
