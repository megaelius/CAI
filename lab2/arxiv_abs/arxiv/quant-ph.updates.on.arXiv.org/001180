Far-from-equilibrium situations are ubiquitous in nature. They are responsible for a wealth of
phenomena, which are not simple extensions of near-equilibrium properties, ranging from fluid
flows turning turbulent to the highly organized forms of life. On the fundamental level, quantum
fluctuations or entanglement lead to novel forms of complex dynamical behaviour in many-body systems
for which a description as emergent phenomena can be found within the framework of quantum field
theory. A central quantity in these efforts, containing all information about the measurable physical
properties, is the quantum effective action. Though the problem of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics
can be exactly formulated in terms of the quantum effective action, the solution is in general beyond
capabilities of classical computers. In this work, we present a strategy to determine the non-equilibrium
quantum effective action using analog quantum simulators, and demonstrate our method experimentally
with a quasi one-dimensional spinor Bose gas out of equilibrium. Building on spatially resolved
snapshots of the spin degree of freedom, we infer the quantum effective action up to fourth order
in an expansion in one-particle irreducible correlation functions at equal times. We uncover a
strong suppression of the irreducible four-vertex emerging at low momenta, which solves the problem
of dynamics in the highly occupied regime far from equilibrium where perturbative descriptions
fail. Similar behaviour in this non-pertubative regime has been proposed in the context of early-universe
cosmology. Our work constitutes a new realm of large-scale analog quantum computing, where the
high level of control of synthetic quantum systems provides the means for the solution of long-standing
theoretical problems in high-energy and condensed matter physics with an experimental approach.
