Despite being known for his pioneering work on chaotic unpredictability, the key discovery at the
core of meteorologist Ed Lorenz's work is the link between space-time calculus and state-space
fractal geometry. Indeed, properties of Lorenz's fractal invariant set relate space-time calculus
to deep areas of mathematics such as G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem. These properties, combined
with some recent developments in theoretical and observational cosmology, motivate what is referred
to as the `cosmological invariant set postulate': that the universe $U$ can be considered a deterministic
dynamical system evolving on a causal measure-zero fractal invariant set $I_U$ in its state space.
Symbolic representations of $I_U$ are constructed explicitly based on permutation representations
of quaternions. The resulting `invariant set theory' provides some new perspectives on determinism
and causality in fundamental physics. For example, whilst the cosmological invariant set appears
to have a rich enough structure to allow a description of quantum probability, its measure-zero
character ensures it is sparse enough to prevent invariant set theory being constrained by the Bell
inequality (consistent with a partial violation of the so-called measurement independence postulate).
The primacy of geometry as embodied in the proposed theory extends the principles underpinning
general relativity. As a result, the physical basis for contemporary programmes which apply standard
field quantisation to some putative gravitational lagrangian is questioned. Consistent with
Penrose's suggestion of a deterministic but non-computable theory of fundamental physics, a `gravitational
theory of the quantum' is proposed based on the geometry of $I_U$, with potential observational
consequences for the dark universe.
