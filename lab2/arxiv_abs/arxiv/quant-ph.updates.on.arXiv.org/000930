The accelerated progress in manufacturing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing
hardware has opened the possibility of exploring its application in transforming approaches to
solving computationally challenging problems. The important limitations common among all NISQ
computing technologies are the absence of error correction and the short coherence time, which
limit the computational power of these systems. Shortening the required time of a single run of a
quantum algorithm is essential for reducing environment-induced errors and for the efficiency
of the computation. We have investigated the ability of a variational version of adiabatic quantum
computation (AQC) to generate an accurate state more efficiently compared to existing adiabatic
methods. The standard AQC method uses a time-dependent Hamiltonian, connecting the initial Hamiltonian
with the final Hamiltonian. In the current approach, a navigator Hamiltonian is introduced which
has a non-zero amplitude only in the middle of the annealing process. Both the initial and navigator
Hamiltonians are determined using variational methods. A hermitian cluster operator, inspired
by coupled-cluster theory and truncated to single and double excitations/de-excitations, is
used as a navigator Hamiltonian. A comparative study of our variational algorithm (VanQver) with
that of standard AQC, starting with a Hartree--Fock Hamiltonian, is presented. The results indicate
that the introduction of the navigator Hamiltonian significantly improves the annealing time
required to achieve chemical accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude. The efficiency of the
method is demonstrated in the ground-state energy estimation of molecular systems, namely, H$_2$,
P4, and LiH.
