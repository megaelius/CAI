The closed time path formalism is applied, in the framework of open quantum systems, to study the
time evolution of the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a scalar field in the presence
of real materials. We analyze quantum fluctuations in a fully non-equilibrium scenario, when the
scalar field is interacting with the polarization degrees of freedom of matter, described as quantum
Brownian particles. A generalized analysis was done for two types of couplings between the field
and the material. On the one hand, we considered a bilinear coupling, and on the other hand, a (more
realistic) current-type coupling as in the case of the electromagnetic field interacting with
matter. We considered the high temperature limit for the field, keeping arbitrary temperatures
for each part of the volume elements of the material. We obtained a closed form for the Hadamard propagator,
which let us study the dynamical evolution of the expectations values of the energy-momentum tensor
components from the initial time. We showed that two contributions always take place in the transient
evolution: one of these is associated to the material and the other one is only associated to the field.
Transient features were studied and the long-time limit was derived in several cases. We proved
that in the steady situation of a field in n + 1 dimensions, the material always contribute unless
is non-dissipative. Conversely, the proper field contribution vanishes unless the material is
non-dissipative or, moreover, at least for the 1 + 1 case, if there are regions without material.
We conclude that any steady quantization scheme in 1 + 1 dimensions must consider both contributions
and we argue why these results are physically expected from a dynamical point of view, and also could
be valid for higher dimensions based on the expected continuity between the non-dissipative and
real material cases.
