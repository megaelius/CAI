Decoupling theorems are an important tool in quantum information theory where they are used as building
blocks in a host of information transmission protocols. A decoupling theorem takes a bipartite
quantum state shared between a system and a reference, applies some local operation on the system,
and under suitable constraints, proves that the resulting state is close to a product state between
the output system and the untouched reference. The theorem is said to be non-catalytic if it does
not require an additional input of a quantum state, in tensor with the given input state, for the decoupling.
Dupuis proved an important non-catalytic decoupling theorem where the operation on the system
was a Haar random unitary followed by a fixed superoperator, unifying many decoupling results proved
earlier. He also showed a concentration result for his decoupling theorem. In this work we give a
new concentration result for non-catalytic decoupling by showing that, for suitably large t, a
unitary chosen uniformly at random from an approximate t-design gives rise to a state close to a product
state with probability $\exp\sim 1$. Our concentration, though exponential, is less than that
of Dupuis but for many important applications it uses less random bits than Dupuis. In particular,
we prove that approximate $|A_1|$-designs decouple a quantum system in the Fully Quantum Slepian
Wolf (FQSW) theorem wherein a fixed superoperator traces out the subsystem $A_2$ from a system $A_1\otimes
A_2$. This leads to a saving in the number of random bits to $O(|A_1| \log (|A_1| |A_2|))$ from $\Omega(|A_1|^2|A_2|^2\log
(|A_1||A_2|))$ required by Haar random unitaries. Moreover, if $|A_1|=poly\log(|A_2|)$, efficient
constructions of approximate $|A_1|$-designs exist. This further implies that approximate unitary
$|A_1|$-designs achieve relative thermalisation in quantum thermodynamics with $exp$ high probability.
