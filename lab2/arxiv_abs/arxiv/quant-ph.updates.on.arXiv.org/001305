The magnetic dipole field geometry of subatomic elementary particles like the electron differs
from the classical macroscopic field imprint of a bar magnet. It resembles more like an eight figure
or else joint double quantum-dots instead of the classical, spherical more uniform field of a bar
magnet. This actual subatomic quantum magnetic field of an electron at rest, is called Quantum Magnet
or else a Magneton. Normally, a macroscale bar magnet should behave like a relative giant Quantum
Magnet with identical magnetic dipole field imprint since all of its individual magnetons collectively
inside the material, dipole moments are uniformly aligned forming the total net field of the magnet.
However due to Quantum Decoherence (QDE) phenomenon at the macroscale and macroscopic magnetic
field imaging sensors limitations which cannot pickup these rapid quantum magnetization fluctuations,
this field is masked and not visible at the macroscale. By using the relative inexpensive submicron
resolution Ferrolens quantum magnetic optical sensor and method, we can actually make this net
magneton field visible on macroscale magnets. We call this net total field herein, Quantum Field
of Magnet (QFM) differentiating it therefore from the field of the single subatomic magneton thus
quantum magnet. Additionally, the unique potential of the Ferrolens device to display also the
magnetic flux lines of this macroscopically projected giant Magenton gives us the unique opportunity
to study the individual magnetic flux lines geometrical pattern that of a single subatomic magneton.
We describe this particular magnetic flux of the magneton observed, quantum magnetic flux. Therefore
a novel observation has been made that the QFM of the Magnet-Magneton consists of a dipole vortex
shaped magnetic flux geometrical pattern responsible for creating the classical macroscopic
N-S field of the magnet.
