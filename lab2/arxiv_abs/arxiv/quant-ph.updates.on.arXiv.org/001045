Quantum non-locality tests have been of interest since the original EPR paper. The present paper
discusses whether the CGLMP (Bell) inequalities obtained by Collins et al are possible tests for
showing that quantum theory is not underpinned by local hidden variable theory (LHVT). It is found
by applying Fine's theorem that the CGLMP approach involves a LHVT for the probabilities associated
with measurements on two observables (each from one of the two sub-subsystems), even though the
underlying probabilities for measurements of all four observables involve a hidden variable theory
which is not required to be local. Although the CGLMP inequalities involve probabilities for measurements
of one observable per sub-system and are compatible with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
there is no unambiguous quantum measurement process linked to the probabilities in the CGLMP inequalities.
Quantum measurements corresponding to the different classical measurements that give the same
CGLMP probability are found to yield different CGLMP probabilities. However, violation of a CGLMP
inequality based on any one of the possible quantum measurement sequences is sufficient to show
that the Collins et al LHVT does not predict the same results as quantum theory. This is found to occur
for a state considered in their paper - though for observables whose physical interpretation is
unclear. In spite of the problems of comparing the HVT inequalities with quantum expressions, it
is concluded that the CGLMP inequalities are indeed suitable for ruling out local hidden variable
theories. The state involved could apply to a macroscopic system, so the CGLMP Bell inequalities
are important for finding cases of macroscopic violations of Bell locality. Possible experiments
in double-well Bose condensates involving atoms with two hyperfine components are discussed.
