The diffculties of relativistic particle theories formulated my means of canonical quantization,
such as Klein-Gordon and Dirac theories, ultimately led theoretical physicists to turn on quantum
field theory to model elementary particle physics. The aim of the present work is to pursue a method
alternative to canonical quantization that avoids these dfficulties. In order to guarantee this
result, the present approach is constrained to be developed deductively from physical principles.
The physical principles assumed for a free particle consist of the symmetry properties of the particle
with respect to the Poincar\'e group and of the transformation properties of the position observable,
expressed by means of a suitably conceived notion of quantum transformation. In so doing, the effectiveness
of group theoretical methods is exploited. Our work has pointed out the necessity of new classes
of irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group the theory can be based on. For spin 0 particle,
four inequivalent theories are completely determined, that differ from Klein-Gordon theory for
the physical interpretation but also for the mathematical structures. In particular, two of these
theories requires irreducible representations in the new classes. The present lack of the explicit
transformation properties of position with respect to boosts forbids the complete determination
of non zero spin particle theories. A particular form of these transformation properties was in
past adopted by Jordan and Mukunda. We check its consistency within the present approach; it is found
that for spin 1/2 particles there is only one consistent theory; it is unitarily related to Dirac
theory, but, once again, it requires the new classes of irreducible representations.
