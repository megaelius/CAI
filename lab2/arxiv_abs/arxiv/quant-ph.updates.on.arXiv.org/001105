The problem of causal inference is to determine if a given probability distribution on observed
variables is compatible with some causal structure. The difficult case is when the causal structure
includes latent variables. We here introduce the $\textit{inflation technique}$ for tackling
this problem. An inflation of a causal structure is a new causal structure that can contain multiple
copies of each of the original variables, but where the ancestry of each copy mirrors that of the original.
To every distribution of the observed variables that is compatible with the original causal structure,
we assign a family of marginal distributions on certain subsets of the copies that are compatible
with the inflated causal structure. It follows that compatibility constraints for the inflation
can be translated into compatibility constraints for the original causal structure. Even if the
constraints at the level of inflation are weak, such as observable statistical independences implied
by disjoint causal ancestry, the translated constraints can be strong. We apply this method to derive
new inequalities whose violation by a distribution witnesses that distribution's incompatibility
with the causal structure (of which Bell inequalities and Pearl's instrumental inequality are
prominent examples). We describe an algorithm for deriving all such inequalities for the original
causal structure that follow from ancestral independences in the inflation. For three observed
binary variables with pairwise common causes, it yields inequalities that are stronger in at least
some aspects than those obtainable by existing methods. We also describe an algorithm that derives
a weaker set of inequalities but is more efficient. Finally, we discuss which inflations are such
that the inequalities one obtains from them remain valid even for quantum (and post-quantum) generalizations
of the notion of a causal model.
