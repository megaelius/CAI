We study locality preserving automorphisms of operator algebras on $D$-dimensional uniform lattices
of prime $p$-dimensional qudits (QCA), specializing in those that are translation invariant (TI)
and map every prime $p$-dimensional Pauli matrix to a tensor product of Pauli matrices (Clifford).
We associate antihermitian forms of unit determinant over Laurent polynomial rings to TI Clifford
QCA with lattice boundaries, and prove that the form determines the QCA up to Clifford circuits and
shifts (trivial). It follows that every 2D TI Clifford QCA is trivial since the antihermitian form
in this case is always trivial. Further, we prove that for any $D$ the fourth power of any TI Clifford
QCA is trivial. We present explicit examples of nontrivial TI Clifford QCA for $D=3$ and any odd prime
$p$, and show that the Witt group of the finite field $\mathbb F_p$ is a subgroup of the group $\mathfrak
C(D = 3, p)$ of all TI Clifford QCA modulo trivial ones. That is, $\mathfrak C(D = 3, p \equiv 1 \mod 4)
\supseteq \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathfrak C(D = 3, p \equiv 3 \mod 4) \supseteq \mathbb
Z_4$. The examples are found by disentangling the ground state of a commuting Pauli Hamiltonian
which is constructed by coupling layers of prime dimensional toric codes such that an exposed surface
has an anomalous topological order that is not realizable by commuting Pauli Hamiltonians strictly
in two dimensions. In an appendix independent of the main body of the paper, we revisit a recent theorem
of Freedman and Hastings that any two-dimensional QCA, which is not necessarily Clifford or translation
invariant, is a constant depth quantum circuit followed by a shift. We give a more direct proof of
the theorem without using any ancillas.
