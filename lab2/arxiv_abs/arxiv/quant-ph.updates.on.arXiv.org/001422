Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has revealed peculiar properties of mobile
dopants in correlated anti-ferromagnets (AFMs). But describing them theoretically, even in simplified
toy models, remains a challenge. Here we study ARPES spectra of a single mobile hole in the $t-J$ model.
Recent progress in the microscopic description of mobile dopants allows us to use a geometric decoupling
of spin and charge fluctuations at strong couplings, from which we conjecture a one-to-one relation
of the one-dopant spectral function and the spectrum of a constituting spinon in the \emph{undoped}
parent AFM. We thoroughly test this hypothesis for a single hole doped into a 2D Heisenberg AFM by
comparing our semi-analytical predictions to previous quantum Monte Carlo results and our large-scale
time-dependent matrix product state (td-MPS) calculations of the spectral function. Our conclusion
is supported by a microscopic trial wavefuntion describing spinon-chargon bound states, which
captures the momentum and $t/J$ dependence of the quasiparticle residue. Our conjecture suggests
that ARPES measurements in the pseudogap phase of cuprates can directly reveal the Dirac-fermion
nature of the constituting spinons. Specifically, we demonstrate that our trial wavefunction
provides a microscopic explanation for the sudden drop of spectral weight around the nodal point
associated with the formation of Fermi arcs, assuming that additional frustration suppresses
long-range AFM ordering. We benchmark our results by studying the cross-over from two to one dimension,
where spinons and chargons are confined and deconfined respectively.
