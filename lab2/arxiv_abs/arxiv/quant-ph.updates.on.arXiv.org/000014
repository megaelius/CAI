We extend the concepts of the Autler-Townes doublet and triplet spectroscopy to quartuplet, quintuplet
and suggest linkages in sodium atom in which to display these spectra. We explore the involved fundamental
processes of quantum interference of the corresponding spectroscopy by examining the Laplace
transform of the corresponding state-vector subjected to steady coherent illumination in the
rotating wave approximation and Weisskopf-Wigner treatment of spontaneous emission as a simplest
probability loss. In the quartuplet, four fields interact appropriately and resonantly with the
five-level atom. The spectral profile of the single decaying level, upon interaction with three
other levels, splits into four destructively interfering dressed states generating three dark
lines in the spectrum. These dark lines divide the spectrum into four spectral components (bright
lines) whose widths are effectively controlled by the relative strength of the laser fields and
the relative width of the single decaying level. We also extend the idea to the higher-ordered multiplet
spectroscopy by increasing the number of energy levels of the atomic system, the number of laser
fields to couple with the required states. The apparent disadvantage of these schemes is the successive
increase in the number of laser fields required for the strongly interactive atomic states in the
complex atomic systems. However, these complexities are naturally inherited and are the beauties
of these atomic systems. They provide the foundations for the basic mechanisms of the quantum interference
involved in the higher-ordered multiplet spectroscopy.
