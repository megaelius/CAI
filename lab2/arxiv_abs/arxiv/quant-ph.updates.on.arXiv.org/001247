That quantum correlations can be generated over time between the spin and the position of a quantum
walker is indisputable. The creation of bipartite entanglement has also been reported for two-walker
systems. In this scenario, however, since the global state lies in a fourpartite Hilbert space,
the question arises as to whether genuine multipartite entanglement may develop in time. Also,
since the spatial degrees of freedom can be viewed as a noisy channel for the two-spin part, one may
wonder how other nonclassical aspects, such as Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering,
quantum discord, and symmetrical quantum discord, evolve in time during the walk. The lack of analytical
and numerical evidences which would allow one to address these questions is possibly due to the usual
computational difficulties associated with the recursive nature of quantum walks. Here, we work
around this issue by introducing a simplified Gaussian model which proves to be very accurate within
a given domain and powerful for analytical studies. Then, for an instance involving two noninteracting
quantum walkers, whose spins start in the singlet state, we quantify the aforementioned nonclassical
features as a function of time, and evaluate violations of both realism and related aspects of locality.
In addition, we analyze situations in which the initial two-spin state is affected by white noise.
The typical scenario found is such that while genuine fourpartite entanglement increases over
time, all the investigated nonclassical features vanish (suddenly or asymptotically) except
realism-based nonlocality. Moreover, realism is prevented for all finite times. Our findings
open perspectives for the understanding of the dynamics of quantum resources in quantum walks.
