Here we present a flexible tensor network based simulator for quantum circuits on different topologies,
including the Google Bristlecone QPU. Our simulator can compute both exact amplitudes, a task essential
for the verification of the quantum hardware, as well as low-fidelity amplitudes to mimic Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While our simulator can be used to compute amplitudes
of arbitrary quantum circuits, we focus on random quantum circuits (RQCs) [Boixo et al., Nature
Physics 14] in the range of sizes expected for supremacy experiments. Our simulator enables the
simulation of sampling on quantum circuits that were out of reach for previous approaches. For instance,
our simulator is able to output single amplitudes with depth 1+32+1 for the full Bristlecone QPU
in less than $(f \cdot 4200)$ hours on a single core, where $0<f\leq1$ is the target fidelity, on $2\times20$-core
Intel Xeon Gold 6148 processors (Skylake). We also estimate that computing $10^6$ amplitudes (with
fidelity 0.50\%) needed to sample from the full Bristlecone QPU with depth (1+32+1) would require
about 3.5 days using the NASA Pleiades and Electra supercomputers combined. In addition, we discuss
the hardness of the classical simulation of RQCs, as well as give evidence for the higher complexity
in the simulation of Bristlecone topology as compared to other two-dimensional grids with the same
number of qubits. Our analysis is supported by extensive simulations on NASA HPC clusters Pleiades
and Electra. For the most computationally demanding simulation we had, namely the simulation of
a $60$-qubit sub-lattice of Bristlecone, the two HPC clusters combined reached a peak of 20 PFLOPS
(single precision), that is $64\%$ of their maximum achievable performance. To date, this numerical
computation is the largest in terms of sustained PFLOPS and number of nodes utilized ever run on NASA
HPC clusters.
