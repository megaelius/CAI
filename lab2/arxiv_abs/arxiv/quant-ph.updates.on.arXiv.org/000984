Machine learning can help us in solving problems in the context big data analysis and classification,
as well as in playing complex games such as Go. But can it also be used to find novel protocols and algorithms
for applications such as large-scale quantum communication? Here we show that machine learning
can be used to identify central quantum protocols, including teleportation, entanglement purification
and the quantum repeater. These schemes are of importance in long-distance quantum communication,
and their discovery has shaped the field of quantum information processing. However, the usefulness
of learning agents goes beyond the mere re-production of known protocols; the same approach allows
one to find improved solutions to long-distance communication problems, in particular when dealing
with asymmetric situations where channel noise and segment distance are non-uniform. Our findings
are based on the use of projective simulation, a model of a learning agent that combines reinforcement
learning and decision making in a physically motivated framework. The learning agent is provided
with a universal gate set, and the desired task is specified via a reward scheme. From a technical
perspective, the learning agent has to deal with stochastic environments and reactions. We utilize
an idea reminiscent of hierarchical skill acquisition, where solutions to sub-problems are learned
and re-used in the overall scheme. This is of particular importance in the development of long-distance
communication schemes, and opens the way for using machine learning in the design and implementation
of quantum networks.
