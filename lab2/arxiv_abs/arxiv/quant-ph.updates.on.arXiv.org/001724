Every clock is a physical system and thereby ultimately quantum. A naturally arising question is
how to describe time evolution relative to quantum clocks and, specifically, how the dynamics relative
to different quantum clocks are related. This is a pressing issue in view of the multiple choice problem
of time in quantum gravity, which posits that there is no distinguished choice of internal clock
in generic general relativistic systems and that different choices lead to inequivalent quantum
theories. Exploiting a recent approach to switching quantum reference systems (arXiv:1809.00556,
arXiv:1809:05093), we exhibit a systematic method for switching between different clock choices
in the quantum theory. We illustrate it by means of the parametrized particle, which, like gravity,
features a Hamiltonian constraint. We explicitly switch between the quantum evolution relative
to the non-relativistic time variable and that relative to the particle's position, which requires
carefully regularizing the zero-modes in the so-called time-of-arrival observable. While this
toy model is simple, our approach is general and directly amenable to quantum cosmology. It proceeds
by systematically linking the reduced quantum theories relative to different clock choices via
the clock-choice-neutral Dirac quantized theory, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold.
This method suggests a new perspective on the multiple choice problem, indicating that it is rather
a multiple choice feature of a complete relational quantum theory, taken as the conjunction of Dirac
quantized and quantum deparametrized theories. Precisely this conjunction permits one to consistently
switch between different temporal reference systems which is a prerequisite for a quantum notion
of general covariance. Finally, we show that quantum uncertainties lead to discontinuity in the
relational dynamics when switching clocks.
