We revisit entropic formulations of the uncertainty principle for an arbitrary pair of positive
operator-valued measures (POVM) $A$ and $B$, acting on finite dimensional Hilbert space. Salicr\'u
generalized $(h,\phi)$-entropies, including R\'enyi and Tsallis ones among others, are used
as uncertainty measures associated with the distribution probabilities corresponding to the
outcomes of the observables. We obtain a nontrivial lower bound for the sum of generalized entropies
for any pair of entropic functionals, which is valid for both pure and mixed states. The bound depends
on the overlap triplet $(c_A,c_B,c_{A,B})$ with $c_A$ (resp. $c_B$) being the overlap between
the elements of the POVM $A$ (resp. $B$) and $c_{A,B}$ the overlap between the pair of POVM. Our approach
is inspired by that of de Vicente and S\'anchez-Ruiz [Phys.\ Rev.\ A \textbf{77}, 042110 (2008)]
and consists in a minimization of the entropy sum subject to the Landau-Pollak inequality that links
the maximum probabilities of both observables. We solve the constrained optimization problem
in a geometrical way and furthermore, when dealing with R\'enyi or Tsallis entropic formulations
of the uncertainty principle, we overcome the H\"older conjugacy constraint imposed on the entropic
indices by the Riesz-Thorin theorem. In the case of nondegenerate observables, we show that for
given $c_{A,B} > \frac{1}{\sqrt2}$, the bound obtained is optimal; and that, for R\'enyi entropies,
our bound improves Deutsch one, but Maassen-Uffink bound prevails when $c_{A,B} \leq\frac12$.
Finally, we illustrate by comparing our bound with known previous results in particular cases of
R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies.
