One of the fundamental features of quantum mechanics is the superposition principle, a manifestation
of which is embodied in quantum coherence. Coherence of a quantum state is invariably defined with
respect to a preferred set of pointer states, and there exist quantum coherence measures with respect
to deterministically as well as probabilistically distinguishable sets of quantum state vectors.
Here we study the resource theory of quantum coherence with respect to an arbitrary set of quantum
state vectors, that may not even be probabilistically distinguishable. Geometrically, a probabilistically
indistinguishable set of quantum state vectors forms a linearly dependent set. We find the free
states of the resource theory, and analyze the corresponding free operations, obtaining a necessary
condition for an arbitrary quantum operation to be free. We identify a class of measures of the quantum
coherence, and in particular establish a monotonicity property of the measures. We find a connection
of an arbitrary set of quantum state vectors with positive operator valued measurements with respect
to the resource theory being considered, which paves the way for an alternate definition of the free
states. We notice that the resource theory of magic can be looked upon as a resource theory of quantum
coherence with respect to a set of quantum state vectors that are probabilistically indistinguishable.
We subsequently examine the wave-particle duality in a double-slit set-up in which superposition
of probabilistically indistinguishable quantum state vectors is possible. Specifically, we
report a complementary relation between quantum coherence and path distinguishability in such
a set-up.
