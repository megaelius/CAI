We show that the dynamics of any open quantum system that is initially correlated with its environment
can be described by a set of $d^2$ (or less) completely positive maps, where $d$ is the dimension of
the system. Only one such map is required for the special case of no initial correlations. The same
maps describe the dynamics of any system-environment state obtained from the initial state by a
local operation on the system (and are related to the set of states to which the environment may be
steered via such local operations). The reduction of the system dynamics to a set of completely positive
maps allows known numerical and analytic tools for uncorrelated initial states to be applied to
the general case of initially correlated states, and provides a natural approach to quantum Markovianity
for this case. We show that this set of completely positive maps can be experimentally characterised
using only local operations on the system, via a generalisation of noise spectroscopy protocols.
As applications, we first consider the problem of retrodicting the dynamics of an open quantum system
which is in an arbitrary state when it becomes accessible to the experimenter, and explore the conditions
under which retrodiction is possible. Further, we introduce a related one-sided or limited-access
tomography protocol for determining an arbitrary bipartite state, evolving under a sufficiently
rich Hamiltonian, via local operations and measurements on just one component. We simulate this
protocol for a physical model of particular relevance to nitrogen-vacancy centres, and in particular
show how to reconstruct the density matrix of a set of three qubits, interacting via dipolar coupling
and in the presence of local magnetic fields, by measuring and controlling only one of them.
