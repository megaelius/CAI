We present a quantum scheme for signing contracts between two clients (Alice and Bob) using entangled
states and the services of a third trusted party (Trent). The trusted party is only contacted for
the initialization of the protocol, and possibly at the end, to verify clients' honesty and deliver
signed certificates. The protocol is {\em fair}, i.e., the probability that a client, say Bob, can
obtain a signed copy of the contract, while Alice cannot, can be made arbitrarily small, and scales
as $N^{-1/2}$, where $4N$ is the total number of rounds (communications between the two clients)
of the protocol. Thus, the protocol is {\em optimistic}, as the cheating is not successful, and the
clients rarely have to contact Trent to confirm their honesty by delivering the actual signed certificates
of the contract. Unlike the previous protocol \cite{paun:2011}, in the present proposal only one
client can obtain the signed contract, without the need for the other client's presence. When first
contacting Trent, the clients do not have to agree upon a definitive contract. Moreover, even upon
terminating the protocol, the clients do not reveal the actual contract to Trent. Being based on
the laws of physics, rather than on mathematical conjectures and the exchange of huge number of signed
authenticated messages, the protocol is {\em abuse-free}, as Alice and Bob cannot prove they are
involved in the contract signing process. Finally, we present a version of the protocol that does
not rely on stable quantum memories, making it possible to be realized with the current technology
used in the standard quantum key distribution implementations.
