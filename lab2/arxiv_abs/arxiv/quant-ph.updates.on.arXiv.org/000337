We study the problem of transforming a tripartite pure state to a bipartite one using stochastic
local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). It is known that the tripartite-to-bipartite
SLOCC convertibility is characterized by the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state,
i.e. the largest Schmidt rank over those bipartite states lying in the support of the reduced density
operator. In this paper, we further study this problem and exhibit novel results in both multi-copy
and asymptotic settings. In the multi-copy regime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly
super-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of two tripartite pure
states can be strictly larger than the product of their maximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full
characterization of those tripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative
when taking tensor product with itself. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on determining the tripartite-to-bipartite
SLOCC entanglement transformation rate, which turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic
maximal Schmidt rank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal Schmidt
rank. Despite the difficulty caused by the super-multiplicative property, we provide explicit
formulas for evaluating the asymptotic maximal Schmidt ranks of two important families of tripartite
pure states, by resorting to certain results of the structure of matrix spaces, including the study
of matrix semi-invariants. These formulas give a sufficient and necessary condition to determine
whether a given tripartite pure state can be transformed to the bipartite maximally entangled state
under SLOCC, in the asymptotic setting. Applying the recent progress on the non-commutative rank
problem, we can verify this condition in deterministic polynomial time.
