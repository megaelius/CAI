An often used model for quantum theory is to associate to every physical system a C*-algebra. From
a physical point of view it is unclear why operator algebras would form a good description of nature.
In this paper, we retrieve the category of finite-dimensional C*-algebras using concepts from
effectus theory, a categorical logical framework generalizing classical and quantum logic. As
these concepts have a physical interpretation, this motivates the usage of operator algebras as
a model for quantum theory. In contrast to other reconstructions of quantum theory, we do not start
with the framework of generalised probabilistic theories and instead use effect theories where
no convex structure and no tensor product needs to be present. The lack of this structure in effectus
theory has led to a different notion of pure maps. A map in an effectus is pure when it is a composition
of a compression and a filter. These maps satisfy particular universal properties and respectively
correspond to 'forgetting' and measuring the validity of an effect. We define a pure effect theory
(PET) to be an effect theory where the pure maps form a dagger-category and filters and compressions
are adjoint. We characterise the category of Euclidean Jordan algebras as the most general convex,
finite-dimensional PET. If we in addition assume monoidal structure, then any such PET must embed
into either the category of real or complex C*-algebras, which completes our reconstruction. As
a PET must be quantum theory in the probabilistic convex setting, a PET without those properties
can be viewed as a new type of generalisation of quantum theory.
