We introduce a quantum neural network, QNN, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum,
and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent
unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single
Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural
network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical
data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational
basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries
that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions
the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted
by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled
images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show
through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly
distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of
computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation
that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state.
By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation
of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors
in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where
its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.
