High-fidelity entangling quantum gates based on Rydberg interactions are required for scalable
quantum computing with neutral atoms. Their realization, however, meets a major stumbling block
-- the motion-induced dephasing of the transition between the ground and Rydberg states. By using
quantum interference between different detuned Rabi oscillations, we propose a practical scheme
to realize a class of accurate entangling Rydberg quantum gates subject to a minimal dephasing error.
We show two types of such gates, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$, in the form of $\text{diag}\{1, e^{i\alpha},
e^{i\gamma}, e^{i\beta}\}$, where $\alpha, \gamma$, and $\beta$ are determined by the parameters
of lasers and the Rydberg blockade $V$. $U_{1}$ is realized by sending to the two qubits a {\it single}
off-resonant laser pulse, while $U_{2}$ is realized by individually applying one pulse of detuned
laser to each qubit. One can construct the controlled-z~(C$_{\text{Z}}$) gate from several $U_{1}$
when assisted by single-qubit rotations and phase gates, or from two $U_{2}$ and two phase gates.
Our method has several advantages. First, the gate fidelity is limited only by a rotation error below
$10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay. Decay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained
because all transitions are detuned. Second, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because
there is no gap time in which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit. Third,
the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. Fourth, the Rabi frequency and $V$ in our scheme are
of similar magnitude, which permits a fast implementation of the gate when both of them are of the
experimentally feasible magnitude of several megahertz. The rapidity, accuracy, and feasibility
of this interference method can lay the foundation for entangling gates in universal quantum computing
with neutral atoms.
