We study deterministic and quantum dynamics from a constructive "finite" point of view, since the
introduction of a continuum, or other actual infinities in physics poses serious conceptual and
technical difficulties, without any need for these concepts to physics as an empirical science.
For a consistent description of the symmetries of dynamical systems at different times and the symmetries
of the various parts of such systems, we introduce discrete analogs of the gauge connections. Gauge
structures are particularly important to describe the quantum behavior. We show that quantum behavior
is the result of a fundamental inability to trace the identity of indistinguishable objects in the
process of evolution. Information is available only on invariant statements and values, relating
to such objects. Using mathematical arguments of a general nature we can show that any quantum dynamics
can be reduced to a sequence of permutations. Quantum interferences occur in the invariant subspaces
of permutation representations of symmetry groups of dynamical systems. The observable values
can be expressed in terms of permutation invariants. We also show that for the description of quantum
phenomena, instead of a nonconstructive number system --- the field of complex numbers, it is enough
to use cyclotomic fields --- the minimal extentions of natural numbers suitable for quantum mechanics.
Finite groups of symmetries play a central role in this article. The interest in such groups has an
additional motivation in physics. Numerous experiments and observations in particle physics
point to an important role of finite groups of relatively low orders in a number of fundamental processes.
