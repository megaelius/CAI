A central question in classical information theory is that of source compression, which is the task
where Alice receives a sample from a known probability distribution and needs to transmit it to the
receiver Bob with small error. This problem has a one-shot solution due to Huffman, in which the messages
are of variable length and the expected length of the messages matches the asymptotic and i.i.d.
compression rate of the Shannon entropy of the source. In this work, we consider a quantum extension
of above task, where Alice receives a sample from a known probability distribution and needs to transmit
a part of a pure quantum state (that is associated to the sample) to Bob. We allow entanglement assistance
in the protocol, so that the communication is possible through classical messages, for example
using quantum teleportation. The classical messages can have a variable length and the goal is to
minimize their expected length. We provide a characterization of the expected communication cost
of this task, by giving a lower bound that is near optimal up to some additive factors. A special case
of above task, and the quantum analogue of the source compression problem, is when Alice needs to
transmit the whole of her pure quantum state. Here we show that there is no one-shot interactive scheme
which matches the asymptotic and i.i.d. compression rate of the von Neumann entropy of the average
quantum state. This is a relatively rare case in quantum information theory where the cost of a quantum
task is significantly different from its classical analogue. Further, we also exhibit similar
results for the fully quantum task of quantum state redistribution, employing some different techniques.
We show implications for the one-shot version of the problem of quantum channel simulation.
