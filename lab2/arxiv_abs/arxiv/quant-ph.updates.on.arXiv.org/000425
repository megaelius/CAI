We elaborate a quantum model for the meaning associated with corpora of written documents, like
the pages forming the World Wide Web. To that end, we are guided by how physicists constructed quantum
theory for microscopic entities, which unlike classical objects cannot be fully represented in
our spatial theater. We suggest that a similar construction needs to be carried out by linguists
and computational scientists, to capture the full meaning carried by collections of documental
entities. More precisely, we show how to associate a quantum-like 'entity of meaning' to a 'language
entity formed by printed documents', considering the latter as the collection of traces that are
left by the former, in specific results of search actions that we describe as measurements. In other
words, we offer a perspective where a collection of documents, like the Web, is described as the space
of manifestation of a more complex entity - the QWeb - which is the object of our modeling, drawing
its inspiration from previous studies on operational-realistic approaches to quantum physics
and quantum modeling of human cognition and decision-making. We emphasize that a consistent QWeb
model needs to account for the observed correlations between words appearing in printed documents,
e.g., co-occurrences, as the latter would depend on the 'meaning connections' existing between
the concepts that are associated with these words. In that respect, we show that both 'context and
interference (quantum) effects' are required to explain the probabilities calculated by counting
the relative number of documents containing certain words and co-ocurrrences of words.
