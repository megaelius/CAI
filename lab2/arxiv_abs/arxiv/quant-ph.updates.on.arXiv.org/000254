We establish three different upper bounds on the energy-constrained quantum and private capacities
of bosonic thermal channels. The first upper bound, which we call the "data-processing bound,"
is obtained by decomposing a thermal channel as a pure-loss channel followed by a quantum-limited
amplifier channel. We prove that the data-processing bound can be at most 1.45 bits larger than a
known lower bound on these capacities of the thermal channel. The other two upper bounds, which we
call the "$\varepsilon$-degradable bound" and the $\"varepsilon$-close-degradable bound,"
are established using the notion of approximate degradability along with energy constraints.
A comparison of these three bounds shows that the data-processing bound is near to a known lower bound
for both low and high thermal noise and is very near to the $\varepsilon$-close-degradable bound
only for low thermal noise. Moreover, for certain parameter regimes, we show that the $\varepsilon$-degradable
bound is tighter than all other bounds. All three upper bounds are very near to a known lower bound
for the case of low thermal noise and high transmissivity. We also find improved achievable rates
of private communication through bosonic thermal channels, by employing coding schemes that make
use of displaced thermal states. We end by proving that an optimal Gaussian input state for the energy-constrained,
generalized channel divergence of two particular Gaussian channels is the two-mode squeezed vacuum
state that saturates the energy constraint. What remains open for several interesting channel
divergences, such as the diamond norm or the R\'enyi channel divergence, is to determine whether,
among all input states, a Gaussian state is optimal.
