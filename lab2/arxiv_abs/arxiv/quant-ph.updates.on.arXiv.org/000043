A realistic measurement-free theory for the quantum physics of multiple qubits is proposed. This
theory is based on a symbolic representation of a fractal state-space geometry which is invariant
under the action of deterministic and locally causal dynamics. This symbolic representation is
constructed from self-similar families of quaternionic operators. Using number-theoretic properties
of the cosine function, the statistical properties of the symbolic representation of the invariant
set are shown to be consistent with the contextual requirements of the Kochen-Specker theorem,
are not constrained by Bell inequalities, and mirror the statistics of entangled qubits. These
number-theoretic properties in turn reflect the sparseness of the invariant set in state space,
and relate to the metaphysical notion of counterfactual incompleteness. Using the concept of probability,
the complex Hilbert Space can be considered the completion of this symbolic representation into
the state space continuum. As a result, it is proposed that the complex Hilbert Space should merely
be considered a computational convenience in the light of the algorithmic intractability of the
invariant set geometry, and consequently the superposed state should not be considered a fundamental
aspect of physical theory. The physical basis for the proposed theory is relativistic gravity;
for example the symbols used to describe the invariant set themselves label gravitationally distinct
cosmological space-times. This implies that the very notion of a `quantum theory of gravity' may
be profoundly misguided - erroneously putting the quantum cart before the gravitational horse.
Here some elements of an alternative `gravitational theory of the quantum' are proposed, based
on a deterministic and locally causal theory of gravity which extends general relativity by being
geometric in both space-time and state space.
