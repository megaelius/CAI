Is the quantum state real? Does the reduction of the state of a quantum system by a measurement on another
system, entangled with it and distant, constitute a real disturbance? As is well acknowledged,
there is a lack of consensus among physicists over such ontological questions concerning quantum
mechanics (QM). Here we argue that it is possible, surprisingly, to address such questions on the
basis of only operational considerations. More generally, we show that the operational perspective
itself provides an intrinsic interpretation of QM. The theory's syntax supplies its semantics,
as it were. This interpretational framework, which we call ``signaling ontology'', builds on the
simple insight that unconditional quantum state reduction, namely the state change of a measured
quantum system due to a nonselective measurement, can be used for signaling locally, and that this
signal provides a natural, operational criterion for the reality of the state reduction. This argument
is formalized in the framework of generalized probability theories and extended to multipartite
systems. Among other consequences of this approach, the two questions posed above at the beginning
are testably answered in the affirmative. In particular, a steering inequality is proposed whose
violation, together with a local signaling condition, provides an experimental test for the reality
of the remote disturbance referenced in the second question. Accordingly, quantum correlations
that meet this criterion are nonlocal in an operationally real sense. A further ramification of
our work is an elucidation of the contrast between quantum no-signaling and relativistic signal
locality.
