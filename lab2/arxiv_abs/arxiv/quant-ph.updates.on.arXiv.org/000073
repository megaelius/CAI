Dual to the usual noisy channel coding problem, where a noisy (classical or quantum) channel is used
to simulate a noiseless one, reverse Shannon theorems concern the use of noiseless channels to simulate
noisy ones, and more generally the use of one noisy channel to simulate another. For channels of nonzero
capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be efficient, auxiliary resources of
the proper kind and amount are generally required. In the classical case, shared randomness between
sender and receiver is a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source,
but in the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation depend on both
the channel being simulated, and the source from which the channel inputs are coming. For tensor
power sources (the quantum generalization of classical IID sources), entanglement in the form
of standard ebits (maximally entangled pairs of qubits) is sufficient, but for general sources,
which may be arbitrarily correlated or entangled across channel inputs, additional resources,
such as entanglement-embezzling states or backward communication, are generally needed. Combining
existing and new results, we establish the amounts of communication and auxiliary resources needed
in both the classical and quantum cases, the tradeoffs among them, and the loss of simulation efficiency
when auxiliary resources are absent or insufficient. In particular we find a new single-letter
expression for the excess forward communication cost of coherent feedback simulations of quantum
channels (i.e. simulations in which the sender retains what would escape into the environment in
an ordinary simulation), on non-tensor-power sources in the presence of unlimited ebits but no
other auxiliary resource. Our results on tensor power sources establish a strong converse to the
entanglement-assisted capacity theorem.
