Entanglement sources that produce many entangled states act as a main component in applications
exploiting quantum physics such as quantum communication and cryptography. Realistic sources
are inherently noisy, cannot run for an infinitely long time, and do not necessarily behave in an
independent and identically distributed manner. An important question then arises -- how can one
test, or certify, that a realistic source produces high amounts of entanglement? Crucially, a meaningful
and operational solution should allow us to certify the entanglement which is available for further
applications after performing the test itself (in contrast to assuming the availability of an additional
source which can produce more entangled states, identical to those which were tested). To answer
the above question and lower bound the amount of entanglement produced by an uncharacterised source,
we present a protocol that can be run by interacting classically with uncharacterised (but not entangled
to one another) measurement devices used to measure the states produced by the source. A successful
run of the protocol implies that the remaining quantum state has high amounts of one-shot distillable
entanglement. That is, one can distill many maximally entangled states out of the single remaining
state. Importantly, our protocol can tolerate noise and, thus, certify entanglement produced
by realistic sources. With the above properties, the protocol acts as the first "operational device-independent
entanglement certification protocol" and allows one to test and benchmark uncharacterised entanglement
sources which may be otherwise incomparable.
