Several experimental implementations of cavity-magnon systems are presented. First an Yttrium
Iron Garnet (YIG) block is placed inside a re-entrant cavity where the resulting hybrid mode is measured
to be in the ultra strong coupling regime. When fully hybridised the ratio between the coupling rate
and uncoupled mode frequencies is determined to be $g/\omega=0.46$. Next a thin YIG cylinder is
placed inside a loop gap cavity. The bright mode of this cavity couples to the YIG sample and is similarly
measured to be in the ultra strong coupling regime with ratio of coupling rate to uncoupled mode frequencies
as $g/\omega=0.34$. A larger spin density medium such as lithium ferrite (LiFe) is expected to improve
couplings by a factor of 1.46 in both systems as coupling strength is shown to be proportional to the
square root of spin density and magnetic moment. Such strongly coupled systems are potentially
useful for cavity QED, hybrid quantum systems and precision dark matter detection experiments.
The YIG disc in the loop gap cavity, is, in particular, shown to be a strong candidate for dark matter
detection. Finally, a LiFe sphere inside a two post re-entrant cavity is considered. In past work
it was shown that the magnon mode in the sample has a turnover point in frequency. Additionally, it
was predicted that if the system was engineered such that it fully hybridised at this turnover point
the cavity-magnon polariton (CMP) transition frequency would become insensitive to both first
and second order magnetic bias field fluctuations, a result useful for precision frequency applications.
This work implements such a system by engineering the cavity mode frequency to near this turnover
point, with suppression in sensitivity to second order bias magnetic field fluctuations shown.
