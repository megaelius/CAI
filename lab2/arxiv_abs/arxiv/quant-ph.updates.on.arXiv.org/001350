We address the interaction between two quantum systems (A and B) that is mediated by their common
linear environment. If the environment is out of equilibrium the resulting interaction violates
Onsager relations and cannot be described by a Hamiltonian. In simple terms the action of system
A on system B does not necessarily produce a back-action. We derive general quantum equations describing
the situation and analyze in details their classical correspondence. Changing the properties
of the environment one can easily change and engineer the resulting interaction. It is tempting
to use this for quantum manipulation of the systems. However the resulting quantum gate is not always
unitary and may induce a loss of quantum coherence. For a relevant example we consider systems A and
B to be spins of arbitrary values and arrange the interaction to realize an analogue of the two-qubit
CNOT gate. The direction of spin A controls the rotation of spin B while spin A is not rotated experiencing
no back-action from spin B. We solve the quantum dynamics equations and analyze the purity of the
resulting density matrix. The resulting purity essentially depends on the initial states of the
systems. We attempt to find a universal characteristics of the purity optimizing it for the worst
choice of initial states. For both spins $s_A=s_B=1/2$, the optimized purity is bounded by 1/2 irrespective
of the details of the gate. We also study in detail the semiclassical limit of large spins. In this
case the optimized purity is bounded by $(1+\pi/2)^{-1}\approx0.39$. This is much better than
the typical purity of a large spin state $\sim s^{-1}$. We conclude that although the quantum manipulation
without back-action inevitably causes decoherence of the quantum states the actual purity of the
resulting state can be optimized and made relatively high.
