We establish that, in an appropriate limit, qubits of communication should be regarded as composite
resources, decomposing cleanly into independent correlation and transmission components. Because
qubits of communication can establish ebits of entanglement, qubits are more powerful resources
than ebits. We identify a new communications resource, the zero-bit, which is precisely half the
gap between them, replacing classical bits by zero-bits makes teleportation asymptotically reversible.
The decomposition of a qubit into an ebit and two zero-bits has wide-ranging consequences including
applications to state merging, the quantum channel capacity, entanglement distillation, quantum
identification and remote state preparation. The source of these results is the theory of approximate
quantum error correction. The action of a quantum channel is reversible if and only if no information
is leaked to the environment, a characterization that is useful even in approximate form. However,
different notions of approximation lead to qualitatively different forms of quantum error correction
in the limit of large dimension. We study the effect of a constraint on the dimension of the reference
system when considering information leakage. While the resulting condition fails to ensure that
the entire input can be corrected, it does ensure that all subspaces of dimension matching that of
the reference are correctable. The size of the reference can be characterized by a parameter $\alpha$,
we call the associated resource an $\alpha$-bit. Changing $\alpha$ interpolates between standard
quantum error correction and quantum identification, a form of equality testing for quantum states.
We develop the theory of $\alpha$-bits, including the applications above, and determine the $\alpha$-bit
capacity of general quantum channels, finding single-letter formulas for the entanglement-assisted
and amortised variants.
