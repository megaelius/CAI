Quantum networks consisting of quantum memories and photonic interconnects can be used for entanglement
distribution (L.-M.Duan and H. J. Kimble, PRL 90, 253601 (2003), H. J. Kimble, Nat. 453, 1023 EP (2008)),
quantum teleportation (S.Pirandola et.al, Nat. Photon. 9, 641 (2015)), and distributed quantum
computing (T.Spiller, et.al., New J. Phys. 8, 30 (2006). Remotely connected two-node networks
have been demonstrated using memories of the same type: trapped ion systems (D.Hucul, et.al, Nat.
Phys. 11, 37 (2014)), quantum dots (W. B. Gao et. al, Nat. Photon. 9, 363 (2015)), and nitrogen vacancy
centers (W. B. Gao et. al, Nat. Photon. 9, 363 (2015), B. Hensen, et. al., Nat. 526, 682 (2015)). Hybrid
systems constrained by the need to use photons with the native emission wavelength of the memory,
have been demonstrated between a trapped ion and quantum dot (H.Meyer et.al PRL 114, 123001 (2015))
and between a single neutral atom and a Bose-Einstein Condensate (M.Lettner et. al, PRL 106, 210503
(2011)). Most quantum systems operate at disparate and incompatible wavelengths to each other
so such two-node systems have never been demonstrated. Here, we use a trapped 138Ba$^{+}$ ion and
a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide, with a fiber coupled output, to demonstrate
19% end-to-end efficient quantum frequency conversion (QFC) of single photons from 493 nm to 780
nm. At the optimal signal-to-noise operational parameter, we use fluorescence of the ion to produce
light resonant with the $^{87}$Rb $D_2$ transition. To demonstrate the quantum nature of both the
unconverted 493 nm photons and the converted photons near 780 nm, we observe strong quantum statics
in their respective second order intensity correlations. This work extends the range of intra-lab
networking between ions and networking and communication between disparate quantum memories.
