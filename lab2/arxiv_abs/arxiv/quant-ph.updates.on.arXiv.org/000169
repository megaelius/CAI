Entanglement, a manifestation of quantumness of correlations between the observables of the subsystems
of a composite system, and the quantumness of their mutual information are widely studied characteristics
of a system of spin-1/2 particles. The concept of quantumness of correlations between the observables
of a system is based on incommensurability of the correlations with the predictions of some local
hidden variable (LHV) theory. However, the concept of quantumness of mutual information does not
invoke the LHV theory explicitly. In this paper, by invoking explicitly the local hidden variable
theory, a measure of quantumness of mutual information, $Q_{LHV}$, for a system of two spin-1/2
particles is proposed. It is based on finding the difference between the quantum and classical mutual
informations in which the classical mutual information corresponds to the joint probability of
the eigenvalues of the spins each along a specified direction. The proposed measure circumvents
the need of optimization when the Bloch vector of each spin is non-zero; the optimization is needed
but can be performed analytically exactly when the Bloch vector of each spin vanishes and is simplified
when the Bloch vector of only one of the spins is zero. In essence, the proposed measure is identical
with the measurement induced disturbance when the Bloch vector of each of the spins is non-zero.
However, whereas the measurement induced disturbance is non-unique when the Bloch vector of one
or both the spins is zero, the proposed measure even then determines the quantumness of mutual information
unambiguously. The $Q_{LHV}$ is identical with the symmetric discord if the Bloch vector of each
spin vanishes. It is same as the quantum discord if the Bloch vector of only one spin is zero and if the
state in question possesses certain additional properties.
