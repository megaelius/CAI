Some versions of quantum theory treat wave function collapse as a fundamental physical phenomenon
to be described by explicit laws. One motivation is to find a consistent unification of quantum theory
and gravity, in which collapse prevents superpositions of space-times from developing. Another
is to invoke collapse to explain our perception of definite measurement outcomes. Combining these
motivations while avoiding two different collapse postulates seems to require that perceptibly
different physical states necessarily create significantly different mass distributions in
our organs of perception or brains. Bassi et al. investigated this question in the context of mass
density dependent spontaneous collapse models. By analysing the mechanism of visual perception
of a few photons in the human eye, they argued that collapse model parameters consistent with known
experiment imply that a collapse would take place in the eye within the human perception time of ~100ms,
so that a definite state of observing some or no photons would be created from an initial superposition.
I reanalyse their arguments, and note a key problem: they treat the relevant processes as though
they take place in vacuo, rather than in cytoplasm. This makes a significant difference, since the
models imply that superpositions collapse at rates that depend on the difference between the coarse
grained mass densities of their components. This increases the required collapse rate, most likely
by at least an order of magnitude and plausibly by significantly more. This casts some doubt on the
claim that there are collapse model parameters consistent with known experiment that imply collapse
times of <~ 100ms within the human eye. A complete analysis would require a very detailed understanding
of the physical chemistry and biology of rod cells at microscopic scales.
