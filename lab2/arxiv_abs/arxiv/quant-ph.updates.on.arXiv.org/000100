This is our Oct. 15, 2013 QIP submission (re-formatted). It will eventually be replaced by the journal
version with the same technical results and a new perspective of "Physical Randomness Extractors."
We consider the Equivalence Lemma (4.6) a fundamental principle and powerful tool for securely
composing untrusted-device protocols. E.g., it has immediate implications on "unbounded randomness
expansion." The abstract below is new. How can one be certain that the output of an alleged random
number generator is indeed random? This question is important not only for the security and the efficiency
of modern day information processing, but also for understanding how fundamentally unpredictable
events are possible in the physical world. The mathematical theory of randomness extraction from
weak randomness sources shows that such certainty is possible only when two or more {\em independent}
sources are available. To circumvent this fundamental and hard-to-enforce limit, here we propose
a framework of extracting randomness from physical systems, and base the security on the validity
of physical theories. We further demonstrate provably secure randomness extraction from untrusted
devices that may be malicious but are nevertheless constrained by quantum mechanics and special
relativity, using only one additional classical source that may even be known to the adversary and
correlated strongly with the device. Our protocol tolerates a constant level of implementation
imprecision, can reach close to optimal security and is efficient for important cases. Thus our
result enables practical and provably secure randomness generation with a minimal assumption
on the source and the generating devices. It also implies that unless the world is deterministic,
we can experimentally create inherently random events and be confident of its unpredictability.
