Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the quantification of coherence or other coherence-like
concepts within the framework of quantum resource theory. However, rigorously defined or not,
the notion of coherence or decoherence has already been used by the community for decades since the
advent of quantum theory. Intuitively, the definitions of coherence and decoherence should be
the two sides of the same coin. Therefore, a natural question is raised: how can the conventional
decoherence processes, such as the von Neumann-L\"{u}ders (projective) measurement postulation
or partially dephasing channels, fit into the bigger picture of the recently established theoretic
framework? Here we show that the state collapse rules of the von Neumann or L\"{u}ders-type measurements,
as special cases of genuinely incoherent operations (GIO), are consistent with the resource theories
of quantum coherence. New hierarchical measures of coherence are proposed for the L\"{u}ders-type
measurement and their relationship with measurement-dependent discord is addressed. Moreover,
utilizing the fixed point theory for $C^\ast$-algebra, we prove that GIO indeed represent a particular
type of partially dephasing (phase-damping) channels which have a matrix representation based
on the Schur product. By virtue of the Stinespring's dilation theorem, the physical realizations
of incoherent operations are investigated in detail and we find that GIO in fact constitute the core
of strictly incoherent operations (SIO) and generally incoherent operations (IO) and the unspeakable
notion of coherence induced by GIO can be transferred to the theories of speakable coherence by the
corresponding permutation or relabeling operators.
