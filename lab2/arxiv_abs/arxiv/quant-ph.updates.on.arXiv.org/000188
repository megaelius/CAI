The modes of the electromagnetic field are solutions of Maxwell's equations taking into account
the material boundary conditions. The field modes of classical optics - properly normalized - are
also the mode functions of quantum optics. Quantum physics adds that the excitation within each
mode is quantized in close analogy to the harmonic oscillator. A complete set of mode functions forms
a basis with which any new modes can be reconstructed. In full generality each electromagnetic mode
function in the four dimensional space-time is mathematically equivalent to a harmonic oscillator.
The quantization of the electromagnetic field defines the excitation per mode and the correlation
between modes. In classical optics there can be oscillations and stochastic fluctuations of amplitude,
phase, polarization et cetera. In quantum optics there are in addition uncertain quantum field
components, quantum correlations and quantized energies. Here, we present selected topics from
classical to quantum optics. We start with the classical optics description of a light field and
its spectral densities, their measurement and their interpretation. In the second chapter the
quantum properties of a single light mode are reviewed as well as ways to measure these quantum properties.
Gaussian states of a light mode are emphasized, i. e. states for which the Wigner function has a two
dimensional Gaussian shape. The third chapter will be concerned with more than one mode presenting
a unifying approach to quadratic Hamiltonians including phase conjugation which is related to
time reversal. The fourth and last chapter describes the use of time reversal symmetry in optics,
focusing on the fundamental quantum optical process of the interaction of a single photon with a
single atom in free space.
