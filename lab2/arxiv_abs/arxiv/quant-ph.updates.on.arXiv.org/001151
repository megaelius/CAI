Recently, the notion of circuit complexity defined in symmetry group manifolds has been related
to geometric actions which generally arise in the coadjoint orbit method in representation theory
and play an important role in geometric quantization. On the other hand, it is known that there exists
a precise relation between geometric actions and Berry phases defined in group representations.
Motivated by these connections, we elaborate on a relation between circuit complexity and the group
theoretic Berry phase. As the simplest setup relevant for holography, we discuss the case of two
dimensional conformal field theories. In the large central charge limit, we identify the computational
cost function with the Berry connection in the unitary representation of the Virasoro group. We
then use the latter identification to express the Berry phase in terms of the Virasoro circuit complexity.
The former can be seen as the holonomy of the Berry connection along the path in the group manifold
which defines the protocol. In addition, we derive a proportionality relation between Virasoro
circuit complexity and the logarithm of the inner product between a particularly chosen reference
state and the prepared target state. In this sense, the logarithmic formula turns out to be approximating
the complexity up to some additive constant if the building blocks of the circuit are taken to be the
underlying symmetry gates. Predictions based on this formula have recently been shown to coincide
with the holographic complexity proposals and the path integral optimization procedure. The found
connections may therefore help to better understand such coincidences. We also discuss that our
findings, put together with earlier observations, may suggest a connection between the Virasoro
Berry phase and the complexity measure in the path integral optimization proposal.
