This article is an investigation of the effectiveness of quantum mechanics when a finite region
of space is omitted from analysis; this is done as part of a method to resolve the nature of short-ranged
interactions without explicitly modeling them. This is accomplished with an artificial boundary
behind which obscured short-ranged physical effects may operate. This may be necessary for two
reasons: (1) there are phenomena that operate over a short (but non-zero) range that cannot be reliably
modeled with a potential function and/or (2) the entire Hamiltonian being used is expected to lose
its predictive power when applied at short distances. Omitting a finite volume of the space from
analysis implies that the strict unitarity requirement of quantum mechanics must be relaxed, since
particles can actually propagate beyond the boundary. Strict orthogonality of eigenmodes and
hermiticity of the Hamiltonian must also be relaxed in this method; however, all of these canonical
relations are obeyed when averaged over sufficiently long times. A free function of integration
that depends on momentum is interpreted as a function encoding information needed to match a long-distance
wavefunction to an appropriate state function on the other side of the boundary. What is achieved
appears to be an effective long wavelength theory, at least for stationary systems. As examples,
the quantum defect theory of the one-dimensional Coulomb interaction is recovered, as well as a
new perspective of the inverse-square potential. Potential applications of this method may include
three-dimensional atomic systems and two-dimensional systems, such as graphene.
