We describe the finite-element modeling and fabrication of chip-based superconducting traps
for levitating micrometer-sized superconducting particles. Such experiments promise to lead
to a new generation of macroscopic quantum experiments and of force and acceleration sensors. An
accurate modeling of the utilized trap architectures is crucial for predicting parameters of the
traps, such as trap stability, frequency and levitation height, in realistic situations accounting
for the finite extent of the involved superconducting objects. To this end, we apply a modeling method
that is applicable to arbitrary superconducting structures in the Meissner state. It is based on
Maxwell-London equations in the static regime using the A-V formulation. The modeling allows us
to simulate superconducting objects with arbitrary geometry subject to arbitrary magnetic field
distributions and captures finite volume effects like magnetic field expulsion. We use this modeling
to simulate two chip-based trap architectures: an anti-Helmholtz coil-type trap and a planar double-loop
trap. We calculate important parameters of the superconducting traps for the cases of levitating
micrometer-sized particles of either spherical, cylindrical or ring shape. We compare our modeling
results to analytical test cases for idealized geometries. We also model detection of the motion
of the levitated particle by measurement of flux-changes induced in a nearby pick-up loop. We demonstrate
the fabrication of these chip-based traps and particles using thin Nb films. Our modeling is generic
and has applications beyond the one considered, such as for designing superconducting magnetic
shields or for calculating filling factors in superconducting resonators.
