As the title implies the article describes the possibility of taking into account the relativistic
correction to the field current density of the field emission of electrons from the metal. The article
provides the reader with some analytic generalization of the Fowler-Nordheim equation with the
relativistic correction. The relativistic correction to the Fowler-Nordheim equation makes
it possible to take into account the influence of the relativism on the field emission current. It
is especially noted that the consideration of this correction is necessary in the case of sufficiently
strong electric fields and relatively large interelectrode distances. It should be stressed that
this correction is valid for fixed interelectrode distances that decrease with increasing electric
field strength. It means that for the electric field strength of 0.1 to 1 GV/m the interelectrode
distance should not exceed values of 1 to 0.1 cm. First in the article it is spoken in detail about finding
of the electron wave function. Next the field emission current calculations are given. As a result
the transmission coefficient of the potential step from the Klein-Gordon equation within the framework
of the Fowler-Nordheim approximation is found. It is shown that in the case of the interelectrode
distance less than 1 cm, an analytical expression for the field electron emission current density
is obtained. The conclusion that usually relativistic correction does not exceed a tenth of a percent
is made. But in the case of the field electron emission from pulsars (where the work function and electric
field strength are much higher) the contribution of the relativistic correction about 10 % has been
established.
