We study the non-equilibrium evolution of concurrence of a Bell pair constituted of two qubits,
through the measurement of Loschmidt echo (LE) under the scope of generalized central spin model.
Having detected the Griffiths phase via derivative of LE in equilibrium, we show that in the non-equilibrium
situation, the spin chain requires a temporal window to realize the effect of disorder. We show that
within this timescale, LE falls off exponentially and this decay is maximally controlled by the
initial states and coupling strength. Our detail investigation suggests that there actually exist
three types of exponential decay, a Gaussian decay in ultra short time scale followed by two exponential
decay in the intermediate time with two different decay exponents. The effect of the disorder starts
appearing in the late time power law fall of LE where the power law exponent is strongly dependent
on disorder strength and the final state but almost independent of initial states and coupling strength.
This feature allows us to indicate the presence of Griffiths phase. To be precise, continuously
varying critical exponent and wide distribution of relaxation time imprint their effect in LE in
the late time limit where the power law fall is absent for quenching to a Griffiths phase. Here, LE
vanishes following the fast exponential fall. Interestingly, for off-critical quenching LE attains
a higher saturation value for increasing disorder strength, otherwise vanishes for a clean spin
chain, referring to the fact that disorder prohibits the rapid decay of entanglement in long time
limit. Moreover, we show that disorder is also able to destroy the light cone like nature of post quench
quasi-particles as LE does not sense the singular time scales appearing for clean spin chain with
qubits coupled at symmetric positions.
