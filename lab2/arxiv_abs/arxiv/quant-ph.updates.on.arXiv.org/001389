A critical reconsideration of the EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paper shows that the EPR argument
can be developed without using the concept of `element of physical reality', thus eliminating any
philosophical element in the logical chains of the paper. Deprived of its philosophical ornament,
the EPR argument plainly reduces to require what quantum mechanics can not do: to assign definite
values to two incompatible physical quantities. Hidden variables theories built up according
to Bell - type theorems are formulated on the basis of the assumption that the locality condition
implies the statistical independence between two measurements space - like separated. This assumption
is valid only with the additional one that statistical dependence between two measurements requires
a causal connection between them. This additional assumption rules out the possibility that statistical
dependence may due to an intrinsic property of the physical system under study. Therefore, hidden
variables theories are built up with a restriction which leads them to be disproved by experiment.
Quantum mechanical non - locality, invoked for describing EPR - type experiments, is strictly connected
to the hypothesis (NDV hypothesis) according to which the twin photons of entangled pairs do not
have a definite polarization before measurements. Both hypotheses are used only for describing
EPR experiments and not for making predictions. Therefore, they can be dropped without reducing
the predictive power of quantum mechanics concerning entangled photons pairs. Furthermore, both
hypotheses can be experimentally tested by a modification of a standard experimental apparatus
designed for studying entangled photons pairs.
