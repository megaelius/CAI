Parametric down-conversion (PDC) is mostly known in the low-gain (spontaneous) regime, in which
the correlated photon pairs are produced. Spontaneous PDC (SPDC) plays a very important role for
quantum optics as a variety of quantum states is produced via SPDC. In the high-gain case PDC leads
to generation of bright states having up to hundreds mW mean power. With such states almost any nonlinear
optical interaction or light-matter interaction becomes more efficient. Even being macroscopically
bright, the produced states maintain nonclassical properties as, for example, the fluctuations
of electric field quadratures are squeezed below the shot-noise level. The high-gain PDC could
be used not only in the same applications as SPDC, it also can provide new ones. Apart from that the
high-gain PDC has many remarkable spectral and statistical properties, which are in the focus of
this work. The description starts from the PDC generation in normal and anomalous group velocity
dispersion ranges. The spectrum and mode content of high-gain PDC is considered as well as their
change with the parametric gain are demonstrated. Then, there are the interference effects emerging
from the PDC correlations presented, namely the macroscopic analogue of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.
In addition, it is shown how spatial and temporal walk-off matching could be used for the generation
of giant narrowband twin beams. Finally, the statistical properties of high-gain PDC are reviewed
as well as their use for multiphoton effects is demonstrated. Photon-number fluctuations of PDC
are studied via normalized correlation functions and probability distributions. These fluctuations
enhance the generation efficiency for multiphoton effects by orders of magnitude and lead to tremendously
fluctuating light described by heavy-tailed photon-number probability distributions.
