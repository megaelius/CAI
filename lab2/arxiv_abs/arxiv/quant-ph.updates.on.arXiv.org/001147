Aharonov and Bohm noted that the wave-function of a charge acquires a detectable phase when superposed
along two paths enclosing an infinite solenoid, even though that wave-function is non-zero exclusively
where the solenoid's electric and magnetic fields are zero. This phase was long considered radically
different from all other quantum phases, because it seems explainable only via local action of gauge-dependent
potentials, not of the gauge-invariant electromagnetic fields. Recently Vaidman proposed a model
explaining the phase only in terms of the electron's (magnetic) field at the solenoid. Later Kang
proposed a Lagrangian model from which Vaidman's can be derived. However, their analysis is still
non-local. For it does not explain how the phase, generated at the solenoid, is detectable on the
charge when closing the interference loop. To explain this, one needs to quantise the EM field and
consider how the interaction between the solenoid and the electron is mediated by photons. In this
paper we propose a local model, where the field is quantised. This shows that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
phase is generated by the same quantum local mechanism as all other electromagnetic phases. Specifically,
it is mediated by the entanglement between the superposed charge and the photons. Surprisingly,
the quantised model produces some experimentally different predictions from the semiclassical
accounts of the AB phase, because it predicts that the phase at any point along the charge path is gauge-invariant
and locally generated, and therefore in principle detectable. We propose a realistic experiment,
within current technological reach, where the predicted phase difference along the path is measured
locally, by performing (a partial) quantum state tomography on the charge without closing the interfering
charge paths.
