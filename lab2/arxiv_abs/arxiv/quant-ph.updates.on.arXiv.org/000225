One axis twist spin squeezing leads to a Schroedinger Cat state, when the squeezing parameter is
tuned to a critical value. However, the nature of this state depends critically on the parity of N.
As such, conventional protocols do not reveal the enhancement in sensitivity achievable under
this condition. Recently, we proposed a protocol that employs squeezing followed by a rotation,
then an inversion of the rotation followed by unsqueezing, and measurement of the population of
a collective state. For even N, the fringes are narrowed by a factor of N. However, the signal to noise
ratio (SNR) decreases by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$. The enhancement in sensitivity, therefore, is
by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$, achieving the Heisenberg Limit (HL). For odd N, the signal is zero for all
phases. If all atoms from multiple trials are considered, with equal probability for each parity,
the sensitivity is at the Quasi Heisenberg Limit (QHL), defined as a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ below the
HL. Here, we show that the same limit can be reached without employing collective state detection.
The conventional technique of detecting the difference in the populations of the spin-up and spin-down
states leads to a narrowing of the fringes by a factor of N, for even N. The SNR decreases by a factor
of $\sqrt{N}$, so that the sensitivity reaches the HL. For odd N, the sensitivity is at the standard
quantum limit (SQL). If all trials are considered, the sensitivity is again at ~the QHL. The factor
of N reduction in the fringe width represents an N-fold phase magnification. We also describe a protocol
where the degree of sensitivity for odd and even N is reversed. We show that the same effects can also
be realized for an atomic clock. In systems such as nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond, where
it is possible to operate with a fixed parity, this protocol reaches the HL sensitivity.
