A design for a large-scale surface code quantum processor based on a node/network approach is introduced
for semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits. The minimal node contains only 7 quantum dots, and nodes
are separated on the micron scale, creating useful space for wiring interconnects and integration
of conventional transistor circuits. Entanglement is distributed between neighbouring nodes
by loading spin singlets locally and then shuttling one member of the pair through a linear array
of empty dots. Each node contains one data qubit, two ancilla qubits, and additional dots to facilitate
electron shuttling and measurement of the ancillas. A four-node GHZ state is realized by sharing
three internode singlets followed by local gate operations and ancilla measurements. Further
local operations and measurements produce an X or Z stabilizer on four data qubits, which is the fundamental
operation of the surface code. Electron shuttling is simulated using a simplified gate electrode
geometry without explicit barrier gates, and demonstrates that adiabatic transport is possible
on timescales that do not present a speed bottleneck to the processor. An important shuttling error
in a clean system is uncontrolled phase rotation due to the modulation of the electronic g-factor
during transport, owing to the Stark effect. This error can be reduced by appropriate electrostatic
tuning of the stationary electron's g-factor. Using reasonable noise models, we estimate error
thresholds with respect to single and two-qubit gate fidelities as well as singlet dephasing errors
during shuttling. A twirling protocol transforms the non-Pauli noise associated with exchange
gate operations into Pauli noise, making it possible to use the Gottesman-Knill theorem to efficiently
simulate large codes.
