Quantum multiparameter estimation involves estimating multiple parameters simultaneously
and can be more precise than estimating them individually. Our interest here is to determine fundamental
quantum limits to the achievable multiparameter estimation precision in the presence of noise.
We first present a lower bound to the estimation error covariance for a noisy initial probe state
evolving through a noiseless quantum channel. We then present a lower bound to the estimation error
covariance in the most general form for a noisy initial probe state evolving through a noisy quantum
channel. We find that these bounds for a probe comprising $N$ particles depend only on the one- and
two-particle reduced terms of the probe state. We also show conditions and accordingly measurements
to attain these estimation precision limits for noisy systems. The results here imply that the Heisenberg
precision scaling can be achieved even in the presence of noise. In fact, some noise in the initial
probe state or the quantum channel can serve as a feature rather than a bug, since the estimation precision
scaling achievable in the presence of noise in the initial state or the channel in some situations
is impossible in the absence of noise in the initial state or the channel. However, a lot of noise harms
the quantum advantage achievable with $N$ parallel resources. Furthermore, we show that the Heisenberg
precision limit can be beaten with noise in the quantum channel, unless it is unital, in which case
the best achievable estimation precision is the Heisenberg limit. We accordingly present a sub-Heisenberg
fundamental precision limit for non-unital channels.
