Since its publication, Aharonov and Vaidman's three-box paradox (1991) has undergone three major
advances: i). Their non-counterfactual scheme (2003) with strong rather than weak measurements,
enabling straightforward verification of the particle's subtle presence in two boxes at the same
time. ii) A recent realization of the latter scheme by Okamoto and Takeuchi (2016). iii) A dynamic
version by Aharonov et al. (2017), revealing an instantaneous disappearance and reappearance
of the particle between the boxes. We now suggest bringing the three advances together. Using photonic
quantum routers the particle within the three boxes acts like a quantum "shutter", capable of reflecting
another photon. Its whereabouts can therefore be revealed by a probe photon, appropriately split
in both space and time and then reflected by the pre- and post-selected shutter. Measuring the former
is expected to reveal the following time-evolution: The shutter particle has been in Boxes A+C at
t1, then only in C at t2, and finally in B+C at t3, and the probe photon was reflected by it from all these
locations at all these times. Another branch of the split probe photon can show that boxes A+B were
empty at t2. We then apply a Bell-like theorem to the correlations between the shutter and the probe
photon, challenging any alternative account that avoids disappearance-reappearance in favor
of some local hidden variables. An experimental scheme is proposed for testing these assertions.
Quantum superposition, unique in itself, may therefore comprise of even more unique time evolutions,
revealed later by the finer resolution of post-selection.
