General nonequilibrium quantum transport equations are derived for a coupled system of charge
carriers, Dirac spin, isospin (or valley spin), and pseudospin, such as either one of the band, layer,
impurity, and boundary pseudospins. Limiting cases are obtained for one, two or three different
kinds of spin ocurring in a system. We show that a characteristic integer number N_{s} determines
the formal form of spin quantum transport equations, irrespective of the type of spins or pseudospins,
as well as the maximal entanglement entropy. The results may shed a new perspective on the mechanism
leading to zero modes and chiral/helical edge states in topological insulators, integer quantum
Hall effect topological insulator (QHE-TI), and quantum spin Hall effect topological insulator
(QSHE-TI). It also shed new light in the observed competing weak localization and antilocalization
in spin-dependent quantum transport measurements. In particular, a novel mechanism of localization
and delocalization, as well as the new mechanism leading to the onset of superconductivity in bilayer
systems seems to emerge naturally from torque entanglements in nonequilibrium quantum transport
equations of spin and pseudospins. Moreover, the general results may serve as a foundation for engineering
approximations of the quantum transport simulations of spintronic devices based on graphene and
other 2-D materials such as the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), as well as based on topological
materials exhibiting quantum spin Hall effects. The extension of the formalism to spincaloritronics
and pseudo-spincaloritronics is straightforward.
