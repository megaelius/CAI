In physics, there is the prevailing intuition that we are part of a unique external world, and that
the goal of physics is to understand and describe this world. This assumption of the fundamentality
of objective reality is often seen as a major prerequisite of any kind of scientific reasoning. However,
here I argue that we should consider relaxing this assumption in a specific way in some contexts.
Namely, there is a collection of open questions in and around physics that can arguably be addressed
in a substantially more consistent and rigorous way if we consider the possibility that the first-person
perspective is ultimately more fundamental than our usual notion of external world. These are questions
like: which probabilities should an observer assign to future experiences if she is told that she
will be simulated on a computer? How should we think of cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, and
what can we learn from the fact that measurements in quantum theory seem to do more than just reveal
preexisting properties? Why are there simple computable laws of physics in the first place? This
note summarizes a longer companion paper which constructs a mathematically rigorous theory along
those lines, suggesting a simple and unified framework (rooted in algorithmic information theory)
to address questions like those above. It is not meant as a "theory of everything" (in fact, it predicts
its own limitations), but it shows how a notion of objective external world, looking very much like
our own, can provably emerge from a starting point in which the first-person perspective is primary,
without apriori assumptions on the existence of "laws" or a "physical world". While the ideas here
are perfectly compatible with physics as we know it, they imply some quite surprising predictions
and suggest that we may want to substantially revise the way we think about some foundational questions.
