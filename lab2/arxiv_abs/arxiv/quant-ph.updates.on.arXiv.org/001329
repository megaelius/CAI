Fast and high-fidelity quantum state detection is essential for building robust spin-based quantum
information processing platforms in semiconductors. The Pauli spin blockade (PSB)-based spin-to-charge
conversion and its variants are widely used for the spin state discrimination of two-electron singlet-triplet
(ST$_0$) qubits; however, the single-shot measurement fidelity is limited by either the low signal
contrast, which depends on the charge sensor position, or the short lifetime of the triplet state
at the PSB energy detuning, especially due to strong mixing with singlet states at large magnetic
field gradients. Ultimately, the limited single-shot measurement fidelity leads to low visibility
of quantum operations. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method to achieve spin-to-charge conversion
of ST$_0$ qubit states using energy selective tunneling between doubly occupied quantum dots (QDs)
and electron reservoirs, commonly called Elzerman type readout. We demonstrate a single-shot
measurement fidelity of 93% and an S-T$_0$ oscillation visibility of 81% at a field gradient of 100
mT without the necessity to convert to intermediate metastable states first; this allows single-shot
readout with full electron charge signal contrast and, at the same time, long and tunable measurement
time with negligible effect of relaxation even at strong magnetic field gradients. Using an rf-sensor
positioned opposite to the QD array, we further apply this method to two ST$_0$ qubits and show that
high-visibility readout of two individual single-qubit gate operations is possible with a single
rf-sensor. We expect that our measurement scheme for two-electron spin states, analogous to single-electron
spin-to-charge conversion, can be applied to various hosting materials and provides a simplified
and unified route for multiple qubit state detection with high accuracy in QD-based quantum computing
platforms.
