Various Bell inequalities are trivial algebraic properties satisfied by each line of particular
data spreadsheets.It is surprising that their violation in some experiments, allows to speculate
about the existence of nonlocal influences in Nature and to doubt the existence of the objective
external physical reality. Such speculations are rooted in incorrect interpretations of quantum
mechanics and in a failure of local realistic hidden variable models to reproduce quantum predictions
for spin polarisation correlation experiments. These hidden variable models use counterfactual
joint probability distributions of only pairwise measurable random variables to prove the inequalities.
In real experiments Alice and Bob, using 4 incompatible pairs of experimental settings, estimate
imperfect correlations between clicks, registered by their detectors. Clicks announce detection
of photons and are coded by 1 or -1. Expectations of corresponding ,only pairwise measurable, random
variables are estimated and compared with quantum predictions. These estimates violate significantly
the inequalities. Since all these random variables cannot be jointly measured , a joint probability
distribution of them does not exist and various Bell inequalities may not be derived. Thus it is not
surprising that they are violated. Moreover,if contextual setting dependent parameters describing
measuring instruments are correctly included in the description, then imperfect correlations
between the clicks may be explained in a locally causal way. In this paper we review and rephrase several
arguments proving that the violation of various Bell inequalities may neither justify the quantum
nonlocality nor allow for doubt regarding the existence of atoms, electrons and other invisible
elementary particles which are building blocks of the visible world around us including ourselves.
