Any measurement is intended to provide information on a system, namely knowledge about its state.
However, we learn from quantum theory that it is generally impossible to extract information without
disturbing the state of the system or its correlations with other systems. In this paper we address
the issue of the interplay between information and disturbance for a general operational probabilistic
theory. The traditional notion of disturbance considers the fate of the system state after the measurement.
However, the fact that the system state is left untouched ensures that also correlations are preserved
only in the presence of local discriminability. Here we provide the definition of disturbance that
is appropriate for a general theory. Moreover, since in a theory without causality information
can be gathered also on the effect, we generalise the notion of no-information test. We then prove
an equivalent condition for no-information without disturbance-atomicity of the identity-namely
the impossibility of achieving the trivial evolution-the identity-as the coarse-graining of
a set of non trivial ones. We prove a general theorem showing that information that can be retrieved
without disturbance corresponds to perfectly repeatable and discriminating tests. Based on this,
we prove a structure theorem for operational probabilistic theories, showing that the set of states
of any system decomposes as a direct sum of perfectly discriminable sets, and such decomposition
is preserved under system composition. As a consequence, a theory is such that any information can
be extracted without disturbance only if all its systems are classical. Finally, we show via concrete
examples that no-information without disturbance is independent of both local discriminability
and purification.
