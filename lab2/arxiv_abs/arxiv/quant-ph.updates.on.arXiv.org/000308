We take the perspective of open quantum systems and examine from their nonequilibrium dynamics
the conditions when the physical quantities, their relations and the laws of thermodynamics become
well defined and viable for quantum many body systems. We first describe how an open system nonequilibrium
dynamics (ONEq) approach is different from the closed combined system + environment in a global
thermal state (CGTs) setup. Only after the open system equilibrates will it be amenable to conventional
thermodynamics descriptions, thus quantum thermodynamics (QTD) comes at the end rather than assumed
in the beginning. We see the open system approach having the advantage of dealing with nonequilibrium
processes as many experiments in the near future will call for. Because it spells out the conditions
of QTD's existence it can also aid us in addressing the basic issues in quantum thermodynamics from
first principles in a systematic way. We then study one broad class of open quantum systems where
the full nonequilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly, that of the quantum Brownian motion of $N$
strongly coupled harmonic oscillators, interacting strongly with a scalar field environment.
Here we focus on the internal energy, heat capacity and the Third Law. We show for this class of physical
models, amongst other findings, the extensive property of the internal energy, the positivity
of the heat capacity and the validity of the Third Law from the perspective of the behavior of the heat
capacity toward zero temperature. These conclusions obtained from exact solutions and quantitative
analysis clearly disprove claims of negative specific heat in such systems and dispel allegations
that in such systems the validity of the Third Law of thermodynamics relies on quantum entanglement.
