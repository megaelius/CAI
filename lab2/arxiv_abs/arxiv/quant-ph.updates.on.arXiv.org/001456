Levitated nanoparticles and microparticles are considered excellent candidates for the realization
of extremely isolated mechanical systems, with a huge potential impact in sensing applications
and in quantum physics. Unfortunately, popular active techniques such as optical levitation are
known to be limited in their ultimate performance by internal heating and photon scattering. In
contrast, magnetic levitation based on static fields may avoid these drawbacks, due to the unique
property of being completely passive. Here, we show experimentally that micromagnets levitated
above type I superconductors can indeed feature very low damping at low frequency and low temperature.
In our experiment, we detect 5 out of 6 rigid-body mechanical modes of a levitated ferromagnetic
microsphere, using a dc SQUID with a single pick up coil. The measured frequencies are in substantial
agreement with predictions based on ideal Meissner effect. We measure damping times $\tau$ exceeding
$10^4$ s and quality factors $Q$ beyond $10^7$, improving by $2-3$ orders of magnitude over previous
experiments based on the same principle. The ratio $T/\tau \approx 10^{-4}$ K/s, which sets the
limit for most sensing applications, is already at the state of the art for micro and nanosystems,
and can be further improved by cooling to millikelvin temperature. We investigate the possible
residual loss mechanisms besides gas collisions, and argue that much longer damping time can be
achieved with further effort and optimization. Our results open the way towards a new class of force
sensors and platforms for testing quantum mechanics at mesoscale, with potential application
to magnetometry and gravimetry. In particular, we show that our levitated micromagnet can outperform
existing magnetometers in terms of field resolution normalized over the sensing volume.
