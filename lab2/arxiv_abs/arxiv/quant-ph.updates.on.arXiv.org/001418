Bloch oscillations appear when an electric field is superimposed on a quantum particle that evolves
on a lattice with a tight-binding Hamiltonian (TBH), i.e., evolves via what we will call an \emph{electric
TBH}; this phenomenon will be referred to as \emph{TBH Bloch oscillations}. A similar phenomenon
is known to show up in so-called \emph{electric discrete-time quantum walks (DQWs)}; this phenomenon
will be referred to as \emph{DQW Bloch oscillations}. This similarity is particularly salient
when the electric field of the DQW is weak, i.e., small with respect to its maximum value $2\pi$. For
a wide, i.e., spatially extended initial condition, one numerically observes semi-classical
oscillations, i.e., oscillations of a localized particle, both for the electric TBH and the electric
DQW. More precisely: The numerical simulations strongly suggest that the semi-classical DQW Bloch
oscillations correspond to two counter-propagating semi-classical TBH Bloch oscillations.
In this work it is shown that, under certain assumptions, the solution of the electric DQW for a weak
electric field and a wide initial condition is well approximated by the superposition of two continuous-time
expressions, which are counter-propagating solutions of an electric TBH whose hopping amplitude
is the cosine of the \emph{arbitrary} coin-operator mixing angle. In contrast, if one wishes the
continuous-time approximation to hold for spatially localized initial conditions, one needs
at least the DQW to be lazy, as suggested by numerical simulations and by the fact that this has been
proven in the case of a vanishing electric field.
