The silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) material system is technologically important for
the implementation of electron spin-based quantum information technologies. Researchers predict
the need for an integrated platform in order to implement useful computation, and decades of advancements
in silicon microelectronics fabrication lends itself to this challenge. However, fundamental
concerns have been raised about the MOS interface (e.g. trap noise, variations in electron g-factor
and practical implementation of multi-QDs). Furthermore, two-axis control of silicon qubits
has, to date, required the integration of non-ideal components (e.g. microwave strip-lines, micro-magnets,
triple quantum dots, or introduction of donor atoms). In this paper, we introduce a spin-orbit (SO)
driven singlet-triplet (ST) qubit in silicon, demonstrating all-electrical two-axis control
that requires no additional integrated elements and exhibits charge noise properties equivalent
to other more model, but less commercially mature, semiconductor systems. We demonstrate the ability
to tune an intrinsic spin-orbit interface effect, which is consistent with Rashba and Dresselhaus
contributions that are remarkably strong for a low spin-orbit material such as silicon. The qubit
maintains the advantages of using isotopically enriched silicon for producing a quiet magnetic
environment, measuring spin dephasing times of 1.6 $\mu$s using 99.95% $^{28}$Si epitaxy for the
qubit, comparable to results from other isotopically enhanced silicon ST qubit systems. This work,
therefore, demonstrates that the interface inherently provides properties for two-axis control,
and the technologically important MOS interface does not add additional detrimental qubit noise.
