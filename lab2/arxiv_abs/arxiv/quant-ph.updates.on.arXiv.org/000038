The general expressions for the time development of the ensemble averages of E^- and E^-E^+ are found
for N two level molecules (TLMs) interacting with a single mode electromagnetic field. The TLMs
are assumed to be at equivalent mode positions in the field. In the main body of the paper, the general
results are then simplified by assuming that all TLMs are in the up state at time 0. Examples of spontaneous
emission behavior including both Super Radiant behavior and emission suppression are shown in
Appendix E while stimulated emission with all TLMs initially in the lower state is examined in Appendix
F. Both resonant and non resonant cases are considered in the main body. Analytic results are presented
for low numbers of TLMs. In the appendices, it will be shown that for the mean photon number large in
comparison to the number of TLMs, that the Average Field Approximation (AFA) is a useful representation
with much simpler analytic form. The validity of this approximation will also be examined. In the
main paper, a comparison between the exact results and results using the AFA will be presented for
a small number of TLMs and a large average photon number. It will be found that the results are in general
remarkably similar but for non resonance differ somewhat at a finer level of detail. Of interest
is that the ensemble averages for N TLMs is similar to the ensemble average for a single TLM multiplied
by the number of TLMs which is somewhat disappointing but is believed to be the consequence of assuming
that all TLMs are at equivalent mode positions and large mean photon number. Some results for smaller
photon number will also be presented
