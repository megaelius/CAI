The surface code, with a simple modification, exhibits ultra-high error correction thresholds
when the noise is biased towards dephasing. Here, we identify features of the surface code responsible
for these ultra-high thresholds. We provide strong evidence that the threshold error rate of the
surface code tracks the hashing bound exactly for all biases, and show how to exploit these features
to achieve significant improvement in logical failure rate. First, we consider the infinite bias
limit, meaning pure dephasing. We prove that the error threshold of the modified surface code for
pure dephasing noise is $50\%$, i.e., that all qubits are fully dephased, and this threshold can
be achieved by a polynomial time decoding algorithm. We demonstrate that the sub-threshold behavior
of the code depends critically on the precise shape and boundary conditions of the code. That is,
for rectangular surface codes with standard rough/smooth open boundaries, it is controlled by
the parameter $g=\gcd(j,k)$, where $j$ and $k$ are dimensions of the surface code lattice. We demonstrate
a significant improvement in logical failure rate with pure dephasing for co-prime codes that have
$g=1$, and closely-related beveled codes, which have a modified boundary. The effect is dramatic:
the same logical failure rate achievable with a square surface code and $n$ physical qubits can be
obtained with a co-prime or beveled surface code using only $O(\sqrt{n})$ physical qubits. Finally,
we use approximate maximum likelihood decoding to demonstrate that this improvement persists
for a general Pauli noise biased towards dephasing. In particular, comparing with a square surface
code, we observe a significant improvement in logical failure rate against biased noise using a
beveled surface code with approximately half the number of physical qubits.
