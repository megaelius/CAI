Quantum states for bipartite composite systems are categorised as either separable or entangled,
but the states can also be divided differently into Bell local or Bell non-local states. Bell states
are where the probability P(a,b|A,B,c) for measured outcomes a, b on sub-system observables A,
B for state preparation process c, is given by a local hidden variable theory (LHVT) form P(a,b|A,B,c)=Sum{h}P(h|c)P(a|A,c,h)P(b|B,c,h)
(where preparation c results in a probability distribution P(h|c) for hidden variables h, P(a|A,c,h),
P(b|B,c,h) are probabilities for measured outcome a,b on sub-system observable A,B when the hidden
variables are h. Quantum states where P(a,b|A,B,c) is not given by a LHVT form are Bell non-local
and lead to Bell inequality violation experiments. For the Bell local states there are three cases
depending on whether both, one of or neither of the sub-system LHVT probabilities are also given
by a quantum probability involving sub-system density operators. Cases where one or both are given
by a quantum probability are known as local hidden states (LHS) and such states are non-steerable.
The steerable states are the Bell local states where there is no LHS, or the Bell non-local states.
In a previous paper tests for entanglement for two mode systems involving identical massive bosons
were obtained. In the present paper we consider tests for EPR steering in such systems. We find that
spin squeezing in the any spin component, a weak correlation test, the Hillery-Zubairy spin variance
test and a two mode quadrature squeezing test all show that the LHS model fails, and hence the quantum
state is steerable. We also find a strong correlation test and a generalised version of the Hillery-Zubairy
spin variance test also show that EPR steering occurs.
