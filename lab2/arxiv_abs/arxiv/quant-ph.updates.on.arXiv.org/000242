The early Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill (GKP) proposal for encoding a qubit in an oscillator has
recently been followed by cat- and binomial-code proposals. Numerically optimized codes have
also been proposed, and we introduce new codes of this type here. These codes have yet to be compared
using the same error model; we provide such a comparison by determining the entanglement fidelity
of all codes with respect to the bosonic pure-loss channel (i.e., photon loss) after the optimal
recovery operation. We then compare achievable communication rates of the combined encoding-error-recovery
channel by calculating the channel's hashing bound for each code. Cat and binomial codes perform
similarly, with binomial codes outperforming cat codes at small loss probabilities. Despite not
being designed to protect against the pure-loss channel, GKP codes significantly outperform all
other codes for most values of the loss probability. We show that the performance of GKP and some binomial
codes increases monotonically with increasing average photon number of the codes. In order to corroborate
our numerical evidence of the cat/binomial/GKP order of performance occurring at small loss probabilities,
we analytically evaluate the quantum error-correction conditions of those codes. For GKP codes,
we find an essential singularity in the entanglement fidelity in the limit of vanishing loss probability.
In addition to comparing the codes, we draw parallels between binomial codes and discrete-variable
systems. First, we characterize one- and two-mode binomial as well as multi-qubit permutation-invariant
codes in terms of spin-coherent states. Such a characterization allows us to introduce check operators
and error-correction procedures for binomial codes. Second, we introduce a generalization of
spin-coherent states, extending our characterization to qudit binomial codes and yielding a new
multi-qudit code.
