We study the collective optical response of an atomic ensemble confined within a single-mode optical
cavity by stochastic electrodynamics simulations that include the effects of atomic position
correlations, internal level structure, and spatial variations in cavity coupling strength and
atom density. In the limit of low light intensity the simulations exactly reproduce the full quantum
field-theoretical description for cold stationary atoms and at higher light intensities we introduce
semiclassical approximations to atomic saturation that we compare with the exact solution in the
case of two atoms. We find that collective subradiant modes of the atoms, with very narrow linewidths,
can be coupled to the cavity field by spatial variation of the atomic transition frequency and resolved
at low intensities, and show that they can be specifically driven by tailored transverse pumping
beams. We show that the cavity optical response, in particular both the subradiant mode profile
and the resonance shift of the cavity mode, can be used as a diagnostic tool for the position correlations
of the atoms and hence the atomic quantum many-body phase. The quantum effects are found to be most
prominent close to the narrow subradiant mode resonances at high light intensities. Although an
optical cavity can generally strongly enhance quantum fluctuations via light confinement, we
show that the semiclassical approximation to the stochastic electrodynamics model provides at
least a qualitative agreement with the exact optical response outside the subradiant mode resonances
even in the presence of significant saturation of the atoms.
