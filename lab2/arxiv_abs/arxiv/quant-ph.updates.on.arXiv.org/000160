An important problem in the magnetoreception of birds is the identification of a host molecule for
a magnetically sensitive chemical reaction known as the radical-pair mechanism. Current experiments
and theory suggest cryptochrome (a class of receptor molecules) as a viable candidate. Cryptochrome
functions as a signalling molecule, triggering further chemical reactions that lead to a neural
signal when it attains a certain population in a particular state. Here we characterise cryptochrome
response times by proposing a simple model to describe its radical-pair reaction. A key element
of the reaction is the quantum coherent oscillations between singlet and triplet spin states of
the radicals. While this is essential for enabling the magnetic sensing of cryptochrome, coherent
state transitions can also increase the speed of certain processes. By using the well-known formalism
of Kraus maps from quantum information theory we study the influence of decoherence on how quickly
cryptochrome can signal. In particular we describe the radical-pair reaction as a quantum random
walk with a variable dephasing parameter for the singlet-triplet oscillations. This allows us
to study the state transitions of the radical pair subject to different levels of decoherence. We
find that for realistic system parameters (transition rates) obtained from the literature, dephasing
induces a change in cryptochrome signalling times of only a few percent. We thus argue that the process
is essentially robust to dephasing. This change is seen to occur over only a small window of dephasing
noise strengths. Artificial system parameters are also explored.
