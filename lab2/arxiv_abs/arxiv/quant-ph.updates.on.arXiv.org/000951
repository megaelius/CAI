A quantum walk describes the discrete unitary evolution of a quantum particle on a discrete graph.
Some quantum walks, referred to as the Weyl and Dirac quantum walks, provide a description of the
free evolution of relativistic quantum fields in a regime where the wave-vectors involved in the
particle state are small. The clash between the intrinsic discreteness of quantum walks and the
symmetries of special relativity can be resolved by rethinking the notion of a change of inertial
reference frame. We give here a definition of the latter that avoids a pre-defined space-time geometry,
in terms of a change of values of the constants of motion that leaves the walk operator unchanged.
Starting from the family of 1+1 dimensional Dirac quantum walks with all possible values of the mass
parameter, we introduce a unique walk encompassing the latter as an extra degree of freedom, and
we derive its group of changes of inertial frames. This symmetry group contains a non linear realization
of $SO^+(2,1) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^3$; since one of the two space-like dimensions does not correspond
to an actual spatial degree of freedom but rather the mass, we interpret it as a 2+1 dimensional de-Sitter
group. This group group contains also a non-linear realisation of the proper orthochronous Poincar\'e
group $SO^+(1,1) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^2$ in 1+1 dimension, as the ones considered within the framework
of doubly special relativity, which recovers the usual relativistic symmetry of the Dirac Equation
in the limit of small wave-vectors and masses. Surprisingly, if one considers the Dirac walk with
a fixed value of the mass parameter, the group of allowed changes of reference frame does not have
a consistent interpretation in the relativistic limit of small wave-vectors.
