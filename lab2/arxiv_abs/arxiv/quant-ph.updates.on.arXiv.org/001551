The actual theoretical research investigates the resonant high-energy spontaneous bremsstrahlung
of ultrarelativistic electrons with considerable energies in the field of a nucleus and a quasimonochromatic
laser wave. Under the resonant conditions within the laser field the intermediate virtual electron
transforms into the real particle. As a result, the accomplished analysis defines that the polar
emission angle characterizes the frequency of a spontaneous photon. The study derives the expressions
for the resonant differential cross-sections of the represented processes that realize simultaneous
registration of the frequency and radiation angle in correlation to the momentum of the initial
electron (for the channel A) and of the final electron (for the channel B) of the spontaneous photon
with absorption of $r$ wave photons ($r = 1, 2, 3,... $ - the number of a resonance). Additionally,
the distribution of the resonant differential cross-section as a function of the angle of the spontaneous
photon emission for the higher numbers of resonance ($r = 2, 3,... $) delineates a dependency with
a sharp peak maximum that coordinates to the particle radiation at the most probable frequency.
To summarize, the accomplished work represents that the resonant differential cross-section
acquires considerable magnitude. Thus, for the first resonance of the channel A the resonant differential
cross-section attains the $\sim 10^{12}$ order of a magnitude, and for the third resonance of the
channel B $\sim 10^5$ order of a magnitude (in the units of $\alpha Z^2 r_e^2$). Finally, numerous
scientific facilities with specialization in pulsed laser radiation (SLAC, FAIR, XFEL, ELI, XCELS)
may experimentally verify the constructed model calculations.
