A fundamental task in photonics is to characterise an unknown optical process, defined by properties
such as birefringence, spectral response, thickness and flatness. Amongst many ways to achieve
this, single-photon probes can be used in a method called quantum process tomography (QPT). Furthermore,
QPT is an essential method in determining how a process acts on quantum mechanical states. For example
for quantum technology, QPT is used to characterise multi-qubit processors and quantum communication
channels; across quantum physics QPT of some form is often the first experimental investigation
of a new physical process, as shown in the recent research into coherent transport in biological
mechanisms. However, the precision of QPT is limited by the fact that measurements with single-particle
probes are subject to unavoidable shot noise---this holds for both single photon and laser probes.
In situations where measurement resources are limited, for example, where the process is rapidly
changing or the time bandwidth is constrained, it becomes essential to overcome this precision
limit. Here we devise and demonstrate a scheme for tomography which exploits non-classical input
states and quantum interferences; unlike previous QPT methods our scheme capitalises upon the
possibility to use simultaneously multiple photons per mode. The efficiency---quantified by
precision per photon used---scales with larger photon number input states. Our demonstration
uses four-photon states and our results show a substantial reduction of statistical fluctuations
compared to traditional QPT methods---in the ideal case one four-photon probe state yields the
same amount of statistical information as twelve single probe photons.
