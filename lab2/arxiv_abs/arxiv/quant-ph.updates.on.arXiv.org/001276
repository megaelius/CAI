We address the dynamics of continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on planar 2D lattice graphs, i.e.
those forming a regular tessellation of the Euclidean plane (triangular, square, and honeycomb
lattice graphs). We first consider the free particle: on square and triangular lattice graphs we
observe the well-known ballistic behavior, whereas on the honeycomb lattice graph we obtain a sub-ballistic
one, although still faster than the classical diffusive one. We impute this difference to the different
amount of coherence generated by the evolution and, in turn, to the fact that, in 2D, the square and
the triangular lattices are Bravais lattices, whereas the honeycomb one is non-Bravais. From the
physical point of view, this means that CTQWs are not universally characterized by the ballistic
spreading. We then address the dynamics in the presence of a perpendicular uniform magnetic field
and study the effects of the field by two approaches: (i) introducing the Peierls phase-factors,
according to which the tunneling matrix element of the free particle becomes complex, or (ii) spatially
discretizing the Hamiltonian of a spinless charged particle in the presence of a magnetic field.
Either way, the dynamics of an initially localized walker is characterized by a lower spread compared
to the free particle case, the larger is the field the more localized stays the walker. Remarkably,
upon analyzing the dynamics by spatial discretization of the Hamiltonian (vector potential in
the symmetric gauge), we obtain that the variance of the space coordinate is characterized by pseudo-oscillations,
a reminiscence of the harmonic oscillator behind the Hamiltonian in the continuum, whose energy
levels are the well-known Landau levels.
