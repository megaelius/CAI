Just as classical information technology rests on a foundation built of interconnected information-processing
systems, quantum information technology (QIT) must do the same. A critical component of such systems
is the interconnect, a device or process that allows transfer of information between disparate
physical media, for example, semiconductor electronics, individual atoms, light pulses in optical
fiber, or microwave fields. While interconnects have been well engineered for decades in the realm
of classical information technology, quantum interconnects (QuICs) present special challenges,
as they must allow the transfer of fragile quantum states between different physical parts or degrees
of freedom of the system. The diversity of QIT platforms (superconducting, atomic, solid-state
color center, optical, etc.) that will form a quantum internet poses additional challenges. As
quantum systems scale to larger size, the quantum interconnect bottleneck is imminent, and is emerging
as a grand challenge for QIT. For these reasons, it is the position of the community represented by
participants of the NSF workshop on Quantum Interconnects that accelerating QuIC research is crucial
for sustained development of a national quantum science and technology program. Given the diversity
of QIT platforms, materials used, applications, and infrastructure required, a convergent research
program including partnership between academia, industry and national laboratories is required.
This document is a summary from a U.S. National Science Foundation supported workshop held on 31
October - 1 November 2019 in Alexandria, VA. Attendees were charged to identify the scientific and
community needs, opportunities, and significant challenges for quantum interconnects over the
next 2-5 years.
