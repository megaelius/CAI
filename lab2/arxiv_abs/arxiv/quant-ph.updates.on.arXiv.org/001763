The classical channel remote state preparation (ccRSP) is an important two-party primitive in
quantum cryptography. Alice (classical polynomial-time) and Bob (quantum polynomial-time)
exchange polynomial rounds of classical messages, and Bob finally gets random single-qubit states
while Alice finally gets classical descriptions of the states. In [T. Morimae, arXiv:2003.10712],
an information-theoretically-sound non-interactive protocol for the verification of quantum
computing was proposed. The verifier of the protocol is classical, but the trusted center is assumed
that sends random single-qubit states to the prover and their classical descriptions to the verifier.
If the trusted center can be replaced with a ccRSP protocol while keeping the information-theoretical
soundness, an information-theoretically-sound classical verification of quantum computing
is possible, which solves the long-standing open problem. In this paper, we show that it is not the
case unless BQP is contained in MA. We also consider a general verification protocol where the verifier
or the trusted center first sends quantum states to the prover, and then the prover and the verifier
exchange a constant round of classical messages. We show that the first quantum message transmission
cannot be replaced with an (even approximate) ccRSP protocol while keeping the information-theoretical
soundness unless BQP is contained in AM. We finally study the verification with the computational
soundness. We show that if a ccRSP protocol satisfies a certain condition even against any quantum
polynomial-time malicious prover, the replacement of the trusted center with the ccRSP protocol
realizes a computationally-sound classical verification of quantum computing. The condition
is weaker than the verifiability of the ccRSP.
