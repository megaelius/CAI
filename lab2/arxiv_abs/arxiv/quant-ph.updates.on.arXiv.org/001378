Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to
approximately solve NP optimization problems such as MAX-CUT. We describe a new application area
of QAOA circuits: graph structure discovery. We omit the time-consuming parameter-optimization
phase and utilize the dependence of QAOA energy on the graph structure for randomly or judiciously
chosen parameters to learn about graphs. In the first part, Following up on Wang et. al. and Brandao
et. al. we give explicit formulas. We show that the layer-one QAOA energy for the MAX-CUT problem
for three regular graphs carries exactly the information: {\em (# of vertices, # of triangles)}.
We have calculated our explicit formulas differently from \cite{wang2018quantum}, by developing
the notion of the $U$ polynomial of a graph $G$. Many of our discoveries can be interpreted as computing
$U(G)$ under various restrictions. The most basic question when comparing the structure of two
graphs is if they are isomorphic or not. We find that the QAOA energies separate all non-isomorphic
three-regular graphs up to size 18, all strongly regular graphs up to size 26 and the Praust and the
smallest Miyazaki examples. We observe that the QAOA energy values can be also used as a proxy to how
much graphs differ. Unfortunately, we have also found a sequence of non-isomorphic pairs of graphs,
for which the energy gap seems to shrink at an exponential rate as the size grows. Our negative findings
however come with a surprise: if the QAOA energies do not measurably separate between two graphs,
then both of their energy landscapes must be extremely flat (indistinguishable from constant),
already when the number of QAOA layers is intermediately large. This holds due to a remarkable uncoupling
phenomenon that we have only deduced from computer simulation.
