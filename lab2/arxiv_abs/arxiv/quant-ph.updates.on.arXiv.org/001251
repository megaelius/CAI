A novel approach to quantum communication has demonstrated that placing communication channels
in a quantum superposition of alternative configurations can boost the amount of transmissible
information beyond the limits of conventional quantum Shannon theory. Instances of this paradigm
are the superposition of different causal orderings of communication devices [Ebler et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 120, 120502 (2018); Salek et al., arXiv:1809.06655 (2018); Chiribella et al., arXiv:1810.10457
(2018)], or the superposition of information carriers' trajectories [Chiribella and Kristj\'ansson,
Proc. R. Soc. A 475, 20180903 (2019); Gisin et al., Phys. Rev. A 72, 012338 (2005); Abbott et al., arXiv:1810.09826
(2018)]. Recently, it was argued that the communication advantages presented in the first three
references above are not a genuine consequence of indefinite causal order but can be reproduced
by the coherent control of devices [Abbott et al., arXiv:1810.09826 (2018); Gu\'erin et al., Phys.
Rev. A 99, 062317 (2019)]. Here, we point out that these arguments set up an uneven comparison between
different types of quantum superpositions. To shed light on the discussion, we study communication
as a resource theory, formally specifying the communication resources and the allowed operations
on them. We argue that any reasonable resource theory of communication must prohibit the use of side-channels,
which allow a sender and a receiver to communicate independently of the communication channels
initially available to them. We show that the communication paradigms introduced in the first six
references above are compatible with such a resource-theoretic framework, while the counterexamples
proposed in [Gu\'erin et al., Phys. Rev. A 99, 062317 (2019)] create side-channels.
