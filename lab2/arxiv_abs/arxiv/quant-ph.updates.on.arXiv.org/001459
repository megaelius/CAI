General Relativity is today the best theory of gravity addressing a wide range of phenomena. Our
understanding of physical laws, from cosmology to local scales, cannot be properly formulated
without taking into account it. It is based on one of the most fundamental principles of Nature, the
Equivalence Principle, which represents the core of the Einstein theory of gravity. The confirmation
of its validity at different scales and in different contexts represents one of the main challenges
of modern physics both from the theoretical and the experimental points of view. A major issue related
to this principle is the fact that we actually do not know if it is valid at quantum level. Furthermore,
recent progress on relativistic theories of gravity have to take into account new issues like Dark
Matter and Dark Energy, as well as the validity of fundamental principles like local Lorentz and
position invariance. Experiments allow to set stringent constraints on well established symmetry
laws, on the physics beyond the Standard Model of particles and interactions, and on General Relativity
and its possible extensions. In this review, we discuss precision tests of gravity in General Relativity
and alternative theories and their relation with the Equivalence Principle. In the first part,
we discuss the Einstein Equivalence Principle according to its weak and strong formulation. We
recall some basic topics of General Relativity and the necessity of its extension. Some models of
modified gravity are presented in some details. The second part of the paper is devoted to the experimental
tests of the Equivalence Principle in its weak formulation. We present the results and methods used
in high-precision experiments, and discuss the potential and prospects for future experimental
tests.
