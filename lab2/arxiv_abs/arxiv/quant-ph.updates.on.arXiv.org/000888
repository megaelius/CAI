We study the spreading of initially-local operators under unitary time evolution in a 1d random
quantum circuit model which is constrained to conserve a $U(1)$ charge and its dipole moment, motivated
by the quantum dynamics of fracton phases. We discover that charge remains localized at its initial
position, providing a crisp example of a non-ergodic dynamical phase of random circuit dynamics.
This localization can be understood as a consequence of the return properties of low dimensional
random walks, through a mechanism reminiscent of weak localization, but insensitive to dephasing.
The charge dynamics is well-described by a system of coupled hydrodynamic equations, which makes
several nontrivial predictions in good agreement with numerics. Importantly, these equations
also predict localization in 2d fractonic circuits. Immobile fractonic charge emits non-conserved
operators, whose spreading is governed by exponents distinct to non-fractonic circuits. Fractonic
operators exhibit a short time linear growth of observable entanglement with saturation to an area
law, as well as a subthermal volume law for operator entanglement. The entanglement spectrum follows
semi-Poisson statistics, similar to eigenstates of MBL systems. The non-ergodic phenomenology
persists to initial conditions containing non-zero density of dipolar or fractonic charge. Our
work implies that low-dimensional fracton systems preserve forever a memory of their initial conditions
in local observables under noisy quantum dynamics, thereby constituting ideal memories. It also
implies that 1d and 2d fracton systems should realize true MBL under Hamiltonian dynamics, even
in the absence of disorder, with the obstructions to MBL in translation invariant systems and in
d>1 being evaded by the nature of the mechanism responsible for localization. We also suggest a possible
route to new non-ergodic phases in high dimensions.
