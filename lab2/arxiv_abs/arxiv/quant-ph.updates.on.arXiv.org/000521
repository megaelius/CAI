Geometric phases and holonomies (their non-commuting generalizations) are a promising resource
for the realization of high-fidelity quantum operations in noisy devices, due to their intrinsic
fault-tolerance against noise and experimental imperfections. Despite their conceptual appeal
and proven fault-tolerance, for a long time their practical use in quantum computing was limited
to proof of principle demonstrations. Only in 2012 Sj\"oqvist et al. formulated a strategy to generate
non-Abelian (i.e. holonomic) quantum gates through non-adiabatic transformation. Successful
experimental demonstrations of this concept followed on various physical qubit systems and proved
the feasibility of this fast, holonomic quantum gate concept. Despite these successes, the experimental
implementation of such non-Abelian quantum gates remains experimentally challenging since in
general the emergence of a suitable holonomy requires encoding of the logical qubit within a three
(or higher) level system being driven by two (or more) control fields. A very recent proposal by Liang
et al. offers an elegant solution generating a non-Abelian, geometric quantum gate on a simple,
two-level system driven by one control field. Exploiting the concept of transitionless quantum
driving it allows the generation of universal geometric quantum gates through superadiabatic
evolution. This concept thus generates fast and robust phase-based quantum gates on the basis of
minimal experimental resources. Here, we report on the first such implementation of a set of non-commuting
single-qubit superadiabatic geometric quantum gates on the electron spin of the negatively charged
nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. The realized quantum gates combine high-fidelity and fast
quantum gate performance. This provides a promising and powerful tool for large-scale quantum
computing under realistic, noisy experimental conditions.
