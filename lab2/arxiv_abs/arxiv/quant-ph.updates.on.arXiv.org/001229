We model a collection of $N$ two-level systems (TLSs) coupled to a multimode cavity via Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss
(MMST) dynamics, sampling both electronic and photonic zero-point energies (ZPEs) and propagating
independent trajectories in Wigner phase space. By investigating the ground state stability of
a single TLS, we use MMST dynamics to separately study both electronic ZPE effects (which would naively
lead to the breakdown of the electronic ground state) as well as photonic ZPE effects (which would
naively lead to spontaneous absorption). By contrast, including both effects (i.e., sampling
both electronic and photonic ZPEs) leads to the dynamical stability of the electronic ground state.
Therefore, MMST dynamics provide a practical way to identify the contributions of self-interaction
and vacuum fluctuations. More importantly, we find that MMST dynamics can predict accurate quantum
dynamics for both electronic populations and EM field intensity. For a single TLS in a cavity, MMST
dynamics correctly predict the initial exponential decay of spontaneous emission, Poincar\'e
recurrences, and the positional dependence of a spontaneous emission rate. For an array of $N$ equally
spaced TLSs with only one TLS excited initially, MMST dynamics correctly predict the modification
of spontaneous emission rate as a function of the spacing between TLSs. Finally, MMST dynamics also
correctly model Dicke's superradiance and subradiance (i.e., the dynamics when all TLSs are excited
initially) including the correct quantum statistics for the delay time (as found by counting trajectories,
for which a full quantum simulation is hard to achieve). Therefore, this work raises the possibility
of simulating large-scale collective light-matter interactions with methods beyond mean-field
theory.
