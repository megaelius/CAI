An important task in quantum physics is the estimation of local quantities for ground states of local
Hamiltonians. Recently, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] defined the complexity class P^QMA[log], and motivated
its study by showing that the physical task of estimating the expectation value of a local observable
against the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is P^QMA[log]-complete. In this paper, we continue
the study of P^QMA[log], obtaining the following results. (1) The P^QMA[log]-completeness result
of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] requires O(log(n))-local observables and Hamiltonians. We show that simulating
even a single qubit measurement on ground states of 5-local Hamiltonians is P^QMA[log]-complete,
resolving an open question of Ambainis. (2) We formalize the complexity theoretic study of estimating
two-point correlation functions against ground states, and show that this task is similarly P^QMA[log]-complete.
(3) P^QMA[log] is thought of as "slightly harder" than QMA. We justify this formally by exploiting
the hierarchical voting technique of [Beigel, Hemachandra, Wechsung, SCT 1989] to show P^QMA[log]
is in PP. This improves the containment QMA is in PP [Kitaev, Watrous, STOC 2000]. (4) A central theme
of this work is the subtlety involved in the study of oracle classes in which the oracle solves a promise
problem. In this vein, we identify a flaw in [Ambainis, CCC 2014] regarding a P^UQMA[log]-hardness
proof for estimating spectral gaps of local Hamiltonians. By introducing a "query validation"
technique, we build on [Ambainis, CCC 2014] to obtain P^UQMA[log]-hardness for estimating spectral
gaps under polynomial-time Turing reductions.
