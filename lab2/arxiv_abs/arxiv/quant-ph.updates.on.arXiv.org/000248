Quantum entanglement shared by remote network nodes serves as a valuable resource for promis- ing
applications in distributed computing, cryptography, and sensing. However, distributing entanglement
with high quality via fiber optic routes could be challenging due to the various decoherence mechanisms
in fibers. In particular, one of the primary polarization decoherence mechanisms in optical fibers
is polarization mode dispersion (PMD), which is the distortion of optical pulses by randomly varying
birefringences in the system. To mitigate effect of decoherence in entangled par- ticles, quantum
entanglement distillation (QED) algorithms have been proposed. One particular class, the recurrence
QED algorithms, stands out because it has relatively relaxed requirements on both the size of the
quantum circuits involved and on the initial quality of entanglement in particles. However, because
the number of particles required grows exponentially with the number of rounds of distillation,
an efficient recurrence algorithm needs to converge quickly. We present a recurrence QED algorithm
designed for photonic qubit pairs affected by PMD-degraded channels. Our proposed algorithm achieves
the optimal fidelity as well as the optimal success probability (conditional on that the optimal
fidelity is achieved) in every round of distillation. The attainment of optimal fidelity improves
the convergence speed of fidelity with respect to the rounds of distillation from linear to quadratic,
and hence significantly reduces the number of distillation rounds. Combined with the fact that
the optimal success probability is achieved, the proposed algorithm provides an efficient method
to distribute entangled states with high fidelity via optic fibers.
