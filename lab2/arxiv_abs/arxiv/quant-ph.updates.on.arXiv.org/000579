Probing an atomic resonance without disturbing it is an ubiquitous issue in physics. This problem
is critical in high-accuracy spectroscopy or for the next generation of atomic optical clocks.
Ultra-high resolution frequency metrology requires sophisticated interrogation schemes and
robust protocols handling pulse length errors and residual frequency detuning offsets . This review
reports recent progress and perspective in such schemes, using sequences of composite laser-pulses
tailored in pulse duration, frequency and phase, inspired by NMR techniques and quantum information
processing. After a short presentation of Rabi technique and NMR-like composite pulses allowing
efficient compensation of electromagnetic field perturbations to achieve robust population
transfers, composite laser-pulses are investigated within Ramsey's method of separated oscillating
fields in order to generate non-linear compensation of probe-induced frequency shifts. Laser-pulses
protocols such as Hyper-Ramsey (HR), Modified Hyper-Ramsey (MHR), Generalized Hyper-Ramsey
(GHR) and hybrid schemes are reviewed. These techniques provide excellent protection against
both probe induced light-shift perturbations and laser intensity variations. More sophisticated
schemes generating synthetic frequency-shifts are presented. They allow to reduce or completely
eliminate imperfect correction of probe-induced frequency-shifts even in presence of decoherence
due to the laser line-width. Finally, two universal protocols are presented which provide complete
elimination of probe-induced frequency shifts in the general case where both decoherence and relaxation
dissipation effects are present by using exact analytic expressions for phase-shifts and the clock
frequency detuning. These techniques might be applied to atomic, molecular and nuclear frequency
metrology, mass spectrometry as well as precision spectroscopy.
