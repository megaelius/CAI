The hallmark of topological phases is their robust boundary signature whose intriguing properties---such
as the one-way transport on the chiral edge of a Chern insulator and the sudden disappearance of surface
states forming open Fermi arcs on the surfaces of Weyl semimetals---are impossible to realize on
the surface alone. Yet, despite the glaring simplicity of non-interacting topological bulk Hamiltonians
and their concomitant energy spectrum, the detailed study of the corresponding surface states
has essentially been restricted to numerical simulation. In this work, however, we show that exact
analytical solutions of both topological and trivial surface states can be obtained for generic
tight-binding models on a large class of geometrically frustrated lattices in any dimension without
the need for fine-tuning of hopping amplitudes. Our solutions derive from local constraints tantamount
to destructive interference between neighboring layer lattices perpendicular to the surface
and provide microscopic insights into the structure of the surface states that enable analytical
calculation of many desired properties. We illustrate our general findings on a large number of
examples in two and three spatial dimensions. Notably, we derive exact chiral Chern insulator edge
states on the spin orbit-coupled kagome lattice, and Fermi arcs relevant for various recently synthesized
pyrochlore iridate slabs. Remarkably, each of the pyrochlore slabs exhibit Fermi arcs although
only the ones with a magnetic one-in-three-out configuration feature bulk Weyl nodes in realistic
parameter regimes. Our approach furthermore signal the absence of topological surface states,
which we illustrate for a class of models akin to the trivial surface of Hourglass materials KHg$X$.
