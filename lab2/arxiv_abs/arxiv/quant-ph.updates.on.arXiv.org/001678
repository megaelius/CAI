Semi-classical theories are approximations to quantum theory that treat some degrees of freedom
classically and others quantum mechanically. In the usual approach, the quantum degrees of freedom
are described by a wave function which evolves according to some Schr\"odinger equation with a Hamiltonian
that depends on the classical degrees of freedom. The classical degrees of freedom satisfy classical
equations that depend on the expectation values of quantum operators. In this paper, we study an
alternative approach based on Bohmian mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics the quantum system is not
only described by the wave function, but also with additional variables such as particle positions
or fields. By letting the classical equations of motion depend on these variables, rather than the
quantum expectation values, a semi-classical approximation is obtained that is closer to the exact
quantum results than the usual approach. We discuss the Bohmian semi-classical approximation
in various contexts, such as non-relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics and
quantum gravity. The main motivation comes from quantum gravity. The quest for a quantum theory
for gravity is still going on. Therefore a semi-classical approach where gravity is treated classically
may be an approximation that already captures some quantum gravitational aspects. The Bohmian
semi-classical theories will be derived from the full Bohmian theories. In the case there are gauge
symmetries, like in quantum electrodynamics or quantum gravity, special care is required. In order
to derive a consistent semi-classical theory it will be necessary to isolate gauge-independent
dependent degrees of freedom from gauge degrees of freedom and consider the approximation where
some of the former are considered classical.
