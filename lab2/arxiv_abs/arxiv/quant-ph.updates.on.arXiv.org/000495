Randomness is a defining element of mixing processes in nature and an essential ingredient to many
protocols in quantum information. In this work, we investigate how much randomness is required
to transform a given quantum state into another one. Specifically, we ask whether there is a gap between
the power of a classical source of randomness compared to that of a quantum one. We provide a complete
answer to these questions, by identifying provably optimal protocols for both classical and quantum
sources of randomness, based on a dephasing construction. We find that in order to implement any
noisy transition on a $d$-dimensional quantum system it is necessary and sufficient to have a quantum
source of randomness of dimension $\sqrt{d}$ or a classical one of dimension $d$. Interestingly,
coherences provided by quantum states in a source of randomness offer a quadratic advantage. The
process we construct has the additional features to be robust and catalytic, i.e., the source of
randomness can be re-used. Building upon this formal framework, we illustrate that this dephasing
construction can serve as a useful primitive in both equilibration and quantum information theory:
We discuss applications describing the smallest measurement device, capturing the smallest equilibrating
environment allowed by quantum mechanics, or forming the basis for a cryptographic private quantum
channel. We complement the exact analysis with a discussion of approximate protocols based on quantum
expanders deriving from discrete Weyl systems. This gives rise to equilibrating environments
of remarkably small dimension. Our results highlight the curious feature of randomness that residual
correlations and dimension can be traded against each other.
