We examine the performance of the single-mode GKP code and its concatenation with the toric code
for a noise model of Gaussian shifts, or displacement errors. We show how one can optimize the tracking
of errors in repeated noisy error correction for the GKP code. We do this by examining the maximum-likelihood
problem for this setting and its mapping onto a 1D Euclidean path-integral modeling a particle in
a random cosine potential. We demonstrate the efficiency of a minimum-energy decoding strategy
as a proxy for the path integral evaluation. In the second part of this paper, we analyze and numerically
assess the concatenation of the GKP code with the toric code. When toric code measurements and GKP
error correction measurements are perfect, we find that by using GKP error information the toric
code threshold improves from $10\%$ to $14\%$. When only the GKP error correction measurements
are perfect we observe a threshold at $6\%$. In the more realistic setting when all error information
is noisy, we show how to represent the maximum likelihood decoding problem for the toric-GKP code
as a 3D compact QED model in the presence of a quenched random gauge field, an extension of the random-plaquette
gauge model for the toric code. We present a new decoder for this problem which shows the existence
of a noise threshold at shift-error standard deviation $\sigma_0 \approx 0.243$ for toric code
measurements, data errors and GKP ancilla errors. If the errors only come from having imperfect
GKP states, this corresponds to states with just 4 photons or more. Our last result is a no-go result
for linear oscillator codes, encoding oscillators into oscillators. For the Gaussian displacement
error model, we prove that encoding corresponds to squeezing the shift errors. This shows that linear
oscillator codes are useless for quantum information protection against Gaussian shift errors.
