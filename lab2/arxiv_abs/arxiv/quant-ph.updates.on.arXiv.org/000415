With the rapid growth of quantum technologies, knowing the fundamental characteristics of quantum
systems and protocols is essential for their effective implementation. A particular communication
setting that has received increased focus is related to quantum key distribution and distributed
quantum computation. In this setting, a quantum channel connects a sender to a receiver, and their
goal is to distill either a secret key or entanglement, along with the help of arbitrary local operations
and classical communication (LOCC). In this work, we establish a general theory of energy-constrained,
LOCC-assisted private and quantum capacities of quantum channels, which are the maximum rates
at which an LOCC-assisted quantum channel can reliably establish secret key or entanglement, respectively,
subject to an energy constraint on the channel input states. We prove that the energy-constrained
squashed entanglement of a channel is an upper bound on these capacities. We also explicitly prove
that a thermal state maximizes a relaxation of the squashed entanglement of all phase-insensitive,
single-mode input bosonic Gaussian channels, generalizing results from prior work. After doing
so, we prove that a variation of the method introduced in [Goodenough et al., New J. Phys. 18, 063005
(2016)] leads to improved upper bounds on the energy-constrained secret-key-agreement capacity
of a bosonic thermal channel. We then consider a multipartite setting and prove that two known multipartite
generalizations of the squashed entanglement are in fact equal. We finally show that the energy-constrained,
multipartite squashed entanglement plays a role in bounding the energy-constrained LOCC-assisted
private and quantum capacity regions of quantum broadcast channels.
