The failure of distributivity in quantum logic is motivated by the principle of quantum superposition.
However, this principle can be encoded differently, i.e., in different logical-algebraic objects.
As a result, the logic of experimental quantum propositions might have various semantics: e.g.,
a semantics, in which the distributive law of propositional logic fails (quantum logic), or a semantics,
in which this law holds but the valuation relation -- i.e., the function from atomic propositions
into the set of two objects, true and false -- is not total (called supervaluationism). Consequently,
closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space (representing experimental quantum propositions)
could be organized in different structures -- i.e., a Hilbert lattice (or its generalizations)
identified with quantum logic, or a collection of invariant-subspace lattices (Boolean blocks
of contexts) identified with the supervaluational semantics. Then again, because one can verify
simultaneously only the propositions relating to the same context, to decide which semantics is
proper -- quantum logic or supervaluationism -- is not possible experimentally. Yet, the latter
allows simplifications of some no-go theorems in the foundation of quantum mechanics. In the present
paper, as an example, the Kochen-Specker theorem asserting the impossibility to interpret, within
the orthodox quantum formalism, projection operators as definite {0,1}-valued (preexistent)
properties, is taken. As it is demonstrated in the paper, in the supervaluational semantics this
theorem turns into a mere tautology just restating that there is no global assignment of truth values
to experimental quantum propositions in such a semantics.
