We study the recovery of Hermitian low rank matrices $X \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ from undersampled
measurements via nuclear norm minimization. We consider the particular scenario where the measurements
are Frobenius inner products with random rank-one matrices of the form $a_j a_j^*$ for some measurement
vectors $a_1,...,a_m$, i.e., the measurements are given by $y_j = \mathrm{tr}(X a_j a_j^*)$. The
case where the matrix $X=x x^*$ to be recovered is of rank one reduces to the problem of phaseless estimation
(from measurements, $y_j = |\langle x,a_j\rangle|^2$ via the PhaseLift approach, which has been
introduced recently. We derive bounds for the number $m$ of measurements that guarantee successful
uniform recovery of Hermitian rank $r$ matrices, either for the vectors $a_j$, $j=1,...,m$, being
chosen independently at random according to a standard Gaussian distribution, or $a_j$ being sampled
independently from an (approximate) complex projective $t$-design with $t=4$. In the Gaussian
case, we require $m \geq C r n$ measurements, while in the case of $4$-designs we need $m \geq Cr n \log(n)$.
Our results are uniform in the sense that one random choice of the measurement vectors $a_j$ guarantees
recovery of all rank $r$-matrices simultaneously with high probability. Moreover, we prove robustness
of recovery under perturbation of the measurements by noise. The result for approximate $4$-designs
generalizes and improves a recent bound on phase retrieval due to Gross, Kueng and Krahmer. In addition,
it has applications in quantum state tomography. Our proofs employ the so-called bowling scheme
which is based on recent ideas by Mendelson and Koltchinskii.
