The class of quantum operations known as Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) induces
a partial ordering on quantum states. We present the results of systematic numerical computations
related to the volume (with respect to the unitarily invariant measure) of the set of LOCC-convertible
bipartite pure states, where the ordering is characterised by an algebraic relation known as majorization.
The numerical results, which exploit a tridiagonal model of random matrices, provide quantitative
evidence that the proportion of LOCC-convertible pairs vanishes in the limit of large dimension,
and therefore support a previous conjecture by Nielsen. In particular, we show that the problem
is equivalent to the persistence of a non-Markovian stochastic process and the proportion of LOCC-convertible
pairs decays algebraically with a nontrivial persistence exponent. We extend this analysis by
investigating the distribution of the maximal success probability of LOCC-conversions. We show
a dichotomy in behaviour between balanced and unbalanced bipartitions. In the latter case the asymptotics
is somehow surprising: in the limit of large dimensions, for the overwhelming majority of pairs
of states a perfect LOCC-conversion is not possible; nevertheless, for most states there exist
local strategies that succeed in achieving the conversion with a probability arbitrarily close
to one. We present strong evidences of a universal scaling limit for the maximal probability of successful
LOCC-conversions and we suggest a connection with the typical fluctuations of the smallest eigenvalue
of Wishart random matrices.
