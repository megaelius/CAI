Phase diffusion invariably accompanies all phase estimation strategies -- quantum or classical.
A precise estimation of the former can often provide valuable understanding of the physics of the
phase generating phenomena itself. We theoretically examine the performance of fixed-particle
number probe states in the simultaneous estimation of phase and collective phase diffusion. We
derive analytical quantum limits associated with the simultaneous local estimation of phase and
phase diffusion within the quantum Cramer-Rao bound framework in the regimes of large and small
phase diffusive noise. The former is for a general fixed-particle number state and the latter for
Holland Burnett states, for which we show quantum-enhanced estimation of phase as well as phase
diffusion. We next investigate the simultaneous attainability of these quantum limits using projective
measurements acting on a single copy of the state in terms of a trade-off relation. In particular,
we are interested how this trade-off varies as a function of the dimension of the state. We derive
an analytical bound for this trade-off in the large phase diffusion regime for a particular form
of the measurement, and show that the maximum of 2, set by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, is attainable.
Further, we show numerical evidence that as diffusion approaches zero, the optimal trade-off relation
approaches 1 for Holland-Burnett states. These numerical results are valid in the small particle
number regime and suggest that the trade-off for estimating one parameter with quantum-limited
precision leads to a complete lack of precision for the other parameter as the diffusion strength
approaches zero. Finally, we provide numerical results showing behaviour of the trade-off for
a general value of phase diffusion when using Holland-Burnett probe states.
