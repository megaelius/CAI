The focus of this paper is on {\em quantum distributed} computation, where we investigate whether
quantum communication can help in {\em speeding up} distributed network algorithms. Our main result
is that for certain fundamental network problems such as minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, and
shortest paths, quantum communication {\em does not} help in substantially speeding up distributed
algorithms for these problems compared to the classical setting. In order to obtain this result,
we extend the technique of Das Sarma et al. [SICOMP 2012] to obtain a uniform approach to prove non-trivial
lower bounds for quantum distributed algorithms for several graph optimization (both exact and
approximate versions) as well as verification problems, some of which are new even in the classical
setting, e.g. tight randomized lower bounds for Hamiltonian cycle and spanning tree verification,
answering an open problem of Das Sarma et al., and a lower bound in terms of the weight aspect ratio,
matching the upper bounds of Elkin [STOC 2004]. Our approach introduces the {\em Server model} and
{\em Quantum Simulation Theorem} which together provide a connection between distributed algorithms
and communication complexity. The Server model is the standard two-party communication complexity
model augmented with additional power; yet, most of the hardness in the two-party model is carried
over to this new model. The Quantum Simulation Theorem carries this hardness further to quantum
distributed computing. Our techniques, except the proof of the hardness in the Server model, require
very little knowledge in quantum computing, and this can help overcoming a usual impediment in proving
bounds on quantum distributed algorithms.
