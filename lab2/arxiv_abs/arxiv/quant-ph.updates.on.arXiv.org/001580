This paper points out the importance of the assumption of locality of physical interactions, and
the concomitant necessity of propagation of an entity (in this case, off-shell quanta - virtual
gravitons) between two non-relativistic test masses in unveiling the quantum nature of linearized
gravity through a laboratory experiment. At the outset, we will argue that observing the quantum
nature of a system is not limited to evidencing $O\left(\hbar\right)$ corrections to a classical
theory: it instead hinges upon verifying tasks that a classical system cannot accomplish. We explain
the background concepts needed from quantum field theory and quantum information theory to fully
appreciate the previously proposed table-top experiments: namely forces arising through the
exchange of virtual (off-shell) quanta, as well as Local Operations and Classical Communication
(LOCC) and entanglement witnesses. We clarify the key assumption inherent in our evidencing experiment,
namely the locality of physical interactions, which is a generic feature of interacting systems
of quantum fields around us, and naturally incorporates micro-causality in the description of
our experiment. We also present the types of states the matter field must inhabit, putting the experiment
on firm relativistic quantum field theoretic grounds. At the end we use a non-local theory of gravity
to illustrate how our mechanism may still be used to detect the qualitatively quantum nature of a
force when the scale of non-locality is finite. We find that the scale of non-locality, including
the entanglement entropy production in local/ non-local gravity, may be revealed from the results
of our experiment.
