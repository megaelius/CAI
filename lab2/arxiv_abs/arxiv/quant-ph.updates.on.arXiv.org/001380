A correspondence is established between measure-preserving, ergodic dynamics of a classical
harmonic oscillator and a quantum mechanical gauge theory on two-dimensional Minkowski space.
This correspondence is realized through an isometric embedding of the $L^2(\mu)$ space on the circle
associated with the oscillator's invariant measure, $ \mu $, into a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$
of sections of a $\mathbb{C}$-line bundle over Minkowski space, equipped with a covariant derivative
induced from an SO$^+$(1,1) gauge field (connection 1-form) on the corresponding inertial frame
bundle. Under this embedding, the Hamiltonian operator of a Lorentz-invariant quantum system,
constructed as a natural Laplace-type operator on bundle sections, pulls back to the generator
of the unitary group of Koopman operators governing the evolution of classical observables of the
harmonic oscillator, with Koopman eigenfunctions of zero, positive, and negative eigenfrequency
corresponding to quantum eigenstates of zero ("vacuum"), positive ("matter"), and negative ("antimatter")
energy. The embedding also induces a pair of operators acting on classical observables of the harmonic
oscillator, exhibiting canonical position-momentum commutation relationships. These operators
have the structure of order-$1/2$ fractional derivatives, and therefore display a form of non-locality.
In a second part of this work, we study a quantum mechanical representation of the classical harmonic
oscillator using a one-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert algebras associated with
the transition kernel of a fractional diffusion on the circle, where a stronger notion of classical-quantum
consistency is established than in the $L^2(\mu)$ case.
