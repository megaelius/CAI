The design of quantum experiments can be challenging for humans. This can be attributed at least
in part to counterintuitive quantum phenomena such as superposition or entanglement. In experimental
quantum optics, computational and artificial intelligence methods have therefore been introduced
to solve the inverse-design problem, which aims to discover tailored quantum experiments with
particular desired functionalities. While some computer-designed experiments have been successfully
demonstrated in laboratories, these algorithms generally are slow, require a large amount of data
or work for specific platforms that are difficult to generalize. Here we present Theseus, an efficient
algorithm for the design of quantum experiments, which we use to solve several open questions in
experimental quantum optics. The algorithm' core is a physics-inspired, graph-theoretical representation
of quantum states, which makes it significantly faster than previous comparable approaches. The
gain in speed allows for topological optimization, leading to a reduction of the experiment to its
conceptual core. Human scientists can therefore interpret, understand and generalize the solutions
without performing any further calculations. We demonstrate Theseus on the challenging tasks
of generating and transforming high-dimensional, multi-photonic quantum states. The final solutions
are within reach of modern experimental laboratories, promising direct advances for empirical
studies of fundamental questions, as well as technical applications such as quantum communication
and photonic quantum information processing. In each case, the computer-designed experiment
can be interpreted and conceptually understood. We argue that therefore, our algorithm contributes
directly to the central aims of science.
