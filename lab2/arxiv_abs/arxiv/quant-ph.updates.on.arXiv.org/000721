We provide an $\Omega(log(n))$ lower bound for the depth of any quantum circuit generating the unique
groundstate of Kitaev's spherical code. No circuit-depth lower bound was known before on this code
in the general case where the gates can connect qubits even if they are far away; To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time a quantum circuit-depth lower bound is given for unique ground state of a {\it
gapped} local Hamiltonian. Providing a lower bound in this case seems more challenging, since such
systems exhibit exponential decay of correlations and standard lower bound techniques do not apply.
We prove our lower bound by introducing the new notion of $\gamma$-separation, and analyzing its
behavior using algebraic topology arguments. We extend out methods also to a wide class of polygonal
complexes beyond the sphere, and prove a circuit-depth lower bound whenever the complex does not
have a small "bottle neck" (in a sense which we define). Here our lower bound on the circuit depth is
only $\Omega(logloglog(n))$. We conjecture that the correct lower bound is at least $\Omega(log(log(n))$,
but this seems harder to achieve due to the possibility of hyperbolic geometry. For general simplicial
complexes the lack of geometrical restriction on the gates becomes considerably more problematic
than for the sphere, and we need to thoroughly modify the original argument in order to get a meaningful
bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the class of trivial quantum states is separated
from the class of unique ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians; we provide a survey of the current
status of this hierarchy for completeness.The tools developed here will be useful in various contexts
in which quantum circuit depth lower bounds are of interest, including the study of topological
order, quantum computational complexity and quantum algorithmic speedups.
