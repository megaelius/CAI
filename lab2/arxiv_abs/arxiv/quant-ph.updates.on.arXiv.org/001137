A full-dimensional \emph{ab initio} potential energy surface of spectroscopic quality is developed
for the van-der-Waals complex of a methane molecule and an argon atom. Variational vibrational
states are computed on this surface including all twelve (12) vibrational degrees of freedom of
the methane-argon complex using the GENIUSH computer program and the Smolyak sparse grid method.
The full-dimensional computations make it possible to study fine details of the interaction and
distortion effects and to make a direct assessment of the reduced-dimensionality models often
used in the quantum dynamics study of weakly bound complexes. A 12-dimensional (12D) vibrational
computation including only a single harmonic oscillator basis function (9D) to describe the methane
fragment (for which we use the ground-state effective structure as the reference structure) has
a 0.40 cm$^{-1}$ root-mean-square error (rms) with respect to the converged 12D bound-state excitation
energies, which is less than half of the rms of the 3D model set up with the $\langle r \rangle_0$ methane
structure. Allowing 10 basis functions for the methane fragment, the rms of the bound state vibrational
energies is reduced to 0.07 cm$^{-1}$, which is much better than the 3D models. The full-dimensional
potential energy surface correctly describes the dissociation of the system, which together with
further development of the variational (ro)vibrational methodology opens the route for the study
of the role of dispersion forces on the excited methane vibrations and the energy transfer from the
intra- to the intermolecular vibrational modes.
