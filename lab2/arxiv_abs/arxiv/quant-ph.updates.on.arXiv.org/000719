A fast spectral method (FSM) is developed to solve the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation for quantum gas
mixtures with generalized differential cross-sections. Spatially-homogeneous relaxation
problems are used to demonstrate that the FSM conserves mass and momentum/energy to the machine
and spectral accuracy, respectively. Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients
such as the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by the FSM, which
compare well with analytical solutions. Then, we apply the FSM to find the accurate transport coefficients
through an iterative scheme for the linearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity
and thermal conductivity of the three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting through
hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative difference between the accurate
and variational transport coefficients increases with the fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative
difference in the thermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical
to the degenerate limits, but that in the shear viscosity decreases. Finally, the shear viscosity
and diffusion coefficient have also been calculated for a two-dimensional equal-mole mixture
of Fermi gases. When the molecular mass of the two components are the same, our numerical results
agree well with the variational solution. However, when the molecular mass ratio is not one, large
discrepancies between the accurate and variational results are observed; our results are reliable
because (i) the method relies on no assumption and (ii) the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy
density satisfies the minimum bound predicted by the string theory.
