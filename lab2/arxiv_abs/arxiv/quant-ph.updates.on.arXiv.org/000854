In this work, we exhaustively investigate $1 \rightarrow 2$ local and nonlocal broadcasting of
entanglement as well as correlations beyond entanglement (geometric discord) using asymmetric
Pauli cloners with most general two qubit state as the resource. We exemplify asymmetric broadcasting
of entanglement using Maximally Entangled Mixed States. We demonstrate the variation of broadcasting
range with the amount of entanglement present in the resource state as well as with the asymmetry
in the cloner. We show that it is impossible to optimally broadcast geometric discord with the help
of these asymmetric Pauli cloning machines. We also study the problem of $1 \rightarrow 3$ broadcasting
of entanglement using non-maximally entangled state (NME) as the resource. For this task, we introduce
a method we call successive broadcasting which involves application of $1 \rightarrow 2$ optimal
cloning machines multiple times. We compare and contrast the performance of this method with the
application of direct $1 \rightarrow 3$ optimal cloning machines. We show that $1 \rightarrow 3$
optimal cloner does a better job at broadcasting than the successive application of $1 \rightarrow
2$ cloners and the successive method can be beneficial in the absence of $1 \rightarrow 3$ cloners.
We also bring out the fundamental difference between the tasks of cloning and broadcasting in the
final part of the manuscript. We create examples to show that there exist local unitaries which can
be employed to give a better range for broadcasting. Such unitary operations are not only economical,
but also surpass the best possible range obtained using existing cloning machines enabling broadcasting
of lesser entangled states. This result opens up a new direction in exploration of methods to facilitate
broadcasting which may outperform the standard strategies implemented through cloning transformations.
