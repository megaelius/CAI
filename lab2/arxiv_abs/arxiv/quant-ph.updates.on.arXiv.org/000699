We present a reconstruction of finite-dimensional quantum theory where all of the postulates are
stated entirely in diagrammatic terms, making them intuitive. Equivalently, they are stated in
category-theoretic terms, making them mathematically appealing. Again equivalently, they are
stated in process-theoretic terms, establishing the fact that the conceptual bare-bones of quantum
theory concerns the manner in which systems and processes compose. Aside from the diagrammatic
form, the key novel aspect of this reconstruction is the introduction of a new postulate, symmetric
purification. Unlike the ordinary purification postulate, symmetric purification applies equally
well to classical theory as well as quantum theory. We therefore first reconstruct the full process
theoretic description of quantum theory, consisting of composite classical-quantum systems
and their interactions, before restricting ourselves to just the `fully quantum' systems in a final
step. We propose two novel alternative manners of doing so, `no-leaking' (roughly that information
gain causes disturbance) and `purity of cups' (roughly the existence of entangled states). Interestingly,
these turn out to be equivalent in any process theory with cups and caps. Additionally, we show how
the standard purification postulate can then be seen as an immediate consequence of the symmetric
purification postulate and purity of cups. Other tangential results concern the specific frameworks
of generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs) and process theories (a.k.a.~CQM). Firstly, we
provide a diagrammatic presentation of GPTs, which, henceforth, can now be subsumed under process
theories. Secondly, we have now characterised necessary additional axioms for a process theory
to correspond to the Hilbert space model, and in particular, that a `sharp dagger' is indeed the right
choice of a dagger structure.
