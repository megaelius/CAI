Neural Networks Quantum States have been recently introduced as an Ansatz for describing the wave
function of quantum many-body systems. We show that there are strong connections between Neural
Networks Quantum States in the form of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and some classes of Tensor
Network states in arbitrary dimension. In particular we demonstrate that short-range Restricted
Boltzmann Machines are Entangled Plaquette States, while fully connected Restricted Boltzmann
Machines are String-Bond States with a non-local geometry and low bond dimension. These results
shed light on the underlying architecture of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and their efficiency
at representing many-body quantum states. String-Bond States also provide a generic way of enhancing
the power of Neural Networks Quantum States and a natural generalization to systems with larger
local Hilbert space. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of these different classes of states
and present a method to combine them together. This allows us to benefit from both the entanglement
structure of Tensor Networks and the efficiency of Neural Network Quantum States into a single Ansatz
capable of targeting the wave function of strongly correlated systems. While it remains a challenge
to describe states with chiral topological order using traditional Tensor Networks, we show that
Neural Networks Quantum States and their String-Bond States extension can describe a lattice Fractional
Quantum Hall state exactly. In addition, we provide numerical evidence that Neural Networks Quantum
States can approximate a chiral spin liquid with better accuracy than Entangled Plaquette States
and local String-Bond States. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of neural networks to describe
complex quantum wave functions and pave the way towards the use of String-Bond States as a tool in
more traditional machine learning applications.
