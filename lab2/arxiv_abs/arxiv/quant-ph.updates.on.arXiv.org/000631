This thesis reports progress in two domains, causal structures and microscopic thermodynamics,
both of which are pertinent in the development of quantum technologies. The first part is dedicated
to the analysis of causal structure, which encodes the relationship between observed variables,
in general restricting the set of possible correlations between them. Our considerations rely
on a recent entropy vector method. Based on this, we develop techniques for deriving entropic constraints
to differentiate between causal structures. We provide sufficient conditions for entropy vectors
to be realisable within a causal structure and derive new, improved necessary conditions in terms
of so-called non-Shannon inequalities. We also report that for a family of causal structures, including
the bipartite Bell scenario and the bilocal causal structure, entropy vectors are unable to distinguish
between classical and quantum causes, in spite of the existence of quantum correlations that are
not classically reproducible. Hence, further development is needed in order to understand cause
from a quantum perspective. In the second part we explore an axiomatic framework for modelling error-tolerant
processes in microscopic thermodynamics. Our axiomatisation allows for the accommodation of
finite precision levels, crucial for describing experiments in the microscopic regime. It leads
to the emergence of manageable quantities that give insights into the feasibility and expenditure
of processes, which for adiabatic processes are shown to be smooth entropy measures. Our framework
also leads to thermodynamic behaviour at the macroscopic scale, meaning that for thermodynamic
equilibrium states a unique function provides necessary and sufficient conditions for state transformations,
like in the traditional second law.
