We consider the one-particle Schro\"odinger operator in two dimensions with a periodic potential
and a strong constant magnetic field perturbed by slowly varying non-periodic scalar and vector
potentials, $\phi(\epsilon x)$ and $A(\epsilon x)$, for $\epsilon\ll 1$. For each isolated family
of magnetic Bloch bands we derive an effective Hamiltonian that is unitarily equivalent to the restriction
of the Schro\"odinger operator to a corresponding almost invariant subspace. At leading order,
our effective Hamiltonian can be interpreted as the Peierls substitution Hamiltonian widely used
in physics for non-magnetic Bloch bands. However, while for non-magnetic Bloch bands the corresponding
result is well understood, both on a heuristic and on a rigorous level, for magnetic Bloch bands it
is not clear how to even define a Peierls substitution Hamiltonian beyond a formal expression. The
source of the difficulty is a topological obstruction: In contrast to the non-magnetic case, magnetic
Bloch bundles are generically not trivializable. Thus, Peierls substitution Hamiltonians for
magnetic Bloch bands turn out to be pseudo-differential operators acting on sections of non-trivial
vector bundles over a two-torus, the reduced Brillouin zone. Part of our contribution is the construction
of a suitable Weyl calculus for such operators. As an application we construct a family of canonical
one-band Hamiltonians $H_\theta$ for magnetic Bloch bands with Chern number $\theta\in\mathbb{Z}$
that generalizes the Hofstadter model $H_{\theta=0}$ for a single non-magnetic Bloch band. It
turns out that the spectrum of $H_\theta$ is independent of $\theta$ and thus agrees with the Hofstadter
spectrum depicted in his famous (black and white) butterfly. However, the resulting Chern numbers
of subbands, corresponding to Hall conductivities, depend on $\theta$, and thus the models lead
to different colored butterflies.
