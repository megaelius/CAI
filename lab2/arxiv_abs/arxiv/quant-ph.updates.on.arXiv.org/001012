We present the design, construction and characterization of an experimental system capable of
supporting a broad class of quantum simulation experiments with hundreds of spin qubits using Be-9
ions in a Penning trap. This article provides a detailed overview of the core optical and trapping
subsystems, and their integration. We begin with a description of a dual-trap design separating
loading and experimental zones and associated vacuum infrastructure design. The experimental-zone
trap electrodes are designed for wide-angle optical access (e.g. for lasers used to engineer spin-motional
coupling across large ion crystals) while simultaneously providing a harmonic trapping potential.
We describe a near-zero-loss liquid-cryogen-based superconducting magnet, employed in both
trapping and establishing a quantization field for ion spin-states, and equipped with a dual-stage
remote-motor LN2LHe recondenser. Experimental measurements using a nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) probe demonstrate part-per-million homogeneity over 7 mm-diameter cylindrical volume,
with no discernible effect on the measured NMR linewidth from pulse-tube operation. Next we describe
a custom-engineered inbore optomechanical system which delivers ultraviolet (UV) laser light
to the trap, and supports multiple aligned optical objectives for top- and sideview imaging in the
experimental trap region. We describe design choices including the use of non-magnetic goniometers
and translation stages for precision alignment. Further, the optomechanical system integrates
UV-compatible fiber optics which decouple the system's alignment from remote light sources. Using
this system we present site-resolved images of ion crystals and demonstrate the ability to realize
both planar and three-dimensional ion arrays via control of rotating wall electrodes and radial
laser beams. Looking to future work, we include interferometric..
