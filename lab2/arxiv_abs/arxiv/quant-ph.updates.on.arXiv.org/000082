The concept of entangled quantum states is considered in the context of systems of identical particles,
based on the requirement that in order to represent physical states both for the overall system and
the sub-systems which may be entangled, the density operators must satisfy the symmetrisation
principle and global and local super-selection rules that prohibit states in which there are coherences
between differing particle numbers. These requirements and their justification are fully discussed.
In the second quantisation approach used, both the system and the sub-systems are modes (or sets
of modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different occupancies of the
modes. The definition of entangled states is based on first defining the non-entangled states -
after specifying which modes constitute the sub-systems. This paper mainly focuses on two mode
entanglement for massive bosons. Several inequalities involving variances and mean values of
operators involving mode annihilation, creation operators have been proposed as tests for two
mode entangled states, including the inequalities that define spin squeezing. Spin squeezing
criteria in two mode systems are examined, and spin squeezing is best considered for principle spin
operator components where the covariance matrix is diagonal. It is shown that the presence of spin
squeezing in at least one of the spin components requires entanglement of the relevant pair of modes.
Several of the other proposed tests for entanglement, including ones based on the sum of the variances
for two spin components are considered. All of the tests are still valid when the present concept
of entanglement based on the symmetrisation and super-selection rule criteria is applied, but
further tests have been obtained here. Sometimes the new tests are satisfied whilst than those obtained
in other papers are not.
