Analytical solutions for a tight-binding model are presented for a position-based qubit and N interacting
qubits realized by quasi-one-dimensional network of coupled quantum dots expressed by connected
or disconnected graphs of any topology in 2 and 3 dimensions where one electron is presented at each
separated graphs. Electron(s) quantum dynamic state is described under various electromagnetic
circumstances with an omission spin degree-of-freedom. The action of Hadamard and phase rotating
gate is given by analytical formulas derived and formulated for any case of physical field evolution
preserving the occupancy of two-energy level system. The procedure for heating up and cooling down
of the quantum state placed in position based qubit is described. The interaction of position-based
qubit with electromagnetic cavity is described. In particular non-local communication between
position based qubits is given. It opens the perspective of implementation of quantum internet
among electrostatic CMOS quantum computers (quantum chips). The interface between superconducting
Josephson junction and semiconductor position-based qubit implemented in coupled semiconductor
q-dots is described such that it can be the base for electrostatic interface between superconducting
and semiconductor quantum computer. Modification of Andreev Bound State in Josephson junction
by the presence of semiconductor qubit in its proximity and electrostatic interaction with superconducting
qubit is spotted by the minimalistic tight-binding model. The obtained results allow in creating
interface between semiconductor quantum computer and superconducting quantum computer. They
open the perspective of construction of QISKIT like software that will describe both types of quantum
computers as well as their interface.
