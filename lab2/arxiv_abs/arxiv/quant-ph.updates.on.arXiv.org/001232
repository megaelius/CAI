Cyclic systems of dichotomous random variables have played a prominent role in contextuality research,
describing such experimental paradigms as the KCBS, EPR-Bell, and Leggett-Garg ones in physics,
as well as conjoint binary choices in human decision making. Here, we present a theoretical analysis
of the degree of contextuality in cyclic systems (if they are contextual) and the degree of noncontextuality
in them (if they are not), without the commonly made assumption that they are consistently connected
(i.e., we allow for all possible forms of "disturbance" or "signaling" in them). We focus on two measures
of the degree of contextuality in contextual systems, CNT1 and CNT2. It has been previously shown
that only the latter can be naturally extended into a measure of the degree of noncontextuality in
noncontextual systems, NCNT2 . Both CNT2 and NCNT2 are defined as the L1-distance between a point
representing a cyclic system and the surface of the polytope representing all possible noncontextual
cyclic systems with the same single-variable marginals. We completely characterize this polytope,
as well as the polytope of all possible probabilistic couplings for cyclic systems with given single-variable
marginals. We establish that CNT2 is equal to CNT1 , and, in relation to the maximally tight Bell-type
inequality for (generally, inconsistently connected) cyclic systems, both these measures are
proportional to the absolute value of the difference between its two sides. For noncontextual cyclic
systems, the measure NCNT2 is shown to be proportional to the smaller of the same difference and the
L1 -distance to the surface of the box circumscribing the noncontextuality polytope. These simple
relations, however, do not generally hold beyond the class of cyclic systems, and noncontextuality
of a system does not follow from noncontextuality of its cyclic subsystems.
