In general, the relativistic wave equation considered to mathematically describe the so-called
Majorana particle is the Dirac equation with a real Lorentz scalar potential plus the so-called
Majorana condition. Naturally, depending on the representation that one uses, the resulting equation
type changes. It could be a real or a complex system of coupled equations, or it could even be a single
complex equation for a single component of the entire wave function. Any of these equations or systems
of equations could be referred to as a Majorana equation or Majorana system of equations because
it can be used to describe the Majorana particle. For example, in the Weyl representation, in (3+1)
dimensions, we can have two non-equivalent explicitly covariant complex first-order equations;
in contrast, in (1+1) dimensions, we have a complex system of coupled equations. In any case, whichever
equation or system of equations is used, the wave function that describes the Majorana particle
in (3+1) ((1+1)) dimensions is determined by four (two) real quantities. The aim of this paper is
to study and discuss all these issues from an algebraic point of view, highlighting the similarities
and differences that arise between these equations in the cases of (3+1) and (1+1) dimensions in
the Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana representations. Additionally, to reinforce this task, we rederive
and use results that come from a procedure already introduced by Case to obtain a two-component Majorana
equation in (3+1) dimensions. Likewise, we introduce for the first time an analogous procedure
in (1+1) dimensions and then use the results we obtain.
