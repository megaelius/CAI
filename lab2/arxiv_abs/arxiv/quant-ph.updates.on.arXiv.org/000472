We demonstrate the application of higher-order operator bases to the solution of standard optomechanics.
It has been shown that there exists higher-order effects at high intracavity photon occupations,
including inequivalency of red and blue side-band frequencies. Similarly, a higher-order resonance
shift exists which primarily appears as changes in the optical resonance frequency, while the mechanical
frequency should also be affected. As a result of optomechanical interactions with the zero-point
field, the mechanical frequency undergoes a temperature-dependent shift even in the absence of
external optical drive, which can be analyzed using the introduced method. We also have calculated
corrections to the optomechanical spring effect due to higher-order interactions, and shown that
these corrections can be quite important at low cavity photon numbers. This has been verified experimentally
and we are able to show a reasonably good fit to a set of measurements. It is shown that there exists
non-unique and various choices for the higher-order operators to solve the optomechanical interaction
with different multiplicative noise terms, among which a minimal basis with higher-order operators
offers exactly linear Langevin equations. Furthermore, the use of minimal basis fully decouples
one of the Langevin equations, leaving the whole standard optomechanical problem exactly solvable
by explicit expressions. Similar approach can be used outside the domain of standard optomechanics
to quadratic and all other types of nonlinear interactions in quantum physics. The presented approach
provides the first known method to explicitly estimate the population of coherent phonons in the
optomechanical cavity, or coherent phonon number, with high accuracy. We finally present a detailed
treatment of multiplicative noise as well as nonlinear dynamic stability phases by the method of
higher-order operators.
