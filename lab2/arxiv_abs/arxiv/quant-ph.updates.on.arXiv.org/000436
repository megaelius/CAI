The Winter Colloquium on the Physics of Quantum Electronics (PQE) has been a seminal force in quantum
optics and related areas since 1971. It is rather mindboggling to recognize how the concepts presented
at these conferences have transformed scientific understanding and human society. In January,
2017, the participants of PQE were asked to consider the equally important prospects for the future,
and to formulate a set of questions representing some of the greatest aspirations in this broad field.
The result is this multi-authored paper, in which many of the world's leading experts address the
following fundamental questions: (1) What is the future of gravitational wave astronomy? (2) Are
there new quantum phases of matter away from equilibrium that can be found and exploited - such as
the time crystal? (3) Quantum theory in uncharted territory: What can we learn? (4) What are the ultimate
limits for laser photon energies? (5) What are the ultimate limits to temporal, spatial, and optical
resolution? (6) What novel roles will atoms play in technology? (7) What applications lie ahead
for nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond? (8) What is the future of quantum coherence, squeezing,
and entanglement for enhanced superresolution and sensing? (9) How can we solve (some of) humanity's
biggest problems through new quantum technologies? (10) What new understanding of materials and
biological molecules will result from their dynamical characterization with free electron lasers?
(11) What new technologies and fundamental discoveries might quantum optics achieve by the end
of this century? (12) What novel topological structures can be created and employed in quantum optics?
