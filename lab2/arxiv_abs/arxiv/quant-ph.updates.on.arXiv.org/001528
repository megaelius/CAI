The title of our work is a paraphrase of the title of Asher Peres' paper \textit{Unperformed experiments
have no results}. We show what are the lessons to be learned from the gedankenexperiments presented
by Frauchiger and Renner (claim that quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself),
and Brukner (a no-go theorem for observer independent facts). One has to remember Bohr's remark
"the unambiguous account of proper quantum phenomena must, in principle, include a description
of all relevant features of experimental arrangement", which specifically to the gedankenexperiments
means: in all your quantum mechanical thinking about measurements, think in terms of the full quantum
measurement theory. The theory sees measurement as composed of two stages: pre-measurement (entanglement,
i.e. quantum correlation, of the measured system with the pointer variable), and next decoherence
via interaction with an environment, which leaves a record of the result. The nature of the second
stage is that the environment is beyond our control, thus the decoherence cannot be undone, neither
by the original observer nor by someone else. If one uses in the description of measurement only the
pre-measurement stage, there are no recorded results, and the process can be undone. We can have
a quantum-marker-quantum-eraser situation. The gedankenexperiments are effectively scenarios
of this type. The process described by Frauchiger and Renner is possible only if the Friends of the
Wigners constrain themselves to pre-measurements. We also present a version of Bell's inequality,
which holds for hypothetical 'outcomes' obtained by the Friends during their (pre-)measurements.
Inclusion of this notion is shown to be at odds with quantum mechanical predictions. Thus, it cannot
be used in any argumentation about a quantum process which involves pre-measurements.
