We examine the origin of the Newton-Schr\"odinger equations (NSEs) that play an important role
in alternative quantum theories (AQT), macroscopic quantum mechanics and gravity-induced decoherence.
We show that NSEs for individual particles do not follow from general relativity (GR) plus quantum
field theory (QFT). Contrary to what is commonly assumed, the NSEs are not the weak-field (WF), non-relativistic
(NR) limit of the semi-classical Einstein equation (SCE) (this nomenclature is preferred over
the `M\/oller-Rosenfeld equation') based on GR+QFT. The wave-function in the NSEs makes sense
only as that for a mean field describing a system of $N$ particles as $N \rightarrow \infty$, not that
of a single or finite many particles. From GR+QFT the gravitational self-interaction leads to mass
renormalization, not to a non-linear term in the evolution equations of some AQTs. The WF-NR limit
of the gravitational interaction in GR+QFT involves no dynamics. To see the contrast, we give a derivation
of the equation (i) governing the many-body wave function from GR+QFT and (ii) for the non-relativistic
limit of quantum electrodynamics (QED). They have the same structure, being linear, and very different
from NSEs. Adding to this our earlier consideration that for gravitational decoherence the master
equations based on GR+QFT lead to decoherence in the energy basis and not in the position basis, despite
some AQTs desiring it for the `collapse of the wave function', we conclude that the origins and consequences
of NSEs are very different, and should be clearly demarcated from those of the SCE equation, the only
legitimate representative of semiclassical gravity, based on GR+QFT.
