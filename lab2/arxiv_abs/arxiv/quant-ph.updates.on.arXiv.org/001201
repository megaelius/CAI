Increasing tensor powers of the $k\times k$ matrices $M_k({\mathbb{C}})$ are known to give rise
to a continuous bundle of $C^*$-algebras over $I=\{0\}\cup 1/\mathbb{N}\subset[0,1]$ with fibers
$A_{1/N}=M_k({\mathbb{C}})^{\otimes N}$ and $A_0=C(X_k)$, where $X_k=S(M_k({\mathbb{C}}))$,
the state space of $M_k({\mathbb{C}})$, which is canonically a compact Poisson manifold (with
stratified boundary). Our first result is the existence of a strict deformation quantization of
$X_k$ \`{a} la Rieffel, defined by perfectly natural quantization maps $Q_{1/N}: \tilde{A}_0\rightarrow
A_{1/N}$ (where $\tilde{A}_0$ is an equally natural dense Poisson subalgebra of $A_0$). We apply
this quantization formalism to the Curie--Weiss model (an exemplary quantum spin with long-range
forces) in the parameter domain where its $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in the
thermodynamic limit $N\raw\infty$. If this limit is taken with respect to the macroscopic observables
of the model (as opposed to the quasi-local observables), it yields a classical theory with phase
space $X_2\cong B^3$ (i.e\ the unit three-ball in $\R^3$). Our quantization map then enables us
to take the classical limit of the sequence of (unique) algebraic vector states induced by the ground
state eigenvectors $\Psi_N^{(0)}$ of this model as $N\raw\infty$, in which the sequence converges
to a probability measure $\mu$ on the associated classical phase space $X_2$. This measure is a symmetric
convex sum of two Dirac measures related by the underlying $\Z_2$-symmetry of the model, and as such
the classical limit exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking, too. Our proof of convergence is heavily
based on Perelomov-style coherent spin states and at some stage it relies on (quite strong) numerical
evidence. Hence the proof is not completely analytic, but somewhat hybrid.
