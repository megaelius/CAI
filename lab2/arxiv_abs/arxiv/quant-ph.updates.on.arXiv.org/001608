We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the cross-resonance gate operation covering estimates
for gate parameters and gate error as well as analyzing spectator qubits and multi-qubit frequency
collisions. We start by revisiting the derivation of effective Hamiltonian models following Magesan
et al. (arXiv:1804.04073). Transmon qubits are commonly modeled as a weakly anharmonic Kerr oscillator.
Kerr theory only accounts for qubit frequency renormalization, while adopting number states as
the eigenstates of the bare qubit Hamiltonian. Starting from the Josephson nonlinearity and by
accounting for the eigenstates renormalization, due to counter-rotating terms, we derive a new
starting model for the cross-resonance gate with modified qubit-qubit interaction and drive matrix
elements. Employing time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory, we derive an effective
Hamiltonian for the cross-resonance gate with estimates for the gate parameters calculated up
to the fourth order in drive amplitude. The new model with renormalized eigenstates lead to 10-15
percent relative correction of the effective gate parameters compared to Kerr theory. We find that
gate operation is strongly dependent on the ratio of qubit-qubit detuning and anharmonicity. In
particular, we characterize five distinct regions of operation, and propose candidate parameter
choices for achieving high gate speed and low coherent gate error when the cross-resonance tone
is equipped with an echo pulse sequence. Furthermore, we generalize our method to include a third
spectator qubit and characterize possible detrimental multi-qubit frequency collisions.
