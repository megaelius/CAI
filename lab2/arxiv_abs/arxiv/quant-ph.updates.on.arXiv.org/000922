$Al/AlO_x/Al$-layer systems are frequently used for Josephson junction-based superconducting
devices. Although much work has been devoted to the optimization of the superconducting properties
of these devices, systematic studies on influence of deposition conditions combined with structural
analyses on the nanoscale are rare up to now. We have focused on the optimization of the structural
properties of $Al/AlO_x/Al$-layer systems deposited on Si(111) substrates with a particular
focus on the thickness homogeneity of the $AlO_x$-tunnel barrier. A standard high-vacuum electron-beam
deposition system was used and the effect of substrate pretreatment, different Al-deposition
temperatures and Al-deposition rates was studied. Transmission electron microscopy was applied
to analyze the structural properties of the $Al/AlO_x/Al$-layer systems to determine the thickness
homogeneity of the $AlO_x$ layer, grain size distribution in the Al layers, Al-grain boundary types
and the morphology of the $Al/AlO_x$ interface. We show that the structural properties of the lower
Al layer are decisive for the structural quality of the whole $Al/AlO_x/Al$-layer system. Optimum
conditions yield an epitaxial Al(111) layer on a Si(111) substrate with an Al-layer thickness variation
of only 1.6 nm over more than 10 $\mu m$ and large lateral grain sizes up to 1 $\mu m$. Thickness fluctuations
of the $AlO_x$-tunnel barrier are minimized on such an Al layer which is essential for the homogeneity
of the tunnel current. Systematic variation of the Al-deposition rate and deposition temperature
allows to develop an understanding of the growth mechanisms.
