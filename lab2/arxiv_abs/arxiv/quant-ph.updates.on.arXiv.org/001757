The measurement of circular dichroism (CD) has widely been exploited to distinguish the different
enantiomers of chiral structures. It has been applied to natural materials (e.g. molecules) as
well as to artificial materials (e.g. nanophotonic structures). However, especially for chiral
molecules the signal level is very low and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio is of paramount
importance to either shorten the necessary measurement time or to lower the minimum detectable
molecule concentration. As one solution to this problem, we propose here to use quantum states of
light in CD sensing to reduce the noise below the shot noise limit that is encountered when using coherent
states of light. Through a multi-parameter estimation approach, we identify the ultimate quantum
limit to precision of CD sensing, allowing for general schemes including additional ancillary
modes. We show that the ultimate quantum limit can be achieved by various optimal schemes. It includes
not only Fock state input in direct sensing configuration but also twin-beam input in ancilla-assisted
sensing configuration, for both of which photon number resolving detection needs to be performed
as the optimal measurement setting. These optimal schemes offer a significant quantum enhancement
even in the presence of additional system loss. The optimality of a practical scheme using a twin-beam
state in direct sensing configuration is also investigated in details as a nearly optimal scheme
for CD sensing when the actual CD signal is very small. Alternative schemes involving single-photon
sources and detectors are also proposed. This work paves the way for further investigations of quantum
metrological techniques in chirality sensing.
