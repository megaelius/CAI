Quantum theory has an outstanding property, namely each state has its well defined purification
- a state extremal in the set of states in larger Hilbert space. It is known that the classical theory
and the theory of non-signaling boxes does not have purification for all of their states. These theories
are examples of the so called generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). However in any non-signaling
GPT each state has a number of extensions to a larger system. We single out the most relevant among
them, called a complete extension, unique up to local reversible operations on the extending system.
We prove that this special, finite dimensional extension bares an analogy to quantum purification
in that (i) it allows for an access to all ensembles of the extended system (ii) from complete extension
one can generate any other extension. It then follows, that an access to the complete extension represents
the total power of the most general non-signaling adversary. A complete extension of a maximally
mixed box in two-party binary input binary output scenario is up to relabeling the famous Popescu-Rohrlich
box. The latter thus emerges naturally without reference to the Bell's non-locality. However the
complete extension is not a purification (a vertex) in the generic case. Moreover, we show that all
convex discrete theories does not provide purification for almost all of it states. In particular
the theory of contextuality does not possess purification. The complete extensions are by nature
high-dimensional systems. We were able however to provide explicit structure of complete extension
for the noisy Popescu-Rohrlich-boxes and the 3-cycle contextual box.
