We develop a method for computing the Bogoliubov transformation experienced by a confined quantum
scalar field in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, due to the changes in the geometry and/or the confining
boundaries. The method constructs a basis of modes of the field associated to each compact Cauchy
hypersurface of constant time, by means of an eigenvalue problem posed in the hypersurface. The
Bogoliubov transformation between bases associated to different times can be computed through
a differential equation, which coefficients have simple expressions in terms of the solutions
to the mentioned eigenvalue problem. This transformation can be interpreted physically when it
connects two regions of the spacetime where the metric is static (typically the asymptotic past
and future), in which case it is precisely the transformation between the bases of modes with well-defined
frequency in the static regions. The method is of general applicability, under some minor assumptions.
It proves especially useful in the regime of small perturbations, where it allows one to easily make
quantitative predictions on the amplitude of the resonances of the field, providing a crucial tool
in the growing research area of confined quantum fields in table-top experiments. We give examples
within the perturbative regime (gravitational waves) and the non-perturbative regime (cosmological
particle creation). This is the first of two articles introducing the method, dedicated to spacetimes
without boundaries or with timelike boundaries that remain static in some synchronous gauge. A
second article will handle the spacetimes that do not fulfil these conditions.
