Recent study (Yuan et. al., Phys. Rev. B 102, 014422 (2020)) revealed a SOC-independent spin splitting
and spin polarization effect induced by antiferromagnetic ordering which do not necessarily require
breaking of inversion symmetry or the presence of SOC, hence can exist even in centrosymmetric,
low-Z light element compounds, considerably broadening the material base for spin polarization.
In the present work we develop the magnetic symmetry conditions enabling such effect, dividing
the 1651 magnetic space groups into 7 different spin splitting prototypes (SST-1 to SST-7). We use
the 'Inverse Design' approach of first formulating the target property (here, spin splitting in
low-Z compounds not restricted to low symmetry structures), then derive the enabling physical
design principles to search realizable compounds that satisfy these a priori design principles.
This process uncovers 422 magnetic space groups (160 centrosymmetric and 262 non-centrosymmetric)
that could hold AFM-induced, SOC-independent spin splitting and spin polarization. We then search
for stable compounds following such enabling symmetries. We investigate the electronic and spin
structures of some selected prototype compounds by density functional theory (DFT) and find spin
textures that are different than the traditional Rashba-Dresselhaus patterns. We provide the
DFT results for all antiferromagnetic spin splitting prototypes (SST-1 to SST-4) and concentrate
on revealing of the AFM-induced spin splitting prototype (SST-4). The symmetry design principles
along with their transformation into an Inverse Design material search approach and DFT verification
could open the way to their experimental examination.M). The symmetry design principles along
