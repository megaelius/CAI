Powerful future technologies based on coherent quantum dynamical systems require an unprecedented
level of control. Perhaps the greatest challenge in achieving such control is the decoherence induced
by the environment, a problem which pervades experimental quantum physics and is particularly
severe in the context of solid state quantum computing and nanoscale quantum devices because of
the inherently strong coupling to the surrounding material. Recent years have seen rapid improvement
in the quality of materials and in the design and fabrication of such systems, and it is crucial to
match this progress with similar advances in the external control protocols used to manipulate
quantum states so that the high levels of quantum coherence needed for technological applications
persist despite the invariable presence of environmental noise. Here, we present an analytical
approach that yields explicit constraints on the driving field which ensure that the leading-order
noise-induced errors in a qubit's evolution cancel exactly. We derive constraints for two of the
most common types of non-Markovian noise that arise in qubits: slow fluctuations of the qubit energy
splitting and fluctuations in the driving field itself. By theoretically recasting a phase in the
qubit's wavefunction as a topological winding number, we can satisfy the noise-cancelation conditions
by adjusting driving field parameters without altering the target state or quantum evolution.
We demonstrate our method by constructing robust quantum gates for two types of spin qubit: phosphorous
donors in silicon and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Our results constitute an important
step toward achieving robust generic control of quantum systems, bringing their novel applications
closer to realization.
