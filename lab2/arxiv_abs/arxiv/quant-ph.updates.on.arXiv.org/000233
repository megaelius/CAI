Achieving the Heisenberg limit (HL) in an experiment with very large number of atoms N is a challenging
task. One mechanism for doing so is to make use of the experimentally achievable one axis twist spin
squeezing in combination with unsqueezing which results in the generation of a Schr\"odinger cat
state corresponding to an equal superposition of the extremal Dicke collective states. However,
the protocol for achieving this result critically requires the knowledge of whether the total number
of atoms is even or odd. Here, we describe a protocol which employs null detection of one of the collective
states that circumvents this problem. Specifically, we show that this detection process produces
fringes that are narrowed by a factor of N with unit visibility when N is even, and yields zero signal
when N is odd. Thus, over repeated measurements under which the probability of N being even or odd
is equal, the signal from the odd cases get filtered out, and HL sensitivity is achieved for the $\sim
N/2$ atoms corresponding to the even cases. For all N atoms, the sensitivity is below the HL by a factor
of $\sqrt{2}$. We also show that a degree of sensitivity enhancement very close to this value can
also be achieved for a much lower degree of squeezing than what is required for reaching the cat states.
We show that the Schr\"odinger cat case corresponds to interference between collective states
with Compton frequencies $\sim 10^{31}$ Hz for $^{87}$Rb atoms with $N = 10^6$. Aside from conventional
application to precision metrology, such a Schr\"odinger cat atom interferometer may serve as
a test-bed for various aspects of fundamental physics, such as the effect of gravitational interaction
on macroscopic decoherence. Finally, we note that the proposed scheme can also be used to realize
an HL Schr\"odinger cat atomic clock, for which the base frequency is effectively enhanced by a factor
of N.
