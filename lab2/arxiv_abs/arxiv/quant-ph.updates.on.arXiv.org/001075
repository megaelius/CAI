It was known long ago that quantum theory and general relativity, two pillars of modern physics,
are in sharp conflict in their foundations. Their fundamental inconsistencies render a consistent
theory of quantum gravity the most challenging problem in physics. Here we propose an information-complete
quantum field theory (ICQFT), which describes elementary fermions, their gauge fields, and gravity
(together, called the trinary fields) as an elementary trinity without any conceptual inconsistency
of existing theories. We then argue that the ICQFT provides a coherent picture and conceptual framework
of unifying matter and spacetime (gravity) as information via spacetime-matter entanglement
and gives a compelling solution to the problem of time and time's arrow. The trinary fields are characterized
by dual entanglement and dual dynamics. Spacetime-matter entanglement encodes complete physical
predictions of the theory and allows us to give a quantum information definition of dark energy.
We consider two particular forms of spacetime-matter entangled states and their physical consequences.
One of them\ is consistent with the variational holographic relation and another results in an universal
relation between entanglement entropy and geometry (area and volume). This latter relation allows
us to determine the cosmological constant term in the classical Einstein equation and implies that
our Universe is not strictly holographic due to dark energy (related to an universal negative pressure).
We predict the interior quantum state of a Schwarzschild black hole to be maximally information-complete.
As a concrete quantum formulation of gravity coupled with matter, the ICQFT is about quantum information
dynamics for spacetime and matter and eliminates the conceptual obstacles of existing quantum
gravity theory.
