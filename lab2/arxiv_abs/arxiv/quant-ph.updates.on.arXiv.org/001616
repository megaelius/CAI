A detailed understanding of strong matter-photon interactions requires first-principle methods
that can solve the fundamental Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics
efficiently. A possible way to extend well-established electronic-structure methods to this
situation is to embed the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in a higher-dimensional light-matter hybrid
auxiliary configuration space. In this work we show the importance of the resulting hybrid Fermi-Bose
statistics of the polaritons, which are the new fundamental particles of the ``photon-dressed''
Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for systems in cavities. We show that violations of these statistics can
lead to unphysical results. We present an efficient way to ensure the proper symmetry of the underlying
wave functions by enforcing representability conditions on the dressed one-body reduced density
matrix. We further present a general prescription how to extend a given first-principles approach
to polaritons and as an example introduce polaritonic Hartree-Fock theory. While being a single-reference
method in polariton space, polaritonic Hartree-Fock is a multi-reference method in the electronic
space, i.e. it describes electronic correlations. We also discuss possible applications to polaritonic
QEDFT. We apply this theory to a lattice model and find that the more delocalized the bound-state
wave function of the particles is, the stronger it reacts to photons. The main reason is that within
a small energy range many states with different electronic configurations are available as opposed
to a strongly bound (and hence energetically separated) ground-state wave function. This indicates
that under certain conditions coupling to the quantum vacuum of a cavity can indeed modify ground
state properties.
