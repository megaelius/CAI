Ninety years ago in 1927, at an international congress in Como, Italy, Niels Bohr gave an address
which is recognized as the first instance in which the term "complementarity", as a physical concept,
was spoken publicly [1], revealing Bohr's own thinking about Louis de Broglie's "duality". Bohr
had very slowly accepted duality as a principle of physics: close observation of any quantum object
will reveal either wave-like or particle-like behavior, one or the other of two fundamental and
complementary features. Little disagreement exists today about complementarity's importance
and broad applicability in quantum science. Book-length scholarly examinations even provide
speculations about the relevance of complementarity in fields as different from physics as biology,
psychology and social anthropology, connections which were apparently of interest to Bohr himself
(see Jammer [2], Murdoch [3] and Whitaker [4]). Confusion evident in Como following his talk was
not eliminated by Bohr's article [1], and complementarity has been subjected to nine decades of
repeated examination ever since with no agreed resolution. Semi-popular treatments [5] as well
as expert examinations [6-9] show that the topic cannot be avoided, and complementarity retains
its central place in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, recent approaches by our
group [10-13] and others [14-20] to the underlying notion of coherence now allow us to present a universal
formulation of complementarity that may signal the end to the confusion. We demonstrate a new relationship
that constrains the behavior of an electromagnetic field (quantum or classical) in the fundamental
context of two-slit experiments. We show that entanglement is the ingredient needed to complete
Bohr's formulation of complementarity, debated for decades because of its incompleteness.
