We study how photocurrent develops spatially and temporally in noncentrosymmetric systems in
response to a femtosecond light pulse by employing recently developed time-dependent nonequilibrium
Green function algorithms scaling linearly in the number of time steps and capable of treating nonperturbative
effects in the amplitude of external time-dependent fields. The pulse irradiating the middle segment
of a Rice-Mele tight-binding chain of finite length, sandwiched between two normal metal leads,
induces nonequilibrium charge carriers which propagate toward the leads in {\em superballistic}
fashion---signified by time dependence of the displacement $\sim t^\nu$ with $\nu > 1$---in both
clean and disordered chains. When the center frequency $\hbar \Omega$ of the pulse is about half
of the energy gap of the device, non-zero DC component of photocurrent appears in the leads scaling
with the square of the pulse intensity as the signature of {\em two-photon} absorption that was missed
in previous perturbative analyses. For $\hbar \Omega$ larger than the gap, we find {\em one-photon}
absorption with photocurrent linear in intensity. The same, but gapless (i.e., short enough to
allow evanescent wave functions from the leads to fill the gap), device exhibits photocurrent at
all frequencies with its DC component $\propto \Omega^2$ at low $\Omega$, thereby revealing shift
current as a realization of nonadiabatic quantum charge pumping enabled by {\em breaking of left-right
symmetry} of the device structure. This points out to a much wider class of systems, than the usually
considered bulk polar materials, which can be exploited to optimize shift-current-based solar
cells.
