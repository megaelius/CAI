A series of reasons to take quantum unitary evolution seriously and explain the projection of the
state vector as unitary and not discontinuous are presented, including some from General Relativity.
This justifies a reevaluation of the currently accepted limits of unitary evolution and of relativistic
spacetime. I argue that unitary evolution is consistent with both quantum measurements and the
apparent classicality at the macroscopic level. This allows us to take the wavefunction as ontic
(but holistic), but a global consistency condition has to be introduced to ensure this compatibility.
As a consequence, Quantum Theory turns out to be consistent with a definite general relativistic
spacetime, eliminating some of the tensions between the two, usually considered as reasons to quantize
gravity. But the block universe subject to global consistency gains a new flavor, which for an observer
experiencing the flow of time appears as "superdeterministic" or "retrocausal", although this
does not manifest itself in observations in a way which would allow the violation of causality. However,
the block universe view offers another interpretation of this behavior, which removes the tension
with causality. Such a block universe subject to global consistency appears thus as being post-determined.
Here "post-determined" means that for an observer the block universe appears as not being completely
determined from the beginning, but each new quantum observation eliminates some of the possible
block universe solutions consistent with the previous observations. I compare the post-determined
block universe with other views: the evolving present view, the block universe, the splitting block
universe, and the growing block universe, and explain how it combines their major advantages in
a qualitatively different picture.
