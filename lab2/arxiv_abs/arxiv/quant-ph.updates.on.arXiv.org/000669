We propose and analyze a method for the creation, storage and retrieval of optomechanical Schrodinger
cat states, in which there is a quantum superposition of two distinct macroscopic states of a mechanical
oscillator. In the proposal, an optical cat state is first prepared in an optical cavity, then transferred
to the mechanical mode, where it is stored and later retrieved using control fields. We carry out
numerical simulations for the quantum memory protocol for optomechanical cat states using the
positive-P phase space representation. This has a compact, positive representation for a cat state,
thus allowing a probabilistic simulation of this highly non-classical quantum system. To verify
the effectiveness of the cat-state quantum memory, we consider several cat-state signatures and
show how they can be computed. We also investigate the effects of decoherence on a cat state by solving
the standard master equation for a simplified model analytically, allowing us to compare with the
numerical results. Focusing on the negativity of the Wigner function as a signature of the cat state,
we evaluate analytically an upper bound on the time taken for the negativity to vanish, for a given
temperature of the environment of the mechanical oscillator. We show consistency with the numerical
methods. These provide exact solutions, allowing a full treatment of decoherence in an experiment
that involves creating, storing and retrieving mechanical cat states using temporally mode-matched
input and output pulses. Our analysis treats the internal optical and mechanical modes of an optomechanical
oscillator, and the complete set of input and output field modes which become entangled with the
internal modes. The model includes decoherence due to thermal effects in the mechanical reservoirs,
as well as optical and mechanical losses.
