Manipulating quantum computing hardware in the presence of imperfect devices and control systems
is a central challenge in realizing useful quantum computers. Susceptibility to noise limits the
performance and capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as any
future quantum computing technologies. Fortunately quantum control enables efficient execution
of quantum logic operations and algorithms with built-in robustness to errors, without the need
for complex logical encoding. In this manuscript we introduce software tools for the application
and integration of quantum control in quantum computing research, serving the needs of hardware
R&D teams, algorithm developers, and end users. We provide an overview of a set of python-based classical
software tools for creating and deploying optimized quantum control solutions at various layers
of the quantum computing software stack. We describe a software architecture leveraging both high-performance
distributed cloud computation and local custom integration into hardware systems, and explain
how key functionality is integrable with other software packages and quantum programming languages.
Our presentation includes a detailed mathematical overview of central product features including
a flexible optimization toolkit, filter functions for analyzing noise susceptibility in high-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, and new approaches to noise and hardware characterization. Pseudocode is presented
in order to elucidate common programming workflows for these tasks, and performance benchmarking
is reported for numerically intensive tasks, highlighting the benefits of the selected cloud-compute
architecture. Finally, we present a series of case studies demonstrating the application of quantum
control solutions using these tools in real experimental settings for both trapped-ion and superconducting
quantum computer hardware.
