Boltzmann Machines constitute a class of neural networks with applications to image reconstruction,
pattern classification and unsupervised learning in general. Their most common variants, called
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) exhibit a good trade-off between computability on existing
silicon-based hardware and generality of possible applications. Still, the diffusion of RBMs
is quite limited, since their training process proves to be hard. The advent of commercial Adiabatic
Quantum Computers (AQCs) raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum
devices could increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. To date, however,
the implementation of RBM networks on AQCs has been limited by the low qubit connectivity when each
qubit acts as a node of the neural network. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a complete RBM on
AQCs, thanks to an embedding that associates its nodes to virtual qubits, thus outperforming previous
implementations based on incomplete graphs. Moreover, to accelerate the learning, we implement
a semantic quantum search which, contrary to previous proposals, takes the input data as initial
boundary conditions to start each learning step of the RBM, thanks to a reverse annealing schedule.
Such an approach, unlike the more conventional forward annealing schedule, allows sampling configurations
in a meaningful neighborhood of the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs
sampling algorithm. We show that the learning based on reverse annealing quickly raises the sampling
probability of a meaningful subset of the set of the configurations. Even without a proper optimization
of the annealing schedule, the RBM semantically trained by reverse annealing achieves better scores
on reconstruction tasks.
