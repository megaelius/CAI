Quantum annealing is a powerful alternative model for quantum computing, which can succeed in the
presence of environmental noise even without error correction. However, despite great effort,
no conclusive proof of a quantum speedup (relative to state of the art classical algorithms) has
been shown for these systems, and rigorous theoretical proofs of a quantum advantage generally
rely on exponential precision in at least some aspects of the system, an unphysical resource guaranteed
to be scrambled by random noise. In this work, we propose a new variant of quantum annealing, called
RFQA, which can maintain a scalable quantum speedup in the face of noise and modest control precision.
Specifically, we consider a modification of flux qubit-based quantum annealing which includes
random, but coherent, low-frequency oscillations in the directions of the transverse field terms
as the system evolves. We show that this method produces a quantum speedup for finding ground states
in the Grover problem and quantum random energy model, and thus should be widely applicable to other
hard optimization problems which can be formulated as quantum spin glasses. Further, we show that
this speedup should be resilient to two realistic noise channels ($1/f$-like local potential fluctuations
and local heating from interaction with a finite temperature bath), and that another noise channel,
bath-assisted quantum phase transitions, actually accelerates the algorithm and may outweigh
the negative effects of the others. The modifications we consider have a straightforward experimental
implementation and could be explored with current technology.
