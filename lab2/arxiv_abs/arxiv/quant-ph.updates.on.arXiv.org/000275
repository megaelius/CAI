The reconstruction of the state of a multipartite quantum mechanical system represents a fundamental
task in quantum information science. At its most basic, it concerns a state of a bipartite quantum
system whose subsystems are subjected to local operations. We compare two different methods for
obtaining the original state from the state resulting from the action of these operations. The first
method involves quantum operations called Petz recovery maps, acting locally on the two subsystems.
The second method is called matrix (or state) reconstruction and involves local, linear maps which
are not necessarily completely positive. Moreover, we compare the quantities on which the maps
employed in the two methods depend. We show that any state which admits Petz recovery also admits
state reconstruction. However, the latter is successful for a strictly larger set of states. We
also compare these methods in the context of a finite spin chain. Here, the state of a finite spin chain
is reconstructed from the reduced states of a few neighbouring spins. In this setting, state reconstruction
is the same as the MPO (i.e. matrix product operator) reconstruction proposed by Baumgratz et al.
in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 020401 (2013)]. Finally, we generalize both these methods so that they
employ long-range measurements instead of relying solely on short-range correlations embodied
in such local reduced states. Long-range measurements enable the reconstruction of states which
cannot be reconstructed from measurements of local few-body observables alone and hereby we improve
existing methods for quantum state tomography of quantum many-body systems.
