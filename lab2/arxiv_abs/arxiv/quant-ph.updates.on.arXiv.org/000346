We develop an improved variant of $U(1)$-symmetric infinite projected entangled-pair states
(iPEPS) ansatz to investigate the ground state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ square $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$
Heisenberg model. In order to improve the accuracy of the ansatz, we discuss a simple strategy to
select automatically relevant symmetric sectors and also introduce an optimization method to
treat second-neighbor interactions more efficiently. We show that variational ground-state
energies of the model obtained by the $U(1)$-symmetric iPEPS ansatz (for a fixed bond dimension
$D$) set a better upper bound, improving previous tensor-network-based results. By studying N\'{e}el
order parameter and correlation function in the large-$D$ limit, we find that a deconfined quantum-critical
point occurs at $J^{c_1}_{2}=0.530(5)$, where the correlation length of the system diverges as
$\xi \sim D^{1.2}$. The estimated critical anomalous exponents $\eta_{s}=0.65(5)$ and $\eta_{d}=1.9(1)$
for spin and dimer correlations respectively show strong deviation from those of the well-known
$\mathcal{J}$-$\mathcal{Q}$ model, suggesting possibly a different universality class. The
pattern of local bond energy for the intermediate phase is compatible with the columnar valence
bond solid (VBS) state, with a quite competitive variational ground-state energy in comparison
with plaquette VBS one predicted by the density matrix renormalization group. We show that the associated
VBS order parameter first monotonically increases with $J_2$ and finally a first-order quantum
phase transition takes place at $J^{c_2}_{2}=0.610(3)$ to the conventional Stripe phase. We compare
our results with earlier DMRG and PEPS studies and suggest future directions for resolving remaining
issues.
