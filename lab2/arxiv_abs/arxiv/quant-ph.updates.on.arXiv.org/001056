We study the preparation of coherent quantum states via a two-photon micromaser for applications
in quantum metrology. While this setting can be in principle realized in a host of physical systems,
we focus here on a situations where atoms interact with the electric field of a cavity through the
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. We show that for achieving the desired two-photon micromaser dynamics
the conventional approach of considering atoms with three relevant states and coupling them in
two-photon resonance to the cavity field is not sufficient. Instead, additional levels are required
in order to cancel emerging Starks shifts in leading order. Once this is accomplished the dynamics
of the cavity is described by a discrete dissipative map that features a degenerate stationary state
manifold of pure states. We derive the analytic form of these states, and show that they include Schr\"odinger
cat states. In order to analyze the usefulness of these states for phase estimation protocols we
analyze the quantum Fisher information in the transient as well as the stationarity regime and find
that it exceeds the standard quantum limit. To account for realistic imperfections, we consider
single-photon losses from the cavity and higher-order corrections in the far-detuned limit, which
result in metastability of formerly stationary cavity states, and long-time dynamics with a unique
mixed stationary state. Despite being mixed, this stationary state can still feature quantum Fisher
information that exceeds the standard quantum limit. Our work delivers a comprehensive overview
of the highly intricate dynamics of two-photon micromasers with particular focus on phase estimation.
While the focus of the current work is on a physical realization of this setup with atoms coupled to
a cavity, the results can be directly translated to optomechanical systems.
