We address the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord for two non interacting qubits initially
prepared in a maximally entangled state and then subjected to a classical colored noise, i.e. coupled
with an external environment characterized by a noise spectrum of the form $1/f^{\alpha}$. More
specifically, we address systems where the Gaussian approximation fails, i.e. the sole knowledge
of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of quantum correlations. We thus investigate
the dynamics for two different configurations of the environment: in the first case the noise spectrum
is due to the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an undetermined switching
rate, whereas in the second case we consider a collection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching
rates. In both cases we found analytical expressions for the time dependence of entanglement and
quantum discord, which may be also extended to a collection of flcutuators with random switching
rates. The environmental noise is introduced by means of stochastic time-dependent terms in the
Hamiltonian and this allows us to describe the effects of both separate and common environments.
We show that the non-Gaussian character of the noise may lead to significant effects, e.g. environments
with the same power spectrum, but different configurations, give raise to opposite behavior for
the quantum correlations. In particular, depending on the characteristics of the environmental
noise considered, both entanglement and discord display either a monotonic decay or the phenomena
of sudden death and revivals. Our results show that the microscopic structure of environment, besides
its noise spectrum, is relevant for the dynamics of quantum correlations, and may be a valid starting
point for the engineering of non-Gaussian colored environments.
