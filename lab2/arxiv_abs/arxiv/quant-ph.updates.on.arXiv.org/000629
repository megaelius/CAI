Phononic resonators play important roles in settings that range from gravitational wave detectors
to cellular telephones. They serve as high-performance transducers, sensors, and filters by offering
low dissipation, tunable coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a wide range
of frequencies, materials, and fabrication processes. Systems of phononic resonators typically
obey reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon transmission coefficient between any two resonators
is independent of the direction of transmission. Reciprocity must be broken to realize devices
(such as isolators and circulators) that provide one-way propagation of acoustic energy between
resonators. Such devices are crucial for protecting active elements, mitigating noise, and operating
full-duplex transceivers. To date, nonreciprocal phononic devices have not combined the features
necessary for robust operation: strong nonreciprocity, in situ tunability, compact integration,
and continuous operation. Furthermore, they have been applied only to coherent signals (rather
than fluctuations or noise), and have been realized exclusively in travelling-wave systems (rather
than resonators). Here we describe a cavity optomechanical scheme that produces robust nonreciprocal
coupling between phononic resonators. This scheme provides ~ 30 dB of isolation and can be tuned
in situ simply via the phases of the drive tones applied to the cavity. In addition, by directly monitoring
the resonators' dynamics we show that this nonreciprocity can be used to control thermal fluctuations,
and that this control represents a new resource for cooling phononic resonators.
