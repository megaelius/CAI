Penrose has been advocating the view that the collapse of the wave function is rooted in the incompatibility
between general relativity and quantum mechanics. Asserting that gravity wins, he arrived on basis
of dimensional analysis at an estimate for the collapse time. This is an ad-hoc affair and here we
will present an analysis revolving around the explicit role of time in gravitational wave function
collapse. We present a thought experiment, in which we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical
clock containing a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clocking action comes
from a single strong laser pulse traveling in an optical cavity. At its center it contains a massive
object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of space time into the problem. We find that
a state of this massive object with a smaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger
time delay. Considering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, this suffers from
an ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states. We assert that this time ambiguity
will affect the relative phase and that the wave function collapse will occur when this extra phase
becomes of order unity. An absolute energy scale enters this equation and we recover Penrose's estimate
for the collapse time when we set this equal to the rest mass of the object. This sheds light on the counterintuitive
aspect of Penrose's claim that gravitational time dilation effects can play any role dealing with
masses of order of micrograms: the rest mass is sufficiently large such that the tiny time differences
can confuse the unitary time evolution.
