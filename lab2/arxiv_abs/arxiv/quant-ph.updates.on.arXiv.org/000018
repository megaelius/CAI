In the context of experimental tests of Bell inequalities, the role of supplementary assumptions
is not sufficiently acknowledged. In this paper we extend an already well known local hidden variables
(LHV) model for the bipartite correlations in the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality to account
for the probabilities of detection when the polarizers are removed. The modified model is a clear
example that the phenomenom of "detection probability enhancement" (ENH), a breach of the no-enhancement
hypothesis, is enough to explain the violation of the non-genuine version of the CH inequality (so
far the one that can be experimentally tested, at least in what concerns photon-based tests). Beyond
this particular example, the existence of an LHV model based on ENH and satisfying all quantum predictions
for a given state and (bipartite) set of observables is always guaranteed for any value $\eta \leq
\tfrac{1}{2}$ of the relative detection rate (usually known as detection efficiency), though
models may also exist for higher values of $\eta$. According to this work, therefore, accepted values
of "critical efficiencies" should be revised to consider the occurrence of ENH; however, our results
also seem to suggest that for a possible validation of non-genuine tests, even with the occurence
of ENH, it may be enough to demand compliance with the complete set of quantum predictions for the
given state and observables. Our (non-exhaustive) numerical simulations confirm this in the case
of maximal entanglement; it is yet to be seen if it also applies to tests making use of non-maximally
entangled states. Finally, the plausibility of ENH is also strongly suggested by what we call "the
Wigner-PDC picture of photon entanglement".
