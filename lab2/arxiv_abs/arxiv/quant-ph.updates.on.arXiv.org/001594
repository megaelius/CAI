In magnetism, skyrmions correspond to classical spin textures that are formed in a system as the
result of competing magnetic interactions. Such non-trivial magnetic textures can be observed
in actual materials using spin-polarized scanning tunneling and Lorentz microscopy, or in x-ray
and neutron scattering experiments. Theoretically, skyrmion spin textures are usually obtained
as the solution of a continuous micromagnetic model, or of an equivalent classical spin lattice
problem, and they are characterized by a topological invariant that counts how many times the spins
wrap around the sphere. The typical distance over which spins wind can a priori be made very small
by reducing direct exchange interaction, leading to the concept of nanoskyrmions, with tremendous
potential applications for memory storage. However, by the time spins wind over a few lattice spacings
only, a continuous approximation is no longer appropriate, and quantum effects cannot be ignored.
The very concept of a skyrmion is in fact not obvious for quantum spins since the orientation of a spin
is in general ill-defined -- the three components of a quantum spin cannot be measured simultaneously
-- and the characterization of the quantum version of skyrmion textures calls for new ideas. In this
work we argue that the classical skyrmion can be considered as the result of a single measurement
of a more general quantum skyrmion state. We show that this novel quantum state is well defined even
for the ultra-quantum case of spins-1/2. For a full characterization of the quantum skyrmion we
introduce a special correlation function of three spin operators -- the quantum scalar chirality.
We find that this quantity is nearly constant in the quantum skyrmion state, and can be proposed as
a quantum version of the classical skyrmion number.
