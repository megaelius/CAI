Methods for electronic structure based on Gaussian and molecular orbital discretizations offer
a well established, compact representation that forms much of the foundation of correlated quantum
chemistry calculations on both classical and quantum computers. Despite their ability to describe
essential physics with relatively few basis functions, these representations can suffer from
a quartic growth of the number of integrals. Recent results have shown that, for some quantum and
classical algorithms, moving to representations with diagonal two-body operators can result
in dramatically lower asymptotic costs, even if the number of functions required increases significantly.
We introduce a way to interpolate between the two regimes in a systematic and controllable manner,
such that the number of functions is minimized while maintaining a block diagonal structure of the
two-body operator and desirable properties of an original, primitive basis. Techniques are analyzed
for leveraging the structure of this new representation on quantum computers. Empirical results
for hydrogen chains suggest a scaling improvement from $O(N^{4.5})$ in molecular orbital representations
to $O(N^{2.6})$ in our representation for quantum evolution in a fault-tolerant setting, and exhibit
a constant factor crossover at 15 to 20 atoms. Moreover, we test these methods using modern density
matrix renormalization group methods classically, and achieve excellent accuracy with respect
to the complete basis set limit with a speedup of 1-2 orders of magnitude with respect to using the
primitive or Gaussian basis sets alone. These results suggest our representation provides significant
cost reductions while maintaining accuracy relative to molecular orbital or strictly diagonal
approaches for modest-sized systems in both classical and quantum computation for correlated
systems.
