Bohm developed an ansatz to transform the Schr\"odinger equation into two differential equations.
One of them is a continuity equation related to the conservation of the number of particles, and the
other is an equation of motion similar to the Newtonian equation of motion. This ansatz for the analysis
of quantum mechanics is called Bohmian mechanics (BM). These two differential equations of BM can
be derived both for single-particle systems and for many-particle systems and depend on the complete
set of particle coordinates of the system. Later, Kuzmenkov and Maksimov used basic quantum mechanics
for the derivation of many-particle quantum hydrodynamics (MPQHD) including the derivation of
three differential equations: One equation for the mass balance and two differential equations
for the momentum balance. In a prework [K. Renziehausen, I. Barth, Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2018,
013A05 (2018)], we extended this analysis by the case that the particle ensemble consists of different
sorts of particles. For such a system, a version for each of the above-mentioned three differential
equations of MPQHD can be found both for each individual particle sort and for the total particle
ensemble. All these differential equations of MPQHD only depend on a single position vector. The
purpose of this paper is to show how the equations mentioned above, which are related to either BM
or MPQHD, are connected with each other -- therefore, we prove how all the above-mentioned differential
equations of MPQHD can be derived when we use the two above-mentioned differential equations of
BM as a starting point. Moreover, our discussion clarifies that the differential equations of MPQHD
are more suitable for an analysis of many-particle systems than the differential equations of BM
because they depend only a single position vector and not on the complete set of particle coordinates
of the system.
