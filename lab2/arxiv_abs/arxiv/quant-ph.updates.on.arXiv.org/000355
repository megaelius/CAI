Highly sensitive nuclear spin detection is crucial in many scientific areas including nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), imaging (MRI) and quantum computing. The tiny thermal
nuclear spin polarization represents a major obstacle towards this goal which may be overcome by
Dynamic Nuclear Spin Polarization (DNP) methods. The latter often rely on the transfer of the thermally
polarized electron spins to nearby nuclear spins, which is limited by the Boltzmann distribution
of the former. Here we demonstrate the polarization and read out of a nuclear spin bath consisting
of $^{13}$C nuclear spins in diamond by using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Our method
utilizes microwave dressed states to transfer the NV's high ($>$~92~\%) non-equilibrium electron
spin polarization induced by short laser pulses to the surrounding carbon nuclear spins, where
the NV is repeatedly repolarized optically, thus providing an effectively infinite polarization
reservoir. A saturation of the polarization in the nuclear "frozen core" is achieved, which is confirmed
by the decay of the polarization transfer signal and shows an excellent agreement with theoretical
simulations. Hereby we introduce the Polarization Read Out by Polarization Inversion (PROPI)
method as a quantitative magnetization measure of the nuclear spin bath. Moreover, we show that
using the integrated solid effect both for single and double quantum transitions a nuclear spin
polarization can be achieved even when the static magnetic field is not aligned along the NV's crystal
axis. This opens a path for the application of our DNP technique to spins in and outside of nanodiamonds,
enabling their application as MRI tracers.
