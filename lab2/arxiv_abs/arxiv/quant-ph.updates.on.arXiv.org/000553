Thermodynamic properties of Robin quantum well with extrapolation length $\Lambda$ are analyzed
theoretically both for canonical and two grand canonical ensembles with special attention being
paid to situation when energies of one or two lowest-lying states are split-off from rest of spectrum
by large gap that is controlled by varying $\Lambda$. For single split-off level, which exists for
the geometry with equal magnitudes but opposite signs of Robin distances on confining interfaces,
heat capacity $c_V$ of canonical averaging is a nonmonotonic function of temperature $T$ with its
salient maximum growing to infinity as $\ln^2\Lambda$ for decreasing to zero extrapolation length
and its position being proportional to $1/(\Lambda^2\ln\Lambda)$. Specific heat per particle
$c_N$ of Fermi-Dirac ensemble depends nonmonotonically on temperature too with its pronounced
extremum being foregone on $T$ axis by plateau whose value at dying $\Lambda$ is $(N-1)/(2N)k_B$,
with $N$ being a number of fermions. Maximum of $c_N$, similar to canonical averaging, unrestrictedly
increases as $\Lambda$ goes to zero and is the largest for one particle. Most essential property
of Bose-Einstein ensemble is a formation, for growing number of bosons, of sharp asymmetric shape
on the $c_N-T$ characteristics that is more protrusive at the smaller Robin distances. This cusp-like
structure is a manifestation of the phase transition to the condensate state. For two split-off
orbitals, one additional maximum emerges whose position is shifted to colder temperatures with
increase of energy gap between these two states and their higher-lying counterparts and whose magnitude
approaches $\Lambda$-independent value. All these physical phenomena are qualitatively and
quantitatively explained by variation of energy spectrum by Robin distance.
