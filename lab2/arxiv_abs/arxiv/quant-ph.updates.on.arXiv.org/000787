Thermodynamics and information have intricate interrelations. Often thermodynamics is considered
to be the logical premise to justify that information is physical - through Landauer's principle
-, thereby also linking information and thermodynamics. This approach towards information has
been instrumental to understand thermodynamics of logical and physical processes, both in the
classical and quantum domain. In the present work, we formulate thermodynamics as an exclusive
consequence of information conservation. The framework can be applied to the most general situations,
beyond the traditional assumptions in thermodynamics: we allow systems and thermal baths to be
quantum, of arbitrary sizes and possessing inter-system correlations. Here, systems and baths
are not treated differently, rather both are considered on an equal footing. This leads us to introduce
a "temperature"-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We rely on the fact that, for a fixed
amount of information, measured by the von Neumann entropy, any system can be transformed to a state
with the same entropy that possesses minimal energy. This state, known as a completely passive state,
acquires Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical form with an intrinsic temperature. We introduce the notions
of bound and free energy and use them to quantify heat and work, respectively. Guided by the principle
of information conservation, we develop universal notions of equilibrium, heat and work, Landauer's
principle and universal fundamental laws of thermodynamics. We demonstrate that the maximum efficiency
of a quantum engine with a finite bath is in general lower than that of an ideal Carnot engine. We introduce
a resource theoretic framework for our intrinsic temperature based thermodynamics, within which
we address the problem of work extraction and state transformations. Finally, the framework is
extended to multiple conserved quantities.
