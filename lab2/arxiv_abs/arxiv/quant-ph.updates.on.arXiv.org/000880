We study the population dynamics in a two-atom setup in which each atom is independently driven by
different light fields, but coupling the same Rydberg state. In particular, we look at how an offset
in the Rabi frequencies between two atoms influences the dynamics. We find novel features such as
amplifying the Rabi frequency of one atom, together with strong Rydberg-Rydberg interactions
freezes the dynamics in the second atom. We characterize the Rydberg-biased freezing phenomenon
in detail, with effective Hamiltonians obtained for different limits of system parameters using
Schrieffer-Wolf transformation. In the absence of Rabi-offset, the doubly excited state population
exhibits a Lorentzian profile as a function of interaction, whereas for very small offsets it shows
splitting and thus peaks. Using an effective Hamiltonian as well as the perturbation theory for
weak interactions, we show that the peak arises from a competition between Rabi-offset and Rydberg-Rydberg
interactions when both are sufficiently small, together with the Rydberg blockade at large interactions.
The effective Hamiltonians provide us with analytical results which are in an excellent agreement
with full numerical solutions. Also, we analyze the growth and the dynamics of quantum correlations
such as entanglement entropy and quantum discord for the coherent dynamics. We extend our studies
to the dissipative case in which the spontaneous emission from the Rydberg state is taken into account
and in particular, we look at the purity and quantum discord in the steady states. To conclude, our
studies reveal that the local manipulation of an atom using Rabi-offset can be an ideal tool to control
the quantum correlations and in general, quantum states of the composite two-qubit systems.
