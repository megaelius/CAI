Frequency conversion (FC) and type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) processes serve as basic
building blocks for the implementation of quantum optical experiments: type-II PDC enables the
efficient creation of quantum states such as photon-number states and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-states
(EPR-states). FC gives rise to technologies enabling efficient atom-photon coupling, ultrafast
pulse gates and enhanced detection schemes. However, despite their widespread deployment, their
theoretical treatment remains challenging. Especially the multi-photon components in the high-gain
regime as well as the explicit time-dependence of the involved Hamiltonians hamper an efficient
theoretical description of these nonlinear optical processes. In this paper, we investigate these
effects and put forward two models that enable a full description of FC and type-II PDC in the high-gain
regime. We present a rigorous numerical model relying on the solution of coupled integro-differential
equations that covers the complete dynamics of the process. As an alternative, we develop a simplified
model that, at the expense of neglecting time-ordering effects, enables an analytical solution.
While the simplified model approximates the correct solution with high fidelity in a broad parameter
range, sufficient for many experimental situations, such as FC with low efficiency, entangled
photon-pair generation and the heralding of single photons from type-II PDC, our investigations
reveal that the rigorous model predicts a decreased performance for FC processes in quantum pulse
gate applications and an enhanced EPR-state generation rate during type-II PDC, when EPR squeezing
values above 12 dB are considered.
