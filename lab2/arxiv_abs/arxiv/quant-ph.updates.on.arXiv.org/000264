The synthesis of quantum and gravitational physics is sought through a finite, realistic, locally
causal theory where gravity plays a vital role not only during decoherent measurement but also during
non-decoherent unitary evolution. Invariant set theory is built on geometric properties of a compact
fractal-like subset $I_U$ of cosmological state space on which the universe is assumed to evolve
and from which the laws of physics are assumed to derive. Consistent with the primacy of $I_U$, a non-Euclidean
(and hence non-classical) state-space metric $g_p$ is defined, related to the $p$-adic metric
of number theory where $p$ is a large but finite Pythagorean prime. Uncertain states on $I_U$ are
described using complex Hilbert states, but only if their squared amplitudes are rational and corresponding
complex phase angles are rational multiples of $2 \pi$. Such Hilbert states are necessarily $g_p$-distant
from states with either irrational squared amplitudes or irrational phase angles. The gappy fractal
nature of $I_U$ accounts for quantum complementarity and is characterised numerically by a generic
number-theoretic incommensurateness between rational angles and rational cosines of angles.
The Bell inequality, whose violation would be inconsistent with local realism, is shown to be $g_p$-distant
from all forms of the inequality that are violated in any finite-precision experiment. The delayed-choice
paradox is resolved through the computational irreducibility of $I_U$. The Schr\"odinger and
Dirac equations describe evolution on $I_U$ in the singular limit at $p=\infty$. By contrast, an
extension of the Einstein field equations on $I_U$ is proposed which reduces smoothly to general
relativity as $p \rightarrow \infty$. Novel proposals for the dark universe and the elimination
of classical space-time singularities are given and experimental implications outlined.
