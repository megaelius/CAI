Causality never gained the status of a "law" or "principle" in physics. Some recent literature even
popularized the false idea that causality is a notion that should be banned from theory. Such misconception
relies on an alleged universality of reversibility of laws of physics, based either on determinism
of classical theory, or on the multiverse interpretation of quantum theory, in both cases motivated
by mere interpretational requirements for realism of the theory. Here, I will show that a properly
defined unambiguous notion of causality is a theorem of quantum theory, which is also a falsifiable
proposition of the theory. Such causality notion appeared in the literature within the framework
of operational probabilistic theories. It is a genuinely theoretical notion, corresponding to
establish a definite partial order among events, in the same way as we do by using the future causal
cone on Minkowski space. The causality notion is logically completely independent of the misidentified
concept of "determinism", and, being a consequence of quantum theory, is ubiquitous in physics.
In addition, as classical theory can be regarded as a restriction of quantum theory, causality holds
also in the classical case, although the determinism of the theory trivializes it. I then conclude
arguing that causality naturally establishes an arrow of time. This implies that the scenario of
the "Block Universe" and the connected "Past Hypothesis" are incompatible with causality, and
thus with quantum theory: they both are doomed to remain mere interpretations and, as such, not falsifiable,
similar to the hypothesis of "super-determinism". This article is part of a discussion meeting
issue "Foundations of quantum mechanics and their impact on contemporary society".
