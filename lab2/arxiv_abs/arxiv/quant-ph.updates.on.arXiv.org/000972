Recently, there are tremendous developments on the number of controllable qubits in several quantum
computing systems. For these implementations, it is crucial to determine the entanglement structure
of the prepared multipartite quantum state as a basis for further information processing tasks.
In reality, evaluation of a multipartite state is in general a very challenging task owing to the
exponential increase of the Hilbert space with respect to the number of system components. In this
work, we propose a systematic method using very few local measurements to detect multipartite entanglement
structures based on the graph state --- one of the most important classes of quantum states for quantum
information processing. Thanks to the close connection between the Schmidt coefficient and quantum
entropy in graph states, we develop a family of efficient witness operators to detect the entanglement
between subsystems under any partitions and hence the entanglement intactness. We show that the
number of local measurements equals to the chromatic number of the underlying graph, which is a constant
number, independent of the number of qubits. In reality, the optimization problem involved in the
witnesses can be challenging with large system size. For several widely-used graph states, such
as 1-D and 2-D cluster states and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, by taking advantage of
the area law of entanglement entropy, we derive analytical solutions for the witnesses, which only
employ two local measurements. Our method offers a standard tool for entanglement structure detection
to benchmark multipartite quantum systems.
