Recently de Palma et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63, 728 (2017)] proved---using Lagrange multiplier
techniques---that under a non-zero input entropy constraint, a thermal state input minimizes
the output entropy of a pure-loss bosonic channel. In this note, we present our attempt to generalize
this result to all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by using similar techniques.
Unlike the case of the pure-loss channel, we cannot prove that the thermal input state is the only
local extremum of the optimization problem. %It is unclear to us why the same techniques do not lead
to a proof for amplifier channels. However, we do prove that, if the conjecture holds for gauge-covariant
Gaussian channels, it would also hold for gauge-contravariant Gaussian channels. The truth of
the latter leads to a solution of the triple trade-off and broadcast capacities of quantum-limited
amplifier channels. We note that de Palma et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 160503 (2017)] have now proven
the conjecture for all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by employing a different
approach from what we outline here. Proving a multi-mode generalization of de Palma et al.'s above
mentioned result---i.e., given a lower bound on the von Neumann entropy of the input to an $n$-mode
lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, an $n$-mode product thermal state input minimizes the output
entropy---will establish an important special case of the conjectured Entropy Photon-number
Inequality (EPnI). The EPnI, if proven true, would take on a role analogous to Shannon's EPI in proving
coding theorem converses involving quantum limits of classical communication over bosonic channels.
