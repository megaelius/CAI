The entanglement structure between different frequency components within broadband quantum
light pulses, forged at entanglement creation, represents a promising route to the practical delivery
of many multipartite quantum information applications. However, the scalability of such applications
is largely limited by the entanglement decoherence caused by photon loss. One promising method
to combat such losses is noiseless linear amplification. However, while there have been various
procedures that implement noiseless linear amplification on single-mode states, no realization
has thus far been proposed for noiseless linear amplification on quantum states carrying a multimode
structure. In this work we close this gap, proposing a novel Noiseless Linear Amplifier (NLA) with
Photon Catalysis (PC), namely, the PC-NLA. Constructing a multimode version of an existing NLA
that uses Quantum Scissors (QS), the QS-NLA, we then show how the PC-NLA is compatible with the QS-NLA,
even though the former uses half the physical resources of the latter. We then apply our newly developed
multimode NLA frameworks to the problem of Continuous-Variable (CV) entanglement distillation,
determining how the multimode structure of the entanglement impacts the performance of the NLAs.
Different from single-mode NLA analyses, we find that a multimode NLA is only effective as a CV entanglement
distillation strategy when the channel loss is beyond some threshold - a threshold largely dependent
on the multimode structure. The results provided here will be valuable for real-world implementations
of multipartite quantum information applications that utilize complex entanglement structure
within broadband light pulses.
