The notion of contextuality, which emerges from a theorem established by Simon Kochen and Ernst
Specker (1960-1967) and by John Bell (1964-1966), is certainly one of the most fundamental aspects
of quantum weirdness. If it is a questioning on scholastic philosophy and a study of contrafactual
logic that led Specker to his demonstration with Kochen, it was a criticism of von Neumann's "proof"
that led John Bell to the result. A misinterpretation of this famous "proof" will lead them to diametrically
opposite conclusions. Over the last decades, remarkable theoretical progresses have been made
on the subject in the context of the study of quantum foundations and quantum information. Thus,
the graphic generalizations of Cabello-Severini-Winter and Acin-Fritz-Leverrier-Sainz raise
the question of the connection between non-locality and contextuality. It is also the case of the
sheaf-theoretic approach of Samson Abramsky et al., which also invites us to compare contextuality
with the logical structure of certain classical logical paradoxes. Another approach, initiated
by Robert Spekkens, generalizes the concept to any type of experimental procedure. This new form
of "universal" contextuality has been raised as a criterion of non-classicality, i.e. of weirdness.
It notably led to identify the nature of curious quantum paradoxes involving post-selections and
weak measurements. In the light of the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the Kochen-Specker
theorem, this report aims to introduce these results little known to the French scientific public,
in the context of an investigation on the nature of the weirdness of quantum physics.
