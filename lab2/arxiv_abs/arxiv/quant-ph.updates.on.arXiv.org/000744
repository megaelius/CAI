The ability to achieve ultra-strong coupling between light and matter promises to bring about new
means to control material properties, new concepts for manipulating light at the atomic scale,
and fundamentally new insights into quantum electrodynamics (QED). Thus, there is a need to develop
quantitative theories of QED phenomena in complex electronic and photonic systems. In this Letter,
we develop a variational theory of general non-relativistic QED systems of coupled light and matter.
Essential to our ansatz is the notion of an effective photonic vacuum whose modes are different than
the modes in the absence of light-matter coupling. This variational formulation leads to a set of
general equations that can describe the ground state of multi-electron systems coupled to many
photonic modes in real space. As a first step towards a new ab initio approach to ground and excited
state energies in QED, we apply our ansatz to describe a multi-level emitter coupled to many optical
modes, a system with no analytical solution. We find a compact semi-analytical formula which describes
ground and excited state energies to less than 1% error in all regimes of coupling parameters allowed
by sum rules. Additionally, our formulation provides essentially a non-perturbative theory of
Lamb shifts and Casimir-Polder forces, as well as suggesting new physical concepts such as the Casimir
energy of a single atom in a cavity. Our method should give rise to highly accurate descriptions of
phenomena in general QED systems, such as Casimir forces, Lamb shifts, spontaneous emission, and
other fluctuational electrodynamical effects.
