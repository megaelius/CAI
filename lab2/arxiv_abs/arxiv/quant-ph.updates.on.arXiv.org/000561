The Schrodinger variational approach (1926) to quantization of the natural Hamilton mechanics
in $2n$-dimensional phase space is revised in the modern paradigm of quantum mechanics in application
to the system the Hamilton function of which is a positive-definite quadratic form of the n momenta
with the coefficients depending on coordinates in the generic configuration space $V_n$. The quantum
Hamilonian thus obtained has a paradoxical potential term depending on choice of coordinates in
$V_n$, which was discovered first by B. DeWitt in 1952 in the framework of canonical quantization
of the system by a particular ordering of the operators of observables of momenta and coordinates.
It is shown that the Schrodinger approach in the standard paradigm of quantum mechanics determines
uniquely the ordering selected by DeWitt among a continuum of other possibilties to determine the
quantum Hamiltonian. Two particular classes of observables of localization in $V_n$ are considered
in detail. It is shown that, in general, the quantum-mechanical potential does not vanish even in
the Euclidean configuration space $V_n$ except the case when Cartesian coordinates are taken as
the observables of localization of the system. It is noted also that, in the quasi-classical approach
to the quantization considered by DeWitt in 1957, the quantum Green function (propagator) is also
non-unique and depends on the choice of a line in $V_n$ connecting these points. All three formalisms
have the same local asymtotics of the quantum Hamiltonian if the normal Riemannian cordinates are
used, at least implicitly, to localize the system in $V_n$. Keywords: Hamilton function; Quantization;
