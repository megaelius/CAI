Quantum physics, which describes the strange behavior of light and matter at the smallest scales,
is one of the most successful descriptions of reality, yet it is notoriously inaccessible. Here
we provide an approachable explanation of quantum physics using simple thought experiments. We
derive all relevant quantum predictions using minimal mathematics, without introducing the advanced
calculations that are typically used to describe quantum physics. We focus on the two key surprises
of quantum physics, namely wave-particle duality, a term that was introduced to capture the fact
that single quantum particles in some respects behave like waves and in other respects like particles,
and entanglement, which applies to two or more quantum particles and brings out the inherent contradiction
between quantum physics and seemingly obvious assumptions regarding the nature of reality. Following
arguments originally made by John Bell and Lucien Hardy, we show that the so-called local hidden
variables are inadequate at explaining the behavior of entangled quantum particles. This means
that one either has to give up on hidden variables, i.e., the idea that the outcomes of measurements
on quantum particles are determined before an experiment is actually carried out, or one has to relinquish
the principle of locality, which requires that no causal influences should be faster than the speed
of light and is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of relativity. Finally, we describe how these
remarkable predictions of quantum physics have been confirmed in experiments. We have successfully
used the present approach in a course that is open to all undergraduate students at the University
of Calgary, without any prerequisites in mathematics or physics.
