The coherent states that describe the classical motion of a mechanical oscillator do not have well-defined
energy, but are rather quantum superpositions of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing
this quantized structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures the mechanical energy
with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon, $\hbar\omega_\text{m}$. One way to
achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator
and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish
different phonon number states by resolvable differences in the atom's transition frequency.
Such dispersive measurements have been studied in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics
where experiments using real and artificial atoms have resolved the photon number states of cavities.
Here, we report an experiment where an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a driven nanomechanical
oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the quantization of its energy. To realize this,
we build a hybrid platform that integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave
superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses of varying amplitude
and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency
shifts $\approx 5$ times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated
platform for quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence times,
and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure. With modest experimental improvements,
we expect our approach will make quantum nondemolition measurements of phonons an experimental
reality, leading the way to new quantum sensors and information processing approaches that use
chip-scale nanomechanical devices.
