We consider spaces of trial wavefunctions for ground states and edge excitations in the fractional
quantum Hall effect that can be obtained in various ways. In one way, functions are obtained by analyzing
the entanglement of the ground state wavefunction, partitioned into two parts. In another, functions
are defined by the way in which they vanish as several coordinates approach the same value, or by a
projection-operator Hamiltonian that enforces those conditions. In a third way, functions are
given by conformal blocks from a conformal field theory (CFT). These different spaces of functions
are closely related. The use of CFT methods permits an algebraic formulation to be given for all of
them. In some cases, we can prove that there is a ground state, a Hamiltonian, and a CFT such that, for
any number of particles, all of these spaces are the same. For such cases, this resolves several questions
and conjectures: it gives a finite-size bulk-edge correspondence, and we can use the analysis of
functions to construct a projection-operator Hamiltonian that produces those functions as zero-energy
states. For a model related to the N=1 superconformal algebra, the corresponding Hamiltonian imposes
vanishing properties involving only three particles; for this we determine all the wavefunctions
explicitly. We do the same for a sequence of models involving the M(3,p) Virasoro minimal models
that has been considered previously, using results from the literature. We exhibit the Hamiltonians
for the first few cases of these. The techniques we introduce can be applied in numerous examples
other than those considered here.
