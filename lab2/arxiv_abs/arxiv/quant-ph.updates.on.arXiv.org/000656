The Jordan structure of finite-dimensional quantum theory is derived, in a conspicuously easy
way, from a few simple postulates concerning abstract probabilistic models (each defined by a set
of basic measurements and a convex set of states). The key assumption is that each system A can be paired
with an isomorphic $\textit{conjugate}$ system, $\overline{A}$, by means of a non-signaling
bipartite state $\eta_A$ perfectly and uniformly correlating each basic measurement on A with
its counterpart on $\overline{A}$. In the case of a quantum-mechanical system associated with
a complex Hilbert space $\textbf{H}$, the conjugate system is that associated with the conjugate
Hilbert space $\overline{\textbf{H}}$, and $\eta_A$ corresponds to the standard maximally entangled
EPR state on $\textbf{H} \otimes \overline{\textbf{H}}$. A second ingredient is the notion of
a $\textit{reversible filter}$, that is, a probabilistically reversible process that independently
attenuates the sensitivity of detectors associated with a measurement. In addition to offering
more flexibility than most existing reconstructions of finite-dimensional quantum theory, the
approach taken here has the advantage of not relying on any form of the "no restriction" hypothesis.
That is, it is not assumed that arbitrary effects are physically measurable, nor that arbitrary
families of physically measurable effects summing to the unit effect, represent physically accessible
observables. An appendix shows how a version of Hardy's "subpace axiom" can replace several assumptions
native to this paper, although at the cost of disallowing superselection rules.
