We investigate the effect of the inertial and non-inertial segments of relativistic motion on the
quantum Fisher information of (1+1) Dirac field modes confined to cavities. %For this purpose,
a bipartite system comprising of Alice's and Rob's cavities with appropriate boundary conditions
is prepared. For the purpose, we consider the situation that Rob's cavity, initially inertial,
accelerates uniformly with respect to its proper time and then again becomes inertial while Alice's
cavity remains inertial. The acceleration is assumed to be very small and its effects were analyzed
in a perturbative regime. For analysis, we consider $\theta$ parameterized two-qubit pure entangled
state and a Werner state. In contrast to the degradation of entanglement due to the relativistic
motion between the cavities, the quantum Fisher information of the pure composite system $\mathcal{F}_\theta$
with respect to parameter $\theta$ is found to be invariant under the same conditions. However,
in the case of the Werner state, the quantum Fisher information displays periodic degradation,
due to the inertial and non-inertial segments of motion. Further, we investigate how this evolution
process affects the quantum Fisher information distribution over the subsystems of Alice's and
Rob's cavities. We find that the quantum Fisher information over the Rob's cavity shows the periodic
degradation behavior depending upon the parameter $\theta$ as well as the uniform acceleration
for both the two qubit pure state and Werner state. The quantum Fisher information over Alice's cavity
remains invariant throughout the motion of Rob's cavity for the two qubit pure state whereas for
Werner state it is affected by the mixing parameter of the Werner state.
