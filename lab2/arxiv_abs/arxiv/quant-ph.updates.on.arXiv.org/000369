We develop an operational approach for reconstructing the quantum theory of qubit systems from
elementary rules on information acquisition. The focus lies on an observer O interrogating a system
S with binary questions and S's state is taken as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. The mathematical
tools of the framework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlying assumptions. Four rules
are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amount of information available to O; (2) the mere existence
of complementary information; (3) O's total amount of information to be preserved in-between interrogations;
and, (4) O's `catalogue of knowledge' to change continuously in time in-between interrogations
and every consistent such evolution to be possible. This approach permits a constructive derivation
of quantum theory, elucidating how the ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility
structure of O's questions matches that of projective measurements in quantum theory, how entanglement
and monogamy of entanglement, non-locality and, more generally, how the correlation structure
of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The rules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic
measure, quantifying O's information about S. Finally, it is shown that the four rules admit two
solutions for the simplest case of a single elementary system: the Bloch ball and disc as state spaces
for a qubit and rebit, respectively, together with their symmetries as time evolution groups. The
reconstruction for arbitrarily many qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130)
where an additional rule eliminates the rebit case. This approach is inspired by (but does not rely
on) the relational interpretation and yields a novel formulation of quantum theory in terms of questions.
