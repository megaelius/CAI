We study the dynamics of the periodically driven Rydberg chain starting from the state with zero
Rydberg excitations (vacuum state denoted by $|0\rangle$) using a square pulse protocol in the
high drive amplitude limit. We show, using exact diagonalization for finite system sizes ($L\le
26$), that the Floquet Hamiltonian of the system, within a range of drive frequencies which we chart
out, hosts a set of quantum scars which have large overlap with the $|0\rangle$ state. These scars
are distinct from their counterparts having high overlap with the maximal Rydberg excitation state
($|\mathbb{Z}_2\rangle$); they coexist with the latter class of scars and lead to persistent coherent
oscillations of the density-density correlator starting from the $|0\rangle$ state. We also identify
special drive frequencies at which the system undergoes perfect dynamic freezing and provide an
analytic explanation for this phenomenon. Finally, we demonstrate that for a wide range of drive
frequencies, the system reaches a steady state with sub-thermal values of the density-density
correlator. The presence of such sub-thermal steady states, which are absent for dynamics starting
from the $|\mathbb{Z}_2\rangle$ state, imply a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis in finite sized Rydberg chains distinct from that due to the scar-induced persistent
oscillations reported earlier. We conjecture that in the thermodynamic limit such states may exist
as pre-thermal steady states that show anomalously slow relaxation. We supplement our numerical
results by deriving an analytic expression for the Floquet Hamiltonian using a Floquet perturbation
theory in the high amplitude limit which provides an analytic, albeit qualitative, understanding
of these phenomena at arbitrary drive frequencies. We discuss experiments which can test our theory.
