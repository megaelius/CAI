In this work we present numerical results for physical quantities in the steady-state obtained
after a variety of product-states initial conditions are evolved unitarily, driven by the dynamics
of quantum integrable models of the rational (XXX) Richardson-Gaudin family, which includes notably
Tavis-Cummings models. The problem of interest here is one where a completely inhomogeneous ensemble
of two-level systems (spins-1/2) are coupled to a single bosonic mode. The long-time averaged magnetisation
along the z-axis as well as the bosonic occupation are evaluated in the diagonal ensemble by performing
the complete sum over the full Hilbert space for small system sizes. These numerically exact results
are independent of any particular choice of Hamiltonian and therefore describe general results
valid for any member of this class of quantum integrable models built out of the same underlying conserved
quantities. The collection of numerical results obtained can be qualitatively understood by a
relaxation process for which, at infinitely strong coupling, every initial state will relax to
a common state where each spin is in a maximally coherent superposition of its $\left|\uparrow\right>$
and $\left|\downarrow\right>$ states, i.e. they are in-plane polarised, and consequently the
bosonic mode is also in a maximally coherent superposition of different occupation number states.
This bosonic coherence being a feature of a superradiant state, we shall loosely use the term superradiant
steady-state to describe it. A finite value of the coupling between the spins and the bosonic mode
then leads to a long-time limit steady-state whose properties are qualitatively captured by a simple
"dynamical" vision in which the coupling strength $V$ plays the role of a time $t_V$ at which this
"relaxation process" towards the common strong coupling superradiant steady-state is interrupted.
