Interference and diffraction of two-identical-particles are considered in the context of open
quantum systems. This theoretical study is carried out within two approaches, the effective time-dependent
Hamiltonian due to Caldirola-Kanai (CK) and the Caldeira-Leggett (CL) one. Two simple but very
illustrative examples are considered, diffraction by a single and two Gaussian slits by analyzing
the mean square separation between particles, single-particle probability density and the simultaneous
detection probability or diffraction patterns. Concerning the single Gaussian slit case, in the
CK approach, the mean square separation drastically reduces with friction, reaching a constant
value due to the localization effect of friction. On the contrary, in the CL approach, temperature
has an opposite effect to friction and this quantity increases. Furthermore, there is a time-interval
for which the joint detection probability measured by an extended detector is greater for fermions
than for bosons. As has already been reported for non-dissipative systems, fermion bunching and
boson anti-bunching are also observed. Decoherence process, loss of indistinguishability, is
settled gradually with time by increasing friction and temperature. In the two Gaussian slit problem
within the CK approach, the single-particle probability density behaves similarly as friction
increases for all kinds of particle-pairs for low values of overlapping between one-particle states.
However, in the opposite limit, friction does not play an important role. Fermions behave completely
different than bosons which themselves behave like distinguishable particles. This last behavior
is also seen when the interference pattern is considered by computing detection probability of
both particles with two detectors, one fixed and one moving.
