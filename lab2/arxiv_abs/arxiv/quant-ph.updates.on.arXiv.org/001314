Exploiting semiconductor fabrication techniques, natural carriers of quantum information such
as atoms, electrons, and photons can be embedded in scalable integrated devices. Integrated optics
provides a versatile platform for large-scale quantum information processing and transceiving
with photons. Scaling up the integrated devices for quantum applications requires highperformance
single-photon generation and photonic qubit-qubit entangling operations. However, previous
demonstrations report major challenges in producing multiple bright, pure and identical single-photons,
and entangling multiple photonic qubits with high fidelity. Another notable challenge is to noiselessly
interface multiphoton sources and multiqubit operators in a single device. Here we demonstrate
on-chip genuine multipartite entanglement and quantum teleportation in silicon, by coherently
controlling an integrated network of microresonator nonlinear single-photon sources and linear-optic
multiqubit entangling circuits. The microresonators are engineered to locally enhance the nonlinearity,
producing multiple frequencyuncorrelated and indistinguishable single-photons, without requiring
any spectral filtering. The multiqubit states are processed in a programmable linear circuit facilitating
Bell-projection and fusion operation in a measurement-based manner. We benchmark key functionalities,
such as intra-/inter-chip teleportation of quantum states, and generation of four-photon Greenberger-HorneZeilinger
entangled states. The production, control, and transceiving of states are all achieved in micrometer-scale
silicon chips, fabricated by complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor processes. Our work lays
the groundwork for scalable on-chip multiphoton technologies for quantum computing and communication.
