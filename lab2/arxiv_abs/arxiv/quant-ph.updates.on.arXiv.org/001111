Genuinely entangled subspaces (GESs) are those subspaces of multipartite Hilbert spaces that
consist of only genuinely multiparty entangled (GME) pure states. They are natural generalizations
of the well-known notion of completely entangled subspaces (CESs), which by definition are void
of fully product vectors. Entangled subspaces are an important tool of quantum information theory
as they directly lead to construtions of entangled states, since any state supported on such a subspace
is automatically entangled. Moreover, they have also proven useful in the area of quantum error
correction (QEC). In our recent contribution [M. Demianowicz and R. Augusiak, Phys. Rev. A 98, 012313
(2018)], we have studied the notion of a GES qualitatively in relation to so--called nonorthogonal
unextendible product bases and provided a few novel constructions of such subspaces. The main aim
of the present work is to perform a quantitative study of the entanglement properties of GESs. First,
we show how one can attempt to compute analytically the subspace entanglement, defined as the entanglement
of the least entangled vector from the subspace, of a GES and illustrate our method applying it to
a new class of GESs. Second, we show that certain semi--definite programming (SDP) relaxations
can be exploited to estimate the entanglement of a GES and apply this observation to few classes of
GESs revealing that in many cases the method provides the exact results. Finally, we study the entanglement
of certain states supported on GESs, which is compared to the obtained values of the entanglement
of the corresponing subspaces, and find the white noise robustness of several GESs. In our study
we use the (generalized) geometric measure of as the quantifier of entanglement.
