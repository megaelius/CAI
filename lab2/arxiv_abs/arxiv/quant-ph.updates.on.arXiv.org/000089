Recently, a programmable quantum annealing machine has been built that minimizes the cost function
of hard optimization problems by adiabatically quenching quantum fluctuations. Tests performed
by different research teams have shown that, indeed, the machine seems to exploit quantum effects.
However experiments on a class of random-bond instances have not yet demonstrated an advantage
over classical optimization algorithms on traditional computer hardware. Here we present evidence
as to why this might be the case. These engineered quantum annealing machines effectively operate
coupled to a decohering thermal bath. Therefore, we study the finite-temperature critical behavior
of the standard benchmark problem used to assess the computational capabilities of these complex
machines. We simulate both random-bond Ising models and spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian
disorder on the D-Wave Chimera topology. Our results show that while the worst-case complexity
of finding a ground state of an Ising spin glass on the Chimera graph is not polynomial, the finite-temperature
phase space is likely rather simple: Spin glasses on Chimera have only a zero-temperature transition.
This means that benchmarking optimization methods using spin glasses on the Chimera graph might
not be the best benchmark problems to test quantum speedup. We propose alternative benchmarks by
embedding potentially harder problems on the Chimera topology. Finally, we also study the (reentrant)
disorder-temperature phase diagram of the random-bond Ising model on the Chimera graph and show
that a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase is stable up to 19.85(15)% antiferromagnetic bonds.
Beyond this threshold the system only displays a zero-temperature spin-glass phase. Our results
therefore show that a careful design of the hardware architecture and benchmark problems is key
when building quantum annealing machines.
