Although regarded today as an important resource in quantum information, nonlocality has yielded
over the years many conceptual conundrums. Among the latter are nonlocal aspects of single particles
which have been of major interest. In this paper, the nonlocality of single quanta is studied in a
square nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer with spatially separated detectors using a delayed
choice modification of quantum measurement outcomes that depend on the complex-valued weak values.
We show that if spacelike separated Bob and Alice are allowed to freely control their quantum devices,
the geometry of the setup constrains the local hidden variables models. In particular, hidden signaling
and a list of contextual instructions are required to split a quantum state characterized by a positive
Wigner function into two quantum states with non-positive Wigner functions. This implies that
local hidden variables models could rely neither on only two hidden variables for position and momentum,
nor on simultaneous factorizability of both the hidden probability densities and weights of splitting
to reproduce the correct quantum distributions. While our analysis does not fully exclude the existence
of nonfactorizable local hidden variables models, it demonstrates that the recently proposed
weak values of quantum histories necessitate contextual splitting of prior commitments to measurement
outcomes, due to functional dependence on the total Feynman sum that yields the complex-valued
quantum probability amplitude for the studied quantum transition. This analysis also highlights
the quantum nature of weak measurements.
