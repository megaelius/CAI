We study quantum algorithms that are given access to trusted and untrusted quantum witnesses. We
establish strong limitations of such algorithms, via new techniques based on Laurent polynomials
(i.e., polynomials with positive and negative integer exponents). Specifically, we resolve the
complexity of approximate counting, the problem of multiplicatively estimating the size of a nonempty
set $S \subseteq [N]$, in two natural generalizations of quantum query complexity. Our first result
holds in the standard Quantum Merlin--Arthur ($\mathsf{QMA}$) setting, in which a quantum algorithm
receives an untrusted quantum witness. We show that, if the algorithm makes $T$ quantum queries
to $S$, and also receives an (untrusted) $m$-qubit quantum witness, then either $m = \Omega(|S|)$
or $T=\Omega \bigl(\sqrt{N/\left| S\right| } \bigr)$. This is optimal, matching the straightforward
protocols where the witness is either empty, or specifies all the elements of $S$. As a corollary,
this resolves the open problem of giving an oracle separation between $\mathsf{SBP}$, the complexity
class that captures approximate counting, and $\mathsf{QMA}$. In our second result, we ask what
if, in addition to a membership oracle for $S$, a quantum algorithm is also given "QSamples" -- i.e.,
copies of the state $\left| S\right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left| S\right| }} \sum_{i\in S}|i\rangle$
-- or even access to a unitary transformation that enables QSampling? We show that, even then, the
algorithm needs either $\Theta \bigl(\sqrt{N/\left| S\right| }\bigr)$ queries or else $\Theta
\bigl(\min \bigl\{\left| S\right| ^{1/3}, \sqrt{N/\left| S\right| }\bigr\}\bigr)$ QSamples
or accesses to the unitary. Our lower bounds in both settings make essential use of Laurent polynomials,
but in different ways.
