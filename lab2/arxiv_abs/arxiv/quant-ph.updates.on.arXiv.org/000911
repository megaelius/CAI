This paper presents the measurement problem from the point of view of the thermal interpretation
of quantum physics introduced in Part II. The measurement of a Hermitian quantity $A$ is regarded
as giving an uncertain value approximating the q-expectation $\langle A\rangle$ rather than (as
tradition wanted to have it) as an exact revelation of an eigenvalue of $A$. Single observations
of microscopic systems are (except under special circumstances) very uncertain measurements
only. The thermal interpretation * treats detection events as a statistical measurement of particle
beam intensity; * claims that the particle concept is only asymptotically valid, under conditions
where particles are essentially free. * claims that the unmodeled environment influences the results
enough to cause all randomness in quantum physics. * implies that part of Born's rule holds exactly:
Whenever a quantity $A$ is measured exactly, its value is an eigenvalue of $A$. * allows one to derive
Born's rule for scattering and in the limit of ideal measurements; * has no explicit collapse -- the
latter emerges approximately in non-isolated subsystems; * gives a valid interpretation of systems
modeled by a quantum-classical dynamics; * explains the peculiar features of the Copenhagen interpretation
(lacking realism between measurements) and the minimal statistical interpretation (lacking
realism for the single case) where these interpretations apply -- in the microscopic domain. The
thermal interpretation is an interpretation of quantum physics that is in principle refutable
by theoretical arguments leading to a negative answer to a number of open issues collected at the
end of the paper, since there is plenty of experimental evidence for each of the points mentioned
there.
