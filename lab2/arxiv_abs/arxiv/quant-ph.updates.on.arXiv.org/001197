The possibility of a superradiant phase transition is one of the most surprising collective phenomena
to have been predicted in light-matter physics. It is however, still debated, because of numerous
apparently conflicting no-go and counter no-go theorems which are proven in different gauges.
It has been suggested for example, that artificial systems are required to circumvent the no-go
theorem. We show that a unique phase transition does occur in archetypal many-dipole cavity QED
systems, and that it manifests unambiguously via a macroscopic gauge-invariant polarisation.
We show further that the gauge choice controls the extent to which this polarisation is included
as part of the radiative quantum subsystem and thereby determines the degree to which the abnormal
phase is classed as superradiant. This resolves the long-standing paradox of no-go and counter
no-go theorems for superradiance, which refer to different definitions of radiation and are therefore
not contradictory, but actually equivalent. A separate issue is that each gauge provides a different
two-level approximation of the material dipoles. Our approach enables characterisation of physical
behaviour in terms of any chosen material and radiation subsystems, using any of the non-equivalent
approximate models. We provide exact numerical results for a finite number of dipoles, exhibiting
clear precursors to the phase transition and demonstrating how accurate approximate predictions
can be identified. Arbitrary-gauge QED therefore eliminates all apparent inconsistencies in
the description of many-dipole cavity QED systems and their thermodynamic phases.
