As Moore's law reaches its limits, quantum computers are emerging with the promise of dramatically
outperforming classical computers. We have witnessed the advent of quantum processors with over
$50$ quantum bits (qubits), which are expected to be beyond the reach of classical simulation. Quantum
supremacy is the event at which the old Extended Church-Turing Thesis is overturned: A quantum computer
performs a task that is practically impossible for any classical (super)computer. The demonstration
requires both a solid theoretical guarantee and an experimental realization. The lead candidate
is Random Circuit Sampling (RCS), which is the task of sampling from the output distribution of random
quantum circuits. Google recently announced a $53-$qubit experimental demonstration of RCS.
Soon after, classical algorithms appeared that challenge the supremacy of random circuits by estimating
their outputs. How hard is it to classically simulate the output of random quantum circuits? We prove
that estimating the output probabilities of random quantum circuits is formidably hard ($\#P$-Hard)
for any classical computer. This makes RCS the strongest candidate for demonstrating quantum supremacy
relative to all other proposals. The robustness to the estimation error that we prove may serve as
a new hardness criterion for the performance of classical algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce
the Cayley path interpolation between any two gates of a quantum computation and convolve recent
advances in quantum complexity and information with probability and random matrices. Furthermore,
we apply algebraic geometry to generalize the well-known Berlekamp-Welch algorithm that is widely
used in coding theory and cryptography. Our results imply that there is an exponential hardness
barrier for the classical simulation of most quantum circuits.
