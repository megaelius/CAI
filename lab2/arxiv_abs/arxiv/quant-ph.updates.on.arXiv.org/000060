If you have a restless intellect, it is very likely that you have played at some point with the idea
of investigating the meaning and conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics. It is also probable
(albeit not certain) that your intentions have been stopped on their tracks by an encounter with
some version of the "Shut up and calculate!" command. You may have heard that everything is already
understood. That understanding is not your job. Or, if it is, it is either impossible or very difficult.
Maybe somebody explained to you that physics is concerned with "hows" and not with "whys"; that whys
are the business of "philosophy" ---you know, that dirty word. That what you call "understanding"
is just being Newtonian; which of course you cannot ask quantum mechanics to be. Perhaps they also
added some norms: The important thing a theory must do is predict; a theory must only talk about measurable
quantities. It may also be the case that you almost asked "OK, and why is that?", but you finally bit
your tongue. If you persisted in your intentions and the debate got a little heated up, it is even possible
that it was suggested that you suffered of some type of moral or epistemic weakness that tend to disappear
as you grow up. Maybe you received some job advice such as "Don't work in that if you ever want to own
a house". I have certainly met all these objections in my short career, and I think that they are all
just wrong. In this somewhat personal document, I try to defend that making sense of quantum mechanics
is an exciting, challenging, important and open scientific endeavor. I do this by compulsively
quoting Feynman (and others), and I provide some arguments that you might want to use the next time
you confront the mentioned "opinions". By analogy with the anti-rationalistic Copenhagen command,
all the arguments are subsumed in a standard answer to it: "Shut up and let me think!"
