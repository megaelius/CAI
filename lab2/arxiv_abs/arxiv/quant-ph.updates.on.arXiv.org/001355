A central problem in the study of resource theories is to find functions that are nonincreasing under
resource conversions---termed monotones---in order to quantify resourcefulness. Various constructions
of monotones appear in many different concrete resource theories. How general are these constructions?
What are the necessary conditions on a resource theory for a given construction to be applicable?
To answer these questions, we introduce a broad scheme for constructing monotones. It involves
finding an order-preserving map from the preorder of resources of interest to a distinct preorder
for which nontrivial monotones are previously known or can be more easily constructed; these monotones
are then pulled back through the map. In one of the two main classes we study, the preorder of resources
is mapped to a preorder of sets of resources, where the order relation is set inclusion, such that
monotones can be defined via maximizing or minimizing the value of a function within these sets.
In the other class, the preorder of resources is mapped to a preorder of tuples of resources, and one
pulls back monotones that measure the amount of distinguishability of the different elements of
the tuple (hence its information content). Monotones based on contractions arise naturally in
the latter class, and, more surprisingly, so do weight and robustness measures. In addition to capturing
many standard monotone constructions, our scheme also suggests significant generalizations
of these. In order to properly capture the breadth of applicability of our results, we present them
within a novel abstract framework for resource theories in which the notion of composition is independent
of the types of the resources involved (i.e., whether they are states, channels, combs, etc.).
