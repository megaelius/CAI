In this Ph.D. thesis, I investigate the communication abilities of non-inertial observers and
the precision to which they can measure parametrized states. I introduce relativistic quantum
field theory with field quantisation, and the definition and transformations of mode functions
in Minkowski, Schwarzschild and Rindler spaces. I introduce information theory by discussing
the nature of information, defining the entropic information measures, and highlighting the differences
between classical and quantum information. I review the field of relativistic quantum information.
We investigate the communication abilities of an inertial observer to a relativistic observer
hovering above a Schwarzschild black hole, using the Rindler approximation. We compare both classical
communication and quantum entanglement generation of the state merging protocol, for both the
single and dual rail encodings. We find that while classical communication remains finite right
up to the horizon, the quantum entanglement generation tends to zero. We investigate the observers'
abilities to precisely measure the parameter of a state that is communicated between Alice and Rob.
This parameter was encoded to either the amplitudes of a single excitation state or the phase of a
NOON state. With NOON states the dual rail encoding provided greater precision, which is different
to the results for the other situations. The precision was maximum for a particular number of excitations
in the NOON state. We calculated the bipartite communication for Alice-Rob and Alice-AntiRob beyond
the single mode approximation. Rob and AntiRob are causally disconnected counter-accelerating
observers. We found that Alice must choose in advance with whom, Rob or AntiRob she wants to create
entanglement using a particular setup. She could communicate classically to both.
