In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics (QM), as well as
to provide insight on teaching, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles
in basic QM (RQ1). The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis
of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of upper-undergraduate course textbooks
and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties in QM. The answer to RQ1 consists
in seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed
to account for the results of measurement and time evolution both at a qualitative and quantitative
level. By means of these instruments, it is possible to visualize and explore the different facets
of the interplay of the vector structure of the quantum states and the operator structure of the observables,
and to highlight the educational significance of the relations between observables. The relations
provide tools for predicting the results of the processes, and explain how information on measurement
and time evolution is encoded in the modulus and in the phase of the probability amplitudes. In addition,
basic phenomena and formal structures are traceable to the emergence of a specific relation: incompatibility
of observables. At upper-undergraduate level, the instruments developed in this work can be used
by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized knowledge structure and
by researchers as a basis for the design of investigations into student understanding. While this
framework may be adapted to different approaches and interpretive stances, it provides indications
in favor of a spin-first approach over a waves-first one. At high school level, a simplified version
of the framework has been used as a basis for the design of a teaching-learning sequence.
