We have studied ${\rm SU}(2)_k$ anyon models, assessing their prospects for topological quantum
computation. In particular, we have compared the Ising ($k=2$) anyon and Fibonacci ($k=3$) anyon
models, motivated by their potential for future realizations based on Majorana fermion quasiparticles
or exotic fractional quantum-Hall states, respectively. The quantum computational performance
of the different anyon models is quantified at single qubit level by the difference between a target
unitary operator and its approximation realised by anyon braiding. To facilitate efficient comparisons,
we have developed a Monte Carlo enhanced Solovay-Kitaev quantum compiler algorithm that finds
optimal braid words in polynomial time from the exponentially large search tree. Since universal
quantum computation cannot be achieved within the Ising anyon model by braiding alone, we have introduced
an additional elementary phase gate to model a non-topological measurement process, which restores
universality of the anyon model at the cost of breaking the full topological protection. We model
conventional kinds of decoherence processes algorithmically by introducing a controllable noise
term to all non-topological gate operations. We find that for reasonable levels of decoherence,
even the hybrid Ising anyon model retains a significant topological advantage over a conventional,
non-topological, quantum computer. Furthermore, we find that only surprisingly short anyon braids
are ever required to be compiled due to the gate noise exceeding the intrinsic error of the braid words
already for word lengths of the order of $100$ elementary braids. We conclude that the future for
hybrid topological quantum computation remains promising.
