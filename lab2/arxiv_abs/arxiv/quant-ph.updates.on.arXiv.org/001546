The quench dynamics of many-body quantum systems may exhibit non-analyticities in the Loschmidt
echo, a phenomenon known as dynamical phase transition (DPT). Despite considerable research into
the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon, several open questions still remain. Motivated
by this, we put forth a detailed study of DPTs from the perspective of quantum phase space and entropy
production, a key concept in thermodynamics. We focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and use
spin coherent states to construct the corresponding Husimi-$Q$ quasi-probability distribution.
The entropy of the $Q$-function, known as Wehrl entropy, provides a measure of the coarse-grained
dynamics of the system and, therefore, evolves non-trivially even for closed systems. We show that
critical quenches lead to a quasi-monotonic growth of the Wehrl entropy in time, combined with small
oscillations. The former reflects the information scrambling characteristic of these transitions
and serves as a measure of entropy production. On the other hand, the small oscillations imply negative
entropy production rates and, therefore, signal the recurrences of the Loschmidt echo. Finally,
we also study a Gaussification of the model based on a modified Holstein-Primakoff approximation.
This allows us to identify the relative contribution of the low energy sector to the emergence of
DPTs. The results presented in this article are relevant not only from the dynamical quantum phase
transition perspective, but also for the field of quantum thermodynamics, since they point out
that the Wehrl entropy can be used as a viable measure of entropy production.
