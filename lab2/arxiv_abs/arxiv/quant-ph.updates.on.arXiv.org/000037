The basic principles of the correlation femtoscopy, including its correspondence to the Hanbury
Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry, are re-examined. The main subject of the paper is an analysis
of the correlation femtoscopy when the source size is as small as the order of the uncertainty limit.
It is about 1 fm for the current high energy experiments. Then the standard femtoscopy model of random
sources is inapplicable. The uncertainty principle leads to the partial indistinguishability
and coherence of closely located emitters that affect the observed femtoscopy scales. In thermal
systems the role of corresponding coherent length is taken by the thermal de Broglie wavelength
that also defines the size of a single emitter. The formalism of partially coherent phases in the
amplitudes of closely located individual emitters is used for the quantitative analysis. The general
approach is illustrated analytically for the case of the Gaussian approximation for emitting sources.
A reduction of the interferometry radii and a suppression of the Bose-Einstein correlation functions
for small sources due to the uncertainty principle are found. There is a positive correlation between
the source size and the intercept of the correlation function. The peculiarities of the non-femtoscopic
correlations caused by minijets and fluctuations of the initial states of the systems formed in
$pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions are also analyzed. The factorization property for the contributions
of femtoscopic and non-femtoscopic correlations into complete correlation function is observed
in numerical calculations in a wide range of the model parameters.
