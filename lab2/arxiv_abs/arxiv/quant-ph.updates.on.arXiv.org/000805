The coupling between gauge and matter fields plays an important role in many models of high-energy
and condensed matter physics [1-3]. In these models, the gauge fields are dynamical quantum degrees
of freedom in the sense that they are influenced by the spatial configuration and motion of the matter
field. Since the resulting dynamics is hard to compute, it was proposed to implement this fundamental
coupling mechanism in quantum simulation platforms with the ultimate goal to emulate lattice gauge
theories [4-7]. So far, synthetic magnetic fields for atoms in optical lattices were intrinsically
classical, as these did not feature back-action from the atoms [8,9]. Here, we realize the fundamental
ingredient for a density-dependent gauge field by engineering non-trivial Peierls phases that
depend on the site occupation of fermions in a Hubbard dimer. Our method relies on breaking time-reversal
symmetry (TRS) by driving the optical lattice simultaneously at two frequencies. This creates
interfering pathways for density-induced tunnelling, each in resonance with the on-site interaction
of two fermionic atoms, and controllable in amplitude and phase. We demonstrate a technique to quantify
the amplitude of the resulting density-assisted tunnelling matrix element and to directly measure
its Peierls phase with respect to the single-particle hopping. The tunnel coupling features two
distinct regimes as a function of the two modulation amplitudes, which can be characterised by a
Z2-invariant. Moreover, we provide a full tomography of the winding structure of the Peierls phase
around a Dirac point that appears in the driving parameter space. For future experiments, this structure
provides unique tuneability of the associated density-dependent gauge field by using modulation
parameters with temporal or spatial dependencies.
