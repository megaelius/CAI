Compressive sensing is a novel approach that linearly samples sparse or compressible signals at
a rate much below the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate and outperforms traditional signal processing
techniques in acquiring and reconstructing such signals. Compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty
is an extension of the standard compressive sensing problem that appears in various applications
including but not limited to cognitive radio sensing, calibration of the antenna, and deconvolution.
The original problem of compressive sensing is NP-hard so the traditional techniques, such as convex
and nonconvex relaxations and greedy algorithms, apply stringent constraints on the measurement
matrix to indirectly handle this problem in the realm of classical computing. We propose well-posed
approaches for both binary compressive sensing and binary compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty
problems that are tractable by quantum annealers. Our approach formulates an Ising model whose
ground state represents a sparse solution for the binary compressive sensing problem and then employs
an alternating minimization scheme to tackle the binary compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty
problem. This setting only requires the solution uniqueness of the considered problem to have a
successful recovery process, and therefore the required conditions on the measurement matrix
are notably looser. As a proof of concept, we can demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach
on the D-Wave quantum annealers; however, we can adapt our method to employ other modern computing
phenomena -like adiabatic quantum computers (in general), CMOS annealers, optical parametric
oscillators, and neuromorphic computing.
