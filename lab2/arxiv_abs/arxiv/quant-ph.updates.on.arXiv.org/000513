This note is a reply to the paper arXiv:1801.05590: "The equivalence of the Power-Zineau-Woolley
picture and the Poincar{\'e} gauge from the very first principles" by G. K{\'o}nya, et al. In a recent
paper [2], we have shown that the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian does not derived from the minimal-coupling
hamiltonian with the help of a gauge transformation. This result has been challenged by G. K{\'o}nya,
al. in a comment 1 where the authors claim the equivalence between the Power-Zienau-Woolley hamiltonian
and the minimal-coupling hamiltonian in the Poincar{\'e} gauge. They claim that we have made one
error and one wrong emphasis in our paper: The error as summarized by G. K{\'o}nya al. would be: "The
canonical field momentum is not gauge invariant. Equivalent transformations of the Lagrangian
do change the momentum. In field theories, gauge transformations are special cases of such transformations.
The electric field E is gauge invariant, but its capacity of being the canonical momentum is not.
" The wrong emphasis as summarized by G.K{\'o}nya al. would be: "The use of the canonical coordinate/momentum
pair A p and E in Poincar{\'e} gauge is presented as mandatory in Rousseau and Felbacq paper, whereas
as there is a certain freedom of choice in selecting this pair. Also in Poincar{\'e} gauge it is possible
to use A c as canonical coordinate, in which case the conjugate momentum will be D. This is the most
convenient choice in terms of the set of nontrivial Dirac brackets. Cf. Table 1 in G. K{\'o}nya al.
paper 1 for possible choices." We do not share these conclusions and show in this reply that these
statements are incorrect. Specifically, we show that under a gauge transformation, the canonical
momentum $\pi$(x,t) conjugated to the vector potential A(x,t) is given by $\pi$(x,t) = --$\epsilon$\_0
E(x,t). This happens because the Lagrangian does not contains terms proportional to $\partial$\_t
$\phi$ (x,t) where $\phi$ (x,t) is the scalar potential. Moreover our choice of canonical variables
was challenged. Actually, our set of independent variables is exactly the same as in G. K{\'o}nya
al. except that we do not write explicitly the dependent variables in term of the independent ones.
This is one great advantage of the Dirac procedure for constrained hamiltonian.
