In this research notebook on quantum computation and applications for quantum engineers, researchers,
and scientists, we will discuss and summarized the core principles and practical application areas
of quantum computation. We first discuss the historical prospect from which quantum computing
emerged from the early days of computing before the dominance of modern microprocessors. And the
re-emergence of that quest with the sunset of Moore's law in the current decade. The mapping of computation
onto the behavior of physical systems is a historical challenge vividly illustrate by considering
how quantum bits may be realized with a wide variety of physical systems, spanning from atoms to photons,
using semiconductors and superconductors. The computing algorithms also change with the underline
variety of physical systems and the possibility of encoding the information in the quantum systems
compared to the ordinary classical computers because of these new abilities afforded by quantum
systems. We will also consider the emerging engineering, science, technology, business, and social
implications of these advancements. We will describe a substantial difference between quantum
and classical computation paradigm. After we will discuss and understand engineering challenges
currently faced by developers of the real quantum computation system. We will evaluate the essential
technology required for quantum computers to be able to function correctly. Later on, discuss the
potential business application, which can be touch by these new computation capabilities. We utilize
the IBM Quantum Experience to run the real-world problem, although on a small scale.
