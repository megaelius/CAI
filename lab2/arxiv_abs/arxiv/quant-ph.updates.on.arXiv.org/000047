Knill demonstrated a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme based on concatenated error-detecting
codes and postselection with a simulated error threshold of 3% over the depolarizing channel. %We
design a two-dimensional architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computation based on Knill's
postselection scheme. We show how to use Knill's postselection scheme in a practical two-dimensional
quantum architecture that we designed with the goal to optimize the error correction properties,
while satisfying important architectural constraints. In our 2D architecture, one logical qubit
is embedded in a tile consisting of $5\times 5$ physical qubits. The movement of these qubits is modeled
as noisy SWAP gates and the only physical operations that are allowed are local one- and two-qubit
gates. We evaluate the practical properties of our design, such as its error threshold, and compare
it to the concatenated Bacon-Shor code and the concatenated Steane code. Assuming that all gates
have the same error rates, we obtain a threshold of $3.06\times 10^{-4}$ in a local adversarial stochastic
noise model, which is the highest known error threshold for concatenated codes in 2D. We also present
a Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D architecture with depolarizing noise and we calculate a pseudo-threshold
of about 0.1%. With memory error rates one-tenth of the worst gate error rates, the threshold for
the adversarial noise model, and the pseudo-threshold over depolarizing noise, are $4.06\times
10^{-4}$ and 0.2%, respectively. In a hypothetical technology where memory error rates are negligible,
these thresholds can be further increased by shrinking the tiles into a $4\times 4$ layout.
