In the stabilizer circuit model of quantum computation, universality requires a resource known
as magic. Here, we propose three new ways to quantify the magic of a quantum state using magic monotones,
apply the monotones in the characterization of state conversions under stabilizer operations,
and connect them with the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We first present a complete
theory of these quantifiers for tensor products of single-qubit states, for which the monotones
are all equal and all act multiplicatively, constituting the first qubit magic monotones to have
this property. We use the monotones to establish several asymptotic and non-asymptotic bounds
on state interconversion and distillation rates. We then relate our quantifiers directly to the
runtime of classical simulation algorithms, showing that a large amount of magic is a necessary
requirement for any quantum speedup. One of our classical simulation algorithms is a quasi-probability
simulator with its runtime connected to a generalized notion of negativity, which is exponentially
faster than all prior qubit quasi-probability simulation algorithms. We also introduce a new variant
of the stabilizer rank simulation algorithm suitable for mixed states, while improving the runtime
bounds for this class of simulations. Our work reveals interesting connections between quasi-probability
and stabilizer rank simulators, which previously appeared to be unrelated. Generalizing the approach
beyond the theory of magic states, we establish methods for the quantitative characterization
of classical simulability for more general quantum resources, and use them in the resource theory
of quantum coherence to connect the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence with the simulation of free operations.
