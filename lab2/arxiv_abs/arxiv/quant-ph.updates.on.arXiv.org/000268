We study fermionic topological phases using the technique of fermion condensation. We give a prescription
for performing fermion condensation in bosonic topological phases which contain a fermion. Our
approach to fermion condensation can roughly be understood as coupling the parent bosonic topological
phase to a phase of physical fermions, and condensing pairs of physical and emergent fermions. There
are two distinct types of objects in fermionic theories, which we call "m-type" and "q-type" particles.
The endomorphism algebras of q-type particles are complex Clifford algebras, and they have no analogues
in bosonic theories. We construct a fermionic generalization of the tube category, which allows
us to compute the quasiparticle excitations in fermionic topological phases. We then prove a series
of results relating data in condensed theories to data in their parent theories; for example, if
$\mathcal{C}$ is a modular tensor category containing a fermion, then the tube category of the condensed
theory satisfies $\textbf{Tube}(\mathcal{C}/\psi) \cong \mathcal{C} \times (\mathcal{C}/\psi)$.
We also study how modular transformations, fusion rules, and coherence relations are modified
in the fermionic setting, prove a fermionic version of the Verlinde dimension formula, construct
a commuting projector lattice Hamiltonian for fermionic theories, and write down a fermionic version
of the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury state sum. A large portion of this work is devoted to three
detailed examples of performing fermion condensation to produce fermionic topological phases:
we condense fermions in the Ising theory, the $SO(3)_6$ theory, and the $\frac{1}{2}\text{E}_6$
theory, and compute the quasiparticle excitation spectrum in each of these examples.
