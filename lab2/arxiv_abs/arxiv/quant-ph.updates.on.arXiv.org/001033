The characterization, explanation, and quantification of quantumness, in particular the discrimination
from classicality in terms of classical strategies, lie at the heart of quantum physics. Dephasing
processes, caused by the non-dissipative information exchange between a quantum system and its
environment, play a central role in that respect, as they control the transition between the quantum
and the classical realm. Recently, it is shown that dephasing dynamics itself can exhibit classical
or nonclassical traits, depending on the nature of the system-environment correlations and the
related (im)possibility to simulate these dynamics with Hamiltonian ensembles---the classical
strategy. Here we propose to extend this classification towards quantifying the nonclassicality
of pure dephasing dynamics. In the spirit of the Wigner function, we generalize Hamiltonian ensembles
to encompass quasi-probability distributions comprising negative values. By using Lie algebra
representations, Fourier transforms on groups, and root space decompositions, we achieve to overcome
the difficulty of pinning down the uniqueness of quasi-probability distributions, provided diagonal
member Hamiltonians, and therefore lift such distributions as faithful representations of pure
dephasing dynamics; moreover, we show how to retrieve these quasi-probability distributions.
This allows us to quantify process-nonclassicality time-independently, in terms of the deviations
of the corresponding quasi-probability distributions from classical probability distributions.
We illustrate our method for qubit, qutrit, and qubit-pair pure dephasing and demonstrate how to
implement our approach with quantum process tomography and quantum state tomography experiments.
