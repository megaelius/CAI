We report on an improved systematic evaluation of the JILA SrI optical lattice clock, achieving
a nearly identical systematic uncertainty compared to the previous strontium accuracy record
set by the JILA SrII optical lattice clock (OLC) at $2.1 \times 10^{-18}$. This improves upon the
previous evaluation of the JILA SrI optical lattice clock in 2013, and we achieve a more than twenty-fold
reduction in systematic uncertainty to $2.0 \times 10^{-18}$. A seven-fold improvement in clock
stability, reaching $4.8 \times 10^{-17}/\sqrt{\tau}$ for an averaging time $\tau$ in seconds,
allows the clock to average to its systematic uncertainty in under 10 minutes. We improve the systematic
uncertainty budget in several important ways. This includes a novel scheme for taming blackbody
radiation-induced frequency shifts through active stabilization and characterization of the
thermal environment, inclusion of higher-order terms in the lattice light shift, and updated atomic
coefficients. Along with careful control of other systematic effects, we achieve low temporal
drift of systematic offsets and high uptime of the clock. We additionally present an improved evaluation
of the second order Zeeman coefficient that is applicable to all Sr optical lattice clocks. These
improvements in performance have enabled several important studies including frequency ratio
measurements through the Boulder Area Clock Optical Network (BACON), a high precision comparison
with the JILA 3D lattice clock, a demonstration of a new all-optical time scale combining SrI and
a cryogenic silicon cavity, and a high sensitivity search for ultralight scalar dark matter.
