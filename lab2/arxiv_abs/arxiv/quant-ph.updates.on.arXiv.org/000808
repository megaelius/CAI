Phase transitions are driven by collective fluctuations of a system's constituents that emerge
at a critical point. This mechanism has been extensively explored for classical and quantum systems
in equilibrium, whose critical behavior is described by a general theory of phase transitions.
Recently, however, fundamentally distinct phase transitions have been discovered for out-of-equilibrium
quantum systems, which can exhibit critical behavior that defies this description and is not well
understood. A paradigmatic example is the many-body-localization (MBL) transition, which marks
the breakdown of quantum thermalization. Characterizing quantum critical behavior in an MBL system
requires the measurement of its entanglement properties over space and time, which has proven experimentally
challenging due to stringent requirements on quantum state preparation and system isolation.
Here, we observe quantum critical behavior at the MBL transition in a disordered Bose-Hubbard system
and characterize its entanglement properties via its quantum correlations. We observe strong
correlations, whose emergence is accompanied by the onset of anomalous diffusive transport throughout
the system, and verify their critical nature by measuring their system-size dependence. The correlations
extend to high orders in the quantum critical regime and appear to form via a sparse network of many-body
resonances that spans the entire system. Our results unify the system's microscopic structure
with its macroscopic quantum critical behavior, and they provide an essential step towards understanding
criticality and universality in non-equilibrium systems.
