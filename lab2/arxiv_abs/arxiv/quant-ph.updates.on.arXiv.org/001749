Measurements in quantum theory exhibit incompatibility, i.e., they can fail to be jointly measurable.
An intuitive way to represent the (in)compatibility relations among a set of measurements is via
a hypergraph representing their joint measurability structure: its vertices represent measurements
and its hyperedges represent (all and only) subsets of compatible measurements. Projective measurements
in quantum theory realize (all and only) joint measurability structures that are graphs. On the
other hand, general measurements represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) can
realize arbitrary joint measurability structures. Here we explore the scope of joint measurability
structures realizable with qubit POVMs. We develop a technique that we term marginal surgery to
obtain nontrivial joint measurability structures starting from a set of compatible measurements.
We show explicit examples of marginal surgery on a special set of qubit POVMs to construct joint measurability
structures such as $N$-cycle and $N$-Specker scenarios for any integer $N\geq 3$. We also show the
realizability of various joint measurability structures with $N\in\{4,5,6\}$ vertices. In particular,
we show that all possible joint measurability structures with $N=4$ vertices are realizable. We
conjecture that all joint measurability structures are realizable with qubit POVMs. This contrasts
with the unbounded dimension required in R. Kunjwal et al., Phys. Rev. A 89, 052126 (2014). Our results
also render this previous construction maximally efficient in terms of the required Hilbert space
dimension. We also obtain a sufficient condition for the joint measurability of any set of binary
qubit POVMs which powers many of our results and should be of independent interest.
