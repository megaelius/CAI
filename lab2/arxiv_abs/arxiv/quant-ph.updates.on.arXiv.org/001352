To determine the fundamental sensitivity limit of an optical receiver one must have a complete quantum
mechanical description of the incoming signals, even if those signals are from ``classical" sources
of light, i.e., ones whose photo-detection statistics with conventional receivers can be explained
correctly using the shot-noise theory. In this work, we calculate the fundamental (quantum) limit
for discriminating between two types of classical states in the low photon number regime: a coherent
state, a pure-state quantum description of ideal (coherent) laser light with Poisson distributed
photon statistics, and a thermal state, a (incoherent) mixed state with Bose-Einstein photon statistics.
The Helstrom bound for discrimination error probability for single mode measurement is computed
along with error probability bounds for direct detection, coherent homodyne detection and the
Kennedy receiver. The generalized Kennedy (GK) receiver is shown to closely approach the Helstrom
limit. We experimentally validate these results by generating coherent and thermal light and demonstrate
that for signal strengths $\bar{n}_{s} > 0.01$ photons/mode, using a GK receiver with a quasi-photon-number
resolving detector, we can approach quantum-limited discrimination performance, out-performing
the discrimination capability achievable with traditional optical sensors. We demonstrate $\sim
17$ dB improvement in discrimination sensitivity over direct detection using a GK receiver, and
an improvement of $17\%$ in error probability over coherent detection at a mean signal photon number
$\bar{n}_{s} = 0.4$ photons/mode.
