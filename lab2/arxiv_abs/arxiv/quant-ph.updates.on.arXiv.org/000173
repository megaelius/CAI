We present an alternative Eulerian hydrodynamic model for the electromagnetic field in which the
discrete vector indices in Maxwell\s equations are replaced by continuous angular freedoms, and
develop the corresponding Lagrangian picture in which the fluid particles have rotational and
translational freedoms. This enables us to extend to the electromagnetic field the exact method
of state construction proposed previously for spin 0 systems, in which the time-dependent wavefunction
is computed from a single-valued continuum of deterministic trajectories where two spacetime
points are linked by at most a single orbit. The deduction of Maxwell\s equations from continuum
mechanics is achieved by generalizing the spin 0 theory to a general Riemannian manifold from which
the electromagnetic construction is extracted as a special case. In particular, the flat-space
Maxwell equations are represented as a curved-space Schr\"odinger equation for a massive system.
The Lorentz covariance of the Eulerian field theory is obtained from the non-covariant Lagrangian-coordinate
model as a kind of collective effect. The method makes manifest the electromagnetic analogue of
the quantum potential that is tacit in Maxwell\s equations. This implies a novel definition of the
\classical limit\ of Maxwell\s equations that differs from geometrical optics. It is shown that
Maxwell\s equations may be obtained by canonical quantization of the classical model. Using the
classical trajectories a novel expression is derived for the propagator of the electromagnetic
field in the Eulerian picture. The trajectory and propagator methods of solution are illustrated
for the case of a light wave.
