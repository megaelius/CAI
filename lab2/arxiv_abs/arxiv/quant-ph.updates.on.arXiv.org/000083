We introduce a model which allows to represent the probabilities associated with an arbitrary measurement
situation and use it to explain the emergence of quantum probabilities (the Born rule) as 'uniform'
fluctuations on this measurement situation. The model exploits the geometry of simplexes to represent
the states, in a way that the measurement probabilities can be derived as the 'Lebesgue measure'
of suitably defined convex subregions of the simplexes. We consider a very simple and evocative
physical realization of the abstract model, using a material point particle which is acted upon
by elastic membranes, which by breaking and collapsing produce the different possible outcomes.
This easy to visualize mechanical realization allows one to gain considerable insight into the
possible hidden structure of an arbitrary measurement process. We also show that the Lebesgue-model
can be further generalized into a model describing conditions of lack of knowledge generated by
'non-uniform' fluctuations. In this more general framework we define and motivate a notion of 'universal
measurement', describing the most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement,
emphasizing that the uniform fluctuations characterizing quantum measurements can also be understood
as an average over all possible forms of non-uniform fluctuations which can be actualized in a measurement
context. This means that the Born rule of quantum mechanics can be understood as a first order approximation
of a more general non-uniform theory, thus explaining part of the great success of quantum probability
in the description of different domains of reality. This is the first part of a two-part article.
In the second part, the proof of the equivalence between universal measurements and uniform measurements,
and its significance for quantum theory as a first order approximation, is given and further analyzed.
