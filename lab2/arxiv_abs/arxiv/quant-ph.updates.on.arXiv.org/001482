The famous singlet correlations of a composite quantum system consisting of two spatially separated
components exhibit notable features of two kinds. The first kind consists of striking certainty
relations: perfect correlation and perfect anti-correlation in certain settings. The second
kind consists of a number of symmetries, in particular, invariance under rotation, as well as invariance
under exchange of components, parity, or chirality. In this note, I investigate the class of correlation
functions that can be generated by classical composite physical systems when we restrict attention
to systems which reproduce the certainty relations exactly, and for which the rotational invariance
of the correlation function is the manifestation of rotational invariance of the underlying classical
physics. I call such correlation functions classical EPR-B correlations. It turns out that the
other three (binary) symmetries can then be obtained "for free": they are exhibited by the correlation
function, and can be imposed on the underlying physics by adding an underlying randomisation level.
We end up with a simple probabilistic description of all possible classical EPR-B correlations
in terms of a "spinning coloured disk" model, and a research programme: describe these functions
in a concise analytic way. We survey open problems, and we show that the widespread idea that "quantum
correlations are more extreme than classical physics allows" is at best highly inaccurate, through
giving a concrete example of a classical correlation which satisfies all the symmetries and all
the certainty relations and which exceeds the quantum correlations over a whole range of settings
