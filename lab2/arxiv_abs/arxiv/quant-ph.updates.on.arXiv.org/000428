In cavity QED, the mutual interaction between natural atomic systems in presence of a radiation
field was ignored due to its negligible impact compared with the coupling to the field. The newly
engineered artificial atomic systems (such as quantum dots and superconducting circuits) proposed
for quantum information processing enjoy strong interaction with same type of systems or even with
other types in hybrid structures, which is coherently controllable and moreover they can be efficiently
coupled to radiation fields. We present an exact analytic solution for the time evolution of a composite
system of two interacting two-level quantum systems coupled to a single mode radiation field, which
can be realized in cavity (circuit) QED. We show how the non-classical dynamical properties of the
composite system are affected and can be tuned by introducing and varying the mutual coupling between
the two systems. Particularly, the collapse-revival pattern shows a splitting during the revival
intervals as the coupling ratio (system-system to system-field) increases, which is a sign of an
interruption in the system-radiation energy exchange process. Furthermore, the time evolution
of the bipartite entanglement between the two systems is found to vary significantly depending
on the coupling ratio as well as the initial state of the composite system resulting in either an oscillatory
behavior or a collapse-revival like pattern. Increasing the coupling ratio enhances the entanglement,
raises its oscillation average value and emphasizes the collapse-revival like pattern. However,
raising the coupling ratio beyond unity increases the revival time considerably. The effect of
the other system parameters such as detuning and radiation field intensity on the system dynamics
has been investigated as well.
