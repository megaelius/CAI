We have studied extremal entanglement witnesses on a bipartite composite quantum system. A Hermitian
matrix $\Omega$ is an entanglement witness if $\Tr\Omega\rho\geq 0$ when $\rho$ is a pure product
state, $\rho=\psi\psi^{\dag}$ with $\psi=\phi\otimes\chi$. The set of normalized witnesses
is a compact convex set, defined by its extremal points. The expectation value $\Tr\Omega\rho$
as a function of vectors $\phi$ and $\chi$ is a positive semidefinite biquadratic form. Every zero
of the form imposes strong constraints. The first derivative must vanish, and the Hessian matrix
at the zero must be positive semidefinite. The eigenvectors of the Hessian with zero eigenvalue,
if such exist, we call Hessian zeros. A zero of the biquadratic form is quadratic if it has no Hessian
zeros, otherwise it is quartic. We prove that a witness is extremal if and only if no other witness
has the same set, or a larger set, of zeros and Hessian zeros. The complete set of constraints defined
by the zeros and Hessian zeros of a witness gives a test for extremality, showing all directions,
if any, in which to search for witnesses that have more zeros or Hessian zeros and hence are more nearly
extremal. Iterated searches in random directions lead to an extremal witness, usually with a fixed
number of isolated quadratic zeros. In spite of the fact that extremal witnesses of this type are
by far the most common, it seems that they have never been described in the literature. We discuss
briefly some related topics: the relation between the facial structures of the dual sets of witnesses
and separable states; extremality and optimality of witnesses; and a conjecture of separability
of the structural physical approximation (SPA) of an optimal witness. We point out the possibility
of treating the entanglement witnesses on a complex Hilbert space as a subset of the witnesses on
a real Hilbert space.
