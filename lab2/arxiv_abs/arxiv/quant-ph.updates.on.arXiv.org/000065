BosonSampling, which we proposed three years ago, is a scheme for using linear-optical networks
to solve sampling problems that appear to be intractable for a classical computer. In arXiv:1306.3995
, Gogolin et al. claimed that even an ideal BosonSampling device's output would be "operationally
indistinguishable" from a uniform random outcome, at least "without detailed a priori knowledge";
or at any rate, that telling the two apart might itself be a hard problem. We first answer these claims---explaining
why the first is based on a definition of "a priori knowledge" so strange that, were it adopted, almost
no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure random-number source; while the second
is neither new nor a practical obstacle to interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we
then go further, and address some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.'s mistaken
arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random matrix A, the BosonSampling
distribution induced by A is far from the uniform distribution in total variation distance. More
surprisingly, and directly counter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes
these two distributions with constant bias. Finally, we offer three "bonus" results about BosonSampling.
First, we report a striking result due to Brandao: that one can efficiently sample a distribution
that is indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by any circuit of fixed polynomial
size. Second, we show that BosonSampling distributions can be efficiently distinguished from
uniform even with photon losses and for general initial states. Third, we offer the simplest known
proof that FermionSampling is solvable in classical polynomial time, and we reuse techniques from
our BosonSampling analysis to characterize random FermionSampling distributions.
