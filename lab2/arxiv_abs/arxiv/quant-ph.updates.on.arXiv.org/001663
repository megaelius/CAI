We review various theoretical methods that have been used in recent years to calculate dynamical
correlation functions of many-body systems. Time-dependent correlation functions and their
associated frequency spectral densities are the quantities of interest, for they play a central
role in both the theoretical and experimental understanding of dynamic properties. The calculation
of the relaxation function is rather difficult in most cases of interest, except for a few examples
where exact analytic expressions are allowed. For most of systems of interest approximation schemes
must be used. The method of recurrence relation has, at its foundation, the solution of Heisenberg
equation of motion of an operator in a many-body interacting system. Insights have been gained from
theorems that were discovered with that method. For instance, the absence of pure exponential behavior
for the relaxation functions of any Hamiltonian system. The method of recurrence relations was
used in quantum systems such as dense electron gas, transverse Ising model, Heisenberg model, XY
model, Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as classical harmonic
oscillator chains. Effects of disorder were considered in some of those systems. In the cases where
analytical solutions were not feasible, approximation schemes were used, but are highly model-dependent.
Another important approach is the numerically exact diagonalization method. It is used in finite-sized
systems, which sometimes provides very reliable information of the dynamics at the infinite-size
limit. In this work, we discuss the most relevant applications of the method of recurrence relations
and numerical calculations based on exact diagonalizations.
