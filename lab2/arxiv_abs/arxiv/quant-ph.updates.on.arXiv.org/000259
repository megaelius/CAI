Hybrid systems of laser-cooled trapped ions and ultracold atoms combined in a single experimental
setup have recently emerged as a new platform for fundamental research in quantum physics. This
paper reviews the theoretical and experimental progress in research on cold hybrid ion-atom systems
which aim to combine the best features of the two well-established fields. We provide a broad overview
of the theoretical description of ion-atom mixtures and their applications, and report on advances
in experiments with ions trapped in Paul or dipole traps overlapped with a cloud of cold atoms, and
with ions directly produced in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We start with microscopic models describing
the electronic structure, interactions, and collisional physics of ion-atom systems at low and
ultralow temperatures, including radiative and non-radiative charge transfer processes and
their control with magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances. Then we describe the relevant experimental
techniques and the intrinsic properties of hybrid systems. In particular, we discuss the impact
of the micromotion of ions in Paul traps on ion-atom hybrid systems. Next, we review recent proposals
for using ions immersed in ultracold gases for studying cold collisions, chemistry, many-body
physics, quantum simulation, and quantum computation and their experimental realizations. In
the last part we focus on the formation of molecular ions via spontaneous radiative association,
photoassociation, magnetoassociation, and sympathetic cooling. We discuss applications and
prospects of cold molecular ions for cold controlled chemistry and precision spectroscopy.
