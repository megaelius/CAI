The central idea of this work is the concept of prespace, a hypothetical structure that is postulated
to underlie the fabric of space or space-time. I consider how such a structure could relate to space
and space-time, and the implications of the existence of this structure for quantum theory. I compare
space and space-time to other spaces used in physics, such as configuration space, phase space,
and Hilbert space. I support the 'property view' of space, opposing both the traditional views of
space and space-time, substantivalism and relationism. I argue that configuration space has a
special status in the microscopic world similar to the status of position space in the macroscopic
world. The prespace structure is compared with a computational system, in particular to a cellular
automaton, in which space and all physical quantities are broken into discrete units. One way open
for a prespace metaphysics can be found if physics is made fully discrete. I suggest as a heuristic
principle that the physical laws of our world are such that the computational cost of implementing
those laws on an arbitrary computational system is minimized. I discuss the 'measurement problem'
of quantum mechanics. Considering how quantum theory could be made fully discrete leads naturally
to a suggestion of how standard linear quantum mechanics could be modified to give a solution to the
measurement problem, calling this model Critical Complexity Quantum Mechanics (CCQM). I compare
CCQM with some other proposed solutions to the measurement problem, in particular, the spontaneous
localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber. Finally, I argue that the measure of the complexity
of quantum mechanical states introduced in CCQM also provides a new definition of entropy for quantum
mechanics, and suggests an objective foundation for statistical mechanics, thermodynamics,
and the arrow of time.
