In the few-photon regime, we theoretically propose a feasible scheme to realize strong coupling
optomechanical cycle in a three-mode optomechanical circulatory system (OMCS) comprising of
cross-Kerr (CK) type and linear coupling between the corresponding two bosonic modes, meanwhile,
where one of the bosonic modes is strongly coherently driven and the rest are weakly driven. A Langevin
equation for strong three-mode OMCS is derived by adjusting the parameters of the appropriate strong
coherent laser. We show that this strong coupling of optomechanical originates from the strong
coherently driven the CK coupling modes, thereby, in coherent state displacement representation
enhance the optomechanical coupling and present the strengthen of the nonolinearity. We obtain
a set of optimal parameters by full numerical simulation of dynamics matrix, under this condition,
minimal strong OMCS that exhibit a single photon perfect non-reciprocal transmission between
the two optical modes, and unidirectional transportation inter the optomechanical modes. For
a detection field, the system presents optomechanical induced transparency (OMIT) behavior.
The presented results can be widely applied to quantum devices such as circulators, diodes, and
transistors. Moreover, we brief analysis that a system which consisting of dual mechanical modes
and one optical mode, further extend the system to a generalized coupled one-dimensional optomechanical
array and arbitrary modes optomechanical loop network. Experimentally, the system has been demonstrated
to be achieved through a variety of experimental protocols and configurations, for example optomechanical
crystal and integrated quantum superconducting circuit.
