In this paper, we will discuss a formal link between neural networks and quantum computing. For that
purpose we will present a simple model for the description of the neural network by forming sub-graphs
of the whole network with the same or a similar state. We will describe the interaction between these
areas by closed loops, the feedback loops. The change of the graph is given by the deformations of
the loops. This fact can be mathematically formalized by the fundamental group of the graph. Furthermore
the neuron has two basic states $|0\rangle$ (ground state) and $|1\rangle$ (excited state). The
whole state of an area of neurons is the linear combination of the two basic state with complex coefficients
representing the signals (with 3 Parameters: amplitude, frequency and phase) along the neurons.
Then it can be shown that the set of all signals forms a manifold (character variety) and all properties
of the network must be encoded in this manifold. In the paper, we will discuss how to interpret learning
and intuition in this model. Using the Morgan-Shalen compactification, the limit for signals with
large amplitude can be analyzed by using quasi-Fuchsian groups as represented by dessins d'enfants
(graphs to analyze Riemannian surfaces). As shown by Planat and collaborators, these dessins d'enfants
are a direct bridge to (topological) quantum computing with permutation groups. The normalization
of the signal reduces to the group $SU(2)$ and the whole model to a quantum network. Then we have a direct
connection to quantum circuits. This network can be transformed into operations on tensor networks.
Formally we will obtain a link between machine learning and Quantum computing.
