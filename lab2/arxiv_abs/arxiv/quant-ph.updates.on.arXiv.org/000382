The low-temperature limit of charge qubit decoherence due to its Coulomb interaction with electrons
tunneling through Luttinger liquid quantum-point contact (QPC) is investigated. The study is
focused on quantum detector properties of Luttinger liquid QPC. Efficiency of Luttinger liquid
qurrent-carrying quantum point-contact (QPC) as quantum detector for the coupled charge qubit
quantum state is characterized by the ratio of decoherence time and the acquisition of information
time and how both depend on electron-electron interaction has remained an interesting open question.
Here this question is answered in its most challenging zero- (and near zero-) temperature realization
where the latter two characteristic time-scales, both tends to zero shadowing true picture of quantum
detection in the zero-temperature limit. In order to resolve this difficulty two important mathematical
statements (S-theorem and S-lemma) have been proven here for the first time. As the result, it was
established here that low-temperature properties of QPC quantum detector with 1D electrodes are
defined explicitly by the competition between two different time-scales those reflecting two
different types of physical processes in the system. These processes are: i) the orthogonality
catastrophe-type decoherence of charge-qubit, one is analogous to the decay of Kondo-resonance
narrowed by QPC plasmons; ii) Kane-Fisher suppression of the electron tunneling through Luttinger
liquid QPC resulting in the divergence of electron tunneling time. In particular, it has been found
that at temperatures close to zero there exists a certain well-defined threshold value $ g=g_{cr}
$ of Luttinger liquid correlation parameter which serves as a sharp boundary between region of good
(or even perfect) quantum detection at $ g<g_{cr} $ and the region of quantum detector break down
where $ g>g_{cr} $.
