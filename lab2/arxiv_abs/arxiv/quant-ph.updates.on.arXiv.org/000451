The observation of an unequivocal quantum speedup remains an elusive objective for quantum computing.
The D-Wave quantum annealing processors have been at the forefront of experimental attempts to
address this goal, given their relatively large numbers of qubits and programmability. A complete
determination of the optimal time-to-solution (TTS) using these processors has not been possible
to date, preventing definitive conclusions about the presence of a scaling advantage. The main
technical obstacle has been the inability to verify an optimal annealing time within the available
range. Here we overcome this obstacle and present a class of problem instances for which we observe
an optimal annealing time using a D-Wave 2000Q processor over a range spanning up to more than $2000$
qubits. This allows us to perform an optimal TTS benchmarking analysis and perform a comparison
to several classical algorithms, including simulated annealing, spin-vector Monte Carlo, and
discrete-time simulated quantum annealing. We establish the first example of a scaling advantage
for an experimental quantum annealer over classical simulated annealing: we find that the D-Wave
device exhibits certifiably better scaling than simulated annealing, with $95\%$ confidence,
over the range of problem sizes that we can test. However, we do not find evidence for a quantum speedup:
simulated quantum annealing exhibits the best scaling by a significant margin. Our construction
of instance classes with verifiably optimal annealing times opens up the possibility of generating
many new such classes, paving the way for further definitive assessments of scaling advantages
using current and future quantum annealing devices.
