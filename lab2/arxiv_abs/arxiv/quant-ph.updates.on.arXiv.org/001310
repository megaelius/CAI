Although many different entanglement measures have been proposed so far, much less is known in the
multipartite case, which leads to the previous monogamy relations in literatures are not complete.
We establish here a strict framework for defining multipartite entanglement measure (MEM): apart
from the postulates of bipartite measure, a genuine MEM should additionally satisfy the unification
condition and the hierarchy condition. We then come up with a complete monogamy formula for the unified
MEM and a tightly complete monogamy relation for the genuine MEM. Consequently, we propose MEMs
which are multipartite extensions of entanglement of formation (EoF), concurrence, tangle, Tsallis
$q$-entropy of entanglement, R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy of entanglement, the convex-roof extension
of negativity and negativity, respectively. We show that (i) the extensions of EoF, concurrence,
tangle, and Tsallis $q$-entropy of entanglement are genuine MEMs, (ii) multipartite extensions
of R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy of entanglement, negativity and the convex-roof extension of negativity
are unified MEMs but not genuine MEMs, and (iii) all these multipartite extensions are completely
monogamous and the ones which are defined by the convex-roof structure (except for the R\'{e}nyi
$\alpha$-entropy of entanglement and the convex-roof extension of negativity) are not only completely
monogamous but also tightly completely monogamous. In addition, we find a class of tripartite states
that one part can maximally entangled with other two parts simultaneously according to the definition
of maximally entangled mixed state (MEMS) in [Quantum Inf. Comput. 12, 0063 (2012)]. Consequently,
we improve the definition of maximally entangled state (MES) and prove that there is no MEMS and that
the only MES is the pure MES.
