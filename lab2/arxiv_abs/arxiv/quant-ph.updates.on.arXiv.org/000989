We explore a variational Ansatz for lattice quantum systems -- named long-range entangled-plaquette
state -- in which pairs of clusters of adjacent lattice sites are correlated at any distance. The
explicit scale-free structure of correlations built in this wave function makes it fit to reproduce
critical states with long-range entanglement. The use of complex weights in the Ansatz allows for
an efficient optimization of non positive definite states in a fully variational fashion, namely
without any additional bias (arising \emph{e.g.} from pre-imposed sign structures) beyond that
imposed by the parametrization of the state coefficients. These two features render the Ansatz
particularly appropriate for the study of quantum phase transitions in frustrated systems. Moreover,
the Ansatz can be systematically improved by increasing the long range plaquette size, as well as
by the inclusion of even larger adjacent-site plaquettes. We validate our Ansatz in the case of the
XX and Heisenberg chain, and further apply it to the case of a simple, yet paradigmatic model of frustration,
namely the $J_1-J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. For this model we provide clear evidence
that our trial wave function faithfully describes both the short-range physics (particularly
in terms of ground state energy) and the long-range one expressed by the Luttinger exponent, and
the central charge of the related conformal field theory, which govern the decay of correlations
and the scaling of the entanglement entropy, respectively. Finally we successfully reproduce
the incommensurate correlations developing in the system at strong frustration, as a result of
the flexible representation of sign (phase) structures via complex weights.
