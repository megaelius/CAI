Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) is an attractive paradigm for solving hard integer polynomial
optimization problems. Available hardware restricts the Hamiltonians to be of a structure that
allows only pairwise interactions. This requires that the original optimization problem to be
first converted -- from its polynomial form -- to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
(QUBO) problem, which we frame as a problem in algebraic geometry. Additionally, the hardware graph
where such a QUBO-Hamiltonian needs to be embedded -- assigning variables of the problem to the qubits
of the physical optimizer -- is not a complete graph, but rather one with limited connectivity. This
"problem graph to hardware graph" embedding can also be framed as a problem of computing a Groebner
basis of a certain specially constructed polynomial ideal. We develop a systematic computational
approach to prepare a given polynomial optimization problem for AQC in three steps. The first step
reduces an input polynomial optimization problem into a QUBO through the computation of the Groebner
basis of a toric ideal generated from the monomials of the input objective function. The second step
computes feasible embeddings. The third step computes the spectral gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian
associated to a given embedding. These steps are applicable well beyond the integer polynomial
optimization problem. Our paper provides the first general purpose computational procedure that
can be used directly as a $translator$ to solve polynomial integer optimization. Alternatively,
it can be used as a test-bed (with small size problems) to help design efficient heuristic quantum
compilers by studying various choices of reductions and embeddings in a systematic and comprehensive
manner. An added benefit of our framework is in designing Ising architectures through the study
of $\mathcal Y-$minor universal graphs.
