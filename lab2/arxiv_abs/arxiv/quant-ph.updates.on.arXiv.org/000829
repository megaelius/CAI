We present a quantum algorithm for calculating the molecular vibronic spectrum of a molecule, using
the quantum circuit model. Both zero- and finite-temperature algorithms are described. The algorithm
outputs the Franck-Condon profile with the inclusion of Duschinsky effects, a common chemical
problem that scales combinatorially on a classical computer. Previous quantum computation proposals
for simulating the same problem have focused on the use of a boson sampling device, while ours instead
makes use of the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm on a universal quantum computer. Our strategy
is used to efficiently converge to the spectrum that represents the Franck-Condon profile. Our
approach provides several potential advantages over previous quantum-based proposals for this
problem: after measuring the transition energy, the quantum state is preserved for further analysis;
anharmonicity is naturally taken into account with polynomial overhead; we potentially circumvent
the difficulty of accurately detecting large photon numbers in boson sampling devices; and error-correction
is in principle possible for our algorithm. As classical algorithms for modeling anharmonic effects
are computationally very expensive, we expect the most significant quantum advantage to appear
when modeling molecules with substantial anharmonicity. Finally, we numerically study the effects
of truncation errors in four real triatomic molecules. Future universal quantum computers running
this algorithm will be able to speed up the process of characterizing and designing molecules and
materials with specific light-absorption and energy transfer properties, as well as aiding the
interpretation of spectroscopy experiments. This algorithmic strategy, of calculating spectra
to arbitrary precision using quantum phase estimation, is applicable to other problems of interest
in chemistry and condensed matter physics.
