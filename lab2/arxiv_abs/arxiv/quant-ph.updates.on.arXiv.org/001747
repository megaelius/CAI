Open quantum many body systems describe several quantum simulators, ranging from arrays of superconducting
circuits hosting correlated states of light, to ultracold atoms in optical lattices in presence
of controlled dissipative processes. Their theoretical understanding is hampered by the exponential
scaling of their Hilbert space and by their intrinsic nonequilibrium nature, limiting the applicability
of many traditional approaches. In this work we extend Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT), a powerful
nonperturbative technique developed for strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, to Markovian
open quantum systems. Within Open-DMFT, a master equation describing a lattice of bosonic particles
is mapped, at large but finite connectivity, onto an impurity problem describing a single site coupled
to Markovian and non-Markovian environments, where the latter accounts for quantum fluctuations
beyond Gutzwiller mean-field theory. We introduce a new non-perturbative approach to solve the
impurity problem, which dresses the impurity, featuring Markovian dissipative channels, with
the non-Markovian bath, in a self-consistent scheme based on a resummation of non-crossing diagrams.
Finally, we apply our Open-DMFT to solve a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, which is relevant
to current experiments with dissipative ultracold bosons. We show that this model undergoes a dissipative
phase transition towards a superfluid phase, which can be equally interpreted as a quantum many-body
synchronization transition of an array of quantum van der Pol oscillators. We show how Open-DMFT
captures crucial effects due to finite lattice connectivity, such as hopping-induced dissipation
and heating, which are completely missed by mean field theories and which lead to a drastic reduction
of the broken symmetry phase that we interpret as a desynchronization driven by quantum fluctuations.
