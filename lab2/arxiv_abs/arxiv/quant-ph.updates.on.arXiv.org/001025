Following detailed analysis of relativistic, QED and mass corrections for helium-like and lithium-like
ions with static nuclei for $Z \leq 20$ the domain of applicability of Non-Relativistic QED (NRQED)
is localized for ground state energy. It is demonstrated that for both helium-like and lithium-like
ions with $Z \leq 20$ the finite nuclear mass effects do not change 4-5 significant digits (s.d.)
and the leading relativistic and QED effects leave unchanged 3-4 s.d. in the ground state energy.
It is shown that the non-relativistic ground state energy can be interpolated with accuracy of not
less than 6 decimal digits (d.d.) for helium-like and for lithium-like ions for $Z \leq 20$ by a meromorphic
function in variable ${\lambda}=\sqrt{Z-{Z_B}}$ (here $Z_B$ is the 2nd critical charge \cite{TLO:2016}),
which is well inside the domain of applicability of NRQED. It is found that both the Majorana formula
- a second degree polynomial in $Z$ with two free parameters - and a fourth degree polynomial in ${\lambda}$
(a generalization of the Majorana formula) reproduce the ground state energy of the helium-like
and lithium-like ions for $Z \leq 20$ in the domain of applicability of NRQED, thus, at least, 3 s.d.
It is noted that $\gtrsim 99.9\%$ of the ground state energy is given by the variational energy for
properly optimized trial function of the form of (anti)-symmetrized product of three (six) screened
Coulomb orbitals for two-(three) electron system with 3 (7) free parameters for $Z \leq 20$, respectively.
It may imply that these trial functions are, in fact, {\it exact} wavefunctions in non-relativistic
QED, thus, the NRQED effective potential can be derived. It is shown that the sum of relativistic
and QED effects in leading approximation - 3 s.d. - for both 2 and 3 electron systems is interpolated
by 4th degree polynomial in $Z$ for $Z \leq 20$.
