We show that it is possible to construct a preparation non-contextual ontological model that does
not exhibit "transformation contextuality" for single qubits in the stabilizer subtheory. In
particular, we consider the "blowtorch" map and show that it does not exhibit transformation contextuality
under the Grassmann Wigner-Weyl-Moyal (WWM) qubit formalism. Furthermore, the transformation
in this formalism can be fully expressed at order $\hbar^0$ and so does not qualify as a candidate
quantum phenomenon. In particular, we find that the Grassmann WWM formalism at order $\hbar^0$
corresponds to an ontological model governed by an additional set of constraints arising from the
relations defining the Grassmann algebra. Due to this additional set of constraints, the allowed
probability distributions in this model do not form a single convex set when expressed in terms of
disjoint ontic states and so cannot be mapped to models whose states form a single convex set over
disjoint ontic states. However, expressing the Grassmann WWM ontological model in terms of non-disjoint
ontic states corresponding to the monomials of the Grassmann algebra results in a single convex
set. We further show that a recent result by Lillystone et al. that proves a broad class of preparation
and measurement non-contextual ontological models must exhibit transformation contextuality
lacks the generality to include the ontological model considered here; Lillystone et al.'s result
is appropriately limited to ontological models whose states produce a single convex set when expressed
in terms of disjoint ontic states. Therefore, we prove that for the qubit stabilizer subtheory to
be captured by a preparation, transformation and measurement non-contextual ontological theory,
it must be expressed in terms of non-disjoint ontic states, unlike the case for the odd-dimensional
single-qudit stabilizer subtheory.
