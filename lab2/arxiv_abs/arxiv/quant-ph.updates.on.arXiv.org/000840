In the domain of few-body physics, the laws of quantum mechanics allow formation of peculiar loosely
bound states. Being insensitive to the details of the short range inter-particle interactions,
they display a variety of universal properties. In recent years ultracold atoms emerged as a main
experimental platform to explore universality in few-body systems. In the two-body domain, weakly
bound dimers are now routinely used for the characterization of Feshbach resonances and serve as
the initial state for the production of ultra-cold molecules in their ro-vibrational ground state.
In the three-body domain, the captivating subject of Efimov-related physics has been explored
in a variety of atomic systems. But, interestingly, experimental techniques used in these explorations
have been limited to the study of inter-atomic inelastic processes, such as three-body recombination.
Such an approach is best suited for the region of negative scattering lengths, where trimers can
be associated from the three-atom continuum. In contrast, for positive scattering lengths the
presence of dimers shifts the association related loss features into the atom-dimer continuum
and Efimov resonances remain inaccessible for direct observation. Here we demonstrate a powerful
experimental approach which turns the presence of the dimers into an advantage. We use them as a local
reference for Efimov trimers by creating a coherent superposition of both states. Measurement
of its coherent evolution provides information on the binding energy of the trimers with unprecedented
precision. Even more importantly, it yields access to previously inaccessible parameters of the
system such as the Efimov trimers' lifetime and the elastic processes between atoms and the constituents
of the superposition state. Thus, our technique opens a new perspective on Efimov physics in a broad
domain, where the main open questions persist.
