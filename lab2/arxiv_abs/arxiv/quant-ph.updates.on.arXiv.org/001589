Anyon models are algebraic structures that model universal topological properties in topological
phases of matter and can be regarded as mathematical characterization of topological order in two
spacial dimensions. It is conjectured that every anyon model, or mathematically unitary modular
tensor category, can be realized as the representation category of some chiral conformal field
theory, or mathematically vertex operator algebra/local conformal net. This conjecture is known
to be true for abelian anyon models providing support for the conjecture. We reexamine abelian anyon
models from several different angles. First anyon models are algebraic data for both topological
quantum field theories and chiral conformal field theories. While it is known that each abelian
anyon model can be realized by a quantum abelian Chern-Simons theory and chiral conformal field
theory, the construction is not algorithmic. Our goal is to provide such an explicit algorithm for
a $K$-matrix in Chern-Simons theory and a positive definite even one for a lattice conformal field
theory. Secondly anyon models and chiral conformal field theories underlie the bulk-edge correspondence
for topological phases of matter. But there are interesting subtleties in this correspondence
when stability of the edge theory and topological symmetry are taken into consideration. Therefore,
our focus is on the algorithmic reconstruction of extremal chiral conformal field theories with
small central charges. Finally we conjecture that a much stronger reconstruction holds for abelian
anyon models: every abelian anyon model can be realized as the representation category of some non-lattice
extremal vertex operator algebra generalizing the moonshine realization of the trivial anyon
model.
