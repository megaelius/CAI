We explore the quantum Coulomb problem for two-body bound states, in $D=3$ and $D=3-2\epsilon$
dimensions, in detail, and give an extensive list of expectation values that arise in the evaluation
of QED corrections to bound state energies. We describe the techniques used to obtain these expectation
values and give general formulas for the evaluation of integrals involving associated Laguerre
polynomials. In addition, we give formulas for the evaluation of integrals involving subtracted
associated Laguerre polynomials--those with low powers of the variable subtracted off--that
arise when evaluating divergent expectation values. We present perturbative results (in the parameter
$\epsilon$) that show how bound state energies and wave functions in $D=3-2\epsilon$ dimensions
differ from their $D=3$ dimensional counterparts and use these formulas to find regularized expressions
for divergent expectation values such as $\big \langle \bar V^3 \big \rangle$ and $\big \langle
(\bar V')^2 \big \rangle$ where $\bar V$ is the $D$-dimensional Coulomb potential. We evaluate
a number of finite $D$-dimensional expectation values such as $\big \langle r^{-2+4\epsilon}
\partial_r^2 \big \rangle$ and $\big \langle r^{4\epsilon} p^4 \big \rangle$ that have $\epsilon
\rightarrow 0$ limits that differ from their three-dimensional counterparts $\big \langle r^{-2}
\partial_r^2 \big \rangle$ and $\big \langle p^4 \big \rangle$. We explore the use of recursion
relations, the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, and momentum space brackets combined with $D$-dimensional
Fourier transformation for the evaluation of $D$-dimensional expectation values. The results
of this paper are useful when using dimensional regularization in the calculation of properties
of Coulomb bound systems.
