We analyze the fundamental quantum limit of the resolution of an optical imaging system from the
perspective of the detection problem of deciding whether the optical field in the image plane is
generated by one incoherent on-axis source with brightness $\epsilon$ or by two $\epsilon/2$-brightness
incoherent sources that are symmetrically disposed about the optical axis. Using the exact thermal-state
model of the field, we derive the quantum Chernoff bound for the detection problem, which specifies
the optimum rate of decay of the error probability with increasing number of collected photons that
is allowed by quantum mechanics. We then show that recently proposed linear-optic schemes approach
the quantum Chernoff bound---the method of binary spatial-mode demultiplexing (B-SPADE) is quantum-optimal
for all values of separation, while a method using image-inversion interferometry (SLIVER) is
near-optimal for sub-Rayleigh separations. We then simplify our model using a low-brightness
approximation that is very accurate for optical microscopy and astronomy, derive quantum Chernoff
bounds conditional on the number of photons detected, and show the optimality of our schemes in this
conditional detection paradigm. For comparison, we analytically demonstrate the superior scaling
of the Chernoff bound for our schemes with source separation relative to that of spatially-resolved
direct imaging. Our schemes have the advantages over the quantum-optimal (Helstrom) measurement
in that they do not involve joint measurements over multiple modes, and that they do not require the
angular separation for the two-source hypothesis to be given \emph{a priori} and can offer that
information as a bonus in the event of a successful detection.
