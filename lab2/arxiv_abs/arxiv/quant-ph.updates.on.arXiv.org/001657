Quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson junction-based
superconducting circuits in the 1980's. In the last twenty years, the emergence of quantum information
science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information
processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably
interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting
circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of
this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the
latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED
allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented
detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to quantum information processing
with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED enables the study of hybrid quantum systems
interacting with microwave photons. Here, we review the coherent coupling of superconducting
qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focussing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings
model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system.
We discuss coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent
control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive
qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following
an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, we discuss important
use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics.
