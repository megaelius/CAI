This is a tutorial review of methods to braid the world lines of non-Abelian anyons (Majorana zero-modes)
in topological superconductors. That "Holy Grail" of topological quantum information processing
has not yet been reached in the laboratory, but there now exists a variety of platforms in which one
can search for the Majorana braiding statistics. After an introduction to the basic concepts of
braiding we discuss how one might be able to braid immobile Majorana zero-modes, bound to the end
points of a nanowire, by performing the exchange in parameter space, rather than in real space. We
explain how Coulomb interaction can be used to both control and read out the braiding operation,
even though Majorana zero-modes are charge neutral. We ask whether the fusion rule might provide
for an easier pathway towards the demonstration of non-Abelian statistics. In the final part we
discuss an approach to braiding in real space, rather than parameter space, using vortices injected
into a chiral Majorana edge mode as "flying qubits". Contents: I. Introduction II. Basic Concepts
