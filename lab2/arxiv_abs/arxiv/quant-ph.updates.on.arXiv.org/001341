Discrimination between quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information theory. Given
two arbitrary tensor-product quantum states (TPQS) $\rho_{\pm} = \rho_{\pm}^{(1)} \otimes \cdots
\otimes \rho_{\pm}^{(N)}$, determining the joint $N$-system measurement to optimally distinguish
between the two states is a hard problem. Thus, there is great interest in identifying local measurement
schemes that are optimal or close-to-optimal. In this work, we focus on distinguishing between
two general TPQS. We begin by generalizing previous work by Acin et al. (Phys. Rev. A 71, 032338) to
show that a locally greedy (LG) scheme using Bayesian updating can optimally distinguish between
two states that can be written as tensor products of arbitrary pure states. Then, we show that even
in the limit of large $N$ the same algorithm cannot distinguish tensor products of mixed states with
vanishing error probability. This poor asymptotic behavior occurs because the Helstrom measurement
becomes trivial for sufficiently biased priors. Based on this, we introduce a modified locally
greedy (MLG) scheme with strictly better performance. In the second part of this work, we compare
these simple local schemes with a general dynamic programming (DP) approach that finds the optimal
series of local measurements to distinguish the two states. When the subsystems are non-identical,
we demonstrate that the ordering of the systems affects performance and we extend the DP technique
to determine the optimal ordering adaptively. Finally, in contrast to the binary optimal collective
measurement, we show that adaptive protocols on sufficiently large (e.g., qutrit) subsystems
must contain non-binary measurements to be optimal. (The code that produced the simulation results
