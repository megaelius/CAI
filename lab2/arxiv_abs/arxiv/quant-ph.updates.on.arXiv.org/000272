Quantum information technologies, and intelligent learning systems, are both emergent technologies
that will likely have a transforming impact on our society. The respective underlying fields of
research -- quantum information (QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) -- have their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently.
However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question to what extent
these fields can learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum
computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the
problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both directions of influence.
For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical
in our "big data" world. Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become
instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis,
or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been
demonstrated for interactive learning, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning
agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for
performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond
the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum
generalizations of ML/AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and
intelligence in a world that is described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main
ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine
learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.
