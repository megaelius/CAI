The reduced dynamics of an open quantum system obtained from an underlying microscopic Hamiltonian
can in general only approximately be described by a time local master equation. The quality of that
approximation depends primarily on the coupling strength and the structure of the environment.
Various such master equations have been proposed with different aims. Here we want to compare some
of them focusing on the accuracy of the reduced dynamics. We use two qubits coupled to a Lorentzian
environment in a spin-boson like fashion modeling a generic situation with various system and bath
time scales. We see that, independent of the initial state, the simple Redfield Equation with time
dependent coefficients yields significantly better results than other methods. Notably, we confirm
that the known positivity problems of the Redfield Equation become relevant only in a regime where
the underlying approximations are no longer valid, anyway. This implies that the loss of positivity
should in fact be welcomed as an important feature: it indicates the breakdown of the weak coupling
assumption. Further, we discuss how the Coarse-Grained Master Equation with a suitably chosen
coarse graining time, and a related Dynamical Map -- two methods guaranteeing positivity of the
reduced state -- can improve on the widely used rotating wave approximation required for the standard
Quantum Optical Master Equation. In particular, we show that for a short bath correlation time,
the Coarse-Grained Master Equation outperforms the Quantum Optical Master Equation significantly
in the regime of stronger coupling, irrespective of the system Hamiltonian.
