In quantum physics the free particle and the harmonically trapped particle are arguably the most
important systems a physicist needs to know about. It is little known that, mathematically, they
are one and the same. This knowledge helps us to understand either from the viewpoint of the other.
Here we show that all general time-dependent solutions of the free-particle Schroedinger equation
can be mapped to solutions of the Schroedinger equation for harmonic potentials, both the trapping
oscillator and the inverted 'oscillator'. This map is fully invertible and therefore induces an
isomorphism between both types of system, they are equivalent. A composition of the map and its inverse
allows us to map from one harmonic oscillator to another with a different spring constant and different
center position. The map is independent of the state of the system, consisting only of a coordinate
transformation and multiplication by a form factor, and can be chosen such that the state is identical
in both systems at one point in time. This transition point in time can be chosen freely, the wave function
of the particle evolving in time in one system before the transition point can therefore be linked
up smoothly with the wave function for the other system and its future evolution after the transition
point. Such a cut-and-paste procedure allows us to describe the instantaneous changes of the environment
a particle finds itself in. Transitions from free to trapped systems, between harmonic traps of
different spring constants or center positions, or, from harmonic binding to repulsive harmonic
potentials are straightforwardly modelled. This includes some time-dependent harmonic potentials.
The mappings introduced here are computationally more efficient than either state-projection
or harmonic oscillator propagator techniques conventionally employed when describing instantaneous
