It is known that several sub-universal quantum computing models cannot be classically simulated
in polynomial-time unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses. These results, however,
do not rule out possibilities of exponential- or sub-exponential-time classical simulations.
In this paper, we study fine-grained quantum computational supremacy that excludes superpolynomial-time
classical simulations. We first consider the DQC1 model. We show that for any $a>0$ output probability
distributions of the $N$-qubit DQC1 model cannot be classically sampled within a constant multiplicative
error and in $2^{(1-a)N+o(N)}$ time (under certain conjectures in fine-grained complexity theory).
We next show similar fine-grained quantum supremacy results for the HC1Q model, which is another
sub-universal model with a classical circuit sandwiched by two Hadamard layers. Finally, we also
consider universal quantum computing with Clifford and $T$ gates. We first show that under the exponential-time
hypothesis (ETH), output probability distributions of Clifford-$T$ quantum computing cannot
be calculated in $2^{o(t)}$ time within an additive error smaller than $2^{-\frac{3t+14}{7}}$,
where $t$ is the number of $T$ gates. We next show that under another fine-grained complexity conjecture,
output probability distributions of Clifford-$T$ quantum computing cannot be classically sampled
in $2^{o(t)}$ time within a constant multiplicative error. There is a classical algorithm that
calculates output probability distributions of Clifford-$T$ quantum computing within a constant
multiplicative error in $\sim2^{\beta t}$ time with a non-trivial factor $\beta\simeq0.47$ [S.
Bravyi and D. Gosset, Physical Review Letters 116, 250501 (2016)]. Our second result on Clifford-$T$
quantum computing therefore suggests that improving $2^{\beta t}$ to sub-exponential time, say
$2^{\sqrt{t}}$, is impossible.
