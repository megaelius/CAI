Contextuality - the inability to assign pre-existing outcomes to all potential measurements of
a quantum system - has been proposed as a resource that powers quantum computing. The measurement-based
model provides a concrete manifestation of contextuality as a computational resource, as follows.
If local measurements on a multi-qubit state can be used to evaluate non-linear boolean functions
with only linear control processing, then this computation constitutes a proof of contextuality
- the possible local measurement outcomes cannot all be pre-assigned. However, this connection
is restricted to the special case when the local measured systems are qubits, which have unusual
properties from the perspective of contextuality. A single qubit cannot allow for a proof of contextuality,
unlike higher-dimensional systems, and multiple qubits can allow for state-independent contextuality
with only Pauli observables, again unlike higher-dimensional generalisations. Here we identify
precisely which non-local features of contextuality are necessary in a qudit measurement-based
computation that evaluates high-degree polynomial functions with only linear control. We introduce
the concept of local universality, which places a bound on the space of output functions accessible
under the constraint of single-qudit measurements. Thus, the partition of a physical system into
subsystems plays a crucial role for the increase in computational power. A prominent feature of
our setting is that the enabling resources for qubit and qudit measurement-based computations
are of the same underlying nature, avoiding the pathologies associated with qubit contextuality.
