The non-extensibility of quantum theory into a theory with improved predictive power is based on
a strong assumption of independent free choice, in which the physicists pick a measurement axis
independently of anything that couldn't have been caused by their decision. Independent free choice
is also at the core of the Nash equilibrium and classical game theory. A more recent line of game-theoretical
research based on weakening free choice leads to non-trivial solution concepts with desirable
properties such as at-most uniqueness, Pareto optimality, and contextuality. We show how introducing
contingent free choice in the foundations of quantum theory yields a class of deterministic and
contextual theories with an improved predictive power, and contrast them with the pilot-wave theory.
Specifically, we suggest that quantum experiments, such as the EPR experiment, involving measurements
located in spacetime, can be recast as dynamic games with imperfect information involving human
agents and the universe. The underlying idea is that a physicist picking a measurement axis and the
universe picking a measurement outcome are two faces of the same physical contingency phenomenon.
The classical, Nashian resolution of these games based on independent free choice is analogous
to local hidden variable theories, constrained by the Bell inequalities. On the other hand, in a
setup in which agents are rational and omniscient in all possible worlds, under contingent free
choice, the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium provides a contextual resolution, based on the
iterated elimination of inconsistent worlds, towards an at-most unique possible world, in which
the outcomes of measurements that actually are carried out, and only them, are deterministically
defined.
