We study generic open quantum systems with Markovian dissipation, focusing on a class of stochastic
Liouvillian operators of Lindblad form with independent random dissipation channels (jump operators)
and a random Hamiltonian. We perform a thorough numerical study, focusing on global spectral features,
the spectral gap, and the steady-state purity and statistics. We establish that all properties
follow three different regimes as a function of the dissipation strength, whose boundaries depend
on the particular observable. Within each regime, we determine the scaling exponents with the dissipation
strength and system size. On the analytical side, we compute the average spectral gap at arbitrary
dissipation and provide simple closed-form expressions for the asymptotic values at strong and
weak dissipation strength. We also consider spectral correlations in generic complex spectra,
such as that of the Liouvillian. We introduce and study, both analytically and numerically, the
complex ratio of the nearest-neighbor spacing by next-to-nearest-neighbor spacing. Besides
the usual level repulsion, we find that complex spacing ratios have a nontrivial angular dependence
which offers a distinct signature of quantum chaos. It distinguishes integrable systems, which
support the flat ratio distribution characteristic of Poisson statistics, and chaotic dissipative
quantum systems, which conform to Random Matrix Theory statistics. We apply this new signature
of quantum chaos to random Liouvillians and boundary-driven dissipative spin-chains. The results
of this thesis can help understand the long-time dynamics, steady-state properties, and spectral
correlations of generic dissipative systems.
