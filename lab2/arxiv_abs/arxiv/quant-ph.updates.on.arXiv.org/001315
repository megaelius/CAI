We study a model of two coupled two-level atoms (qubits) interacting off-resonance (at non-zero
detuning) with a single mode radiation field. This system is of special interest in the field of quantum
information processing (QIP) and can be realized in electron spin states in quantum dots or Rydberg
atoms in optical cavities and superconducting qubits in linear resonators. We present an exact
analytical solution for the time evolution of the system starting from any initial state. Utilizing
this solution, we show how the entanglement sudden death (ESD), which represents a major threat
to QIP, can be efficiently controlled by tuning atom-atom coupling and non-zero detuning. We demonstrate
that while one of these two system parameters may not separately affect the ESD, combining the two
can be very effective, as in the case of an initial correlated Bell state. However in other cases,
such as a W-like initial state, they may have a competing impacts on ESD. Moreover, their combined
effect can be used to create ESD in the system as in the case of an anti-correlated initial Bell state.
A clear synchronization between the population inversion collapse-revival pattern and the entanglement
dynamics is observed at all system parameter combinations. Nevertheless, only for initial states
that may evolve to ESD, the population inversion revival oscillations, where exchange of energy
between the atoms and the field takes place, temporally coincide with the entanglement revival
peaks, whereas the population collapse periods match the ESD intervals. The variation of the radiation
field intensity has a clear impact on the duration of the ESD at any combination of the other system
parameters.
