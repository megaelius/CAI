The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a general-purpose algorithm for combinatorial
optimization problems whose performance can only improve with the number of layers $p$. While QAOA
holds promise as an algorithm that can be run on near-term quantum computers, its computational
power has not been fully explored. In this work, we study the QAOA applied to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
(SK) model, which can be understood as energy minimization of $n$ spins with all-to-all random signed
couplings. There is a recent classical algorithm by Montanari that can efficiently find an approximate
solution for a typical instance of the SK model to within $(1-\epsilon)$ times the ground state energy,
so we can only hope to match its performance with the QAOA. Our main result is a novel technique that
allows us to evaluate the typical-instance energy of the QAOA applied to the SK model. We produce
a formula for the expected value of the energy, as a function of the $2p$ QAOA parameters, in the infinite
size limit that can be evaluated on a computer with $O(16^p)$ complexity. We found optimal parameters
up to $p=8$ running on a laptop. Moreover, we show concentration: With probability tending to one
as $n\to\infty$, measurements of the QAOA will produce strings whose energies concentrate at our
calculated value. As an algorithm running on a quantum computer, there is no need to search for optimal
parameters on an instance-by-instance basis since we can determine them in advance. What we have
here is a new framework for analyzing the QAOA, and our techniques can be of broad interest for evaluating
its performance on more general problems.
