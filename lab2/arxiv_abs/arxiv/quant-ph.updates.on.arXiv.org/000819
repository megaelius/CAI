The entanglement and resonance energy transfer between two-level quantum emitters are typically
limited to sub-wavelength distances due to the inherently short-range nature of the dipole-dipole
interactions. Moreover, the entanglement of quantum systems is hard to preserve for a long period
of time due to decoherence and dephasing mainly caused by radiative and nonradiative losses. Recently,
nanoscale plasmonic waveguide systems have been proposed to tackle this problem to a certain degree.
In this work, we thoroughly investigate the efficient inter-emitter entanglement and large enhancement
of resonance energy transfer between two optical qubits mediated by epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) plasmonic
waveguides. We calculate the concurrence and the resonance energy transfer rate for the ENZ waveguide
and compare them to similar metrics for two other commonly used plasmonic waveguide systems, i.e.,
V-shaped groove milled in a flat metallic surface and cylindrical nanorod. We prove that the ENZ
waveguide drastically outperforms the other two waveguide types when it comes to improving the
entanglement and the resonant energy transfer. What is even more important, the efficiency of the
entanglement between the emitters does not depend on their position within the ENZ waveguide, as
the ENZ plasmonic mode has an infinite phase velocity combined with strong and homogeneous electric
field. Moreover, we demonstrate that efficient steady-state entanglement can be achieved by using
coherent external pumping and report a practical way to detect it by computing the second-order
correlation function. The presented results are expected to be useful for the future quantum communication
and information plasmonic nanodevices.
