We present a unified description of several methods of chiral discrimination based exclusively
on electric-dipole interactions. It includes photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD), enantio-sensitive
microwave spectroscopy (EMWS), photoexcitation circular dichroism (PXCD), and photoelectron-photoexcitation
circular dichroism (PXECD). We show that, in spite of the fact that the physics underlying the appearance
of a chiral response is very different in all these methods, the enantio-sensitive and dichroic
observable in all cases has a unique form. It is a polar vector given by the product of (i) a molecular
pseudoscalar and (ii) a field pseudovector specified by the configuration of the electric fields
interacting with the isotropic ensemble of chiral molecules. The molecular pseudoscalar is a rotationally
invariant property, which is composed from different molecule-specific vectors and in the simplest
case is a triple product of such vectors. The key property that enables the chiral response is the
non-coplanarity of the vectors forming such triple product. The key property that enables chiral
detection without relying on the chirality of the electromagnetic fields is the vectorial nature
of the enantio-sensitive observable. Our compact and general expression for this observable shows
what ultimately determines the efficiency of the chiral signal and if, or when, it can reach 100%.
We also discuss the differences between the two phenomena, which rely on the bound states, PXCD and
EMWS, and the two phenomena using the continuum states, PECD and PXECD. Finally, we extend these
methods to arbitrary polarizations of the electric fields used to induce and probe the chiral response.
