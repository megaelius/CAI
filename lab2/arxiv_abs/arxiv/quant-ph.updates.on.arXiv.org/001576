The standard quantum formalism introduced at the undergraduate level treats measurement as an
instantaneous collapse. In reality however, no physical process can occur over a truly infinitesimal
time interval. A more subtle investigation of open quantum systems lead to the theory of continuous
measurement and quantum trajectories, in which wave function collapse occurs over a finite time
scale associated with an interaction. Within this formalism, it becomes possible to ask many new
questions that would be trivial or even ill-defined in the context of the more basic measurement
model. In this thesis, we investigate both theoretically and experimentally what fundamentally
new capabilities arise when an experimental apparatus can resolve the continuous dynamics of a
measurement. Theoretically, we show that when one can perform feedback operations on the timescale
of the measurement process, the resulting tools provide significantly more control over entanglement
generation, and in some settings can generate it optimally. We derive these results using a novel
formalism which encompasses most known quantum feedback protocols. Experimentally, we show that
continuous measurement allows one to observe the dynamics of a system undergoing simultaneous
non-commuting measurements, which provides a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. Finally, we combine the theoretical focus on quantum feedback with the experimental
capabilities of superconducting circuits to implement a feedback controlled quantum amplifier.
The resulting system is capable of adaptive measurement, which we use to perform the first canonical
phase measurement.
