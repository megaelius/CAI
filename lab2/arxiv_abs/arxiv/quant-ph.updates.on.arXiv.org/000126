Algorithmic cooling (AC) is a method to purify quantum systems, such as ensembles of nuclear spins,
or cold atoms in an optical lattice. When applied to spins, AC produces ensembles of highly polarized
spins, which enhance the signal strength in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). According to this
cooling approach, spin-half nuclei in a constant magnetic field are considered as bits, or more
precisely, quantum bits, in a known probability distribution. Algorithmic steps on these bits
are then translated into specially designed NMR pulse sequences using common NMR quantum computation
tools. The $algorithmic$ cooling of spins is achieved by alternately combining reversible, entropy-preserving
manipulations (borrowed from data compression algorithms) with $selective$ $reset$, the transfer
of entropy from selected spins to the environment. In theory, applying algorithmic cooling to sufficiently
large spin systems may produce polarizations far beyond the limits due to conservation of Shannon
entropy. Here, only selective reset steps are performed, hence we prefer to call this process "heat-bath"
cooling, rather than algorithmic cooling. We experimentally implement here two consecutive steps
of selective reset that transfer entropy from two selected spins to the environment. We performed
such cooling experiments with commercially-available labeled molecules, on standard liquid-state
NMR spectrometers. Our experiments yielded polarizations that $bypass$ $Shannon's$ $entropy$-$conservation$
$bound$, so that the entire spin-system was cooled. This paper was initially submitted in 2005,
first to Science and then to PNAS, and includes additional results from subsequent years (e.g. for
resubmission in 2007). The Postscriptum includes more details.
