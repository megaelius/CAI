Wavefunction is the foundation of quantum theory, which is assumed to give a complete description
of a quantum system. For a long time, wavefunction is introduced as an abstract element of the theory
and there lacks effective ways to measure it directly. The situation, however, is somewhat changed
when Lundeen et al. reported the direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction via weak measurements,
which gives the wavefunction a clearly operational definition [Nature 474, 188 (2011)]. The weak
measurement method requires sequential measurements of conjugate observables position and momentum
with the position measurement is weak enough. Surprisingly, the recent research by Vallone and
Dequal shows that performing sequential strong measurements realizes the same target, in which
case no approximation has to be made compared to the case of weak measurements[Phys. Rev. Lett. 116,
040502 (2016)]. Here we experimentally report the direct measurement of the two-dimensional transverse
wavefunction of photons via strong measurements for the first time, which implies that an accurate
and clear operational definition can be given to wavefunction. We have measured the Gaussian and
Laguerre-Gaussian of l = 1 spatial wavefunctions of photons with R-square are 0.97 and 0.93 respectively.
As a potentially important application, we show that the direct measurement of two-dimensional
wavefunction provides an alternative way to realize digital holography of three-dimensional
objects. The results presented here will not only deepen our understanding of abstract wavefunction
but also have significant applications in quantum information processing and quantum imaging.
