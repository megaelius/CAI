We address the question of efficient implementation of quantum protocols, with short depth circuits
and small additional resource. We introduce two new methods in this direction. The first method,
inspired by the technique of classical correlated sampling, is to unitarily extend a given quantum
state into a quantum state uniform in a subspace. The second method involves two new versions of the
convex-split lemma that use exponentially small amount of additional resource in comparison to
the previous quantum version. Using these methods, we obtain the following results. First, we consider
the task of quantum decoupling on $n$ qubits. Most previous works achieve decoupling with the aid
of a random unitary followed by discarding some qubits. The random unitaries can be replaced by random
quantum circuits or unitary $2$ designs of size $O(n\log n)$ and depth $poly(\log n)$. We show that
given any choice of basis such as the computational basis, decoupling can be achieved by a unitary
that takes basis vectors to basis vectors. Thus, the circuit acts in a `classical' manner. Our unitary
performs addition and multiplication modulo a prime and hence achieves $O(n\log n)$ circuit size
and logarithmic depth. Next, we construct a new one-shot entanglement-assisted protocol for quantum
channel coding that achieves near-optimal communication through a given channel. The number of
qubits of entanglement used in this protocol is proportional to the number of qubits input to the
channel. Previous one-shot works were either near-optimal in communication but required exponentially
more entanglement, or required small amount of entanglement but did not achieve near-optimal communication.
We also achieve similar exponential improvement in the entanglement required for one-shot quantum
state redistribution, while keeping the communication similar to the best known achievable communication.
