Quantum Fisher information plays a central role in the field of quantum metrology. In this paper
we study the problem of quantum Fisher information of unitary processes. Associated to each parameter
$\theta_i$ of unitary process $U(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, there exists a unique Hermitian matrix
$M_{\theta_i}=i(U^\dagger\partial_{\theta_i} U)$. Except for some simple cases, such as when
the parameter under estimation is an overall multiplicative factor in the Hamiltonian, calculation
of these matrices is not an easy task to treat even for estimating a single parameter of qubit systems.
Using the Bloch vector $\boldsymbol{m}_{\theta_i}$, corresponding to each matrix $M_{\theta_i}$,
we find a closed relation for the quantum Fisher information matrix of the qubit systems for an arbitrary
number of estimation parameters. We extend our results and present an explicit relation for each
vector $\boldsymbol{m}_{\theta_i}$ for a general Hamiltonian with arbitrary parametrization.
We illustrate our results by obtaining the quantum Fisher matrix of the so-called angle-axis parameters
of a general $SU(2)$ Hamiltonian. Using a linear transformation between two different parameter
spaces of a unitary process, we provide a way to move from quantum Fisher information of a unitary
process in a given parametrization to the one of the other parametrization. Knowing this linear
transformation enables one to calculate the quantum Fisher information of a composite unitary
process, i.e. a unitary process resulted from successive action of some simple unitary processes.
We apply this method for a spin-half system and obtain the quantum Fisher matrix of the coset parameters
in terms of the one of the angle-axis parameters.
