The so-called preparation uncertainty can be understood in purely operational terms. Namely,
it occurs when for some pair of observables, there is no preparation, for which thier both exhibit
deterministic statistics. However, the right-hand side of uncertainty relation is generally
not operational as it depends on the quantum formalism. Also, while joint non-measurability of
observables is an operational notion, the complementarity in Bohr sense (i.e. excess of information
needed to describe the system) has not yet been expressed in purely operational terms. In this paper
we propose a solution to these problems, by introducing an operational definition for complementarity,
and further postulating uncertainty as a necessary price for complementarity in physical theories.
In other words, we propose to put the (operational) complementarity as the right hand side of uncertainty
relation. Concretly, we first identify two different notions of uncertainty and complementarity
for which the above principle holds in quantum mechanics. We also introduce postulates for the general
measures of uncertainty and complementarity. In order to define quantifiers of complementarity
we first turn to the simpler notion of independence that is defined solely in terms of statistics
two observables. We also use our framework to define new complementarity indicators based on (i)
performance of random access codes, (ii) geometrical properties of the body of observed statistics,
and (iii) variation of information. We then show that they can be used state uncertainty relations.
Moreover, we show that non-signaling and uncertainty relation expressed by complementarity of
type (ii) leads to the Tsirelson bound for CHSH inequality. Lastly, we show that a variant of Information
Causality called Information Content Principle, can be interpreted as uncertainty relation in
the above sense.
