Relaxation of few-body quantum systems can strongly depend on the initial state when the system's
semiclassical phase space is mixed, i.e., regions of chaotic motion coexist with regular islands.
In recent years, there has been much effort to understand the process of thermalization in strongly
interacting quantum systems that often lack an obvious semiclassical limit. Time-dependent variational
principle (TDVP) allows to systematically derive an effective classical (nonlinear) dynamical
system by projecting unitary many-body dynamics onto a manifold of weakly-entangled variational
states. We demonstrate that such dynamical systems generally possess mixed phase space. When TDVP
errors are small, the mixed phase space leaves a footprint on the exact dynamics of the quantum model.
For example, when the system is initialized in a state belonging to a stable periodic orbit or the
surrounding regular region, it exhibits persistent many-body quantum revivals. As a proof of principle,
we identify new types of "quantum many-body scars", i.e., initial states that lead to long-time
oscillations in a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in one and two dimensions. Intriguingly, the
initial states that give rise to most robust revivals are typically entangled states. On the other
hand, even when TDVP errors are large, as in the thermalizing tilted-field Ising model, initializing
the system in a regular region of phase space leads to slowdown of thermalization. Our work establishes
TDVP as a method for identifying interacting quantum systems with anomalous dynamics in arbitrary
dimensions. Moreover, the mixed-phase space classical variational equations allow to find slowly-thermalizing
initial conditions in interacting models. Our results shed light on a link between classical and
quantum chaos, pointing towards possible extensions of classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem
to quantum systems.
