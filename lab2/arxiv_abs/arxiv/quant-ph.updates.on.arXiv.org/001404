The aim of this work is to firstly demonstrate the efficacy of the recently proposed Orlicz space
formalism for Quantum theory \cite{ML}, and secondly to show how noncommutative differential
structures may naturally be incorporated into this framework. To start off with we specifically
propose regularity conditions which in the context of local algebras corresponding to Minkowski
space, ensure good behaviour of field operators as observables, and then show that fields obtained
by the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem are regular in this sense. The pair of Orlicz
spaces we explicitly use for this purpose, are respectively built on the exponential function and
on an entropic type function. This formalism has been shown to be well suited to a description of quantum
statistical mechanics, and in the present work we show that it is also a very useful and elegant tool
for Quantum Field Theory. We then introduce the class of tangentially conditioned algebras, which
is a large class of local algebras corresponding to globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds that
locally ``look like'' the local algebras of Minkowski space. On the one hand this ensures that at
a local level, the Orlicz space formalism discussed above is also relevant for a much more general
class of local algebras. On the other hand, the structure of this class of algebras, allows for the
development of a non-commutative differential geometric structure along the lines of the du Bois-Violette
approach to such a theory. In this way we obtain a complete depiction: integrable structures based
on local algebras provide a static setting for an analysis of Quantum Field Theory and an effective
tool for describing regular behaviour of field operators, whereas differentiable structures
posit indispensable tools for a description of equations of motion.
