Today, the nature of light is accounted for by one of the jewels of physics, quantum electrodynamics
(QED), the fundamental theory of light and matter. Yet owing to its infinite complexity, scientists
still debate how its central concept, the photon, can be reconciled with the perceived existence
of light waves, emerging 200 years ago in the wake of Young's double slit diffraction experiment.
Ever since, the phenomenon of diffraction has been viewed to embody the wave nature of light, leading
to the schizophrenic wave-particle duality. The latter does not exist in QED which is photon based
without the existence of waves. Here we introduce the new paradigm that diffraction images directly
reflect the fundamental quantum states of light. This is revealed by analysis of the evolution of
modern versions of Young's experiment performed with differently modified laser light and photon-based
detection. In conventional quantum mechanics, corresponding to first order QED, the fundamental
photon nature of light remains hidden since different quantum states produce only two basic types
of diffraction patterns that may also be explained by coherent and incoherent wave superposition.
The true photon based substructure of light is shown to clearly emerge through characteristic diffraction
images in second order QED. The degeneracy of the first order images is lifted, the wave-particle
equivalence breaks down, and the patterns directly reveal the true quantum substructure of light.
This allows the replacement of the conventional concept of wave coherence by a precise order-dependent
degree of coherence that quantifies the interference and diffraction behavior of all quantum states
of light.
