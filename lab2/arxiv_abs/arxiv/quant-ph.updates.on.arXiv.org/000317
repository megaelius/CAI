Optical multi-mode systems provide large scale Hilbert spaces that can be accessed and controlled
using single photon sources, linear optics and photon detection. Here, we consider the bipartite
entanglement generated by coherently distributing $M$ photons in $M$ modes to two separate locations,
where linear optics and photon detection is used to verify the non-classical correlations between
the two $M$-mode systems. We show that the entangled state is symmetric under mode shift operations
performed in the two systems and use this symmetry to derive correlations between photon number
distributions detected after a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the modes. The experimentally
observable correlations can be explained by a simple and intuitive rule that relates the sum of the
output mode indices to the eigenvalue of the input state under the mode shift operation. Since the
photon number operators after the DFT do not commute with the initial photon number operators, entanglement
is necessary to achieve strong correlations in both the initial mode photon numbers and the photon
numbers observed after the DFT. We can therefore derive entanglement witnesses based on the experimentally
observable correlations in both photon number distributions, providing a practical criterion
for the evaluation of large scale entanglement in optical multi-mode systems. Our method thus demonstrates
how non-classical signatures in large scale optical quantum circuits can be accessed experimentally
by choosing an appropriate combination of modes in which to detect the photon number distributions
that characterize the quantum coherences of the state.
