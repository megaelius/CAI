Of the many potential hardware platforms, superconducting quantum circuits have become the leading
contender for constructing a scalable quantum computing system. All current architecture designs
necessitate a 2D arrangement of superconducting qubits with nearest neighbour interactions,
compatible with powerful quantum error correction using the surface code. A major hurdle for scalability
in superconducting systems is the so called wiring problem, where qubits internal to a chip-set
become inaccessible for external control/readout lines. Current approaches resort to intricate
and exotic 3D wiring and packaging technology which is a significant engineering challenge to realize,
while maintaining qubit fidelity. Here we solve this problem and present a modified superconducting
scalable micro-architecture that does not require any 3D external line technology and reverts
back to a completely planar design. This is enabled by a new pseudo-2D resonator network that provides
inter-qubit connections via airbridges. We carried out experiments to examine the feasibility
of the newly introduced airbridge component. The measured quality factor of these new inter-qubit
resonators is sufficient for high fidelity gates, below the threshold for the surface code, with
negligible measured cross-talk. The resulting physical separation of the external wirings and
the inter-qubit connections on-chip should reduce cross-talk and decoherence as the chip-set
increases in size. This result demonstrates that a large-scale, fully error corrected quantum
computer can be constructed by monolithic integration technologies without additional overhead
and without special packaging know-hows.
