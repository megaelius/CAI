We expand the time reversal symmetry arguments of quantum mechanics, originally proposed by Wigner
in the context of unitary dynamics, to contain situations including generalized measurements
for monitored quantum systems. We propose a scheme to derive the time reversed measurement operators
by considering the Schr\"{o}dinger picture dynamics of a qubit coupled to a measuring device, and
show that the time reversed measurement operators form a Positive Operator Valued Measure (POVM)
set. We propose a general rule to reverse any rank two qubit measurement, and show that the time reversed
dynamics obeys the retrodicted equations of the forward dynamics starting from the time reversed
final state. We present three particular examples to illustrate time reversal of measurements:
(1) the Gaussian spin measurement, (2) a dichotomous POVM for spin, and (3) the measurement of qubit
fluorescence. We demonstrate the time reversal invariance of dynamical equations using the example
of qubit fluorescence. We also generalize the discussion of a statistical arrow of time for continuous
quantum measurements introduced by Dressel et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 220507 (2017)]: we show
that the backward probabilities can be computed from a process similar to retrodiction from the
time reversed final state, and extend the definition of an arrow of time to ensembles prepared with
pre- and post-selections, where we obtain a non-vanishing arrow of time in general. We discuss sufficient
conditions for when time's arrow vanishes and show our method also captures the contributions to
time's arrow due to natural physical processes like relaxation of an atom to its ground state. As
a special case, we recover the time reversibility of the weak value as its complex conjugate using
our method, and discuss how our conclusions differ from the time-symmetry argument of Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz
(ABL) rule.
