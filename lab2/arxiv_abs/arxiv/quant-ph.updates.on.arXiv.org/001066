It is known that the classical framework of causal models is not general enough to allow for causal
reasoning about quantum systems. Efforts have been devoted towards generalization of the classical
framework to the quantum case, with the aim of providing a framework in which cause-effect relations
between quantum systems, and their connection with empirically observed data, can be rigorously
analyzed. Building on the results of Allen et al., Phys. Rev. X 7, 031021 (2017), we present a fully-fledged
framework of quantum causal models. The approach situates causal relations in unitary transformations,
in analogy with an approach to classical causal models that assumes underlying determinism and
situates causal relations in functional dependences between variables. We show that for any quantum
causal model, there exists a corresponding unitary circuit, with appropriate causal structure,
such that the quantum causal model is returned when marginalising over latent systems, and vice
versa. We introduce an intrinsically quantum notion that plays a role analogous to the conditional
independence of classical variables, and (generalizing a central theorem of the classical framework)
show that d-separation is sound and complete in the quantum case. We present generalizations of
the three rules of the classical `do-calculus', in each case relating a property of the causal structure
to a formal property of the quantum process, and to an operational statement concerning the outcomes
of interventions. In addition to the results concerning quantum causal models, we introduce and
derive similar results for `classical split-node causal models', which are more closely analogous
to quantum causal models than the classical causal models that are usually studied.
