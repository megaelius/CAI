Manipulating quantum computing hardware in the presence of imperfect devices and control systems
is a central challenge in realizing useful quantum computers. Susceptibility to noise in particular
limits the performance and algorithmic capabilities experienced by end users. Fortunately, in
both the NISQ era and beyond, quantum control enables the efficient execution of quantum logic operations
and quantum algorithms exhibiting robustness to errors, without the need for complex logical encoding.
We introduce the first commercial-grade software tools for quantum control in quantum computing
research from Q-CTRL, serving the needs of hardware R\&D teams, algorithm developers, and end users.
We survey quantum control and its role in combating noise in near-term devices; our primary focus
is on quantum firmware, the low-level software solutions designed to enhance the stability of quantum
computational hardware at the physical layer. We explain the benefits of quantum firmware not only
in error suppression, but also in simplifying compilation protocols and enhancing the efficiency
of quantum error correction. We provide an overview of Q-CTRL's software tools for creating and
deploying quantum control solutions at various layers of the quantum computing software stack.
We describe our software architecture leveraging both distributed cloud computation and local
custom integration into hardware systems, and explain how key functionality is integrable with
other quantum programming languages. We present a detailed technical overview of product features
including a control-optimization engine, filter functions for general systems, and noise characterization.
Finally, we present a series of case studies demonstrating the utility of quantum control solutions
derived from these tools in improving the performance of trapped-ion and superconducting quantum
computer hardware.
