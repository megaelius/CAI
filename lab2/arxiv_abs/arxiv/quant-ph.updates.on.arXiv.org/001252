This work discloses some inconsistencies of quantum mechanics (QM) in two different contexts.
On the one hand the equivalence principle in his two formulations is the starting point of all gravitational
theories; yet there is no way to make it consistent with the non-relativistic formulation of QM.
Moreover, the evaluation of the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle in an accelerated reference
frame sheds light on a trajectory-dependent phase term subject to proper time. On the other hand,
the Bargmann theorem unmistakably proves that the Schr\"odinger equation does not admit any superposition
of different masses if the symmetry chosen for the system is the Galilean one. However, this is incompatible
with relativity, since mass and energy are equivalent and one can certainly superimpose different
energies. Both inconsistencies support the hypothesis that mass and proper time could be treated
as variables. In the third chapter we will describe a theory in which the Galilean symmetry is extended
by assuming particle mass and proper time as canonically conjugated classical variables, or conjugated
observables in the quantum theory. The first three chapters discuss subjects illustrated in several
articles of the professor Daniel M. Greenberger, which are listed in the bibliography. Whereas
in the last chapter the results of a recent theory on QW, say a discrete model for quantum particle
evolution, will be examined. In particular, the striking result is that, in the most natural physical
interpretation of QW dynamics, it is not possible to have a constant and invariant mass in any manner.
The long term aim of this work is indeed to study the reasons and consequences of a theory of particles
with variable mass in the context of wider studies still in progress on QW.
