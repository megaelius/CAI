In the past few decades, many works have been devoted to the study of exceptional points (EPs), i.e.,
exotic degeneracies of non-Hermitian systems. The usual approach in those studies involves the
introduction of a phenomenological effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), where the gain
and losses are incorporated as the imaginary frequencies of fields and from which the Hamiltonian
EPs (HEPs) are derived. Although this approach can provide valid equations of motion for the fields
in the classical limit, its application in the derivation of EPs in the quantum regime is questionable.
Recently, a framework [Minganti {\it et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.062131}{Phys.
Rev. A {\bf 100}, 062131 (2019)}], which allows one to determine quantum EPs from a Liouvillian EP
(LEP), rather than from an NHH, has been proposed. Compared to the NHHs, a Liouvillian naturally
includes quantum noise effects via quantum-jump terms, thus allowing one to consistently determine
its EPs purely in the quantum regime. In this work we study a non-Hermitian system consisting of coupled
cavities with unbalanced gain and losses, where the gain is far from saturation, i.e, the system
is assumed to be linear. We apply both formalisms, based on an NHH and a Liouvillian within the Scully-Lamb
laser theory, to determine and compare the corresponding HEPs and LEPs in the semiclassical and
quantum regimes. {Our results indicate that, although the overall spectral properties of the NHH
and the corresponding Liouvillian for a given system can differ substantially, their LEPs and HEPs
occur for the same combination of system parameters.}
