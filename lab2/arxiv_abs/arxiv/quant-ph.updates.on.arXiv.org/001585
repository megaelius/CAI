Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can provide information-theoretically secure communications
and is a strong candidate for the next generation of cryptography. However, in practice, the performance
of QKD is limited by "practical imperfections" in realistic sources, channels, and detectors (such
as multi-photon components or imperfect encoding from the sources, losses and misalignment in
the channels, or dark counts in detectors). Addressing such practical imperfections is a crucial
part of implementing QKD protocols with good performance in reality. There are two highly important
future directions for QKD: (1) QKD over free space, which can allow secure communications between
mobile platforms such as handheld systems, drones, planes, and even satellites, and (2) fibre-based
QKD networks, which can simultaneously provide QKD service to numerous users at arbitrary locations.
These directions are both highly promising, but so far they are limited by practical imperfections
in the channels and devices, which pose huge challenges and limit their performance. In this thesis,
we develop adaptive techniques with innovative protocol and algorithm design, as well as novel
techniques such as machine learning, to address some of these key challenges, including (a) atmospheric
turbulence in channels for free-space QKD, (b) asymmetric losses in channels for QKD network, and
(c) efficient parameter optimization in real time, which is important for both free-space QKD and
QKD networks. We believe that this work will pave the way to important implementations of free-space
QKD and fibre-based QKD networks in the future.
