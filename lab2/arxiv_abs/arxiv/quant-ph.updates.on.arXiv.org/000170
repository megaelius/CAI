Dirac's wave equation for a point electron in the electromagnetic Kerr--Newman spacetime is studied
in a zero-gravity limit; here, ``zero-gravity'' means $G\to 0$, where $G$ is Newton's constant
of universal gravitation. The zero-$G$ limit studied here eliminates the troublesome Cauchy horizon
of the Kerr--Newman spacetime and also its physically problematic acausal region of closed timelike
loops. While the gravitational features of the Kerr--Newman manifold vanish as well when $G\to
0$, the limit retains the nontrivial topology associated with its ring singularity of radius $|a|$,
and its electromagnetic Appell--Sommerfeld fields with charge $Q$ and ADM magnetic dipole moment
$Qa$. Moreover, one readily obtains $(Q,I)$-generalizations of this electromagnetic zero-$G$
Kerr--Newman (z$G$KN) spacetime with same charge $Q$ but with magnetic dipole moments $I\pi a^2$,
where $I$ is the equivalent electric current supported on a ring of radius $|a|$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$
which produces the same magnetic dipole moment in the far field multipole expansion. Dirac's equation
for a point electron in such spacetimes is commented on, too. The following results are obtained:
(1) The formal Dirac Hamiltonian on the static spacelike slices of the maximal analytically extended
z$G$KN spacetime is essentially self-adjoint. (2)The spectrum of any self-adjoint extension
is symmetric about zero for any charge and magnetic dipole moment. (3) The Dirac operator on the z$G$KN
spacetime has a continuous spectrum with a gap about zero that contains a point spectrum. The point
spectrum is associated with time-periodic normalizable solutions, representing bound states
of Dirac's point electron in the electromagnetic field of the ring singularity of the z$G$KN spacetime.
