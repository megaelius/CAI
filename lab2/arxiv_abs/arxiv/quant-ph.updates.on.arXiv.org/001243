The purpose of this paper is to study the interaction between a two-level system and two continuous-mode
photons. Two scenarios are investigated: Case 1, how a two-level system changes the pulse shapes
of two input photons propagating in a single input channel; and Case 2, how a two-level system responds
to two counter-propagating photons. By means of a transfer function approach, the steady-state
output field states for both cases are derived analytically. In Example 1, a two-photon input state
of Gaussian pulse shape is used to excite a two-level atom. The simulation demonstrates that in the
time domain the atom tends to stretch out the two photons. Moreover, the striking difference between
the joint probability distribution of the output two-photon state and that of the input two-photon
state occurs exactly under the setting when the two-level atom is most efficiently excited. In Example
2, a two-photon input state of rising exponential pulse shape is used to excite a two-level atom.
Strong anti-correlation of the output two-photon state is observed, which is absent in Example
1 for the Gaussian pulse shape. Such difference indicates that different pulse shapes give rise
to drastically different frequency entanglement of the output two-photon state. Example 3 is used
to illustrate Case 2, where two counter-propagating single photons of rising exponential pulse
shapes are input to a two-level atom. The frequency-dependent Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference
phenomenon is observed. The simulation results base on the analytic forms of output two-photon
states are consistent with those based on quantum master or filter equations [43,11]. Similar physical
phenomena have been observed in physical settings such as cavity opto-mechanical systems and Keer
nonlinear cavities.
