We take a resource-theoretic approach to the problem of quantifying nonclassicality in Bell scenarios.
We conceptualize the resources as probabilistic processes from the setting variables to the outcome
variables having a particular causal structure, namely, one wherein the wings are only connected
by a common cause. We term them ``common-cause boxes''. We define the distinction between classical
and nonclassical resources in terms of whether or not a classical causal model can explain the correlations.
We then quantify the relative nonclassicality of resources by considering their interconvertibility
relative to the set of operations that can be implemented using a classical common cause (which correspond
to local operations and shared randomness). We prove that the set of free operations forms a polytope,
which in turn allows us to derive an efficient algorithm for deciding whether one resource can be
converted to another. We moreover define two distinct monotones with simple closed-form expressions
in the two-party binary-setting binary-outcome scenario, and use these to reveal various properties
of the pre-order of resources, including a lower bound on the cardinality of any complete set of monotones.
In particular, we show that the information contained in the degrees of violation of facet-defining
Bell inequalities is not sufficient for quantifying nonclassicality, even though it is sufficient
for witnessing nonclassicality. Finally, we show that the continuous set of convexly extremal
quantumly realizable correlations are all at the top of the preorder of quantumly realizable correlations.
In addition to providing new insights on Bell nonclassicality, our work also sets the stage for quantifying
nonclassicality in more general causal networks.
