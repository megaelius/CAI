Extending the functionality and overcoming the performance limitation under which QKD can operate
requires either quantum repeaters or new security models. Investigating the latter option, we
introduce the \textit{Quantum Computational Hybrid} (QCH) security model, where we assume that
computationally secure encryption may only be broken after time much longer than the coherence
time of available quantum memories. We propose an explicit $d$-dimensional key distribution protocol,
that we call MUB-\textit{Quantum Computational Timelock} (MUB-QCT) where one bit is encoded on
a qudit state chosen among $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Short-term-secure encryption
is used to share the basis information with legitimate users while keeping it unknown from Eve until
after her quantum memory decoheres. This allows reducing Eve's optimal attack to an immediate measurement
followed by post-measurement decoding. \par We demonstrate that MUB-QCT enables everlasting
secure key distribution with input states containing up to $O(\sqrt{d})$ photons. This leads to
a series of important improvements when compared to QKD: on the functional side, the ability to operate
securely between one sender and many receivers, whose implementation can moreover be untrusted;
significant performance increase, characterized by a $O(\sqrt{d})$ multiplication of key rates
and an extension by $25 {\rm} km \times \log(d)$ of the attainable distance over fiber. Implementable
with a large number of modes with current or near-term multimode photonics technologies, the MUB-QCT
construction has the potential to provide a radical shift to the performance and practicality of
quantum key distribution.
