This chapter summarizes the recent progress in the theory and analytical tools of quadratic optomechanical
interactions, as one of the prominent domains of contemporary nonlinear quantum optics. Emphasis
has been put here first to show what types of nonlinear interactions do exist, and what physical interpretations
follow each. The standard quadratic interactions between light and mechanical motion is expressed
as the product of cavity light intensity and squared mirror position. However, there exists a non-standard
quadratic optomechanical interaction as well, which assumes a mathematically different form
and appears as the squared product of field and mirror momenta. This non-standard type of quadratic
interaction originates from two corrections: the momentum exchange and conservation among mirror
and field, as well as relativistic corrections due to different mechanisms. Both these types of
non-standard interactions become relevant when the ratio of mechanical to optical frequency is
no longer negligible. Next, we turn to the solution technique of such interactions, and introduce
a formal higher-order operator method to tackle the nonlinear evolution of quantum systems. This
enables one to accurately study any type of quantum nonlinear interaction using the analysis tools
of linear algebra. In order to employ the analytical power of higher-order operator method, one
first needs to identify a closed Lie algebra, which should satisfy closedness property under commutation
either exactly or approximately, and is referred to as the basis. Having the basis of higher-order
operators known, one may proceed to construct the corresponding Langevin equations, which can
be now conveniently analyzed using the existing mathematical toolbox of linear algebra to yield
the spectral densities, moments, and expectation values.
