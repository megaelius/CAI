Topological phases of matter can support fractionalized quasi-particles localized at topological
defects. The current understanding of these exotic excitations, based on the celebrated bulk-defect
correspondence, typically relies on crude approximations where such defects are replaced by a
static classical background coupled to the matter sector. In this work, we explore the strongly-correlated
nature of symmetry-protected topological defects by focusing on situations where such defects
arise spontaneously as dynamical solitons in intertwined topological phases, where symmetry
breaking coexists with topological symmetry protection. In particular, we focus on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
Bose-Hubbard model, a one-dimensional chain of interacting bosons coupled to $\mathbb{Z}_2$
fields, and show how solitons with $\mathbb{Z}_n$ topological charges appear for particle/hole
dopings about certain commensurate fillings, extending the results of [1] beyond half filling.
We show that these defects host fractionalized bosonic quasi-particles, forming bound states
that travel through the system unless externally pinned, and repel each other giving rise to a fractional
soliton lattice for sufficiently high densities. Moreover, we uncover the topological origin
of these fractional bound excitations through a pumping mechanism, where the quantization of the
inter-soliton transport allows us to establish a generalized bulk-defect correspondence. This
in-depth analysis of dynamical topological defects bound to fractionalized quasi-particles,
together with the possibility of implementing our model in cold-atomic experiments, paves the
way for further exploration of exotic topological phenomena in strongly-correlated systems.
