The aim of this essay is to analyze the role of quantum mechanics as an inherent characteristic of
life. During the last ten years the problem of the origin of life has become an innovative research
subject approached by many authors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the
problem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second presents the conceptual
and methodological basis of the essay which is founded on the Information Theory and the Quantum
Theory. This basis is then used, in the third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures
of a quantum origin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two of which
are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and biosystemic emergentism. From
a scientific perspective, all the theories and experimental evidences put forward by Biology can
be summed up in to two main research themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world,
from a physicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life while the vesicular
theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the essence of life can be found in cellular metabolism.
This essay uses the Information Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life through
replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is fundamental in order to
be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum computation to be able increase the probabilities
of existence of auto replicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence
of quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve the question of auto
replication, three scientific propositions are put forward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory
library and the role of algorithms in the origin of genetic language.
