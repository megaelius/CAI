Atoms subject to weak coherent incident light can be treated as coupled classical linear oscillators,
supporting subradiant and superradiant collective excitation eigenmodes. We identify the limits
of validity of this \emph{linear classical oscillator model} at increasing intensities of the
drive by solving the quantum many-body master equation for coherent and incoherent scattering
from a chain of trapped atoms. We show that deviations from the linear classical oscillator model
depend sensitively on the resonance linewidths $\upsilon_\alpha$ of the collective eigenmodes
excited by light, with the intensity at which substantial deviation occurs scaling as a powerlaw
of $\upsilon_\alpha$. The linear classical oscillator model then becomes inaccurate at much lower
intensities for subradiant collective excitations than superradiant ones, with an example system
of seven atoms resulting in critical incident light intensities differing by a factor of 30 between
the two cases. By individually exciting eigenmodes we find that this critical intensity has a $\upsilon_\alpha^{2.5}$
scaling for narrower resonances and more strongly interacting systems, while it approaches a $\upsilon_\alpha^3$
scaling for broader resonances and when the dipole-dipole interactions are reduced. The $\upsilon_\alpha^3$
scaling also corresponds to the semiclassical result whereby quantum fluctuations between the
atoms have been neglected. We study both the case of perfectly mode-matched drives and the case of
standing wave drives, with significant differences between the two cases appearing only at very
subradiant modes and positions of Fano resonances.
