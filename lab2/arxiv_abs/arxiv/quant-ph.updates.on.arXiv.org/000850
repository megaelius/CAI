The phase of an optical field inside a linear amplifier is widely known to diffuse with a diffusion
coefficient that is inversely proportional to the photon number. The same process occurs in lasers
which limits its intrinsic linewidth and makes the phase uncertainty difficult to calculate. The
most commonly used simplification is to assume a narrow photon-number distribution for the optical
field (which we call the small-noise approximation). This relies on (i) the input to have a good signal-to-noise
ratio, and (ii) that such a signal-to-noise ratio can be maintained throughout the amplification
process. Here we ask: How many photons must be present in the input to a quantum linear amplifier for
the phase noise to be amenable to a small-noise analysis? We show that for a linear amplifier which
is signal-to-noise optimised (i.e. an amplifier most favourable to the small-noise approximation),
the small-noise approximation breaks down for a coherent-state input with only a few photons on
average. Interestingly, when the input strength is increased to tens of photons, the small-noise
approximation can be seen to perform much better and the process of phase diffusion permits a small-noise
analysis. This demarcates the limit of the small-noise assumption in linear amplifiers as such
an assumption is less true for an amplifier which does not have its signal-to-noise performance
optimised. In order to explore this limit we propose a description of phase diffusion that goes beyond
the small-noise approximation which we call the inverse-number expansion. The small-noise approximation
can then be understood as the lowest-order contribution to the inverse-number expansion while
phase diffusion with only a few-photon input can be captured by the inclusion of higher-order terms.
