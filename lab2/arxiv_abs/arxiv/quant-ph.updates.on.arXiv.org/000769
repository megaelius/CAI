Small, out-of-equilibrium, and quantum systems defy simple thermodynamic expressions. Such
systems are exemplified by molecular switches, which exchange heat with a bath and which can photoisomerize,
or change conformation upon absorbing light. The likelihood of photoisomerization depends on
kinetic details that couple the molecule's internal energetics with its interaction with the bath,
hindering predictions. We derive simple, general bounds on the photoisomerization yield, using
a resource-theory model for thermodynamics. The resource-theory framework is a set of mathematical
tools, developed in quantum information theory, for modeling any setting in which constraints
restrict the operations performable and the systems accessible. Resource theories are being used
to generalize thermodynamics to small and quantum settings. Specifically, we use the thermomajorization
preorder, a resource-theory generalization of the second law. Thermomajorization follows from
the minimal assumptions of energy conservation and a fixed bath temperature. Using thermomajorization,
we upper-bound the photoisomerization yield. Then, we compare the bound with expectations from
detailed balance and from simple Lindbladian evolution. Our minimal assumptions constrain the
yield tightly if a laser barely excites the molecule, such that thermal fluctuations drive conformation
changes, and weakly if the laser excites the molecule to one high-energy eigenstate. We also quantify
and bound the coherence in the molecule's post-photoisomerization electronic state. Electronic
coherence cannot boost the yield in the absence of extra resources, we argue, because modes of coherence
transform independently via resource-theory operations. This work illustrates how thermodynamic
resource theories can offer insights into complex quantum processes in nature, experiments, and
synthetics.
