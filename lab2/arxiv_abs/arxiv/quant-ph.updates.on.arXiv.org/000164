We present a comprehensive study of maximally entangled symmetric states of arbitrary numbers
of qubits in the sense of the maximal mixedness of the one-qubit reduced density operator. A general
criterion is provided to easily identify whether given symmetric states are maximally entangled
in that respect or not. We show that these maximally entangled symmetric (MES) states are the only
symmetric states for which the expectation value of the associated collective spin of the system
vanishes, as well as in corollary the dipole moment of the Husimi function. We establish the link
between this kind of maximal entanglement, the anticoherence properties of spin states, and the
degree of polarization of light fields. We analyze the relationship between the MES states and the
classes of states equivalent through stochastic local operations with classical communication
(SLOCC). We provide a nonexistence criterion of MES states within SLOCC classes of qubit states
and show in particular that the symmetric Dicke state SLOCC classes never contain such MES states,
with the only exception of the balanced Dicke state class for even numbers of qubits. The 4-qubit
system is analyzed exhaustively and all MES states of this system are identified and characterized.
Finally the entanglement content of MES states is analyzed with respect to the geometric and barycentric
measures of entanglement, as well as to the generalized N-tangle. We show that the geometric entanglement
of MES states is ensured to be larger than or equal to 1/2, but also that MES states are not in general
the symmetric states that maximize the investigated entanglement measures.
