We study the effectiveness of quantum error correction against coherent noise. Coherent errors
(for example, unitary noise) can interfere constructively, so that in some cases the average infidelity
of a quantum circuit subjected to coherent errors may increase quadratically with the circuit size;
in contrast, when errors are incoherent (for example, depolarizing noise), the average infidelity
increases at worst linearly with circuit size. We consider the performance of quantum stabilizer
codes against a noise model in which a unitary rotation is applied to each qubit, where the axes and
angles of rotation are nearly the same for all qubits. In particular, we show that for the toric code
subject to such independent coherent noise, and for minimal-weight decoding, the logical channel
after error correction becomes increasingly incoherent as the length of the code increases, provided
the noise strength decays inversely with the code distance. A similar conclusion holds for weakly
correlated coherent noise. Our methods can also be used for analyzing the performance of other codes
and fault-tolerant protocols against coherent noise. However, our result does not show that the
coherence of the logical channel is suppressed in the more physically relevant case where the noise
strength is held constant as the code block grows, and we recount the difficulties that prevented
us from extending the result to that case. Nevertheless our work supports the idea that fault-tolerant
quantum computing schemes will work effectively against coherent noise, providing encouraging
news for quantum hardware builders who worry about the damaging effects of control errors and coherent
interactions with the environment.
