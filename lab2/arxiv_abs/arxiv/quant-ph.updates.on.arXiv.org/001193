Schr{\"o}dinger-Pauli (SP) theory is a description of electrons in the presence of a static electromagnetic
field in which the interaction of the magnetic field with both the orbital and spin moments is explicitly
considered. The theory is described from a new perspective, viz. that of the individual electron
via its equation of motion or `Quantal Newtonian' first law. The law leads to new physical and mathematical
insights into the theory. The law is in terms of `classical' fields whose sources are quantum mechanical
expectation values of Hermitian operators taken with respect to the system wave function. The law
states that each electron experiences an external and an internal field, the sum of which vanish.
The external field is the sum of the electrostatic and a Lorentz field. The internal field is a sum
of fields: the electron-interaction, differential density, kinetic, and internal magnetic fields.
These fields are respectively representative of a property of the system: electron correlations
due to the Pauli exclusion principle and Coulomb repulsion, the electron density, kinetic effects,
and the physical current density. The energy components can be expressed in integral virial form
in terms of these fields. The law leads to the further understanding that the Hamiltonian is an exactly
known and universal functional of the wave function. This allows for the generalization of the SP
equation, which then proves it to be intrinsically self-consistent. A Quantal density functional
(local effective potential) theory of the SP system is developed. Further generalizations of the
present work to the temporal case, and relativistic Dirac theory are proposed.
