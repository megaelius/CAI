We study quantum correlations and discord in a bipartite continuous variable hybrid system formed
by linear combinations of coherent states $|\alpha\rangle$ and single photon added coherent states
(SPACS) of the form $|\psi\rangle_{\text{dp(pa)}}= \mathcal{N}/\sqrt{2} (\hat{a}^\dagger
|\alpha\rangle_a |\alpha\rangle_b \pm \hat{b}^\dagger |\alpha\rangle_a |\alpha\rangle_b)$.
We stablish a relationship between the quantum discord with a local observable (the quadrature
variance for one sub-system) under the influence of scattering and phase fluctuation noise. For
the pure states the quantum correlations are characterized by means of measurement induced disturbance
(MID) with simultaneous quadrature measurements. In a scenario where homodyne conditional measurements
are available we show that the MID provides an easy way to select optimal phases to obtain information
of the maximal correlations in the channels. The quantum correlations of these entangled states
with channel losses are quantitatively characterized with the quantum discord (QD) with a displaced
qubit projector. We observe that as scattering increases, QD decreases monotonically. At the same
time for the state $|\psi\rangle_{\text{dp}}$, QD is more resistant to high phase fluctuations
when the average photon number $n_0$ is bigger than zero, but if phase fluctuations are low, QD is
more resistant if $n_0=0$. For the dp model with scattering, we obtain an analytical expression
of the QD as a function of the observable quadrature variance in a local sub-system. This relation
allows us to have a way to obtain the degree of QD in the channel by just measuring a local property observable
such as the quadrature variance. For the other model this relation still exists but is explored numerically.
This relation is an important result that allows to identify quantum processing capabilities in
terms of just local observables.
