The standard interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) implies that QM is a contextual theory and
that the probability measures associated with quantum states do not satisfy the assumptions of
Kolmogorov's probability theory. These features of QM are shared nowadays by other scientific
theories, as some quantum-like models of cognitive phenomena. We aim to show that contextuality
may lead to explain non-Kolmogorovian probabilities in Kolmogorovian terms by referring to a class
of theories in which entities, states, properties and contexts play a basic role. To this end we introduce
a propositional language L whose propositions embody a reference to microscopic contexts, a classical
probability measure on the set of all propositions of L and a family of classical probability measures
on sets of microscopic contexts, each element of the family corresponding to a.macroscopic measurement
context associated with a measurement procedure. This classical framework characterizes a subclass
of theories in which mean conditional probabilities on a subset of propositions of L and q-probabilities
on the set of all properties can be defined which admit an epistemic interpretation but generally
do not satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms. If one maintains that QM belongs to this subclass, then quantum
probabilities can be interpreted as examples of q-probabilities, which shows that they can be obtained
as derived notions in a Kolmogorovian framework whenever contextuality is taken into account,
explains how they can be non-classical and provides them with an epistemic interpretation. As a
by-product, the distinction between compatible and incompatible properties is explained in a
natural way, and purely theoretical classical conditional probabilities are shown to coexist
with empirically testable quantum conditional probabilities.
