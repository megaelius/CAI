A continuous family of quasilocal exact conservation laws is constructed in the anisotropic Heisenberg
(XXZ) spin-1/2 chain for periodic (or twisted) boundary conditions and for a set of commensurate
anisotropies densely covering the entire easy plane interaction regime. With respect to a full
set of strictly local conserved operators obtained from the standard (Hermitian) transfer operator
in fundamental representation (with auxiliary spin s=1/2), which are all even with respect to a
spin flip operation, the quasilocal family is generated by differentiation of a non-Hermitian
highest weight transfer operator with respect to a complex auxiliary spin representation parameter
s and includes also operators of odd parity. For a finite chain with open boundaries the time derivatives
of quasilocal operators are not strictly vanishing but result in operators localized near the boundaries
of the chain. We show that a simple modification of the non-Hermitian transfer operator results
in exactly conserved, but still quasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary
conditions. As an application, we demonstrate that implementing the new exactly conserved operator
family for estimating the high-temperature spin Drude weight results, in the thermodynamic limit,
in exactly the same lower bound as for almost conserved family for open boundaries. Furthermore,
under the assumption that the bound is saturating (which may be suggested by agreement with previous
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations) we propose a simple construction of infinite time averages
of local operators with odd spin-flip parity, such as the spin current.
