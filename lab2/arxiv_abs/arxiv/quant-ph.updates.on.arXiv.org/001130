We introduce a novel private-key quantum money scheme with the verification procedure based on
Sampling Matching, a problem in one-way communication complexity model introduced by Kumar et
al. [arXiv:1811.09154]. Our scheme involves an honest note producing entity, Bank, who prepares
every note by independently and uniformly selecting multiple n-bit binary secret strings and encoding
them into the single photon states. The notes are then distributed among untrusted holders. To carry
out a transaction, the holder sends the note to the honest local verifiers of the Bank. The verifier
runs the Sampling Matching procedure on the holder's note and obtains the classical measurement
outcomes. This is forwarded to the Bank who declares the validity of the note based on the outcomes
received. The key aspects of our money scheme include: single round classical interaction between
the local verifier and the Bank; verification circuit that uses only n passive 50/50 beam splitters
and which is fixed for all the notes prepared using n-bit sized binary strings; the re-usability
of each note in our scheme which grows linearly with the size of note; and an unconditional security
against any adversary trying to forge the bank note while tolerating the noise of upto 21.4$\%$.
The simplistic nature of our verification scheme allows for the ability to reach a maximal theoretical
noise tolerance of 25$\%$, as conjectured by Amiri et al. [Phys. Rev. A 95, 062334]. Finally, we describe
the practical implementation technique of our scheme using weak coherent states which requires
only a single beam splitter and 2 threshold detectors irrespective of the string size. This considerable
reduction in the number of optical components enables our scheme to go to arbitrarily large input
sizes, thus showcasing the ability to reach higher robustness experimentally compared to all the
existing money schemes.
