The characteristics of BQC is that it enables a client with less quantum abilities to delegate her
quantum computation to a server with strong quantum computablities while keeping the client's
privacy. In this article, we study single client-server BQC based on measurement which is verifiable.
In detail, the verifiability is that the client Alice can obtain the correct measurement results
if the server Bob is honest, while Bob does not get nothing of Alice's secret information if he is malicious.
We construct a latticed state, composed of six-qubit cluster states and eight-qubit entangled
states, to realize Alice's quantum computing. In this proposed protocol, the cilent Alice prepares
and sends initial single-qubit states to Bob, where the initial states include useful qubits and
trap qubits. And then Bob performs controlled-Z gate to produce the entanglement and returns them
to Alice. Alice will send trap qubits and useful qubits to Bob randomly and Bob returns all measurement
results to her. Alice makes a comparison for trap qubits between true results and Bob's results to
check the honesty of Bob. In a word, the trap qubtis have two purposes: 1) confusing Bob to keep the
blindness; 2)verifying the honesty of Bob and correctness of Bob's quantum computing. There has
an important feature that Alice does not need to encrypt the computing angles by $r\pi$ (r$\in\{0,1\}$),
meanwhile the blindness and correctness can also be ensured. That is, Alice's computing results
don't need to flipped since Bob is not impossible know anything about the quantum computation. Our
work gives a better understanding for verifiable BQC based on measurement.
