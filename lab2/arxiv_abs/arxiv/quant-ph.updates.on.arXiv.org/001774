We present results of a numerical experiment in which a neutral spin-1/2 particle subjected to a
static magnetic vortex field passes through a double-slit barrier. We demonstrate that the resulting
interference pattern on a detection screen exhibits fringes reminiscent of Aharonov-Bohm scattering
by a magnetic flux tube. To gain better understanding of the observed behavior, we provide analytic
solutions for a neutral spin-1/2 rigid planar rotor in the aforementioned magnetic field. We demonstrate
how that system exhibits a non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect due to the emergence of an effective
Wu-Yang (WY)flux tube. We study the behavior of the gauge invariant partition function and demonstrate
a topological phase transition for the spin-1/2 planar rotor. We provide an expression for the partition
function in which its dependence on the Wilson loop integral of the WY gauge potential is explicit.
We generalize to a spin-1 system in order to explore the Wilzcek-Zee (WZ) mechanism in a full quantum
setting. We show how degeneracy can be lifted by higher order gauge corrections that alter the semi-classical,
non-Abelian, WZ phase. Models that allow analytic description offer a foil to objections that question
the fidelity of predictions based on the generalized Born-Oppenheimer approximation in atomic
and molecular systems. Though the primary focus of this study concerns the emergence of gauge structure
in neutral systems, the theory is also applicable to systems that posses electric charge. In that
case, we explore interference between fundamental gauge fields (i.e. electromagnetism) with
effective gauge potentials. We propose a possible laboratory demonstration for the latter in an
ion trap setting. We illustrate how effective gauge potentials influence wave-packet revivals
in the said ion trap.
