Setting a system in ordered motion using thermal energy requires more than a temperature gradient.
Breaking of a certain spatial symmetry is indispensable in order to trigger the motion. We study
a minimalistic autonomous thermal rotor consisting of two interacting particles, each moving
on a ring consisting of three sites. Each particle is weakly coupled to a thermal bath, and the rotation
is enabled whenever a generalized particle exchange symmetry is broken. When both tunnelling between
sites and inter-particle interaction are non-negligible, the dynamics of the rotor is described
by a "global" master equation, which acts on the system as a whole, making it difficult to define local
particle current. By extending the standard approach used in quantum transport theory, we overcome
this difficulty and introduce a new universal particle current operator, the average of which admits
an elegant interpretation in terms of quantum weak measurements. We are thus able to describe the
operation of the rotor deep in the quantum regime, which not only allows us to rigorously connect
the occurrence of transport and symmetry breaking in the model, but also uncover two purely quantum
features of the machine. First, current can change its direction as the tunnelling rate is varied.
Second, powered by global rotation symmetry, our machine is capable of evolving initially uncorrelated
states into entangled steady states at any temperatures of the baths, provided the initial local
states are coherent enough. Lastly, at sufficiently high tunnelling rates, our machine can convert
initially passive (e.g., thermal) states of the rotor into non-equilibrium steady states from
which non-zero work can be extracted.
