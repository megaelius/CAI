We propose a new methodology, called numerical canonical quantization, to solve quantum Maxwell's
equations useful for mathematical modeling of quantum optics physics, and numerical experiments
on arbitrary passive and lossless quantum-optical systems. It is based on: (1) the macroscopic
(phenomenological) electromagnetic theory on quantum electrodynamics (QED), and (2) concepts
borrowed from computational electromagnetics. It was shown that canonical quantization in inhomogeneous
dielectric media required definite and proper normal modes. Here, instead of ad-hoc analytic normal
modes, we numerically construct complete and time-reversible normal modes in the form of traveling
waves to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we directly solve the Helmholtz wave equations
for a general linear, reciprocal, isotropic, non-dispersive, and inhomogeneous dielectric media
by using either finite-element or finite-difference methods. To convert a scattering problem
with infinite number of modes into one with a finite number of modes, we impose Bloch-periodic boundary
conditions. This will sparsely sample the normal modes with numerical Bloch-Floquet-like normal
modes. Subsequent procedure of numerical canonical quantization is straightforward using linear
algebra. We provide relevant numerical recipes in detail and show an important numerical example
of indistinguishable two-photon interference in quantum beam splitters, exhibiting Hong-Ou-Mandel
effect, which is purely a quantum effect. Also, the present methodology provides a way of numerically
investigating existing or new macroscopic QED theories. It will eventually allow quantum-optical
numerical experiments of high fidelity to replace many real experiments as in classical electromagnetics.
