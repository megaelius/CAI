Some properties of physical systems can be characterized from their correlations. In that framework,
subsystems are viewed as abstract devices that receive measurement settings as inputs and produce
measurement outcomes as outputs. The labeling convention used to describe these inputs and outputs
does not affect the physics; and relabelings are easily implemented by rewiring the input and output
ports of the devices. However, a more general class of operations can be achieved by using correlated
preprocessing and postprocessing of the inputs and outputs. In contrast to relabelings, some of
these operations irreversibly lose information about the underlying device. Other operations
are reversible, but modify the number of cardinality of inputs and/or outputs. In this work, we single
out the set of deterministic local maps as the one satisfying two equivalent constructions: an operational
definition from causality, and an axiomatic definition reminiscent of the definition of quantum
completely positive trace-preserving maps. We then study the algebraic properties of that set.
Surprisingly, the study of these fundamental properties has deep and practical applications.
First, the invariant subspaces of these transformations directly decompose the space of correlations/Bell
inequalities into nonsignaling, signaling and normalization components. This impacts the classification
of Bell and causal inequalities, and the construction of assemblages/witnesses in steering scenarios.
Second, the left and right invertible deterministic local operations provide an operational generalization
of the liftings introduced by Pironio [J. Math. Phys., 46(6):062112 (2005)]. Not only Bell-local,
but also causal inequalities can be lifted; liftings also apply to correlation boxes in a variety
of scenarios.
