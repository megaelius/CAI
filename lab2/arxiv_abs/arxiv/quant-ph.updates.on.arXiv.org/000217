Quantum illumination (QI) is an entanglement-enhanced sensing system whose performance advantage
over a comparable classical system survives its usage in an entanglement-breaking scenario plagued
by loss and noise. In particular, QI's error-probability exponent for discriminating between
equally-likely hypotheses of target absence or presence is 6 dB higher than that of the optimum classical
system using the same transmitted power. This performance advantage, however, presumes that the
target return, when present, has known amplitude and phase, a situation that seldom occurs in lidar
applications. At lidar wavelengths, most target surfaces are sufficiently rough that their returns
are speckled, i.e., they have Rayleigh-distributed amplitudes and uniformly-distributed phases.
QI's optical parametric amplifier receiver -- which affords a 3 dB better-than-classical error-probability
exponent for a return with known amplitude and phase -- fails to offer any performance gain for Rayleigh-fading
targets. We show that the sum-frequency generation receiver [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 040801 (2017)]
-- whose error-probability exponent for a nonfading target achieves QI's full 6 dB advantage over
optimum classical operation -- outperforms the classical system for Rayleigh-fading targets.
In this case, QI's advantage is subexponential: its error probability is lower than the classical
system's by a factor of $1/\ln(M\bar{\kappa}N_S/N_B)$, when $M\bar{\kappa}N_S/N_B \gg 1$, with
$M\gg 1$ being the QI transmitter's time-bandwidth product, $N_S \ll 1$ its brightness, $\bar{\kappa}$
the target's average reflectivity, and $N_B$ the background light's brightness.
