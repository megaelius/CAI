Quantum sensing techniques have been successful in pushing the sensitivity limits in numerous
fields, and hold great promise for scanning probes that study nano-scale devices and novel materials.
However, forming a nano-scale qubit that is simple and robust enough to be placed on a scanning tip,
and sensitive enough to detect various physical observables, is still a great challenge. Here we
demonstrate a conceptually new qubit implementation in a carbon nanotube that achieves these requirements.
In contrast to the prevailing semiconducting qubits that use electronic states in double quantum
dots, our qubit utilizes the natural electronic wavefunctions in a single quantum dot. Using an
ultraclean nanotube we construct a qubit from two wavefunctions with significantly different
magnetic moments and spatial charge distributions, making it sensitive to both magnetic and electric
fields. We use an array of gates to directly image these wavefunctions and demonstrate their localized
moments. Owing to their different spatial structure, these wavefunctions also show radically
different transport properties, giving us a simple transport-based qubit readout mechanism.
Due to its narrow coherence-limited transition, the qubit demonstrates significantly better
electric field detection sensitivity than a single electron transistor. Moreover, with the same
qubit we demonstrate simultaneous probing of magnetic fields with DC sensitivity comparable to
that of NV centers. Our technique has minimal requirements for device complexity, which can be implemented
using a number of straightforward fabrication methods. These features make this atomic-like qubit
a powerful new tool that enables a variety of new nanoscale imaging experiments.
