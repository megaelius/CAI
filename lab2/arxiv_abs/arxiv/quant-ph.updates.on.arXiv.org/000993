We begin this thesis by expanding the technique of teleportation simulation, which adds noise to
the entangled resource state to mimic channel effects. By introducing classical noise in the communication
step, we show it is possible to simulate more than just Pauli channels using teleportation. This
new class is characterised, and studied in detail for a particular resource state, leading to a family
of simulable channels named "Pauli-Damping channels" whose properties are analysed. Also introduced
are a new family of quantum states, "phase Werner" states, whose entanglement properties relate
to the interesting conjecture of bound entangled states with a negative partial transpose. Holevo-Werner
channels, to which these states are connected, are shown to be teleportation covariant. We exploit
this to present several interesting results, including the optimal estimation of the channel-defining
parameter. The minimal binary-discrimination error for Holevo-Werner channels is bounded for
the first time with the analytical form of the quantum Chernoff bound. We also consider the secret
key capacity of these channels, showing how different entanglement measures provide a better upper
bound for different regions of these channels. Finally, a method for generating new Bell inequalities
is presented, exploiting nonphysical probability distributions to obtain new inequalities.
Tens of thousands of new inequivalent inequalities are generated, and their usefulness in closing
the detection loophole for imperfect detectors is examined, with comparison to the current optimal
construction. Two candidate Bell inequalities which may equal or beat the best construction are
presented.
