A primary goal in recent research on contextuality has been to extend this concept to cases of inconsistent
connectedness, where observables have different distributions in different contexts. This article
proposes a solution within the framework of probabilistic causal models, which extend hidden-variables
theories, and then demonstrates an equivalence to the contextuality-by-default (CbD) framework.
CbD distinguishes contextuality from direct influences of context on observables, defining the
latter purely in terms of probability distributions. Here we take a causal view of direct influences,
defining direct influence within any causal model as the probability of all latent states of the
system in which a change of context changes the outcome of a measurement. Model-based contextuality
(M-contextuality) is then defined as the necessity of stronger direct influences to model a full
system than when considered individually. For consistently connected systems, M-contextuality
agrees with standard contextuality. For general systems, it is proved that M-contextuality is
equivalent to the property that any model of a system must contain "hidden influences", meaning
direct influences that go in opposite directions for different latent states, or equivalently
signaling between observers that carries no information. This criterion can be taken as formalizing
the "no-conspiracy" principle that has been proposed in connection with CbD. M-contextuality
is then proved to be equivalent to CbD-contextuality, thus providing a new interpretation of CbD-contextuality
as the non-existence of a model for a system without hidden direct influences.
