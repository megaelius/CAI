In this work, we exhaustively investigate $1 \rightarrow 2$ local and non local broadcasting of
entanglement and correlations (optimal and non-optimal) using asymmetric Pauli cloners, with
the most general two qubit state as a resource. We exemplify the broadcasting of entanglement using
Maximally Entangled Mixed States and demostrate the variation of broadcasting range with the amount
of entanglement in resource state as well as the asymmetry in the cloner. We show that it is impossible
to optimally broadcast quantum correlations that go beyond entanglement (Geometric Discord)
with the help of these asymmetric Pauli cloning machines. We introduce the concept of asymmetry
in correlations to quantify the degree of variation in the amount of correlation present in the output
pairs obtained after broadcasting. We also study the problem of $1 \rightarrow 3$ broadcasting
of entanglement using non-maximally entangled state (NME) as a resource. We adopt two different
strategies : successive application of $1 \rightarrow 2$ optimal cloning machines and application
of $1 \rightarrow 3$ optimal cloning machines. Interestingly, we show that $1 \rightarrow 3$ optimal
cloner does a better job at broadcasting than the successive application of $1 \rightarrow 2$ cloners.
Finally, we create an example to show that there are local unitaries, which when applied on non-maximally
entangled state locally give us a better range of broadcasting, that surpasses the best possible
range obtained using cloning machines. This result opens up a new direction in exploration of methods
to perform broadcasting which may outperform standard broadcasting strategies implemented through
cloning transformations.
