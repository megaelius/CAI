Gauge theories establish the standard model of particle physics, and lattice gauge theory (LGT)
calculations employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been pivotal in our understanding
of fundamental interactions. The present limitations of MCMC techniques may be overcome by Hamiltonian-based
simulations on classical or quantum devices, which further provide the potential to address questions
that lay beyond the capabilities of the current approaches. However, for continuous gauge groups,
Hamiltonian-based formulations involve infinite-dimensional gauge degrees of freedom that
can solely be handled by truncation. Current truncation schemes require dramatically increasing
computational resources at small values of the bare couplings, where magnetic field effects become
important. Such limitation precludes one from `taking the continuous limit' while working with
finite resources. To overcome this limitation, we provide a resource-efficient protocol to simulate
LGTs with continuous gauge groups in the Hamiltonian formulation. Our new method allows for calculations
at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing. The approach consists of the combination
of a Hilbert space truncation with a regularization of the gauge group, which permits an efficient
description of the magnetically-dominated regime. We use $2+1$ dimensional quantum electrodynamics
as a benchmark example to demonstrate this efficient framework to achieve the continuum limit in
LGTs. This possibility is a key requirement to make quantitative predictions at the field theory
level and offers the long-term perspective to utilise quantum simulations to compute physically
meaningful quantities in regimes that are precluded to quantum Monte Carlo.
