Recently \cite{paper, paper2, paper3}, it was shown that dissipative quantum systems with three
or more levels are able to synchronize to an external signal, but it was stated that it is not possible
for two-level systems as they lack a stable limit cycle in the unperturbed dynamics. At the same time,
this statement contradicts \cite{TPaper1, TPaper2, ExtraPaper3, ExtraPaper4}, since synchronization
in qubits is numerically demonstrated. However, nothing is said about the appearance of a limit
cycle. We show how a quantum two-level system can be understood as containing a valid limit cycle
as the starting point of synchronization, and that it can synchronize its dynamics to an external
weak signal. This is demonstrated by analytically solving the Lindblad equation of a two-level
system immersed in a thermal bath, determining the steady state. This is a mixed state with contributions
from many pure states, each of which provides a valid limit cycle. We show that this is sufficient
to phase-lock the dynamics to a weak external signal, hence clarifying synchronization in two-level
systems. We use the Husimi Q representation to analyze the synchronization region, defining a synchronization
measure which characterizes the strength of the phase-locking. Also, we study the stability of
the limit cycle and its deformation with the strength of the signal in terms of the components of the
Bloch vector of the system. Finally, we generalize the model of the three-level system from \cite{paper}
in order to illustrate how the stationary fixed point of that model can be changed into a limit cycle
similar to the one that we describe for the two-level system.
