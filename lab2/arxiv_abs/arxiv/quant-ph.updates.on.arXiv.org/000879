One of the main challenges of quantum many-body physics is that the dimensionality of the Hilbert
space grows exponentially with the system size, which makes it extremely difficult to solve the
Schr\"{o}dinger equations of the system. But typically, many physical systems have a simplified
internal structure which makes the parameters needed to characterize their ground states exponentially
smaller. This makes many numerical methods possible in capture the physics of the system. Among
these modern numerical techniques, neural networks, which show great power in approximating functions
and extracting features of the big data, are now attracting many interests. Neural network representation
of quantum many-body states shows great potential in solving some traditionally difficult quantum
problems involving large number of freedoms. In this work, we briefly review the progress of using
the artificial neural network to build quantum many-body ansatz states. We take Boltzmann machine
representation as a prototypical example to illustrate various aspects of neural network representation
of quantum many-body states. We first briefly review the classical neural networks, then we illustrate
how to use neural networks to represent quantum states and density operators. Some physical properties
of the neural network states, including entanglement features, representational power, and the
relation with tensor network states, are discussed. For applications, we briefly review the progress
of many-body calculating based on neural network states, neural network state approach to tomography,
and also the classical simulation of quantum computing based on Boltzmann machine states. At the
end of the work, some outlooks and open problems are given.
