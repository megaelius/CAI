It was recently proposed to leverage the representational power of artificial neural networks,
in particular Restricted Boltzmann Machines, in order to model complex quantum states of many-body
systems [Science, 355(6325), 2017]. States represented in this way, called Neural Network States
(NNSs), were shown to display interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture long-range
quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network representation of a given
state might be challenging, and so far this problem has been addressed with stochastic optimization
techniques. In this work we explore a different direction. We study how the action of elementary
quantum operations modifies NNSs. We parametrize a family of many body quantum operations that
can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted Boltzmann Machines, by just adding
hidden nodes and updating the network parameters. We show that this parametrization contains a
set of universal quantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum circuit
can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden nodes that grows linearly with the
number of elementary operations in the circuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which
was recently obtained with different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no
general and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted description of quantum
states. To circumvent this problem, we propose a step-wise procedure based on the projection of
Unrestricted quantum states to Restricted quantum states. In turn, two approximate methods to
perform this projection are discussed. In this way, we show that it is in principle possible to approximately
optimize or evolve Neural Network States without relying on stochastic methods such as Variational
Monte Carlo, which are computationally expensive.
