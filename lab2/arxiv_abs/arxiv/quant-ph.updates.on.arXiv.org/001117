We present a series of experiments performed with two ultracold one-dimensional Bose gases (rubidium
atoms) in a double well potential. Employing matter-wave interference, we can measure the spatially
resolved phase difference between the two gases and consequently investigate spatial correlations.
By investigating whether higher order correlation functions can be factorized into correlations
of lower order, we can investigate the interaction properties of the system. For a non-interacting
system, all correlation functions with orders greater than two factorize and one observes Gaussian
fluctuations. Here, we present the measurement of non-factorizing fourth-order correlation
functions, leading to an experimental characterization of the interactions between the collective
excitations of the quantum many-body system. The degree of non-factorizibility, i.e., the degree
of non-Gaussianity of the phase fluctuations, depends on the tuneable tunneling strength between
the wells. Starting from such a non-Gaussian state, we are able to observe the dynamical evolution
towards a state with factorizing correlation functions (Gaussian fluctuations). We start in a
double well with tunneling and then abruptly decouple the two subsystems. Subsequently, we observe
how the initially non-Gaussian phase fluctuations become Gaussian. Moreover, we discuss the dynamical
emergence of phase coherence in a double well potential with tunneling. We experimentally investigate
the evolution starting from two different initial states. In one case, we split a cloud of atoms into
two and trigger global oscillations in their relative phase. The oscillations subsequently damp
and phase coherence sets in. In the other case, two independent clouds are suddenly coupled by tunneling.
Again, phase coherence emerges between the two subsystems.
