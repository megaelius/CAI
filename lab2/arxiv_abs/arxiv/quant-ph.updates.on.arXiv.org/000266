By generalizing the Cabello-Severini-Winter (CSW) framework, we build a bridge from this graph-theoretic
approach for Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality to a hypergraph-theoretic approach for Spekkens'
contextuality, as applied to Kochen-Specker type scenarios. Our generalized framework describes
an experiment that requires, besides the correlations between measurements carried out on a system
prepared according to a fixed preparation procedure (as in Bell-KS type experiments), the correlations
between measurement outcomes and corresponding preparations that seek to make these measurement
outcomes highly predictable. This latter feature of the experiment allows us to obtain noise-robust
noncontextuality inequalities by applying the assumption of noncontextuality to both preparations
and measurements, without requiring the assumption of outcome-determinism. Indeed, we treat
all measurements on an equal footing: no notion of "sharpness" is presumed for them, hence no putative
justification of outcome-determinism from sharpness is sought. As a result, unlike the CSW framework,
we do not require Specker's principle (or the exclusivity principle) -- that pairwise exclusive
measurement events must all be mutually exclusive -- as a fundamental constraint on (sharp) measurement
events in any operational theory describing the experiment. All this allows us, for the case of quantum
theory, to deal with nonprojective (or unsharp) measurements and resolve the pathologies they
lead to in traditional approaches. Our noncontextuality inequalities are robust to the presence
of noise in the experimental procedures, whether they are measurements or preparations, and are
applicable to operational theories that need not be quantum.
