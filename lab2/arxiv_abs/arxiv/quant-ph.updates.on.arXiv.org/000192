We study the dynamics of quantum dissension for three qubit states in various dissipative channels
such as amplitude damping, dephasing and depolarizing. Our study is solely based on Markovian environments
where quantum channels are without memory and each qubit is coupled to its own environment. We start
with mixed GHZ, mixed W, mixture of separable states, a mixed biseparable state, as the initial states
and mostly observe that the decay of quantum dissension is asymptotic in contrast to sudden death
of quantum entanglement in similar environments. This is a clear indication of the fact that quantum
correlation in general is more robust against the effect of noise. However, for a given class of initial
mixed states we find a temporary leap in quantum dissension for a certain interval of time. More precisely,
we observe the revival of quantum correlation to happen for certain time period. This signifies
that the measure of quantum correlation such as quantum discord, quantum dissension, defined from
the information theoretic perspective is different from the correlation defined from the entanglement-separability
paradigm and can increase under the effect of the local noise. We also study the effects of these channels
on the monogamy score of each of these initial states. Interestingly, we find that for certain class
of states and channels, there is change from negative values to positive values of the monogamy score
with classical randomness as well as with time. This gives us an important insight in obtaining states
which are freely sharable (polygamous state) from the states which are not freely sharable (monogamous).
This is indeed a remarkable feature, as we can create monogamous states from polygamous states Monogamous
states are considered to have more signatures of quantum ness and can be used for security purpose.
