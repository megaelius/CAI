This paper highlights the importance of the assumption of locality of physical interactions, and
the concomitant necessity of the off-shell propagation of quanta between two non-relativistic
test masses in probing the quantum nature of linearized gravity in the laboratory. At the outset,
we will argue that observing the quantum nature of a system is not limited to evidencing $O\left(\hbar\right)$
corrections to a classical theory: it instead hinges upon verifying tasks that a classical system
cannot accomplish, which is the method adopted in the aforementioned tabletop experiments. We
explain the background concepts needed from quantum field theory, namely forces arising through
the exchange of virtual (off-shell) quanta, as well as the background exploited from quantum information
theory, such as Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) and entanglement witnesses.
We clarify the key assumption inherent in our evidencing experiment, namely the locality of physical
interactions, which is a generic feature of interacting systems of quantum fields around us, and
naturally incorporates micro-causality in the description of our experiment. We also present
the types of states the matter field must inhabit, putting the experiment on firm relativistic quantum
field theoretic grounds. At the end we use a non-local (but not complete action at a distance) theory
of gravity to illustrate how our mechanism may still be used to detect the qualitatively quantum
nature of a force when the scale of non-locality is finite. We find that the scale of non-locality,
including the entanglement entropy production in local/ non-local gravity, may be revealed from
the results of our experiment.
