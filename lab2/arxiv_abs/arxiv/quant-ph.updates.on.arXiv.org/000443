We provide a study of various quantum phase transitions occurring in the XY Heisenberg chain in a
transverse magnetic field using the Meyer-Wallach (MW) measure of (global) entanglement. Such
a measure, while being readily evaluated, is a multipartite measure of entanglement as opposed
to more commonly used bipartite measures. Consequently, we obtain analytic expression of the measure
for finite-size systems and show that it can be used to obtain critical exponents via finite-size
scaling with great accuracy for the Ising universality class. We also calculate an analytic expression
for the isotropic (XX) model and show that global entanglement can precisely identify the level-crossing
points. The critical exponent for the isotropic transition is obtained exactly from an analytic
expression for global entanglement in the thermodynamic limit. Next, the general behavior of the
measure is calculated in the thermodynamic limit considering the important role of symmetries
for this limit. The so-called oscillatory transition in the ferromagnetic regime can only be characterized
by the thermodynamic limit where global entanglement is shown to be zero on the transition curve.
Finally, the anisotropic transition is explored where it is shown that global entanglement exhibits
an interesting behavior in the finite-size limit. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that global
entanglement shows a cusp singularity across the Ising and anisotropic transition, while showing
non-analytic behavior at the XX multicritical point. It is concluded that global entanglement,
despite its relative simplicity, can be used to identify all the rich structure of the ground-state
Heisenberg chain.
