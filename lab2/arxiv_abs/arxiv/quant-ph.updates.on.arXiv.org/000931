Causal nonseparability refers to processes where events take place in a coherent superposition
of different causal orders. These may be the key resource for experimental violations of causal
inequalities and have been recently identified as resources for concrete information-theoretic
tasks. Here, we take a step forward by deriving a complete operational framework for causal nonseparability
as a resource. Our first contribution is a formal definition of quantum control of causal orders,
a stronger form of causal nonseparability (with the celebrated quantum switch as best-known example)
where the causal orders of events for a target system are coherently controlled by a control system.
We then build a resource theory -- for both generic causal nonseparability and quantum control of
causal orders -- with a physically-motivated class of free operations, based on process-matrix
concatenations. We present the framework explicitly in the mindset with a control register. However,
our machinery is versatile, being applicable also to scenarios with a target register alone. Moreover,
an important subclass of our operations not only is free with respect to causal nonseparability
and quantum control of causal orders but also preserves the very causal structure of causal processes.
Hence, our treatment contains, as a built-in feature, the basis of a resource theory of quantum causal
networks too. As applications, first, we establish a sufficient condition for pure-process free
convertibility. This imposes a hierarchy of quantum control of causal orders with the quantum switch
at the top. Second, we prove that causal-nonseparability distillation exists, i.e. we show how
to convert multiple copies of a process with arbitrarily little causal nonseparability into fewer
copies of a quantum switch. Our findings reveal conceptually new, unexpected phenomena, with both
fundamental and practical implications.
