We construct the coherent states of general order, $m$ for the ladder operators, $c(m)$ and $c^\dagger(m)$,
which act on rational deformations of the harmonic oscillator. The position wavefunctions of the
eigenvectors involve type III Hermite exceptional orthogonal polynomials. We plot energy expectations,
time-dependent position probability densities for the coherent states and for the even and odd
cat states, Wigner functions, and Heisenberg uncertainty relations. We find generally non-classical
behaviour, with one exception: there is a regime of large magnitude of the coherent state parameter,
$z$, where the otherwise indistinct position probability density separates into $m+1$ distinct
wavepackets oscillating and colliding in the potential, forming interference fringes when they
collide. The Mandel $Q$ parameter is calculated to find sub-Poissonian statistics, another indicator
of non-classical behaviour. We plot the position standard deviation and find squeezing in many
of the cases. We calculate the two-photon-number probability density for the output state when
the $m=4$, $\mu=-5$ coherent states (where $\mu$ labels the lowest weight in the superposition)
are placed on one arm of a beamsplitter. We find that it does not factorize, again indicating non-classical
behaviour. Calculation of the linear entropy for this beamsplitter output state shows significant
entanglement, another non-classical feature. We also construct linearized versions, $\tilde
c(m)$, of the annihilation operators and their coherent states and calculate the same properties
that we investigate for the coherent states. For these we find similar behaviour to the $c(m)$ coherent
states, at much smaller magnitudes of $z$, but comparable average energies.
