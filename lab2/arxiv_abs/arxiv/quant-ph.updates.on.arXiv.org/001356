A significant number of servers that constitute the Internet are to provide private data via private
communication channels to mutually anonymous registered users. Such are the server of banks, hospitals,
that providing cloud storage and many others. Replacing communication channels by maximally entangled
states is a promising idea for the Quantum-secured Internet (QI). While it is an important idea for
large distances secure communication, for the case of the mentioned class of servers pure entanglement
based solution is not only unnecessary but also opens a threat. A crack stimulating a node to generate
secure connections bluevia entanglement swapping between two hackers can cause uncontrolled
consumption of resources. Turning into positive a recently proven no-go result by M. Christandl
et al. [1] we propose a natural countermeasure to this threat. The solution bases on connections
between hub-nodes and end-users realized with states that contain secure key but do not allow for
swapping of this key. We then focus on the study of the quantum memory cost of such a scheme and prove
a fundamental lower bound on memory overhead. In particular, we show that to avoid possibility of
entanglement swapping, it is necessary to store at least twice as much of memory than it is the case
in standard quantum-repeater-based network design. For schemes employing either states with
positive partial transposition that approximates certain privates states or private states hardly
distinguishable from their attacked versions, we derive much tighter lower bounds on required
memory. Our considerations yield upper bounds on a twoway repeater rate for states with positive
partial transposition (PPT), which approximates strictly irreducible private states. As a byproduct,
we provide a lower bound on trace distance between PPT and private states, shown previously only
for private bits.
