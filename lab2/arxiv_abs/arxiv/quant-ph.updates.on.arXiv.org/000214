The exponential speedups promised by Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum computer depends crucially
on structure in both the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, and the quantum circuit $\hat{U}$ that encodes
its description. In the quest to better approximate time-evolution $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ with error
$\epsilon$, we motivate a systematic approach to understanding and exploiting structure, in a
setting where Hamiltonians are encoded as measurement operators of unitary circuits $\hat{U}$
for generalized measurement. This allows us to define a \emph{uniform spectral amplification}
problem on this framework for expanding the spectrum of encoded Hamiltonian with exponentially
small distortion. We present general solutions to uniform spectral amplification in a hierarchy
where factoring $\hat{U}$ into $n=1,2,3$ unitary oracles represents increasing structural knowledge
of the encoding. Combined with structural knowledge of the Hamiltonian, specializing these results
allow us simulate time-evolution by $d$-sparse Hamiltonians using $\mathcal{O}\left(t(d \|\hat
H\|_{\text{max}}\|\hat H\|_{1})^{1/2}\log{(t\|\hat{H}\|/\epsilon)}\right)$ queries,
where $\|\hat H\|\le \|\hat H\|_1\le d\|\hat H\|_{\text{max}}$. Up to logarithmic factors, this
is a polynomial improvement upon prior art using $\mathcal{O}\left(td\|\hat H\|_{\text{max}}+\frac{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}{\log\log{(1/\epsilon)}}\right)$
or $\mathcal{O}(t^{3/2}(d \|\hat H\|_{\text{max}}\|\hat H\|_{1}\|\hat H\|/\epsilon)^{1/2})$
queries. In the process, we also prove a matching lower bound of $\Omega(t(d\|\hat H\|_{\text{max}}\|\hat
H\|_{1})^{1/2})$ queries, present a distortion-free generalization of spectral gap amplification,
and an amplitude amplification algorithm that performs multiplication on unknown state amplitudes.
