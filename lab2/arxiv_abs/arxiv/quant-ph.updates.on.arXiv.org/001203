Models of quantum disentanglement are developed for nanometer-scale molecular charge qubits
(MCQs). A target pair of MCQs, $A$ and $B$, is prepared in a Bell state and separated for negligible
$A$-$B$ interactions. Interactions between the local environment and each target qubit unravels
the entanglement in $AB$ in the time evolution subsequent to preparation. Entanglement is quantified
in two-qubit correlation functions, and the dynamics of the loss of entanglement are characterized
as Gaussian, a behavior that cannot be captured using Markovian models. The strength of environmental
interactions is quantified using double-bit-flip energies, the energy of a bit flip in both $A$
and $B$. These energies are used to determine the time scale for the Gaussian loss of entanglement.
Dynamics are modeled in three ways: (1) using a previously-developed full model, in which both $AB$
and the environment $\mathcal{E}$ are modeled explicitly; (2) using a reduced-dynamics operator-sum
equation with a large set of exact environmental operators, in which only the dynamics of $AB$ are
calculated under the influence of $\mathcal{E}$; and (3) using a semi-analytic model, in which
the correlation functions are calculated directly as functions of explicitly-calculated double-bit-flip
energies and time. These three models yield exactly equivalent results. This paper generalizes
a previous time scale for this disentanglement, which was applicable only in the case when each MCQ
has roughly the same strength of interaction with its local environment. Here, the generalized
time scale also describes cases where the environmental interaction with one target qubit is dominant.
The generalized time scale enables the design of a fourth, approximate model: a set of only two environment
operators for the operator-sum equation, which approximates the exact model requiring numerous
environment operators.
