A given set of measurements can exhibit a variety of incompatibility relations and an intuitive
way to represent its joint measurability structure is via hypergraphs. The vertices of such a hypergraph
denote measurements and the hyperedges denote (all and only) subsets of compatible measurements.
Quantum measurements represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) can realize arbitrary
joint measurability structures. This latter fact opens up the possibility of studying generalized
contextuality a la Spekkens on joint measurability structures not realizable with projective
measurements. Here we explore the scope of joint measurability structures that are realizable
with POVMs on a qubit. We develop a technique that we term marginal surgery to obtain nontrivial joint
measurability structures starting from a set of measurements that are all compatible. We show explicit
examples of marginal surgery on a special set of qubit POVMs -- which we term planar symmetric POVMs
-- to construct joint measurability structures such as $N$-cycle and $N$-Specker scenarios for
any integer $N\geq 3$. We also show the realizability of various joint measurability structures
with $N\in\{4,5,6\}$ vertices. In particular, for the case of $N=4$ vertices, we show that all possible
joint measurability structures are realizable with qubit POVMs. We conjecture that all joint measurability
structures are realizable with qubit POVMs. This is in contrast to the arbitarily large dimension
required by the construction in R. Kunjwal et al., Phys. Rev. A 89, 052126 (2014). Incidentally,
our realization of all $N$-Specker scenarios on a qubit also renders this previous construction
maximally efficient in terms of the dimensions required for realizing arbitary joint measurability
structures with POVMs. Along the way, we also prove some new sufficiency conditions for joint measurability
of qubit POVMs.
