Models of quantum disentanglement are developed for nanometer-scale molecular charge qubits
(MCQs). Two MCQs, $A$ and $B$, are prepared in a Bell state and separated for negligible $A$-$B$ interactions.
Interactions between the local environment and each MCQ unravels $A$-$B$ entanglement during
coherent system+environment evolution. Three models are used for dynamics: (1) a previously-developed,
numerical model, in which both $AB$ and environment $\mathcal{E}$ are modeled explicitly; (2)
an exact, semi-analytic model, in which only the dynamics of $AB$ are calculated, and (3) an approximate
model developed from the semi-analytic model and assumptions about randomness in $\mathcal{E}$.
In the approximate model, the non-zero coherences of the density operator for $AB$ decay with a Gaussian
time dependence. This provides a time scale for system dynamics in the exact models as well. This
time scale is related directly to the strength of AB-$\mathcal{E}$ interaction. This time scale
describes cases where environmental interaction with one target MCQ is dominant, generalizing
a previous time scale applicable only when both MCQs have roughly the same strength of interaction
with the local environment. Entanglement is measured using two-qubit correlation functions,
the dynamics of which are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the time scale. The early-time
decay of coherences and the loss of entanglement is well-characterized as Gaussian, a behavior
that Markovian models for memoryless environments cannot capture. The approximate Gaussian model
may be used to describe the dynamics of MCQ disentanglement under the influence of environments
modeled here, as well as other environments where randomness is present.
