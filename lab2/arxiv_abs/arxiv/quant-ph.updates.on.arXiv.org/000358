Here we present a Multiple Observer Probability Analysis (MOPA) for the purpose of clarifying topics
in experimental Bell scenarios. Because Bell scenarios are interested in quantum effects between
nonlocal measurement devices, we assign an observer to each device: Alice and Bob. Given that the
observers are stationary and space-like separated, each observer is privy to different information
along their shared equi-temporal lines, and therefore, each observer is inclined to assign different
probability distributions to the same set of propositions due to informational differences due
to the disagreement about the observed order of events. The observers are obligated to update their
probability distributions on the basis of locally observed events, in this sense we see factuality
as informational locality. The MOPA shows that counterfactuality, the posing of hypothetical
if-then inquiries, is a useful tool for assessing probabilistic outcomes that are conditional
on nonlocal (or unavailable) propositions, thereby promoting the phrase "counterfactuality
is informational nonlocality" -- meaning, one imagines a nonlocal truth and calculates the hypothetical
changes it would cause to their probability distribution through Bayesian probability updating.
The MOPA arrives at the conclusion that the CHSH inequality is only nonlocally violated counterfactually
by each observer whereas local violations of the CHSH may be factual or counterfactual. We believe
the MOPA to better gel probability theory (and thus QM) with Special Relativity than does the standard
locality conditions imposed in the Bell and CHSH inequalities. The no-signaling condition is reinterpreted,
and perhaps further clarified, in the MOPA and statements about counterfactuality in QM are made.
