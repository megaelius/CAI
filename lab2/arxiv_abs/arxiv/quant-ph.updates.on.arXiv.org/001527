The EPR argued that quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of reality. So far, the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle and its extensions are all still inequalities form which hold the superior
approximate estimations, a precise estimation and environmental variables have never appeared
in any formula. With the indeterminism of observable quantities constrained by the uncertainty
principle. The question arises whether there might be some deeper reality hidden beneath quantum
mechanics, to be described by a more fundamental theory that can always predict the outcome of each
measurement with certainty, this paper by using the QCPB attempts to answer this question. As a result
of the QCPB theory, we geometrically propose an equality called quantum geomertainty relation
(QGR) to modify the uncertainty relation based on the fundamental theory QCPB to positively give
a complete description of reality that predicts the outcome of each measurement with certainty,
meanwhile, the uncertainty relation is just a derivation from this quantum geometric certainty
equality. It deals with the measurement in quantum equality for different manifolds equipped with
various mathematical or physical structure. Accordingly, the environment joins the physical
process, by taking environment variable as a geometric structure function in the QCPB into consideration,
it has naturally solved the environment problem for the measurements. We demonstrate that entanglement
term exists between the observable and the environment. Actually, the QCPB nicely explains how
the environment has an effect on the measurement which causes the unavoidable influences. Conversely,
we state that quantum mechanics is incomplete assuredly. Doubtlessly, the QCPB is surely a new way
for such complete description of reality.
