The thesis includes the original results of our articles [30, 37, 40, 42, 51, 53, 75]. A method is developed
to compute analytically entanglement measures of three-qubit pure states. Owing to it closed-form
expressions are presented for the geometric measure of entanglement for three-qubit states that
are linear combinations of four orthogonal product states. It turns out that the geometric measure
for these states has three different expressions depending on the range of definition in parameter
space and the Hilbert space of three-qubits consists of three different entangled regions. The
states that lie on joint surfaces separating different entangled regions, designated as shared
states, have particularly interesting features and are dual quantum channels for the perfect teleportation
and superdense coding [42]. A powerful method is developed to compute analytically multipartite
entanglement measures. The method uses the duality concept and creates a bijection between highly
entangled quantum states and their nearest separable states. The bijection gives explicitly the
geometric entanglement measure of arbitrary generalized W states of n qubits [30, 75]. Additionaly,
the behavior of the geometric entanglement measure of many-qubit W states is analyzed and an interpolating
formula is derived [51]. Generalized Schmidt decomposition of pure three-qubit states has four
positive and one complex coefficients. In contrast to the bipartite case, they are not arbitrary
and the largest Schmidt coefficient restricts severely other coefficients. It is derived a non-strict
inequality between three-qubit Schmidt coefficients, where the largest coefficient defines
the least upper bound for the three nondiagonal coefficients or, equivalently, the three nondiagonal
coefficients together define the greatest lower bound for the largest coefficient [53].
