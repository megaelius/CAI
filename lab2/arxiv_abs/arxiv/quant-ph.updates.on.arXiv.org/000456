We consider entanglement-assisted (EA) private communication over a quantum broadcast channel,
in which there is a single sender and multiple receivers. We divide the receivers into two sets: the
decoding set and the malicious set. The decoding set and the malicious set can either be disjoint
or can have a finite intersection. For simplicity, we say that a single party Bob has access to the
decoding set and another party Eve has access to the malicious set, and both Eve and Bob have access
to the pre-shared entanglement with Alice. The goal of the task is for Alice to communicate classical
information reliably to Bob and securely against Eve, and Bob can take advantage of pre-shared entanglement
with Alice. In this framework, we establish a lower bound on the one-shot EA private capacity. When
there exists a quantum channel mapping the state of the decoding set to the state of the malicious
set, such a broadcast channel is said to be degraded. We establish an upper bound on the one-shot EA
private capacity in terms of smoothed min- and max-entropies for such channels. In the limit of a
large number of independent channel uses, we prove that the EA private capacity of a degraded quantum
broadcast channel is given by a single-letter formula. Finally, we consider two specific examples
of degraded broadcast channels and find their capacities. In the first example, we consider the
scenario in which one part of Bob's laboratory is compromised by Eve. We show that the capacity for
this protocol is given by the conditional quantum mutual information of a quantum broadcast channel,
and so we thus provide an operational interpretation to the dynamic counterpart of the conditional
quantum mutual information. In the second example, Eve and Bob have access to mutually exclusive
sets of outputs of a broadcast channel.
