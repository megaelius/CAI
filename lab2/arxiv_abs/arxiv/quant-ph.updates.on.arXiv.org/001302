We investigate signatures of convergence for a sequence of diffusion processes on a line in conservative
force fields, stemming from potentials $U(x)\sim x^m$, $m=2n \geq 2$. This is paralleled by a transformation
of each $m$-th diffusion generator $L$ to the affiliated Schr\"{o}dinger-type operator $\hat{H}=
- D\Delta + {\cal{V}}$. The spectral "closeness" of $\hat{H}$ and the Neumann Laplacian $-\Delta_{\cal{N}}$
in the interval is analyzed for $m$ even and sufficiently large. A missing in the literature description
is given for the analogous affinity, by departing from the semigroup (pseudo-Schr\"{o}dinger)
dynamics, generated sequentially by the $m$-family of operators $\hat{H}$ with a priori chosen
Feynman-Kac potentials ${\cal{V}}(x) \sim x^m$. So defined $\hat{H}$ becomes spectrally "close"
to $-\Delta _{\cal{D}}$ for large $m$. The affiliated Langevin-driven diffusions are reconstructed
and found to provide a reliable approximation of the ergodic (drifted) Brownian motion in the interval,
with inaccessible endpoints. As a complementary topic, a classic case of diffusion in the (quartic)
double-well potential $U(x)= a x^4 - bx^2$, $a,b >0$ is invoked to elucidate the Fokker-Planck-Schr\"{o}dinger
affinity. Proceeding in reverse, the ergodic Fokker-Planck diffusion is reconstructed from the
lowest eigenfunction of $\hat{H}$, where ${\cal{V}}(x)$ actually takes a canonical (quartic)
double-well form (c.f. $U(x)$ in the above). A somewhat puzzling issue of the absence of negative
eigenvalues for $\hat{H}$ with a bistable-looking potential ${\cal{V}}(x)$ has been analyzed
in conjunction with the concept of quasi-exactly solvable Schr\"{o}dinger systems.
