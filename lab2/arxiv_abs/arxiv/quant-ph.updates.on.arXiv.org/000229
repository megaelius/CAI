We point out that the quantum dynamical map of an open quantum system can be generated by an effective
Liouville operator. The effective Liouville shows the dynamical breaking of time reversibility.
This breaking of reversibility is expressed by the effective Liouville's discrete spectrum having
negative imaginary parts. This generated dynamics of open quantum systems is capable of memory
effects described by a frequency dependence of the spectrum. When memory effects can be neglected
or smoothed out, the effective Liouville generates the well known semi-group dynamics of open systems
in the Markov approximation. The spectral analysis of the effective Liouville -with or without
memory- allows to represent the quantum dynamical map and expectation values of physical quantities
by metric expressions using complex eigenvalues and bi-orthonormal eigenmodes. The long time
dynamics is dominated by the zero-mode, which forms the stationary state of the open system. The
relaxation time scale $\tau$ is set by the inverse of the smallest negative imaginary part of the
non-vanishing effective eigenvalues of the effective Liouville. In generic cases of system-environment-coupling
this time scale $\tau$ is the relevant scale for both, the relaxation of diagonal elements (populations)
and the decay of off-diagonal elements (coherences) of an initial density matrix in the stationary
state's diagonal representation. It also sets the time scale after which the entropy tends to its
stationary value. The effective Liouville and its spectral content thus give a framework to study
the dynamic breaking of time reversibility, memory effects, decoherence, relaxation to a stationary
state and the role of entropy in open quantum systems.
