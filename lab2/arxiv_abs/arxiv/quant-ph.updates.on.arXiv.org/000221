The device-independent approach to physics is one where conclusions are drawn directly and solely
from the observed correlations between measurement outcomes. In quantum information, this approach
allows one to make strong statements about the properties of the underlying devices via the observation
of Bell-inequality-violating correlations. However, since one can only perform a finite number
of experimental trials, statistical fluctuations necessarily accompany any estimation of these
correlations. Consequently, an important gap remains between the many theoretical tools developed
for the asymptotic scenario and the experimentally obtained raw data. In particular, a sensible
way to estimate the underlying quantum distribution has so far remained elusive. Here, we provide
a set of tools to bridge this gap. Under the assumption that the experimental trials are independent
and identically distributed, our methods allow one to achieve the analog of quantum state estimation
in the device-independent setting by generating unique point estimates of the true quantum distribution.
Our numerical results further suggest that these estimates converge toward the underlying distribution
with a rate at least as good as the relative frequencies. As an application, we demonstrate how such
estimates of the underlying quantum distribution can be used to provide sensible estimates of the
amount of entanglement present in the measured system. In stark contrast with existing approach
to device-independent parameter estimations, our estimation does not require the prior knowledge
of any Bell inequality tailored for the specific property and the specific correlation of interest.
