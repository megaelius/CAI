A quantum computer has the potential to effciently solve problems that are intractable for classical
computers. Constructing a large-scale quantum processor, however, is challenging due to errors
and noise inherent in real-world quantum systems. One approach to this challenge is to utilize modularity--a
pervasive strategy found throughout nature and engineering--to build complex systems robustly.
Such an approach manages complexity and uncertainty by assembling small, specialized components
into a larger architecture. These considerations motivate the development of a quantum modular
architecture, where separate quantum systems are combined via communication channels into a quantum
network. In this architecture, an essential tool for universal quantum computation is the teleportation
of an entangling quantum gate, a technique originally proposed in 1999 which, until now, has not
been realized deterministically. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a teleported controlled-NOT
(CNOT) operation made deterministic by utilizing real-time adaptive control. Additionally,
we take a crucial step towards implementing robust, error-correctable modules by enacting the
gate between logical qubits, encoding quantum information redundantly in the states of superconducting
cavities. Such teleported operations have significant implications for fault-tolerant quantum
computation, and when realized within a network can have broad applications in quantum communication,
metrology, and simulations. Our results illustrate a compelling approach for implementing multi-qubit
operations on logical qubits within an error-protected quantum modular architecture.
