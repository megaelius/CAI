Parallel Lives (PL) is an ontological model of nature in which quantum mechanics and special relativity
are unified in a single universe with a single space-time. Point-like objects called lives are the
only fundamental objects in this space-time, and they propagate at or below c, and interact with
one another only locally at point-like events in space-time, very much like classical point particles.
The only causes and effects in the universe occur when lives meet locally, and thus the causal structure
of interaction events in space-time is Lorentz invariant. Each life traces a continuous world-line
through space-time, and experiences its own relative world, fully defined by the outcomes of past
events along its world-line (never superpositions), which are encoded in its external memory.
A quantum field comprises a continuum of lives throughout space-time, and familiar physical systems
like particles each comprise a sub-continuum of the lives of the field. Each life carries an internal
memory containing a local relative wavefunction, which is a local piece of a pure universal wavefunction,
but only the relative wavefunctions are physically real in PL, and not the universal wavefunction
in configuration space. Furthermore, while the universal wavefunction tracks the average behavior
of the lives of a system, it fails to track their individual dynamics and trajectories. There is always
a preferred separable basis, and for an irreducible physical system, each orthogonal term in this
basis is a different relative world - each containing some fraction of the lives of the system. The
relative wavefunctions in the lives' internal memories govern which lives of different systems
can meet during future local interactions, and thereby enforce entanglement correlations - including
Bell inequality violations.
