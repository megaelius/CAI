We investigate the behavior of entanglement in the ground state of a doped one-dimensional lattice,
where the particles interact via the quantum t-J model, which can be obtained from the Hubbard Hamiltonian
with large onsite interactions. For different values of the electron concentration, the rich phase
diagram exhibits both polynomial and exponential decay of bipartite quantum entanglement, with
increasing lattice distance. This respectively characterizes the properties of the Luttinger
liquid and the electron-hole phase separation regions of the phase diagram. Interestingly, at
low electron concentration, where the spin-gap opens, the ground state turns out to be a long-ranged
resonating valence bond gas. We observe that the phase diagram remains qualitatively unchanged
even when additional next-nearest-neighbor spin couplings are introduced, though the phase boundaries
are dependent on the relative strength between the nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions,
which the decay patterns of entanglement can capture. A key finding of the study relates to the genuine
multipartite entanglement of the ground state of the model at low electron densities. We observe
that for fixed values of the electron density, multipartite entanglement remains immutable under
perturbative or sudden changes of system parameters, a phenomenon termed as adiabatic freezing.
The phenomenon is absent in the anisotropic undoped limit of the system. It is to be noted that multipartite
entanglement, in general, is sensitive to external perturbation, as observed in several systems,
and hitherto, no freezing behavior has been reported.
