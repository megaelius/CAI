For parameter estimation from an $N$-component composite quantum system, it is known that a separable
preparation leads to a mean-squared estimation error scaling as $1/N$ while an entangled preparation
can in some conditions afford a smaller error with $1/N^2$ scaling. This quantum superefficiency
is however very fragile to noise or decoherence, and typically disappears with any small amount
of random noise asymptotically at large $N$. To complement this asymptotic characterization,
we characterize how the estimation efficiency evolves as a function of the size $N$ of the entangled
system and its degree of entanglement. We address a generic situation of qubit phase estimation,
also meaningful for frequency estimation. Decoherence is represented by the broad class of noises
commuting with the phase rotation, which includes depolarizing, phase-flip, and thermal quantum
noises. In these general conditions, explicit expressions are derived for the quantum Fisher information
quantifying the ultimate achievable efficiency for estimation. We confront at any size $N$ the
efficiency of the optimal separable preparation to that of an entangled preparation with arbitrary
degree of entanglement. We exhibit the $1/N^2$ superefficiency with no noise, and prove its asymptotic
disappearance at large $N$ for any non-vanishing noise configuration. For maximizing the estimation
efficiency, we characterize the existence of an optimum $N_{\rm opt}$ of the size of the entangled
system along with an optimal degree of entanglement. For nonunital noises, maximum efficiency
is usually obtained at partial entanglement. Grouping the $N$ qubits into independent blocks formed
of $N_{\rm opt}$ entangled qubits restores at large $N$ a nonvanishing efficiency that can improve
over that of $N$ independent qubits optimally prepared. One inactive qubit in the entangled probe
sometimes is most efficient for estimation.
