The ability to accurately predict the finite temperature properties of realistic quantum solids
is central to uncovering new phases and engineering materials with novel properties. Nonetheless,
there remain comparatively few many-body techniques capable of elucidating the finite temperature
physics of solids from first principles. In this work, we take a significant step towards developing
such a technique by generalizing our previous, fully ab initio finite temperature Auxiliary Field
Quantum Monte Carlo (FT-AFQMC) method to model periodic solids and employing it to uncover the finite
temperature physics of periodic hydrogen chains. Based upon our calculations of these chains'
many-body thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions, we outline their metal-insulator
and magnetic ordering as a function of both H-H bond distance and temperature. At low temperatures
approaching the ground state, we observe both metal-insulator and ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic
crossovers at bond lengths between 0.5 and 0.75 {\AA}. We then demonstrate how this low-temperature
ordering evolves into a metallic phase with decreasing magnetic order at higher temperatures.
By comparing the features we observe to those previously seen in one-dimensional, half-filled
Hubbard models at finite temperature and in ground state hydrogen chains, interestingly, we identify
signatures of the Pomeranchuk effect in hydrogen chains for the first time and show that spin and
charge excitations that typically arise at distinct temperatures in the Hubbard model are indistinguishably
coupled in these systems. Beyond qualitatively revealing the many-body phase behavior of hydrogen
chains, our efforts shed light on the further theoretical developments that will be required to
construct the phase diagrams of the more complex transition metal, lanthanide, and actinide solids
of longstanding interest to physicists.
