Tunnelling is one of the most paradigmatic and evocative phenomena of quantum physics, underlying
processes such as photosynthesis and nuclear fusion, as well as devices ranging from SQUID magnetometers
to superconducting qubits for quantum computers. The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel,
however, has remained controversial since the first attempts to calculate it, which relied on the
group delay. It is now well understood that this delay (the arrival time of the transmitted wave packet
peak at the far side of the barrier) can be smaller than the barrier thickness divided by the speed
of light, without violating causality. There have been a number of experiments confirming this,
and even a recent one claiming that tunnelling may take no time at all. There have also been efforts
to identify another timescale, which would better describe how long a given particle spends in the
barrier region. Here we present a direct measurement of such a time, studying Bose-condensed $^{87}$Rb
atoms tunnelling through a 1.3-${\mu}$m thick optical barrier. By localizing a pseudo-magnetic
field inside the barrier, we use the spin precession of the atoms as a clock to measure the time it takes
them to cross the classically forbidden region. We find a traversal time of 0.62(7) ms and study its
dependence on incident energy. In addition to finally shedding light on the fundamental question
of the tunnelling time, this experiment lays the groundwork for addressing deep foundational questions
about history in quantum mechanics: for instance, what can we learn about where a particle was at
earlier times by observing where it is now?
