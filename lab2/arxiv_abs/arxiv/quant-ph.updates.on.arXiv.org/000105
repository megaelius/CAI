In this PhD thesis the ancient question of determinism ('Does every event have a cause ?') will be
re-examined. In the philosophy of science and physics communities the orthodox position states
that the physical world is indeterministic: quantum events would have no causes but happen by irreducible
chance. Arguably the clearest theorem that leads to this conclusion is Bell's theorem. The commonly
accepted 'solution' to the theorem is 'indeterminism', in agreement with the Copenhagen interpretation.
Here it is recalled that indeterminism is not really a physical but rather a philosophical hypothesis,
and that it has counterintuitive and far-reaching implications. At the same time another solution
to Bell's theorem exists, often termed 'superdeterminism' or 'total determinism'. Superdeterminism
appears to be a philosophical position that is centuries and probably millennia old: it is for instance
Spinoza's determinism. If Bell's theorem has both indeterministic and deterministic solutions,
choosing between determinism and indeterminism is a philosophical question, not a matter of physical
experimentation, as is widely believed. If it is impossible to use physics for deciding between
both positions, it is legitimate to ask which philosophical theories are of help. Here it is argued
that probability theory - more precisely the interpretation of probability - is instrumental for
advancing the debate. It appears that the hypothesis of determinism allows to answer a series of
precise questions from probability theory, while indeterminism remains silent for these questions.
From this point of view determinism appears to be the most reasonable assumption, after all.
