Schwinger Keldysh field theory is a widely used paradigm to study non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum
many-body systems starting from a thermal state. We extend this formalism to describe non-equilibrium
dynamics of quantum systems starting from arbitrary initial many-body density matrices. We show
how this can be done for both Bosons and Fermions, and for both closed and open quantum systems, using
additional sources coupled to bilinears of the fields at the initial time, calculating Green's
functions in a theory with these sources, and then taking appropriate set of derivatives of these
Green's functions w.r.t. initial sources to obtain physical observables. The set of derivatives
depend on the initial density matrix. The physical correlators in a dynamics with arbitrary initial
conditions do not satisfy Wick's theorem, even for non-interacting systems. However our formalism
constructs intermediate ``n-particle Green's functions'' which obey Wick's theorem and provide
a prescription to obtain physical correlation functions from them. This allows us to obtain analytic
answers for all physical many body correlation functions of a non-interacting system even when
it is initialized to an arbitrary density matrix. We use these exact expressions to obtain an estimate
of the violation of Wick's theorem, and relate it to presence of connected multi-particle initial
correlations in the system. We illustrate this new formalism by calculating density and current
profiles in many body Fermionic and Bosonic open quantum systems initialized to non-trivial density
matrices. We have also shown how this formalism can be extended to interacting many body systems.
