Given a non-maximally entangled state, an operationally significant question is to quantitatively
assess as to what extent the state is away from the maximally entangled state, which is of importance
in evaluating the efficacy of the state for its various uses as a resource. It is this question which
is examined in this paper for two-qubit pure entangled states in terms of different entanglement
measures like Negativity (N), Logarithmic Negativity (LN), and Entanglement of Formation (EOF).
Although these entanglement measures are defined differently, to what extent they differ in quantitatively
addressing the earlier mentioned question has remained uninvestigated. Theoretical estimate
in this paper shows that an appropriately defined parameter characterizing the fractional deviation
of any given entangled state from the maximally entangled state in terms of N is quite different from
that computed in terms of EOF with their values differing up to ~ 15 % for states further away from the
maximally entangled state. Similarly, the values of such fractional deviation parameters estimated
using the entanglement measures LN and EOF, respectively, also strikingly differ among themselves
with the maximum value of this difference being around 23 %. This analysis is complemented by illustration
of these differences in terms of empirical results obtained from a suitably planned experimental
study. Thus, such appreciable amount of quantitative non-equivalence between the entanglement
measures in addressing the experimentally relevant question considered in the present paper highlights
the requirement of an appropriate quantifier for such intent. We indicate directions of study that
can be explored towards finding such a quantifier.
