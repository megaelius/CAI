We review the literature on the Pauli equation and its current density, discussing the progression
from the original phenomenological version of Pauli to its derivation by $\text{L\'{e}vy-Leblond}$
from a linearization of the $\text{Schr\"{o}dinger}$ equation. It was established conclusively
by $\text{L\'{e}vy-Leblond}$'s work that the spin of a spin-1/2 particle such as an electron is
non-relativistic in nature, contrary to what was often stated following Dirac's derivation of
a relativistic wave equation, and his subsequent demonstration that Pauli's spin interaction
term appeared in the non-relativistic limit. In this limit, the Gordon decomposition of the associated
probability current density was found to contain a spin-dependent term. Such a term does not follow,
however, from the usual derivation of the current density from the Pauli equation, although various
physically motivated but otherwise ad hoc explanations were put forward to account for it. We comment
on the only exception to these of which we are aware implying the spin term in the current was in fact
non-relativistic in nature. However, the earlier work of $\text{L\'{e}vy-Leblond}$ had already
shown, with no additional assumptions, that this term was a prominent feature of the current density
derived from his equation. Hence, just as with the spin itself, the spin current was non-relativistic,
claims to the contrary notwithstanding. We present a somewhat simplified derivation of the $\text{L\'{e}vy-Leblond}$
equation and its current density, commenting on possibilities for experimental work that might
indicate measurable consequences of the spin term in the current density.
