Geometric Algebra, championed by David Hestenes as a universal language for physics, was used as
a framework for the quantum mechanics of interacting qubits by Chris Doran, Anthony Lasenby and
others. Independently of this, Joy Christian in 2007 claimed to have refuted Bell's theorem with
a local realistic model of the singlet correlations by taking account of the geometry of space as
expressed through Geometric Algebra. A series of papers culminated in a book Christian (2014).
The present paper first explores Geometric Algebra as a tool for quantum information and explains
why it did not live up to its early promise. In summary, whereas the mapping between 3D geometry and
the mathematics of one qubit is already familiar, Doran and Lasenby's ingenious extension to a system
of entangled qubits does not yield new insight but just reproduces standard QI computations in a
clumsy way. The tensor product of two Clifford algebras is not a Clifford algebra. The dimension
is too large, an ad hoc fix is needed, several are possible. I further analyse two of Christian's earliest,
shortest, least technical, and most accessible works (Christian 2007, 2011), exposing conceptual
and algebraic errors. Since 2015, when the first version of this paper was posted to arXiv, Christian
has published ambitious extensions of his theory in RSOS (Royal Society - Open Source), arXiv:1806.02392,
and in IEEE Access, arXiv:1405.2355. Another paper submitted to a pure mathematics journal, arXiv:1908.06172,
presents a counter-example to the famous Hurwitz theorem that the only division algebras are R,
C, H, and O. Christian's counter-example is the Clifford Algebra Cl(0, 3) which is not a division
algebra at all. At the end of the paper, I run through the new elements of the new papers.
