We employ a quasirandom methodology, recently developed by Martin Roberts, to estimate the separability
probabilities, with respect to the Bures (minimal monotone/statistical distinguishability)
measure, of generic two-qubit and two-rebit states. This procedure, based on generalized properties
of the golden ratio, yielded, in the course of almost seventeen billion iterations (recorded at
intervals of five million), two-qubit estimates repeatedly close to nine decimal places to $\frac{25}{341}
=\frac{5^2}{11 \cdot 31} \approx 0.073313783$. In the Bures two-rebit case, we do not presently
perceive an exact value (rational or otherwise) for an estimate of 0.15709623, based on over twenty-three
billion iterations. We re-examine, strongly supporting, conjectures that the HS qubit-qutrit
and rebit-retrit separability probabilities are $\frac{27}{1000}=\frac{3^3}{2^3 \cdot 5^3}$
and $\frac{860}{6561}= \frac{2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 43}{3^8}$, respectively. The Bures qubit-qutrit
case--for which Khvedelidze and Rogojin gave an estimate of 0.0014--is analyzed too, with quasirandom
sequences of dimension 144. The value of $\frac{1}{715}=\frac{1}{5 \cdot 11 \cdot 13} \approx
0.00139860$ is a well-fitting value to an estimate of 0.00139884. Interesting values ($\frac{16}{12375}
=\frac{4^2}{3^2 \cdot 5^3 \cdot 11}$ and $\frac{625}{109531136}=\frac{5^4}{2^{12} \cdot 11^2
\cdot 13 \cdot 17}$) are advanced for the HS and Bures qubit-qudit ($2 \times 4$) PPT-probabilities.
We find certain generalized qubit-qutrit scenarios in which the master Lovas-Andai formulas play
the same separability function roles as in their original generalized two-qubit settings--obtaining
in two distinct 10-dimensional rebit-retrit cases, the same probability of $\frac{256-168 \zeta
(3)}{\pi ^2}-38+48 \log (2) \approx 0.747925$.
