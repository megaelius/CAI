Trapped charged particles are among the leading qubit candidates for quantum computing technologies.
However, our ability to interconnect arrays of particles in different traps is a significant hurdle
in scaling trapped charged particle quantum computing. One approach explored to overcome this
problem is to use a solid state conducting wire to mediate the coulomb interaction between particles
in different traps. Additionally, there is strong interest in interfacing trapped charged particle
qubits with solid state superconducting qubits to develop hybrid systems which benefit from the
complementary strengths of the two technologies. For studies related to these fields, a trapped
charged particle inducing charge on a conductor has long been modeled using equivalent circuit
elements. The equivalent circuit element approach is popular partly due to the appeal of a model
for analyzing systems using simple electronic components. As a result, a body of theoretical work
is founded on this approach. However, careful consideration of the model leads to inconsistencies.
We show that this suggests many studies based on the model should be reviewed. Our result removes
a potential road-block for future studies aiming to use conductors to connect independent arrays
of charged particles, or to interface charged particles with solid-state qubit technologies.
In addition, for the specific case of two trapped charges interacting via a conducting coupling
system, we introduce an alternative way to use linear relationships, which reproduces results
from other works that are not based on the circuit-element model. This method may be useful in trouble-shooting
real experimental designs and assessing the accuracy of different theoretical models.
