We initiate a systematic study to provide upper bounds on device-independent key, secure against
a non-signaling adversary (NSDI), distilled by a wide class of operations, currently used in both
quantum and non-signaling device-independent protocols. These operations consist of a direct
measurements on the devices followed by Local Operations and Public Communication (MDLOPC). We
employ the idea of "squashing" on the secrecy monotones, which provide upper bounds on the key rate
in secret key agreement (SKA) scenario, and show that squashed secrecy monotones are the upper bounds
on NSDI key. As an important instance, an upper bound on NSDI key rate called "squashed non-locality",
has been constructed. It exhibits several important properties, including convexity, monotonicity,
additivity on tensor products, and asymptotic continuity. Using this bound, we identify numerically
a domain of two binary inputs and two binary outputs non-local devices for which the squashed non-locality
is zero, and therefore one can not distil key from them via MDLOPC operations. These are mixtures
of Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) and anti-PR box with the weight of PR box less than $80\%$. This example
confirms the intuition that non-locality need not imply secrecy in the non-signaling scenario.
The approach is general, describing how to construct other tighter yet possibly less computable
upper bounds. Our technique for obtaining upper bounds is based on the non-signaling analog of quantum
purification: the complete extension. This extension provides the ultimate eavesdropping power
with the minimal consumption of eavesdropper's memory and, as we prove, yields equivalent security
conditions as previously known in the literature.
