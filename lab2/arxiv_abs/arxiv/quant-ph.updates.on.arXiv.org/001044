We study the coupled atom-molecular quantized ring vortices of 87Rb Bose-Einstein Condensates
(BEC) trapped in a rotating three dimensional (3D) anisotropic cylindrical trap both in time independent
and time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii approaches. For atom to molecular conversion and vice-versa
two-photon Raman photoassociation scheme has been used.Atomic and molecular stationary state
solutions show that the number of quantized vortices formed for different combinations of radial
(n) and axial (nz)quantum numbers (at a fixed azimuthal quantum number l=2) is (n+1)(nz+1). We have
considered both spontaneous and induced decays and compared the results.The out of phase oscillation
of atomic and molecular numbers in two vortex states both in presence and absence of external decays
is the signature of coherence due to the atom-molecular coupling. This coherence is also implemented
in the evolution of coupled atomic and molecular vortices. Intensity of molecular ring vortices
grows with progress in time in expense of that of atomic ring vortices and vice versa. It is found that
the intensity of the coupled atomic and molecular ring vortices starts oscillation out of phase
during evolution. Dependence of the atom-molecular conversion efficiency and the lifetime of
the system on the laser intensity of photoassociation lasers and the total number of atoms in two
different vortex states reveals that formation of atom-molecular coupled vortices and the efficiency
of formation can be controlled by varying these parameters. Linear stability analysis of vortex
states as a function of different system parameters shows that the atomic vortices are more stable
than molecular vortices and the stable atomic and molecular vortices can be achieved by controlling
these parameters.
