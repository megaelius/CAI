Some predictions regarding pre- and post-selected states are far-reaching, thereby requiring
validation with standard quantum measurements in addition to the customary weak measurements
used so far, as well as other advanced techniques. We go further pursuing this goal, proposing two
thought experiments which incorporate novel yet feasible validation methods of unconventional
light-matter interactions. An excited atom traverses a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) under
a special combination of pre- and post-selection. In the first experiment, photons emitted by the
superposed atom, after being hit by two laser beams, are individually counted. Despite the interaction
having definitely taken place, the numbers of photons emitted from each arm of the MZI are predicted,
at the ensemble level, to be different from those expected with standard stimulated emission. In
the second experiment, the atom spontaneously emits a photon while still in the MZI. This photon
later serves as a strong measurement of the atom's energy upon hitting a photographic plate. The
experiment is repeated to enable an interference effect of the emitted photons. Interestingly,
the latter gives the appearance that the photons have been emitted by the atom from a position much
farther from the two MZI arms L and R, as if in a "phantom arm" R'. These experiments also emphasize
the key role of anomalous weak values in determining light-matter interactions. In fact, they present
a straightforward realization of an entity we term counter-particles, namely pre- and post-selected
states acting as if they have negative physical variables such as mass and energy. The novel verification
methods we suggest for testing these predictions resemble weak measurements in some aspects, yet
result from definite atomic transitions verified by the detected photons.
