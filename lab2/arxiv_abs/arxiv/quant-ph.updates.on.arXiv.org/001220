Decoherence is all around us. Every quantum system that interacts with the environment is doomed
to decohere. The preservation of quantum coherence is one of the major challenges faced in quantum
technologies, but its use as a resource is very promising and can lead to various operational advantages,
for example in quantum algorithms. Hence, much work has been devoted in recent years to quantify
the coherence present in a system. In the present paper, we formulate the quantum resource theory
of dynamical coherence. The underlying physical principle we follow is that the free dynamical
objects are those that cannot preserve or distribute coherence. This leads us to identify classical
channels as the free elements in this theory. Consequently, even the quantum identity channel is
not free as all physical systems undergo decoherence and hence, the preservation of coherence should
be considered a resource. In our work, we introduce four different types of free superchannels (analogous
to MIO, DIO, IO, and SIO) and discuss in detail two of them, namely, dephasing-covariant incoherent
superchannels (DISC), maximally incoherent superchannels (MISC). The latter consists of all
superchannels that do not generate non-classical channels from classical ones. We quantify dynamical
coherence using channel-divergence-based monotones for MISC and DISC. We show that some of these
monotones have operational interpretations as the exact, the approximate, and the liberal coherence
cost of a quantum channel. Moreover, we prove that the liberal asymptotic cost of a channel is equal
to a new type of regularized relative entropy. Finally, we show that the conversion distance between
two channels under MISC and DISC can be computed using a semi-definite program (SDP).
