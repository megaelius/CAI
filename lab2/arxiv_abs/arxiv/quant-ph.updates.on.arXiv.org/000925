The split-operator algorithm combined with the dynamic Fourier method is a popular approach for
quantum dynamics in systems with separable kinetic and potential energies because it is explicit,
easy to implement, and preserves many geometric invariants of the exact evolution. Although the
standard version has only second-order accuracy, it can be recursively symmetrically composed
to obtain geometric integrators of arbitrary even order of accuracy in the time step. We have implemented
such integrators for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics in the diabatic basis using the triple-jump,
Suzuki-fractal, and several non-recursive "optimal" compositions of the second-order split-operator
algorithm. Because the automatically generated splitting coefficients are redundant, we reduce
the computational cost by pruning these coefficients and lower memory requirements by identifying
unique coefficients. The composed integrators are exactly unitary, symplectic, symmetric, time-reversible,
and stable regardless of the accuracy of the solution. The order of convergence and preservation
of geometric properties are justified analytically and confirmed numerically on a two-surface
NaI model in the diabatic representation. Efficiency of higher-order algorithms is sometimes
questioned because the number of splitting steps grows exponentially with the order. Yet, we show
that, if higher accuracy is desired, higher-order integrators become the most efficient; a 600-fold
speedup compared to the second-order split-operator method and a 17000-fold speedup compared
to the trapezoidal rule (the Crank-Nicolson method) was observed for convergence error of 10$^{-10}$.
