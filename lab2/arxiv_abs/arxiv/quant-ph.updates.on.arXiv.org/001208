Here, we are concerned with comparing estimation schemes for the quantum state under continuous
measurement (quantum trajectories), namely quantum state filtering and, as introduced by us [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 115, 180407 (2015)], quantum state smoothing. Unfortunately, the cumulative errors
in the most typical simulations of quantum trajectories with a total time of simulation $T$ can reach
orders of $T \Delta t$. Moreover, these errors may correspond to deviations from valid quantum evolution
as described by a completely positive map. Here we introduce a higher-order method that reduces
the cumulative errors in the complete positivity of the evolution to of order $T\Delta t^2$, whether
for linear (unnormalised) or nonlinear (normalised) quantum trajectories. Our method also guarantees
that the discrepancy in the average evolution between different detection methods (different
`unravellings', such as quantum jumps or quantum diffusion) is similarly small. This equivalence
is essential for comparing quantum state filtering to quantum state smoothing, as the latter assumes
that all irreversible evolution is unravelled, although the estimator only has direct knowledge
of some records. In particular, here we compare, for the first time, the average difference between
filtering and smoothing conditioned on an event of which the estimator lacks direct knowledge:
a photon detection within a certain time window. We find that the smoothed state is actually {\em
less pure}, both before and after the time of the jump. Similarly, the fidelity of the smoothed state
with the `true' (maximal knowledge) state is also lower than that of the filtered state before the
jump. However, after the jump, the fidelity of the smoothed state is higher.
