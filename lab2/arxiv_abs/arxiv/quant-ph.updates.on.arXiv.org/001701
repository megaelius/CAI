Though sunlight is by far the most abundant renewable energy source available to humanity, its dilute
and variable nature has kept efficient ways to collect, store, and distribute this energy tantalisingly
out of reach. Turning the incoherent energy supply of sunlight into a coherent laser beam would overcome
several practical limitations inherent in using sunlight as a source of clean energy: laser beams
travel nearly losslessly over large distances, and they are effective at driving chemical reactions
which convert sunlight into chemical energy. Here we propose a bio-inspired blueprint for a novel
type of laser with the aim of upgrading unconcentrated natural sunlight into a coherent laser beam.
Our proposed design constitutes an improvement of several orders of magnitude over existing comparable
technologies: state-of-the-art solar pumped lasers operate above 1000 suns (corresponding to
1000 times the natural sunlight power). In order to achieve lasing with the extremely dilute power
provided by sunlight, we here propose a laser medium comprised of molecular aggregates inspired
by the architecture of photosynthetic complexes. Such complexes, by exploiting a highly symmetric
arrangement of molecules organized in a hierarchy of energy scales, exhibit a very large internal
efficiency in harvesting photons from a power source as dilute as natural sunlight. Specifically,
we consider substituting the reaction center of photosynthetic complexes in purple bacteria with
a suitably engineered molecular dimer composed of two strongly coupled chromophores. We show that
if pumped by the surrounding photosynthetic complex, which efficiently collects and concentrates
solar energy, the core dimer structure can reach population inversion, and reach the lasing threshold
under natural sunlight. The design principles proposed here will also pave the way for developing
other bio-inspired quantum devices.
