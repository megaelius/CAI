The interaction between light and matter can be utilized to qualitatively alter physical properties
of materials. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have explored this possibility of controlling
matter by light based on driving many-body systems via strong classical electromagnetic radiation,
leading to a time-dependent Hamiltonian for electronic or lattice degrees of freedom. To avoid
inevitable heating effects in driven interacting systems, pump-probe setups with ultrashort
laser pulses have so far been used to study transient light-induced modifications of material properties.
Here, we pursue yet another direction of controlling quantum matter by modifying quantum fluctuations
of its electromagnetic environment. In contrast to earlier proposals focusing on light-enhanced
electron-electron interactions, we consider a dipolar quantum many-body system embedded in a
cavity composed of metal mirrors, and formulate a theoretical framework to manipulate its equilibrium
properties on the basis of quantum light-matter interaction. Owing to the strong coupling of polarizable
material excitations to the cavity electric field, the cavity confinement leads to the hybridization
of different types of the fundamental excitations, including dipolar phonons, cavity photons,
and plasmons in metal mirrors. We show that this hybridization qualitatively alters the nature
of the collective excitations and can be used to control energy-level structures in a wide range
of systems. Most notably, in quantum paraelectric materials, we show that the cavity-induced softening
of infrared optical phonons enhances the ferroelectric phase. Our findings suggest an intriguing
possibility of inducing a superradiant-type quantum phase transition via the light-matter coupling
without external pumping. We also discuss possible applications to collective excitations in
molecular materials and excitonic devices.
