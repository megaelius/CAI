The positivity and nonadditivity of the one-letter quantum capacity (maximum coherent information)
$Q^{(1)}$ is studied for two simple examples of complementary quantum channel pairs $(B,C)$. They
are produced by a process, we call it gluing, for combining two or more channels to form a composite.
(We discuss various other forms of gluing, some of which may be of interest for applications outside
those considered in this paper.) An amplitude-damping qubit channel with damping probability
$0\leq p \leq 1$ glued to a perfect channel is an example of what we call a generalized erasure channel
characterized by an erasure probability $\lambda$ along with $p$. A second example, using a phase-damping
rather than amplitude-damping qubit channel, results in the dephrasure channel of Ledtizky et
al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 160501 (2018)]. In both cases we find the global maximum and minimum of
the entropy bias or coherent information, which determine $Q^{(1)}(B_g)$ and $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$,
respectively, and the ranges in the $(p,\lambda)$ parameter space where these capacities are positive
or zero, confirming previous results for the dephrasure channel. The nonadditivity of $Q^{(1)}(B_g)$
for two channels in parallel occurs in a well defined region of the $(p,\lambda)$ plane for the amplitude-damping
case, whereas for the dephrasure case we extend previous results to additional values of $p$ and
$\lambda$ at which nonadditivity occurs. For both cases, $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$ shows a peculiar behavior:
When $p=0$, $C_g$ is an erasure channel with erasure probability $1-\lambda$, so $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$
is zero for $\lambda \leq 1/2$. However, for any $p>0$, no matter how small, $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$ is positive,
though it may be extremely small, for all $\lambda >0$. Despite the simplicity of these models we
still lack an intuitive understanding of the nonadditivity of $Q^{(1)}(B_g)$ and the positivity
of $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$.
