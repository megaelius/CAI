We propose a realizable circuit QED architecture for engineering states of a superconducting resonator
off-resonantly coupled to an ancillary superconducting qubit. The qubit-resonator dispersive
interaction together with a microwave drive applied to the qubit gives rise to a Kerr resonator with
two-photon driving that enables us to efficiently engineer the quantum state of the resonator such
as generation of the Schrodinger cat states for resonator-based universal quantum computation.
Moreover, the presented architecture is easily scalable for solving optimization problem mapped
into the Ising spin glass model, and thus served as a platform for quantum annealing. Although various
scalable architecture with superconducting qubits have been proposed for realizing quantum annealer,
the existing annealers are currently limited to the coherent time of the qubits. Here, based on the
protocol for realizing two-photon driven Kerr resonator in three-dimensional circuit QED (3D
cQED), we propose a flexible and scalable hardware for implementing quantum annealer that combines
the advantage of the long coherence times attainable in 3D cQED and the recently proposed resonator
based Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. In the proposed resonator based LHZ annealer, each spin
is encoded in the subspace formed by two coherent state of 3D microwave superconducting resonator
with opposite phase, and thus the fully-connected Ising model is mapped onto the network of the resonator
with local tunable three-resonator interaction. This hardware architecture provides a promising
physical platform for realizing quantum annealer with improved coherence.
