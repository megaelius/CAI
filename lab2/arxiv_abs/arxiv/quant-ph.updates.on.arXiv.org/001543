We derive generalised uncertainty relations (GURs) for angular momentum and spin in the smeared-space
model of quantum geometry. The model implements a minimum length and a minimum linear momentum,
and recovers both the generalised uncertainty principle (GUP) and the extended uncertainty principle
(EUP) within a single formalism. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of these results
for particles with extrinsic and intrinsic angular momentum, and obtain generalisations of the
canonical ${\rm so(3)}$ and ${\rm su(2)}$ algebras. We find that, although ${\rm SO(3)}$ symmetry
is preserved on three-dimensional slices of an enlarged phase space, individual subcomponents
of the generalised generators obey nontrivial subalgebras. These give rise to GURs for angular
momentum while leaving the canonical commutation relations intact except for a simple rescaling,
$\hbar \rightarrow \hbar + \beta$. The value of the new parameter, $\beta \simeq \hbar \times 10^{-61}$,
is determined by the ratio of the dark energy density to the Planck density. Here, we assume the former
to be of the order of the Planck length and the latter to be of the order of the de Sitter momentum $\sim
\hbar\sqrt{\Lambda}$, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant. In the smeared-space model,
$\hbar$ and $\beta$ are interpreted as the quantisation scales for matter and geometry, respectively,
and a quantum state vector is associated with the spatial background. We show that this also gives
rise to a rescaled Lie algebra for generalised spin operators, together with associated subalgebras
that are analogous to those for orbital angular momentum. Remarkably, consistency of the algebraic
structure requires the quantum state associated with a flat background to be fermionic, with spin
eigenvalues $\pm \beta/2$. Finally, the modified spin algebra leads to GURs for spin measurements.
