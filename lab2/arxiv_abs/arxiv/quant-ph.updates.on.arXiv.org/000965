Quantum resource theories have been widely studied to systematically characterize the non-classicality
of quantum systems. Most resource theories focus on quantum states and study the interconversion
between different states. Although quantum channels are generally used as the tool for resource
manipulation, such a manipulation ability can be naturally regarded as a generalized quantum resource,
leading to an open research direction in the resource theories of quantum channels. Various resource-theoretic
properties of channels have been investigated, however, without treating channels themselves
as operational resources that can also be manipulated and converted. In this Letter, we address
this problem by first proposing a general resource framework for quantum channels and introducing
resource monotones based on general distance quantifiers of channels. We study the interplay with
state resource theories by relating resource monotones of a quantum channel to its manipulation
power of the state resource. Regarding channels as operational resources, we introduce asymptotic
channel distillation and dilution, the most important tasks in an operational resource theory,
and show how to bound the conversion rates with channel resource monotones. Finally, we apply our
results to quantum coherence as an example and introduce the coherence of channels, which characterizes
the coherence generation ability of channels. We consider asymptotic channel distillation and
dilution with maximally incoherent operations and find it asymptotically irreversible, in contrast
to the asymptotic reversibility of the coherence of states.
