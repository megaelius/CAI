Recent years have witnessed the remarkable discovery that the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) model unifies a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems, and
moreover is the foundation of adiabatic quantum computing and a subject of study in neuromorphic
computing. Through these connections, QUBO models lie at the heart of experimentation carried
out with quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems and neuromorphic computers developed by
IBM and are actively being explored for their research and practical applications by Google and
Lockheed Martin in the commercial realm and by Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the public sector. Computational experience
is being amassed by both the classical and the quantum computing communities that highlights not
only the potential of the QUBO model but also its effectiveness as an alternative to traditional
modeling and solution methodologies. This tutorial discloses the basic features of the QUBO model
that give it the power and flexibility to encompass the range of applications that have thrust it
into prominence. We show how many different types of constraints arising in practice can be embodied
within the "unconstrained" QUBO formulation in a very natural manner using penalty functions,
yielding exact model representations in contrast to the approximate representations produced
by customary uses of penalty functions. Each step of generating such models is illustrated in detail
by simple numerical examples, to highlight the convenience of using QUBO models in numerous settings.
We also describe recent innovations for solving QUBO models that offer a rich potential for integrating
classical and quantum computing and for applying these models in machine learning.
