The Hamiltonian of a linearly driven two level system, or qubit, in a rotating frame contains non-commuting
terms that oscillate at twice the drive frequency, $\omega$. This makes the task of analytically
finding the qubit's time evolution nontrivial. For near-resonant drives, the application of the
rotating wave approximation (RWA), which is suitable only for drives whose amplitude $H_1$ is small
compared to $\omega$ and varies slowly on the time scale of $1/\omega$, yields a simple Hamiltonian
that can be integrated easily. We present a series of corrections to the RWA Hamiltonian in $1/\omega$,
resulting in an effective Hamiltonian whose time evolution is accurate also for strong and time-dependent
drives, assuming $H_1(t) \lesssim \omega$. As a result of the envelope $H_1$ being time dependent,
our effective Hamiltonian is a function not only of $H_1(t)$ itself but also of its time derivatives.
Our effective Hamiltonian is obtained through a recurrence relation which we derive using a combination
of a Magnus expansion of the original rotating-frame Hamiltonian and a Taylor series of $H_1$, called
the Magnus-Taylor expansion. Using the same tool, we further derive kick operators that complete
our effective Hamiltonian treatment for non-analyticities of the drive envelope. The time evolution
generated by the effective Hamiltonian agrees with the exact time evolution at periodic points
in time. For the most important correction (first order in $1/\omega$), we find that besides the
well-known Bloch-Siegert shift there are two competing terms that depend on the first derivative
of the envelope, $\dot H_1$, and on the detuning, $\Delta$.
