The extraordinary sensitivity of the output field of an optical cavity to small quantum-scale displacements
has led to breakthroughs such as the first detection of gravitational waves \cite{LIGO,LIGODC}
and of the motions of quantum ground-state cooled mechanical oscillators \cite{Teufel2011,Chan2011}.
While heterodyne detection of the cavity field preserves asymmetries which provide a key signature
that mechanical oscillators has attained the quantum regime, detection of a rotating quadrature
of the light averages out important quantum correlations, yielding a weaker signal and lower sensitivity
than homodyne detection. In turn, homodyning, detects a single optical quadrature, but loses the
important quantum sideband asymmetries. In the present work we present and experimentally demonstrate
a technique, involving judicious construction of the autocorrelators of the output current using
filter functions, which can restore the lost correlations (whether classical or quantum), drastically
augmenting the useful information extracted: the filtering adjusts for moderate errors in the
locking phase of the local oscillator, allowing efficient single-shot measurement of hundreds
of different field quadratures and rapid mapping of detailed features from a simple heterodyne
trace. One may also control whether the correlations are recovered in isolation or interfere with
the usual stationary heterodyne sidebands. In the latter case we obtain a spectrum of hybrid homodyne-heterodyne
character, with motional sidebands of combined amplitudes comparable to homodyne. We term such
recovery of lost heterodyne correlations with filter functions r-heterodyning: although investigated
here in a thermal regime, its robustness and generality represents a promising new approach to sensing
of quantum-scale displacements.
