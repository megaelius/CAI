Entropy is necessary and sufficient to characterize the order of work content for equal energetic
(EE) states in the asymptotic limit. However, for the finite quantum systems, the relation is not
so linear and requires detail investigation. Toward this, we have considered a resource theoretic
framework taking the energy preserving operations (EPO) as free, to compare the amount of extractable
work from two different quantum states under a thermodynamic process. For EPO, majorization becomes
a necessary and sufficient criterion for state transformation. So ergotropy (work extraction
from a closed system by unitary), min free energy $F_0$ (single shot work extraction in the presence
of bath) and entropy, all become independent monotones under this process. For the EE states which
are not connected by any EPO (i.e., not majorized) the order between work and entropy breaks down
unlike in the asymptotic limit. In this framework, any state following Gibbsian distribution for
$\beta \in [-\infty, \infty]$ can be taken as a free state having maximum entropy and zero ergotropy.
Work extraction from a closed system under unitary leads to the passive state from where no further
work can be extracted. We have shown that the passive state energy is a concave function and for EE
states it becomes proportional to the ergotropy in absolute sense. Invariance of the passive state
energy under unitary action on the given state makes it an entanglement measure for the pure bipartite
states. Due to the non additivity of passive state energy for the different system Hamiltonians,
one can generate Vidal$'$s monotones which would give the optimal probability for pure entangled
state transformation. This measure also quantifies the ergotropic gap which is employed to distinguish
some specific classes of three-qubit pure entangled states.
