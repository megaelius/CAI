We present the model of one-dimensional chain of two-level artificial atoms driven with dc field
and quantum light simultaneously in strong coupling regime. The interaction of atoms with light
leads to entanglement of electron and photon states (dressing of the atoms). The driving via dc field
leads to the Bloch oscillations (BO) in the chain of dressed atoms. We considered the mutual influence
of dressing and BO and show that scenario of oscillations dramatically differs from predicted by
the Jaynes-Cummings and Bloch-Zener models. We study the evolution of the population inversion,
tunneling current, photon probability distribution, mean number of photons, photon number variance
and show the influence of BO on the quantum-statistical characteristics of light. For example,
collapse-revivals picture and vacuum Rabi-oscillations are strongly modulated with Bloch frequency.
As a result, quantum properties of light and degree of electron-photon entanglement become controllable
via adiabatic dc field turning. On the other hand, the low-frequency tunneling current depends
on the quantum light statistics (in particular, for coherent initial state it is modulated accordingly
the collapse-revivals picture). The developed model is universal with respect to the physical
origin of artificial atom and frequency range of atom-light interaction. The model is adapted to
the 2D-heterostructures (THz frequencies), semiconductor quantum dots (optical range), and
Josephson junctions (microwaves). The data for numerical simulations are taken from recently
published experiments. The obtained results open a new ways in quantum state engineering and nano-photonic
spectroscopy.
