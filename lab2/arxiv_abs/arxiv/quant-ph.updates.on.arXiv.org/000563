In this work we theoretically consider possibilities of the detection of single photon quantum
superposition if before detection by photo plate only one superposition arm can directly quantum
dynamically interact with two-level quantum systems appropriate for corresponding non-disturbing
stimulated emission or absorption. If photo plate is relatively close or if life time of the excited
state is relatively large (so that there is no excited state decay before detection) this photo plate
will effectively detect interference effects, i.e. superposition. (Exactly quantum dynamically
here is an entangled state of the super-system, photon and two two-level systems. But it can be effectively
consistently approximated by superposition of the photon only.) If photo plate is relatively distant
or if life time of the excited state is relatively short (so that there is excited state decay and new
spontaneously emitted photon appearance before detection) this photo plate will effectively
detect interference effects (absence, i.e. superposition absence. (Exactly quantum dynamically
here is an entangled state of the super-system, initial photon, two two-level systems and new photon.
But it can be effectively consistently approximated by entangled state of super-system, initial
photon and new photon, but not on the superposition of the initial photon only.) All this can be very
interesting for discussion of the quantum detection, i.e. measurement procedure (as "unique,
Magellan straight| between "Atlantic ocean" of the classical macroscopic decoherent phenomena
and "Great, Pacific ocean" of the microscopic quantum superposition (entanglement) phenomena).
