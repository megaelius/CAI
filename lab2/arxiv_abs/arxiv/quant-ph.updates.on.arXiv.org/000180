In real-time quantum feedback protocols, the record of a continuous measurement is used to stabilize
a desired quantum state. Recent years have seen highly successful applications in a variety of well-isolated
micro-systems, including microwave photons and superconducting qubits. By contrast, the ability
to stabilize the quantum state of a tangibly massive object, such as a nanomechanical oscillator,
remains a difficult challenge: The main obstacle is environmental decoherence, which places stringent
requirements on the timescale in which the state must be measured. Here we describe a position sensor
that is capable of resolving the zero-point motion of a solid-state, nanomechanical oscillator
in the timescale of its thermal decoherence, a critical requirement for preparing its ground state
using feedback. The sensor is based on cavity optomechanical coupling, and realizes a measurement
of the oscillator's displacement with an imprecision 40 dB below that at the standard quantum limit,
while maintaining an imprecision-back-action product within a factor of 5 of the Heisenberg uncertainty
limit. Using the measurement as an error signal and radiation pressure as an actuator, we demonstrate
active feedback cooling (cold-damping) of the 4.3 MHz oscillator from a cryogenic bath temperature
of 4.4 K to an effective value of 1.1$\pm$0.1 mK, corresponding to a mean phonon number of 5.3$\pm$0.6
(i.e., a ground state probability of 16%). Our results set a new benchmark for the performance of
a linear position sensor, and signal the emergence of engineered mechanical oscillators as practical
subjects for measurement-based quantum control.
