We show what are the lessons to be learned from the gedankenexperiments presented by Frauchiger
and Renner (claim that quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself), and Brukner
(a no-go theorem for observer independent facts). One has to remember Bohr's remark "the unambiguous
account of proper quantum phenomena must, in principle, include a description of all relevant features
of experimental arrangement", which specifically to the gedankenexperiments means: in all your
quantum mechanical thinking about measurements, think in terms of the full quantum measurement
theory. The theory sees measurement as composed of two stages: pre-measurement (entanglement,
i.e. quantum correlation, of the measured system with the pointer variable), and next decoherence
via interaction with an environment, which is irreversible (cannot be undone) and leaves the system
in a classical mixture of the eigenstates of the measured observable. Pre-measurements can in principle
be undone. We can have a quantum-marker-quantum-eraser situation. The gedankenexperiments are
effectively scenarios of this type. The process described by Frauchiger and Renner is possible
only if the 'Friends' of the 'Wigners' constrain themselves to pre-measurements. We present an
alternative gedankenexperiment, which involves hypothetical 'outcomes' obtained by the Friends
during their pre-measurements. The 'outcomes' are shown to be at odds with quantum mechanical predictions.
The experiment involves Friend-Wigner relation, which is concurrent with the original ideas of
E.P. Wigner. Friends (pre-)measure, Wigners check what happened.
