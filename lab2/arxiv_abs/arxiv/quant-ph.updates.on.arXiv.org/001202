We introduce a novel private-key quantum money scheme where the verification of a note is based on
Sampling Matching, a problem in one-way communication complexity model introduced by Kumar et
al. [Nature Communications 10, Article number: 4152]. Our scheme involves the Bank who prepares
the notes by independently and uniformly selecting multiple secret strings and encodes them into
the single photon states. The notes are then distributed among untrusted holders. To carry out a
transaction, the holder sends the note to the honest local verifiers of the Bank. The verifier runs
the local test on the holder's note and obtains classical measurement outcomes. This is forwarded
to the Bank who declares the validity of the note based on the outcomes received. The key aspects of
our money scheme include: verification step requiring single round classical interaction between
the local verifier and the Bank; fixed verification circuit that uses only passive linear optical
components; re-usability of each note in our scheme which grows linearly with the size of note; and
an unconditional security against any adversary trying to forge the bank note while tolerating
the noise of upto 21.4$\%$. Finally, we describe the practical implementation technique of our
scheme using weak coherent states which requires only a single beam splitter and 2 threshold detectors
irrespective of the size of the note. Previous schemes have required the number of optical components
which increase with the note size. This considerable reduction of components in our scheme enables
us to go to arbitrarily large input sizes, thus showcasing the ability to reach higher robustness
experimentally, something not feasible for any existing money scheme with the current technology.
