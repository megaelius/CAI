Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are a framework for exact or approximate optimization that have widespread
application in quantum information theory. We introduce a new method for using reductions to construct
integrality gaps for SDPs. These are based on new limitations on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy
in approximating two particularly important sets in quantum information theory, where previously
no $\omega(1)$-round integrality gaps were known: the set of separable (i.e. unentangled) states,
or equivalently, the $2 \rightarrow 4$ norm of a matrix, and the set of quantum correlations; i.e.
conditional probability distributions achievable with local measurements on a shared entangled
state. In both cases no-go theorems were previously known based on computational assumptions such
as the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) which asserts that 3-SAT requires exponential time to
solve. Our unconditional results achieve the same parameters as all of these previous results (for
separable states) or as some of the previous results (for quantum correlations). In some cases we
can make use of the framework of Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer (LRS) to establish integrality gaps for
any SDP, not only the SoS hierarchy. Our hardness result on separable states also yields a dimension
lower bound of approximate disentanglers, answering a question of Watrous and Aaronson et al. These
results can be viewed as limitations on the monogamy principle, the PPT test, the ability of Tsirelson-type
bounds to restrict quantum correlations, as well as the SDP hierarchies of Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri,
Navascues-Pironio-Acin and Berta-Fawzi-Scholz.
