Quantum coherence is one of the most important resources in quantum information theory. Indeed,
preventing the loss of coherence is one of the most important technical challenges obstructing
the development of large-scale quantum computers. Recently, there has been substantial progress
in developing mathematical resource theories of coherence, paving the way towards its quantification
and control. To date however, these resource theories have only been mathematically formalised
within the realms of convex-geometry, information theory, and linear algebra. This approach is
limited in scope, and makes it difficult to generalise beyond resource theories of coherence for
single system quantum states. In this paper we take a complementary perspective, showing that resource
theories of coherence can instead be defined purely compositionally, that is, working with the
mathematics of process theories, string diagrams and category theory. This new perspective offers
several advantages: i) it unifies various existing approaches to the study of coherence, ii) it
provides, for the first time, a general treatment of the multi-partite setting, iii) it generalises
immediately to the case of quantum channels, measurements, and instruments rather than just states,
and iv) it directly extends to arbitrary process theories, for example, generalised probabilistic
theories and Spekkens toy model---providing the ability to operationally characterise coherence
rather than relying on specific mathematical features of quantum theory for its description. More
importantly, by providing a new, complementary, perspective on the resource of coherence, this
work opens the door to the development of novel tools which would not be accessible from the linear
algebraic mind set.
