Symmetry protected topological (SPT) states have boundary 't Hooft anomalies that obstruct an
effective boundary theory realized in its own dimension with UV completion and an on-site $G$-symmetry.
In this work, yet we show that a certain anomalous non-on-site $G$ symmetry along the boundary becomes
on-site when viewed as an extended $H$ symmetry, via a suitable group extension $1\to K\to H\to G\to1$.
Namely, a non-perturbative global (gauge/gravitational) anomaly in $G$ becomes anomaly-free
in $H$. This guides us to construct exactly soluble lattice path integral and Hamiltonian of symmetric
gapped boundaries, always existent for any SPT state in any spacetime dimension $d \geq 2$ of any
finite symmetry group, including on-site unitary and anti-unitary time-reversal symmetries.
The resulting symmetric gapped boundary can be described either by an $H$-symmetry extended boundary
of bulk $d \geq 2$, or more naturally by a topological emergent $K$-gauge theory with a global symmetry
$G$ on a 3+1D bulk or above. The excitations on such a symmetric topologically ordered boundary can
carry fractional quantum numbers of the symmetry $G$, described by representations of $H$. (Apply
our approach to a 1+1D boundary of 2+1D bulk, we find that a deconfined gauge boundary indeed has spontaneous
symmetry breaking with long-range order. The deconfined symmetry-breaking phase crosses over
smoothly to a confined phase without a phase transition.) In contrast to known gapped interfaces
obtained via symmetry breaking (either global symmetry breaking or Anderson-Higgs mechanism
for gauge theory), our approach is based on symmetry extension. More generally, applying our approach
to SPT, topologically ordered gauge theories and symmetry enriched topologically ordered (SET)
states, leads to generic boundaries/interfaces constructed with a mixture of symmetry breaking,
symmetry extension, and dynamical gauging.
