Resource identification and quantification is an essential element of both classical and quantum
information theory. Entanglement is one of these resources, arising when quantum communication
and nonlocal operations are expensive to perform. In the first part of this thesis we quantify the
effective entanglement when operations are additionally restricted. For an important class of
errors we find a linear relationship between the usual and effective higher dimensional generalization
of concurrence, a measure of entanglement. In the second chapter we focus on nonlocality in the presence
of superselection rules, where we propose a scheme that may be used to activate nongenuinely multipartite
nonlocality with multiple copies of the state. We show that whenever the number of particles is insufficient,
the genuinely multipartite nonlocality is degraded to nongenuinely multipartite. While in the
first few chapters we focus on understanding the resources present in quantum states, in the final
part we turn the picture around and instead treat operations themselves as a resource. We provide
our observers with free access to classical operations - ie. those that cannot detect or generate
quantum coherence. We show that the operation of interest can then be used to either generate or detect
quantum coherence if and only if it violates a particular commutation relation. Using the relative
entropy, the commutation relation provides us with a measure of nonclassicality of operations.
We show that the measure is a sum of two contributions, the generating power and the distinguishing
power, each of which is separately an essential ingredient in quantum communication and information
processing. The measure also sheds light on the operational meaning of quantum discord, which we
show can be interpreted as the difference in superdense coding capacity between a quantum state
and a classical state.
