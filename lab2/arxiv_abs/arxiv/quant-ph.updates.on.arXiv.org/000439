We address the question whether the super-Heisenberg scaling for quantum estimation is realizable.
We unify the results of two approaches. In the first one, the original system is compared with its
copy rotated by the parameter dependent dynamics. If the parameter is coupled to the one-body part
of the Hamiltonian the precision of its estimation is known to scale at most as $N^{-1}$ (Heisenberg
scaling) in terms of the number of elementary subsystems used, $N$. The second approach considers
fidelity at criticality often leading to an apparent super-Heisenberg scaling. However, scaling
of time needed to ensure adiabaticity of the evolution brings back the the Heisenberg limit. We illustrate
the general theory on a ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain which exhibits such super-Heisenberg
scaling of fidelity around the critical value of the magnetic field. Even an elementary estimator
represented by a single-site magnetization already outperforms the Heisenberg behavior providing
the $N^{-1.5}$ scaling. In this case Fisher information sets the ultimate scaling as $N^{-1.75}$
which can be saturated by measuring magnetization on all sites simultaneously. We discuss universal
scaling predictions of the estimation precision offered by such observables, both at zero and finite
temperatures, and support them with numerical simulations in the model. We provide an experimental
proposal of realization of the considered model via mapping the system to ultra-cold bosons in periodically
shaken optical lattice. We explicitly derive that the Heisenberg limit is recovered when time needed
for preparation of quantum states involved is taken into acocunt.
