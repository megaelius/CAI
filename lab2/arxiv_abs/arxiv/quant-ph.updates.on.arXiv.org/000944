We investigate analytically and numerically the steady-state entanglement and coherence of two
coupled qubits each interacting with a local boson or fermion reservoir, based on the Bloch-Redfield
master equation beyond the secular approximation. We find that there is non-vanishing steady-state
coherence in the nonequilibrium scenario, which grows monotonically with the nonequilibrium
condition quantified by the temperature difference or chemical potential difference of the two
baths. The steady-state entanglement in general is a non-monotonic function of the nonequilibrium
condition as well as the bath parameters in the equilibrium setting. We also find that weak inter-qubit
coupling and high base temperature or chemical potential of the baths can strongly suppress the
steady-state entanglement and coherence, regardless of the strength of the nonequilibrium condition.
On the other hand, the energy detuning of the two qubits, when used in a compensatory way with the nonequilibrium
condition, can lead to significant enhancement of the steady-state entanglement in some parameter
regimes. In addition, the qubits typically have a stronger steady-state entanglement when coupled
to fermion baths exchanging particle with the system than boson baths exchanging energy with the
system under similar conditions. We also discussed the possible experimental realization of measuring
the steady state entanglement and coherence for coupled qubits systems in nonequilibrium environments.
These results offer some general guidelines for optimizing the steady-state entanglement and
coherence in the coupled qubit system and may find potential applications in quantum information
technology.
