We ask the question how the (weak) equivalence principle established in classical gravitational
physics should be reformulated and interpreted for massive quantum objects that may also have internal
degrees of freedom (dof). This inquiry is necessary because even elementary concepts like a classical
trajectory are not well defined in quantum physics -- trajectories originating from quantum histories
become viable entities only under stringent decoherence conditions. From this investigation
we posit two logically and operationally distinct statements of the equivalence principle for
quantum systems: Version A: The probability distribution of position for a free-falling particle
is the same as the probability distribution of a free particle, modulo a mass-independent shift
of its mean. Version B: Any two particles with the same velocity wave-function behave identically
in free fall, irrespective of their masses. Both statements apply to all quantum states, including
non-classical ones, and also for composite particles with quantum internal dof. We also investigate
the consequences of the interaction between internal and external dof induced by free fall. For
a class of initial states, we find a dephasing for the translational dof, namely, the suppression
of the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in the position basis. We also find a gravitational
phase shift in the reduced density matrix of the internal dof that does not depend on the particle's
mass. For classical states, the phase shift has a natural classical interpretation in terms of gravitational
red-shift and special relativistic time-dilation.
