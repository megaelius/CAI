Clustering is a powerful machine learning technique that groups "similar" data points based on
their characteristics. Many clustering algorithms work by approximating the minimization of
an objective function, namely the sum of within-the-cluster distances between points. The straightforward
approach involves examining all the possible assignments of points to each of the clusters. This
approach guarantees the solution will be a global minimum, however the number of possible assignments
scales quickly with the number of data points and becomes computationally intractable even for
very small datasets. In order to circumvent this issue, cost function minima are found using popular
local-search based heuristic approaches such as k-means and hierarchical clustering. Due to their
greedy nature, such techniques do not guarantee that a global minimum will be found and can lead to
sub-optimal clustering assignments. Other classes of global-search based techniques, such as
simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithms may offer better quality results but
can be too time consuming to implement. In this work, we describe how quantum annealing can be used
to carry out clustering. We map the clustering objective to a quadratic binary optimization (QUBO)
problem and discuss two clustering algorithms which are then implemented on commercially-available
quantum annealing hardware, as well as on a purely classical solver "qbsolv." The first algorithm
assigns N data points to K clusters, and the second one can be used to perform binary clustering in
a hierarchical manner. We present our results in the form of benchmarks against well-known k-means
clustering and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed techniques.
