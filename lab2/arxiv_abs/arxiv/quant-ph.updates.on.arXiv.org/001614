We consider a qubit coupled to another system (its environment), and discuss the relationship between
the effects of subjecting the qubit to either a dynamical decoupling sequence of unitary operations,
or a sequence of projective measurements. We give a formal statement concerning equivalence of
a sequence of coherent operations on a qubit, precisely operations from a minimal set $\left\{\mathbf{I}_Q,\hat{\sigma}_x\right\}$,
and a sequence of projective measurements of $\hat{\sigma}_x$ observable. Using it we show that
when the qubit is subjected to $n$ such successive projective measurements at certain times, the
expectation value of the {\it last} measurement can be expressed as a linear combination of expectation
values of $\hat{\sigma}_x$ observed after subjecting the qubit to dynamical decoupling sequences
of $\pi$ pulses, with $k\leq n$ of them applied at subsets of these times. Performing a sequence of
measurements on the qubit gives then access to the same properties of the environment and qubit-environment
coupling that are affecting the coherence observed in a dynamical decoupling experiment. Analysing
the latter has been widely used to characterize the environmental dynamics (perform so-called
noise spectroscopy), so our result shows how the results obtained with dynamical decoupling based
protocols are related to those that can be obtained just by performing multiple measurements on
the qubit. We also discuss in more detail the application of the general result to the case of the qubit
undergoing pure dephasing, and outline possible extensions to higher-dimensional (a qudit or
multiple qubits) systems.
