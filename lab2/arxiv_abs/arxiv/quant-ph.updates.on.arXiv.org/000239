Spin qubits based on silicon quantum dots provide a promising platform for large-scale quantum
computation because of their compatibility with conventional CMOS manufacturing and the long
spin coherence times accessible using 28Si enriched material. These dual motivations have driven
significant progress in recent years, with high-fidelity single-qubit gates now realised in a
variety of structures and two-qubit gates demonstrated using silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor
quantum dots. To reach the goal of a scalable error-corrected quantum processor, however, it will
be necessary to control many qubits in parallel, while performing parity measurements on multiple
qubits. For spin qubits, spin resonance techniques are a convenient path to parallel two-axis control,
and recent proposals have shown how Pauli spin blockade can be used to realize parity measurements
for error detection. Despite this, silicon qubit implementations have so far focused on either
single-spin resonance control via magnetic or electric-dipole fields, or control and measurement
via voltage-pulse detuning in the two-spin singlet-triplet basis, but not both simultaneously.
Here, we demonstrate an integrated device platform incorporating a SiMOS double quantum dot that
is capable of single-spin addressing and control via electron spin resonance (ESR), combined with
high-fidelity spin readout in the singlet-triplet basis. We attain a single-shot readout fidelity
of 98% and fully characterize the system Hamiltonian in the singlet-triplet basis. Because singlet-triplet
readout can provide high fidelities at much lower magnetic fields than single-spin reservoir-based
readout, it allows ESR control to be performed at lower microwave frequencies, which will benefit
scalability. Our results provide an important step toward the realisation of 1D and 2D silicon QD
architectures that are capable of fault-tolerant error correction.
