The decoherence interpretation of quantum measurements is applied to Wigner's friend experiments.
A framework in which all the experimental outcomes arise from unitary evolutions is proposed. Within
it, a measurement is not completed until an uncontrolled environment monitorizes the state composed
by the system, the apparatus and the observer. The (apparent) wave-function collapse and the corresponding
randomness result from tracing out this environment; it is thus the ultimate responsible for the
emergence of definite outcomes. Two main effects arise from this fact. First, external interference
measurements, trademark of Wigner's friend experiments, modify the memory records of the internal
observers; this framework provides a univocal protocol to calculate all these changes. Second,
it can be used to build a consistent scenario for the recenly proposed extended versions of the Wigner's
friend experiment. Regarding [D. Frauchiger and R. Renner, {\em Quantum theory cannot consistently
describe the use of itself}, Nat. Comm. {\bf 9}, 3711 (2018)], this framework shows that the agents'
claims become consistent if the changes in their memories are properly taken into account. Furthermore,
the particular setup discussed in [C. Brukner, {\em A no-go theorem for observer-indepdendent
facts}, Entropy {\bf 20}, 350 (2018)] cannot be tested against the decoherence framework, because
it does not give rise to well-defined outcomes according to this formalism. A variation of this setup,
devised to fill this gap, makes it possible to assign joint truth values to the observations made
by all the agents. This framework also narrows down the requisites for such experiments, making
them virtually impossible to apply to conscious (human) beings. Notwithstanding, it also opens
the door to future relizations on quantum machines.
