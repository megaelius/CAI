The time-dependent restricted-active-space self-consistent-field (TD-RASSCF) method is formulated
based on the TD variational principle. In analogy with the configuration-interaction singles
(CIS), singles-and-doubles (CISD), singles-doubles-and-triples (CISDT) methods in quantum
chemistry, the TD-RASSCF-S, -SD, and -SDT methods are introduced as extensions of the TD-RASSCF
dou- bles (-D) method [Phys. Rev. A 87, 062511 (2013)]. Based on an analysis of the numerical cost
and test calculations for one-dimensional (1D) models of atomic helium, beryllium, and carbon,
it is shown that the TD-RASSCF-S and -D methods are computationally feasible for systems with many
electrons and more accurate than the TD Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and TDCIS methods. In addition to the
discussion of methodology, an analysis of electron dynamics in the high-order harmonic generation
(HHG) process is presented. For the 1D beryllium atom, a state-resolved analysis of the HHG spectrum
based on the time-independent HF orbitals shows that while only single-orbital excitations are
needed in the region below the cutoff, single- and double-orbital excitations are es- sential beyond,
where accordingly the single-active-electron (SAE) approximation and the TDCIS method break
down. On the other hand, the TD-RASSCF-S and -D methods accurately describe the multi-orbital excitation
processes throughout the entire region of the HHG spectrum. For the 1D carbon atom, our calculations
show that multi-orbital excitations are essential in the HHG process even below the cutoff. Hence,
in this test system a very accurate treatment of electron correlation is required. The TD-RASSCF-S
and -D approaches meet this demand, while the SAE approximation and the TDCIS method are inadequate.
