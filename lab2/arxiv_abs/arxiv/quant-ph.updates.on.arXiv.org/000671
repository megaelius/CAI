In this work, we study the impact of quantum entanglement on the two-point correlation function
and the associated primordial power spectrum of mean square vacuum fluctuation in a bipartite quantum
field theoretic system. The field theory that we consider is the effective theory of axion field
arising from Type IIB string theory compactified to four dimensions. We compute the expression
for the power spectrum of vacuum fluctuation in three different approaches, namely (1) field operator
expansion (FOE) technique with the quantum entangled state, (2) reduced density matrix (RDM) formalism
with mixed quantum state and (3) the method of non-entangled state (NES). For massless axion field,
in all these three formalism, we reproduce, at the leading order, the exact scale-invariant power
spectrum which is well known in the literature. We observe that due to quantum entanglement, the
sub-leading terms for these thee formalisms are different. Thus, such correction terms break the
degeneracy among the analysis of the FOE, RDM and NES formalisms in the super-horizon limit. On the
other hand, for massive axion field, we get a slight deviation from scale invariance and exactly
quantify the spectral tilt of the power spectrum in small scales. Apart from that, for massless and
massive axion field, we find distinguishable features of the power spectrum for the FOE, RDM, and
NES on the large scales, which is the result of quantum entanglement. We also find that such large-scale
effects are comparable to or greater than the curvature radius of the de Sitter space. Most importantly,
in the near future, if experiments probe for early universe phenomena, one can detect such small
quantum effects. In such a scenario, it is possible to test the implications of quantum entanglement
in primordial cosmology.
