Quantum computation requires qubits that can be coupled and realized in a scalable manner, together
with universal and high-fidelity one- and two-qubit logic gates \cite{DiVincenzo2000, Loss1998}.
Strong effort across several fields have led to an impressive array of qubit realizations, including
trapped ions \cite{Brown2011}, superconducting circuits \cite{Barends2014}, single photons\cite{Kok2007},
single defects or atoms in diamond \cite{Waldherr2014, Dolde2014} and silicon \cite{Muhonen2014},
and semiconductor quantum dots \cite{Veldhorst2014}, all with single qubit fidelities exceeding
the stringent thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computing \cite{Fowler2012}.
Despite this, high-fidelity two-qubit gates in the solid-state that can be manufactured using
standard lithographic techniques have so far been limited to superconducting qubits \cite{Barends2014},
as semiconductor systems have suffered from difficulties in coupling qubits and dephasing \cite{Nowack2011,
Brunner2011, Shulman2012}. Here, we show that these issues can be eliminated altogether using
single spins in isotopically enriched silicon\cite{Itoh2014} by demonstrating single- and two-qubit
operations in a quantum dot system using the exchange interaction, as envisaged in the original
Loss-DiVincenzo proposal \cite{Loss1998}. We realize CNOT gates via either controlled rotation
(CROT) or controlled phase (CZ) operations combined with single-qubit operations. Direct gate-voltage
control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a switchable exchange interaction
that is employed in the two-qubit CZ gate. The speed of the two-qubit CZ operations is controlled
electrically via the detuning energy and we find that over 100 two-qubit gates can be performed within
a two-qubit coherence time of 8 \textmu s, thereby satisfying the criteria required for scalable
quantum computation.
