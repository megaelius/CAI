Utilizing an adiabatic approximation method a bipartite qudit-oscillator Hamiltonian is explicitly
studied for low spin values in both strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes. The quasiprobability
densities on the hybrid factorized phase space are introduced. Integrating over a sector of the
composite phase space, the quasiprobability distributions of the complementary subsystem are
recovered. In the strong coupling regime the qudit entropy displays a pattern of quasiperiodic
collapses and revivals, where the locally minimum nonzero configurations appearing at rational
fractions of the revival time correspond to the spin kitten states. Starting with a bipartite factorizable
initial state the evolution to the nonclassical transitory spin kitten states are displayed via
the diagonal spin PQ-representation. The formation of transient spin kitten states is further
substantiated by constructing the spin tomogram that employs the positive definite probability
distributions embodying the diagonal elements of the corresponding density matrix in an arbitrarily
rotated frame. As another manifestation of nonclassicality the emergence of the spin squeezed
states during the bipartite evolution is observed. In the ultrastrong coupling domain a large number
of interaction dependent modes and their harmonics are generated. The consequent randomization
of the phases eliminates the quasiperiodicity of the system which is now driven towards a stabilization
of the entropy accompanied with stochastic fluctuations around its stabilized value. Both in the
strong and ultrastrong coupling realms antibunching of the photoemission events are realized
particularly for the small spin values.
