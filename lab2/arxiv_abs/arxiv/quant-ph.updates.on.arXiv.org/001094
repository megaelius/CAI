The complexity of experimental quantum information processing devices is increasing rapidly,
requiring new approaches to control them. In this paper, we address the problems of practically
modeling and controlling an integrated optical waveguide array chip, a technology expected to
have many applications in telecommunications and optical quantum information processing. This
photonic circuit can be electrically reconfigured, but only the output optical signal can be monitored.
As a result, the conventional control methods cannot be naively applied. Characterizing such a
chip is challenging for three reasons. First, there are uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonian
describing the chip. Second, we expect distortions of the control voltages caused by the chip's
electrical response, which cannot be directly observed. Finally, there are imperfections in the
measurements caused by losses from coupling the chip externally to optical fibers. We developed
a deep neural network approach to solve these problems. The architecture is designed specifically
to overcome the aforementioned challenges using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network as
the central component. The Hamiltonian is estimated as a blackbox, while the rules of quantum mechanics
such as state evolution is embedded in the structure as a whitebox. The resulting overall graybox
model of the chip shows good performance both quantitatively in terms of the mean square error and
qualitatively in terms of the predicted waveforms. We use this neural network to solve a classical
and a quantum control problem. In the classical application we find a control sequence to approximately
realize a time-dependent output power distribution. For the quantum application we obtain the
control voltages to realize a target set of quantum gates. The proposed method is generic and can
be applied to other systems that can only be probed indirectly.
