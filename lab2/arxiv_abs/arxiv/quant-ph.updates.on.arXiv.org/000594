In our previous work [1] we described quantized computation using Horn clauses and based the semantics,
dubbed as entanglement semantics as a generalization of denotational and distribution semantics,
and founded it on quantum probability by exploiting the key insight classical random variables
have quantum decompositions. Towards this end we built a Hilbert space of H-interpretations and
a corresponding non commutative von Neu- mann algebra of bounded linear operators [2]. In this work
we extend the formalism using second-quantized Horn clauses that describe processes such as Heisenberg
evolutions in optical circuits, quantum walks, and quantum filters in a formally verifiable way.
We base our system on a measure theoretic approach to handle infinite dimensional systems and demonstrate
the expressive power of the formalism by casting an algebra used to describe interconnected quantum
systems (QNET) [5] in this language. The variables of a Horn clause bounded by universal or existential
quantifiers can be used to describe parameters of optical components such as beam splitter scattering
paths, cavity detuning from resonance, strength of a laser beam, or input and output ports of these
components. Prominent clauses in this non commutative framework are Weyl predicates, that are
operators on a Boson Fock space in the language of quantum stochastic calculus, martingales and
conjugate Brownian motions compactly representing statistics of quantum field fluctuations.
We formulate the- orem proving as a quantum stochastic process, more precisely a martingale, in
Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics, a sequence of goals to be proved, on the Herbrand base.
