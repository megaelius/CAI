The concept of self-testing (or rigidity) refers to the fact that for certain Bell inequalities
the maximal violation can be achieved in an essentially unique manner. In this work we present a family
of Bell inequalities which are maximally violated by multiple inequivalent quantum realisations.
We completely characterise the quantum realisations achieving the maximal violation and we show
that each of them requires a maximally entangled state of two qubits. This implies the existence
of a new, weak form of self-testing in which the maximal violation allows us to identify the state,
but does not fully determine the measurements. From the geometric point of view the set of probability
points that saturate the quantum bound is a line segment. We then focus on a particular member of the
family and show that the self-testing statement is robust, i.e. that observing a non-maximal violation
allows us to make a quantitative statement about the unknown state. To achieve this we present a new
construction of extraction channels and analyse their performance. For completeness we provide
two independent approaches: analytical and numerical. The noise robustness, i.e. the amount of
white noise at which the bound becomes trivial, of the analytical bound is rather small (~0.06%),
but the numerical method takes us into an experimentally-relevant regime (~5%). We conclude by
investigating the amount of randomness that can be certified using these Bell violations. Perhaps
surprisingly, we find that the qualitative behaviour resembles the behaviour of rigid inequalities
like the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. This shows that at least for some device-independent
applications rigidity is not a necessary ingredient.
