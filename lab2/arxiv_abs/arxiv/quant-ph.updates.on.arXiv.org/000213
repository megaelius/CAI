In recent years, the study of heat to work conversion has been re-invigorated by nanotechnology.
Steady-state devices do this conversion without any macroscopic moving parts, through steady-state
flows of microscopic particles such as electrons, photons, phonons, etc. This review aims to introduce
some of the theories used to describe these steady-state flows in a variety of mesoscopic or nanoscale
systems. These theories are introduced in the context of idealized machines which convert heat
into electrical power (heat-engines) or convert electrical power into a heat flow (refrigerators).
In this sense, the machines could be categorized as thermoelectrics, although this should be understood
to include photovoltaics when the heat source is the sun. As quantum mechanics is important for most
such machines, they fall into the field of quantum thermodynamics. In many cases, the machines we
consider have few degrees of freedom, however the reservoirs of heat and work that they interact
with are assumed to be macroscopic. This review discusses different theories which can take into
account different aspects of mesoscopic and nanoscale physics, such as coherent quantum transport,
magnetic-field induced effects (including topological ones such as the quantum Hall effect),
and single electron charging effects. It discusses the efficiency of thermoelectric conversion,
and the thermoelectric figure of merit. More specifically, the theories presented are (i) linear
response theory with or without magnetic fields, (ii) Landauer scattering theory in the linear
response regime and far from equilibrium, (iii) Green-Kubo formula for strongly interacting systems
within the linear response regime, (iv) rate equation analysis for small quantum machines with
or without ..... (SEE THE PDF FOR THE REST OF THIS ABSTRACT)
