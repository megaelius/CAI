The scrambling of quantum information in closed many-body systems, as measured by out-of-time-ordered
correlation functions (OTOCs), has lately received considerable attention. Recently, a hydrodynamical
description of OTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits, aspects of which are conjectured
to be universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without randomness. Here we extend this approach
to systems with locally conserved quantities (e.g., energy). We do this by considering local random
unitary circuits with a conserved U$(1)$ charge and argue, with numerical and analytical evidence,
that the presence of a conservation law slows relaxation in both time ordered {\textit{and}} out-of-time-ordered
correlation functions, both can have a diffusively relaxing component or "hydrodynamic tail"
at late times. We verify the presence of such tails also in a deterministic, peridocially driven
system. We show that for OTOCs, the combination of diffusive and ballistic components leads to a
wave front with a specific, asymmetric shape, decaying as a power law behind the front. These results
also explain existing numerical investigations in non-noisy ergodic systems with energy conservation.
Moreover, we consider OTOCs in Gibbs states, parametrized by a chemical potential $\mu$, and apply
perturbative arguments to show that for $\mu\gg 1$ the ballistic front of information-spreading
can only develop at times exponentially large in $\mu$ -- with the information traveling diffusively
at earlier times. We also develop a new formalism for describing OTOCs and operator spreading, which
allows us to interpret the saturation of OTOCs as a form of thermalization on the Hilbert space of
operators.
