As of today, no one can tell when a universal quantum computer with thousands of logical quantum bits
(qubits) will be built. At present, most quantum computer prototypes involve less than ten individually
controllable qubits, and only exist in laboratories for the sake of either the great costs of devices
or professional maintenance requirements. Moreover, scientists believe that quantum computers
will never replace our daily, every-minute use of classical computers, but would rather serve as
a substantial addition to the classical ones when tackling some particular problems. Due to the
above two reasons, cloud-based quantum computing is anticipated to be the most useful and reachable
form for public users to experience with the power of quantum. As initial attempts, IBM Q has launched
influential cloud services on a superconducting quantum processor in 2016, but no other platforms
has followed up yet. Here, we report our new cloud quantum computing service -- NMRCloudQ (this http
URL), where nuclear magnetic resonance, one of the pioneer platforms with mature techniques in
experimental quantum computing, plays as the role of implementing computing tasks. Our service
provides a comprehensive software environment preconfigured with a list of quantum information
processing packages, and aims to be freely accessible to either amateurs that look forward to keeping
pace with this quantum era or professionals that are interested in carrying out real quantum computing
experiments in person. In our current version, four qubits are already usable with in average 1.26%
single-qubit gate error rate and 1.77% two-qubit controlled-NOT gate error rate via randomized
benchmaking tests. Improved control precisions as well as a new seven-qubit processor are also
in preparation and will be available later.
