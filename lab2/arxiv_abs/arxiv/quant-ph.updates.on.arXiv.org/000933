Quantum states, no matter pure states, density matrices or Wigner functions, fully describe a physical
system at a particular time. Time remains to be one of the deepest mysteries in physics for centuries.
Here we attempt to understand time via a unified approach on both space and time, under the intuition
that relativity treats space and time on an equal footing; thus we build quantum states across spacetime
instead of only on spatial slices. We no longer distinguish measurements on the same system at different
times with measurements on different systems at one time and construct spacetime states upon these
measurement statistics. As a first step towards quantum field theory, we consider how to approach
this in the continuous-variable multi-mode regime. We propose six possible definitions for spacetime
states in continuous variables, based on four different measurement processes: quadratures,
displaced parity operators, position measurements and weak measurements. They are motivated
by the pseudo-density matrix formulation among indefinite causal structures and the path integral
formalism. We show that these definitions lead to desirable properties, and suggest the differences
and similarities between spatial and temporal correlations. An experimental proposal for tomography
is suggested to demonstrate that the spacetime states we define have very strong operational meanings.
All these show that it is possible to define a continuous-variable spacetime state with multiple
desirable properties and with the possibility to apply the arsenal of continuous-variable quantum
state tools to the analysis thereof.
