Standard tripartite nonlocality and genuine tripartite nonlocality can be detected by the violations
of Mermin inequality and Svetlichny inequality, respectively. Since tripartite quantum nonlocality
has novel applications in quantum information and quantum computation, it is important to investigate
whether more than three observers can share tripartite nonlocality, simultaneously. In the present
study we answer this question in the affirmative. In particular, we consider a scenario where three
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles are spatially separated and shared between Alice, Bob and multiple
Charlies. Alice performs measurements on the first particle; Bob performs measurements on the
second particle and multiple Charlies perform measurements on the third particle sequentially.
In this scenario we investigate how many Charlies can simultaneously demonstrate standard tripartite
nonlocality and genuine tripartite nonlocality with single Alice and single Bob. The interesting
result revealed by the present study is that at most six Charlies can simultaneously demonstrate
standard tripartite nonlocality with single Alice and single Bob. On the other hand, at most two
Charlies can simultaneously demonstrate genuine tripartite nonlocality with single Alice and
single Bob. Hence, the present study shows that standard tripartite nonlocality can be simultaneously
shared by larger number of Charlies compared to genuine tripartite nonlocality in the aforementioned
scenario, which implies that standard tripartite nonlocality is more effective than genuine tripartite
nonlocality in the context of simultaneous sharing by multiple observers.
