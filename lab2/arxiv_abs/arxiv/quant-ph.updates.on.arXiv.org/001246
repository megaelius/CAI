The quantum object is in general considered as displaying both wave and particle nature. By particle
is understood an item localized in a very small volume of the space, and which cannot be simultaneously
in two disjoint regions of the space. By wave, to the contrary, is understood a distributed item,
occupying in some cases two or more disjoint regions of the space. The quantum formalism did not explain
until today the so called "collapse" of the wave function, i.e. the shrinking of the wave function
to one small region of the space, when a macroscopic object is encountered. This seems to happen in
"which way" experiments. A very appealing explanation for this behavior is the idea of a particle,
localized in some limited part of the wave-function. The present article challenges the concept
of particle. It proves in base of a variant of the Tan, Walls and Collett experiment, that this concept
leads to a situation in which the particle has to be simultaneously in two places distant from one
another, situation that contradicts the very definition of a particle. Another argument is based
on a modified version of the Afshar experiment, showing that the concept of particle is problematic.
The concept of particle makes additional difficulties when the wave-function passes through fields.
An unexpected possibility to solve these difficulties seems to arise from the cavity quantum electrodynamics
studies done recently by S. Savasta and his collaborators. It involves virtual particles. One of
these studies is briefly described here. Though, experimental results are expected, so that it
is too soon to draw conclusions whether it speaks in favor, or against the concept of particle.
