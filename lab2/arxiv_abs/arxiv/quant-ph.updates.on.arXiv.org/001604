We theoretically study the profile of a supercurrent in two-dimensional Josephson junctions with
Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (RDSOI) in the presence of a Zeeman field. Through
investigating self-biased supercurrent (so called $\varphi_0$-Josephson state), we obtain
explicit expressions for the functionality of the $\varphi_0$ state with respect to RDSOI parameters
($\alpha,\beta$) and in-plane Zeeman field components ($h_x,h_y$). Our findings reveal that,
when the chemical potential ($\mu$) is high enough compared to the energy gap ($\Delta$) in superconducting
electrodes, i.e., $\mu \gg \Delta$, RSOI and DSOI with equal strengths ($|\alpha|=|\beta|$) cause
vanishing $\varphi_0$ state independent of magnetization and the type of RDSOI. A Zeeman field
with unequal components, i.e., $|h_x|\neq |h_y|$, however, can counteract and nullify the destructive
impact of equal-strength RDSOIs (for one type only), where $\mu\sim\Delta$, although $|h_x|=
|h_y|$ can still eliminate the $\varphi_0$ state. Remarkably, in the $\mu\sim\Delta$ limit, the
$\varphi_0$ state is proportional to the multiplication of both components of an in-plane Zeeman
field, i.e., $h_xh_y$, which is absent in the $\mu \gg \Delta$ limit. Furthermore, our results of
critical supercurrents demonstrate that the persistent spin helices can be revealed in a high enough
chemical potential regime $\mu\gg \Delta$, while an opposite regime, i.e., $\mu\sim\Delta$,
introduces an adverse effect. In the ballistic regime, the "maximum" of the critical supercurrent
occurs at $|\alpha|=|\beta|$ and the Zeeman field can boost this feature. The presence of disorder
and nonmagnetic impurities change this picture drastically so the "minimum" of the critical supercurrent
occurs at and around the symmetry lines $|\alpha|=|\beta|$.
