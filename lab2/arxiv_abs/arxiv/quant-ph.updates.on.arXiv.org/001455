We present a coherent and consistent framework for explicit time-dependence in non-Hermitian
quantum mechanics. The area of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics has been growing rapidly over the
past twenty years. This has been driven by the fact that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian
systems exhibit real energy eigenvalues and unitary time evolution. Historically, the introduction
of time into the world of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics has been a conceptually difficult problem
to address, as it requires the Hamiltonian to become unobservable. We solve this issue with the introduction
of a new observable energy operator and explain why its instigation is a necessary and natural progression
in this setting. For the first time, the introduction of time has allowed us to make sense of the parameter
regime in which the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is spontaneously broken. Ordinarily, in the time-independent
setting, the energy eigenvalues become complex and the wave functions are asymptotically unbounded.
We demonstrate that in the time-dependent setting this broken symmetry can be mended and analysis
on the spontaneously broken $\mathcal{PT}$ regime is indeed possible. We provide many examples
of this mending on a wide range of different systems, beginning with a $2\times2$ matrix model and
extending to higher dimensional matrix models and coupled harmonic oscillator systems with infinite
Hilbert space. Furthermore, we use the framework to perform analysis on time-dependent quasi-exactly
solvable models. We present the "eternal life" of entropy in this thesis. Ordinarily, for entangled
quantum systems coupled to the environments, the entropy decays rapidly to zero. However, in the
spontaneously broken regime, we find the entropy decays asymptotically to a non-zero value. We
create an elegant framework for Darboux and Darboux/Crum transformations for time-dependent
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
