Current development in programmable analogue quantum simulators (AQS), whose physical implementation
can be realised in the near-term compared to those of large-scale digital quantum computers, highlights
the need for robust testing techniques in analogue platforms. Methods to properly certify or benchmark
AQS should be efficiently scalable, and also provide a way to deal with errors from state preparation
and measurement (SPAM). Up to now, attempts to address this combination of requirements have generally
relied on model-specific properties. We put forward a new approach, applying a well-known digital
noise characterisation technique called randomized benchmarking (RB) to the analogue setting.
RB is a scalable experimental technique that provides a measure of the average error-rate of a gate-set
on a quantum hardware, incorporating SPAM errors. We present the original form of digital RB, the
necessary alterations to translate it to the analogue setting and introduce the analogue randomized
benchmarking protocol (ARB). In ARB we measure the average error-rate per time evolution of a family
of Hamiltonians and we illustrate this protocol with two case-studies of analogue models; classically
simulating the system by incorporating several physically motivated noise scenarios. We find
that for the noise models tested, the data fit with the theoretical predictions and we gain values
for the average error rate for differing unitary sets. We compare our protocol with other relevant
RB methods, where both advantages (physically motivated unitaries) and disadvantages (difficulty
in reversing the time-evolution) are discussed.
