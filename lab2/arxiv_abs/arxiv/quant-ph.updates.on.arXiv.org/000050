A quantum theory of scattering of radiation by a stationary free electron based on photon conception
and relativistic kinematics, applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation
of momentum was proposed by Compton to explain the scattering of X-rays and {\gamma}-rays by light
elements. The relativistic differential cross-section for the Compton scattering of a photon
by a stationary free electron was formulated by Klein and Nishina using Dirac's relativistic theory
of electrons, and has been verified experimentally, when the binding energy of the electron is negligible
compared to the incident photon energy. Here we show that the energy of scattered photons, and kinetic
energy of recoiled electrons obtained from Compton's quantum theory of scattering of radiation,
show a degree of matching (that increases with the increase of incident photon energy as quantified
by chi-square test) with the differential Klein-Nishina electronic cross section per electron
per unit solid angle for the scattering of an unpolarized photon by a stationary free electron when
appropriate normalizations are invoked. There is a high degree of matching in a regime where the
total electronic Klein-Nishina cross section for the Compton scattering on a free stationary electron
scales as the inverse of the incident photon energy and the contribution of the electro-magnetic
interaction to differential electronic cross section diminishes. Our results have significant
implications to the foundations of quantum mechanics and to the understanding of the mechanisms
of photon-electron interactions in the Compton scattering.
