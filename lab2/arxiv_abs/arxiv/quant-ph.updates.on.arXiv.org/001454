Silicon carbide is a very promising platform for quantum applications because of extraordinary
spin and optical properties of point defects in this technologically-friendly material. These
properties are strongly influenced by crystal vibrations, but the exact relationship between
them and the behavior of spin qubits is not fully investigated. We uncover the local vibrational
modes of the Si vacancy spin qubits in as-grown 4H-SiC. We apply the resonant microwave field to isolate
the contribution from one particular type of defects, the so-called V2 center, and observe the zero-phonon
line together with seven equally-separated phonon replicas. Furthermore, we present first-principles
calculations of the photoluminescence lineshape, which are in excellent agreement with our experimental
data. To boost up the calculation accuracy and decrease the computation time, we extract the force
constants using machine learning algorithms. This allows us to identify dominant modes in the lattice
vibrations coupled to an excited electron during optical emission in the Si vacancy. The resonance
phonon energy of 36 meV and the Debye-Waller factor of about 6% are obtained. We establish experimentally
that the activation energy of the optically-induced spin polarization is given by the local vibrational
energy. Our findings give insight into the coupling of electronic states to vibrational modes in
SiC spin qubits, which is essential to predict their spin, optical, mechanical and thermal properties.
The approach described can be applied to a large variety of spin defects with spectrally overlapped
contributions in SiC as well as in other 3D and 2D materials.
