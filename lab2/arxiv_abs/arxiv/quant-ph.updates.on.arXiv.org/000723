Analog quantum simulations---simulations of one Hamiltonian by another---is one of the major
goals in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computation (NISQ) era, and has many applications
in quantum complexity. We initiate the rigorous study of the physical resources required for such
simulations, where we focus on the task of Hamiltonian sparsification. The goal is to find a simulating
Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ whose underlying interaction graph has bounded degree (this is called
degree-reduction) or much fewer edges than that of the original Hamiltonian $H$ (this is called
dilution). We set this study in a relaxed framework for analog simulations that we call gap-simulation,
where $\tilde{H}$ is only required to simulate the groundstate(s) and spectral gap of $H$ instead
of its full spectrum, and we believe it is of independent interest. Our main result is a proof that
in stark contrast to the classical setting, general degree-reduction is impossible in the quantum
world, even under our relaxed notion of gap-simulation. The impossibility proof relies on devising
counterexample Hamiltonians and applying a strengthened variant of Hastings-Koma decay of correlations
theorem. We also show a complementary result where degree-reduction is possible when the strength
of interactions is allowed to grow polynomially. Furthermore, we prove the impossibility of the
related sparsification task of generic Hamiltonian dilution, under a computational hardness
assumption. We also clarify the (currently weak) implications of our results to the question of
quantum PCP. Our work provides basic answers to many of the "first questions" one would ask about
Hamiltonian sparsification and gap-simulation; we hope this serves a good starting point for future
research of these topics.
