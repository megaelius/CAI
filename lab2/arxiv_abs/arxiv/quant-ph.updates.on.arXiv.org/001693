We present an information geometric analysis of both entropic speeds and entropy production rates
arising from geodesic evolution on manifolds parametrized by pure quantum states. In particular,
we employ pure states that emerge as outputs of suitably chosen su(2; C) time-dependent Hamiltonian
operators that characterize analog quantum search algorithms of specific types. The su(2; C) Hamiltonian
models under consideration are specified by external time-dependent magnetic fields within which
spin-1/2 test particles are immersed. The positive definite Riemannian metrization of the parameter
manifold is furnished by the Fisher information function. The Fisher information function is evaluated
along parametrized squared probability amplitudes obtained from the temporal evolution of these
spin-1/2 test particles. A minimum action approach is then utilized to induce the transfer of the
quantum system from its initial state to its final state on the parameter manifold over a finite temporal
interval. We demonstrate in an explicit manner that the minimal (that is, optimum) path corresponds
to the shortest (that is, geodesic) path between the initial and final states. Furthermore, we show
that the minimal path serves also to minimize the total entropy production occurring during the
transfer of states. Finally, upon evaluating the entropic speed as well as the total entropy production
along optimal transfer paths within several scenarios of physical interest in analog quantum searching
algorithms, we demonstrate in a transparent quantitative manner a correspondence between a faster
transfer and a higher rate of entropy production. We therefore conclude that higher entropic speed
is associated with lower entropic efficiency within the context of quantum state transfer.
