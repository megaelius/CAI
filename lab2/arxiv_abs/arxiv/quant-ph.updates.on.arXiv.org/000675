The hard problem of consciousness is the question how subjective experience arises from brain matter.
I suggest exploring the possibility that quantum physics could be part of the answer. The simultaneous
unity and complexity of subjective experience is difficult to understand from a classical physics
perspective. In contrast, quantum entanglement is naturally both complex and unified. Moreover
the concept of matter is much more subtle in quantum physics compared to classical physics, and quantum
computing shows that quantum effects can be useful for information processing. Building on recent
progress in quantum technology and neuroscience, I propose a concrete hypothesis as a basis for
further investigation, namely that subjective experience is related to the dynamics of a complex
entangled state of spins, which is continuously generated and updated through the exchange of photons.
Spins in condensed matter systems at room or body temperature can have coherence times in the relevant
range for subjective experience (milliseconds to seconds). Photons are well suited for distributing
entanglement over macroscopic distances. Neurons emit photons, reactive oxygen species in the
mitochondria being likely sources. Opsins, light-sensitive proteins that are plausible single-photon
detectors, exist in the brain and are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that they serve a function.
We have recently shown by detailed numerical modeling that axons can plausibly act as photonic waveguides.
The oxygen molecule, which has non-zero electronic spin and emits photons, might serve as an interface
between photons and spins. The achievable photon rates seem to be more than sufficient to support
the bandwidth of subjective experience. The proposed hypothesis raises many interesting experimental
and theoretical questions in neuroscience, quantum physics, evolutionary biology, psychophysics,
and philosophy.
