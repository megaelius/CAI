The radiation-pressure interaction between one or more laser fields and a mechanical oscillator
gives rise to a wide range of phenomena: from sideband cooling and backaction-evading measurements
to pondermotive and mechanical squeezing to entanglement and motional sideband asymmetry. In
many protocols, such as dissipative mechanical squeezing, multiple lasers are utilized, giving
rise to periodically driven optomechanical systems. Here we show that in this case, Floquet dynamics
can arise due to presence of Kerr-type nonlinearities, which are ubiqitious in optomechanical
systems. Specifically, employing multiple probe tones, we perform sideband asymmetry measurements,
a macroscopic quantum effect, on a silicon optomechanical crystal sideband-cooled to 40% ground-state
occupation. We show that the Floquet dynamics, resulting from the presence of multiple pump tones,
gives rise to an artificially modified motional sideband asymmetry by redistributing thermal
and quantum fluctuations among the initially independently scattered thermomechanical sidebands.
For pump tones exhibiting large frequency separation, the dynamics is suppressed and accurate
quantum noise thermometry demonstrated. We develop a theoretical model based on Floquet theory
that accurately describes our observations. The resulting dynamics can be understood as resulting
from a synthetic gauge field among the Fourier modes, which is created by the phase lag of the Kerr-type
response. This novel phenomenon has wide-ranging implications for schemes utilizing several
pumping tones, as commonly employed in backaction-evading measurements, dissipative optical
squeezing, dissipative mechanical squeezing and quantum noise thermometry. Our observation
may equally well be used for optomechanical Floquet engineering, e.g. generation of topological
phases of sound by periodic time-modulation.
