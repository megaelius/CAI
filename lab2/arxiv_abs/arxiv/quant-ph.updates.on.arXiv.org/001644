Using the deterministic, on-demand generation of two entangled phonons, we demonstrate a quantum
eraser protocol in a phononic interferometer where the which-path information can be heralded
during the interference process. Omitting the heralding step yields a clear interference pattern
in the interfering half-quanta pathways; including the heralding step suppresses this pattern.
If we erase the heralded information after the interference has been measured, the interference
pattern is recovered, thereby implementing a delayed-choice quantum erasure. The test is implemented
using a closed surface-acoustic-wave communication channel into which one superconducting qubit
can emit itinerant phonons that the same or a second qubit can later re-capture. If the first qubit
releases only half of a phonon, the system follows a superposition of paths during the phonon propagation:
either an itinerant phonon is in the channel, or the first qubit remains in its excited state. These
two paths are made to constructively or destructively interfere by changing the relative phase
of the two intermediate states, resulting in a phase-dependent modulation of the first qubit's
final state, following interaction with the half-phonon. A heralding mechanism is added to this
construct, entangling a heralding phonon with the signalling phonon. The first qubit emits a phonon
herald conditioned on the qubit being in its excited state, with no signaling phonon, and the second
qubit catches this heralding phonon, storing which-path information which can either be read out,
destroying the signaling phonon's self-interference, or erased.
