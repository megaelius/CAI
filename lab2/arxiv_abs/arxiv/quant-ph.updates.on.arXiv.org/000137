The influence of thermal noise on bipartite and tripartite quantum steerings induced by a short
laser pulse in a hybrid three-mode optomechanical system is investigated. Explicit analytical
expressions are derived for the bipartite and tripartite steering parameters and the concept of
collective tripartite quantum steering is explored. Tripartite steering of a mode is said to be
the collective tripartite steering if it exists in the absence of all the bipartite steerings of
the mode. It is found that both bipartite and tripartite steering parameters are sensitive functions
of the initial state of the modes and distinctly different steering behaviour could be observed
depending on whether the modes were initially in a thermal state or not. The collective steering
can be achieved for the modes initially prepared in a thermal state. We find that the initial thermal
noise is more effective in destroying the bipartite rather than the tripartite steering which,
on the other hand, can persist even for a large thermal noise. For the initial vacuum state of a mode
which is steered by the remaining modes, the tripartite steering exists over the entire interaction
time even if the steering modes are in very noisy thermal states. There is no collective steering
possible for the cavity and atomic modes, but the mirror mode can be collectively steered by the other
modes although it is limited to long interaction time. When the steered mode is initially in a thermal
state, it can be collectively steered by the other modes. There are thresholds for the average number
of the thermal photons above which the existing tripartite steering appears as the collective steering.
Finally, we point out that the collective steering may provide a resource in a hybrid quantum network
for one-sided device-independent quantum secret sharing.
