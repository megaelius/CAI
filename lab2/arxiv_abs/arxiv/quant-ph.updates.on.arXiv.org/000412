Hybrid quantum-classical approaches, such as the variational quantum eigensolver, provide ways
to use near-term, pre-fault-tolerant quantum computers of intermediate size for practical applications.
Expanding the portfolio of such techniques, we propose a quantum circuit learning algorithm that
can be used to assist the characterization of quantum devices and to train shallow circuits for generative
tasks. The procedure leverages quantum hardware capabilities to its fullest extent by using native
gates and their qubit connectivity. We demonstrate that our approach can learn an optimal preparation
of the maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, also known as cat states. The
circuit layout needed to prepare cat states for any number of qubits is then obtained by analyzing
the resulting circuit patterns for odd and even number of qubits. We further demonstrate our hybrid
approach can efficiently prepare approximate representations of coherent thermal states, wave
functions that encode Boltzmann probabilities in their amplitudes. Finally, complementing proposals
to characterize the power or usefulness of near-term quantum devices, such as IBM's quantum volume,
we provide a new hardware-independent metric called the qBAS score. It is based on the performance
yield in a specific sampling task on one of the canonical machine learning data sets known as Bars
and Stripes. We show how entanglement is a key ingredient in encoding the patterns of this data set
into the quantum distribution resulting from the shallow quantum circuit; an ideal benchmark for
testing hardware proposal starting at four qubits and up. We provide experimental results and evaluation
of this metric to probe the trade off between several architectural circuit designs and circuit
depths on an ion-trap quantum computer.
