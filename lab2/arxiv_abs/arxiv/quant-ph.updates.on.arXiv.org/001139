When thermodynamics is understood as the science (or art) of constructing effective models of natural
phenomena by choosing a minimal level of description capable of capturing the essential features
of the physical reality of interest, the scientific community has identified a set of general rules
that the model must incorporate if it aspires to be consistent with the body of known experimental
evidence. Some of these rules are believed to be so general that we think of them as laws of Nature,
such as the great conservation principles, whose "greatness" derives from their generality, as
masterfully explained by Feynman in one of his legendary lectures. The second law of thermodynamics
is universally contemplated among the great laws of Nature. In this paper we show that, in the past
four decades, an enormous body of scientific research devoted to modeling the essential features
of nonequilibrium natural phenomena has converged from many different directions and frameworks
towards the general recognition (albeit still expressed in different but equivalent forms and
language) that another rule is also indispensable and reveals another great law of Nature that we
propose to call the \caporali{fourth law of thermodynamics}. We state it as follows: every nonequilibrium
state of a system or local subsystem must be equipped with a metric in state space with respect to which
the irreversible component of its time evolution is in the direction of steepest entropy ascent
compatible with the conservation constraints. To illustrate the power of the fourth law, we derive
extensions of Onsager reciprocity and fluctuation-dissipation relations to the far-nonequilibrium
realm within the framework of the rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) approximation
(also known as the quasi-equilibrium approximation).
