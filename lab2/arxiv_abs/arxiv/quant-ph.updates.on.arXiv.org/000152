The one-dimensional (1D) Fermi gas with repulsive short-range interactions provides an important
model of strong correlations and is often amenable to exact methods. However, in the presence of
confinement, no exact solution is known for an arbitrary number of strongly interacting fermions.
Here, we propose a novel ansatz for generating the lowest-energy wavefunctions of the repulsive
1D Fermi gas in a harmonic potential near the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) limit of infinite interactions.
We specialize to the case of a single impurity interacting with $N$ majority particles, where we
may derive analytic forms of the approximate wavefunctions. Comparing with exact numerics, we
show that the overlap between the wavefunctions from our ansatz and the exact ones in the ground-state
manifold exceeds 0.9997 for $N\leq8$. Moreover, the overlap for the ground-state wavefunction
extrapolates to 0.9999 as $N\to\infty$. Thus our ansatz is essentially indistinguishable from
numerically exact results in both the few- and many-body limits. In the large $N$ limit, we find that
the impurity probability density in the ground state is only slightly perturbed by the infinitely
repulsive interactions, while the quasiparticle residue vanishes as the many-body limit is approached,
reflecting the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe. We derive an effective Heisenberg spin-chain
model for the regime near the TG limit, within which our ansatz is exact. Here, we find that the impurity
eigenstates in the spin basis correspond to discrete Chebyshev polynomials. The energy of states
in excited manifolds is calculated using a dynamical SO(2,1) symmetry, which provides an exact
relation between states related by a scaling transformation. We finally show how our results for
the wavefunctions and the energy spectrum can be detected in cold atomic gases via collective-mode,
tunneling, and radio-frequency experiments.
