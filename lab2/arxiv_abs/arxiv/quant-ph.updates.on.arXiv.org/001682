Usually, when investigating exceptional points (EPs) of an open Markovian bosonic system, one
deals with spectral degeneracies of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), which can correctly describe
the system dynamics only in the semiclassical regime. A recently proposed quantum Liouvillian
framework enables to completely determine the dynamical properties of such systems and their EPs
(referred to as Liouvillian EPs, or LEPs) in the quantum regime by taking into account the effects
of quantum jumps, which are ignored in the NHH formalism. Moreover, the symmetry and eigenfrequency
spectrum of the NHH become a part of much larger Liouvillian eigenspace. As such, the EPs of an NHH
form a subspace of the LEPs. Here we show that once an NHH of a dissipative linear bosonic system exhibits
an EP of a certain finite order $n$, it immediately implies that the corresponding LEP can become
of any higher order $m\geq n$, defined in the infinite Hilbert space. Most importantly, these higher-order
LEPs can be identified by the coherence and spectral functions at the steady state. The coherence
functions can offer a convenient tool to probe extreme system sensitivity to external perturbations
in the vicinity of higher-order LEPs. As an example, we study a linear bosonic system of a bimodal
cavity with incoherent mode coupling to reveal its higher-order LEPs; particularly, of second
and third order via first- and second-order coherence functions, respectively. Accordingly,
these LEPs can be additionally revealed by squared and cubic Lorentzian spectral lineshapes in
the power and intensity-fluctuation spectra. Moreover, we demonstrate that these EPs can also
be associated with spontaneous parity-time (${\cal PT}$) and anti-${\cal PT}$-symmetry breaking
in the system studied.
