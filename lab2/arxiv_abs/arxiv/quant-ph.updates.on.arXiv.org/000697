Quantum phase estimation is the workhorse behind any quantum algorithm and a promising method for
determining ground state energies of strongly correlated quantum systems. Low-cost quantum phase
estimation techniques make use of circuits which only use a single ancilla qubit, requiring classical
post-processing to extract eigenvalue details of the system. We investigate choices for phase
estimation for a unitary matrix with low-depth noise-free or noisy circuits, varying both the phase
estimation circuits themselves as well as the classical post-processing to determine the eigenvalue
phases. We work in the scenario when the input state is not an eigenstate of the unitary matrix. We
develop a new post-processing technique to extract eigenvalues from phase estimation data based
on classical time-series analysis, and contrast this to an analysis via Bayesian methods. We calculate
the variance in estimating single eigenvalues via the time-series analysis analytically, finding
that it scales to first order in the number of experiments performed, and to first or second order
(depending on the experiment design) in the circuit depth. Numerical simulations confirm this
scaling for both estimators. We observe numerically that these post-processing techniques lead
to a variance in estimating the lowest eigenvalue phase which scales to first order in the overlap
between the starting and ground states, to second order in the gap between the ground and excited
states, and to second order in the decoherence time of the system. We attempt to compensate for noise
in both classical post-processing techniques, finding good results in the presence of depolarizing
noise, but smaller improvements in realistic circuit-level simulations.
