We study quantum kicked rotator in the classically fully chaotic regime, in the domain of the semiclassical
behaviour. We use Izrailev's N-dimensional model for various N<=4000, which in the limit N->
infinity tends to the quantized kicked rotator, not only for K=5 as studied previously, but for many
different values of the classical kick parameter 5<=K<=35, and also of the quantum parameter
k. We describe the dynamical localization of chaotic eigenstates as a paradigm for other both time-periodic
and time-independent fully chaotic or/and mixed type Hamilton systems. We generalize the localization
length L and the scaling variable (L/N) to the case of anomalous classical diffusion. We study the
generalized classical diffusion also in the regime where the simple minded theory of the normal
diffusion fails. We greatly improve the accuracy of the numerical calculations with the following
conclusions: The level spacings distribution of the eigenphases is very well described by the Brody
distribution, systematically better than by other proposals, for various Brody exponents. When
N->infinity and L is fixed we have always Poisson, even in fully chaotic regime. We study the eigenfunctions
of the Floquet operator and characterize their localization properties using the information
entropy measure describing the degree of dynamical localization of the eigenfunction. The resulting
localization parameter is found to be almost equal to the Brody parameter. We show the existence
of a scaling law between the localization parameter and the scaling variable L/N, now including
the regimes of anomalous diffusion. The above findings are important also in time-independent
Hamilton systems, like in mixed type billiards, where the Brody distribution is confirmed to a very
high degree of precision for dynamically localized chaotic eigenstates.
