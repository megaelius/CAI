Quantum non-locality tests have been of interest since the original EPR paper. The present paper
discusses whether the CGLMP (Bell) inequalities obtained by Collins et al are possible tests for
showing that quantum theory is not underpinned by hidden variable theory (HVT). It is contended
that CGLMP inequalities only require that HVT applies without requiring it to be local, so hidden
variable theories of a more general class could also be ruled out. Restricting the HVT to be local
does not result in a weaker CGLMP inequality. The HVT involved is based on a probability for outcomes
of simultaneous measurements of pairs of observables corresponding to non-commuting quantum
operators, which is allowed in classical theory. Although the CGLMP inequalities involve probabilities
for measurements that are compatible with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and for which both
HVT and quantum expressions exist, there is no unambiguous quantum measurement process linked
to the probabilities in the CGLMP inequalities. Quantum measurements corresponding to the different
classical measurements that give the same CGLMP probability are found to yield different CGLMP
probabilities . However, violation of a CGLMP inequality based on any one of the possible quantum
measurement sequences is sufficient to show that the Collins et al HVT does not predict the same results
as quantum theory, such as for a state considered in their paper (though for observables lacking
a physical interpretation). In spite of the problems of comparing the HVT inequalities with quantum
expressions, it is concluded that the CGLMP inequalities are suitable for ruling out even non-local
hidden variable theories - a significance not previously recognised.
