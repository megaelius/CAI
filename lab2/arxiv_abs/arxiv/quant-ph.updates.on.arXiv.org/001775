We study the properties of the transition probability and entanglement harvesting phenomenon
for circularly accelerated detectors locally interacting with massless scalar fields. The dependence
of the transition probability on the parameters associated with the circular motion is first analyzed
in detail. By a cross-comparison with the situation of the uniformly accelerated motion, we obtain
that the transition probability and the possible thermalization behavior for detectors rotating
with an extremely large circular radius are analogous to that for uniformly accelerated detectors,
but for a very small linear speed and a large acceleration, the effective temperature which characterizes
the detectors' thermalization in a finite duration is much lower than that for uniformly accelerated
detectors. We then focus on the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting in two special situations
of circular trajectories, i.e., the coaxial rotation and the mutually perpendicular axial rotation
by examining the concurrence as the entanglement measure in detail. We find that when two circularly
accelerated detectors have equivalent acceleration and size of circular trajectory, the harvested
entanglement rapidly decays with increasing acceleration or separation between two detectors.
In contrast with the situation of uniform acceleration, the angular velocity would have significant
impacts on entanglement harvesting. Especially for those detectors circularly moving in different
directions, both the acceleration and trajectory radius play an important inhibiting role in entanglement
harvesting. When two circularly accelerated detectors have different values of acceleration
or angular velocity, we find that the entanglement can still be extracted by such detectors, even
in the situation that one detector is at rest and the other is in a circular motion.
