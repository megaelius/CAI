Just as classical information technology rests on a foundation built of interconnected information-processing
systems, quantum information technology (QIT) must do the same. A critical component of such systems
is the interconnect, a device or process that allows transfer of information between disparate
physical media, for example, semiconductor electronics, light pulses in optical fiber, or microwave
fields. While interconnects have been well engineered for decades in the realm of classical information
technology, quantum interconnects (QuICs) present special challenges, as they must allow the
transfer of fragile quantum states between different physical parts or degrees of freedom of the
system. The diversity of QIT platforms (superconducting, atomic, solid-state color center, optical,
etc.) that will form a quantum Internet poses additional challenges. While QuICs are essential
for realization of a wide range of QIT, including distributed and modular quantum computation and
secure communication, they have received significantly less attention from the funding agencies
and, as a result, from the research community than the systems they are connecting. However, as quantum
systems scale to larger size, the quantum interconnect bottleneck is imminent, and is emerging
as a grand challenge for QIT. For these reasons, it is the position of the community represented by
participants of the NSF workshop on Quantum Interconnects that accelerating QuIC research is crucial
for sustained development of a national quantum science and technology program. Given the diversity
of QIT platforms, materials used, applications, and infrastructure required, a convergent research
and partnership between academia, industry and national laboratories is required.
