The transfer of quantum information through a noisy environment is a central challenge in the fields
of quantum communication, imaging, and nanophotonics, and plays an important role in the study
of quantum phenomena in biological systems. In particular, high-dimensional quantum states of
light enable quantum networks with significantly higher information capacities and noise-robustness
as compared with qubits. High-dimensional entanglement can tolerate large amounts of loss in loophole-free
tests of nonlocality, holding immense potential for the realisation of device-independent quantum
communication. However, while qubit-entanglement has been distributed over large distances
through free-space and fibre, the transport of high-dimensional entanglement is hindered by the
complexity of the channel, which encompasses effects such as free-space turbulence or mode-mixing
in multi-mode waveguides. As a result, the transport of entangled states of light through highly
complex media has never been achieved. Here we demonstrate the transport of six-dimensional spatial-mode
entanglement through a two-metre long, commercial multi-mode fibre with 84.43% fidelity. We show
how the entanglement can itself be used to measure the transmission matrix of the complex medium,
allowing the recovery of quantum correlations that were initially lost. Using a unique property
of entangled states, the medium is rendered transparent to entanglement by carefully "scrambling"
the photon that did not enter it, rather than unscrambling the photon that did. Our work overcomes
a primary challenge in the fields of quantum communication and imaging, and opens a new pathway towards
the control of complex scattering processes in the quantum regime.
