We examine the usefulness of applying neural networks as a variational state ansatz for many-body
quantum systems in the context of quantum information-processing tasks. In the neural network
state ansatz, the complex amplitude function of a quantum state is computed by a neural network.
The resulting multipartite entanglement structure captured by this ansatz has proven rich enough
to describe the ground states and unitary dynamics of various physical systems of interest. In the
present paper, we initiate the study of neural network states in quantum information-processing
tasks. We demonstrate that neural network states are capable of efficiently representing quantum
codes for quantum information transmission and quantum error correction, supplying further evidence
for the usefulness of neural network states to describe multipartite entanglement. In particular,
we show the following main results: a) Neural network states yield quantum codes with a high coherent
information for two important quantum channels, the generalized amplitude damping channel and
the dephrasure channel. These codes outperform all other known codes for these channels, and cannot
be found using a direct parametrization of the quantum state. b) For the depolarizing channel, the
neural network state ansatz reliably finds the best known codes given by repetition codes. c) Neural
network states can be used to represent absolutely maximally entangled states, a special type of
quantum error-correcting codes. In all three cases, the neural network state ansatz provides an
efficient and versatile means as a variational parametrization of these highly entangled states.
