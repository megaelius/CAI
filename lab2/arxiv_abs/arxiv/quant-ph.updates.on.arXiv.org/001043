Nuclear spins are highly coherent quantum objects. In large ensembles, their control and detection
via magnetic resonance is widely exploited, e.g. in chemistry, medicine, materials science and
mining. Nuclear spins also featured in early ideas and demonstrations of quantum information processing.
Scaling up these ideas requires controlling individual nuclei, which can be detected when coupled
to an electron. However, the need to address the nuclei via oscillating magnetic fields complicates
their integration in multi-spin nanoscale devices, because the field cannot be localized or screened.
Control via electric fields would resolve this problem, but previous methods relied upon transducing
electric signals into magnetic fields via the electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction, which
severely affects the nuclear coherence. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum control of a single
antimony (spin-7/2) nucleus, using localized electric fields produced within a silicon nanoelectronic
device. The method exploits an idea first proposed in 1961 but never realized experimentally with
a single nucleus. Our results are quantitatively supported by a microscopic theoretical model
that reveals how the purely electrical modulation of the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction,
in the presence of lattice strain, results in coherent nuclear spin transitions. The spin dephasing
time, 0.1 seconds, surpasses by orders of magnitude those obtained via methods that require a coupled
electron spin for electrical drive. These results show that high-spin quadrupolar nuclei could
be deployed as chaotic models, strain sensors and hybrid spin-mechanical quantum systems using
all-electrical controls. Integrating electrically controllable nuclei with quantum dots could
pave the way to scalable nuclear- and electron-spin-based quantum computers in silicon that operate
without the need for oscillating magnetic fields.
