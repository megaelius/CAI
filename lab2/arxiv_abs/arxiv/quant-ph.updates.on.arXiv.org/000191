We investigate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation (EPR), the quadrature squeezing and
the continuous variable quantum teleportation when considering non-Gaussian entangled states
generated by applying multiple-photon addition and multiple-photon subtraction to a two-mode
squeezed vacuum state (TMSVs). Our results indicate that, in the case of symmetric multiple-photon-subtracted
TMSVs, the corresponding EPR correlation, the two-mode squeezing, the sum squeezing and the fidelity
of teleporting a coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state can be enhanced for any squeezing parameter
$r$, and these enhancements increase with the number of the operations in small-squeezing regime.
While asymmetric multiple-photon subtractions will generally reduce these quantities. For the
multiple-photon added TMSVs, although it holds stronger entanglement, its EPR correlation, two-mode
squeezing, sum squeezing and the fidelity of a coherent state are always smaller than that of the
TMSVs. Only when considering teleporting a squeezed vacuum state, the symmetric photon addition
makes somewhat improvement of the fidelity in large squeezing parameters. Furthermore, the optimal
entanglement, the optimal EPR correlation, the optimal quadrature squeezing and the optimal fidelity,
the four quantities always prefer to symmetrical arrangements of photon addition or subtraction
on the two modes. Finally, we analytically prove that one-mode multiple-photon subtracted TMSVs
is equivalent to that of the one-mode multiple-photon added one, and one-mode multiple-photon
operations do not enhance the above four quantities at all, and even diminish them.
