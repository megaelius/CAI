Superposition of optical coherent states $\left|\pm\alpha\right\rangle$, possessing opposite
phases, play an important role as qubits in quantum information processing (QIP) tasks and are of
fundamental importance in testing quantum mechanics. Passage of such superposition of coherent
states (SCS) from a 50:50 beam splitter lead to generation of entangled coherent states. Recently,
ququats and qutrits defined in four and three dimensional Hilbert space respectively, have attracted
much attention as they offer advantage in secure quantum communication. However, practical utilization
of these advantages essentially require physical realization of quantum optical ququats and qutrits.
Here, we define four new multi-photonic states (MPS) with $4n +j$ (here, $j =0, 1, 2$ or $3$, and $n
= 0, 1, ..., \infty$) numbers of photon and show how the SCS can be used to encode ququat using these
MPS as basis vectors of a four dimensional Hilbert space. When these MPS fall upon a 50:50 beam splitter,
the resulting states are bipartite four-component entangled coherent states (BFECS) equivalently
representing the entangled ququats. We briefly discuss the photon statistical properties of such
MPS and BFECS. We show that these MPS and BFECS can be synthesized using even coherent states as input
to an interferometer. We give a simple linear optical protocol for almost perfect teleportation
of a ququat encoded in SCS with the aid of BFECS as quantum channel. We also describe how these ququats
can be used for realization of higher dimensional BB84 protocol in order to increase the security
of quantum key distribution. Finally, we discuss the possible advantages of using SCS as ququats
and BFECS as quantum channel in different QIP tasks.
