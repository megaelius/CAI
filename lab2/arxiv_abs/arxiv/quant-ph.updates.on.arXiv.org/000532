A Bell test, which challenges the philosophical worldview of local realism against experimental
observations, is a randomized trial requiring spatially-distributed entanglement, fast and
high-efficiency detection, and unpredictable measurement settings. While technology can perfect
the first two of these, and while technological randomness sources enable device-independent
protocols based on Bell inequality violation, challenging local realism using physical randomizers
inevitably makes assumptions about the same physics one aims to test. Bell himself noted this weakness
of physical setting choices and argued that human free will could rigorously be used to assure unpredictability
in Bell tests. Here we report a suite of local realism tests using human choices, avoiding assumptions
about predictability in physics. We recruited ~100,000 human participants to play an online video
game that incentivizes fast, sustained input of unpredictable bits while also illustrating Bell
test methodology. The participants generated 97,347,490 binary choices, which were directed
via a scalable web platform to twelve laboratories on five continents, in which 13 experiments tested
local realism using photons, single atoms, atomic ensembles, and superconducting devices. Over
a 12-hour period on the 30 Nov. 2016, participants worldwide provided a sustained flow of over 1000
bits/s to the experiments, which used different human-generated bits to choose each measurement
setting. The observed correlations strongly contradict local realism and other realist positions
in bi-partite and tri-partite scenarios. Project outcomes include closing of the freedom-of-choice
loophole, gamification of statistical and quantum non-locality concepts, new methods for quantum-secured
communications, a very large dataset of human-generated randomness, and networking techniques
for global participation in experimental science.
