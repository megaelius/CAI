The asymptotic restriction problem for tensors is to decide, given tensors $s$ and $t$, whether
the nth tensor power of $s$ can be obtained from the $(n+o(n))$th tensor power of t by applying linear
maps to the tensor legs (this we call restriction), when $n$ goes to infinity. In this context, Volker
Strassen, striving to understand the complexity of matrix multiplication, introduced in 1986
the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. Essentially, the asymptotic restriction problem for a family
of tensors $X$, closed under direct sum and tensor product, reduces to finding all maps from $X$ to
the reals that are monotone under restriction, normalised on diagonal tensors, additive under
direct sum and multiplicative under tensor product, which Strassen named spectral points. Strassen
created the support functionals, which are spectral points for oblique tensors, a strict subfamily
of all tensors. Universal spectral points are spectral points for the family of all tensors. The
construction of nontrivial universal spectral points has been an open problem for more than thirty
years. We construct for the first time a family of nontrivial universal spectral points over the
complex numbers, using quantum entropy and covariants: the quantum functionals. In the process
we connect the asymptotic spectrum to the quantum marginal problem and to the entanglement polytope.
To demonstrate the asymptotic spectrum, we reprove (in hindsight) recent results on the cap set
problem by reducing this problem to computing asymptotic spectrum of the reduced polynomial multiplication
tensor, a prime example of Strassen. A better understanding of our universal spectral points construction
may lead to further progress on related questions. We additionally show that the quantum functionals
characterise asymptotic slice rank for complex tensors.
