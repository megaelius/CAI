Single-photon sources are at the heart of quantum-optical networks, with their uniquely quantum
emission and phenomenon of two-photon interference allowing for the generation and transfer of
nonclassical states. Although a few analytical methods have been briefly investigated for describing
pulsed single-photon sources, these methods apply only to either perfectly ideal or at least extremely
idealized sources. Here, we present the first complete picture of pulsed single-photon sources
by elaborating how to numerically and fully characterize non-ideal single-photon sources operating
in a pulsed regime. In order to achieve this result, we make the connection between quantum Monte--Carlo
simulations, experimental characterizations, and an extended form of the quantum regression
theorem. We elaborate on how an ideal pulsed single-photon source is connected to its photocount
distribution and its measured degree of second- and first-order optical coherence. By doing so,
we provide a description of the relationship between instantaneous source correlations and the
typical experimental interferometers (Hanbury-Brown and Twiss, Hong-Ou-Mandel, and Mach-Zehnder)
used to characterize such sources. Then, we use these techniques to explore several prototypical
quantum systems and their non-ideal behaviors. As an example numerical result, we show that for
the most popular single-photon source---a resonantly excited two-level system---its error probability
is directly related to its excitation pulse length. We believe that the intuition gained from these
representative systems and characters can be used to interpret future results with more complicated
source Hamiltonians and behaviors. Finally, we have thoroughly documented our simulation methods
with contributions to the Quantum Optics Toolbox in Python (QuTiP) in order to make our work easily
accessible to other scientists and engineers.
