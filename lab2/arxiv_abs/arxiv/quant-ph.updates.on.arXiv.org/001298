Physical observation is made relative to a reference frame. A reference frame is essentially a quantum
system given the universal validity of quantum mechanics. Thus, a quantum system must be described
relative to a quantum reference frame (QRF) using relational observables. To address this requirement,
two approaches are proposed in the literature. The first one is an operational approach (F. Giacomini,
et al, Nat. Comm. 10:494, 2019) which focuses on the quantization of transformation between QRFs.
The second approach attempts to derive the quantum transformation between QRFs from first principles
(A. Vanrietvelde, et al, arXiv:1809.00556). Such first principle approach describes physical
systems as symmetry induced constrained Hamiltonian systems. The Dirac quantization of such systems
before removing redundancy is interpreted as perspective-neutral description. Then, a systematic
redundancy reduction procedure is introduced to derive description from perspective of a QRF.
The first principle approach recovers some of the results from the operational approach, but not
yet include an important part of a quantum theory - the measurement theory. This paper is intended
to bridge the gap. We show that the von Neumann quantum measurement theory can be embedded into the
perspective-neutral framework. This allows us to successfully recover the results found in the
operational approach, with the advantage that the transformation operator can be derived from
the first principle. In addition, the formulation presented here reveals several interesting
conceptual insights. For instance, the projection operation in measurement needs to be performed
after redundancy reduction, and the projection operator must be transformed accordingly when
switching QRFs. These results extend our understanding on how quantum systems should be described
when the reference frame is also a quantum system.
