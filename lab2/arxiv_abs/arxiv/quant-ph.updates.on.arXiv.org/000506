Following the first paper on quantum algorithms for SDP-solving by Brand\~ao and Svore in 2016,
rapid developments has been made on quantum optimization algorithms. Recently Brand\~ao et al.
improved the quantum SDP-solver in the so-called quantum state input model, where the input matrices
of the SDP are given as purified mixed states. They also gave the first non-trivial application of
quantum SDP-solving by obtaining a more efficient algorithm for the problem of shadow tomography
(proposed by Aaronson in 2017). In this paper we improve on all previous quantum SDP-solvers. Mainly
we construct better Gibbs-samplers for both input models, which directly gives better bounds for
SDP-solving. For an SDP with $m$ constraints involving $n\times n$ matrices, our improvements
yield an $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left( \left( \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n}\gamma \right)s \gamma^4\right)$
upper bound on SDP-solving in the sparse matrix input model and an $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left(
\left(\sqrt{m}+B^{2.5}\gamma^{3.5} \right)B\gamma^4 \right)$ upper bound in the quantum state
input model. We then apply these results to the problem of shadow tomography to simultaneously improve
the best known upper bounds on sample complexity due to Aaronson and complexity due Brandao et al.
Furthermore, we apply our quantum SDP-solvers to the problems of quantum state discrimination
and E-optimal design. In both cases we beat the classical lower bound in terms of some parameters,
at the expense of heavy dependence on some other parameters. Finally we prove two lowers bounds for
solving SDPs using quantum algorithms: (1) $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{m}B/\eps)$ in the quantum
state input model, and (2) $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{m}\alpha/\eps)$ in the quantum operator input
model. These lower bounds show that the $\sqrt{m}$ factor and the polynomial dependence on the parameters
$B,\alpha$, and $1/\eps$ are necessary.
