We study the preparation of coherent quantum states in a two-photon micromaser for applications
in quantum metrology. While this setting can be in principle realized in a host of physical systems,
we consider atoms interacting with the field of a cavity. We focus on the case of the interaction described
by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, which cannot be achieved by the conventional approach with
three-level atoms coupled to the cavity field at two-photon resonance. We find that additional
levels are required in order to cancel Stark shifts emerging in the leading order. Once this is accomplished,
the dynamics of the cavity features a degenerate stationary state manifold of pure states. We derive
the analytic form of these states and show that they include Schr\"odinger cat states with a tunable
mean photon number. We also confirm these states can be useful in phase estimation protocols with
their quantum Fisher information exceeding the standard limit. To account for realistic imperfections,
we consider single-photon losses from the cavity, finite lifetime of atom levels, and higher order
corrections in the far-detuned limit, which result in metastability of formerly stationary cavity
states and long-time dynamics with a unique mixed stationary state. Despite being mixed, this stationary
state can still feature quantum Fisher information above the standard limit. Our work delivers
a comprehensive overview of the two-photon micromaser dynamics with particular focus on application
in phase estimation and, while we consider the setup with atoms coupled to a cavity, the results can
be directly translated to optomechanical systems.
