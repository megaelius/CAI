The extreme-value statistics of the entanglement spectrum in disordered spin chains possessing
a many-body localization transition is examined. It is expected that eigenstates in the metallic
or ergodic phase, behave as random states and hence the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix,
commonly referred to as the entanglement spectrum, are expected to follow the eigenvalue statistics
of a trace normalized Wishart ensemble. In particular, the density of eigenvalues is supposed to
follow the universal Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We find deviations in the tails both for the
disordered XXZ with total $S_z$ conserved in the half-filled sector as well as in a model that breaks
this conservation. A sensitive measure of deviations is provided by the largest eigenvalue, which
in the case of the Wishart ensemble after appropriate shift and scaling follows the universal Tracy-Widom
distribution. We show that for the models considered, in the metallic phase, the largest eigenvalue
of the reduced density matrix of eigenvector, instead follows the generalized extreme-value statistics
bordering on the Fisher-Tipett-Gumbel distribution indicating that the correlations between
eigenvalues are much weaker compared to the Wishart ensemble. We show by means of distributions
conditional on the high entropy and normalized participation ratio of eigenstates that the conditional
entanglement spectrum still follows generalized extreme value distribution. In the deeply localized
phase we find heavy tailed distributions and L\'evy stable laws in an appropriately scaled function
of the largest and second largest eigenvalues. The scaling is motivated by a recently developed
perturbation theory of weakly coupled chaotic systems.
