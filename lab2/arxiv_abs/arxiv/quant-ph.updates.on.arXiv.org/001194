The Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory of electrons in the presence of a static electromagnetic field
can be described from the perspective of the individual electron via its equation of motion or `Quantal
Newtonian' first law. The law is in terms of `classical' fields whose sources are quantum-mechanical
expectation values of Hermitian operators taken with respect to the wave function. The law states
that the sum of the external and internal fields experienced by each electron vanishes. The external
field is the sum of the binding electrostatic and Lorentz fields. The internal field is the sum of
fields representative of properties of the system: electron correlations due to the Pauli exclusion
principle and Coulomb repulsion; the electron density; kinetic effects; the current density.
Thus, the internal field is a sum of the electron-interaction, differential density, kinetic,
and internal magnetic fields. The energy can be expressed in integral virial form in terms of these
fields. Via this perspective, the Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation can be written in a generalized
form which then shows it to be intrinsically self-consistent. This new perspective is explicated
by application to the triplet $2^{3}S$ state of a 2-D 2-electron quantum dot in a magnetic field.
The quantal sources of the density; the paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and magnetization current
densities; pair-correlation density; the Fermi-Coulomb hole charge; and the single-particle
density matrix are obtained, and from them the corresponding fields determined. The fields are
shown to satisfy the `Quantal Newtonian' first law. The components of the energy too are determined
from these fields. Finally, the example is employed to demonstrate the intrinsic self-consistent
nature of the Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation.
