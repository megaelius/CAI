The optimal discrimination of coherent states of light with current technology is a key problem
in classical and quantum communication, whose solution would enable the realization of efficient
receivers for long-distance communications in free-space and optical fiber channels. In this
article, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) protocols allow an agent to learn near-optimal
coherent-state receivers made of passive linear optics, photodetectors and classical adaptive
control. Each agent is trained and tested in real time over several runs of independent discrimination
experiments and has no knowledge about the energy of the states nor the receiver setup nor the quantum-mechanical
laws governing the experiments. Based exclusively on the observed photodetector outcomes, the
agent adaptively chooses among a set of ~3 10^3 possible receiver setups, and obtains a reward at
the end of each experiment if its guess is correct. At variance with previous applications of RL in
quantum physics, the information gathered in each run is intrinsically stochastic and thus insufficient
to evaluate exactly the performance of the chosen receiver. Nevertheless, we present families
of agents that: (i) discover a receiver beating the best Gaussian receiver after ~3 10^2 experiments;
(ii) surpass the cumulative reward of the best Gaussian receiver after ~10^3 experiments; (iii)
simultaneously discover a near-optimal receiver and attain its cumulative reward after ~10^5
experiments. Our results show that RL techniques are suitable for on-line control of quantum receivers
and can be employed for long-distance communications over potentially unknown channels.
