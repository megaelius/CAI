Narrow-band intensity-difference squeezing beams have important applications in quantum metrology
and gravitational wave detection. The best way to generate narrow-band intensity-difference
squeezing is to employ parametrically-amplified four-wave mixing process in high-gain atomic
media. Such IDS can be further enhanced by cascading multiple parametrically-amplified four-wave
mixing processes in separate atomic media. The complicated experimental setup, added losses and
required high-power pump laser with the increase of number of stages can limit the wide uses of such
scheme in practical applications. Here, we show that by modulating the internal energy level(s)
with additional laser(s), the degree of original intensity-difference squeezing can be substantially
increased. With an initial intensity-difference squeezing of $-8.5\pm0.4$ dB using parametrically-amplified-non-degenerate
four-wave mixing process in a three-level $\Lambda$-type configuration, the degree of intensity-difference
squeezing can be enhanced to $-11.9\pm0.4$ dB/$-13.9\pm0.4$ dB (corrected for losses) when we
use one/two laser beam(s) to modulate the involved ground/excited state(s). More importantly,
a maximal noise reduction of $-9.7\pm0.4$ dB (only corrected for electronic noise) is observed
below the standard quantum limit, which is the strongest reported to date in phase insensitive amplification
in four-wave mixing. Applying the model to quantum metrology, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved
by 23 dB compared to the conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the same phase-sensing
intensity, which is a 14-fold enhancement in rms phase measurement sensitivity beyond the shot
noise limit. Our results show a low-loss, robust and efficient way to produce high degree of IDS and
facilitate its potential applications.
