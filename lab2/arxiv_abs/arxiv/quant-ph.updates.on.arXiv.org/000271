Thermodynamics was developed in the XIXth century to provide a physical description to engines
and other macroscopic thermal machines. Since then, progress in nanotechnologies urged to extend
these formalism, initially designed for classical systems, to the quantum world. During this thesis,
I have built a formalism to study the stochastic thermodynamics of quantum systems, in which quantum
measurement plays a central role : like the thermal reservoir of standard stochastic thermodynamics,
it is the primary source of randomness in the system's dynamics. I first studied projective measurement
as a thermodynamic process. I evidenced that measurement is responsible for an uncontroled variation
of the system's energy that I called quantum heat, and also a production of entropy. As a proof of concept,
I studied an engine extracting work from the measurementinduced quantum fluctuations. Then, I
extended this formalism to generalized measurements, which allowed to describe open quantum systems
(i.e. in contact with reservoirs). I defined work, heat and entropy production for single realizations
of thermodynamic protocols, and retrieved that these quantities obey fluctuation theorems. I
applied this formalism to the canonical situation of quantum optics, i.e. a Qubit coupled to a laser
and a the vacuum. Finally, I studied a promising platform to test Qubit's thermodynamics: a hybrid
optomechanical system. The formalism developed in this thesis is of interest for the quantum thermodynamics
community as it enables to characterize quantum heat engines and compare their performances to
their classical analogs. Furthermore, as it sets quantum measurement as a thermodynamic process,
it pave the ways to a new kind of thermodynamic machines, exploiting the specificities of quantum
realm in an unprecedented way.
