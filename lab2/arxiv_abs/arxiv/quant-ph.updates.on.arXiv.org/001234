We propose a scheme that generalizes the loss scaling properties of twin-field or phase-matching
QKD related to a channel of transmission $\eta_{total}$ from $\sqrt{\eta_{total}}$ to $\sqrt[2n]{\eta_{total}}$
by employing $n-1$ memory stations with spin qubits and $n$ beam-splitter stations including optical
detectors. Our scheme's resource states are similar to the coherent-state-based light-matter
entangled states of a previous hybrid quantum repeater, but unlike the latter our scheme avoids
the necessity of employing $2n-1$ memory stations and writing the transmitted optical states into
the matter memory qubits. The full scaling advantage of this memory-assisted phase-matching QKD
(MA-PM QKD) is obtainable with threshold detectors in a scenario with only channel loss. We present
the obtainable secret-key rates for up to $n=4$ including memory dephasing and for $n=2$ (i.e. $\sqrt[4]{\eta_{total}}$-MA-PM
QKD assisted by a single memory station) for error models including dark counts, memory dephasing
and depolarization, and phase mismatch. By combining the twin-field concept of interfering phase-sensitive
optical states with that of storing quantum states up to a cutoff memory time, distances well beyond
700 km with rates well above $\eta_{total}$ can be reached for realistic, high-quality quantum
memories (up to 1s coherence time) and modest detector efficiencies. Similarly, the standard single-node
quantum repeater, scaling as $\sqrt{\eta_{total}}$, can be beaten when approaching perfect detectors
and exceeding spin coherence times of 5s; beating ideal twin-field QKD requires 1s. As for further
experimental simplifications, our treatment includes the notion of weak nonlinearities for the
light-matter states, a discussion on the possibility of replacing the threshold by homodyne detectors,
and an analysis of sequential instead of parallel entanglement swapping of the memory qubits.
