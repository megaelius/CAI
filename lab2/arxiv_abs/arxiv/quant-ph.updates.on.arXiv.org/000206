Using a microscopic theory, we uncover for $N$ ring-confined rotating particles the existence
of excited states with space-time crystal behavior. We advance a theory of symmetry breaking at
the unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field level, followed by symmetry restoration via projection
techniques, resulting in correlated many-body angular-momentum eigenstates. Superposing a
couple of such symmetry-restored eigenstates belonging to different, judiciously-chosen, angular
momenta, in specific regions accessed through an applied magnetic field, leads to formation of
a family of beyond-mean-field Wigner-molecule broken-symmetry non-stationary trial many-body
wave functions. Time evolution of such pinned states with the microscopic many-body Hamiltonian
exhibits breaking of both space and time translational symmetries. The single-particle densities
corresponding to these broken-symmetry states are inhomogeneous, having $kN$, $k=1,2,\ldots$
humps for $N$ Coulomb-repelling ions, whereas for a lump of contact-interacting attractive bosonic
atoms the densities are characterized by $k= 1,2,\ldots$ humps. Both the quantum space-time proper
($k = 1$ fundamental harmonic) and higher harmonics ($k \geq 2$) are demonstrated. These combined
space- and time-symmetry-broken densities rotate around the ring without dispersion or damping
and with periods $T=\tau/n$, where $\tau = 2\pi\hbar/[E(L_2) - E(L_1)]$ and $E(L_1)$, and $E(L_2)$
are the rotational energies of $N$ interacting particles moving on a ring pierced by an applied magnetic
field, with angular momenta $L_1$ and $L_2$ obeying appropriate selection rules. $n=N$ for the
repelling ions and $n=1$ for the attractive bosons. The microscopically calculated rotational
energies of such ring-trapped particles are found to be well-fitted, for the conditions considered
in this paper, by the spectrum of a rigid Aharonov-Bohm rotor.
