We propose a framework to study the properties of the Lefschetz thimbles decomposition for lattice
fermion models approaching the thermodynamic limit. The proposed set of algorithms includes the
Schur complement solver and the exact computation of the derivatives of the fermion determinant.
It allows us to solve the gradient flow (GF) equations taking into account the fermion determinant
exactly, with high performance. We can find both real and complex saddle points and describe the
structure of the Lefschetz thimbles decomposition for large enough lattices to extrapolate the
results to the thermodynamic limit. The algorithms are described for a general lattice fermion
model, with emphasis on two types of lattice discretizations for relativistic fermions (staggered
and Wilson), as well as on interacting tight-binding models for condensed matter systems. We apply
these algorithms to the Hubbard model on a hexagonal lattice, dealing with lattice volumes as large
as 12x12 with 256 steps in Euclidean time, in order to capture the properties of the thimbles decomposition
as the thermodynamic, low-temperature, and continuum limits are approached. The complexity of
the thimbles decomposition appears to be dependent on the form of the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS)
transformation. In particular, the evidence is provided for the existence of an optimal regime
for the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, with a reduced number of thimbles being important in the
overall sum. We have performed quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations using GF to deform the integration
contour into the complex plane and demonstrated the agreement with exact diagonalization on small
volumes (8 sites in space) if optimal setup for HS transformation is used. The residual sign problem
is compared with the state-of-the-art BSS-QMC. We show that the average sign can be kept substantially
higher using the Lefschetz thimbles approach.
