Recently, Morishima, Futamase and Shimizu published a series of manuscripts, putting forward
arguments, based on a post-Newtonian approximative calculation, that there can be a sizable general
relativistic (GR) correction in the experimental determination of the muon magnetic moment, i.e.,
in muon g-2 experiments. In response, other authors argued that the effect must be much smaller than
claimed. Further authors argued that the effect exactly cancels. Also the known formulae for de
Sitter and Lense-Thirring effect do not apply due to the non-geodesic motion. All this indicates
that it is difficult to estimate from first principles the influence of GR corrections in the problem
of spin propagation. Therefore, in this paper we present a full general relativistic calculation
in order to quantify this effect. The used methodology is the purely differential geometrical tool
of Fermi-Walker transport over a Schwarzschild background. This is compared to the Minkowski limit
in order to quantify the GR corrections. The correction turns out to be of first order in terms of the
Schwarzschild radius over Earth radius, and is suppressed by the squared ratio of the storage ring
radius to the Earth radius, for ultrarelativistic particles. The calculated effect can be basically
attributed to the contribution of GR to the Thomas precession, which appears since the muons are
forced to move on a non-geodesic trajectory. Our calculation, however, does not include the Larmor
precession, which is present in the real experiment, only the Thomas precession of the gyroscopic
motion which is of purely kinematic origin. This estimation yields a negligible relative systematic
error, as a preliminary result.
