Quantum scale symmetry is the realization of scale invariance in a quantum field theory. No parameters
with dimension of length or mass are present in the quantum effective action. Quantum scale symmetry
is generated by quantum fluctuations via the presence of fixed points for running couplings. As
for any global symmetry, the ground state or cosmological state may be scale invariant or not. Spontaneous
breaking of scale symmetry leads to massive particles and predicts a massless Goldstone boson.
A massless particle spectrum follows from scale symmetry of the effective action only if the ground
state is scale symmetric. Approximate scale symmetry close to a fixed point leads to important predictions
for observations in various areas of fundamental physics. We review consequences of scale symmetry
for particle physics, quantum gravity and cosmology. For particle physics, scale symmetry is closely
linked to the tiny ratio between the Fermi scale of weak interactions and the Planck scale for gravity.
For quantum gravity, scale symmetry is associated to the ultraviolet fixed point which allows for
a non-perturbatively renormalizable quantum field theory for all known interactions. The interplay
between gravity and particle physics at this fixed point permits to predict couplings of the standard
model or other "effective low energy models" for momenta below the Planck mass. In particular, quantum
gravity determines the ratio of Higgs boson mass and top quark mass. In cosmology, approximate scale
symmetry explains the almost scale-invariant primordial fluctuation spectrum which is at the
origin of all structures in the universe. The pseudo-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken approximate
scale symmetry may be responsible for dynamical dark energy and a solution of the cosmological constant
problem.
