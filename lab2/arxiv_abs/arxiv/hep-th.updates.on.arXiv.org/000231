We develop a new off-shell formulation for five-dimensional (5D) conformal supergravity obtained
by gauging the 5D superconformal algebra in superspace. An important property of the conformal
superspace introduced is that it reduces to the superconformal tensor calculus (formulated in
the early 2000's) upon gauging away a number of superfluous fields. On the other hand, a different
gauge fixing reduces our formulation to the SU(2) superspace of arXiv:0802.3953 , which is suitable
to describe the most general off-shell supergravity-matter couplings. Using the conformal superspace
approach, we show how to reproduce practically all off-shell constructions derived so far, including
the supersymmetric extensions of $R^2$ terms, thus demonstrating the power of our formulation.
Furthermore, we construct for the first time a supersymmetric completion of the Ricci tensor squared
term using the standard Weyl multiplet coupled to an off-shell vector multiplet. In addition, we
present several procedures to generate higher-order off-shell invariants in supergravity, including
higher-derivative ones. The covariant projective multiplets proposed in arXiv:0802.3953 are
lifted to conformal superspace, and a manifestly superconformal action principle is given. We
also introduce unconstrained prepotentials for the vector multiplet, the ${\cal{O}}(2)$ multiplet
(i.e., the linear multiplet without central charge) and ${\cal{O}}(4+n)$ multiplets, with $n=0,1,\dots$
Superform formulations are given for the BF action and the non-abelian Chern-Simons action. Finally,
we describe locally supersymmetric theories with gauged central charge in conformal superspace.
