In this article we develop an exact(non-adiabatic,non-perturbative) density matrix scattering
theory for a two component quantum liquid which interacts or scatters off from a generic spin-dependent
quantum potential. We find that the number or charge density in scattered fluid,$\text{Tr}({\varrho}_{sc})$
depends on {non-trivial quantum interference coefficients}, ${\cal{Q}}^{\alpha\beta}_{0ijk}$
which arises due to quantum interference between spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering
amplitudes and among spin-dependent scattering amplitudes. The effect of quantum interference
coefficients can be include by defining a {\bf vector order parameter} $\bm{Q}$. We find that in
presence of spin-dependent interaction the {\bf vector order parameter} $\bm{Q}$ is necessarily
non-zero and is related to the commutator and anti-commutator of scattering matrix $\cal{S}$ with
its dagger $\cal{S}^{\dagger}$. It is further shown that $\bm{Q}\neq 0$, implies four physically
equivalent conditions,i.e, {\bf spin-orbital entanglement is non-zero}, {\bf Non-Abelian scattering
phase,i.e, matrices}, scattering matrix is {\bf Non-Unitary} and the broken time reversal symmetry
for scattered density matrix. This also implies that quasi particle excitation are anyonic in nature,
hence, charge fractionalization is a natural consequence. This aspect has also been discussed
from the perspective of number or charge density conservation, which implies i.e, $\text{Tr}({\varrho}_{sc})=\text{Tr}({\varrho}_{in})$.
On the other hand $\bm{Q}=0$ turns out to be a mathematically forced unphysical solution in presence
of spin-dependent potential or scattering which is equivalent to {\bf Abelian} hydrodynamics
,{\bf Unitary} scattering matrix, absence of spin-space entanglement, and preserved time reversal
symmetry.
