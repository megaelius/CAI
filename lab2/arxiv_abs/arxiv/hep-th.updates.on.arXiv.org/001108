Gauge theories possess nonlocal features that, in the presence of boundaries, inevitably lead
to subtleties. In the $D+1$ formulation of Yang-Mills theories, we employ a generalized Helmholtz
decomposition to (i) identify the quasilocal radiative and pure-gauge/Coulombic components
of the gauge and electric fields, and to (ii) study the properties of these components upon gluing
of regions. Being rooted in the geometry of the Yang-Mills configuration space, our decomposition
is naturally carried to the symplectic structure of the theory, similarly decomposing it into a
(bulk) radiative and a (pure-boundary) Coulombic part. Whereas the former encodes the intrinsic
physical content of a region, the latter displays interesting features that e.g. justify the superselection
of the electric flux through the boundary. Concerning the gluing of a topologically-trivial bipartite
system, we prove a formula that uniquely reconstructs the global radiative components of the fields
from their regional counterparts. In the same setup, we also prove that knowledge of both regional
radiative components of the electric field also suffices to reconstruct its regional Coulombic
components: they are found to be functionals of the mismatch of the regional radiatives at the interface
between the two regions. But gluing is not always unique: for non-simply connected manifolds or
for reducible field configurations, identical regional radiative modes may be glued into physically
distinct global configurations. At reducible configurations, the ambiguity is related to the
existence of nontrivial color charges, while the topological ambiguity is are due to the presence
of global Aharonov-Bohm modes. In an appendix, we revisit Dirac's dressing of charged particles
in the non-Abelian context, thus providing an independent entry point to the geometrical tools
subsuming our generalized Helmholtz decomposition.
