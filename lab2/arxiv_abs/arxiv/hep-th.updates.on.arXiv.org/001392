In this paper we analyse the Bianchi IX Universe dynamics within the corner region associated to
the potential term which the spatial curvature induces in the Minisuperspace. The study is done
in the vacuum and in the presence of a massless scalar field $\phi$ and a cosmological constant term
$\Lambda$. We investigate the dynamics in terms of WKB scenario for which the isotropic Misner variables
(the volume) and one of the two anisotropic ones (and $\phi$ when present) are treated on a semi-classical
level, while the remaining anisotropy degree of freedom, the one trapped in the corner, is described
on a pure quantum level. The quantum dynamics always reduces to the one of a time-dependent Schr\"{o}edinger
equation for a harmonic potential with a time dependent frequency. The vacuum case is treated in
the limits of a collpasing and an expanding Universe, while the dynamics in presence of $\phi$ and
$\Lambda$ is studied for $t \rightarrow \infty $. In both analysis the quantum dynamics of the anisotropy
variable is associated to a decaying standard deviation of its probability density, corresponding
to a suppression of the quantum anisotropy associated. In the vacuum case, the corner configuration
becomes an attractor for the dynamics and the evolution resembles that one of a Taub cosmology in
the limit of a non-singular initial Universe. This suggests that if the Bianchi dynamics enters
enough the potential corner then the initial singularity is removed and a Taub picture emerges.
The case when $\phi$ is present well mimics the De-Sitter phase of an inflationary Universe. Here
we show that both the classical and quantum anisotropies are exponentially suppressed, so that
the resulting dynamics corresponds to an isotropic closed Robertson-Walker geometry.
