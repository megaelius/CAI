For any gauge theory, there may be a subgroup of the gauge group which acts trivially on the matter
content. While many physical observables are not sensitive to this fact, the identification of
the precise gauge group becomes crucial when the magnetic spectrum of the theory is considered.
This question is addressed in the context of Coulomb branches for $3$d $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver gauge
theories, which are moduli spaces of dressed monopole operators. Since monopole operators are
characterized by their magnetic charge, the identification of the gauge group is imperative for
the determination of the magnetic lattice. It is well-known that the gauge group of unframed unitary
quivers is the product of all unitary nodes in the quiver modded out by the diagonal $\mathrm{U}(1)$
acting trivially on the matter representation. This reasoning generalises to the notion that a
choice of gauge group associated to a quiver is given by the product of the individual nodes quotiented
by any subgroup that acts trivially on the matter content. For unframed (unitary-) orthosymplectic
quivers composed of $\mathrm{SO}(\textrm{even})$, $\mathrm{USp}$, and possibly $\mathrm{U}$
gauge nodes, the maximal subgroup acting trivially is a diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_2$. For unframed
unitary quivers with a single $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ node it is $\mathbb{Z}_N$. We use this notion to
compute the Coulomb branch Hilbert series of many unitary-orthosymplectic quivers. Examples
include nilpotent orbit closures of the exceptional E-type algebras and magnetic quivers that
arise from brane physics. This includes Higgs branches of theories with 8 supercharges in dimensions
$4$, $5$, and $6$. A crucial ingredient in the calculation of exact refined Hilbert series is the
alternative construction of unframed magnetic quivers from resolved Slodowy slices, whose Hilbert
series can be derived from Hall-Littlewood polynomials.
