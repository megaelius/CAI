In the early-mid 20$^{\rm th}$ century Dirac and Zel'dovich were among the first scientists to suggest
an intimate connection between cosmology and atomic physics. Though a revolutionary proposal
for its time, Dirac's Large Number Hypothesis (1937) adopted a standard assumption of the day, namely,
the non-existence of the cosmological constant term ($\Lambda = 0$). As a result, its implementation
necessitated extreme violence to the theory of general relativity -- something few physicists
were prepared to sacrifice in favour of `numerology' -- requiring a time-dependent gravitational
coupling of the form $G(t) \sim 1/t$. Zel'dovich's insight (1968) was to realise that a small but
nonzero cosmological term ($\Lambda > 0$) allowed the present day radius of the Universe to be identified
with the de Sitter radius, $r_{\rm U} \simeq l_{\rm dS} \simeq 1/{\sqrt{\Lambda}}$, which removed
the need for time-dependence in the fundamental couplings. Thus, he obtained the formula $\Lambda
\simeq m^6G^2/\hbar^4$, where $m$ is a mass scale characterising the relative strengths of the
gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, which he identified with the proton mass $m_{\rm
p}$. In this paper, we review a number of recent arguments which, instead, suggest the identification
$m = m_{\rm e}/\alpha_{\rm e}$, where $m_{\rm e}$ is the electron mass and $\alpha_{\rm e} = e^2/\hbar
c \simeq 1/137$ is the usual fine structure constant. We note that these are of a {\it physical} nature
and, therefore, represent an attempt to lift previous arguments \emph{{\` a} la} Dirac from the
realm of numerology into the realm of empirical science. If valid, such arguments suggest an intimate
connection, not only between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, but, perhaps even more surprisingly,
between the very essence of "dark" and "light" physics.
