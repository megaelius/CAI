In this article, we shall develop and formulate two novel viewpoints and properties concerning
the three-point functions at weak coupling in the SU(2) sector of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory.
One is a double spin-chain formulation of the spin-chain and the associated new interpretation
of the operation of Wick contraction. It will be regarded as a skew symmetric pairing which acts as
a projection onto a singlet in the entire SO(4) sector, instead of an inner product in the spin-chain
Hilbert space. This formalism allows us to study a class of three-point functions of operators built
upon more general spin-chain vacua than the special configuration discussed so far in the literature.
Furthermore, this new viewpoint has the signicant advantage over the conventional method: In the
usual "tailoring" operation, the Wick contraction produces inner products between off-shell
Bethe states, which cannot be in general converted into simple expressions. In contrast, our procedure
directly produces the so-called partial domain wall partition functions, which can be expressed
as determinants. Using this property, we derive simple determinantal representation for a broader
class of three-point functions. The second new property uncovered in this work is the non-trivial
identity satisfied by the three-point functions with monodromy operators inserted. Generically
this relation connects three-point functions of different operators and can be regarded as a kind
of Schwinger-Dyson equation. In particular, this identity reduces in the semiclassical limit
to the triviality of the product of local monodromies around the vertex operators, which played
a crucial role in providing all important global information on the three-point function in the
strong coupling regime. This structure may provide a key to the understanding of the notion of "integrability"
beyond the spectral level.
