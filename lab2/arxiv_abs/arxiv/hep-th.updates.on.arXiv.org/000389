The generic form of spacetime dynamics as a gauge theory has recently been derived, based on only
the action principle and on the general principle of relativity. In the present paper, the physical
consequences are discussed. The gauge coupling terms obtained imply that Einstein's theory holds
only for structureless (spin zero) particles, and aggregations of them. For massive particles
with spin, however, spacetime dynamics is to be described by an additional, Poisson-type equation
describing the interaction of the particle's spin with the torsion of spacetime. This equation
shows that torsion propagates with gravitational waves. Spin carrying matter is thus shown to couple
with the torsion of spacetime. The proper source term for the spacetime dynamics is given by the canonical
energy-momentum tensor---which embraces also the energy density furnished by microscopic internal
spin. This changes the model of compact astrophysical objects and of relativistic collapse dynamics,
with significant impact on the description of binary neutron star mergers and pulsar dynamics.
The final generally covariant Hamiltonian must contain a term quadratic in the conjugate momenta
of the gauge fields in order to yield a closed system of field equations---in analogy to all other
Hamiltonian descriptions of field theories. The fact that the canonical gauge theory of gravity
derived here requires that both, quadratic curvature tensors and canonical energy momentum tensors,
enter the field equation for the spacetime dynamics leads to a qualitatively new framework for general
relativity---and to a new understanding of Friedman cosmology and the cosmological constant problem.
