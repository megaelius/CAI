A gauge theory for a superalgebra that includes an internal gauge (G) and local Lorentz algebras,
and that could describe the low energy particle phenomenology is constructed. These two symmetries
are connected by fermionic supercharges. The system includes an internal gauge connection 1-form
$A$, a spin-1/2 Dirac spinor $\psi$, the Lorentz connection $\omega$, and the vielbein $e$. The
connection one-form is in the adjoint representation of G, while $\psi$ is in the fundamental. In
contrast to standard supergravity, the metric is not a fundamental field and is in the center of the
superalgebra: it is not only invariant under the internal gauge group and under Lorentz transformations,
but is also invariant under supersymmetry. The features of this theory that mark the difference
with standard supersymmetry are: A) The number of fermionic and bosonic states is not necessarily
the same; B) There are no superpartners with equal mass, "bosoninos", sleptons and squarks are absent;
C) Although this supersymmetry originates in a local gauge theory and gravity is included, there
is no gravitino; D) Fermions acquire mass from their coupling to the background or from self-couplings,
while bosons remain massless. In odd dimensions, the Chern-Simons form provides an action that
is quasi-invariant under the entire superalgebra. In even dimensions, the Yang-Mills form $ <
F *F>$ is the only natural option, and the symmetry breaks down to [G x SO(1,D-1)]. In 4D, the construction
follows the Townsend - Mac Dowell-Mansouri approach. Due to the absence of osp(4|2)-invariant
traces in four dimensions, the resulting Lagrangian is only invariant under [U(1) x SO(3,1)], and
includes a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio term. In this case, the Lagrangian depends on a single dimensionful
parameter that fixes Newton's constant, the cosmological constant and the NJL coupling.
