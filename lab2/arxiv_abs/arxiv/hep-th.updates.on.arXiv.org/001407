The out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) function is an important new probe in quantum field
theory which is treated as a significant measure of random quantum correlations. In this paper,
with the slogan "Cosmology meets Condensed Matter Physics" we demonstrate a formalism using which
for the first time we compute the Cosmological OTOC during the stochastic particle production during
inflation and reheating following canonical quantization technique. In this computation, two
dynamical time scales are involved, out of them at one time scale the cosmological perturbation
variable and for the other the canonically conjugate momentum is defined, which is the strict requirement
to define time scale separated quantum operators for OTOC and perfectly consistent with the general
definition of OTOC. Most importantly, using the present formalism not only one can study the quantum
correlation during stochastic inflation and reheating, but also study quantum correlation for
any random events in Cosmology. Next, using the late time exponential decay of cosmological OTOC
with respect to the dynamical time scale of our universe which is associated with the canonically
conjugate momentum operator in this formalism we study the phenomena of quantum chaos by computing
the expression for {\it Lyapunov spectrum}. Further, using the well known Maldacena Shenker Stanford
(MSS) bound, on Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda\leq 2\pi/\beta$, we propose a lower bound on the equilibrium
temperature, $T=1/\beta$, at the very late time scale of the universe. On the other hand, with respect
to the other time scale with which the perturbation variable is associated, we find decreasing but
not exponentially decaying behaviour, which quantifies the random correlation at out-of-equilibrium.
Finally, we have studied the classical limit of the OTOC to check the consistency with the large time
limiting behaviour.
