The phenomenon of spontaneous scalarisation of charged black holes (BHs) has recently motivated
studies of various Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models. Within these models, different classes of
BH solutions are possible, depending on the non-minimal coupling function $f(\phi)$, between
the scalar field and the Maxwell invariant. Here we consider the class wherein both the (bald) electrovacuum
Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) BH and new scalarised BHs co-exist, and the former are never unstable
against scalar perturbations. In particular we examine the model, within this subclass, with a
quartic coupling function: $f(\Phi) = 1+\alpha \Phi ^4$. The domain of existence of the scalarised
BHs, for fixed $\alpha$, is composed of two branches. The first branch (cold scalarised BHs) is continuously
connected to the extremal RN BH. The second branch (hot scalarised BHs) connects to the first one
at the minimum value of the charge to mass ratio and it includes overcharged BHs. We then assess the
perturbative stability of the scalarised solutions, focusing on spherical perturbations. On
the one hand, cold scalarised BHs are shown to be unstable by explicitly computing growing modes.
The instability is quenched at both endpoints of the first branch. On the other hand, hot scalarised
BHs are shown to be stable by using the S-deformation method. Thus, in the spherical sector this model
possesses two stable BH local ground states (RN and hot scalarised). We point out that the branch
structure of BHs in this model parallels the one of BHs in five dimensional vacuum gravity, with [Myer-Perry
BHs, fat rings, thin rings] playing the role of [RN, cold scalarised, hot scalarised] BHs.
