Scenarii with Large Extra Dimensions (LEDs) compactified on a ($q \leq 7$)D torus and with the Standard
Model (SM) fields localized on a 3-brane reformulate the gauge hierarchy problem between the 4D
Planck scale $\Lambda_P^{(4)} \sim 10^{18}$ GeV and the electroweak scale $\Lambda_{EW} \sim
100$ GeV as a geometrical hierarchy problem: gravity is strongly coupled at the $(4+q)D$ Planck
scale $\Lambda_P^{(4+q)} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV, but the compactification radii need to be
stabilized at large values compared to the $(4+q)$D Planck length $1/\Lambda_P^{(4+q)}$. In this
article, we propose to compactify a single LED on a star/rose graph with a large number of identical
leaves/petals of length/circumference of $\mathcal{O}(1/\Lambda_{EW})$, where the 5D Planck
scale is $\Lambda_P^{(5)} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV (without a large geometrical hierarchy to
stabilize). The 4D SM fields are localized at the central vertex of the star/rose graph. We predict
a feebly coupled tower of KK-gravitons invisible in current experiments with a KK scale of $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda_{EW})$.
Our scenarii lead also to TeV scale strongly coupled gravitational phenomena and to an infinite
tower of trans-TeV semi-classical black holes. If there is a stable black hole remnant after evaporation,
the Planckion, it could constitute a part of dark matter. Moreover, we propose a toy model to generate
light Dirac neutrinos, where the right-handed neutrinos are KK modes of gauge singlet fermions
propagating in the extra dimension. In our models, a large number of KK-gravitons and of sterile
KK-neutrinos interact only with gravity and constitute a hidden sector.
