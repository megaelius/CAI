Considered are ${\cal N}=2\, SU(N_c)$ or $U(N_c)$ SQCD with $N_F<2N_c-1$ equal mass quark flavors.
${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry is softly broken down to ${\cal N}=1$ by the mass term $\mu_{\rm x}{\rm
Tr}\,(X^2)$ of colored adjoint scalar partners of gluons, $\mu_{\rm x}\ll\Lambda_2$ ($\Lambda_2$
is the scale factor of the $SU(N_c)$ gauge coupling). There is a large number of different types of
vacua in these theories with both unbroken and spontaneously broken global flavor symmetry, $U(N_F)\rightarrow
U({\rm n}_1)\times U({\rm n}_2)$. We consider in this paper the large subset of these vacua with
the unbroken non-trivial $Z_{2N_c-N_F\geq 2}$ discrete symmetry, at different hierarchies between
the Lagrangian parameters $m\gtrless\Lambda_2,\,\, \mu_{\rm x}\gtrless m$. The forms of low
energy Lagrangians, charges of light particles and mass spectra are described in the main text for
all these vacua. The calculations of power corrections to the leading terms of the low energy quark
and dyon condensates are presented in two important Appendices. The results agree with also presented
in these Appendices independent calculations of these condensates using roots of the Seiberg-Witten
spectral curve. This agreement confirms in a non-trivial way a self-consistency of the whole approach.
Our results differ essentially from corresponding results in e.g. recent related papers arXiv:1304.0822,
arXiv:1403.6086 and arXiv:1704.06201 of M.Shifman and A.Yung (and in a number of their previous
numerous papers on this subject), and we explain in the text the reasons for these differences. (See
also the extended critique of a number of results of these authors in section 8 of arXiv:1308.5863).
