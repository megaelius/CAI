The generic form of spacetime dynamics as a classical gauge field theory has recently been derived,
based on only the action principle and on the Principle of General Relativity. It was thus shown that
Einstein's General Relativity is the special case where (i) the Hilbert Lagrangian (essentially
the Ricci scalar) is supposed to describe the dynamics of the "free" (uncoupled) gravitational
field, and (ii) the energy-momentum tensor is that of scalar fields representing real or complex
structureless (spin-$0$) particles. It followed that all other source fields---such as vector
fields representing massive and non-massive spin-$1$ particles---need careful scrutiny of the
appropriate source tensor. This is the subject of our actual paper: we discuss in detail the coupling
of the gravitational field with (i) a massive complex scalar field, (ii) a massive real vector field,
and (iii) a massless vector field. We show that different couplings emerge for massive and non-massive
vector fields. The \emph{massive} vector field has the \emph{canonical} energy-momentum tensor
as the appropriate source term---which embraces also the energy density furnished by the internal
spin. In this case, the vector fields are shown to generate a torsion of spacetime. In contrast, the
system of a \emph{massless} and charged vector field is associated with the \emph{metric} (Hilbert)
energy-momentum tensor due to its additional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry. Moreover, such vector
fields do not generate a torsion of spacetime. The respective sources of gravitation apply for all
models of the dynamics of the `free' (uncoupled) gravitational field---which do not follow from
the gauge formalism but must be specified based on separate physical reasoning.
