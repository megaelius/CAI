We continue to develop the pure connection formalism for gravity. We derive the Feynman rules for
computing the connection correlation functions, as well as the prescription for obtaining the
Minkowski space graviton scattering amplitudes from the latter. The present formalism turns out
to be simpler than the metric based one in many aspects. Simplifications result from the fact that
the conformal factor of the metric, a source of complications in the usual approach, does not propagate
in the connection formulation even off-shell. This simplifies both the linearized theory and the
interactions. For comparison, in our approach the complete off-shell cubic GR interaction contains
just 3 terms, which should be compared to at least a dozen terms in the metric formalism. We put the
technology developed to use and compute the simplest graviton-graviton scattering amplitudes.
For GR we reproduce the well-known result. For our other, distinct from GR, interacting theories
of massless spin 2 particles we obtain non-zero answers for some parity-violating amplitudes.
Thus, in the convention that all particles are incoming, we find that the 4 minus, as well as the 3 minus
1 plus amplitudes are zero (as in GR), but the amplitudes with 4 gravitons of positive helicity, as
well as the 3 plus 1 minus amplitudes are different from zero. This serves as a good illustration of
the type of parity violation present in these theories. We find that the parity-violating amplitudes
are important at high energies, and that a general parity-violating member of our class of theories
"likes" one helicity (negative in our conventions) more than the other in the sense that at high energies
it tends to convert all present gravitons into those of negative helicity.
