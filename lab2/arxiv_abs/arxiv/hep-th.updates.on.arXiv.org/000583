In this paper, we develop an analogy between the three level atomic system so called Lambda system
and scattering processes in quantum electrodynamics (QED). In a Lambda system we have two ground
state levels $|1 \rangle$ and $|3 \rangle$ at energy $E_1$ and excited level $|2 \rangle$ at energy
$E_2$. The transition from $|1 \rangle$ to $|2 \rangle$ has strength $\Omega_1$ and transition
from $|2 \rangle$ to $|3 \rangle$ has strength $\Omega_2$. When we adiabatically eliminate the
excited state, i.e. go in the interaction frame of natural Hamiltonian of the system, we get a second
order term connecting level $|1 \rangle$ to $|3 \rangle$ with strength $\frac{\Omega_1\Omega_2}{E_1-E_2}$.
This term creates an effective coupling between ground state levels and drives transition from
$|1 \rangle$ to $| 3\rangle$. Scattering processes in QED can be modelled like this. Feynman amplitudes
are calculation of second order term ${\cal M} = \frac{\Omega_1\Omega_2}{E_1-E_2}$. In the rest
frame $O'$ (CM frame) where sum of momentum of incoming particles is $0$, if the Feynman amplitude
is ${\cal M'}$, then in a frame $O$ in which $O'$ moves with velocity $v$ , the time gets dilated to $t
= \frac{t'}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ and hence it must be true that ${\cal M} = {\cal M'} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$.
We show that to make this relativistic invariance of $\M$ to work, we have to modify the QED interaction
Hamiltonian. Using this modification, we calculate the scattering amplitude for QED processes,
Compton scattering and M{\o}ller Scattering. This gives an additional factor of $\frac{\bf P}{P_0}$
in Feynman amplitude, where $P$ is sum of four momentum of incoming particles (or outgoing) and ${\bf
P} = \sqrt{P^2}$. In this paper taking vacuum polarization as a example, we show that we can avoid
divergences in QED if we correctly work with this factor $\frac{\bf P}{P_0}$.
