\ \ \ Horizonless spacetimes describing highly compact exotic objects with reflecting (instead
of absorbing) surfaces have recently attracted much attention from physicists and mathematicians
as possible quantum-gravity alternatives to canonical classical black-hole spacetimes. Interestingly,
it has recently been proved that spinning compact objects with angular momenta in the {\it sub}-critical
regime ${\bar a}\equiv J/M^2\leq1$ are characterized by an {\it infinite} countable set of surface
radii, $\{r_{\text{c}}({\bar a};n)\}^{n=\infty}_{n=1}$, that can support asymptotically
flat static configurations made of massless scalar fields. In the present paper we study {\it analytically}
the physical properties of {\it ultra}-spinning exotic compact objects with dimensionless angular
momenta in the complementary regime ${\bar a}>1$. It is proved that ultra-spinning reflecting
compact objects with dimensionless angular momenta in the {\it super}-critical regime $\sqrt{1-[{{m}/{(l+2)}}]^2}\leq|{\bar
a}|^{-1}<1$ are characterized by a {\it finite} discrete family of surface radii, $\{r_{\text{c}}({\bar
a};n)\}^{n=N_{\text{r}}}_{n=1}$, distributed symmetrically around $r=M$, that can support
spatially regular static configurations of massless scalar fields (here the integers $\{l,m\}$
are the harmonic indices of the supported static scalar field modes). Interestingly, the largest
supporting surface radius $r^{\text{max}}_{\text{c}}({\bar a})\equiv \text{max}_n\{r_{\text{c}}({\bar
a};n)\}$ marks the onset of superradiant instabilities in the composed ultra-spinning-exotic-compact-object-massless-scalar-field
system.
