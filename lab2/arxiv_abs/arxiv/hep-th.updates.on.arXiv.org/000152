We analyze the quantum-corrected moduli space of D7-brane position moduli with special emphasis
on inflationary model building. D7-brane deformation moduli are key players in two recently proposed
inflationary scenarios: The first, D7-brane chaotic inflation, is a variant of axion monodromy
inflation which allows for an effective 4d supergravity description. The second, fluxbrane inflation,
is a stringy version of D-term hybrid inflation. Both proposals rely on the fact that D7-brane coordinates
enjoy a shift-symmetric Kahler potential at large complex structure of the Calabi-Yau threefold,
making them naturally lighter than other fields. This shift symmetry is inherited from the mirror-dual
Type IIA Wilson line on a D6-brane at large volume. The inflaton mass can be provided by a tree-level
term in the flux superpotential. It induces a monodromy and, if tuned to a sufficiently small value,
can give rise to a large-field model of inflation. Alternatively, by a judicious flux choice one
can completely avoid a tree-level mass term, in which case the inflaton potential is induced via
loop corrections. The positive vacuum energy can then be provided by a D-term, leading to a small-field
model of hybrid natural inflation. In the present paper, we continue to develop a detailed understanding
of the D7-brane moduli space focusing among others on shift-symmetry-preserving flux choices,
flux-induced superpotential in Type IIB and F-theory language, and loop corrections. While the
inflationary applications represent our main physics motivation, we expect that some of our findings
will be useful for other phenomenological issues involving 7-branes in Type IIB/F-theory constructions.
