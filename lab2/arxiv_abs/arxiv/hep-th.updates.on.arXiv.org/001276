In this paper, we study four-dimensional topological black hole solutions of Einsteinian cubic
gravity in the presence of nonlinear Born-Infeld electrodynamics and cosmological constant.
First, we obtain the field equations which govern our solutions. Employing Abbott-Deser and Gauss
formulas, we present the expressions of conserved quantities total mass and total charge of our
topological black holes. Next, we put the expansion of metric function near horizon in field equation
and solve the latter order by order to obtain the temperature as well as total mass. Moreover, we discuss
the effect of different model parameters on the behavior of temperature. We find out that, for black
solutions with planar and hyperbolic topologies on horizon, the temperature may be positive just
for negative cosmological constant. However, spherical solutions may have positive temperature
for positive, negative and zero values of cosmological constant. We reveal that the temperature
decreases as charge of black holes and nonlinear parameter $b$ increase (large $b$ reproduces linear
electrodynamics) for all topology types. Whereas the temperature of planar solutions is independent
of cubic coupling $\lambda $, temperature of spherical (hyperbolic) solutions decreases (increases)
as $\lambda $ grows. Also, it is shown that spherical solutions have a maximum value for temperature
unlike the solutions with two other topologies. Next, we turn to calculate entropy and electric
potential. We show that the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied for our solutions. Finally,
we explore the thermal stability of our solutions. We reveal the influence of model parameters on
stability of topological Born-Infeld charged black solutions of Einsteinian cubic gravity.
