We elaborate conformal higher-spin gauge theory in three-dimensional (3D) curved space. For any
integer $n>2$, we introduce a conformal spin-$\frac{n}{2}$ gauge field $h_{(n)} =h_{\alpha_1\dots
\alpha_n}$ (with $n$ spinor indices) of dimension $(2-n/2)$ and argue that it possesses a Weyl primary
descendant $C_{(n)}$ of dimension $(1+n/2)$, which is divergenceless and gauge invariant in every
conformally flat space. Primary fields $C_{(3)}$ and $C_{(4)}$ coincide with the linearised Cottino
and Cotton tensors, respectively. The properties of $C_{(n)}$ imply that the Chern-Simons-type
action $S_{\rm{CS}}^{(n)} \propto \int {\rm d}^3 x \, e\, h^{\alpha(n)} C_{\alpha(n) }$ is Weyl
and gauge invariant in any conformally flat space. The actions $S_{\rm{CS}}^{(n)} $, which for
$n>4$ are higher-spin extensions of linearised conformal gravity, are used to construct gauge-invariant
formulations for massive higher-spin fields in Minkowski and anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. As is
known, the irreducible unitary massive spin-$\frac{n}{2}$ representations of the 3D Poincar\'e
and AdS groups (for $n>1$) are realised in terms of symmetric rank-$n$ spinor fields obeying first-order
differential equations. We demonstrate that these equations follow from the equations of motion
in certain higher-derivative gauge theories. If $n=2s$, our massive action is $S_{\rm massive}^{(2s)}=\lambda
S_{\rm{CS}}^{(2s)} +\mu^{2s-3}S_{\rm{F}}^{(2s)}$, where $S_{\rm{F}}^{(2s)} $ denotes the
Fronsdal-type action for a massless spin-$s$ field in $\rm AdS_3$. If $n=2s+1$, our massive action
is $S_{\rm massive}^{(2s+1)}=\lambda S_{\rm{CS}}^{(2s+1)}+\mu^{2s-1}S_{\rm{FF}}^{(2s+1)}$,
where $S_{\rm{FF}}^{(2s+1)} $ denotes the Fang-Fronsdal-type action for a massless spin-$(s+1/2)$
field in $\rm AdS_3$. Finally we develop ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric extensions of the above results.
