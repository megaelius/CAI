The 3d spin-3 gravity theory is holographically dual to a 2d ${\cal W}_3$-extended CFT. In a large-c
limit the symmetry algebra of the CFT reduces to $SU(1,2) \times SU(1,2)$. On the ground of symmetry
the dual bulk space-time will be given by an 8d group manifold $SU(1,2)$. Hence we need to introduce
five extra coordinates in addition to three ordinary ones. The 3d space-time is a 3d hyper-surface
$\Sigma$ embedded at constant values of the extra variables. Operators in the CFT at the boundary
of $\Sigma$ are expressed in terms of ${\cal W}$ descendants of the operators at the boundary of $\Sigma_0$,
where the extra variables vanish. In this paper it is shown that AdS/CFT correspondence for a scalar
field coupled to 3d spin-3 gravity is realized in this auxiliary 8d space. A bulk-to-boundary propagator
of a scalar field is found and a generating functional of boundary two-point functions of scalar
${\cal W}$-descendant operators is obtained by using the classical action for the scalar field.
Classically, the scalar field must satisfy both Klein-Gordon equation and a third-order differential
equation, which are related to the quadratic and cubic Casimir operators of $su(1,2)$. It is found
that the coefficient function of the derivatives of the scalar field in the latter equation is the
spin-3 gauge field, when restricted to the hypersurface. An action integral in the 8d auxiliary
space for the 3d spin-3 gravity coupled to a scalar field is presented. An 8d local frame is introduced
and the equations of motion for the 8d connections $A_{\mu}$, $\overline{A}_{\mu}$ are solved.
By restricting those solutions onto $\Sigma$, flat connections in 3d $SL(3,\mathbb{R}) \times
SL(3,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory are obtained and new 3d black hole solutions with and without
spin-3 charge are found by this method.
