The universal character of the gravitational interaction provided by the equivalence principle
motivates a geometrical description of gravity. The standard formulation of General Relativity
\`a la Einstein attributes gravity to the spacetime curvature, to which we have grown accustomed.
However, this perception has masked the fact that two alternative, though equivalent, formulations
of General Relativity in flat spacetimes exist, where gravity can be fully ascribed either to torsion
or to non-metricity. The latter allows a simpler geometrical formulation of General Relativity
that is oblivious to the affine spacetime structure. Generalisations along this line permit to
generate teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity with exceptional properties.
In this work we explore modified gravity theories based on non-linear extensions of the non-metricity
scalar. After presenting some general properties and briefly studying some interesting background
cosmologies (including accelerating solutions with relevance for inflation and dark energy),
we analyse the behaviour of the cosmological perturbations. Tensor perturbations feature a re-scaling
of the corresponding Newton's constant, while vector perturbations do not contribute in the absence
of vector sources. In the scalar sector we find two additional propagating modes, hinting that $f(Q)$
theories introduce, at least, two additional degrees of freedom. These scalar modes disappear
around maximally symmetric backgrounds because of the appearance of an accidental residual gauge
symmetry corresponding to a restricted diffeomorphism. We finally discuss the potential strong
coupling problems of these maximally symmetric backgrounds caused by the discontinuity in the
number of propagating modes.
