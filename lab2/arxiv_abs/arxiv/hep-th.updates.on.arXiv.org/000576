We examine the thermodynamic features of \emph{inner} and outer horizons of modified gravity~(MOG)
and its consequences on the holographic duality. We derive the thermodynamic product relations
for this gravity. We consider both spherically symmetric solutions and axisymmetric solutions
of MOG. We find that the area product formula for both cases is \emph{not} mass-independent because
they depends on the ADM mass parameter while in \emph{Einstein gravity} this formula is mass-independent~(universal).
We also explicitly verify the \emph{first law} which is fulfilled at the inner horizon~(IH) as well
as at the outer horizon~(OH). We derive thermodynamic products and sums for this kind of gravity.
We further derive the \emph{Smarr like mass formula} for this kind of black hole~(BH) in MOG. Moreover,
we derive the area bound for both the horizons. Furthermore, we show that the central charges of the
left and right moving sectors are the same via universal thermodynamic relations. We also discuss
the most important result of the \emph{Kerr-MOG/CFT correspondence}. We derive the central charges
for Kerr-MOG BH which is $c_{L}=12J$ and it is similar to Kerr BH. We also derive the dimensionless
temperature of a extreme Kerr-MOG BH which is $T_{L} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\alpha+2}{\sqrt{1+\alpha}}$,
where $\alpha$ is a MOG parameter. This is actually dual CFT temperature of the Frolov-Thorne thermal
vacuum state. In the limit $\alpha=0$, we find the dimensionless temperature of Kerr BH. Consequently,
Cardy formula gives us microscopic entropy for extreme Kerr-MOG BH, $S_{micro} = \frac{\alpha+2}{\sqrt{1+\alpha}}
\pi J $ for the CFT which is completely in agreement with macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
