By using complex angular momentum techniques, we study the electromagnetic radiation generated
by a charged particle falling radially from infinity into a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider
both the case of a particle initially at rest and that of a particle projected with a relativistic
velocity and we construct complex angular momentum representations and Regge pole approximations
of the partial wave expansions defining the Maxwell scalar $\phi_2$ and the energy spectrum $dE/d\omega$
observed at spatial infinity. We show, in particular, that Regge pole approximations involving
only one Regge pole provide effective ressumations of these partial wave expansions permitting
us (i) to reproduce with very good agreement the black hole ringdown without requiring a starting
time, (ii) to describe with rather good agreement the tail of the signal and sometimes the pre-ringdown
phase and (iii) to explain the oscillations in the electromagnetic energy spectrum radiated by
the charged particle. The present work as well as a previous one concerning the gravitational radiation
generated by a massive particle falling into a Schwarzschild black hole [A. Folacci and M. Ould El
Hadj, Phys, Rev, D$\textbf{98}$, 064052, (2018), arXiv:1807.09056 [gr-qc]] highlight the benefits
of studying radiation from black holes in the complex angular momentum framework (they obviously
appear when the approximations obtained involve a small number of Regge poles and have a clear physical
interpretation) but also to exhibit the limits of this approach (this is the case when it is necessary
to take into account background integral contributions).
