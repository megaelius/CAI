It is argued that the "Big Bang" initiating the creation of our Universe may be a consequence of a first-order
phase transition induced by interaction of a fundamental non-linear scalar field with gravitational
field. The Lagrangian describing the scalar field f characterized by "imaginary mass" and nonlinearity
of {\phi}^4 type, existing in the space-time with non-zero scalar curvature R, is proposed to be
augmented with an additional linear term ~R{\phi}, along with the standard term ~R|{\phi}|^2 quadratic
in {\phi}. The term linear in {\phi}, playing the role of an "external field", leads to a cubic equation
in {\phi} for the extrema of the potential energy of the scalar field and ensures the possibility
of a first-order phase transition driven by the parameter proportional to R. It is assumed that the
early Universe is filled with non-linear scalar field in the ground state and cold matter, neutral
with respect to all charges, satisfying the equation of state p={\nu}{\epsilon}. It is shown that
given the condition {\nu}>1/3 the scalar curvature R={\kappa}(3{\nu}-1){\epsilon}-4{\Lambda}
(where {\Lambda} is the cosmological constant) decreases with diminishing of the energy density
of matter during the Universe's expansion and reaches certain critical value R_c<0 when the
first-order phase transition occurs. Using parameters characterizing the Higgs' field, the rapid
"roll-down" of the system into the potential minimum is shown to take place in a time span of about
10^-31 s. During this time the latent heat of the transition is released increasing the temperature
of the Universe to the Plank's values T_P=10^32 K, which may be seen as the "Big Bang" producing 4*10^30
GW of power.
