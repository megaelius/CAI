For a complete description of the physical properties of low-energy QCD, it might be advantageous
to first reformulate QCD in terms of gauge-invariant dynamical variables, before applying any
approximation schemes. Using a canonical transformation of the dynamical variables, which Abelianises
the non-Abelian Gauss-law constraints to be implemented, such a reformulation can be achieved
for QCD. The exact implementation of the Gauss laws reduces the colored spin-1 gluons and spin-1/2
quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0, spin-1, spin-2 and spin-3 glueball fields and colorless
Rarita-Schwinger fields respectively. The obtained physical Hamiltonian can then be rewritten
into a form, which separates the rotational from the scalar degrees of freedom, and admits a systematic
strong-coupling expansion in powers of lambda=g^{-2/3}, equivalent to an expansion in the number
of spatial derivatives. The leading-order term in this expansion corresponds to non-interacting
hybrid-glueballs, whose low-lying masses can be calculated with high accuracy by solving the Schr\"odinger-equation
of the Dirac-Yang-Mills quantum mechanics of spatially constant physical fields (at the moment
only for the 2-color case). Due to the presence of classical zero-energy valleys of the chromomagnetic
potential for two arbitrarily large classical glueball fields (the unconstrained analogs of the
well-known constant Abelian fields), practically all glueball excitation energy is expected
to go into the increase of the strengths of these two fields. Higher-order terms in lambda lead to
interactions between the hybrid-glueballs and can be taken into account systematically using
perturbation theory in lambda.
