Three-dimensional Chern-Simons vector models display an approximate higher spin symmetry in
the large $N$ limit. Their single-trace operators consist of a tower of weakly broken currents,
as well as a scalar $\sigma$ of approximate twist $1$ or $2$. We study the consequences of crossing
symmetry for the four-point correlator of $\sigma$ in a $1/N$ expansion, using analytic bootstrap
techniques. To order $1/N$ we show that crossing symmetry fixes the contribution from the tower
of currents, providing an alternative derivation of well-known results by Maldacena and Zhiboedov.
When $\sigma$ has twist $1$ its OPE receives a contribution from the exchange of $\sigma$ itself
with an arbitrary coefficient, due to the existence of a marginal sextic coupling. We develop the
machinery to determine the corrections to the OPE data of double-trace operators due to this, and
to similar exchanges. This in turns allows us to fix completely the correlator up to three known truncated
solutions to crossing. We then proceed to study the problem to order $1/N^2$. We find that crossing
implies the appearance of odd-twist double-trace operators, and calculate their OPE coefficients
in a large spin expansion. Also, surprisingly, crossing at order $1/N^2$, implies non-trivial
$O(1/N)$ anomalous dimensions for even-twist double-trace operators, even though such contributions
do not appear in the four-point function at order $1/N$ (in the case where there is no scalar exchange).
We argue that this phenomenon arises due to operator mixing. Finally, we analyse the bosonic vector
model with a sextic coupling without gauge interactions, and determine the order $1/N^2$ corrections
to the dimensions of twist-$2$ double-trace operators.
