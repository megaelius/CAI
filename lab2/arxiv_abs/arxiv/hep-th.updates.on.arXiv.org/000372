The spectral dimension measures the dimensionality of a space as witnessed by a diffusing random
walker. Within the causal dynamical triangulations approach to the quantization of gravity, the
spectral dimension exhibits novel scale-dependent dynamics: reducing towards a value near 2 on
sufficiently small scales, matching closely the topological dimension on intermediate scales,
and decaying in the presence of positive curvature on sufficiently large scales. I report the first
comprehensive scaling analysis of the small-to-intermediate scale spectral dimension for the
test case of the causal dynamical triangulations of 3-dimensional Einstein gravity. I find that
the spectral dimension scales trivially with the diffusion constant. I find that the spectral dimension
is completely finite in the infinite volume limit, and I argue that its maximal value is exactly consistent
with the topological dimension of 3 in this limit. I find that the spectral dimension reduces further
towards a value near 2 as this case's bare coupling approaches its phase transition, and I present
evidence against the conjecture that the bare coupling simply sets the overall scale of the quantum
geometry. On the basis of these findings, I advance a tentative physical explanation for the dynamical
reduction of the spectral dimension observed within causal dynamical triangulations: branched
polymeric quantum geometry on sufficiently small scales. My analyses should facilitate attempts
to employ the spectral dimension as a physical observable with which to delineate renormalization
group trajectories in the hope of taking a continuum limit of causal dynamical triangulations at
a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point.
