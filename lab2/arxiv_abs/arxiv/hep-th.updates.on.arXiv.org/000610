We apply and extend the theory of universal recovery channels from quantum information theory to
address the problem of entanglement wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT. It has recently been proposed
that any low-energy local bulk operators in a CFT boundary region's entanglement wedge can be reconstructed
on that boundary region itself. Existing work arguing for this proposal relies on algebraic consequences
of the exact equivalence between bulk and boundary relative entropies, namely the theory of operator
algebra quantum error correction. However, bulk and boundary relative entropies are only approximately
equal in bulk effective field theory, and in similar situations it is known that predictions from
exact entropic equalities can be qualitatively incorrect. The framework of universal recovery
channels provides a robust demonstration of the entanglement wedge reconstruction conjecture
in addition to new physical insights. Most notably, we find that a bulk operator acting in a given
boundary region's entanglement wedge can be expressed as the response of the boundary region's
modular Hamiltonian to a perturbation of the bulk state in the direction of the bulk operator. This
formula can be interpreted as a noncommutative version of Bayes' rule that attempts to undo the noise
induced by restricting to only a portion of the boundary, and has an integral representation in terms
of modular flows. To reach these conclusions, we extend the theory of universal recovery channels
to finite-dimensional operator algebras and demonstrate that recovery channels approximately
preserve the multiplicative structure of the operator algebra.
