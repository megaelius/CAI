We suggest a further generalization of the hypergeometric-like series due to M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi
by substituting the Pochhammer symbol with a nearly arbitrary function. Moreover, this generalization
is valid for the entire Shiraishi series, not only for its Noumi-Shiraishi part. The theta function
needed in the recently suggested description of the double-elliptic systems, 6d N=2* SYM instanton
calculus and the doubly-compactified network models, is a very particular member of this huge family.
The series depends on two kinds of variables, $\vec x$ and $\vec y$, and on a set of parameters, which
becomes infinitely large now. Still, one of the parameters, $p$ is distinguished by its role in the
series grading. When $\vec y$ are restricted to a discrete subset labeled by Young diagrams, the
series multiplied by a monomial factor reduces to a polynomial at any given order in $p$. All this
makes the map from functions to the hypergeometric-like series very promising, and we call it Shiraishi
functor despite it remains to be seen, what are exactly the morphisms that it preserves. Generalized
Noumi-Shiraishi (GNS) symmetric polynomials inspired by the Shiraishi functor in the leading
order in $p$ can be obtained by a triangular transform from the Schur polynomials and possess an interesting
grading. They provide a family of deformations of Macdonald polynomials, as rich as the family of
Kerov functions, still very different from them, and, in fact, much closer to the Macdonald polynomials.
In particular, unlike the Kerov case, these polynomials do not depend on the ordering of Young diagrams
in the triangular expansion.
