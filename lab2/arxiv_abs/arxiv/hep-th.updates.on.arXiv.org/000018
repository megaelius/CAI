We present an analytical study of continuum 4d SU(2) gauge Higgs models with a single Higgs field
with fixed length in either the fundamental or adjoint representation. We aim at analytically probing
the renowned predictions of Fradkin & Shenker on the phase diagram in terms of confinement versus
Higgs behaviour, obtained for the lattice version of the model. We work in the Landau version of the
't Hooft R_\xi gauges in which case we can access potential nonperturbative physics related to the
existence of the Gribov copies. In the fundamental case, we clearly show that in the perturbative
regime of small gauge coupling constant g and large Higgs vacuum expectation value v, there is a Higgs
phase with Yukawa gauge boson propagators without Gribov effects. For a small value of the Higgs
vev v and/or large g, we enter a region with Gribov type propagators that have no physical particle
interpretation: the gauge bosons are as such confined. The transition between both behaviours
is found to be continuous. In the adjoint case, we find evidence of a more drastic transition between
the different behaviours for the propagator of the off-diagonal gauge bosons, whereas the "photon",
i.e. the diagonal component of the gauge field, displays a propagator of the Gribov type. In the limit
of infinite Higgs condensate, we show that a massless photon is recovered. We compare our findings
with those of Fradkin & Shenker as well as with more recent numerical lattice simulations of
the fundamental Higgs model. We also carefully discuss in which region of the parameter space (v,g)
our approximations are trustworthy.
