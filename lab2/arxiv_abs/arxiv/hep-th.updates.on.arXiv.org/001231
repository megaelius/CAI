We extend the cosmological predictions from assuming the total action of the universe is finite.
When initial and final singularities in curvature invariants are avoided, it leads to singularities
in the gravitational action of the universe. The following properties are required of a universe
with finite action: Compact spatial sections (ie a closed universe) giving a finite total lifetime
for the universe. Compactification of flat and open universes is excluded. The universe can contain
perfect fluids with -1<p/\r{ho}<2 on approach to singularities. The universe cannot display a
bounce' or indefinite cyclic behaviour to the past or the future. We find new consequences of imposing
finite action: the universe cannot be dominated by massless scalar fields, the kinetic energy of
scalar fields, or a p=\r{ho} perfect fluid on approach to the initial or final singularity The ekpyrotic
scenario with an effective fluid obeying p/\r{ho}>2 in a closed, flat or open universe is excluded.
Any bouncing model with indefinite past or future evolution is ruled out. Einstein static and steady-state
universes are ruled out along with past or future eternal inflating universes. Anisotropies cannot
dominate the dynamics at singularities. This excludes density inhomogeneity spectra versus mass,
of the form {\delta}\r{ho}/\r{ho}proportional to M^{-q}, with q>2/3.Higher-order lagrangian
theories of gravity are constrained. The Gauss-Bonnet combination causes an action singularity
even though it does not contribute terms to the field equations. Scalar-tensor theories dominated
by the scalar field on approach to singularities have action singularities. Dark energy cannot
be a cosmological constant. The dark energy must evolve in a closed universe that collapses to a future
singularity that cannot be dominated by the kinetic energy of the scalar field.
