Generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) are one type of three-dimensional structure functions,
and they are related to the generalized distribution functions (GPDs) by the $s$-$t$ crossing of
the Mandelstam variables. The GDA studies provide information on three-dimensional tomography
of hadrons. The GDAs can be investigated by the two-photon process $\gamma^* \gamma \to h\bar h$,
and the GPDs are studied by the deeply virtual Compton scattering $\gamma^* h \to \gamma h$. The GDA
studies had been pure theoretical topics, although the GPDs have been experimentally investigated,
because there was no available experimental measurement. Recently, the Belle collaboration reported
their measurements on the $\gamma^* \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ differential cross section, so that
it became possible to find the GDAs from their measurements. Here, we report our analysis of the Belle
data for determining the pion GDAs. From the GDAs, the timelike gravitational form factors $\Theta_1
(s)$ and $\Theta_2 (s)$ can be calculated, which are mechanical (pressure, shear force) and mass
(energy) form factors, respectively. They are converted to the spacelike form factors by using
the dispersion relation, and then gravitational radii are evaluated for the pion. The mass and mechanical
radii are obtained from $\Theta_2$ and $\Theta_1$ as $\sqrt {\langle r^2 \rangle_{\text{mass}}}
=0.56 \sim 0.69$ fm and $\sqrt {\langle r^2 \rangle_{\text{mech}}} =1.45 \sim 1.56$ fm, whereas
the experimental charge radius is $\sqrt {\langle r^2 \rangle_{\text{charge}}} =0.672 \pm 0.008$
fm for the charged pion. Future developments are expected in this new field to explore gravitational
physics in the quark and gluon level.
