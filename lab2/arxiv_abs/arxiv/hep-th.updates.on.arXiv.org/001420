Recently, there has been quite a lot of interest in static, spherical wormhole spacetimes and the
question of their stability with respect to time-dependent perturbations. The consideration
of linearized perturbations usually leads to a master wave equation with effective potential which
can then be analyzed using standard tools from quantum mechanics. However, in the wormhole case,
particular care must be taken with the gauge conditions when formulating the master equation. A
poor coordinate choice, based for example on fixing the areal radial coordinate, may lead to singularities
at the throat which complicate the stability analysis or might even lead to erroneous conclusions
regarding the stability of the underlying wormhole configuration. In this work, we present a general
method for deriving a gauge-invariant wave system of linearized perturbation equations in the
spherically symmetric case, assuming that the matter supporting the wormhole is a phantom scalar
field, that is, a self-interacting scalar field whose kinetic energy has the reversed sign. We show
how this system can be decoupled and reduced to a single master wave equation with a regular potential,
with no intermediate steps involving singularities at the throat. Two applications of our formalism
are given. First, we rederive the master equation for the linearly perturbed Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole
using our new, singularity-free method. Second, we derive the master equation describing the linear
perturbations of a certain Anti de Sitter wormhole, provide a detailed analysis of the spectral
properties of the underlying operator and prove that this wormhole is linearly unstable. In the
final part of the paper, we consider a wormhole with de Sitter-type ends, whose spacetime presents
horizons and admits a nonstatic extension beyond them; for this system we derive partial results
of linear instability.
