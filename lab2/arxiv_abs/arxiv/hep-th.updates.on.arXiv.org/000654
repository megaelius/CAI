We analyze the electromagnetic-gravity interaction in a pure Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz framework.
To do so we formulate the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity in 4+1 dimensions and perform a Kaluza-Klein
reduction to 3+1 dimensions. The complete $z=4$ theory is in principle power-counting renormalizable.
The critical value of the dimensionless coupling constant in the kinetic term of the action is $\lambda=1/4$.
The relativistic symmetry of the kinetic term for $\lambda=1$ is broken by the potential terms in
the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz formulation leaving the only critical value of the action to be $\lambda=1/4$.
It is the kinetic conformal point for the non-relativistic gravity-electromagnetic interaction.
In distinction, the corresponding kinetic conformal value for pure Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity
in 3+1 dimensions is $\lambda=1/3$. The critical value is protected from quantum corrections by
the presence of a second class constraint. We analyze the geometrical structure of the critical
and noncritical cases, they correspond to different theories. The physical degrees of freedom
propagated by the noncritical theory are the transverse traceless graviton, the transverse gauge
vector and two scalar fields. In the critical theory one of the scalars is absent, only the dilaton
scalar field is present. The gravity and vector excitations propagate with the same speed, which
at low energy can be taken to be the speed of light. The field equations for the gauge vector in the non-relativistic
theory have exactly the same form as the relativistic electromagnetic field equations arising
from the Kaluza-Klein reduction of General Relativity and are equal to them for a particular value
of one of the coupling constants. The gauge vector is now coupled to the anisotropic Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz
gravity. The potential in the Hamiltonian is a polynomial of finite grade in the gauge vector and
its covariant derivatives.
