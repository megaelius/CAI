In a galactic halo like the Milky Way, bosonic dark matter particles lighter than about $100$ eV have
a de Broglie wavelength larger than the average inter-particle separation and are therefore well
described as a set of classical waves. This applies to, for instance, the QCD axion as well as to lighter
axion-like particles such as fuzzy dark matter. We show that the interference of waves inside a halo
inevitably leads to vortices, locations where chance destructive interference takes the density
to zero. The phase of the wavefunction has non-trivial winding around these points. This can be interpreted
as a non-zero velocity circulation, so that vortices are sites where the fluid velocity has a non-vanishing
curl. Using analytic arguments and numerical simulations, we study the properties of vortices
and show they have a number of universal features: (1) In three spatial dimensions, the generic defects
take the form of vortex rings. (2) On average there is about one vortex ring per de Broglie volume and
(3) generically only single winding ($\pm 1$) vortices are found in a realistic halo. (4) The density
near a vortex scales as $r^2$ while the velocity goes as $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance to vortex.
(5) A vortex segment moves at a velocity inversely proportional to its curvature scale so that smaller
vortex rings move faster, allowing momentary motion exceeding escape velocity. We discuss observational/experimental
signatures from vortices and, more broadly, wave interference. In the ultra-light regime, gravitational
lensing by interference substructures leads to flux anomalies of $5-10 \%$ in strongly lensed systems.
For QCD axions, vortices lead to a diminished signal in some detection experiments but not in others.
We advocate the measurement of correlation functions by axion detection experiments as a way to
probe and capitalize on the expected interference substructures.
