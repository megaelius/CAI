The random matrix theory (RMT) can be used to classify both topological phases of matter and quantum
chaos. We develop a systematic and transformative RMT to classify the quantum chaos in the colored
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model first introduced by Gross and Rosenhaus. Here we focus on the 2-colored
case and 4-colored case with balanced number of Majorana fermion $N$. By identifying the maximal
symmetries, the independent parity conservation sectors, the minimum (irreducible) Hilbert
space, and especially the relevant anti-unitary and unitary operators, we show that the color degree
of freedoms lead to novel quantum chaotic behaviours. When $N$ is odd, different symmetry operators
need to be constructed to make the classifications complete. The 2-colored case only show 3-fold
Wigner-Dyson way, and the 4-colored case show 10-fold generalized Wigner-Dyson way which may also
have non-trivial edge exponents. We also study 2- and 4-colored hybrid SYK models which display
many salient quantum chaotic features hidden in the corresponding pure SYK models. These features
motivate us to develop a systematic RMT to study the energy level statistics of 2 or 4 un-correlated
random matrix ensembles. The exact diagonalizations are performed to study both the bulk energy
level statistics and the edge exponents and find excellent agreements with our exact maximal symmetry
classifications. Our complete and systematic methods can be easily extended to study the generic
imbalanced cases. They may be transferred to the classifications of colored tensor models, quantum
chromodynamics with pairings across different colors, quantum black holes and interacting symmetry
protected (or enriched) topological phases.
