We investigate six types of two-point boundary correlation functions in the dense loop model. These
are defined as ratios $Z/Z^0$ of partition functions on the $m\times n$ square lattice, with the
boundary condition for $Z$ depending on two points $x$ and $y$. We consider: the insertion of an isolated
defect (a) and a pair of defects (b) in a Dirichlet boundary condition, the transition (c) between
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, and the connectivity of clusters (d), loops (e) and
boundary segments (f) in a Neumann boundary condition. For the model of critical dense polymers,
corresponding to a vanishing loop weight ($\beta = 0$), we find determinant and pfaffian expressions
for these correlators. We extract the conformal weights of the underlying conformal fields and
find $\Delta = -\frac18$, $0$, $-\frac3{32}$, $\frac38$, $1$, $\tfrac \theta \pi (1+ \tfrac{2\theta}\pi)$,
where $\theta$ encodes the weight of one class of loops for the correlator of type f. These results
are obtained by analysing the asymptotics of the exact expressions, and by using the Cardy-Peschel
formula in the case where $x$ and $y$ are set to the corners. For type b, we find a $\ln|x-y|$ dependence
from the asymptotics, and a $\ln (\ln n)$ term in the corner free energy. This is consistent with the
interpretation of the boundary condition of type b as the insertion of a logarithmic field belonging
to a rank two Jordan cell. For the other values of $\beta = 2 \cos \lambda$, we use the hypothesis of
conformal invariance to predict the conformal weights and find $\Delta = \Delta_{1,2}$, $\Delta_{1,3}$,
$\Delta_{0,\frac12}$, $\Delta_{1,0}$, $\Delta_{1,-1}$ and $\Delta_{\frac{2\theta}\lambda+1,\frac{2\theta}\lambda+1}$,
extending the results of critical dense polymers. With the results for type f, we reproduce a Coulomb
gas prediction for the valence bond entanglement entropy of Jacobsen and Saleur.
