An entanglement measure for a bipartite quantum system is a state functional that vanishes on separable
states and that does not increase under separable (local) operations. It is well-known that for
pure states, essentially all entanglement measures are equal to the v. Neumann entropy of the reduced
state, but for mixed states, this uniqueness is lost. In quantum field theory, bipartite systems
are associated with causally disjoint regions. There are no separable (normal) states to begin
with when the regions touch each other, so one must leave a finite "safety-corridor". Due to this
corridor, the normal states of bipartite systems are necessarily mixed, and the v. Neumann entropy
is not a good entanglement measure in the above sense. In this paper, we study various entanglement
measures which vanish on separable states, do not increase under separable (local) operations,
and have other desirable properties. In particular, we study the relative entanglement entropy,
defined as the minimum relative entropy between the given state and an arbitrary separable state.
We establish rigorous upper and lower bounds in various quantum field theoretic (QFT) models, as
well as also model-independent ones. The former include free fields on static spacetime manifolds
in general dimensions, or integrable models with factorizing $S$-matrix in 1+1 dimensions. The
latter include bounds on ground states in general conformal QFTs, charged states (including charges
with braid-group statistics) or thermal states in theories satisfying a "nuclearity condition".
Typically, the bounds show a divergent behavior when the systems get close to each other--sometimes
of the form of a generalized "area law"--and decay when the systems are far apart. Our main technical
tools are of operator algebraic nature.
