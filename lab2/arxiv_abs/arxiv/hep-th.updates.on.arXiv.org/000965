Non-equilibrium thermodynamics of Onsager and Machlup and of Hashitsume is reformulated as a gravity
analog model, in which thermodynamic variables, kinetic coefficients and generalized forces
form, respectively, coordinates, metric tensor and vector fields in a space of thermodynamic variables.
The relevant symmetry of the model is the general coordinate transformation. Then, the entropy
production is classified into three categories, when a closed path is depicted as a thermodynamic
cycle. One category is time reversal odd, and is attributed to the number of lines of magnetic flux
passing through the closed path, having monopole as a source. There are two time reversal even categories,
one of which is attributed to the space curvature around the path, having gravitational instanton
as a source, which dominates for a rapid operation of the cycle. The last category is the usual one,
which remains even for the quasi-equilibrium operation. It is possible to extend the model to include
non-linear responses. In introducing new terms, important is the dimensional counting, using
two parameters, the temperature and the relaxation time. The effective action, being induced by
the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, is derived. This is a candidate for the action which controls
the dynamics of kinetic coefficients and thermodynamic forces. An example is given in a chemical
oscillatory reaction in a solvent of the van der Waals type. Fluctuation-dissipation theorem is
examined `a la Onsager, and a derivation of the gravity analog thermodynamic model from quantum
mechanics is sketched, based on an analogy to the resonance problem.
