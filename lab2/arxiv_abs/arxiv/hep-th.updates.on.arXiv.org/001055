The number of classical paths of a given length, connecting any two events in a (pseudo) Riemannian
spacetime is, of course, infinite. It is, however, possible to define a useful, finite, measure
$N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$ for the effective number of quantum paths [of length $\sigma$ connecting
two events $(x_1,x_2)$] in an arbitrary spacetime. When $x_2=x_1$, this reduces to $C(x,\sigma)$
giving the measure for closed quantum loops of length $\sigma$ containing an event $x$. Both $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$
and $C(x,\sigma)$ are well-defined and depend only on the geometry of the spacetime. Various other
physical quantities like, for e.g., the effective Lagrangian, can be expressed in terms of $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$.
The corresponding measure for the total path length contributed by the closed loops, in a spacetime
region $\mathcal{V}$, is given by the integral of $L(\sigma;x) \equiv\sigma C(\sigma;x)$ over
$\mathcal{V}$. Remarkably enough $L(0;x) \propto R(x)$, the Ricci scalar; i.e, the measure for
the total length contributed by infinitesimal closed loops in a region of spacetime gives us the
Einstein-Hilbert action. Its variation, when we vary the metric, can provide a new route towards
induced/emergent gravity descriptions. In the presence of a background electromagnetic field,
the corresponding expressions for $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$ and $C(x,\sigma)$ can be related to the
holonomies of the field. The measure $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$ can also be used to evaluate a wide class
of path integrals for which the action and the measure are arbitrary functions of the path length.
As an example, I compute a modified path integral which incorporates the zero-point-length in the
spacetime. I also describe several other properties of $N(x_2,x_1;\sigma)$ and outline a few simple
applications.
