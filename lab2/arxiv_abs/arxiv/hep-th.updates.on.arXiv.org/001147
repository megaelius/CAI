Finding effective theories of modified gravity that can resolve cosmological singularities and
avoid other physical pathologies such as ghost and gradient instabilities has turned out to be a
rather difficult task. The concept of limiting curvature, where one bounds a finite number of curvature-invariant
functions thanks to constraint equations, is a promising avenue in that direction, but its implementation
has only led to mixed results. Cuscuton gravity, which can be defined as a special subclass of $k$-essence
theory for instance, is a minimal modification of gravity since it does not introduce any new degrees
of freedom on a cosmological background. Importantly, it naturally incorporates the idea of limiting
curvature. Accordingly, models of cuscuton gravity are shown to possess non-singular cosmological
solutions and those appear stable at first sight. Yet, various subtleties arise in the perturbations
such as apparent divergences, e.g., when the Hubble parameter crosses zero. We revisit the cosmological
perturbations in various gauges and demonstrate that the stability results are robust even at those
crossing points, although certain gauges are better suited to analyze the perturbations. In particular,
the spatially-flat gauge is found to be ill defined when $H=0$. Otherwise, the sound speed is confirmed
to be generally close to unity in the ultraviolet, and curvature perturbations are shown to remain
essentially constant in the infrared throughout a bounce phase. Perturbations for a model of extended
cuscuton (as a subclass of Horndeski theory) are also studied and similar conclusions are recovered.
