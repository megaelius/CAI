This is the second part of the project `unified theory of classical orthogonal polynomials of a discrete
variable derived from the eigenvalue problems of hermitian matrices.' In a previous paper, orthogonal
polynomials having Jackson integral measures were not included, since such measures cannot be
obtained from single infinite dimensional hermitian matrices. Here we show that Jackson integral
measures for the polynomials of the big $q$-Jacobi family are the consequence of the recovery of
self-adjointness of the unbounded Jacobi matrices governing the difference equations of these
polynomials. The recovery of self-adjointness is achieved in an extended $\ell^2$ Hilbert space
on which a direct sum of two unbounded Jacobi matrices acts as a Hamiltonian or a difference Schr\"odinger
operator for an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem. The polynomial appearing in the upper/lower
end of Jackson integral constitutes the eigenvector of each of the two unbounded Jacobi matrix of
the direct sum. We also point out that the orthogonal vectors involving the $q$-Meixner ($q$-Charlier)
polynomials do not form a complete basis of the $\ell^2$ Hilbert space, based on the fact that the
dual $q$-Meixner polynomials introduced in a previous paper fail to satisfy the orthogonality
relation. The complete set of eigenvectors involving the $q$-Meixner polynomials is obtained
by constructing the duals of the dual $q$-Meixner polynomials which require the two component Hamiltonian
formulation. An alternative solution method based on the closure relation, the Heisenberg operator
solution, is applied to the polynomials of the big $q$-Jacobi family and their duals and $q$-Meixner
($q$-Charlier) polynomials.
