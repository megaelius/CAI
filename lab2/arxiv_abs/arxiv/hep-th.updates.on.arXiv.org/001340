The four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory exhibits rich dynamics in
the presence of codimension-one conformal defects. The new structure constants of the extended
operator algebra consist of one-point functions of local operators which are nonvanishing due
to the defect insertion and carry nontrivial coupling dependence. We study an important class of
half-BPS superconformal defects engineered by D5 branes that share three common directions with
the D3 branes and involve Nahm pole configurations for the SYM fields on the D3 brane worldvolume.
In the planar large $N$ limit, we obtain non-perturbative results in the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$
for the defect one-point functions of both BPS and non-BPS operators, building upon recent progress
in localization and integrability methods. For BPS operator insertions in the SYM with D5-brane
type boundary or interface, we derive an effective two dimensional defect-Yang-Mills (dYM) theory
from supersymmetric localization, which gives an efficient way to extract defect observables
and generates a novel matrix model for the defect one-point function. By solving the matrix model
in the large $N$ limit, we obtain exact results in $\lambda$ which interpolate between perturbative
Feynman diagram contributions in the weak coupling limit and IIB string theory predictions on $AdS_5\times
S^5$ in the strong coupling regime, providing a precision test of AdS/CFT with interface defects.
For general non-BPS operators, we develop a non-perturbative bootstrap-type program for integrable
boundary states on the worldsheet of the IIB string theory, corresponding to the interface defects
in the planar SYM. Such integrable boundary states are constrained by a set of general consistency
conditions for which we present explicit solutions that reproduce and extend the known results
at weak coupling from integrable spin-chain methods.
