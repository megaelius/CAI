We compute how an accelerating qubit coupled to a scalar field - i.e. an Unruh-DeWitt detector - evolves
in flat space, with an emphasis on its late-time behaviour. When calculable, the qubit evolves towards
a thermal state for a field prepared in the Minkowski vacuum, with the approach to this limit controlled
by two different time-scales. For a free field we compute both of these as functions of the difference
between qubit energy levels, the dimensionless qubit/field coupling constant, the scalar field
mass and the qubit's proper acceleration. Both time-scales differ from the Candelas-Deutsch-Sciama
transition rate traditionally computed for Unruh-DeWitt detectors, which we show describes the
qubit's early-time evolution away from the vacuum rather than its late-time approach to equilibrium.
For small enough couplings and sufficiently late times the evolution is Markovian and described
by a Lindblad equation, which we derive in detail from first principles as a special instance of Open
EFT methods designed to handle a breakdown of late-time perturbative predictions due to the presence
of secular growth. We show how this growth is resummed in this example to give reliable information
about late-time evolution including both qubit/field interactions and field self-interactions.
By allowing very explicit treatment, the qubit/field system allows a systematic assessment of
the approximations needed when exploring late-time evolution, in a way that lends itself to gravitational
applications. It also allows a comparison of these approximations with those - e.g. the `rotating-wave'
approximation - widely made in the open-system literature (which is aimed more at atomic transitions
and lasers).
