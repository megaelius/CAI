We introduce a -- somewhat holographic -- dictionary between gravitational observables for scattering
processes (measured at "the boundary") and adiabatic invariants for bound orbits (in "the bulk"),
to all orders in the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. Our map relies on remarkable connections
between the relative momentum of the two-body problem, the classical limit of the scattering amplitude
and the deflection angle in hyperbolic motion. These relationships allow us to construct observables
for closed orbits from the unbound case through analytic continuation. A simplified (more geometrical)
map can be obtained for circular orbits, enabling us to extract the orbital frequency as a function
of the (conserved) binding energy, $\Omega(E)$, from scattering data. As an example, using the
two-loop amplitude in Bern et al. [hep-th/1901.04424, hep-th/1908.01493], we readily derive
an expression for $\Omega(E)$ to 3PM, to all orders in velocity. We also provide a closed expression
for the orbital frequency to 1PM, which captures a series of exact terms in the Post-Newtonian expansion.
We then perform a partial PM resummation, using a "no-recoil" approximation for the amplitude.
This limit is behind the map between the scattering angle for a test-particle and the two-body dynamics
to 2PM. We show that it also captures a subset of higher order terms beyond the test-particle limit.
While a (rather lengthy) Hamiltonian may be derived as an intermediate step, our map applies directly
between gauge invariant quantities. Our findings provide a starting point for an alternative approach
to the binary inspiral problem. We conclude with future directions and some speculations on the
classical double copy.
