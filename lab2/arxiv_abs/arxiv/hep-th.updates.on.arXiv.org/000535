We perform systematical investigation of all possible regimes in spatially flat vacuum cosmological
model in cubic Lovelock gravity. We consider the spatial section to be a product of three- and extra-dimensional
isotropic subspaces, with the former considered to be our Universe. As the equations of motion are
different for D=3, 4, 5 and general $D \geqslant 6$ cases, we considered them separately. For each
D we found values for $\alpha$ (Gauss-Bonnet coupling) and $\beta$ (cubic Lovelock coupling) which
separate different dynamical cases and study the dynamics in each region to find all possible regimes
for all possible initial conditions and any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The results suggest
that in all $D \geqslant 3$ there are regimes with compactification originating from so-called
"generalized Taub" solution. The endpoint of these regimes is either anisotropic exponential
(for $\alpha > 0$, $\mu \equiv \beta/\alpha^2 < \mu_1$ (including entire $\beta < 0$)) or standard
Kasner solution (for $\alpha > 0$, $\mu > \mu_1$). For $D \geqslant 8$ there is additional regime
which originates from high-energy (cubic Lovelock) Kasner and ends as anisotropic exponential
solution. It exists in two domains: $\alpha > 0$, $\beta < 0$, $\mu \leqslant \mu_4$ and entire $\alpha
> 0$, $\beta > 0$. So that for $D \geqslant 8$ and $\alpha > 0$, $\beta < 0$, $\mu < \mu_4$ there are two
realistic compactification regimes with two different anisotropic exponential solutions as
future asymptotes. For $D \geqslant 8$ and $\alpha > 0$, $\beta > 0$, $\mu < \mu_2$ there are two realistic
compactification regimes but they lead to the same anisotropic exponential solution. There are
two unexpected observations among the results -- all realistic compactification regimes exist
only for $\alpha > 0$ and there is no smooth transition between high-energy and low-energy Kasner
regimes.
