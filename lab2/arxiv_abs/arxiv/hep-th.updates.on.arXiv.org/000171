The recent detection of the cosmic microwave background polarimeter experiment BICEP2 of tensor
fluctuations in the B-mode power spectrum basically excludes all plausible axion models where
its decay constant is above $10^{13}$ GeV. Moreover, there are strong theoretical, astrophysical,
and cosmological motivations for models involving, in addition to the axion, also axion-like particles
(ALPs), with decay constants in the intermediate scale range, between $10^9$ GeV and $10^{13}$
GeV. Here, we present a general analysis of models with an axion and further ALPs and derive bounds
on the relative size of the axion and ALP photon (and electron) coupling. We discuss what we can learn
from measurements of the axion and ALP photon couplings about the fundamental parameters of the
underlying ultraviolet completion of the theory. For the latter we consider extensions of the Standard
Model in which the axion and the ALP(s) appear as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the breaking
of global chiral $U(1)$ (Peccei-Quinn (PQ)) symmetries, occuring accidentally as low energy remnants
from exact discrete symmetries. In such models, the axion and the further ALP are protected from
disastrous explicit symmetry breaking effects due to Planck-scale suppressed operators. The
scenarios considered exploit heavy right handed neutrinos getting their mass via PQ symmetry breaking
and thus explain the small mass of the active neutrinos via a seesaw relation between the electroweak
and an intermediate PQ symmetry breaking scale. We show some models that can accommodate simultaneously
an axion dark matter candidate, an ALP explaining the anomalous transparency of the universe for
$\gamma$-rays, and an ALP explaining the recently reported 3.55 keV gamma line from galaxies and
clusters of galaxies, if the respective decay constants are of intermediate scale.
