We study three types of the old-minimal higher-derivative supergravity theories extending the
f(R) gravity, towards their use for the inflationary model building in supergravity, by using both
superfields and their field components. In the curved superspace all those theories are described
in terms of a single chiral scalar curvature superfeld \mc{R}. Each of those theories can be dualized
into a matter-coupled supergravity without higher derivatives. The first type is parametrized
by a single non-holomorphic potential N(\mc{R},\bar{\mc{R}}), and gives rise to the dual matter-coupled
supergravities with two dynamical chiral matter superfields having a no-scale K"ahler potential.
We find that a generic potential N(\mc{R},\bar{\mc{R}}) generates both the (R+R^2) gravity and
the non-minimal coupling of the propagating complex scalar field to the R, needed for the Starobinsky
and Higgs inflation, respectively. We find the general conditions for the Starobinsky inflation
and compute the inflaton mass. The second type is given by the chiral supergravity actions whose
superfield Lagrangian F(\mc{R},\Sigma({\bar{\mc R}})) also depends upon the chiral projection
\Sigma of the anti-chiral superfield {\bar{\mc R}}. We find the condition for their ghost freedom.
We also revisit the F(\mc{R}) supergravity actions of the third type (without the \Sigma-dependence)
with the reduced number of the extra physical degrees of freedom, comprising a single chiral matter
superfeld with a no-scale K"ahler potential. We find that the known no-go arguments in the recent
literature are insufficient to rule out the F(\mc{R}) models of inflation. However, the class of
the scalar potentials supported by the F(\mc{R}) supergravity appears to be too restrictive for
viable inflationary scenarios at all values of R.
