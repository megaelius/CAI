BRST-BFV method for constrained Lagrangian formulations for (ir)reducible half-integer HS Poincare
group representations in Minkowski space is suggested. The procedure is derived by 2 ways: from
the unconstrained BRST-BFV method for mixed-symmetry HS fermionic fields subject to an arbitrary
Young tableaux with k rows (suggested in arXiv:1211.1273[hep-th]) by extracting the second-class
constraints, $\widehat{O}_\alpha=(\widehat{O}_a, \widehat{O}^+_a)$, from a total superalgebra
of constraints, second, in self-consistent way by means of finding BRST-extended initial off-shell
algebraic constraints, $\widehat{O}_a$. In both cases, the latter constraints supercommute
on the constraint surface with constrained BRST $Q_C$ and spin operators $\sigma^i_C$. The closedness
of the superalgebra $Q_C, \widehat{O}_a, \sigma^i_C$ guarantees that the final gauge-invariant
Lagrangian formulation is compatible with off-shell constraints $\widehat{O}_a$ imposed on
field and gauge parameter vectors of Hilbert space not depending from the ghosts and conversion
auxiliary oscillators related to $\widehat{O}_a$, in comparison with vectors for unconstrained
BRST-BFV Lagrangian formulation. The suggested constrained BRST-BFV approach is valid for both
massive HS fields and integer HS fields in the second-order formulation. It is shown that the respective
constrained and unconstrained Lagrangian formulations for (half)-integer HS fields with a given
spin are equivalent. The constrained Lagrangians in ghost-independent and component (for initial
spin-tensor field) are obtained and shown to coincide with Fang-Fronsdal formulation for constrained
totally-symmetric HS field. The triplet and unconstrained quartet Lagrangian formulations for
the latter field are derived. A concept of BRST-invariant second-class constraints for a general
dynamical system with mixed-class constraints is suggested.
