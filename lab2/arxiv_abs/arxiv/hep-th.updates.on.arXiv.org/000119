Recently, the one-loop free energy of higher spin (HS) theories in Euclidean AdS_{d+1} was calculated
and matched with the order N^0 term in the free energy of the large N ``vectorial" scalar CFT on the
S^d boundary. Here we extend this matching to the boundary theory defined on S^1 x S^{d-1}, where
the length of S^1 may be interpreted as the inverse temperature. It has been shown that the large N
limit of the partition function on S^1 x S^2 in the U(N) singlet sector of the CFT of N free complex scalars
matches the one-loop thermal partition function of the Vasiliev theory in AdS_4, while in the O(N)
singlet sector of the CFT of N real scalars it matches the minimal theory containing even spins only.
We extend this matching to all dimensions d. We also calculate partition functions for the singlet
sectors of free fermion CFT's in various dimensions and match them with appropriately defined higher
spin theories, which for d>3 contain massless gauge fields with mixed symmetry. In the zero-temperature
case R x S^{d-1} we calculate the Casimir energy in the scalar or fermionic CFT and match it with the
one-loop correction in the global AdS_{d+1}. For any odd-dimensional CFT the Casimir energy must
vanish on general grounds, and we show that the HS duals obey this. In the U(N) symmetric case, we exhibit
the vanishing of the regularized 1-loop Casimir energy of the dual HS theory in AdS_{d+1}. In the
minimal HS theory the vacuum energy vanishes for odd d while for even d it is equal to the Casimir energy
of a single conformal scalar in R x S^{d-1} which is again consistent with AdS/CFT, provided the minimal
HS coupling constant is ~ 1/(N-1). We demonstrate analogous results for singlet sectors of theories
of N Dirac or Majorana fermions. We also discuss extensions to CFT's containing N_f flavors in the
fundamental representation of U(N) or O(N).
