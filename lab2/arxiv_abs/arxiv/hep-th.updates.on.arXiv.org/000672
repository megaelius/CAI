Though not a part of mainstream physics, Salam's theory of strong gravity remains a viable effective
model for the description of strong interactions in the gauge singlet sector of QCD, capable of producing
particle confinement and asymptotic freedom, but not of reproducing interactions involving $SU(3)$
colour charge. It may therefore be used to explore the stability and confinement of gauge singlet
hadrons, though not to describe scattering processes that require colour interactions. It is a
two-tensor theory of both strong interactions and gravity, in which the strong tensor field is governed
by equations formally identical to the Einstein equations, apart from the coupling parameter,
which is of order $1 \ \rm GeV^{-1}$. We revisit the strong gravity theory and investigate the strong
gravity field equations in the presence of a mixing term which induces an effective {\it strong cosmological
constant}, $\Lambda_{f}$. This introduces a {\it strong de Sitter radius} for strongly interacting
fermions, producing a confining bubble, which allows us to identify $\Lambda_{f}$ with the `bag
constant' of the MIT bag model, $B \simeq 2 \times 10^{14} \rm gcm^{-3}$. Assuming a static, spherically
symmetric geometry, we derive the strong gravity TOV equation, which describes the equilibrium
properties of compact hadronic objects. From this, we determine the generalised Buchdahl inequalities
for a strong gravity `particle', giving rise to upper and lower bounds on the mass/radius ratio of
stable, compact, strongly interacting objects. We show, explicitly, that the existence of the
lower mass bound is induced by the presence of $\Lambda_f$, producing a mass gap, and that the upper
bound corresponds to a deconfinement phase transition. The physical implications of our results
for holographic duality in the context of the AdS/QCD and dS/QCD correspondences are also discussed.
