We show that a nontrivial topologies of the spatial section of Minkowski space-time allow for motion
of a charged particle under quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. This is a
potentially observable effect of these vacuum fluctuations. We derive mean squared velocity dispersion
when the charged particle lies in Minkowski space-time with compact spatial sections in one, two
and/or three directions. We concretely examine the details of these stochastic motions when the
spatial section is endowed with different globally homogeneous and inhomogeneous topologies.
We also show that compactification in just one direction of the spatial section of Minkowski space-time
is sufficient to give rise to velocity dispersion components in the compact and noncompact directions.
The question as to whether these stochastic motions under vacuum fluctuations can locally be used
to unveil global (topological) homogeneity and inhomogeneity is discussed. In globally homogeneous
space topologically induced velocity dispersion of a charged particle is the same regardless of
the particle's position, whereas in globally inhomogeneous the time-evolution of the velocity
depends on the particle's position. Finally, by using the Minkowskian topological limit of globally
homogeneous spaces we show that the greater is the value of the compact topological length the longer
is the time interval within which the velocity dispersion of a charged particle is negligible. This
means that no motion of a charged particle under electromagnetic quantum fluctuations is allowed
when Minkowski space-time is endowed with the simply-connected spatial topology. The ultimate
ground for such stochastic motion of charged particle under electromagnetic quantum vacuum fluctuations
is a nontrivial space topology.
