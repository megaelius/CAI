A distance can be measured by monitoring how much a wheel has rotated when rolled without slipping.
This simple idea underlies the mathematics of Cartan geometry. The Cartan-geometric description
of gravity consists of a SO(1,4) gauge connection $A^{AB}(x)$ and a symmetry-breaking field $V^A(x)$.
The clear similarity with symmetry-broken Yang-Mills theory suggests strongly the existence
of a new field in nature: the gravitational Higgs field $V^A$. By treating $V^A$ as a genuine dynamical
field we arrive at a natural generalization of General Relativity with a wealth of new phenomenology
and with General Relativity reproduced exactly in the limit where $V^2$ tends to a positive constant.
We show that in regions wherein $V^2(x)$ varies, but has a definite sign, the Cartan-geometric formulation
is a form of a scalar-tensor theory. A specific choice of action yields the Peebles-Ratra quintessence
model whilst more general actions are shown to exhibit propagation of torsion. Regions where the
sign of $V^2$ changes correspond to a change in signature of the geometry; a simple choice of action
with FRW symmetry yields, without any additional ad hoc assumptions, a classical analogue of the
Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal. Solutions from more general actions are discussed. A gauge
prescription for coupling matter to gravity is described and matter actions are presented which
reduce to standard ones in the limit $V^2\rightarrow const$. It becomes clear that Cartan geometry
may function as a novel platform for inspiring and exploring modified theories of gravity with applications
to dark energy, black holes, and early-universe cosmology. We end by listing a set of open problems.
