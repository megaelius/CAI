The problem on mapping between two Lagrangian descriptions (using a commuting c-number spinor
$\psi_{\alpha}$ or anticommuting pseudovector $\xi_{\mu}$ and pseudoscalar $\xi_5$ variables)
of the spin degrees of freedom of a color spinning massive particle interacting with background
non-Abelian gauge and fermion fields, is considered. A general analysis of the mapping between
a pair of Majorana spinors $(\psi_{\alpha}, \theta_{\alpha})$ ($\theta_{\alpha}$ is some auxiliary
anticommuting spinor) and a real anticommuting tensor system, is presented. A complete system
of bilinear relations between the tensor quantities, is obtained. This general analysis was used
for the above problem of the equivalence of two different ways of describing the spin degrees of freedom
of the relativistic particle. The mapping of the kinetic term and of the interaction term with an
external non-Abelian gauge field, are considered in detail. In the former case a corresponding
system of bilinear identities including both the tensor variables and their derivatives, is defined.
The exact solution of a system of bilinear identities for the case of Grassmann-odd tensors, is obtained.
The solution was used in constructing the mapping of the interaction terms of spinning particle
with a background (Majorana) fermion field. A way of the extension of the obtained results in the
case when the spinors $\psi_{\alpha}$ and $\theta_{\alpha}$ are Dirac ones, is suggested. It is
shown that for the construction of one-to-one correspondence between the most general spinors
and tensor variables, it is necessary a four-fold increase of the number of the tensor ones. The approach
of obtaining an supersymmetric Lagrangian in terms of the even $\psi_{\alpha}$ and odd $\theta_{\alpha}$
spinors, is offered. A connection with the higher-order derivative Lagrangians for a point particle,
is proposed.
