Heavy vector mesons detected after a heavy ion collision are important sources of information about
the quark gluon plasma. The fraction of such particles that survive the plasma phase and reach the
detectors is related to the dissociation degree inside the thermal medium. A consistent picture
for the thermal behavior of charmonium and bottomonium quasi-states in a thermal medium was obtained
recently using a holographic bottom up model. This model captures the heavy flavour spectroscopy
of masses and decay constants in the vacuum (zero temperature) and is consistently extended to finite
temperature. The spectral functions that emerge provide a description of the dissociation process
in terms of the broadening of the quasi-state peaks with temperature. The holographic approach
makes it possible to determine also the quasinormal modes. They are gravity solutions representing
the quasi-particle states in the thermal medium, with complex frequencies related to the thermal
mass and width. The quasinormal modes for charmonium and bottomonium have been studied very recently
and a consistent description of the dissociation process was found. An additional factor can affect
the dissociation process: strong magnetic fields are expected to be present when the plasma is formed
by non-central heavy ion collisions. So, it is important to understand the effect of such fields
on the heavy meson dissociation scenario. Here we extend the holographic determination of quasinormal
modes for the case when magnetic fields are present. The real and imaginary parts of the mode frequencies
are determined for different values of background $e B$ field. The associated dispersion relations
for heavy quarks moving inside the plasma are also investigated for both $ c \bar c$ and $ b \bar b \,
$.
