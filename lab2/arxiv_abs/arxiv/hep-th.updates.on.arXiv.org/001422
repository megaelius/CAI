In this thesis, we study aspects of entanglement theory of quantum field theories from an algebraic
point of view. The main motivation is to gain insights about the general structure of the entanglement
in QFT, towards a definition of an entropic version of QFT. In the opposite direction, we are also
interested in exploring any consequence of the entanglement in algebraic QFT. This may help us to
reveal unknown features of QFT, with the final aim of finding a dynamical principle which allows
us to construct non-trivial and rigorous models of QFT. The algebraic approach is the natural framework
to define and study entanglement in QFT, and hence, to pose the above inquiries. After a self-contained
review of algebraic QFT and quantum information theory in operator algebras, we focus on our results.
We compute, in a mathematically rigorous way, exact solutions of entanglement measures and modular
Hamiltonians for specific QFT models, using algebraic tools from modular theory of von Neumann
algebras. These calculations show explicitly non-local features of modular Hamiltonians and
help us to solve ambiguities that arise in other non-rigorous computations. We also study aspects
of entanglement entropy in theories having superselection sectors coming from global symmetries.
We follow the algebraic perspective of Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts. In this way, we find an entropic
order parameter that "measures" the size of the symmetry group, which is made out of a difference
of two mutual informations. Moreover, we identify the main operators that take account of such a
difference, and we obtain a new quantum information quantity, the entropic certainty relation,
involving algebras containing such operators. This certainty relation keeps an intrinsic connection
with subfactor theory of von Neumann algebras.
