In the framework of effective field theories with prominent helicity-0 and helicity-1 fields coupled
to each other via a dimension-3 operator, we study the dynamics of inflation driven by the helicity-0
mode, with a given potential energy, as well as the evolution of cosmological perturbations, influenced
by the presence of a mixing term between both helicities. In this scenario, the temporal component
of the helicity-1 mode is an auxiliary field and can be integrated out in terms of the time derivative
of the helicity-0 mode, so that the background dynamics effectively reduces to that in single-field
inflation modulated by a parameter $\beta$ associated to the coupling between helicity-0 and helicity-1
modes. We discuss the evolution of a longitudinal scalar perturbation $\psi$ and an inflaton fluctuation
$\delta \phi$, and explicitly show that a particular combination of these two, which corresponds
to an isocurvature mode, is subject to exponential suppression by the vector mass comparable to
the Hubble expansion rate during inflation. Furthermore, we find that the effective single-field
description corrected by $\beta$ also holds for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations
generated during inflation. We compute the standard inflationary observables such as the scalar
spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and confront several inflaton potentials
with the recent observational data provided by Planck 2018. Our results show that the coupling between
helicity-0 and helicity-1 modes can lead to a smaller value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio especially
for small-field inflationary models, so our scenario exhibits even better compatibility with
the current observational data.
