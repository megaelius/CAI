We extend the study of the two-dimensional euclidean $\phi^4$ theory initiated in ref.~\cite{Serone:2018gjo}
to the $\mathbb Z_2$ broken phase. In particular, we compute in perturbation theory up to N$^4$LO
in the quartic coupling the vacuum energy, the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$ and the mass gap
of the theory. We determine the large order behavior of the perturbative series by finding the leading
order finite action complex instanton configuration in the $\mathbb Z_2$ broken phase. Using an
appropriate conformal mapping, we then Borel resum the perturbative series. Interestingly enough,
the truncated perturbative series for the vacuum energy and the vacuum expectation value of the
field is reliable up to the critical coupling where a second order phase transition occurs, and breaks
down around the transition for the mass gap. We compute the vacuum energy using also an alternative
perturbative series, dubbed exact perturbation theory, that allows us to effectively reach N$^8$LO
in the quartic coupling. In this way we can access the strong coupling region of the $\mathbb Z_2$
broken phase and test Chang duality by comparing the vacuum energies computed in three different
descriptions of the same physical system. This result can also be considered as a confirmation of
the Borel summability of the theory. Our results are in very good agreement (and with comparable
or better precision) with those obtained by Hamiltonian truncation methods. We also discuss some
subtleties related to the physical interpretation of the mass gap and provide evidence that the
kink mass can be obtained by analytic continuation from the unbroken to the broken phase.
