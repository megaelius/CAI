We give a general, direct and explicit construction of lower-bounded generalized twisted modules
satisfying a universal property for a grading-restricted vertex (super)algebra $V$ associated
to an automorphism $g$ of $V$. In particular, when $g$ is the identity, we obtain lower-bounded generalized
$V$-modules satisfying a universal property. Let $W$ be a lower-bounded graded vector space equipped
with a set of "generating twisted fields" and a set of "generator twist fields" satisfying a weak
commutativity for generating twisted fields, a generalized weak commutativity for one generating
twisted field and one generator twist field and some other properties that are relatively easy to
verify. We first prove the convergence and commutativity of products of an arbitrary number of generating
twisted fields, one twist generator field and an arbitrary number of generating fields for $V$.
Then using the convergence and commutativity, we define a twisted vertex operator map for $W$ and
prove that $W$ equipped with this twisted vertex operator map is a lower-bounded generalized $g$-twisted
$V$-module. Using this result, we give an explicit construction of lower-bounded generalized
$g$-twisted $V$-modules satisfying a universal property starting from vector spaces graded by
weights, $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-fermion numbers and $g$-weights (eigenvalues of $g$) and real numbers
corresponding to the lower bounds of the weights of the modules to be constructed. In particular,
every lower-bounded generalized $g$-twisted $V$-module (every lower-bounded generalized $V$-module
when $g$ is the identity) is a quotient of such a universal lower-bounded generalized $g$-twisted
$V$-module (a universal lower-bounded generalized $V$-module).
