Applying the Born-Infeld Anti de Sitter charged black hole metric in presence of its Hawking temperature
corrections we calculate holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) by regarding proposal of Ryu
and Takanayagi. To do so we assume that time dependence of the black hole mass and charge to be as step
function. Our work is restricted to small subregions where a collapsing null shell dose not cross
the black holes horizon. To calculate time dependent HEE of the black hole we use perturbation method
and obtain convergent series solutions. We choose two shape functions for the holographic screen.
They are strip and disc which are made from shadow of collapsing half-cylinder and half-sphere null
shell on the boundary. There is a saturation time where the HEE reaches to its maximum value while
its velocity vanishes again after rasing to take a maximum value. In fact there is a critical time
less than the saturation time where the time dependent HEE is divided into an accelerating and a decelerating
phase. In case of strip (disc) the black hole mass (charge) plays central role for numerical values
of the saturation time. In general, this work satisfies result of the works presented by Camelio
et al and Zeng et al. We must point out that they used equal time two-point correlation functions and
Wilson loops instead of the entanglement entropy (EE) as non-local observable to study the black
hole thermalization by applying the numerical method. This work presents causality breaking just
for the disc state with strong limits of the Born Infeld nonlinear electromagnetic field where maximum
velocity of the HEE is exceeded from the light speed.
