Recently, the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) has been gaining attention to generate primordial
magnetic fields in the Universe and also to resolve singularity problems. Moreover, recent works
have shown the crucial role of the NED on the inflation. This paper provides a new approach based on
a new model of NED as a source of gravitation to remove the cosmic singularity at the big bang and explain
the cosmic acceleration during the inflation era on the background of stochastic magnetic field.
We explore whether a NED field can be the origin of the cosmic acceleration. Also, we found a realization
of a cyclic Universe, free of initial singularity, due the model for the NED energy density we propose.
We find explicit relations for $H(z)$ and perform a MCMC analysis to constrain the NED parameters
by using Observational Hubble data (OHD) obtained from differential age (DA) method, which contains
$31$ data points covering $0 < z < 1.97$; and with the latest SNIa data, that is, the joint-light-analysis
(JLA) compilation consisting in $740$ data points in the range $0.01<z<1.2$. We compute the deceleration
parameter $q(z)$ in the range $0<z<2$ from the best fit values of the parameters found using OHD and
SNIa data and find that $q(z)\rightarrow1/2$ when $z\rightarrow \infty$. In addition, both cosmological
data predict an accelerating expansion, i.e., the Universe passes of a decelerated phase to an accelerated
stage at redshift $\sim 0.5$ and $\sim 0.7$ for the OHD and SNIa constraints respectively. The result
is that there are not statistical differences with the usual model during the radiation epoch which
holds for $\alpha=0$. However, taking $\alpha$ slightly different from zero, we find that the NED
with dust matter ($w_{m}=0$) is able to drive the late-time cosmic acceleration of the standard
cosmological model.
