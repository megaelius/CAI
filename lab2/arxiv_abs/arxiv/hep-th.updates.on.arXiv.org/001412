Primordial cosmological perturbations are the seeds that were cultivated by inflation and the
succeeding dynamical processes, eventually leading to the current Universe. In this work, we investigate
the behaviour of the gauge-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations under the general extended
disformal transformation, namely, $g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow A(X,Y,Z)g_{\mu\nu} + \Phi_\mu\Phi_\nu$,
where $X \equiv -\tfrac{1}{2}\phi^{;\mu}\phi_{;\mu}, Y \equiv \phi^{;\mu}X_{;\mu}, Z \equiv
X^{;\mu}X_{;\mu} $ and $\Phi_\mu \equiv C\phi_{;\mu} + DX_{;\mu}$, with $C$ and $D$ being a general
functional of $(\phi,X,Y,Z)$. We find that the tensor perturbation is invariant under this transformation.
On the other hand, the scalar curvature perturbation receives a correction due the conformal term
only; it is independent of the disformal term at least up to linear order. Within the framework of
the full Horndeski theory, the correction terms turn out to depend linearly on the gauge-invariant
comoving density perturbation and the first time-derivative thereof. In the superhorizon limit,
all these correction terms vanish, leaving only the original scalar curvature perturbation. In
other words, it is invariant under the general extended disformal transformation in the superhorizon
limit, in the context of full Horndeski theory. Our work encompasses a chain of research studies
on the transformation or invariance of the primordial cosmological perturbations, generalising
their results under our general extended disformal transformation. Apart from the cosmological
perturbations, this work and the transformation considered herein, give us strong impetus to go
beyond the current horizon of scalar-tensor theories.
