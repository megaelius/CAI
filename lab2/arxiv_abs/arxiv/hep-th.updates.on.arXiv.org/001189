Varying the gravitational Lagrangian produces a boundary contribution that has various physical
applications. It determines the right boundary terms to be added to the action once boundary conditions
are specified, and defines the symplectic structure of covariant phase space methods. We study
general boundary variations using tetrads instead of the metric. This choice streamlines many
calculations, especially in the case of null hypersurfaces with arbitrary coordinates, where
we show that the spin-1 momentum coincides with the rotational 1-form of isolated horizons. The
additional gauge symmetry of internal Lorentz transformations leaves however an imprint: the
boundary variation differs from the metric one by an exact 3-form. This difference helps in the variational
principle: gluing hypersurfaces to determine the action boundary terms for given boundary conditions
is simpler, including the most general case of non-orthogonal corners. On the other hand, this difference
affects the construction of Hamiltonian surface charges with covariant phase space methods, which
end up being generically different from the metric ones. They can be made equal to the metric ones
only in the case of isometries, by either gauge-fixing the tetrad to be adapted to the hypersurface,
or introducing a fine-tuned internal Lorentz transformation depending non-linearly on the fields.
We point out and explore the alternative approach of dressing the bare symplectic potential to recover
the value of all metric charges, and not just for isometries. Surface charges can also be constructed
using a cohomological prescription: in this case we find that the exact 3-form mismatch plays no
role, and tetrad and metric charges are equal. This prescription leads however to different charges
whether one uses a first-order or second-order Lagrangian, and only for isometries one recovers
the same charges.
