We advocate for an alternative description of gravitational radiation from black holes based on
complex angular momentum techniques (analytic continuation of partial wave expansions, duality
of the ${\cal S}$-matrix and effective resummations involving its Regge poles and the associated
residues, Regge trajectories, semiclassical interpretations \dots). Such techniques, which
proved to be very helpful in various areas of physics to describe and analyze resonant scattering,
were only marginally used in the context of black hole physics. Here, by considering the multipolar
waveform generated by a massive particle falling radially from infinity into a Schwarzschild black
hole, we show that they could play a fundamental role in gravitational-wave physics. More precisely,
from the multipole expansion defining the Weyl scalar $\Psi_4$, we extract the Fourier transform
of a sum over Regge poles and their residues which can be evaluated numerically from the associated
Regge trajectories. This Regge pole approximation permits us to reconstruct, for an arbitrary
direction of observation, a large part of the multipolar waveform $\Psi_4$. In particular, it can
reproduce with a very good agreement the quasinormal ringdown as well as with a rather good agreement
the tail of the signal. This is achieved even if we take into account only one Regge pole and, if a large
number of modes are excited, the result can be improved by considering additional poles. Moreover,
while quasinormal-mode contributions do not provide physically relevant results at `early times'
due to their exponentially divergent behavior as time decreases, it is not necessary to determine
from physical considerations a starting time for the Regge ringdown.
