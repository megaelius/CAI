The topological $p$-wave pairing of composite fermions, believed to be responsible for the 5/2
fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), has generated much exciting physics. Motivated by the parton
theory of the FQHE, we consider the possibility of a new kind of emergent "superconductivity" in
the 1/3 FQHE, which involves condensation of clusters of $n$ composite bosons. From a microscopic
perspective, the state is described by the $n\bar{n}111$ parton wave function ${\cal P}_{\rm LLL}
\Phi_n\Phi_n^*\Phi_1^3$, where $\Phi_n$ is the wave function of the integer quantum Hall state
with $n$ filled Landau levels and ${\cal P}_{\rm LLL}$ is the lowest-Landau-level projection operator.
It represents a $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ superconductor of composite bosons, because the factor $\Phi_1^3\sim
\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)^3$, where $z_j=x_j-iy_j$ is the coordinate of the $j$th electron, binds
three vortices to electrons to convert them into composite bosons, which then condense into the
$\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ superconducting state $|\Phi_n|^2$. From a field theoretical perspective,
this state can be understood by starting with the usual Laughlin theory and gauging a $\mathbb{Z}_n$
subgroup of the $U(1)$ charge conservation symmetry. We find from detailed quantitative calculations
that the $2\bar{2}111$ and $3\bar{3}111$ states are at least as plausible as the Laughlin wave function
for the exact Coulomb ground state at filling $\nu=7/3$, suggesting that this physics is possibly
relevant for the 7/3 FQHE. The $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ order leads to several observable consequences,
including quasiparticles with fractionally quantized charges of magnitude $e/(3n)$ and the existence
of multiple neutral collective modes. It is interesting that the FQHE may be a promising venue for
the realization of exotic $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ superconductivity.
