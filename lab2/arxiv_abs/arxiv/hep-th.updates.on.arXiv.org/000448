In this work we study classical bouncing solutions in the context of $f({\sf R},{\sf T})={\sf R}+h({\sf
T})$ gravity in a flat {\sf FLRW} background using a perfect fluid as the only matter content. Our
investigation is based on introducing an effective fluid through defining effective energy density
and pressure; we call this reformulation as the "effective picture". These definitions have been
already introduced to study the energy conditions in $f({\sf R},{\sf T})$ gravity. We examine various
models to which different effective equations of state, corresponding to different $h({\sf T})$
functions, can be attributed. It is also discussed that one can link between an assumed $f({\sf R},{\sf
T})$ model in the effective picture and the theories with generalized equation of state ({\sf EoS}).
We obtain cosmological scenarios exhibiting a nonsingular bounce before and after which the Universe
lives within a de-Sitter phase. We then proceed to find general solutions for matter bounce and investigate
their properties. We show that the properties of bouncing solution in the effective picture of $f({\sf
R},{\sf T})$ gravity are as follows: for a specific form of the $f({\sf R,T})$ function, these solutions
are without any future singularities. Moreover, stability analysis of the nonsingular solutions
through matter density perturbations revealed that except two of the models, the parameters of
scalar-type perturbations for the other ones have a slight transient fluctuation around the bounce
point and damp to zero or a finite value at late times. Hence these bouncing solutions are stable against
scalar-type perturbations. It is possible that all energy conditions be respected by the real perfect
fluid, however, the null and the strong energy conditions can be violated by the effective fluid
near the bounce event.
