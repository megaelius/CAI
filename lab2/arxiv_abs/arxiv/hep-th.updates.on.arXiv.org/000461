The past decade has seen a tremendous effort toward unraveling the relationship between entanglement
and emergent spacetime. These investigations have revealed that entanglement between holographic
degrees of freedom is crucial for the existence of bulk spacetime. We examine this connection from
the other end of the entanglement spectrum and clarify the assertion that maximally entangled states
have no reconstructable spacetime. To do so, we first define the conditions for bulk reconstructability.
Under these terms, we scrutinize two cases of maximally entangled holographic states. One is the
familiar example of AdS black holes; these are dual to thermal states of the boundary CFT. Sending
the temperature to the cutoff scale makes the state maximally entangled and the respective black
hole consumes the spacetime. We then examine the de Sitter limit of FRW spacetimes. This limit is
maximally entangled if one formulates the boundary theory on the holographic screen. Paralleling
the AdS black hole, we find the resulting reconstructable region of spacetime vanishes. Motivated
by these results, we prove a theorem showing that maximally entangled states have no reconstructable
spacetime. Evidently, the emergence of spacetime is endemic to intermediate entanglement. By
studying the manner in which intermediate entanglement is achieved, we uncover important properties
about the boundary theory of FRW spacetimes. With this clarified understanding, our final discussion
elucidates the natural way in which holographic Hilbert spaces may house states dual to different
geometries. This paper provides a coherent picture clarifying the link between spacetime and entanglement
and develops many promising avenues of further work.
