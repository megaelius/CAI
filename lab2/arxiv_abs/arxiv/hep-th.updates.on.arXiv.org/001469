Continuum spacetime is expected to emerge via phase transition in discrete approaches to quantum
gravity. A promising example are tensorial and group field theories but their phase diagram remains
an open issue. The results of recent attempts in terms of the functional renormalization group method
remain inconclusive since they are restricted to truncations of low order. We overcome this barrier
with a local-potential approximation for $\textrm{U}(1)$ tensor fields at arbitrary rank $r$
focusing on a specific class of so-called cyclic-melonic interactions. Projecting on constant
field configurations, we obtain the full set of renormalization-group flow equations. At large
scales we find equivalence with $r-1$ dimensional $\textrm{O}(N)$ scalar field theory in the large-$N$
limit, modified by a tensor-specific, relatively large anomalous dimension. As a consequence,
in the large-volume limit there is a non-Gaussian fixed point with special non-integer critical
exponents for rank $r=4$ but not else. However, on small scales we find equivalence with the corresponding
scalar field theory with vanishing dimension, thus no phase transition. This is confirmed by numerical
analysis of the full non-autonomous equations where we always find symmetry restoration. The essential
reason for this effect are isolated zero modes. This result should therefore be true for tensor field
theories on any compact domain and including any tensor-invariant interactions. As a consequence,
we expect that group field theory on a non-compact group will be necessary to describe gravitational
degrees of freedom in a quantum regime together with a phase transition to continuum spacetime.
