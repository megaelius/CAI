Vacuum magnetic birefringence (VMB) is a nonlinear electromagnetic effect predicted by QED. In
addition to the effect from QED, the effect also has a possibility to probe the dark sector. The effect
predicted by QED is parity conservative, but the effect from the dark sector can induce parity violation.
To pursue this possibility, we calculated the effect from the dark sector with the generalized Heisenberg-Euler
effective Lagrangian that is applicable to parity-violating theories. Various dark sector models
exist, among which the contribution of the dark sector neutrinos to the VMB experiment is examined.
The contribution comes from the mixing of photon with the dark sector Z boson and violates parity,
thus inducing a parity-violating electromagnetic interaction. If the polarization vector is
denoted by ${\epsilon}(\theta_i)$ when its direction is rotated by an angle $\theta_i$ from the
direction of the applied magnetic field, the change of the polarization from ${\epsilon}(45^\circ)$
to ${\epsilon}(-45^\circ)$ and vice versa are examined. The contribution from the dark sector
modifies the magnitude of the polarization change, so it can be detected by measuring the magnitude
precisely. In addition to the change in the magnitude, the dark sector also induces parity-violating
effects. We also propose a new scheme to measure the effect of parity violation directly. By measuring
the change of polarization from ${\epsilon}(0^{\circ})$ to ${\epsilon}(90^\circ)$, and vice
versa, with a ring Fabry-P\'erot resonator, one can search for the effect directly. The signal that
appears in this scheme is evidence of parity violation from beyond standard model theories.
