In the previous papers, it is pointed out that a supersymmetric double-well matrix model corresponds
to a two-dimensional type IIA superstring theory on a Ramond-Ramond background at the level of correlation
functions. This was confirmed by agreement between their planar correlation functions. The supersymmetry
in the matrix model corresponds to the target space supersymmetry and it is shown to be spontaneously
broken by nonperturbative effect. Furthermore, in the matrix model we computed one-point functions
of single-trace operators to all order of genus expansion in its double scaling limit. We found that
this expansion is stringy and not Borel summable and hence there arises an ambiguity in applying
the Borel resummation technique. We confirmed that resurgence works here, namely this ambiguity
in perturbative series in a zero-instanton sector is exactly canceled by another ambiguity in a
one-instanton sector obtained by instanton calculation. In this paper we extend this analysis
and study resurgence structure of the two-point functions of the single trace operators. By using
results in the random matrix theory, we derive two-point functions at arbitrary genus and see that
the perturbative series in the zero-instanton sector again has an ambiguity. We find that the two-point
functions inevitably have logarithmic singularity even at higher genus. In this derivation we
obtain a new result of the two-point function expressed by the one-point function at the leading
order in the soft-edge scaling limit of the random matrix theory. We also compute an ambiguity in
the one-instanton sector by using the Airy kernel, and confirm that ambiguities in both sectors
cancel each other at the leading order in the double scaling limit. We thus clarify resurgence structure
of the two-point functions in the supersymmetric double-well matrix model.
