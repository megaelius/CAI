For more than 80 years theoretical physicists have been trying to develop a theory of quantum gravity
which would successfully combine the tenets of Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) together
with those of quantum field theory. At the current stage, there are various competing responses
to this challenge under construction. Attacking the problem of quantum gravity from the quantum
geometry perspective, where space and spacetime are discrete, the focus of this thesis lies on the
application of loop quantum gravity (LQG) and group field theory (GFT). We employ these two closely
related nonperturbative approaches to two areas where quantum gravity effects are broadly expected
to be relevant: black holes and quantum cosmology. Concerning black holes, apart from understanding
their inner structure, a pressing issue is to give a microscopic explanation for the phenomenon
of black hole entropy in terms of a discrete quantum geometry and relate it to the symmetries of the
horizon. Black hole models in LQG are typically constructed via the isolated horizon boundary condition
which gives rise to an effective description of the horizon geometry in terms SU(2) Chern-Simons
theory. In this thesis we find a reinterpretation of the statistics of the horizon degrees of freedom
as those of a system of non-Abelian anyons. As regards quantum cosmology, the challenge is to understand
how the initial singularity problem of GR can be resolved by means of the discreteness of geometry
and how a continuum spacetime can emerge from a large assembly of geometric building blocks. Most
recent research in GFT aims at deriving the effective dynamics for condensate states directly from
the microscopic GFT quantum dynamics and subsequently to extract a cosmological interpretation
from them. In this thesis we elaborate on aspects of this approach and study phenomenological consequences
in detail.
