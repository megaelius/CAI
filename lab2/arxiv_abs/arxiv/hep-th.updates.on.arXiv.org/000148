We present a fully flavour-covariant formalism for transport phenomena, by deriving Markovian
master equations that describe the time-evolution of particle number densities in a statistical
ensemble with arbitrary flavour content. As an application of this general formalism, we study
flavour effects in a scenario of resonant leptogenesis (RL) and obtain the flavour-covariant evolution
equations for heavy-neutrino and lepton number densities. This provides a complete and unified
description of RL, capturing three distinct physical phenomena: (i) the resonant mixing between
the heavy-neutrino states, (ii) coherent oscillations between different heavy-neutrino flavours,
and (iii) quantum decoherence effects in the charged-lepton sector. To illustrate the importance
of this formalism, we numerically solve the flavour-covariant rate equations for a minimal RL model
and show that the total lepton asymmetry can be enhanced up to one order of magnitude, as compared
to that obtained from flavour-diagonal or partially flavour off-diagonal rate equations. Thus,
the viable RL model parameter space is enlarged, thereby enhancing further the prospects of probing
a common origin of neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry in the Universe at the LHC, as well as in
low-energy experiments searching for lepton flavour and number violation. The key new ingredients
in our flavour-covariant formalism are rank-4 rate tensors, which are required for the consistency
of our flavour-mixing treatment, as shown by an explicit calculation of the relevant transition
amplitudes by generalizing the optical theorem. We also provide a geometric and physical interpretation
of the heavy-neutrino degeneracy limits in the minimal RL scenario. Furthermore, we comment on
the consistency of various suggested forms for the heavy-neutrino self-energy regulator in the
lepton-number conserving limit.
