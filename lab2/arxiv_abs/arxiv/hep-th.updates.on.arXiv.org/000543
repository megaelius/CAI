In theories with extended supersymmetry the protected observables of UV superconformal fixed
points are found in a number of contexts to be encoded in the BPS solitons along an IR Coulomb-like
phase. For six-dimensional SCFTs such a role is played by the BPS strings on the tensorial Coulomb
branch. In this paper we develop a uniform description of the worldsheet theories of a BPS string
for rank-one 6d SCFTs. These strings are the basic constituents of the BPS string spectrum of arbitrary
rank six-dimensional models, which they generate by forming bound states. Motivated by geometric
engineering in F-theory, we describe the worldsheet theories of the BPS strings in terms of topologically
twisted 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the presence of $1/2$-BPS 2d $(0,4)$ defects. As the superconformal
point of a 6d theory with gauge group $G$ is approached, the resulting worldsheet theory flows to
an $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ NLSM with target the moduli space of one $G$ instanton, together with a nontrivial
left moving bundle characterized by the matter content of the six-dimensional model. We compute
the anomaly polynomial and central charges of the NLSM, and argue that the 6d flavor symmetry $F$
is realized as a current algebra on the string, whose level we compute. We find evidence that for generic
theories the $G$ dependence is captured at the level of the elliptic genus by characters of an affine
Kac-Moody algebra at negative level, which we interpret as a subsector of the chiral algebra of the
BPS string worldsheet theory. We also find evidence for a spectral flow relating the R-R and NS-R
elliptic genera. These properties of the string CFTs lead to constraints on their spectra, which
in combination with modularity allow us to determine the elliptic genera of a vast number of string
CFTs, leading also to novel results for 6d and 5d instanton partition functions.
