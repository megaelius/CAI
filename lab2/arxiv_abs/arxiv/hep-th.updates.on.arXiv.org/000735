In this paper, we show how the structure of the landscape potential of the primordial Universe may
be probed through the properties of the primordial density perturbations responsible for the origin
of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the large-scale structure of our Universe.
Isocurvature fields -fields orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory- may have fluctuated across
the barriers separating local minima of the landscape potential during inflation. We analyze how
this process could have impacted the evolution of the primordial curvature perturbations. If the
typical distance separating consecutive minima of the landscape potential and the height of the
potential barriers are smaller than the Hubble expansion rate parametrizing inflation, the probability
distribution function of isocurvature fields becomes non-Gaussian due to the appearance of bumps
and dips associated to the structure of the potential. We show that this non-Gaussianity can be transferred
to the statistics of primordial curvature perturbations if the isocurvature fields are coupled
to the curvature perturbations. The type of non-Gaussian structure that emerges in the distribution
of curvature perturbations cannot be fully probed with the standard methods of polyspectra; instead,
the probability distribution function is needed. The latter is obtained by summing all the $n$-point
correlation functions. To substantiate our claims, we offer a concrete model consisting of an axionlike
isocurvature perturbation with a sinusoidal potential and a linear derivative coupling between
the isocurvature and curvature fields. In this model, the probability distribution function of
the curvature perturbations consists of a Gaussian function with small superimposed oscillations
reflecting the isocurvature axion potential.
