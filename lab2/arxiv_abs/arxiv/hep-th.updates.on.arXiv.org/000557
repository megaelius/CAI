We investigate approximate emergent nonabelian symmetry in a class of weakly first order `deconfined'
phase transitions using Monte Carlo simulations. We study a transition in a 3D classical loop model
that is analogous to a deconfined 2+1D quantum phase transition in a magnet with reduced lattice
symmetry. This transition is between the N\'eel phase and a twofold degenerate valence bond solid
(lattice-symmetry-breaking) phase. The combined order parameter at the transition is effectively
a four-component superspin. It has been argued that in some weakly first order `pseudocritical'
deconfined phase transitions, the renormalization group flow can take the system very close to
the ordered fixed point of the symmetric $O(N)$ sigma model, where $N$ is the total number of `soft'
order parameter components, despite the fact that $O(N)$ is not a microscopic symmetry. This yields
a first order transition with unconventional phenomenology. We argue that this occurs in the present
model, with $N=4$. This means that there is a regime of lengthscales in which the transition resembles
a `spin-flop' transition in the ordered $O(4)$ sigma model. We give numerical evidence for (i) the
first order nature of the transition, (ii) the emergence of $O(4)$ symmetry to an accurate approximation,
and (iii) the existence of a regime in which the emergent $O(4)$ is `spontaneously broken', with
distinctive features in the order parameter probability distribution. These results may be relevant
for other models studied in the literature, including 2+1D QED with two flavours, the `easy-plane'
deconfined critical point, and the N\'eel--VBS transition on the rectangular lattice.
