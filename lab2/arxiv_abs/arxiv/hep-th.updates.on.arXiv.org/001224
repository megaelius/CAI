Motivated by the current status of the cosmological observations and significant tensions in the
estimated values of some key parameters assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, we propose a
simple but radical phenomenological emergent dark energy model where dark energy has no effective
presence in the past and emerges at the later times. Theoretically, in this phenomenological dark
energy model with zero degree of freedom (similar to a $\Lambda$CDM model), one can derive that the
equation of state of dark energy increases from $-\frac{2}{3 {\rm{ln}}\, 10} -1$ in the past to $-1$
in the future. We show that by setting a hard-cut 2$\sigma$ lower bound prior for the $H_0$ that associates
with $97.72\%$ probability from the recent local observations~\citep{riess2019large}, this
model can satisfy different combinations of cosmological observations at low and high redshifts
(SNe Ia, BAO, Ly{$\alpha$} BAO and CMB) substantially better than the concordance $\Lambda$CDM
model with $\Delta \chi^2_{bf} \sim -41.08$ and $\Delta\,{\rm{DIC}} \sim-35.38$. If there are
no substantial systematics in SN Ia, BAO or Planck CMB data and assuming reliability of the current
local $H_0$ measurements, there is a very high probability that with slightly more precise measurement
of the Hubble constant our proposed phenomenological model rules out the cosmological constant
with decisive statistical significance and is a strong alternative to explain combination of different
cosmological observations. This simple phenomenologically emergent dark energy model can guide
theoretically motivated dark energy model building activities.
