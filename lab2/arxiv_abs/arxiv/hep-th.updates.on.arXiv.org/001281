We consider resolutions of codimension-two enhanced singularities from $SO(12)$ to $E_7$ and
from $E_7$ to $E_8$ in six-dimensional F theory, where a half-hypermultiplet arises for generic
complex structures achieving them. The exceptional fibers at the enhanced point exhibit different
structures depending on how the colliding 7-brane approaches the stack of gauge 7-branes, as previously
observed by Morrison and Taylor in the case of the enhancement from $SU(6)$ to $E_6$. When the colliding
brane approaches them as $O(s)$, where $s$ is the coordinate of the base space along the gauge 7-branes,
the resolution process ends up with fewer exceptional fibers than naively expected from the Kodaira
classification, with a non-Dynkin intersection matrix including half-integral intersection
numbers. We confirm that the exceptional fibers at the enhanced point form extremal rays of the cone
of the positive weights of the relevant pseudo-real representation, explaining why a half-hypermultiplet
arises there. By altering the ordering of the singularities blown up in the process, we obtain, for
both $SO(12)\rightarrow E_7$ and $E_7\rightarrow E_8$, the intersection diagram on every other
row of the corresponding box graphs. We present detailed derivations of the intersection diagrams
of the exceptional fibers at the singularity enhanced points by examining how an exceptional curve
is lifted up on the chart arising due to the subsequent blowing-up process. When the colliding brane
approaches the stack of branes as $O(s^2)$, we obtain additional conifold singularity at the enhanced
point, which completes the full Dynkin diagram of the enhanced group as was found previously.
