In this thesis the recently developed duality covariant approach to string and M-theory is investigated.
In this formalism the U-duality symmetry of M-theory or T-duality symmetry of Type II string theory
becomes manifest upon extending coordinates that describe a background. The effective potential
of Double Field Theory is formulated only up to a boundary term and thus does not capture possible
topological effects that may come from a boundary. By introducing a generalised normal we derive
a manifestly duality covariant boundary term that reproduces the known Gibbons-Hawking action
of General Relativity, if the section condition is imposed. It is shown that the full potential can
be represented as a sum of the scalar potential of gauged supergravity and a topological term that
is a full derivative. The latter is conjectured to capture non-trivial topological information
of the corresponding background, such as monodromy around an exotic brane. Next we show that the
Scherk-Schwarz reduction of M-theory extended geometry successfully reproduces known structures
of maximal gauged supergravities. Local symmetries of the extended space defined by a generalised
Lie derivatives reduce to gauge transformations and lead to the embedding tensor written in terms
of twist matrices. The scalar potential of maximal gauged supergravity that follows from the effective
potential is shown to be duality invariant with no need of section condition. Instead, this condition,
that assures the closure of the algebra of generalised diffeomorphisms, takes the form of the quadratic
constraints on the embedding tensor.
