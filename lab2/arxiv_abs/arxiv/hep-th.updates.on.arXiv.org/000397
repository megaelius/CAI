We develop numerical tools for Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo simulations of non-Abelian lattice field
theories in the t'Hooft large-N limit based on the weak-coupling expansion. First we note that the
path integral measure of such theories contributes a bare mass term in the effective action which
is proportional to the bare coupling constant. This mass term renders the perturbative expansion
infrared-finite and allows to study it directly in the large-N and infinite-volume limits using
the Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo approach. On the exactly solvable example of a large-N O(N) sigma
model in D=2 dimensions we show that this infrared-finite weak-coupling expansion contains, in
addition to powers of bare coupling, also powers of its logarithm, reminiscent of re-summed perturbation
theory in thermal field theory and resurgent trans-series without exponential terms. We numerically
demonstrate the convergence of these double series to the manifestly non-perturbative dynamical
mass gap. We then develop a Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo algorithm for sampling planar diagrams in
the large-N matrix field theory, and apply it to study this infrared-finite weak-coupling expansion
for large-N U(N)xU(N) nonlinear sigma model (principal chiral model) in D=2. We sample up to 12 leading
orders of the weak-coupling expansion, which is the practical limit set by the increasingly strong
sign problem at high orders. Comparing Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo with conventional Monte-Carlo
simulations extrapolated to infinite N, we find a good agreement for the energy density as well as
for the critical temperature of the "deconfinement" transition. Finally, we comment on the applicability
of our approach to planar QCD at zero and finite density.
