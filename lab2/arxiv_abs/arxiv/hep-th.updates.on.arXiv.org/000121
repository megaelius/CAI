In this review article, we discuss the distinction and possible equivalence between scale invariance
and conformal invariance in relativistic quantum field theories. Under some technical assumptions,
we can prove that scale invariant quantum field theories in $d=2$ dimension necessarily possess
the enhanced conformal symmetry. The use of the conformal symmetry is well appreciated in the literature,
but the fact that all the scale invariant phenomena in $d=2$ dimension enjoy the conformal property
relies on the deep structure of the renormalization group. The outstanding question is whether
this feature is specific to $d=2$ dimension or it holds in higher dimensions, too. As of January 2014,
our consensus is that there is no known example of scale invariant but non-conformal field theories
in $d=4$ dimension under the assumptions of (1) unitarity, (2) Poincar\'e invariance (causality),
(3) discrete spectrum in scaling dimension, (4) existence of scale current and (5) unbroken scale
invariance in the vacuum. We have a perturbative proof of the enhancement of conformal invariance
from scale invariance based on the higher dimensional analogue of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem,
but the non-perturbative proof is yet to come. As a reference we have tried to collect as many interesting
examples of scale invariance in relativistic quantum field theories as possible in this article.
We give a complementary holographic argument based on the energy-condition of the gravitational
system and the space-time diffeomorphism in order to support the claim of the symmetry enhancement.
We believe that the possible enhancement of conformal invariance from scale invariance reveals
the sublime nature of the renormalization group and space-time with holography.
