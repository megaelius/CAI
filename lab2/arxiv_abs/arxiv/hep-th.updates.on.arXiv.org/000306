We investigate topological Cooper pairing, including gapless Weyl and fully gapped class DIII
superconductivity, in a three-dimensional doped Luttinger semimetal. The latter describes effective
spin-3/2 carriers near a quadratic band touching and captures the normal-state properties of the
227 pyrochlore iridates and half-Heusler alloys. Electron-electron interactions may favor non-$s$-wave
pairing in such systems, including even-parity $d$-wave pairing. We argue that the lowest energy
$d$-wave pairings are always of complex (e.g., $d + i d$) type, with nodal Weyl quasiparticles. This
implies $\varrho(E) \sim |E|^2$ scaling of the density of states (DoS) at low energies in the clean
limit, or $\varrho(E) \sim |E|$ over a wide critical region in the presence of disorder. The latter
is consistent with the $T$-dependence of the penetration depth in the half-Heusler compound YPtBi.
We enumerate routes for experimental verification, including specific heat, thermal conductivity,
NMR relaxation time, and topological Fermi arcs. Nucleation of any $d$-wave pairing also causes
a small lattice distortion and induces an $s$-wave component; this gives a route to strain-engineer
exotic $s+d$ pairings. We also consider odd-parity, fully gapped $p$-wave superconductivity.
For hole doping, a gapless Majorana fluid with cubic dispersion appears at the surface. We invent
a generalized surface model with $\nu$-fold dispersion to simulate a bulk with winding number $\nu$.
Using exact diagonalization, we show that disorder drives the surface into a critically delocalized
phase, with universal DoS and multifractal scaling consistent with the conformal field theory
(CFT) SO($n$)${}_\nu$, where $n \rightarrow 0$ counts replicas. This is contrary to the naive expectation
of a surface thermal metal, and implies that the topology tunes the surface renormalization group
to the CFT in the presence of disorder.
