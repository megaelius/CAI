The solutions of many issues, of the ongoing efforts to make deformed graphene a tabletop quantum
field theory in curved spacetimes, are presented. A detailed explanation of the special features
of curved spacetimes, originating from embedding portions of the Lobachevsky plane into $\mathbf{R}^3$,
is given, and the special role of coordinates for the physical realizations in graphene, is explicitly
shown, in general, and for various examples. The Rindler spacetime is reobtained, with new important
differences with respect to earlier results. The de Sitter spacetime naturally emerges, for the
first time, paving the way to future applications in cosmology. The role of the BTZ black hole is also
briefly addressed. The singular boundary of the pseudospheres, "Hilbert horizon", is seen to be
closely related to event horizon of the Rindler, de Sitter, and BTZ kind. This gives new, and stronger,
arguments for the Hawking phenomenon to take place. An important geometric parameter, $c$, overlooked
in earlier work, takes here its place for physical applications, and it is shown to be related to graphene's
lattice spacing, $\ell$. It is shown that all surfaces of constant negative curvature, ${\cal K}
= -r^{-2}$, are unified, in the limit $c/r \to 0$, where they are locally applicable to the Beltrami
pseudosphere. This, and $c = \ell$, allow us a) to have a phenomenological control on the reaching
of the horizon; b) to use spacetimes different than Rindler for the Hawking phenomenon; c) to approach
the generic surface of the family. An improved expression for the thermal LDOS is obtained. A non-thermal
term for the total LDOS is found. It takes into account: a) the peculiarities of the graphene-based
Rindler spacetime; b) the finiteness of a laboratory surface; c) the optimal use of the Minkowski
quantum vacuum, through the choice of this Minkowski-static boundary.
