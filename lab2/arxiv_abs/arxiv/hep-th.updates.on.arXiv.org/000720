We study the $O(N)$ and Gross-Neveu models at large $N$ on AdS$_{d+1}$ background. Thanks to the
isometries of AdS, the observables in these theories are constrained by the SO$(d,2)$ conformal
group even in the presence of mass deformations, as was discussed by Callan and Wilczek, and provide
an interesting two-parameter family of quantities which interpolate between the S-matrices in
flat space and the correlators in CFT with a boundary. For the actual computation, we judiciously
use the spectral representation to resum loop diagrams in the bulk. After the resummation, the AdS
$4$-particle scattering amplitude is given in terms of a single unknown function of the spectral
parameter. We then "bootstrap" the unknown function by requiring the absence of double-trace operators
in the boundary OPE. Our results are at leading nontrivial order in $\frac{1}{N}$, and include the
full dependence on the quartic coupling, the mass parameters, and the AdS radius. In the bosonic
$O(N)$ model we study both the massive phase and the symmetry-breaking phase, which exists even
in AdS$_2$ evading Coleman's theorem, and identify the AdS analogue of a resonance in flat space.
We then propose that symmetry breaking in AdS implies the existence of a conformal manifold in the
boundary conformal theory. We also provide evidence for the existence of a critical point with bulk
conformal symmetry, matching existing results and finding new ones for the conformal boundary
conditions of the critical theories. For the Gross-Neveu model we find a bound state, which interpolates
between the familiar bound state in flat space and the displacement operator at the critical point.
