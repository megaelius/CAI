Recent and upcoming experimental data as well as the possibility of rich phenomenology have spiked
interest in studying the quantum effects in cosmology at low (inflation-era) energy scales. One
of the approaches to find covariant quantum corrections is the DeWitt-Vilkovisky's (DV) covariant
effective action formalism that is gauge invariant and background field invariant. We use the DeWitt-Vilkovisky
method to study formal and cosmological aspects of quantum fields in curved spacetime, and take
initial steps towards studying quantum gravitational corrections in cosmological setting. The
thesis comprises of mainly two parts. We first study the formal aspects of rank-2 antisymmetric
tensor field which appear in the low energy limit of superstring models and are thus relevant in the
early universe, in particular the quantization and quantum equivalence properties, for the case
with and without spontaneous Lorentz violation. The effective action is generalized for gauge
theories whose gauge parameters possess additional symmetries. When used in the case of spontaneously
Lorentz violating antisymmetric tensor field model, it is found that classical equivalence with
a vector theory breaks down at one-loop level due to the presence of Lorentz violating terms. The
final chapter of this thesis is devoted to taking first steps towards exploring applications of
DV method in early universe cosmology. We calculate perturbatively the covariant one-loop quantum
gravitational effective action for a scalar field model inspired by the recently proposed nonminimal
natural inflation model. The effective potential is evaluated taking into account the finite corrections,
and an order-of-magnitude estimate of the one-loop corrections reveals that gravitational and
non-gravitational corrections have same or comparable magnitudes.
