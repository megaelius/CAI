We study novel three-dimensional gapped quantum phases of matter which support quasiparticles
with restricted mobility, including immobile "fracton" excitations. So far, most existing fracton
models may be instructively viewed as generalized Abelian lattice gauge theories. Here, by analogy
with Dijkgraaf-Witten topological gauge theories, we discover a natural generalization of fracton
models, obtained by twisting the gauge symmetries. Introducing generalized gauge transformation
operators carrying an extra phase factor depending on local configurations, we construct a plethora
of exactly solvable three-dimensional models, which we dub "twisted fracton models." A key result
of our approach is to demonstrate the existence of rich non-Abelian fracton phases of distinct varieties
in a three-dimensional system with finite-range interactions. For an accurate characterization
of these novel phases, the notion of being inextricably non-Abelian is introduced for fractons
and quasiparticles with one-dimensional mobility, referring to their new behavior of displaying
braiding statistics that is, and remains, non-Abelian regardless of which quasiparticles with
higher mobility are added to or removed from them. We also analyze these models by embedding them
on a three-torus and computing their ground state degeneracies, which exhibit a surprising and
novel dependence on the system size in the non-Abelian fracton phases. Moreover, as an important
advance in the study of fracton order, we develop a general mathematical framework which systematically
captures the fusion and braiding properties of fractons and other quasiparticles with restricted
mobility.
