Euclidean quantum gravity might be defined by stochastic quantisation that is governed by a higher
order Langevin equation rather than a first order stochastic equation. In a transitory phase where
the Minkowski time cannot be defined, the parameter that orders the evolution of quantum gravity
phenomena is the stochastic time. This changes the definition of causality in the period of primordial
cosmology. For stochastically quantised gravity, the prediction is that there will a transition
from an oscillating quantum phase to a classical one, where the Minkowski time has emerged. The end
of the transition, as it can be observed from now and described by inflation models, is a diluted Universe,
following the inflation phenomenological evolution. It is filled at the beginning with scattered
classical primordial black holes. The smallest ones will quickly decay in matter, with a standard
quantum field theory evolution till our period. The stable heavier black holes will remain, forming
a good fraction of the dark matter and the large black holes observed in the galaxies. In a theoretically
related way, this framework suggests the possibility of a gravitational parton content for "point-like"
particles, in the same five dimensional quantum field theory context as in the primordial cosmology,
with a (+----) signature for the $5$d metrics. The very precise and explicit result expressed in
this paper is actually far more modest than its motivation. We compute explicitly the meaning of
a second order Langevin equation in zero dimensions and define precisely what is second order stochastic
quantisation in a soluble case.
