We consider the generic massless cubic gravities coupled to a negative bare cosmological constant
mainly in $D=5$ and $D=4$ dimensions, which are Einstein gravity extended with cubic curvature
invariants where the linearized excited spectrum around the AdS background contains no massive
modes. The generic massless cubic gravities are more general than Myers quasi-topological gravity
in $D=5$ and Einsteinian cubic gravity in $D=4$. It turns out that the massless cubic gravities admit
the black holes at least in a perturbative sense with the coupling constants of the cubic terms becoming
infinitesimal. The first order approximate black hole solutions with arbitrary boundary topology
$k$ are presented, and in addition, the second order approximate planar black holes are exhibited
as well. We then establish the holographic dictionary for such theories by presenting $a$-charge,
$C_T$-charge and energy flux parameters $t_2$ and $t_4$. By perturbatively discussing the holographic
R\'enyi entropy, we find $a$, $C_T$ and $t_4$ can somehow determine the R\'enyi entropy with the
limit $q\rightarrow 1$, $q\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ up to the first order, where
$q$ is the order of the R\'enyi entropy. For holographic hydrodynamics, we discuss the shear-viscosity-entropy-ratio
and find that the patterns deviating from the KSS bound $1/(4\pi)$ can somehow be controlled by $((c-a)/c,t_4)$
up to the first order in $D=5$, and $((\mathcal{C}_T-\tilde{a})/\mathcal{C}_T,t_4)$ up to the
second order in $D=4$, where $\mathcal{C}_T$ and $\tilde{a}$ differ from $C_T$-charge and $a$-charge
by inessential overall constants.
