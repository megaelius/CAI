In this paper only one basic assumption has been made: if we try to describe black holes, their behavior
should be understood in the same language as the one we use for particles; black holes should be treated
just like atoms. They must be quantum forms of matter, moving in accordance with Schr\"odinger equations
just like everything else. In particular, Rosen's quantization approach to the gravitational
collapse is applied in the simple case of a pressureless "star of dust" by finding the gravitational
potential, the Schr\"odinger equation and the solution for the collapse's energy levels. By applying
the constraints for a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) and by using the concept of BH effective state,
previously introduced by one of the authors (CC), the BH quantum gravitational potential, Schr\"odinger
equation and the BH energy spectrum are found. Remarkably, such an energy spectrum is in agreement
(in its absolute value) with the one which was conjectured by Bekenstein in 1974 and consistent with
other ones in the literature. This approach also permits to find an interesting quantum representation
of the Schwarzschild BH ground state at the Planck scale. Moreover, two fundamental issues about
black hole quantum physics are addressed by this model: the area quantization and the singularity
resolution. As regards the former, a result similar to the one obtained by Bekenstein, but with a
different coefficient, has been found. About the latter, it is shown that the traditional classical
singularity in the core of the Schwarzschild BH is replaced, in a full quantum treatment, by a two-particle
system where the two components strongly interact with each other via a quantum gravitational potential.
The two-particle system seems to be non-singular from the quantum point of view and is analogous
to the hydrogen atom because it consists of a "nucleus" and an "electron".
