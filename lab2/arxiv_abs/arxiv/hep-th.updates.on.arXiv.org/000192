The dependence of physical properties of the electrically charged two-poles monopole-antimonopole
pair (MAP) solutions in the Higgs self-coupling constant is previously investigated. In this paper
we study the three-poles monopole-antimonopole chain (MAC) solutions. The study includes $\phi$-winding
number $n=2,3,4$, and $5$. For the case of $n=2$, there is no bifurcating branch along with the fundamental
solution. Also no transition happens for this solution for the Higgs self-coupling interval of
$0\leq \lambda \leq 144$. For the case of $n=3$, two transitions happen along the fundamental solution.
Also at a higher energy, there are two bifurcating branches. The lower energy branch of these bifurcating
branches, merges with the fundamental solution and both terminate at the convergence point and
do not survive for larger values of $\lambda$. For $n=4$, a bifurcation is observed at higher energy
in comparison with the fundamental solution. Here there are three transitions. One is observed
along the fundamental solution and the others happen along the higher energy bifurcating branch.
For the case of $n=5$, the pattern is more complex. A bifurcation in $\lambda = \lambda_{b1}$ happens
with a higher energy than the fundamental solution. A second bifurcation is observed at $\lambda
= \lambda_{b2}$. The two branches of the second bifurcation are both very close in energy to the lower
energy branch of the first bifurcation, but they have different electrical and geometrical properties.
Therefore, for the case of $n=5$, we have three distinct solution for the interval of $\lambda_{b1}\leq
\lambda \leq \lambda_{b2}$ and five distinct solutions for $\lambda_{b2}\leq \lambda \leq 300$.
Also two transitions are observed in the higher energy branch of the first bifurcation.
