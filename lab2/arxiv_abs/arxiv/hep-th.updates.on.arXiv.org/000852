Scalaron-Higgs inflation is a theoretically well motivated model in which the Standard Model Higgs
boson is non-minimally coupled to gravity and the Einstein-Hilbert action is supplemented by the
quadratic scalar curvature invariant. We perform a careful study of the inflationary background
dynamics of the resulting two-field model over a wide range of the parameters, including the dependence
on the initial conditions. For the value of the Higgs self-coupling fixed at the electroweak scale,
we find that the model effectively reduces to a single field model with the same predictions as for
the models of non-minimal Higgs inflation or Starobinsky inflation, independently of the initial
conditions of the inflationary two-field dynamics. We also explore the consequences of a very small
Higgs self-coupling and find different inflationary scenarios depending on the initial conditions.
Such a small value for the Higgs self-coupling might be dynamically realized at inflationary energy
scales by the combined scalaron-Higgs Standard Model renormalization group running. For a certain
class of initial conditions, we find that the two-field model again reduces to an effective single-field
description, but with a larger tensor-to-scalar ratio than predicted in non-minimal Higgs inflation
or Starobinsky inflation. For another class of initial conditions, the scalaron-Higgs model exhibits
multifield effects, which lead to oscillatory features in the power spectrum that might be of relevance
for explaining the large scale anomalies observed in the temperature anisotropy spectrum of the
cosmic microwave background radiation. Finally, we discuss how the scalaron-Higgs model could
provide a natural way to stabilize the electroweak vacuum.
