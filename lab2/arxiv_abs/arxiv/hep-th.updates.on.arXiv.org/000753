We reconsider a one-parameter class of known solutions of the circle compactification of Romans
six-dimensional half-maximal supergravity. The gauge-theory duals of these solutions are confining
four-dimensional field theories. Their UV completions consist of the compactification on a circle
of a higher-dimensional field theory that is flowing between two fixed points in five dimensions.
We systematically study the bosonic fluctuations of the supergravity theory, corresponding to
the bosonic glueballs of the dual field theory. We perform numerically the calculation of the spectrum
of excitations of all the bosonic fields, several of which had been disregarded in earlier work on
the subject. We discuss the results as a function of the one parameter characterising the class of
background solutions, hence further extending known results. We show how certain towers of states
are independent of the background, and compare these states to existing lattice literature on four-dimensional
Yang-Mills (pure) gauge theories, confirming the existence of close similarities. For the aforementioned
analysis, we construct gauge-invariant combinations of the fields appearing in the reduction
to five dimensions of the supergravity theory, and hence focus on the 32 physical bosonic degrees
of freedom. We show explicitly how to implement gauge-fixing of the supergravity theory. The results
of such technical work could be used to analyse the spectra of other theories proposed in the context
of top-down holography. For example, it could be applied to holographic realisations of composite-Higgs
and light-dilaton scenarios.
