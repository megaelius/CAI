We consider the modified Einstein equations obtained in the framework of effective spherically
symmetric polymer models inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity. When one takes into account the anomaly
free point-wise holonomy quantum corrections, the modification of Einstein equations is parametrized
by a function $f(x)$ of one phase space variable. We solve explicitly these equations for a static
interior black hole geometry and find the effective metric describing the trapped region, inside
the black hole, for any $f(x)$. This general resolution allows to take into account a standard ambiguity
inherent to the polymer regularization: namely the choice of the spin $j$ labelling the SU$(2)$-representation
of the holonomy corrections. When $j=1/2$, the function $f(x)$ is the usual sine function used in
the polymer litterature. For this simple case, the effective exterior metric remains the classical
Schwarzschild's one but acquires modifications inside the hole. The interior metric describes
a regular trapped region and presents strong similarities with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric,
with a new inner horizon generated by quantum effects. We discuss the gluing of our interior solution
to the exterior Schwarzschild metric and the challenge to extend the solution outside the trapped
region due to covariance requirement. By starting from the anomaly free polymer regularization
for inhomogeneous spherically symmetric geometry, and then reducing to the homogeneous interior
problem, we provide an alternative treatment to existing polymer interior black hole models which
focus directly on the interior geometry, ignoring covariance issue when introducing the polymer
regularization.
