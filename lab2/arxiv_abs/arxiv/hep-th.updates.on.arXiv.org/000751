Creation of thermal distribution of particles by a black hole is independent of the detail of gravitational
collapse, making the construction of the eternal horizons suffice to address the problem in asymptotically
flat spacetimes. For eternal de Sitter black holes however, earlier studies have shown the existence
of both thermal and non-thermal particle creation, originating from the non-trivial causal structure
of these spacetimes. Keeping this in mind we consider this problem in the context of a quasistationary
gravitational collapse occurring in a $(3+1)$-dimensional eternal de Sitter, settling down to
a Schwarzschild- or Kerr-de Sitter spacetime and consider a massless minimally coupled scalar
field. There can be only one physically meaningful `in' vacuum here, defined with respect to the
positive frequency cosmological Kruskal modes localised on the past cosmological horizon ${\cal
C^-}$, at the onset of the collapse. We define our `out' vacuum `close' to the future cosmological
horizon, ${\cal C^+}$, with respect to positive frequency outgoing modes written in terms of the
ordinary retarded null coordinate, $u$. We trace such modes back to ${\cal C^-}$ along past directed
null geodesics through the collapsing body. Some part of the wave will be reflected back without
entering it due to the greybody effect. We show that these two kind of traced back modes yield the two
temperature spectra and fluxes subject to the aforementioned `in' vacuum. Since the coordinate
$u$ used in the `out' modes is not well defined on a horizon, estimate on how `close' we might be to ${\cal
C^+}$ is given by estimating backreaction. We argue no other reasonable choice of the `out' vacuum
would give rise to any thermal spectra. Our conclusions remain valid for all non-Nariai class black
holes, irrespective of the relative sizes of the two horizons.
