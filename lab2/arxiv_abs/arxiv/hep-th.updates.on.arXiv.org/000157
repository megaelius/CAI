We investigate SU(3) gauge theories in four dimensions with Nf fundamental fermions, on a lattice
using the Wilson fermion. Clarifying the vacuum structure in terms of Polyakov loops in spatial
directions and properties of temporal propagators using a new method "local analysis", we conjecture
that the "conformal region" exists together with the confining region and the deconfining region
in the phase structure parametrized by beta and K, both in the cases of the large Nf QCD within the conformal
window (referred as Conformal QCD) with an IR cutoff and small Nf QCD at T/Tc>1 with Tc being the
chiral transition temperature (referred as High Temperature QCD). Our numerical simulation on
a lattice of the size 16^3 x 64 shows the following evidence of the conjecture. In the conformal region
we find the vacuum is the nontrivial Z(3) twisted vacuum modified by non-perturbative effects and
temporal propagators of meson behave at large t as a power-law corrected Yukawa-type decaying form.
The transition from the conformal region to the deconfining region or the confining region is a sharp
transition between different vacua and therefore it suggests a first order transition both in Conformal
QCD and in High Temperature QCD. Within our fixed lattice simulation, we find that there is a precise
correspondence between Conformal QCD and High Temperature QCD in the temporal propagators under
the change of the parameters Nf and T/Tc respectively. In particular, we find the correspondence
between Conformal QCD with Nf = 7 and High Temperature QCD with Nf=2 at T ~ 2 Tc being in close relation
to a meson unparticle model. From this we estimate the anomalous mass dimension gamma* = 1.2 (1) for
Nf=7. We also show that the asymptotic state in the limit T/Tc --> infty is a free quark state in
the Z(3) twisted vacuum.
