We propose that the initial state of the Universe was an isotropic state of maximal entropy. Such
a state can be described in terms of a state of closed, interacting, fundamental strings in their
high-temperature Hagedorn phase. The entropy density in this state is equal to the square root of
the energy density in Planck units, while the pressure is positive and equal to the energy density.
These relations imply a maximally large entropy density and, therefore, a state that cannot be described
by a semiclassical spacetime geometry. If one nevertheless insists on an effective semiclassical
description of this state, she can do so by ignoring the entropy. This leads to a partially equivalent
description in which the pressure appears to be negative and equal in magnitude to the energy density,
as if the energy-momentum tensor was that of a cosmological constant. From this effective perspective,
the state describes a period of string-scale inflation. The bound state of strings ultimately decays,
possibly by a process akin to Hawking radiation, and undergoes a transition into a phase of hot radiation.
But, from the effective perspective, the same decay corresponds to the heating of the Universe at
the end of inflation. Small quantum mechanical fluctuations in the initial state lead to scale-invariant
temperature anisotropies in the hot radiation. The temperature anisotropies are interpreted
in the effective description as arising from quantum fluctuations of the curvature and an effective
inflaton field. The stringy microscopic description determines the parameters of the model of
inflation, as well as the cosmological observables, in terms of the string length scale and coupling
strength. Our framework is similar, conceptually, to a recent description of black holes in terms
of a maximal entropy state of strings in the Hagedorn phase.
