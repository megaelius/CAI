We present measurements of relativistic scaling relations in $(2+1)$-dimensional conformal
fluid turbulence from direct numerical simulations, in the weakly compressible regime. These
relations were analytically derived previously in Westernacher-Schneider, Lehner, Oz (2015)
for a relativistic fluid; this work is a continuation of that study, providing further analytical
insights together with numerical experiments to test the scaling relations and extract other important
features characterizing the turbulent behavior. We first explicitly demonstrate that the non-relativistic
limit of these scaling relations reduce to known results from the statistical theory of incompressible
Navier-Stokes turbulence. In simulations of the inverse-cascade range, we find the relevant relativistic
scaling relation is satisfied to a high degree of accuracy. We observe that the non-relativistic
versions of this scaling relation underperform the relativistic one in both an absolute and relative
sense, with a progressive degradation as the rms Mach number increases from $0.14$ to $0.19$. In
the direct-cascade range, the two relevant relativistic scaling relations are satisfied with
a lower degree of accuracy in a simulation with rms Mach number $0.11$. We elucidate the poorer agreement
with further simulations of an incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid. Finally, as has been observed
in the incompressible Navier-Stokes case, we show that the energy spectrum in the inverse-cascade
of the conformal fluid exhibits $k^{-2}$ scaling rather than the Kolmogorov/Kraichnan expectation
of $k^{-5/3}$, and that it is not necessarily associated with compressive effects. We comment on
the implications for a recent calculation of the fractal dimension of a turbulent $(3+1)$-dimensional
AdS black brane.
