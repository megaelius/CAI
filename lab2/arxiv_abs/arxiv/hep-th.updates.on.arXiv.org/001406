In the context of the holographic duality, the entanglement entropy of ordinary QFT in a subregion
in the boundary is given by a quarter of the area of an minimal surface embedded in the bulk spacetime.
This rule has been also extended to a suitable one-parameter generalization of the von-Neuman entropy
$\hat{S}_n$ that is related to the R\'enyi entropies $S_n$, as given by the area of a \emph{cosmic
brane} minimally coupled with gravity, with a tension related to $n$ that vanishes as $n\to1$, and
moreover, this parameter can be analytically extended to arbitrary real values. However, the brane
action plays no role in the duality and cannot be considered a part of the theory of gravity, thus it
is used as an auxiliary tool to find the correct background geometry. In this work we study the construction
of the gravitational (reduced) density matrix from holographic states, whose wave-functionals
are described as euclidean path integrals with arbitrary conditions on the asymptotic boundaries,
and argue that in general, a non-trivial Hayward term must be haven into account. So we propose that
the gravity model with a coupled Nambu-Goto action is not an artificial tool to account for the R\'enyi
entropies, but it is present in the own gravity action through a Hayward term. As a result we show that
the computations using replicas simplify considerably and we recover the holographic prescriptions
for the measures of entanglement entropy; in particular, derive an area law for the original R\'enyi
entropies ($S_n$) related to a minimal surface in the $n$ replicated spacetime. Moreover, we show
that the gravitational modular flow contains the area operator and can explain the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh
proposal.
