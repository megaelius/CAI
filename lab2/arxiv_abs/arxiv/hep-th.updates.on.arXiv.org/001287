We develop a general framework for the description of anomalies using extended functorial field
theories extending previous work by Freed and Monnier. In this framework, anomalies are described
by invertible field theories in one dimension higher and anomalous field theories live on their
boundaries. We provide precise mathematical definitions for all concepts involved using the language
of symmetric monoidal bicategories. In particular, field theories with anomalies will be described
by symmetric monoidal transformations. The use of higher categorical concepts is necessary to
capture the Hamiltonian picture of anomalies. The relation to the path integral and the Hamiltonian
description of anomalies will be explained in detail. Furthermore, we discuss anomaly inflow in
detail. We apply the general framework to the parity anomaly in fermionic systems coupled to background
gauge and gravitational fields on odd-dimensional spacetimes. We use the extension of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer
index theorem to manifolds with corners due to Loya and Melrose to explicitly construct an extended
invertible field theory encoding the anomaly. This allows us to compute explicitly the 2-cocycle
of the projective representation of the gauge symmetry on the quantum state space. As a second application,
we study discrete symmetries of Dijkgraaf-Witten theories and their gauging. Non-abelian group
cohomology is used to describe discrete symmetries and we derive concrete conditions for such a
symmetry to admit 't Hooft anomalies in terms of the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.
We give an explicit realization of a discrete gauge theory with 't Hooft anomaly as a state on the boundary
of a higher-dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.
