Characterizing states of matter through the lens of their ergodic properties is a fascinating new
direction of research. In the quantum realm, the many-body localization (MBL) was proposed to be
the paradigmatic ergodicity breaking phenomenon, which extends the concept of Anderson localization
to interacting systems. At the same time, random matrix theory has established a powerful framework
for characterizing the onset of quantum chaos and ergodicity (or the absence thereof) in quantum
many-body systems. Here we numerically study the spectral statistics of disordered interacting
spin chains, which represent prototype models expected to exhibit MBL. We study the ergodicity
indicator $g=\log(t_{\rm H}/t_{\rm Th})$, which is defined through the ratio of two characteristic
many-body time scales, the Thouless time $t_{\rm Th}$ and the Heisenberg time $t_{\rm H}$, and hence
resembles the logarithm of the dimensionless conductance introduced in the context of Anderson
localization. We argue that the ergodicity breaking transition in interacting spin chains occurs
when both time scales are of the same order, $t_{\rm Th} \approx t_{\rm H}$, and $g$ becomes a system-size
independent constant. Hence, the ergodicity breaking transition in many-body systems carries
certain analogies with the Anderson localization transition. Intriguingly, using a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
correlation length we observe a scaling solution of $g$ across the transition, which allows for
detection of the crossing point in finite systems. We discuss the observation that scaled results
in finite systems by increasing the system size exhibit a flow towards the quantum chaotic regime.
