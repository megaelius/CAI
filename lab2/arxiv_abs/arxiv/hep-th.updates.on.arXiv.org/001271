We obtain new results on increasing, decreasing, and hill-shape sequences of real numbers by rational
functions and polynomials with positive integer coefficients in some generality. Unimodal sequences
have these sequences of real numbers. Then, polynomials give unimodal sequences by suitable log-concavities.
Also, rational functions extend polynomials. In this manuscript, we introduce a notion of merged-log-concavity
of rational functions and study the variation of unimodal sequences by polynomials with positive
integer coefficients. Loosely speaking, the merged-log-concavity of rational functions extends
Stanley's $q$-log-concavity of polynomials by Young diagrams and Euler's identities of $q$-Pochhammer
symbols. To develop a mathematical theory of the merged-log-concavity, we discuss positivities
of rational functions by order theory. Then, we give explicit merged-log-concave rational functions
by $q$-binomial coefficients, Hadamard products, and convolutions, extending the Cauchy-Binet
formula. Also, Young diagrams yield unimodal sequences by rational functions and the merged-log-concavity.
Then, we study the variation of these unimodal sequences by critical points, which are algebraic
varieties in a suitable setting. In particular, we extend $t$-power series of $q$-Pochhammer symbols
$(-t;q)_{\infty}$ and $(t;q)_{\infty}^{-1}$ in Euler's identities by the variation of unimodal
sequences and polynomials with positive integer coefficients. Also, we consider eta products
and quantum dilogarithms. This gives the golden ratio of quantum dilogarithms as a critical point.
In statistical mechanics, we discuss grand canonical partition functions of some ideal boson-fermion
gases with or without Casimir energies (Ramanujan summation). This gives statistical-mechanical
phase transitions by the mathematical theory of the merged-log-concavity and critical points
such as the golden ratio.
