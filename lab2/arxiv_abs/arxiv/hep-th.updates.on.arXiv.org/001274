Using our framework of the quantum separation of variables (SoV) for higher rank quantum integrable
lattice models [1], we introduce some foundations to go beyond the obtained complete transfer matrix
spectrum description and open the way to compute matrix elements of local operators. This first
amounts to obtain simple expressions for scalar products of the so-called separate states, i.e.
transfer matrix eigenstates or some simple generalization of them. In the higher rank case (to explain
our method and for simplicity we will restrict here to the rank two), our standard co-vector/vector
separation of variables bases are shown to satisfy some \textit{pseudo-orthogonality} relations
and their non-zero couplings are exactly characterized. While the corresponding \textit{SoV-measure}
stays reasonably simple and of possible practical use, we then address the problem to construct
co-vector/vector SoV bases which moreover satisfy standard orthogonality. In our approach, the
separation of variables bases are constructed by using families of conserved charges. This gives
us a large freedom in the SoV bases construction which allows us to look for the choice of the family
of conserved charges which leads to orthogonal co-vector/vector SoV bases. We first define such
a choice in the case of twist matrices having simple spectrum and zero determinant. Then we generalize
the associated family of conserved charges and orthogonal SoV bases to generic simple spectrum
and invertible twist matrices. Under this choice of conserved charges, and of the associated orthogonal
SoV bases, the scalar products of separate states simplify considerably and take a form similar
to the rank one case.
