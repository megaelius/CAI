In this work we introduce a new theoretical framework for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity,
which results to particularly elegant, functionally simple and transparent gravitational equations
of motion, slow-roll indices and the corresponding observational indices. The main requirement
is that the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory has to be compatible with the GW170817 event, so the gravitational
wave speed $c_T^2$ is required to be $c_T^2\simeq 1$ in natural units. This assumption was also made
in a previous work of ours, but in this work we express all the related quantities as functions of the
scalar field. The constraint $c_T^2\simeq 1$ restricts the functional form of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet
coupling function $\xi(\phi)$ and of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$, which must satisfy a differential
equation. However, by also assuming that the slow-roll conditions hold true, the resulting equations
of motion and the slow-roll indices acquire particularly simple forms, and also the relation that
yields the $e$-foldings number is $N=\int_{\phi_i}^{\phi_f}\xi''/\xi'd \phi$, a fact that enables
us to perform particularly simple calculations in order to study the inflationary phenomenological
implications of several models. As it proves, the models we presented are compatible with the observational
data, and also satisfy all the assumptions made during the process of extracting the gravitational
equations of motion. More interestingly, we also investigated the phenomenological implications
of an additional condition $\xi'/\xi''\ll 1$, which is motivated by the slow-roll conditions that
are imposed on the scalar field evolution and on the Hubble rate, in which case the study is easier.
Our approach opens a new window in viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity.
