Using modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm we reconstruct the primordial power spectrum (PPS)
from Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy data. In our analysis we
use different combinations of angular power spectra from Planck to reconstruct the shape of the
primordial power spectrum and locate possible features. Performing an extensive error analysis
we found the dip near $\ell\sim750-850$ represents the most prominent feature in the data. Feature
near $\ell\sim1800-2000$ is detectable with high confidence only in 217 GHz spectrum and is apparently
consequence of a small systematic as described in the revised Planck 2013 papers. Fixing the background
cosmological parameters and the foreground nuisance parameters to their best fit baseline values,
we report that the best fit power law primordial power spectrum is consistent with the reconstructed
form of the PPS at 2$\sigma$ C.L. of the estimated errors (apart from the local features mentioned
above). As a consistency test, we found the reconstructed primordial power spectrum from Planck
temperature data can also substantially improve the fit to WMAP-9 angular power spectrum data (with
respect to power-law form of the PPS) allowing an overall amplitude shift of $\sim2.5\%$. In this
context low-$\ell$ and 100 GHz spectrum from Planck which have proper overlap in the multipole range
with WMAP data found to be completely consistent with WMAP-9 (allowing amplitude shift). As another
important result of our analysis we do report the evidence of gravitational lensing through the
reconstruction analysis. Finally we present two smooth form of the PPS containing only the important
features. These smooth forms of PPS can provide significant improvements in fitting the data (with
respect to the power law PPS) and can be helpful to give hints for inflationary model building.
