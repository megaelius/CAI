In a previous work we suggested a self-gravitating electromagnetic monopole solution in a string-inspired
model involving global spontaneous breaking of a $SO(3)$ internal symmetry and Kalb-Ramond (KR)
axions, stemming from an antisymmetric tensor field in the massless string multiplet. These axions
carry a charge, which, in our model, also plays the r\^ole of the magnetic charge. The resulting geometry
is close to that of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole with charge proportional to the KR-axion
charge. We proposed the existence of a thin shell structure inside a (large) core radius as the dominant
mass contribution to the energy functional. The resulting energy was finite, and proportional
to the KR-axion charge; however, the size of the shell was not determined and left as a phenomenological
parameter. In the current article, we can calculate the mass-shell size, on proposing a regularisation
of the black hole singularity via a matching procedure between the RN metric in the outer region and,
in the inner region, a de Sitter space with a (positive) cosmological constant proportional to the
scale of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of $SO(3)$ . The matching, which involves the Israel
junction conditions for the metric and its first derivatives at the inner surface of the shell, determines
the inner mass-shell radius. The axion charge plays an important r\^ole in guaranteeing positivity
of the "mass coefficient" of the gravitational potential term appearing in the metric component;
so the KR electromagnetic monopole shows normal attractive gravitational effects. This is to be
contrasted with the global monopole case (in the absence of KR axions) where such a matching is known
to yield a negative "mass coefficient" (and, hence, repulsive gravitational effects). The total
energy of the monopole within the shell is calculated.
