This paper presents a detailed description of the CamSpec likelihood which has been used to analyse
Planck temperature and polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background since the first Planck
data release. We have created a number of likelihoods using a range of Galactic sky masks and different
methods of temperature foreground cleaning. Our most powerful likelihood uses 80 percent of the
sky in temperature and polarization. Our results show that the six-parameter LCDM cosmology provides
an excellent fit to the Planck data. There is no evidence for statistically significant internal
tensions in the Planck TT, TE and EE spectra computed for different frequency combinations. We present
evidence that the tendencies for the Planck temperature power spectra to favour a lensing amplitude
A_L>1 and positive spatial curvature are caused by statistical fluctuations in the temperature
power spectra. Using our statistically most powerful likelihood, we find that the A_L parameter
differs from unity at no more than the 2.2 sigma level. We find no evidence for anomalous shifts in
cosmological parameters with multipole range. In fact, we show that the combined TTTEEE likelihood
over the restricted multipole range 2-800 gives cosmological parameters for the base LCDM cosmology
that are very close to those derived from the full multipole range 2-2500. We present revised constraints
on a few extensions of the base LCDM cosmology, focussing on the sum of neutrino masses, number of
relativistic species and the tensor-scalar ratio. The results presented here show that the Planck
data are remarkably consistent between detector-sets, frequencies and sky area. We find no evidence
in our analysis that cosmological parameters determined from the CamSpec likelihood are affected
to any significant degree by systematic errors in the Planck data (abridged).
