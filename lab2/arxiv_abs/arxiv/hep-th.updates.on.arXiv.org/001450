We compare light-front quantization and instant-time quantization both at the level of operators
and at the level of their Feynman diagram matrix elements. At the level of operators light-front
quantization and instant-time quantization lead to equal light-front time commutation (or anticommutation)
relations that appear to be quite different from equal instant-time commutation (or anticommutation)
relations. Despite this we show that at unequal times instant-time and light-front commutation
(or anticommutation) relations actually can be transformed into each other, with it only being
the restriction to equal times that makes the commutation (or anticommutation) relations appear
to be so different. While our results are valid for both bosons and fermions, for fermions there are
subtleties associated with tip of the light cone contributions that need to be taken care of. At the
level of Feynman diagrams we show for non-vacuum Feynman diagrams that the pole terms in four-dimensional
light-front Feynman diagrams reproduce the three-dimensional light-front on-shell Hamiltonian
Fock space formulation in which the light-front energy and light-front momentum are on shell. However,
because of circle at infinity contributions we show that this equivalence fails for four-dimensional
light-front vacuum tadpole diagrams. Then, precisely because of these circle at infinity contributions,
light-front vacuum tadpole diagrams are not only nonzero, they are actually equal to instant-time
vacuum tadpole diagrams. Light-front vacuum diagrams are not correctly describable by the on-shell
Hamiltonian formalism, and thus not by the closely related infinite momentum frame prescription
either. With the transformation from instant-time fields to light-front fields being a spacetime
translation, not only are instant-time quantization and light-front quantization equivalent,
they are unitarily equivalent.
