Following Pasterski-Shao-Strominger we construct a new basis of states in the single-particle
Hilbert space of massless particles as a linear combination of standard Wigner states. Under Lorentz
transformation the new basis states transform in the Unitary Principal Continuous Series representation.
These states are obtained if we consider the little group of a null momentum \textit{direction}
rather than a null momentum. The definition of the states in terms of the Wigner states makes it easier
to study the action of space-time translation in this basis. We show by taking into account the effect
of space-time translation that \textit{the dynamics of massless particles described by these
states takes place completely on the null-infinity of the Minkowski space}. We then second quantize
the theory in this basis and obtain a unitary manifestly Poincare invariant (field) theory of free
massless particles living on null-infinity. The null-infinity arises in this case purely group-theoretically
without any reference to bulk space-time. Action of BMS on massless particles is natural in this
picture. As a by-product we generalize the conformal primary wave-functions for massless particles
in a way which makes the action of space-time translation simple. Using these wave-functions we
write down a modified Mellin(-Fourier) transformation of the S-matrix elements. The resulting
amplitude is Poincare covariant. Under Poincare transformation it transforms like products of
primaries of inhomogeneous $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ ($ISL(2,\mathbb{C})$) inserted at various points
of null-infinity. $ISL(2,\mathbb{C})$ primaries are defined in the paper.
