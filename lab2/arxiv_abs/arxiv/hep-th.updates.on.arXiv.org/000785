We study finite group actions that are parametrised by coloured graphs, as the basis of the graph
calculus. In this setting, a derivative with respect to a certain graph yields its respective group
action. The graph calculus is built on a suitable quotient of the monoid algebra $A[G]$ corresponding
to a certain function space $A$ and the free monoid $G$ in finitely many graph variables. The largest
section is dedicated solely to these algebraic structures, which, although motivated by Tensor
Field Theory (TFT), are introduced and dealt with without reference to it. These abstract results
are subsequently applied to a TFT problem: Tensor field theory focuses on quantum field theory aspects
of random tensor models, a quantum-gravity-motivated generalisation of random matrix models.
The correlation functions of complex tensor models have a rich combinatorial structure: they are
classified by boundary graphs that describe the geometry of the boundary states. These graphs can
be disconnected, although the correlation functions are themselves connected. In a recent work,
the Schwinger-Dyson equations for an arbitrary albeit connected boundary were obtained. Here,
we use a graph calculus---where derivatives of graphs yield group actions by their coloured automorphism---in
order to report on the missing equations for correlation functions with disconnected boundary,
thus completing the Schwinger-Dyson pyramid for quartic melonic ('pillow'-vertices) in arbitrary
rank. We hope that the present result sheds light on the non-perturbative large-$N$ limit of tensor
field theories. Moreover, we presume that it can be interesting if one addresses the solvability
of the theory by using methods that generalise the topological recursion to the tensor field theory
setting.
