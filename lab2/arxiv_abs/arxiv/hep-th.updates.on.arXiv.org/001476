We have recently proposed a new matrix dynamics at the Planck scale, building on the theory of trace
dynamics. This is a Lagrangian dynamics in which the matrix degrees of freedom are made from Grassmann
numbers, and the Lagrangian is trace of a matrix polynomial. Matrices made from even grade elements
of the Grassmann algebra are called bosonic, and those made from odd grade elements are called fermionic:
together they describe an `aikyon'. In the present article we provide a basic definition of spin
angular momentum in this matrix dynamics, and introduce a bosonic(fermionic) configuration variable
conjugate to the spin of a boson(fermion). We then show that at energies below Planck scale, where
the matrix dynamics reduces to quantum theory, fermions have half-integer spin (in multiples of
Planck's constant), and bosons have integral spin. We also show that this definition of spin agrees
with the conventional understanding of spin in relativistic quantum mechanics. Consequently,
we obtain an elementary proof for the spin-statistics connection. We then motivate why an octonionic
space is the natural space in which an aikyon evolves. The group of automorphisms in this space is
the exceptional Lie group $G_2$ which has fourteen generators [could they stand for the twelve vector
bosons and two d.o.f. of the graviton ?]. The aikyon also resembles a closed string, and it has been
suggested in the literature that 10-D string theory can be represented as a 2-D string in the 8-D octonionic
space. From the work of Cohl Furey and others it is known that the Dixon algebra made from the four division
algebras [real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions] can possibly describe the
symmetries of the standard model. In the present paper we outline how in our work the Dixon algebra
arises naturally, and could lead to a unification of gravity with the standard model.
