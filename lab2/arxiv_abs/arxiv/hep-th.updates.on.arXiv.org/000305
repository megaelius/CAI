Bodies coupled to electromagnetic or other long-range fields are subject to radiation reaction
and other effects in which their own fields can influence their motion. Self-force phenomena such
as these have been poorly understood for spacetime dimensions not equal to four, despite the relevance
of differing dimensionalities for holographic duals, effectively two-dimensional condensed
matter and fluid systems, and so on. We remedy this by showing that forces and torques acting on extended
electromagnetic charges in all dimensions $d \geq 3$ have the same functional form as the usual test
body expressions, except that the electromagnetic field appearing in those expressions is not
the physical one; it is an effective surrogate. For arbitrary even $d \geq 4$, our surrogate field
locally satisfies the source-free field equations, and is conceptually very similar to what arises
in the Detweiler-Whiting prescription previously established when $d=4$. The odd-dimensional
case is different, involving effective fields which are not necessarily source-free. Moreover,
we find a 1-parameter family of natural effective fields for each odd $d$, where the free parameter--a
lengthscale--is degenerate with (finite) renormalizations of a body's stress-energy tensor.
While different parameter choices can result in different forces, they do so without affecting
physical observables. Having established these general results, explicit point-particle self-forces
are derived in odd-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes. Simple examples are discussed for $d=3$
and $d=5$, one of which illustrates that the particularly slow decay of fields in three spacetime
dimensions results in particles creating their own "preferred rest frames:" Initially-static
charges which are later perturbed have a strong tendency to return to rest. Our results easily extend
also to the scalar and gravitational self-force problems.
