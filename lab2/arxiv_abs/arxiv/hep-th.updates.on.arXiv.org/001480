We consider different scenarios of the evolution of the universe, where the singularities or some
non-analyticities in the geometry of the spacetime are present, trying to answer the following
question: is it possible to conserve some kind of notion of particle corresponding to a chosen quantum
field present in the universe when the latter approaches the singularity? We study scalar fields
with different types of Lagrangians, writing down the second-order differential equations for
the linear perturbations of these fields in the vicinity of a singularity. If both independent solutions
are regular, we construct the vacuum state for quantum particles as a Gaussian function of the corresponding
variable. If at least one of two independent solutions has a singular asymptotic behavior, then
we cannot define the creation and the annihilation operators and construct the vacuum. This means
that the very notion of particle loses sense. We show that at the approaching to the Big Rip singularity,
particles corresponding to the phantom scalar field driving the evolution of the universe must
vanish, while particles of other fields still can be defined. In the case of the model of the universe
described by the tachyon field with a special trigonometric potential, where the Big Brake singularity
occurs, we see that the (pseudo) tachyon particles do not pass through this singularity. Adding
to this model some quantity of dust, we slightly change the characteristics of this singularity
and tachyon particles survive. Finally, we consider a model with the scalar field with the cusped
potential, where the phantom divide line crossing occurs. Here the particles are well defined in
the vicinity of this crossing point.
