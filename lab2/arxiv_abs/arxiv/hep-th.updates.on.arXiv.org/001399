We reanalyze and expand upon models proposed in 2015 for linear dilaton black holes, and use them
to test several speculative ideas about black hole physics. We examine ideas based on the definition
of quantum extremal surfaces in quantum field theory in curved space-time. The low energy effective
field theory of our model is the large N CGHS model, which includes the one loop effects that are taken
into account in the "island" proposal for understanding the Page curve. Contrary to the results
of the island analysis, that solution leads to a singular geometry for the evaporated black hole.
If the singularity obeys Cosmic Censorship then Hawking evaporation leaves behind a remnant object
with a finite fraction of the black hole entropy. If the singularity becomes naked at some point,
boundary conditions on a time-like line emanating from that point can produce a sensible model where
we expect a Page curve. We show that the fully UV complete model gives a correct Page curve, as it must
since the model is manifestly unitary. Recent result on replicawormholes suggest that the island
formula, which appears to involve only one loop computations, in fact encodes non-perturbative
contributions to the gravitational path integral. The question of why Euclidean gravity computations
can capture information about microscopic states of quantum gravity remains mysterious. In a speculative
coda to the paper we suggest that the proper way of understanding the relation between Euclidean
gravity path integrals and quantum spectra is via a statistical approach to Jacobson's interpretation
of general relativistic field equations as the hydrodynamic equations of the area law for the maximal
entropy of causal diamonds.
