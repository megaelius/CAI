This work discusses observational evidences of quantum effects on geometry in a black hole (BH)
astrophysical context. We study properties of a family of loop quantum corrected regular BH solutions
and their horizons, focusing on the geometry symmetries. We explore a recent model where the geometry
is determined by a metric quantum modification outside the horizon: a regular static spherical
solution of minisuperspace BH metric with Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) corrections. The solutions
are characterized by some polymeric functions and the emergence of a singularity in the limiting
Schwarzschild geometry. We discuss particular metric solutions for similar properties of structures,
the metric Killing bundles (metric bundles MBs), related to the BH horizons properties. A comparison
with the Reissner-Nordstrom geometry and the Kerr geometry, similar for their respective MBs properties
is done. The analysis provides a way to recognize these geometries and detect phenomenological
evidence of LQG origin by the detection of stationary/static observers and the properties of lightlike
orbits with the analysis of the conformal invariant MBs related to the (local) causal structure.
This approach could be applied in other quantum corrected BH solutions constraining the characteristics
of the underlining LQG-graph, as the minimal loop area, through photons detection. Light surfaces
associated with a diversified range of BH phenomenology and grounding MB definition provide a research
channel of possible astrophysical evidence. The BHs thermodynamic characteristics are studied,
luminosity, surface gravity, and temperature. Ultimately the application of this method to this
spherically symmetric approximate solution provides a way to clarify some formal aspects of MBs
in the presence of static spherical symmetric spacetimes.
