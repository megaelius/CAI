To characterize fluctuations in a turbulent flow, one usually studies different moments of velocity
increments and dissipation rate, $\overline{(v(x+r)-v(x))^{n}}\propto r^{\zeta_{n}}$ and
$\overline{{\cal E}^{n}}\propto Re^{d_{n}}$, respectively. In high Reynolds number flows,
the moments of different orders cannot be simply related to each other which is the signature of anomalous
scaling, one of the most puzzling features of turbulent flows. High-order moments are related to
extreme, rare events and our ability to quantitatively describe them is crucially important for
meteorology, heat, mass transfer and other applications. In this work we present a solution to this
problem in the particular case of the Navier-Stokes equations driven by a random force. A novel aspect
of this work is that, unlike previous efforts which aimed at seeking solutions around the infinite
Reynolds number limit, we concentrate on the vicinity of transitional Reynolds numbers $Re^{tr}$
where the first emergence of anomalous scaling is observed out of a low-$Re$ Gaussian background.
The obtained closed expressions for anomalous scaling exponents $\zeta_{n}$ and $d_{n}$, which
depend on the transition Reynolds number, agree well with experimental and numerical data in the
literature and, when $n\gg 1$, $d_{n}\approx 0.19n \ln(n)$. The theory yields the energy spectrum
$E(k)\propto k^{-\zeta_{2}-1}$ with $\zeta_{2}\approx 0.699$, different from the outcome of
Kolmogorov's theory. It is also argued that fluctuations of dissipation rate and those of the transition
point itself are responsible for both, deviation from Gaussian statistics and multiscaling of
velocity field.
