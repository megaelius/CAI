In this work we study classical bouncing solutions in the context of $f({\sf R},{\sf T})={\sf R}+h({\sf
T})$ gravity in a flat {\sf FLRW} background using a perfect fluid as the only matter content. Our
investigation is based on introducing an effective fluid through defining effective energy density
and pressure; we call this reformulation as the \lq\lq{}{\it effective picture}\rq\rq{}. These
definitions have been already introduced to study the energy conditions in $f({\sf R},{\sf T})$
gravity. We examine various models to which different effective equations of state, corresponding
to different $h({\sf T})$ functions, can be attributed. It is also discussed that one can link between
an assumed $f({\sf R},{\sf T})$ model in the effective picture and the theories with generalized
equation of state ({\sf EoS}). We obtain cosmological scenarios exhibiting a nonsingular bounce
before and after which the Universe lives within a de-Sitter phase. We then proceed to find general
solutions for matter bounce and investigate their properties. We show that the properties of bouncing
solution in the effective picture of $f({\sf R},{\sf T})$ gravity are as follows: for a specific
form of the $f({\sf R,T})$ function, these solutions are without any future singularities and are
stable against Dolgov-Kawasaki perturbation and also are ghost free. It is possible that all energy
conditions be respected by the real perfect fluid, however, the null and the strong energy conditions
can be violated by the effective fluid near the bounce event. These solutions always correspond
to a maximum in the real matter energy density and a vanishing minimum in the effective density. The
effective pressure varies between negative values and may show either a minimum or a maximum.
