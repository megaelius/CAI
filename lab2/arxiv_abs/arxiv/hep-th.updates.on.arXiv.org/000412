A quantum system of particles can exist in a localized phase, exhibiting ergodicity breaking and
maintaining forever a local memory of its initial conditions. We generalize this concept to a system
of extended objects, such as strings and membranes, arguing that such a system can also exhibit localization
in the presence of sufficiently strong disorder (randomness) in the Hamiltonian. We show that localization
of large extended objects can be mapped to a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem.
For example, motion of a string involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep
the different segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all such internal
modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the localization of the entire string.
The eigenstates of the system can then be constructed perturbatively through a convergent 'string
locator expansion.' We propose a type of out-of-time-order string correlator as a diagnostic of
such a string localized phase. Localization of other higher-dimensional objects, such as membranes,
can also be studied through a hierarchical construction by mapping onto localization of lower-dimensional
objects. Our arguments are 'asymptotic' (i.e. valid up to rare regions) but they extend the notion
of localization (and localization protected order) to a host of settings where such ideas previously
did not apply. These include high-dimensional ferromagnets with domain wall excitations, three-dimensional
topological phases with loop-like excitations, and three-dimensional type-II superconductors
with flux line excitations. In type-II superconductors, localization of flux lines could stabilize
superconductivity at energy densities where a normal state would arise in thermal equilibrium.
