Every conformal field theory (CFT) above two dimensions contains an infinite set of Regge trajectories
of local operators which, at large spin, asymptote to "double-twist" composites with vanishing
anomalous dimension. In two dimensions, due to the existence of local conformal symmetry, this
and other central results of the conformal bootstrap do not apply. We incorporate exact stress tensor
dynamics into the CFT$_2$ analytic bootstrap, and extract several implications for AdS$_3$ quantum
gravity. Our main tool is the Virasoro fusion kernel, which we newly analyze and interpret in the
bootstrap context. The contribution to double-twist data from the Virasoro vacuum module defines
a "Virasoro Mean Field Theory" (VMFT), its spectrum includes a finite number of discrete Regge trajectories,
whose dimensions obey a simple formula exact in the central charge $c$ and external operator dimensions.
We then show that VMFT provides a baseline for large spin universality in two dimensions: in every
unitary compact CFT$_2$ with $c > 1$ and a twist gap above the vacuum, the double-twist data approaches
that of VMFT at large spin $\ell$. Corrections to the large spin spectrum from individual non-vacuum
primaries are exponentially small in $\sqrt{\ell}$ for fixed $c$. We analyze our results in various
large $c$ limits. Further applications include a derivation of the late-time behavior of Virasoro
blocks at generic $c$, a refined understanding and new derivation of heavy-light blocks, and the
determination of the cross-channel limit of generic Virasoro blocks. We deduce non-perturbative
results about the bound state spectrum and dynamics of quantum gravity in AdS$_3$.
