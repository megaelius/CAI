The formalism of Holographic Space-time (HST) is a translation of the principles of Lorentzian
geometry into the language of quantum information. Intervals along time-like trajectories, and
their associated causal diamonds, completely characterize a Lorentzian geometry. The Bekenstein-Hawking-Gibbons-'t
Hooft-Jacobson-Fischler-Susskind-Bousso Covariant Entropy Principle, equates the logarithm
of the dimension of the Hilbert space associated with a diamond to one quarter of the area of the diamond's
holographic screen, measured in Planck units. The most convincing argument for this principle
is Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's equations as the hydrodynamic expression of this entropy
law. In that context, the null energy condition (NEC) is seen to be the analog of the local law of entropy
increase. The quantum version of Einstein's relativity principle is a set of constraints on the
mutual quantum information shared by causal diamonds along different time-like trajectories.
The implementation of this constraint for trajectories in relative motion is the greatest unsolved
problem in HST. The other key feature of HST is its claim that, for non-negative cosmological constant
or causal diamonds much smaller than the asymptotic radius of curvature for negative c.c., the degrees
of freedom localized in the bulk of a diamond are constrained states of variables defined on the holographic
screen. This principle gives a simple explanation of otherwise puzzling features of BH entropy
formulae, and resolves the firewall problem for black holes in Minkowski space. It motivates a covariant
version of the CKN\cite{ckn} bound on the regime of validity of quantum field theory (QFT) and a detailed
picture of the way in which QFT emerges as an approximation to the exact theory.
