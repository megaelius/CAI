Modular localization is the concise conceptual formulation of causal localization in the setting
of local quantum physics. Unlike QM it does not refer to individual operators but rather to ensembles
of observables which share the same localization region, as a result it explains the probabilistic
aspects of QFT in terms of the impure KMS nature arising from the local restriction of the pure vacuum.
Whereas it played no important role in the perturbation theory of low spin particles, it becomes
indispensible for interactions which involve higher spin s fields, where is leads to the replacement
of the operator (BRST) gauge theory setting in Krein space by a new formulation in terms of stringlocal
fields in Hilbert space. The main purpose of this paper is to present new results which lead to a rethinking
of important issues of the Standard Model concerning massive gauge theories and the Higgs mechanism.
We place these new findings into the broader context of ongoing conceptual changes within QFT which
already led to new nonperturbative constructions of models of integrable QFTs. It is also pointed
out that modular localization does not support ideas coming from string theory, as extra dimensions
and Kaluza Klein dimensional reductions outside quasiclassical approximations. Apart from hologarphic
projections on null-surfaces, holograhic relations between QFT in different spacetime dimensions
violate the causal completeness property, this includes in particular the Maldacena conjecture.
Last not least, modular localization sheds light onto unsolved problems from QFT's distant past
since it reveals that the Einstein-Jordan conundrum is really an early harbinger of the Unruh effect.
