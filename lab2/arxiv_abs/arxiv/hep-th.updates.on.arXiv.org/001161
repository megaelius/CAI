The covariant Noether charge formalism (also known as the covariant phase method) of Wald and collaborators,
including its cohomological extension, is a manifestly covariant Hamiltonian formalism that,
in principle, allows one to define and compute the energy, angular momenta, and chemical potentials
of generic solutions of gravitational theories. However, it has been observed that for some supergravity
solutions the variation of the Noether charge is not (at least manifestably) integrable, and as
a result it is unclear whether there are well-defined thermodynamic charges for these solutions.
In this work, we derive an expression for the variation of the covariant Noether charges for any solution
of Type IIB 10-dimensional supergravity or 11-dimensional supergravity. Although this Noether
quantity is not integrable in general, we show that for asymptotically scale-invariant solutions,
it is. In particular, the asymptotic scale-invariance allows one to define an energy density and
conjugate chemical potentials which obey a first law of thermodynamics and a Smarr relation. These
two thermodynamic relations can then be shown to imply that the variation of the Noether charge is
integrable, and accordingly the energy and other thermodynamic charges may be defined unambiguously.
We explicitly demonstrate and illustrate our claim by computing the thermodynamic charges of two
non-trivial supergravity solutions that were recently constructed: 1) the Polchinski-Strassler
black brane that is dual to the deconfined phase of $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theory, and 2) the CGLP black
brane that asymptotes to the mass deformed Cveti\v{c}-Gibbons-L\"u-Pope (CGLP) solution.
