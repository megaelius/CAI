Coulomb interactions famously drive three dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals into
a non-Fermi liquid phase of matter. In a previous work, Phys. Rev. B 95, 205106 (2017) the effect of
disorder on this non-Fermi liquid phase was investigated, assuming that the bandstructure was
particle-hole symmetric and isotropic, and assuming that the disorder preserved exact time-reversal
symmetry and statistical isotropy. It was shown that the non-Fermi liquid fixed point is unstable
to disorder, and that a runaway flow to strong disorder occurs. In this work, we extend that analysis
by relaxing the twin assumptions of time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry (but continuing
to assume isotropy of the low energy bandstructure). We first incorporate time-reversal symmetry
breaking disorder, and demonstrate that there do not appear any new fixed points. Moreover, while
the system continues to flow to strong disorder, time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder grows
asymptotically more slowly than time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder, which we therefore
expect should dominate the strong-coupling phase. We then introduce a perturbation that breaks
the particle-hole symmetry of the bandstructure. We show that whereas this perturbation is irrelevant
in the clean system, it is relevant in the presence of disorder, such that the `effective masses'
of the conduction and valence bands should become sharply distinct in the low-energy limit. We calculate
the RG flow equations for the disordered interacting system in the presence of particle-hole symmetry
breaking in the bandstructure, and demonstrate that the problem exhibits a runaway flow to strong
disorder. Along the runaway flow, time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder grows asymptotically
more rapidly than both time-reversal-symmetry-breaking disorder and the Coulomb interaction.
