A number of problems in physics, mathematics, and philosophy involve observers in given situations
which lead to debates about whether observer-specific information should affect the probability
for some outcome or hypothesis. Our purpose is *not* to advocate for such observer selection effects,
rather to show that any such effects depend greatly on the assumptions made. We focus on the debate
about the existence of a 'Doomsday effect'---whether observer index information should cause
one to favor possibilities with fewer observers, which has been argued to have implications for
models of cosmology. Our central goal is to reconcile the apparent inconsistencies in the literature
by introducing a formalism to lay bare assumptions made and address a key issue that has been glossed
over in such problems: whether the observer is selected by *picking from* or *being in* a set of worlds.
In the former there generally are observer selection effects, in the latter there generally are
not. This leads us to differentiate what we call *inclusive* from *exclusive* selection, and how
they relate to the concept of a multiverse. Then we relax the assumption that all observers are equally
typical, and consider the problem of Boltzmann brains, showing that typicality can play a role in
solving the problem. We then stress the need for scale-invariant questions, which causes us to analyze
J. Richard Gott's approach to the problem. This all allows us to analyze the Doomsday and Universal
Doomsday arguments. We find that there is no Doomsday effect, absent a set of assumptions we find
somewhat unreasonable. Then we use our formalism to resolve a debate in the philosophy community
called the 'Sleeping Beauty Problem.' Finally, we conclude with a heuristic summary, free from
equations, and point to possible future directions of this line of research.
