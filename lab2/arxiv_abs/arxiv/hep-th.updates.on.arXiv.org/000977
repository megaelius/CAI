Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to free, massive, classical fundamental fields admits particle-like
solutions. These are asymptotically flat, everywhere non-singular configurations that realise
Wheeler's concept of a geon: a localised lump of self-gravitating energy whose existence is anchored
on the non-linearities of general relativity, trivialising in the flat spacetime limit. In arXiv:1708.05674
the key properties for the existence of these solutions (also referred to as stars or self-gravitating
solitons) were discussed - which include a harmonic time dependence in the matter field -, and a comparative
analysis of the stars arising in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon, Einstein-Dirac and Einstein-Proca
models was performed, for the particular case of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. In
the present work we generalise this analysis for spinning solutions. In particular, the spinning
Einstein-Dirac stars are reported here for the first time. Our analysis shows that the high degree
of universality observed in the spherical case remains when angular momentum is allowed. Thus,
as classical field theory solutions, these self-gravitating solitons are rather insensitive
to the fundamental fermionic or bosonic nature of the corresponding field, displaying similar
features. We describe some physical properties and, in particular, we observe that the angular
momentum of the spinning stars satisfies the quantisation condition $J=m N,$ for all models, where
$N$ is the particle number and $m$ is an integer for the bosonic fields and a half-integer for the Dirac
field. The way in which this quantisation condition arises, however, is more subtle for the non-zero
spin fields.
