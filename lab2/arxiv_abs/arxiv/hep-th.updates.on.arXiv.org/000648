General quantum gravity arguments predict that Lorentz symmetry might not hold exactly in nature.
This has motivated much interest in Lorentz breaking gravity theories recently. Among such models
are vector-tensor theories with preferred direction established at every point of spacetime by
a fixed-norm vector field. The dynamical vector field defined in this way is referred to as the \textquotedblleft
aether." In this paper, we put forward the idea of a \textit{null} aether field and introduce, for
the first time, the Null Aether Theory (NAT)--a vector-tensor theory \textit{with a preferred
null direction} at each spacetime point. We first study the Newtonian limit of this theory and then
construct exact spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the theory in four dimensions, which
contain Vaidya-type non-static solutions and static Schwarzschild-(A)dS type solutions, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-(A)dS
type solutions and solutions of conformal gravity as special cases. Afterwards, we study the cosmological
solutions in NAT: We find some exact solutions with perfect fluid distribution for spatially flat
FLRW metric and null aether propagating along the $x$ direction. We observe that there are solutions
in which the universe has big-bang singularity and null field diminishes asymptotically. We also
study exact gravitational wave solutions--AdS-plane waves and $pp$-waves--in this theory in
any dimension $D\geq3$. Assuming the Kerr-Schild-Kundt class of metrics for such solutions, we
show that the full field equations of the theory are reduced to two, in general coupled, differential
equations when the background metric assumes the maximally symmetric form. The main conclusion
of these computations is that the spin-0 aether field acquires a \textquotedblleft mass" determined
by the cosmological constant of the background spacetime and the Lagrange multiplier given in the
theory.
