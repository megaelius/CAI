In this paper we dwell on three issues: 1) revisit the relation between vacuum fluctuations and radiation
reaction in atom-field interactions, which began in the 70s and settled in the 90s with its resolution
recorded in monographs; 2) the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) of the system, pointing
out the differences between that in linear response theory (LRT) assuming ultra-weak coupling
between the system and the bath, and the FDR in an equilibrated final state, relaxed from the nonequilibrium
evolution of an open quantum system; 3) quantum radiation from an atom interacting with a quantum
field: Begin with vacuum fluctuations in the field acting on the internal degrees of freedom (idf)
of an atom, adding to its dynamics a stochastic component which engenders quantum radiation whose
backreaction causes quantum dissipation in the idf of the atom. For a stationary atom, we show how
the absence of radiation results from complex cancellations, at a faraway observation point, of
the interference between emitted radiation from the atom and the local fluctuations in the free
field. We point out that the entity which enters into the duality relation with vacuum fluctuations
is not classical radiation reaction, but quantum dissipation. Finally, regarding Issue 2, for
systems with many atoms, the existence of a set of correlation-propagation relations shows how
the correlations between the atoms are related to the propagation of their mutual influence manifesting
in the quantum field. The CPR is absolutely crucial in keeping the balance of energy flows between
the constituents of the system, and between the system and its environment. Without the consideration
of this additional relation in tether with the FDR, dynamical self-consistency cannot be sustained.
Combination of these two sets of relations capture the physical essence of the interaction between
an atom and a quantum field.
