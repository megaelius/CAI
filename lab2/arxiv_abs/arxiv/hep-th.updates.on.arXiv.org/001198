In this thesis, we study a variety of phenomena in strongly coupled quantum field theories by performing
calculations in their gravitational duals. We compute entanglement entropy in a variety of holographic
systems, paying particular attention to its long-distance behaviour, characterised by a term
proportional to surface area. This term is known to decrease along Lorentz-invariant renormalisation
group flows, suggesting that it may count massless degrees of freedom. We find that more general
deformations may increase this area term, possibly indicating an enhanced number of long-distance
degrees of freedom. We observe a correlation between this enhancement and the emergence of new scaling
symmetry at long distances. Next, we study the spectrum of collective excitations in a holographic
model of a non-Fermi liquid. At high temperatures, the spectrum of collective excitations includes
hydrodynamic sound waves. As in similar models, we observe that sound-like modes also exist at low
temperatures. Such modes are known as holographic zero sound. We study the changing properties
of holographic zero sound and the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour at high temperatures as we
vary the parameters of the model. We find that for certain values of the parameters, the temperature-dependence
of holographic zero sound qualitatively resembles that of a normal Fermi liquid. Finally, we study
the entanglement entropy contribution of surface defects in a six-dimensional quantum field theory
of relevance to M-theory, which is a candidate theory of quantum gravity. We find that the entanglement
entropy does not montonically decrease along renormalisation group flows on these defects, ruling
it out as a potential measure of degrees of freedom. On the other hand, we find that two of the contributions
of the defect to the Weyl anomaly of the quantum field theory decrease along all of the flows that we
study.
