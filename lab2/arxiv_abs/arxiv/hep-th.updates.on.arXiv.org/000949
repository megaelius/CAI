We discuss 3d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric SU(N) and U(N) Chern-Simons-matter theories, with
$N_f$ matter superfields in the fundamental representation of SU(N) or U(N). In the large N 't Hooft
limit with fixed 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ these theories have one (for $N_f=1$) or two (for $N_f
> 1$) exactly marginal deformations in the superpotential. At finite N these couplings acquire
a beta function. We compute the beta function exactly for $\lambda=0$, at leading order in 1/N. For
$N_f=1$ we find four fixed points, one of which is triply-degenerate. We show that at large N there
are at most six fixed points for any $\lambda$, and conjecture that there are exactly six, with three
of them stable (including a point with enhanced $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry). The strong-weak
coupling dualities of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Chern-Simons-matter theories map each of these fixed points
to a dual one. We show that at large N the phase structure near each of the three stable fixed points
is different. For $N_f>1$ we analyze the fixed points at weak coupling, and we work out the action
of the strong-weak coupling duality on the marginal and relevant superpotential couplings at large
N (which was previously known only for $N_f=1$). In addition, we compute in these theories the 2-point
and 3-point functions of the lowest gauge-invariant singlet superfield at large N, for all values
of $\lambda$ and of the superpotential couplings, and use them to test the large N dualities. This
computation is one of the ingredients needed for a computation of the beta function at order 1/N for
all $\lambda$, which we leave for future work. We also discuss Chern-Simons-matter theories with
extra Hubbard-Stratonovich type singlet fields, and suggest dualities between them.
