There exists a clear physical motivation for theoretical studies of the vacuum instability related
to the production of electron-positron pairs from a vacuum due to strong external electric fields.
Various nonperturbative (with respect to the external fields) calculation methods were developed.
Some of these methods are based on possible exact solutions of the Dirac equation. Unfortunately,
there are only few cases when such solutions are known. Recently, an approximate but still nonperturbative
approach to treat the vacuum instability caused by slowly varying $t$-electric potential steps
(time dependent external fields that vanish as $|t|\rightarrow\infty$), which does not depend
on the existence of the corresponding exact solutions, was formulated in Ref. [S. P. Gavrilov, D.
M. Gitman, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{95}, 076013 (2017)]. Here, we present an approximate calculation
method to treat nonperturbatively the vacuum instability in arbitrary weakly inhomogeneous $x$-electric
potential steps (time-independent electric fields of a constant direction that are concentrated
in restricted space areas, which means that the fields vanish as $|x|\rightarrow\infty$) in the
absence of the corresponding exact solutions. Defining the weakly inhomogeneous regime in general
terms, we demonstrate the universal character of the vacuum instability. This universality is
associated with a large density of states excited from the vacuum by the electric field. Such a density
appears in our approach as a large parameter. We derive universal representations for the total
number and current density of the created particles. Relations of these representations with a
locally constant field approximation for Schwinger's effective action are found.
