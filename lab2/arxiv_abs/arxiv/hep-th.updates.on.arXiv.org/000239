By working in the generality of the singlet vertex operator algebras we connect several important
concepts in the theory of vertex operator algebras, quantum modular forms, and modular tensor categories.
More precisely, starting from explicit formulae for characters of modules over the singlet vertex
operator algebra, which can be expressed in terms of false theta functions and their derivatives,
we first deform these characters by using a complex parameter $\epsilon$. We then apply modular
transformation properties of regularised partial theta functions to study asymptotic behaviour
of regularised characters of irreducible modules and compute their regularised quantum dimensions.
We also give a purely geometric description of the regularisation parameter as a uniformisation
parameter of the fusion variety coming from atypical blocks. It turns out that the quantum dimensions
behave very differently depending on the sign of the real part of $\epsilon$. The map from the space
of characters equipped with the Verlinde product to the space of regularised quantum dimensions
turns out to be a genuine ring isomorphism for positive real part of $\epsilon$ while for negative
real part of $\epsilon$ its surjective image gives the fusion ring of a rational vertex operator
algebra. The category of modules of this rational vertex operator algebra should be viewed as obtained
through the process of a semi-simplification procedure widely used in the theory of quantum groups.
Interestingly, the modular tensor category structure constants of this vertex operator algebra,
can be also detected from vector valued quantum modular forms formed by distinguished atypical
characters.
