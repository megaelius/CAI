We study the scrambling of local quantum information in chaotic many-body systems in the presence
of a locally conserved quantity like charge or energy that moves diffusively. The interplay between
conservation laws and scrambling sheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics,
which is reversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative process. We
obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is constrained to have a conservation law.
We find that a generic spreading operator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises
the weight of the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is described
by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a source that steadily emits a flux
of (ii) non-conserved operators. This emission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics,
with the dissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local conserved operators
to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion current. The emitted nonconserved parts then
spread ballistically at a butterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially
non-observable, thereby acting as the "reservoir" that facilitates the dissipation. In addition,
we find that the nonconserved component develops a power law tail behind its leading ballistic front
due to the slow dynamics of the conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator
(OTOC) between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival of the ballistic
front but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws, it develops a diffusive tail and approaches
its asymptotic late-time value only as a power of time instead of exponentially. We also derive these
results within an effective hydrodynamic description which contains multiple coupled diffusion
equations.
