We study static, spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to Quadratic Gravity, extending considerably
our previous Rapid Communication [Phys. Rev. D 98, 021502(R) (2018)] on this topic. Using a conformal-to-Kundt
metric ansatz, we arrive at a much simpler form of the field equations in comparison with their expression
in the standard spherically symmetric coordinates. We present details of the derivation of this
compact form of two ordinary differential field equations for two metric functions. Next, we apply
analytical methods and express their solutions as infinite power series expansions. We systematically
derive all possible cases admitted by such an ansatz, arriving at six main classes of solutions,
and provide recurrent formulas for all the series coefficients. These results allow us to identify
the classes containing the Schwarzschild black hole as a special case. It turns out that one class
contains only the Schwarzschild black hole, three classes admit the Schwarzschild solution as
a special subcase, and two classes are not compatible with the Schwarzschild solution at all since
they have strictly nonzero Bach tensor. In our analysis, we naturally focus on the classes containing
the Schwarzschild spacetime, in particular on a new family of the Schwarzschild-Bach black holes
which possesses one additional non-Schwarzschild parameter corresponding to the value of the
Bach tensor invariant on the horizon. We study its geometrical and physical properties, such as
basic thermodynamical quantities and tidal effects on free test particles induced by the presence
of the Bach tensor. We also compare our results with previous findings in the literature obtained
using the standard spherically symmetric coordinates.
