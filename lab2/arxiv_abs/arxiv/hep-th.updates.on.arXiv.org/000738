We study the tunneling of virtual matter-antimatter pairs from the quantum vacuum in the presence
of a spatially uniform, time-dependent electric background composed of a strong, slow field superimposed
with a weak, rapid field. After analytic continuation to Euclidean spacetime, we obtain from the
instanton equations two critical points. While one of them is the closing point of the instanton
path, the other serves as an Euclidean mirror which reflects and squeezes the instanton. It is this
reflection and shrinking which is responsible for an enormous enhancement of the vacuum pair production
rate. We discuss how important features of two different mechanisms can be analysed and understood
via such a rotation in the complex plane. a) Consistent with previous studies, we first discuss the
standard assisted mechanism with a static strong field and certain weak fields with a distinct pole
structure in order to show that the reflection takes place exactly at the poles. We also discuss the
effect of possible sub-cycle structures. We extend this reflection picture then to weak fields
which have no poles present and illustrate the effective reflections with explicit examples. An
additional field strength dependence for the rate occurs in such cases. We analytically compute
the characteristic threshold for the assisted mechanism given by the critical combined Keldysh
parameter. We discuss significant differences between these two types of fields. For various backgrounds,
we present the contributing instantons and perform analytical computations for the corresponding
rates treating both fields nonperturbatively. b) In addition, we also study the case with a nonstatic
strong field which gives rise to the assisted dynamical mechanism. For different strong field profiles
we investigate the impact on the critical combined Keldysh parameter. [...]
