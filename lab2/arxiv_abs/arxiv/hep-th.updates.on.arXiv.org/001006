We construct quantum Separation of Variables (SoV) bases for both the fundamental inhomogeneous
$gl_{\mathcal{M}|\mathcal{N}}$ supersymmetric integrable models and for the inhomogeneous
Hubbard model both defined with quasi-periodic twisted boundary conditions given by twist matrices
having simple spectrum. The SoV bases are obtained by using the integrable structure of these quantum
models,i.e. the associated commuting transfer matrices, following the general scheme introduced
in [1]; namely, they are given by set of states generated by the multiple actions of the transfer matrices
on generic co-vectors. The existence of such SoV bases implies that the corresponding transfer
matrices have non degenerate spectrum and that they are diagonalizable with simple spectrum if
the twist matrices defining the quasi-periodic boundary conditions have that property. Moreover,
in these SoV bases the resolution of the transfer matrix eigenvalue problem leads to the resolution
of the full spectral problem, i.e. both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Indeed, to any eigenvalue
is associated the unique (up to a trivial overall normalization) eigenvector whose wave-function
in the SoV bases is factorized into products of the corresponding transfer matrix eigenvalue computed
on the spectrum of the separate variables. As an application, we characterize completely the transfer
matrix spectrum in our SoV framework for the fundamental $gl_{1|2}$ supersymmetric integrable
model associated to a special class of twist matrices. From these results we also prove the completeness
of the Bethe Ansatz for that case. The complete solution of the spectral problem for fundamental
inhomogeneous $gl_{\mathcal{M}|\mathcal{N}}$ supersymmetric integrable models and for the
inhomogeneous Hubbard model under the general twisted boundary conditions will be addressed in
a future publication.
