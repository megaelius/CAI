We construct a family of triangle-ladder diagrams which may be calculated by making use of Belokurov-Usyukina
loop reduction technique in d = 4 -2e dimensions. The main idea of the approach proposed in the present
paper consists in generalization of this loop reduction technique existing in d = 4 dimensions.
The recursive formula relating the result for L-loop triangle ladder diagram of this family and
the result for (L-1)-loop triangle ladder diagram of the same family is derived. Since the method
proposed in the present paper combines analytic and dimensional regularizations, at the end of
the calculation we have to remove the analytic regularization by taking the double uniform limit
in which the parameters of the analytic regularization are vanishing. In this limit on the left hand
side of the recursive relations we obtain in the position space the diagram in which the indices of
the rungs are 1 and all the other indices are 1-e. Fourier transformation of the diagrams of this type
gives the momentum space diagrams which have indices of the rungs equal to 1-e and all the other indices
1. Via conformal transformation of the dual space image of this momentum space representation we
relate such a family of the triangle ladder momentum diagrams to a family of the box ladder momentum
diagrams in which the indices of the rungs are equal to 1-e and all the other indices are 1. Since any
diagram from this family can be reduced to one-loop diagram, the proposed generalization of the
Belokurov-Usyukina loop reduction technique to non-integer number of dimensions allows us to
calculate this family of box-ladder diagrams in the momentum space explicitly in terms of Appell's
hypergeometric function F_4 without expanding in powers of parameter e in an arbitrary kinematic
region in the momentum space.
