In this work, we consider a specific shift--invariant quartic Horndeski model where the function
$G_4$ is chosen to be proportional to $\alpha \sqrt{(\partial \psi)^2/2}$, $\alpha$ denoting
the coupling of the theory and $\psi$ being some massless scalar field. We take $(D-2)$--many copies
of this model, and we assume a linear dependence of the scalar fields on the coordinates of the $(D-2)$--dimensional
Euclidean submanifold, $\psi^{I}=p\delta^{I}_i x^{i}$. These choices allow us to construct
planar black holes with a non--trivial axion profile which we explore in terms of their horizon structure
and their thermodynamic properties. Since the particular scalar field profile dissipates momentum
in the boundary theory, we are able to derive a sensible DC transport matrix describing the linear
thermoelectric response of the holographic dual to an external electric field and a thermal gradient.
We comment on the form of the conductivities and show that the heat conductivity--to--temperature
ratio cannot have a universal lower bound at all scales due to the new coupling. We also verify the
Kelvin formula motivated by the presence of an $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times\mathbb R^2$ horizon. Using
the constants $D_{\pm}$ describing coupled diffusion at finite chemical potential, we show that
these decouple in the incoherent limit of fast relaxation flowing to the usual expressions of charge/energy
diffusitivities respectively, with $\alpha$ playing no qualitative role at all in this process.
The bound of the refined $TD_{\pm}/v_B^2$ ratio is investigated, $v_B$ being the butterfly velocity.
The coupling enters the latter only through the horizon radius, and it does not affect the $\mathcal{O}(1)$
form of the ratio in the strong dissipation regime. Finally, the viscosity--to--entropy ratio
is computed by means of a (weaker) horizon formula, and the simple $(4\pi)^{-1}$--bound is found
to be violated.
