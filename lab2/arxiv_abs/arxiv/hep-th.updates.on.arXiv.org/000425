We derive constraints on the operator product expansion of two stress tensors in conformal field
theories (CFTs), both generic and holographic. We point out that in large $N$ CFTs with a large gap
to single-trace higher spin operators, the stress tensor sector is not only universal, but isolated:
that is, $\langle TT{\cal O}\rangle=0$, where ${\cal O}\neq T$ is a single-trace primary. We show
that this follows from a suppression of $\langle TT{\cal O}\rangle$ by powers of the higher spin
gap, $\Delta_{\rm gap}$, dual to the bulk mass scale of higher spin particles, and explain why $\langle
TT{\cal O}\rangle$ is a more sensitive probe of $\Delta_{\rm gap}$ than $a-c$ in 4d CFTs. This result
implies that, on the level of cubic couplings, the existence of a consistent truncation to Einstein
gravity is a direct consequence of the absence of higher spins. By proving similar behavior for other
couplings $\langle T{\cal O}_1{\cal O}_2\rangle$ where ${\cal O}_i$ have spin $s_i\leq 2$, we
are led to propose that $1/\Delta_{\rm gap}$ is the CFT "dual" of an AdS derivative in a classical
action. These results are derived by imposing unitarity on mixed systems of spinning four-point
functions in the Regge limit. Using the same method, but without imposing a large gap, we derive new
inequalities on these three-point couplings that are valid in any CFT. These are generalizations
of the Hofman-Maldacena conformal collider bounds. By combining the collider bound on $TT$ couplings
to spin-2 operators with analyticity properties of CFT data, we argue that all three tensor structures
of $\langle TTT\rangle$ in the free-field basis are nonzero in interacting CFTs.
