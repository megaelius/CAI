We analyze the Callan-Symanzik equations when scale invariance at a nontrivial infrared (IR) fixed
point $\alpha^{}_{\mathrm{IR}}$ is realized in the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode. As a result, Green's
functions at $\alpha^{}_{\mathrm{IR}}$ do not scale in the same way as for the conventional Wigner-Weyl
(WW) mode. This allows us to propose a new mechanism for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking
where the running coupling $\alpha$ "crawls" towards (but does not pass) $\alpha^{}_{\mathrm{IR}}$
in the exact IR limit. The NG mechanism at $\alpha^{}_{\mathrm{IR}}$ implies the existence of a
massless dilaton $\sigma$, which becomes massive for IR expansions in $\epsilon \equiv \alpha^{}_{\mathrm{IR}}
- \alpha$ and is identified with the Higgs boson. Unlike "dilatons" that are close to a WW-mode fixed
point or associated with a Coleman-Weinberg potential, our NG-mode dilaton is genuine and hence
naturally light. Its (mass)$^2$ is proportional to $\epsilon \beta'(4+\beta')F_\sigma^{-2}
\langle\hat{G}^2\rangle_{\text{vac}}$, where $\beta'$ is the (positive) slope of the beta function
at $\alpha^{}_{\mathrm{IR}}$, $F_\sigma$ is the dilaton decay constant and $\langle\hat{G}^2\rangle_{\text{vac}}$
is the technigluon condensate. Our effective field theory for this works because it respects Zumino's
consistency condition for dilaton Lagrangians. We find a closed form of the Higgs potential with
$\beta'$-dependent deviations from that of the Standard Model. Flavor-changing neutral currents
are suppressed if the crawling region $\alpha \lesssim \alpha^{}_{\mathrm{IR}}$ includes a sufficiently
large range of energies above the TeV scale. In Appendix A, we observe that, contrary to folklore,
condensates protect fields from decoupling in the IR limit.
