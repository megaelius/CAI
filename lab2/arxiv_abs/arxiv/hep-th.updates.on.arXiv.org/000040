A key problem in making precise perturbative QCD predictions is to set the proper renormalization
scale of the running coupling. The conventional scale-setting procedure assigns an arbitrary
range and an arbitrary systematic error to fixed-order pQCD predictions. In fact, this {\it ad hoc}
procedure gives results which depend on the choice of the renormalization scheme, and it is in conflict
with the standard scale-setting procedure used in QED. Predictions for physical results should
be independent of the choice of scheme or other theoretical conventions. We review current ideas
and points of view on how to deal with the renormalization scale ambiguity and show how to obtain renormalization
scheme- and scale- independent estimates. We begin by introducing the renormalization group (RG)
equation and an extended version, which expresses the invariance of physical observables under
both the renormalization scheme and scale-parameter transformations. The RG equation provides
a convenient way for estimating the scheme- and scale- dependence of a physical process. We then
discuss self-consistency requirements of the RG equations, such as reflexivity, symmetry, and
transitivity, which must be satisfied by a scale-setting method. Four typical scale setting methods
suggested in the literature, {\it i.e.,} the Fastest Apparent Convergence (FAC) criterion, the
Principle of Minimum Sensitivity (PMS), the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie method (BLM), and the Principle
of Maximum Conformality (PMC), are introduced. Basic properties and their applications are discussed.
We pay particular attention to the PMC, which satisfies all of the requirements of RG invariance......
