Black holes are the simplest objects in the universe. They correspond to extreme deformations of
spacetime geometry, and can exist even devoid of matter. In general relativity, (electro)vacuum
black holes are uniquely determined by their mass, charge and angular momentum. This feature follows
from a uniqueness theorem, which can be evaded if one considers higher dimensions or matter fields
coupled to gravity. Here we find that Einsteinian cubic gravity, a well-motivated modification
of Einstein gravity that includes third-order curvature corrections in accordance with low-energy
effective theory expectations, admits black hole solutions with charge greater than mass, when
minimally coupled to a Maxwell field. Moreover, we find that, in this regime, there can be two asymptotically
flat black holes with the same charge and mass, posing the first example of vacuum black hole nonuniqueness
in four dimensions that is free from pathologies. Examination of these black hole's thermodynamics
reveals that when two branches coexist only the larger black hole is thermodynamically stable,
while the smaller branch has negative specific heat. Einsteinian cubic gravity unveils two further
surprising features. The charged black holes do not possess an inner horizon, in contrast with the
usual Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, thus avoiding the need to resort to strong cosmic censorship
to uphold determinism. In addition to black holes, there exists a one-parameter family of naked
singularity spacetimes sharing the same mass and charge as the former, but not continuously connected
with them. These naked singularities exist in the under-extremal regime, being present even in
pure (uncharged) Einsteinian cubic gravity.
