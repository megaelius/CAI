[Abridged] The primordial scalar power spectrum is well constrained on large scales, primarily
by the observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Over the last
few years, it has been recognized that a sharp rise in power on small scales will lead to enhanced formation
of primordial black holes (PBHs) and also generate secondary gravitational waves (GWs) of higher
and, possibly, detectable amplitudes. It is well understood that scalar power spectra with COBE
normalized amplitude on the CMB scales and enhanced amplitudes on smaller scales can be generated
due to deviations from slow roll in single, canonical scalar field models of inflation. In fact,
an epoch of so-called ultra slow roll inflation can lead to the desired amplification. We find that
scenarios that lead to ultra slow roll can be broadly classified into two types, one wherein there
is a brief departure from inflation (a scenario referred to as punctuated inflation) and another
wherein such a departure does not arise. We consider a set of single field inflationary models involving
the canonical scalar field that lead to ultra slow roll and punctuated inflation and examine the
formation of PBHs as well as the generation of secondary GWs in these models. Apart from considering
specific models, we reconstruct potentials from certain functional choices of the first slow roll
parameter leading to ultra slow roll and punctuated inflation and investigate their observational
signatures. In addition to the secondary tensor power spectrum, we calculate the secondary tensor
bispectrum in the equilateral limit in these scenarios. Moreover, we calculate the inflationary
scalar bispectrum that arises in all the cases and discuss the imprints of the scalar non-Gaussianities
on the extent of PBHs formed and the amplitude of the secondary GWs.
