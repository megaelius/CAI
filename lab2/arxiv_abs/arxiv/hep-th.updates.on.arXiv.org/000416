We consider the entanglement dynamics between two-level atoms in a rotating black-hole background.
In our model the two-atom system is envisaged as an open system coupled with a massless scalar field
prepared in one of the physical vacuum states of interest. We employ the quantum master equation
in the Born-Markov approximation in order to describe the time evolution of the atomic subsystem.
We investigate two different states of motion for the atoms, namely static atoms and also stationary
atoms with zero angular momentum. The purpose of this work is to expound the impact on the creation
of entanglement coming from the combined action of the different physical processes underlying
the Hawking effect and the Unruh-Starobinskii effect. We demonstrate that, in the scenario of rotating
black holes, the degree of quantum entanglement is significantly modified due to the phenomenon
of superradiance in comparison with the analogous cases in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In addition,
we show that, in the perspective of a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), quantum entanglement
could be enhanced near the event horizon and at spatial infinity depending on the choice of the vacuum
for the quantum field. On the other hand, the presence of superradiant modes could be a source for
violation of complete positivity. This is verified when the quantum field is prepared in the Frolov-Thorne
vacuum state. In this exceptional situation, we interpret that the lost of complete positivity
is due to the Unruh-Starobinskii effect, which means that any arbitrary physically admissible
initial state of the two atoms would not be capable to hold, with time evolution, its interpretation
as a physical state inasmuch as negative probabilities are generated by the dynamical map.
