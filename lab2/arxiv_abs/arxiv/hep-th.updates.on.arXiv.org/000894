We present here a theory of fractional electro-magnetism which is capable of describing phenomenon
as disparate as the non-locality of the Pippard kernel in superconductivity and anomalous dimensions
for conserved currents in holographic dilatonic models. The starting point for our analysis is
the observation that the standard current conservation equations remain unchanged if any differential
operator that commutes with the total exterior derivative multiplies the current. Such an operator,
effectively changing the dimension of the current, increases the allowable gauge transformations
in electromagnetism and is at the heart of N\"other's second theorem. Here we develop a consistent
theory of electromagnetism that exploits this hidden redundancy in which the standard gauge symmetry
in electromagnetism is modified by the rotationally invariant operator, the fractional Laplacian.
We show that the resultant theories all allow for anomalous (non-traditional) scaling dimensions
of the gauge field and the associated current. Using well known extension theorems and the membrane
paradigm, we show that either the boundary (UV) or horizon (IR) theory of holographic dilatonic
models are both described by such fractional electromagnetism. We also show that the non-local
Pippard kernel introduced to solve the problem of the Meissner effect in elemental superconductors
can also be formulated as a special case of fractional electromagnetism. We show that the standard
charge quantization rules fail when the gauge field acquires an anomalous dimension. The breakdown
of charge quantization is discussed extensively in terms of the experimentally measurable modified
Aharonov-Bohm effect in the strange metal phase of the cuprate superconductors.
