Adinkras are graphs that encode a supersymmetric representation's transformation laws that have
been reduced to one dimension, that of time. A goal of the supersymmetry ``genomics'' project is
to classify all 4D, $\mathcal{N}=1$ off-shell supermultiplets in terms of their adinkras. In~previous
works, the genomics project uncovered two fundamental isomer adinkras, the cis- and trans-adinkras,
into which all multiplets investigated to date can be decomposed. The number of cis- and trans-adinkras
describing a given multiplet define the isomer-equivalence class to which the multiplet belongs.
A further refining classification is that of a supersymmetric multiplet's holoraumy: the commutator
of the supercharges acting on the representation. The one-dimensionally reduced, matrix representation
of a multiplet's holoraumy defines the multiplet's holoraumy-equivalence class. Together, a
multiplet's isomer-equivalence and holoraumy-equivalence classes are two of the main characteristics
used to distinguish the adinkras associated with different supersymmetry multiplets in higher
dimensions. This paper focuses on two matter gravitino formulations, each with 20 bosonic and 20
fermionic off-shell degrees of freedom, analyzes them in terms of their isomer- and holoraumy-equivalence
classes, and compares with non-minimal supergravity which is also a 20x20 multiplet. This analysis
fills a missing piece in the supersymmetry genomics project, as now the isomer-equivalence and
holoraumy-equivalence for representations up to spin two in component fields have been analyzed
for 4D, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. To handle the calculations of this research effort, we
have used the Mathematica software package called Adinkra.m. This package is open-source and available
for download at a GitHub Repository. Data files associated with this paper are also published open-source
at a Data Repository also on GitHub.
