We propose an unconventional formulation of lattice field theories which is quite general, although
originally motivated by the quest of exact lattice supersymmetry. Two long standing problems have
a solution in this context: 1) Each degree of freedom on the lattice corresponds to $2^d$ degrees
of freedom in the continuum, but all these doublers have (in the case of fermions) the same chirality
and can be either identified, thus removing the degeneracy, or, in some theories with extended supersymmetry,
identified with different members of the same supermultiplet. 2) The derivative operator, defined
on the lattice as a suitable periodic function of the lattice momentum, is an addittive and conserved
quantity, thus assuring that the Leibnitz rule is satisfied. This implies that the product of two
fields on the lattice is replaced by a non-local "star product" which is however in general non-associative.
Associativity of the "star product" poses strong restrictions on the form of the lattice derivative
operator (which becomes the inverse gudermannian function of the lattice momentum) and has the
consequence that the degrees of freedom of the lattice theory and of the continuum theory are in one-to-one
correspondence, so that the two theories are eventually equivalent. Regularization of the ultraviolet
divergences on the lattice is not associated to the lattice spacing, which does not act as a regulator,
but may be obtained by a one parameter deformation of the lattice derivative, thus preserving the
lattice structure even in the limit of infinite momentum cutoff. However this regularization breaks
gauge invariance and a gauge invariant regularization within the lattice formulation is still
lacking.
