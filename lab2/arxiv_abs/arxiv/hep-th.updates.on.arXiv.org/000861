We present a new, computationally efficient, energy-integrated approximation for neutrino effects
in hot and dense astrophysical environments such as supernova cores and compact binary mergers
and their remnants. Our new method, termed ILEAS for Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption
Scheme, improves the lepton-number and energy losses of traditional leakage descriptions by a
novel prescription of the diffusion time-scale based on a detailed energy integral of the flux-limited
diffusion equation. The leakage module is supplemented by a neutrino-equilibration treatment
that ensures the proper evolution of the total lepton number and medium plus neutrino energies as
well as neutrino-pressure effects in the neutrino-trapping domain. Moreover, we employ a simple
and straightforwardly applicable ray-tracing algorithm for including re-absorption of escaping
neutrinos especially in the decoupling layer and during the transition to semi-transparent conditions.
ILEAS is implemented on a three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian grid with a minimum of free and potentially
case-dependent parameters and exploits the basic physics constraints that should be fulfilled
in the neutrino-opaque and free-streaming limits. We discuss a suite of tests for stationary and
time-dependent proto-neutron star models and post-merger black-hole-torus configurations,
for which 3D ILEAS results are demonstrated to agree with energy-dependent 1D and 2D two-moment
(M1) neutrino transport on the level of 10--15 percent in basic neutrino properties. This also holds
for the radial profiles of the neutrino luminosities and of the electron fraction. Even neutrino
absorption maps around torus-like neutrino sources are qualitatively similar without any fine-tuning,
confirming that ILEAS can satisfactorily reproduce local losses and re-absorption of neutrinos
as found in sophisticated transport calculations.
