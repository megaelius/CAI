The subject of this thesis is the construction and the study of four-dimensional effective theories
with spontaneously broken and non-linearly realised global and local supersymmetry. In the first
part, the global supersymmetric case is analysed. The discussion starts from the supersymmetry
breaking sector, describing the goldstino and its interactions, in the case of minimal supersymmetry
and it is then generalised to a generic number of spontaneously broken supersymmetry generators.
A systematic procedure is given in order to construct effective theories with non-linearly realised
supersymmetry and with any desired spectrum content. In the second part of the thesis, non-linear
realisations are analysed in the case of local supersymmetry, namely supergravity. The coupling
of the goldstino sector to gravity is presented first and the superhiggs mechanism on a generic background
is discussed. Matter couplings are then constructed in some simple examples. A new class of models
is introduced in which supersymmetry is spontaneously broken and non-linearly realised already
on the gravity sector. As a consequence, it is possible to construct actions in which the cosmological
constant is bounded to be positive, which can be motivated for studying inflation. Two applications
of non-linear realisations in local supersymmetry are discussed in detail. In the first one it is
shown how to implement K\"ahler invariance in a way that mimics the global supersymmetric case.
In particular, the K\"ahler--Hodge restriction on the scalar manifold, which is typical of supergravity,
is avoided. In the second application the role of non-linear realisations in the construction of
de Sitter vacua is discussed. Attention is devoted to the relationship with known de Sitter uplift
constructions and with a new, recently proposed D-term in supergravity.
