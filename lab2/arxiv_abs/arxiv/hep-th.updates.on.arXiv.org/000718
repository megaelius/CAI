We analyze the electromagnetic-gravity interaction in a pure Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz framework.
To do so we formulate the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity in $4+1$ dimensions and perform a Kaluza-Klein
reduction to $3+1$ dimensions. We use this reduction as a mathematical procedure to obtain the $3+1$
coupled theory, which at the end is considered as a fundamental, self-consistent, theory. The critical
value of the dimensionless coupling constant in the kinetic term of the action is $\lambda=1/4$.
It is the kinetic conformal point for the non-relativistic electromagnetic-gravity interaction.
In distinction, the corresponding kinetic conformal value for pure Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity
in $3+1$ dimensions is $\lambda=1/3$. We analyze the geometrical structure of the critical and
noncritical cases, they correspond to different theories. The physical degrees of freedom propagated
by the noncritical theory are the transverse traceless graviton, the transverse gauge vector and
two scalar fields. In the critical theory one of the scalars is absent, only the dilaton scalar field
is present. The gravity and vector excitations propagate with the same speed, which at low energy
can be taken to be the speed of light. The field equations for the gauge vector in the non-relativistic
theory have exactly the same form as the relativistic electromagnetic field equations arising
from the Kaluza-Klein reduction of General Relativity, and are equal to them for a particular value
of one of the coupling constants. The potential in the Hamiltonian is a polynomial of finite degree
in the gauge vector and its covariant derivatives.
