Gauge theories possess non-local features that, in the presence of boundaries, inevitably lead
to subtleties. In this article, we continue our study of a unified solution based on a geometric tool
operating on field-space: a connection form. We specialize to the $D+1$ formulation of Yang-Mills
theories on configuration space, and we precisely characterize the gluing of the Yang-Mills field
across regions. In the $D+1$ formalism, the connection-form splits the electric degrees of freedom
into their pure-radiative and Coulombic components, rendering the latter as conjugate to the pure-gauge
part of the gauge potential. Regarding gluing, we obtain a characterization for topologically
simple regions through closed formulas. These formulas exploit the properties of a generalized
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined at the gluing surface; through them, we find only the radiative
components and the local charges are relevant for gluing. Finally, we study the gluing into topologically
non-trivial regions in 1+1 dimensions. We find that in this case, the regional radiative modes do
not fully determine the global radiative mode (Aharonov-Bohm phases). For the global mode takes
a new contribution from the kernel of the gluing formula, a kernel which is associated to non-trivial
cohomological cycles. In no circumstances do we find a need for postulating new local degrees of
freedom at boundaries. $\text{The partial results of these notes have been completed and substantially
clarified in a more recent, comprehensive article from October 2019. (titled: "The quasilocal
degrees of freedom of Yang-Mills theory").}$
