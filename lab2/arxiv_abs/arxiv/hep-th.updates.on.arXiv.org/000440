We study the propagation of exact gravitational waves in the ghost-free bimetric theory. Our focus
is on type N spacetimes compatible with the cosmological constants provided by the bigravity interaction
potential, and particularly in the single class known by allowing at least a Killing symmetry: the
AdS waves. They have the advantage of being represented by a generalized Kerr-Schild transformation
from AdS spacetime. This means a notorious simplification in bigravity by allowing to straightforwardly
compute any power of its interaction square root matrix, opening the door to explore physically
meaningful exact configurations. For these exact gravitational waves the complex dynamical structure
of bigravity decomposes into elementary exact massless or massive excitations propagating on
AdS. We use a complexified formulation of the Euler-Darboux equations to provide for the first time
the general solutions to the massive version of the Siklos equation which rules the resulting AdS-waves
dynamics, using an integral representation originally due to Poisson. Inspired in this progress
we tackle the subtle problem on how matter couples to bigravity and concretely if this occurs through
a composite metric, which is hard to handle in a general setting. Surprisingly, the Kerr-Schild
ansatz brings again a huge simplification in how the related energy-momentum tensors are calculated.
This allows us to explicitly characterize AdS waves supported in one case by a massless free scalar
field and by a wavefront-homogeneous Maxwell field in another. Considering the most general allowed
Maxwell source instead is a highly nontrivial task, that we accomplish by exploiting again the complexified
Euler-Darboux description and taking advantage of the classical Riemann method. In fact, this
allow us to find at the end the most general configurations for any matter source.
