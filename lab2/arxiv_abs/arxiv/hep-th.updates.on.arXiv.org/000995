A recently constructed limit of K3 has a long neck consisting of segments, each of which is a nilfold
fibred over a line, that are joined together with Kaluza-Klein monopoles. The neck is capped at either
end by a Tian-Yau space, which is non-compact, hyperkahler and asymptotic to a nilfold fibred over
a line. We show that the type IIA string on this degeneration of K3 is dual to the type I$'$ string, with
the Kaluza-Klein monopoles dual to the D8-branes and the Tian-Yau spaces providing a geometric
dual to the O8 orientifold planes. At strong coupling, each O8-plane can emit a D8-brane to give an
O8$^*$ plane, so that there can be up to 18 D8-branes in the type I$'$ string. In the IIA dual, this phenomenon
occurs at weak coupling and there can be up to 18 Kaluza-Klein monopoles in the dual geometry. We consider
further duals in which the Kaluza-Klein monopoles are dualised to NS5-branes or exotic branes.
A 3-torus with $H$-flux can be realised in string theory as an NS5-brane wrapped on $T^3$, with the
3-torus fibred over a line. T-dualising gives a 4-dimensional hyperkahler manifold which is a nilfold
fibred over a line, which can be viewed as a Kaluza-Klein monopole wrapped on $T^2$. Further T-dualities
then give non-geometric spaces fibred over a line and can be regarded as wrapped exotic branes. These
are all domain wall configurations, dual to the D8-brane. Type I$'$ string theory is the natural
home for D8-branes, and we dualise this to find string theory homes for each of these branes. The Kaluza-Klein
monopoles arise in the IIA string on the degenerate K3. T-duals of this give exotic branes on non-geometric
spaces.
