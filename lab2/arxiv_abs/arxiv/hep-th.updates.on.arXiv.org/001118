Weyl conformal geometry may play a role in early cosmology where effective theory at short distances
becomes conformal. Weyl conformal geometry also has a built-in geometric Stueckelberg mechanism:
it is broken spontaneously to Riemannian geometry after a Weyl gauge transformation (of "gauge
fixing") while Stueckelberg mechanism re-arranges the degrees of freedom, conserving their number
($n_{df}$). The Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$) of local scale transformations acquires a mass
after absorbing a compensator (dilaton), decouples, and Weyl connection becomes Riemannian.
Mass generation has thus a dynamic origin, as a transition from Weyl to Riemannian geometry. We show
that a "gauge fixing" symmetry transformation of the original Weyl quadratic gravity action in
its Weyl geometry formulation immediately gives the Einstein-Proca action for the Weyl gauge field
and a positive cosmological constant, plus matter action (if present). As a result, the Planck scale
is an {\it emergent} scale, where Weyl gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and Einstein action
is the broken phase of Weyl action. This is in contrast to local scale invariant models (no gauging)
where a negative kinetic term (ghost dilaton) remains present and $n_{df}$ is not conserved when
this symmetry is broken. The mass of $\omega_\mu$, setting the non-metricity scale, can be much
smaller than $M_\text{Planck}$, for ultraweak values of the coupling ($q$). If matter is present,
a positive contribution to the Planck scale from a scalar field ($\phi_1$) vev induces a negative
(mass)$^2$ term for $\phi_1$ and spontaneous breaking of the symmetry under which it is charged.
These results are immediate when using a Weyl geometry formulation of an action instead of its Riemannian
picture. Briefly, Weyl gauge symmetry is physically relevant and its role in high scale physics
should be reconsidered.
