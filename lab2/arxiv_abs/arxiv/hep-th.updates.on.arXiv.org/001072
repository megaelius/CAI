The search for extra dimensions is a challenging endeavor to probe physics beyond the Standard Model.
The joint detection of gravitational waves (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals from the merging
of a binary system of compact objects like neutron stars (NS), can help constrain the geometry of
extra dimensions beyond our 3+1 spacetime ones. A theoretically well-motivated possibility is
that our observable Universe is a 3+1-dimensional hypersurface, or brane, embedded in a higher
4+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$) spacetime, in which gravity is the only force which propagates
through the infinite bulk space, while other forces are confined to the brane. In these types of brane-world
models, GW and EM signals between two points on the brane would, in general, travel different paths.
This would result in a time-lag between the detection of GW and EM signals emitted simultaneously
from the same source. We consider the recent near-simultaneous detection of the GW event GW170817
from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, and its EM counterpart, the short gamma-ray burst GRB170817A
detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the INTEGRAL Anti-Coincidence Shield spectrometer.
Assuming the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario and performing a likelihood
analysis which takes into account astrophysical uncertainties associated to the measured time-lag,
we set an upper limit of $\ell \lesssim 0.535\,$Mpc at $68\%$ confidence level on the AdS$_5$ radius
of curvature $\ell$. Although the bound is not competitive with current Solar System constraints,
it is the first time that data from a multi-messenger GW-EM measurement is used to constrain extra-dimensional
models. Thus, our work provides a proof-of-principle for the possibility of using multi-messenger
astronomy for probing the geometry of our space-time.
