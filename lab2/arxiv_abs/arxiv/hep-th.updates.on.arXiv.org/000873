There exists a clear physical motivation for theoretical studies of the vacuum instability related
to the production of electron-positron pairs from a vacuum due to strong external electric fields.
Various nonperturbative (with respect to the external fields) calculation methods were developed.
Some of these methods are based on possible exact solutions of the Dirac equation. Unfortunately,
there are only few cases when such solutions are known. Recently, an approximate but still nonperturbative
approach to treat the vacuum instability caused by slowly varying $t$-electric potential steps
(time dependent external fields that vanish as $|t|\rightarrow\infty$), which does not depend
on the existence of the corresponding exact solutions, was formulated in Ref. [Phys. Rev. D 95, 076013
(2017)]. Here we present an approximate calculation method to treat nonperturbatively the vacuum
instability in arbitrary weakly inhomogeneous $x$-electric potential steps (time-independent
electric fields of a constant direction that are concentrated in restricted space areas, which
means that the fields vanish as $|x|\rightarrow\infty$) in the absence of the corresponding exact
solutions. Defining the weakly inhomogeneous regime in general terms, we demonstrate an universal
character of the vacuum instability. This universality is associated with a large density of states
excited from the vacuum by the electric field. Such a density appears in our approach as a large parameter.
We derive universal representations for the total number and current density of created particles.
Relations of these representations with a locally constant field approximation for Schwinger's
effective action are found.
