In this paper, the linearized field equations related to the quadratic curvature gravity theory
have been obtained in the four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space-time. The massless spin-2 field
equations have been written in terms of the Casimir operators of dS group making use of the ambient
space notations. By imposing some simple constraints, arisen from group theoretical interpretation
of the field equations, a new four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet (GB)-like action has been introduced
with the related field equations transforming according to the unitary irreducible representations
(UIR's) of dS group. Since, the field equations transform according to the UIR's of dS group, the
GB-like action, we just obtained, is expected to be a successful model of modified gravity. For more
clarifying, the gauge invariant field equations have been solved in terms of a gauge-fixing parameter
${\cal{C}}$. It has been shown that the solution can be written as the multiplication of a symmetric
rank-2 polarization tensor and a massless minimally coupled scalar field on dS space. The Gupta-Bleuler
quantization method has been utilized and the covariant two-point function has been calculated
in terms of the massless minimally coupled scalar two-point function, using the ambient space notations.
It has been written in terms of dS intrinsic coordinates from the ambient space counterpart. The
two-point functions are dS invariant and free of any theoretical problems. It means that the proposed
model is a successful model of modified gravity and it can produce significant results in the contexts
of classical theory of gravity and quantum gravity toy models.
