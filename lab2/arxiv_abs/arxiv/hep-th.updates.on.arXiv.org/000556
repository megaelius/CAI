In this paper we will study Lorentz-invariant, infinite derivative quantum field theories, where
infinite derivatives give rise to non-local interactions, which manifests at the energy scale
$M_s$, beyond the Standard Model. We will study a specific class, where there are no it new dynamical
degrees of freedom other than the original ones of the corresponding local theory. We will show in
a systematic way that the Green functions are modified by a non-local extra term that is responsible
for acausal effects, which are confined in the region of non-locality, i.e. $M_s^{-1}.$ Indeed,
the standard time-ordered structure of the causal Feynman propagator is not preserved; moreover,
the retarded Green function turns out to be non-vanishing for space-like separations. Physically,
formulating such theories in the non-local region with Minkowski signature is not sensible, but
they have a beautiful Euclidean interpretation. We will show how such non-local construction ameliorates
ultraviolet/short-distance singularities suffered typically in the local quantum field theory,
in particular the Euclidean $2$-point correlation function is singularity-free on the lightcone
surface. We will show that non-locality and acausality are inherently off-shell in nature, and
as such classical physics do not make sense inside the non-local region, or for momenta higher than
$M_s$, but only quantum amplitudes are physically meaningful, so that all the perturbative quantum
corrections have to be consistently taken into account. Moreover, the analytic continuation of
the Wightman function, i.e. the Schwinger function, does not coincide with the Euclidean propagator
mainly due to the fact that it solves the homogeneous field equations, and is not it at all affected
by the non-locality. As a consequence, the local commutativity and the reflection positivity conditions
still hold.
