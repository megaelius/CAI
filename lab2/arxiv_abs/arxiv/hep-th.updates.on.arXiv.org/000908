In previous works, we have proposed a new formulation of Yang-Mills theory on the lattice so that
the so-called restricted field obtained from the gauge-covariant decomposition plays the dominant
role in quark confinement. This framework improves the Abelian projection in the gauge-independent
manner. For quarks in the fundamental representation, we have demonstrated some numerical evidences
for the restricted field dominance in the string tension, which means that the string tension extracted
from the restricted part of the Wilson loop reproduces the string tension extracted from the original
Wilson loop. However, it is known that the restricted field dominance is not observed for the Wilson
loop in higher representations if the restricted part of the Wilson loop is extracted by adopting
the Abelian projection or the field decomposition naively in the same way as in the fundamental representation.
In this paper, therefore, we focus on confinement of quarks in higher representations. By virtue
of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop operator, we propose suitable gauge-invariant
operators constructed from the restricted field to reproduce the correct behavior of the original
Wilson loop averages for higher representations. Moreover, we perform lattice simulations to
measure the static potential for quarks in higher representations using the proposed operators.
We find that the proposed operators well reproduce the behavior of the original Wilson loop average,
namely, the linear part of the static potential with the correct value of the string tension, which
overcomes the problem that occurs in naively applying Abelian-projection to the Wilson loop operator
for higher representations.
