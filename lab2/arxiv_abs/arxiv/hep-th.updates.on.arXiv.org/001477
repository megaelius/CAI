Construction of superintegrable systems based on Lie algebras have been introduced over the years.
However, these approaches depend on explicit realisations, for instance as a differential operators,
of the underlying Lie algebra. This is also the case for the construction of their related symmetry
algebra which take usually the form of a finitely generated quadratic algebra. These algebras often
display structure constants which depend on the central elements and in particular on the Hamiltonian.
In this paper, we develop a new approach reexamining the case of the generic superintegrable systems
on the 2-sphere for which a symmetry algebra is known to be the Racah algebra $R(3)$. Such a model is
related to the 59 $2D$ superintegrable systems on conformally flat spaces and their 12 equivalence
classes. We demonstrate that using further polynomials of degree 2,3 and 4 in the enveloping algebra
of $su(3)$ one can generate an algebra based only on abstract commutation relations of $su(3)$ Lie
algebra without explicit constraints on the representations or realisations. This construction
relies on the maximal Abelian subalgebra, also called MASA, which are the Cartan generators and
their commutant. We obtain a new 6-dimensional cubic algebra where the structure constant are integer
numbers which reduce from a quartic algebra for which the structure constant depend on the Cartan
generator and the Casimir invariant. We also present other form of the symmetry algebra using the
quadratic and cubic Casimir invariants of $su(3)$. It reduces as the known quadratic Racah algebra
$R(3)$ only when using an explicit realization. This algebraic structure describe the symmetry
of the generic superintegrable systems on the 2 sphere. We also present a contraction to another
6-dimensional cubic algebra which would corresponding to the symmetry algebra of a Smorodinsky-Winternitz
model.
