We rediscuss the main Cosmological Problems as illusions induced by our ignorance of the complete
information holographically stored in {\it vacuo}. The Cosmological vacuum state is full of a large
number of dynamical quantum hairs, dubbed {\it hairons}, which dominate the Cosmological Entropy.
We elaborate on the Cosmological Constant (CC) problem, in both the dynamical and time-constant
possibilities. We show that all dangerous quantum mixings between the CC and the Planck energy scales
are exponentially suppressed as an entropic collective effect of the hairon environment. As a consequence,
the dark energy scale is UV insensitive to any quantum gravity corrections. On the other hand, the
inflation scale is similarly stabilized from any radiative effects. In the case of the Dark energy,
we show the presence of a holographic entropic attractor, favoring a time variation of $\Lambda\rightarrow
0$ in future rather than a static CC case; i.e. $w>-1$ Dynamical DE is favored over a CC or a $w<-1$ phantom
cosmology. In both the inflation and dark energy sectors, we elaborate on the Trans-Planckian problem,
in relation with the recently proposed Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC). We show that
the probability for any sub-planckian length modes to survive after inflation is completely negligible
as a holographic wash-out mechanism. This avoids the TCC strong bounds on the Inflaton and DE potentials.
We will explain how all these results are understood as the effect of the Cosmological effective
decoherence, efficiently induced by the hairon ensamble into the Inflaton and DE sectors, in a holographic
scrambling time transient.
