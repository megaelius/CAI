The study of the geometry of Calabi-Yau fourfolds is relevant for compactifications of string theory,
M-theory, and F-theory to various dimensions. In the first part of this thesis, we study the action
of mirror symmetry on two-dimensional $\cN=(2,2)$ effective theories obtained by compactifying
Type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Our focus is on fourfold geometries with non-trivial
three-form cohomology. The couplings of the massless zero-modes arising from an expansion of the
three-form gauge-potential into these forms depend both on the complex structure deformations
and the K\"ahler structure deformations of the Calabi-Yau fourfold. We argue that two holomorphic
functions, called three-form periods, one for each kind of deformation, capture this information.
These are exchanged under mirror symmetry, which allows us to derive them at the large complex structure
and large volume point. We discuss the application of the resulting explicit expression to F-theory
compactifications and their weak string coupling limit. The second part of this work introduces
the mathematical machinery to derive the complete moduli dependence of the periods of non-trivial
three-forms for fourfolds realized as hypersurfaces in toric ambient spaces. It sets the stage
to determine Picard-Fuchs-type differential equations and integral expressions for these forms.
The key tool is the observation that non-trivial three-forms on fourfold hypersurfaces in toric
ambient spaces always stem from divisors that are build out of trees of toric surfaces fibered over
Riemann surfaces. The three-form periods are then non-trivially related to the one-form periods
of these Riemann surfaces. We conclude with two explicit example fourfolds for F-theory compactifications
%in which the three-form periods determine axion decay constants.
