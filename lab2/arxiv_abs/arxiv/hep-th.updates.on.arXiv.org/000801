Models of static wormholes are investigated in the framework of $f(\textit{R}, \textit{T})$ gravity
($\textit{R}$ being the curvature scalar, and $\textit{T}$ the trace of the energy momentum tensor).
An attempt to link the energy density of the matter component to the Ricci scalar is made, which for
the Morris and Thorne wormhole metric, with constant redshift function, yields $R(r) = 2b^{\prime}(r)/r^{2}$.
Exact wormhole solutions are obtained for three particular cases: $\rho(r) = \alpha R(r) + \beta
R^{\prime}(r)$, $\rho(r) = \alpha R^{2}(r) + \beta R^{\prime}(r)$, and $\rho(r) = \alpha R(r)
+ \beta R^{2}(r)$, when $f(\textit{R}, \textit{T}) = R + 2 \lambda T$. For the two first ones, traversable
wormhole models are obtained. When the matter energy density is of the 3rd type, only solutions with
constant shape may correspond to traversable wormholes. Exact wormhole solutions with same properties
can be constructed for $\rho = \alpha R(r) + \beta R^{-2}(r)$, $\rho = \alpha R(r) + \beta r R^{2}(r)$,
$\rho = \alpha R(r) + \beta r^{-1} R^{2}(r)$, $\rho = \alpha R(r) + \beta r ^{2} R^{2}(r)$, $\rho =
\alpha R(r) + \beta r^{3} R^{2}(r)$ and $\rho = \alpha r^m R(r) \log (\beta R(r))$, as well. On the
other hand, for $f(\textit{R}, \textit{T}) = R + \gamma R^{2} + 2 \lambda T$ gravity, two wormhole
models are constructed, assuming that the energy density of the wormhole matter is $\rho(r) = \alpha
R(r) + \beta R^{2}(r)$ and $\rho(r) = \alpha R(r) + \beta r^{3} R^{2}(r)$, respectively. In this
case, the functional form of the shape function is taken to be $b(r) = \sqrt{\hat{r}_{0} r}$ and possible
existence of appropriate static traversable wormhole configurations is proven. These results
can be viewed as an initial step towards using specific properties of the new exact wormhole solutions,
in order to propose new functional forms for describing the matter content of the wormhole.
