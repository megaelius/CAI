The cosmological energy density $\rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$ at the Planck scale $M_{\rm pl}$ drives
inflation and simultaneously reduces its value to create the pair-energy density $\rho_{_{_M}}$
via the continuous pair productions of massive fermions and antifermions. The decreasing $\rho_{_{_\Lambda}}$
and increasing $\rho_{_{_M}}$, in turn, slows down the inflation to its end when the pair production
rate $\Gamma_M$ is larger than the Hubble rate $H$ of inflation. A large number of massive pairs is
produced and reheating epoch starts. In addition to Einstein equation and energy-conservation
law, we introduce the Boltzmann-type rate equation describing the number of pairs produced from
(annihilating to) the spacetime, and reheating equation describing massive unstable pairs decay
to relativistic particles and thermodynamic laws. This forms a close set of four independent differential
equations uniquely determining $H$, $\rho_{_\Lambda}$, $\rho_{_M}$ and radiation-energy density
$\rho_{_R}$, given the initial conditions at inflation end. Numerical solutions demonstrate
three episodes of preheating, massive pairs dominate and genuine reheating. Results show that
$\rho_{_\Lambda}$ can efficiently converts to $\rho_{_M}$ by producing massive pairs, whose
decay accounts for reheating $\rho_{_R}$, temperature and entropy of the Big-Bang Universe. The
stable massive pairs instead account for cold dark matter. Using CMB and baryon number-to-entropy
ratio measurements, we constrain effective mass of pairs, Yukawa coupling and degeneracies of
relativistic particles. As a result, the obtained inflation $e$-folding number, reheating scale,
temperature and entropy are in terms of the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the theoretically predicated
range $0.042\lesssim r \lesssim 0.048$, consistently with current observations.
