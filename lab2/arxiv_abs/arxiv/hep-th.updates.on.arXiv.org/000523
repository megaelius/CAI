In this lecture I will explain the established pictures of the QCD vacuum and, in particular, the
underlying confinement mechanism. These are: the magnetic monopole condensation (dual Mei\ss
ner effect), the center vortex picture and the Gribov--Zwanziger picture. I will start by giving
a survey of the common order and disorder parameters of confinement: the temporal and spatial Wilson
loop, the Polyakov loop and the 't Hooft loop. Next the dual Mei\ss ner effect, which assumes a condensate
of magnetic monopoles, will be explained as a picture of confinement. I will also show how magnetic
monopoles arises in QCD after the so-called Abelian projection. The second lecture is devoted to
the center vortex picture of confinement. Center vortices will be defined both on the lattice and
in the continuum. Within the center vortex picture the emergence of the area law for the Wilson loop
as well as the deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature will be explained. Furthermore,
lattice evidence for the center vortex picture will be provided. Finally, I will discuss the topological
properties of center vortices and their relation to magnetic monopoles. I will provide evidence
from lattice calculations that center vortices are not only responsible for confinement but also
for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. In the last lecture I will present the Hamiltonian
approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge, which is then used to establish the Gribov--Zwanziger picture
of confinement. Furthermore, I will also relate this scenario to the dual Mei\ss ner effect and the
center vortex picture. Finally, I will study QCD at finite temperature within the Hamiltonian approach
in a novel way by compactifying one spatial dimension. The Polyakov loop and the dual and chiral quark
condensates will be evaluated as function of the temperature.
