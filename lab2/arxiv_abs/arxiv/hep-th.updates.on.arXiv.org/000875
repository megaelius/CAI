We study the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole in the presence of further inverse triad quantum
corrections, using loop quantum gravity techniques. Although this model has been studied using
loop quantization before, so far, inverse triad corrections have been neglected, mostly to simplify
the analysis. Due to the noncompact spatial topology of the model, it is customary to introduce a
fiducial cell, to make it possible to define the symplectic structure, but one should be careful
so that the physical implications become independent of such fiducial structures. However, this
seems to become a hard problem when further triad corrections are present. In this work, we introduce
a systematic way to incorporate the inverse triad corrections in the Hamiltonian of the system.
The form of the corrections in the present model is related to the way two certain parameters $\delta_b,
\delta_c$ enter the Thiemann's formula. These parameters, in turn, depend on the ratio of the minimum
area gap $\Delta$ to the classical Schwarzschild radius $r_0$, or to the height, $L_0$, of the fiduciary
cell. To deal with the dependence of physical results on $L_0$, we consider three possibilities
for the parameters: (i) $\delta_b= \frac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{r_0}$, $\delta_c= \frac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{L_0}$,
(ii) $\delta_b= \frac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{L_0}$, $\delta_c= \frac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{r_0}$, and
(iii) $\delta_b=\frac{L_0}{\sqrt{\Delta}}$ and $\delta_c= \frac{r_0}{\sqrt{\Delta}}$.
Our analysis shows that only (iii), which is different from the sector without inverse triads, leads
to physically acceptable results. Furthermore, we retain previous important results such as singularity
resolution and black-to-white hole bounce, but with a different value for the minimum radius at
bounce, and the mass of the white hole. Finally we discuss how our proposal might be generalized to
other models.
