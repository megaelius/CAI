We investigate the long-range statistical correlations, whereby discuss the nature of the undermining
interacting/ noninteracting domains and associated phase transitions under variations of the
quark mass and the mass scale that corresponds to renormalized pion masses and the dimensions of
an ensemble of slab sub-volumes of an arbitrary simulated lattice. The purpose of this paper is to
compute the system's stability and its phase structures when it's model parameters vary infinitesimally.
In particular, we focus on the stability properties and phases of an arbitrary (2+1) flavor QCD configuration
under fluctuations of its parameters. In order to investigate the nature of statistical and systematic
errors, and the presence of noises in the system, we explore fluctuation theory equivalences of
the slab sub-volume method of computing the topological susceptibility with its low energy ChPT
counterpart. Hereby, we find that the ChPT configurations always correspond to a non-interacting
statistical basis in the space of the quark mass and the mass scale that corresponds to renormalized
pion masses. The second system as an ensemble of finite slab sub-volumes of a simulated lattice turns
out to be generically interacting under fluctuations of the slab dimensions. However, it yields
an ill-defined degenerate system in the infinitesimal limit of slab parameters. It is worth mentioning
that implications of the intrinsic geometric analysis are well suited towards the modeling based
understanding of the gluonic topological charge density fluctuations, quark mass dependence
and long auto-correlation of the global topology. Finally, we discuss the stability properties
of sub-volume simulated lattice improvements towards the understanding of QCD vacua, the behavior
of UV divergences, finite-volume effects, statistical precision, simultaneous measurements,
and associated quantum channel measurements.
