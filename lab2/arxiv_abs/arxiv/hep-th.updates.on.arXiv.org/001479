We compute the closed-string cylinder amplitude between one Dp brane and the other Dp$\prime$ brane,
placed parallel at a separation, with each carrying a general constant worldvolume flux and with
$p - p' = 0, 2, 4, 6$ and $p \le 6$. For the $p = p'$, we show that the main part of the amplitude for $p = p'
< 5$ is a special case of that for $p = p' = 5$ or $6$ case. For all other $p - p' = 2, 4, 6$ cases, we show that
the amplitude is just a special case of the corresponding one for $p = p'$ case. Combining both, we
obtain the general formula for the amplitude, which is valid for each of the cases considered and
for arbitrary constant worldvolume fluxes. The corresponding general open string one-loop annulus
amplitude is also obtained by a Jacobi transformation of the general cylinder one. We give also the
general open string pair production rate. We study the properties of the amplitude such as the nature
of the interaction, the open string tachyonic instability, and the possible open string pair production
and its potential enhancement. In particular, in the presence of pure magnetic fluxes or magnetic-like
fluxes, we find that the nature of interaction is correlated with the existence of potential open
string tachyonic instability. When the interaction is attractive, there always exists an open
string tachyonic instability when the brane separation reaches the minimum determined by the so-called
tachyonic shift. When the interaction is repulsive, there is no such instability for any brane separation.
We also find that the enhancement of open string pair production, in the presence of pure electric
fluxes, can occur only for the $p - p' = 2$ case.
