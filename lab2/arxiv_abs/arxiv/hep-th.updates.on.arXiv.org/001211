Consider a zero-temperature Landau symmetry breaking transition in a $d+1$D quantum system that
completely breaks a finite symmetry $G$ (a 0-symmetry). The critical point at the transition has
the symmetry $G$. In this paper, we show that the critical point also has a $(d-1)$-symmetry described
by higher group when $G$ is Abelian or an algebraic $(d-1)$-symmetry beyond higher group when $G$
is non-Abelian. In fact, when restricted to the symmetric subspace, a $G$-symmetric system can
be regarded as having a non-invertible gravitational anomaly, i.e. can be viewed as the boundary
of $G$-gauge theory in one higher dimension. The conservation of gauge charge and gauge flux in the
bulk $G$-gauge theory leads to the above two symmetries. Due to their origin from non-invertible
gravitational anomaly, we believe that part (but not all) of the above two symmetries must be spontaneously
broken in any gapped phase, but there exists a gapless state (i.e. a gapless boundary of $G$-gauge
theory in one higher dimension) where both the symmetries are not spontaneously broken. Such a gapless
state corresponds to the usual critical point of Landau symmetry breaking transition. The above
results remain valid even if we expand the notion of symmetry to include higher symmetries described
by higher group and algebraic higher symmetries beyond higher group. Thus our result also applies
to critical points for transitions between topological phases of matter. In particular, we show
that there can be several critical points for transitions from 3+1D $Z_2$ gauge theory to trivial
phase. The critical point from Higgs condensation has a $Z_2$ 0-symmetry and a $Z_2$ 2-symmetry,
while the critical point from confinement transition has a $Z_2\times Z_2$ 1-symmetry.
