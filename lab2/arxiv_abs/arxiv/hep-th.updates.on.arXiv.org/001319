[Abridged] We realize the Agrawal-Obied-Vafa (AOV) swampland proposal of fading dark matter by
the model of Salam-Sezgin and its string realization of Cvetic-Gibbons-Pope. The model describes
a compactification of 6-dimensional supergravity with a monopole background on a 2-sphere. In
4 dimensions, there are 2 scalar fields, $X$ and $Y $, and the effective potential in the Einstein
frame is an exponential with respect to $Y$ times a quadratic polynomial in the field $e^{-X}$. When
making the volume of the 2-sphere large, namely for large values of $Y$, there appears a tower of states,
which according to the infinite distance swampland conjecture becomes exponentially massless.
If the standard model fields are confined on Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes the 6-dimensional gauge couplings
are independent of the string dilaton in the string frame, and upon compactification to 4 dimensions
the 4-dimensional gauge couplings depend on $X$ (rather than the dilaton $Y$) which is fixed at the
minimum of the potential. This avoids direct couplings of the dilaton to matter suppressing extra
forces competing with gravity. We show that this set up has the salient features of the AOV models,
and ergo can potentially ameliorate the tension between local distance ladder and cosmic microwave
background estimates of the Hubble constant $H_0$. Although the AOV proposal does not fully resolve
the tension in $H_0$ measurements, it provides a dynamical dark energy model of cosmology that satisfies
the de Sitter swampland conjecture. We comment on a viable solution to overcome the tension between
low- and high-redshift observations within the AOV background and discuss the implications for
the swampland program.
