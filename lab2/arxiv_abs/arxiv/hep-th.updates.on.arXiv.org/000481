It has been conjectured that in theories consistent with quantum gravity infinite distances in
field space coincide with an infinite tower of states becoming massless exponentially fast in the
proper field distance. The complex-structure moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds is a good testing
ground for this conjecture since it is known to encode quantum gravity physics. We study infinite
distances in this setting and present new evidence for the above conjecture. Points in moduli space
which are at infinite proper distance along any path are characterised by an infinite order monodromy
matrix. We utilise the nilpotent orbit theorem to show that for a large class of such points the monodromy
matrix generates an infinite orbit within the spectrum of BPS states. We identify an infinite tower
of states with this orbit. Further, the theorem gives the local metric on the moduli space which can
be used to show that the mass of the states decreases exponentially fast upon approaching the point.
We also propose a reason for why infinite distances are related to infinite towers of states. Specifically,
we present evidence that the infinite distance itself is an emergent quantum phenomenon induced
by integrating out at one-loop the states that become massless. Concretely, we show that the behaviour
of the field space metric upon approaching infinite distance can be recovered from integrating
out the BPS states. Similarly, at infinite distance the gauge couplings of closed-string Abelian
gauge symmetries vanish in a way which can be matched onto integrating out the infinite tower of charged
BPS states. This presents evidence towards the idea that also the gauge theory weak-coupling limit
can be thought of as emergent.
