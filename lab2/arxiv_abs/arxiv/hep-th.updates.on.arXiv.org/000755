The black-hole information puzzle has attracted much attention over the years from both physicists
and mathematicians. One of the most intriguing suggestions to resolve the information paradox
is due to Bekenstein, who has stressed the fact that the low-energy part of the semi-classical black-hole
emission spectrum is partly blocked by the curvature potential that surrounds the black hole. As
explicitly shown by Bekenstein, this fact implies that the grey-body emission spectrum of a (3+1)-dimensional
black hole is considerably less entropic than the corresponding radiation spectrum of a perfectly
thermal black-body emitter. Using standard ideas from quantum information theory, it was shown
by Bekenstein that, in principle, the filtered Hawking radiation emitted by a (3+1)-dimensional
Schwarzschild black hole may carry with it a substantial amount of information, the information
which was suspected to be lost. It is of physical interest to test the general validity of the "information
leak" scenario suggested by Bekenstein as a possible resolution to the Hawking information puzzle.
In the present paper we analyze the semi-classical entropy emission properties of higher-dimensional
black holes. In particular, we provide evidence that the characteristic Hawking quanta of $(D+1)$-dimensional
Schwarzschild black holes in the large $D\gg1$ regime are almost unaffected by the spacetime curvature
outside the black-hole horizon. This fact implies that, in the large-$D$ regime, the Hawking black-hole
radiation spectra are almost purely thermal, thus suggesting that the emitted quanta cannot carry
the amount of information which is required in order to resolve the information paradox. Our analysis
therefore suggests that the elegant information leak scenario suggested by Bekenstein cannot
provide a generic resolution to the intriguing Hawking information paradox.
