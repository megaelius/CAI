This thesis deals with applications of holographic dualities to the study of background field and
time dependence effects in strongly coupled field theories. The first chapters (2-5) aim to provide
a self-contained review of the Sakai-Sugimoto model (SSM) as a top-down approach to holographic
QCD, introducing first the necessary background on QCD, string theory and AdS/CFT. Chapter 7 reviews
finite temperature holography, to be used in the subsequent chapters. We use the non-Abelian ($N_f
= 2$) SSM to study a possible magnetically induced instability of the QCD vacuum towards a superconducting
phase, as previously discussed in phenomenological QCD models and there referred to as "rho meson
condensation". We find that this instability can indeed be holographically described by the SSM,
and obtain increasingly higher predictions for the necessary critical magnetic field in increasingly
complicated (i.e. less simplified) set-ups. The obtained results are presented in chapter 6 and
are based on arXiv:1105.2217 and arXiv:1309.5042 . In chapter 8 we discuss the splitting of chiral
transition temperatures per flavour in the finite temperature regime of the $N_f = 2$ SSM, indicating
an intermediate phase where chiral symmetry is only partially restored. This was previously presented
in arXiv:1303.5674 . In chapter 9, instead of a top-down approach, bottom-up models known as "AdS-Vaidya"
models are used in the context of condensed matter applications to study far-from-equilibrium
behaviour of strongly coupled electron systems. A notion of a time-dependent spectral function
is defined and calculated in Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS$_4$-Vaidya as a very first step towards
extracting in principle measurable quantities in time-resolved ARPES experiments [ arXiv:1407.5975
]. Focus is put on explaining the used numerical method (pseudospectral method).
