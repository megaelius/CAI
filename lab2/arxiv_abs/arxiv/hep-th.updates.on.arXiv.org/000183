In this Ph.D. thesis, the primary goal is to present a recent investigation of the finite density
thermodynamics of hot and dense quark-gluon plasma. As we are interested in a temperature regime,
in which naive perturbation theory is known to lose its predictive power, we clearly need to use a
refined approach. To this end, we adopt a resummed perturbation theory point of view and employ two
different frameworks. We first use hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory (HLTpt) at leading
order to obtain the pressure for nonvanishing quark chemical potentials, and next, inspired by
dimensional reduction, resum the known four-loop weak coupling expansion for the quantity. We
present and analyze our findings for various cumulants of conserved charges. This provides us with
information, through correlations and fluctuations, on the degrees of freedom effectively present
in the quark-gluon plasma right above the deconfinement transition. Moreover, we compare our results
with state-of-the-art lattice Monte Carlo simulations as well as with a recent three-loop mass
truncated HTLpt calculation. We obtain very good agreement between the two different perturbative
schemes, as well as between them and lattice data, down to surprisingly low temperatures right above
the phase transition. We also quantitatively test the convergence of an approximation, which is
used in higher order loop calculations in HTLpt. This method based on expansions in mass parameters,
is unavoidable beyond leading order, thus motivating our investigation. We find the ensuing convergence
to be very fast, validating its use in higher order computations.
