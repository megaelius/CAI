Charged dilatonic black hole (BH) has rather rich phase diagrams which may contain zeroth-order,
first-order as well as reentrant phase transitions (RPTs) depending on the value of the coupling
constant $\alpha$ between the electromagnetic field and the dilaton. We try to give a microscopic
explanation for these phase transitions by adopting Ruppeiner's approach. By studying the behaviors
of the Ruppeiner invariant $R$ along the co-existing lines, we find that the various phase transitions
may be well explained as a result of two completing mechanisms: the first one is the low-temperature
effect which tends to shrink the BH and the second one is the repulsive interaction between the BH
molecules which, on the contrary, tends to expand the BH. In the standard phase transition without
RPT, as temperature is lowered, the first kind of mechanism dominates over the second one, so that
large black hole (LBH) tends to shrink and thus transits to small black hole (SBH); While in the RPT,
after the LBH-SBH transition, as temperature is further decreased, the strength of the second mechanism
increases quickly and finally becomes strong enough to dominate over the first mechanism, so that
SBH tends to expand to release the high repulsion and thus transits back to LBH. Moreover, by comparing
the behavior of $R$ versus the temperature $T$ with fixed pressure to that of ordinary two-dimensional
thermodynamical systems but with fixed specific volume, it is interesting to see that SBH behaves
like a Fermionic gas system in cases with RPT, while it behaves oppositely to an anyon system in cases
without RPT. And in all cases, LBH behaves like a nearly ideal gas system.
