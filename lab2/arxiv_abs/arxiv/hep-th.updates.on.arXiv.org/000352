We analyze the partition function of three-dimensional quantum gravity on the twisted solid tours
and the ensuing dual field theory. The setting is that of a non-perturbative model of three dimensional
quantum gravity--the Ponzano-Regge model, that we briefly review in a self-contained manner--which
can be used to compute quasi-local amplitudes for its boundary states. In this second paper of the
series, we choose a particular class of boundary spin-network states which impose Gibbons-Hawking-York
boundary conditions to the partition function. The peculiarity of these states is to encode a two-dimensional
quantum geometry peaked around a classical quadrangulation of the finite toroidal boundary. Thanks
to the topological properties of three-dimensional gravity, the theory easily projects onto the
boundary while crucially still keeping track of the topological properties of the bulk. This produces,
at the non-perturbative level, a specific non-linear sigma-model on the boundary, akin to a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten
model, whose classical equations of motion can be used to reconstruct different bulk geometries:
the expected classical one is accompanied by other "quantum" solutions. The classical regime of
the sigma-model becomes reliable in the limit of large boundary spins, which coincides with the
semiclassical limit of the boundary geometry. In a 1-loop approximation around the solutions to
the classical equations of motion, we recover (with corrections due to the non-classical bulk geometries)
results obtained in the past via perturbative quantum General Relativity and through the study
of characters of the BMS3 group. The exposition is meant to be completely self-contained.
