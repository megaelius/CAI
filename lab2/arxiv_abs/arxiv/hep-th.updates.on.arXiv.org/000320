Observations of the CMB today allow us to answer detailed questions about the properties of our Universe,
targeting both standard and non-standard physics. In this paper, we study the effects of varying
fundamental constants (i.e., the fine-structure constant, $\alpha_{\rm EM}$, and electron rest
mass, $m_{\rm e}$) around last scattering using the recombination codes CosmoRec and Recfast++.
We approach the problem in a pedagogical manner, illustrating the importance of various effects
on the free electron fraction, Thomson visibility function and CMB power spectra, highlighting
various degeneracies. We demonstrate that the simpler Recfast++ treatment (based on a three-level
atom approach) can be used to accurately represent the full computation of CosmoRec. We also include
explicit time-dependent variations using a phenomenological power-law description. We reproduce
previous Planck 2013 results in our analysis. Assuming constant variations relative to the standard
values, we find the improved constraints $\alpha_{\rm EM}/\alpha_{\rm EM,0}=0.9993\pm 0.0025$
(CMB only) and $m_{\rm e}/m_{\rm e,0}= 1.0039 \pm 0.0074$ (including BAO) using Planck 2015 data.
For a redshift-dependent variation, $\alpha_{\rm EM}(z)=\alpha_{\rm EM}(z_0)\,[(1+z)/1100]^p$
with $\alpha_{\rm EM}(z_0)\equiv\alpha_{\rm EM,0}$ at $z_0=1100$, we obtain $p=0.0008\pm 0.0025$.
Allowing simultaneous variations of $\alpha_{\rm EM}(z_0)$ and $p$ yields $\alpha_{\rm EM}(z_0)/\alpha_{\rm
EM,0} = 0.9998\pm 0.0036$ and $p = 0.0006\pm 0.0036$. We also discuss combined limits on $\alpha_{\rm
EM}$ and $m_{\rm e}$. Our analysis shows that existing data is not only sensitive to the value of the
fundamental constants around recombination but also its first time derivative. This suggests
that a wider class of varying fundamental constant models can be probed using the CMB.
