In this paper we compare the construction of equilibrium states at finite temperature for self-interacting
massive scalar quantum field theories on Minkowski spacetime proposed by Fredenhagen and Lindner
with results obtained in ordinary thermal field theory, by means of real time and Matsubara formalisms.
In the construction of this state, even if the adiabatic limit is considered, the interaction Lagrangian
is multiplied by a smooth time cut-off. In this way the interaction starts adiabatically and the
correlation functions are free from divergences. The corresponding interaction Hamiltonian
is a local interacting field smeared over the interval of time where the chosen cut-off is not constant.
In order to cope with this smearing, the Matsubara propagator needs to be modified. We obtain an expansion
of the correlation functions of the interacting equilibrium state as a sum over certain type of graphs
with mixed edges, some of them correspond to modified Matsubara propagators and others to propagators
of the real time formalism. An integration over the adiabatic time cut-off is present in every vertex.
However, at every order in perturbation theory, the final result does not depend on the particular
form of the cut-off function. The obtained graphical expansion contains in it both the real time
formalism and the Matsubara formalism as particular cases. Finally, we show that a particular factorisation
which is used to derive the ordinary real time formalism holds only in special cases and we present
a counterexample. We conclude with the analysis of certain correlation functions and we notice
that corrections to the self-energy in a $\lambda\phi^4$ at finite temperature theory are expected.
