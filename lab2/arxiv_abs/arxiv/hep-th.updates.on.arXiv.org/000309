The lorentzian CR-structure (LCR-structure) is a special 4-dimensional totally real CR-structure,
which contains two correlated 3-dimensional CR-structures. It is defined by explicit Cartan relations
and characterized by the "left" and "right" CP3 points with two spinors and two Newman complex trajectories.
Using a gauge field action, which depends on this LCR-structure and not the metric, a 4-dimensional
pseudo-conformal field theory (PCFT) is formulated. It is invariant under the two Cartan infinite
dimensional Lie algebras of the contained 3-dimensional CR-structures, in complete analogy to
the 2-dimensional CFT. These algebras do not assume central charges. "Open" and "closed" LCR-manifolds
are defined in analogy to the 2-dimensional string theory. The states and transition amplitudes
of the PCFT model are defined using the path-integral formalism as functional integrations over
the LCR-structures, where a summation over the structure relative invariants has to be considered
in addition to the ordinary summation over the topological invariants of the LCR-manifolds. The
gauge field propagator in the sector of the "open" degenerate LCR-structure is computed and found
to be confining. Using the Elie Cartan list of automorphisms of the 3-dimensinal CR-structures,
the automorphisms of the LCR-structures are investigated. The Poincar\'e group is an automorphism
of the degenerate LCR-structure which is considered as the vacuum. The "left" and "right" spinors
of the vacuum LCR-structure transform under the corresponding non-equivalent conjugate representations
of the Lorentz group. The electron-positron with electromagnetic and gravitational radiations
is identified as the Kerr-Newman LCR-manifold and the general phenomenological framework is outlined.
