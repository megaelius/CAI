In this work we obtain the Hamiltonian description of the Supermembrane theory formulated in the
Light Cone Gauge (L.C.G.) on $M_9\times T^2$ background with constant bosonic three-forms $C_{\pm
ab}$. We analyze three different cases depending on the particular values of the constants $(C_{+ab},C_{-ab})$.
When it is imposed a 2-form flux condition over $C_+$ and vanishing $C_-$, it coincides with the Halmiltonian
of a supermembrane theory irreducibly wrapped around the 2-torus with a vanishing three-form $C_{\mu\nu\rho}=0$,
shifted by a constant term. The 2-torus target space flux condition of the first theory induces by
a pullback a worldvolume flux that can be identified with the topological invariant associated
to the irreducibility of the wrapping condition that appears in the second theory considered. Both
theories exhibit a nonvanishing central charge condition in the algebra. The M2-brane theory with
constant $C_+$ exhibits discreteness of the supersymetric spectrum as the theory of irreducible
wrapping does, in distinction with the M2-brane case with $C_+\ne 0$ and vanishing flux condition
that has continuous spectrum. We also obtain the Hamiltonian description and constraints of the
Supermembrane theory for the case of $C_-\ne 0$. This case is more subtle due to the role of $X^-$ component
in the constraint. With a proper redefinition of the canonical variables the $X^-$ can be decoupled
for $C_+=0$ as well as for the case $C_+\ne 0$. The spectral analysis of these two cases deserves an
independent study outside of the scope of the present paper. One of the backgrounds considered here
coincides with the asymptotic limit of a supergravity solution generated by an M2-brane acting
as a source.
