Recently, the accordiohedron in kinematic space is proposed as the positive geometry for planar
tree-level scattering amplitudes in the $\phi^p$ theory in \cite{Raman:2019utu}. The scattering
amplitudes are given as a sum over canonical forms of some accordiohedra with appropriate weights.
These weights are determined from the condition that when summed over all canonical forms, the residue
of each pole is unit. Once we choose these weights from this condition, the sum of canonical forms
corresponds to the scattering amplitude. This condition relied on the form of scattering amplitudes.
In this paper, we show that these weights are completely determined by the factorization property
of the accordiohedron. This means that the geometry of the accordiohedron is enough to determine
these weights. We can also see that the above condition can be interpreted as one of the conditions
which are obtained from the factorization. In addition to this, we study one-parameter recursion
relations for the $\phi^p$ amplitudes. The one-parameter "BCFW"-like recursion relation for
the $\phi^3$ amplitudes was obtained from the triangulation of the ABHY-associahedron \cite{Arkani-Hamed:2017tmz}.
After this, a new recursion relation was proposed from the projecting triangulation of the generalized
ABHY-associahedron in \cite{Arkani-Hamed:2019vag, Yang:2019esm}. We generalize these one-parameter
recursion relations to the $\phi^p$ amplitudes and interpret as triangulations of the accordiohedra.
We show that the BCFW-like recursion of the $\phi^p$ amplitude can be interpreted as the inside triangulation
of the accordiohedra. By using the general formula of the triangulation, we obtain an all-multiplicity
result for the $\phi^p$ amplitude. We also apply the new recursion relation to the $\phi^p$ amplitudes.
