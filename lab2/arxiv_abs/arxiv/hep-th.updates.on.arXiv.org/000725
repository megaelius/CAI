We revisit the issue of dynamical returns reminiscent of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) paradox in
weakly nonlinear dynamics of global AdS_4 perturbations. Recent studies of related systems involving
probe fields in AdS (and of the nonrelativistic limit of AdS resulting in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation)
have revealed a number of cases where analogous dynamical returns for two-mode initial data are
exact. Motivated by these parallels, we numerically re-examine gravitationally backreacting
perturbations in AdS_4 with higher precision than the previous treatments and for a range of initial
data, and discover returns that are so accurate that it is tantalizing to sign off the small imperfections
as an artifact of numerics. To clarify the situation, we specifically focus on solutions with spectra
localized around one of the two lowest modes, for which a systematic analytic treatment is possible.
This approach excludes exact returns for such initial data, and confirms (at a level much more striking
than what has been previously seen) the status of the observed very accurate but imperfect returns
as an FPU-type phenomenon. Our analysis of solutions dominated by one of the two lowest modes also
provides an explanation for specific integer numbers of direct-reverse cascade sequences that
result in particularly accurate energy returns (such returns furthermore become more and more
precise if one waits for appropriate longer multiple periods in this manner). In addition, we explain,
at least in this regime, the ubiquitous appearance of direct-reverse cascades in the weakly nonlinear
dynamics of AdS-like systems. The FPU nature of the observed returns makes it natural to look for
a deformation of the weakly nonlinear AdS dynamics that makes the returns exact, and we briefly comment
on possible strategies for such searches.
