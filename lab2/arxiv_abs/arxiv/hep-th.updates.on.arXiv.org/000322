We review a recently proposed effective Tolman temperature and present its applications to various
gravitational systems. In the Unruh state for the evaporating black holes, the free-fall energy
density is found to be negative divergent at the horizon, which is in contrast to the conventional
calculations performed in the Kruskal coordinates. We resolve this conflict by invoking that the
Kruskcal coordinates could be no longer proper coordinates at the horizon. In the Hartle-Hawking-Israel
state, despite the negative finite proper energy density at the horizon, the Tolman temperature
is divergent there due to the infinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. However, a consistent
Stefan-Boltzmann law with the Hawking radiation shows that the effective Tolman temperature is
eventually finite everywhere and the equivalence principle is surprisingly restored at the horizon.
Then, we also show that the firewall necessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum, so that the Tolman
temperature in the evaporating black hole is naturally divergent due to the infinitely blueshifted
negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon, whereas the outgoing Hawking radiation characterized
by the effective Tolman temperature indeed originates from the quantum atmosphere, not just at
the horizon. So, the firewall and the atmosphere for the Hawking radiation turn out to be compatible,
once we discard the fact that the Hawking radiation in the Unruh state originates from the infinitely
blueshifted outgoing excitations at the horizon. Finally, as a cosmological application, the
initial radiation energy density in warm inflation scenarios has been assumed to be finite when
inflation starts. We successfully find the origin of the non-vanishing initial radiation energy
density in the warm inflation by using the effective Tolman temperature.
