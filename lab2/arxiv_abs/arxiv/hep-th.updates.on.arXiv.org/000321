The spectral problem for the ${\rm AdS}_5\times {\rm S}^5$ superstring and its dual planar maximally
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be efficiently solved through a set of functional equations
known as the quantum spectral curve. We discuss how the same concepts apply to the $\eta$-deformed
${\rm AdS}_5\times {\rm S}^5$ superstring, an integrable deformation of the ${\rm AdS}_5\times
{\rm S}^5$ superstring with quantum group symmetry. This model can be viewed as a trigonometric
version of the ${\rm AdS}_5\times {\rm S}^5$ superstring, like the relation between the XXZ and
XXX spin chains, or the sausage and the ${\rm S}^2$ sigma models for instance. We derive the quantum
spectral curve for the $\eta$-deformed string by reformulating the corresponding ground-state
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations as an analytic $Y$ system, and map this to an analytic $T$ system
which upon suitable gauge fixing leads to a $\mathbf{P} \mu$ system -- the quantum spectral curve.
We then discuss constraints on the asymptotics of this system to single out particular excited states.
At the spectral level the $\eta$-deformed string and its quantum spectral curve interpolate between
the ${\rm AdS}_5\times {\rm S}^5$ superstring and a superstring on "mirror" ${\rm AdS}_5\times
{\rm S}^5$, reflecting a more general relationship between the spectral and thermodynamic data
of the $\eta$-deformed string. In particular, the spectral problem of the mirror ${\rm AdS}_5\times
{\rm S}^5$ string, and the thermodynamics of the undeformed ${\rm AdS}_5\times {\rm S}^5$ string,
are described by a second rational limit of our trigonometric quantum spectral curve, distinct
from the regular undeformed limit.
