There are several 3+1 parameter quantities in physics (like vector + scalar potentials, 4-currents,
space-time, 4-momentum). In most cases (but space-time), the 3- and the 1-parameter characterised
elements of these quantities differ in the field-sources (e.g., inertial and gravitational masses,
Lorentz- and Coulomb-type electric charges) associated with them. The members of the field-source
pairs appear in the vector- and the scalar potentials, respectively. Sec. 1 and 2 present an algebra
what demonstrates that the members of the field-source siblings are subjects of an invariance group
that can transform them into each other. (This includes, the conservation of the isotopic field-charge
spin, proven in previous publications.) The paper identifies the algebra of that transformation
and characterises the group of the invariance, it discusses the properties of this group, shows
how they can be classified in the known nomenclature, and why is this pseudo-unitary group isomorphic
with the SU(2) group. This algebra is denoted by tau. The invariance group generated by the tau algebra
is called hypersymmetry (HySy). The group of HySy had not been described. The defined symmetry group
is able to make correspondence between scalars and vector components that appear often coupled
in the characterisation of physical states. In accordance with conclusions in previous papers,
the second part (Sec. 3 and 4) shows that the equations describing the individual fundamental physical
interacions are invariant under the combined application of the Lorentz transformation and the
here explored invariance group at high energy approximation (while they are left intact at lower
energies). As illustration, the paper presents a simple form for an extended Dirac equation and
a set of matrices to describe the combined transformation in QED. Sec. 2.2 shows applicability of
this algebra for genetic matrices.
