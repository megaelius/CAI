We constrain tilted spatially-flat and untilted non-flat XCDM dynamical dark energy inflation
parameterizations with the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and
recent Type Ia supernovae measurements, baryonic acoustic oscillations data, growth rate observations,
and Hubble parameter measurements. Inclusion of the four non-CMB data sets leads to a significant
strengthening of the evidence for non-flatness in the non-flat XCDM model from 1.1$\sigma$ for
the CMB data alone to 3.4$\sigma$ for the full data combination. In this untilted non-flat XCDM case
the data favor a spatially-closed model in which spatial curvature contributes a little less than
a percent of the current cosmological energy budget; they also mildy favor dynamical dark energy
over a cosmological constant at 1.2$\sigma$. These data are also better fit by the flat-XCDM parameterization
than by the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but only at 0.6$\sigma$ significance. Current data is
unable to rule out dark energy dynamics. The non-flat XCDM parameterization is more consistent
with the Dark Energy Survey constraints on the current value of the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations
($\sigma_8$) as a function of the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter
($\Omega_m$) but does not provide as good a fit to the smaller-angle CMB anisotropy data as does the
standard tilted flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. Some measured cosmological parameter values differ
significantly when determined using the tilted flat-XCDM and the non-flat XCDM parameterizations,
including the baryonic matter density parameter and the reionization optical depth.
