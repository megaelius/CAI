The Cachazo-Strominger subleading soft graviton theorem for a positive helicity soft graviton
is equivalent to the Ward identities for $\overline{SL(2,\mathbb C)}$ currents. This naturally
gives rise to a $\overline{SL(2,\mathbb C)}$ current algebra living on the celestial sphere. The
generators of the $\overline{SL(2,\mathbb C)}$ current algebra and the supertranslations, coming
from a positive helicity leading soft graviton, form a closed algebra. We find that the OPE of two
graviton primaries in the Celestial CFT, extracted from MHV amplitudes, is completely determined
in terms of this algebra. To be more precise, 1) The subleading terms in the OPE are determined in terms
of the leading OPE coefficient if we demand that both sides of the OPE transform in the same way under
this local symmetry algebra. 2) Positive helicity gravitons have null states under this local algebra
whose decoupling leads to differential equations for MHV amplitudes. An $n$ point MHV amplitude
satisfies two systems of $(n-2)$ linear first order PDEs corresponding to $(n-2)$ positive helicity
gravitons. We have checked, using Hodges' formula, that one system of differential equations is
satisfied by any MHV amplitude, whereas the other system has been checked up to six graviton MHV amplitude.
3) One can determine the leading OPE coefficients from these differential equations. This points
to the existence of an autonomous sector of the Celestial CFT which holographically computes the
MHV graviton scattering amplitudes and is completely defined by this local symmetry algebra. The
MHV-sector of the Celestial CFT is like a minimal model of $2$-D CFT.
