We analyze BICEP2 and Planck data using a model that includes CMB lensing, gravity waves, and polarized
dust. Planck dust polarization maps have highlighted the difficulty of estimating the dust polarization
in low intensity regions, suggesting that the polarization fractions have considerable uncertainties
and may be significantly higher than previous predictions. In this paper, we start by assuming nothing
about the dust polarization except for the power spectrum shape, which we take to be $C_{l}^{BB}
\propto l^{-2.42}$. The resulting joint BICEP2+Planck analysis favors solutions without gravity
waves, and the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r<0.11$, a slight improvement relative
to the Planck analysis alone which gives $r<0.13$ (95% c.l.). The estimated amplitude of the
dust polarization power spectrum agrees with expectations for this field based on both HI column
density and Planck polarization measurements at 353 GHz in the BICEP2 field. Including the latter
constraint in our analysis improves the limit further to $r < 0.09$, placing strong constraints
on inflation (e.g., models with $r>0.14$ are excluded with 99.5% confidence). We address the
cross-correlation analysis of BICEP2 at 150 GHz with BICEP1 at 100 GHz as a test of foreground contamination.
We find that the null hypothesis of dust and lensing with $r=0$ gives $\Delta \chi^2<2$ relative
to the hypothesis of no dust, so the frequency analysis does not strongly favor either model over
the other. We also discuss how more accurate dust polarization maps may improve our constraints.
If the dust polarization is measured perfectly, the limit can reach $r<0.05$, but this degrades
quickly to almost no improvement if the dust calibration error is 20% or larger or if the dust maps
are not processed through the BICEP2 pipeline, inducing sampling variance noise. (Abridged.)
