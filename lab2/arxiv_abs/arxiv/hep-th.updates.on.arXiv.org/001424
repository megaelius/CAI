In this note we study IR limits of pure two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with semisimple
non-simply-connected gauge groups including SU(k)/Z_k, SO(2k)/Z_2, Sp(2k)/Z_2, E_6/Z_3, and
E_7/Z_2 for various discrete theta angles, both directly in the gauge theory and also in nonabelian
mirrors, extending a classification begun in previous work. We find in each case that there are supersymmetric
vacua for precisely one value of the discrete theta angle, and no supersymmetric vacua for other
values, hence supersymmetry is broken in the IR for most discrete theta angles. Furthermore, for
the one distinguished value of the discrete theta angle for which supersymmetry is unbroken, the
theory has as many twisted chiral multiplet degrees of freedom in the IR as the rank. We take this opportunity
to further develop the technology of nonabelian mirrors to discuss how the mirror to a G gauge theory
differs from the mirror to a G/K gauge theory for K a subgroup of the center of G. In particular, the
discrete theta angles in these cases are considerably more intricate than those of the pure gauge
theories studied in previous papers, so we discuss the realization of these more complex discrete
theta angles in the mirror construction. We find that discrete theta angles, both in the original
gauge theory and their mirrors, are intimately related to the descriptions of centers of universal
covering groups as quotients of weight lattices by root sublattices. We perform numerous consistency
checks, comparing results against basic group-theoretic relations as well as with decomposition,
which describes how two-dimensional theories with one-form symmetries (such as pure gauge theories
with nontrivial centers) decompose into disjoint unions, in this case of pure gauge theories with
quotiented gauge groups and discrete theta angles.
