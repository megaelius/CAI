Embedding fields provide a way of coupling a background structure to a theory while preserving diffeomorphism-invariance.
Examples of such background structures include embedded submanifolds, such as branes; boundaries
of local subregions, such as the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in holography; and foliations, which appear
in fluid dynamics and force-free electrodynamics. This work presents a systematic framework for
computing geometric properties of these background structures in the embedding field description.
An overview of the local geometric quantities associated with a foliation is given, including a
review of the Gauss, Codazzi, and Ricci-Voss equations, which relate the geometry of the foliation
to the ambient curvature. Generalizations of these equations for curvature in the nonintegrable
normal directions are derived. Particular care is given to the question of which objects are well-defined
for single submanifolds, and which depend on the structure of the foliation away from a submanifold.
Variational formulas are provided for the geometric quantities, which involve contributions
both from the variation of the embedding map as well as variations of the ambient metric. As an application
of these variational formulas, a derivation is given of the Jacobi equation, describing perturbations
of extremal area surfaces of arbitrary codimension. The embedding field formalism is also applied
to the problem of classifying boundary conditions for general relativity in a finite subregion
that lead to integrable Hamiltonians. The framework developed in this paper will provide a useful
set of tools for future analyses of brane dynamics, fluid mechanics, and edge modes for finite subregions
of diffeomorphism-invariant theories.
