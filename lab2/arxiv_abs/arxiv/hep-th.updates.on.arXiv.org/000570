The classification of solutions of the static vacuum Einstein equations, on a given closed manifold
or an asymptotically flat one, is a long-standing and much-studied problem. Solutions are characterized
by a complete Riemannian $n$-manifold $(M,g)$ and a positive function $N$, called the lapse. We
study this problem on Asymptotically Poincar\'e-Einstein $n$-manifolds, $n\ge 3$, when the conformal
boundary-at-infinity is either a round sphere, a flat torus or smooth quotient thereof, or a compact
hyperbolic manifold. Such manifolds have well-defined Wang mass, and are time-symmetric slices
of static, vacuum, asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. By integrating a mildly generalized
form of an identity used by Lindblom, Shen, Wang, and others, we give a mass formula for such manifolds.
In consequence, we observe that either the lapse is trivial and $(M,g)$ is Poincar\'e-Einstein
or the Wang mass is negative, as in the case of time symmetric slices of the AdS soliton. As an application,
we use the mass formula to compute the renormalized volume of the warped product $(X,\gamma) = (M^3,g)
\times_{N^2} (S^1,dt^2)$. We also give a mass formula for the case of a metric that is static in the
region exterior to a horizon on which the lapse function is zero. Then the manifold $(X,\gamma)$
is said to have a "bolt" where the $S^1$ factor shrinks to zero length. The renormalized volume of
$(X,\gamma)$ is expected on physical grounds to have the form of the free energy per unit temperature
for a black hole in equilibrium with a radiation bath at fixed temperature. When $M$ is 3-dimensional
and admits a horizon, we apply this mass formula to compute the renormalized volume of $(X,\gamma)$
and show that it indeed has the expected thermodynamically motivated form.
