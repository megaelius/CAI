We introduce a formalism for describing four-dimensional scattering amplitudes for particles
of any mass and spin. This naturally extends the familiar spinor-helicity formalism for massless
particles to one where these variables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles,
with the amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S tensors. We systematically
characterise all possible three particle amplitudes compatible with Poincare symmetry. Unitarity,
in the form of consistent factorization, imposes algebraic conditions that can be used to construct
all possible four-particle tree amplitudes. This also gives us a convenient basis in which to expand
all possible four-particle amplitudes in terms of what can be called "spinning polynomials". Many
general results of quantum field theory follow the analysis of four-particle scattering, ranging
from the set of all possible consistent theories for massless particles, to spin-statistics, and
the Weinberg-Witten theorem. We also find a transparent understanding for why massive particles
of sufficiently high spin can not be "elementary". The Higgs and Super-Higgs mechanisms are naturally
discovered as an infrared unification of many disparate helicity amplitudes into a smaller number
of massive amplitudes, with a simple understanding for why this can't be extended to Higgsing for
gravitons. We illustrate a number of applications of the formalism at one-loop, giving few-line
computations of the electron (g-2) as well as the beta function and rational terms in QCD. "Off-shell"
observables like correlation functions and form-factors can be thought of as scattering amplitudes
with external "probe" particles of general mass and spin, so all these objects--amplitudes, form
factors and correlators, can be studied from a common on-shell perspective.
