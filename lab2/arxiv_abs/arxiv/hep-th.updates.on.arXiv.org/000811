It has been shown in [32,33] in the framework of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with the assumption of
spatially homogeneous condensates that in the large-$N_{c}$ limit ($N_{c}$ is the number of quark
colours) there exist three dual symmetries of the thermodynamic potential, which describes dense
quark matter with chiral and isospin imbalances. The main duality is between the chiral symmetry
breaking and the charged pion condensation phenomena. There have been a lot of studies and hints
that the ground state could be characterized by spatially inhomogeneous condensates, so the question
arises if duality is a rather deep property of the phase structure or just accidental property in
the homogeneous case. In this paper we have shown that even if the phase diagram contains phases with
spatially inhomogeneous condensates, it still possesses the property of this main duality. Two
other dual symmetries are not realized in the theory if it is investigated within an inhomogeneous
approach to a ground state. From various earlier studied aspects of QCD phase diagram of isospin
asymmetric matter with possible inhomogeneous condensates, in the present paper the unified picture
and full phase diagram of isospin imbalanced dense quark matter have been assembled. Acting on this
diagram by a dual transformation, we obtained, in the framework of an approach with spatially inhomogeneous
condensates and without any calculations, a full phase diagram of chirally asymmetric dense medium.
This example shows that the duality is not just entertaining mathematical property but an instrument
with very high predictivity power. The obtained phase diagram is quite rich and contains various
spatially inhomogeneous phases.
