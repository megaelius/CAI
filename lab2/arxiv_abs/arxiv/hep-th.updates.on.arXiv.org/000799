This paper addresses the problems of quantum spectral curves and 4D limit for the melting crystal
model of 5D SUSY $U(1)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{R}^4\times S^1$. The partition function
$Z(\mathbf{t})$ deformed by an infinite number of external potentials is a tau function of the KP
hierarchy with respect to the coupling constants $\mathbf{t} = (t_1,t_2,\ldots)$. A single-variate
specialization $Z(x)$ of $Z(\mathbf{t})$ satisfies a $q$-difference equation representing
the quantum spectral curve of the melting crystal model. In the limit as the radius $R$ of $S^1$ in
$\mathbb{R}^4\times S^1$ tends to $0$, it turns into a difference equation for a 4D counterpart
$Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(X)$ of $Z(x)$. This difference equation reproduces the quantum spectral curve
of Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{CP}^1$. $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(X)$ is obtained from $Z(x)$ by
letting $R \to 0$ under an $R$-dependent transformation $x = x(X,R)$ of $x$ to $X$. A similar prescription
of 4D limit can be formulated for $Z(\mathbf{t})$ with an $R$-dependent transformation $\mathbf{t}
= \mathbf{t}(\mathbf{T},R)$ of $\mathbf{t}$ to $\mathbf{T} = (T_1,T_2,\ldots)$. This yields
a 4D counterpart $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$ of $Z(\mathbf{t})$. $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$
agrees with a generating function of all-genus Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{CP}^1$.
Fay-type bilinear equations for $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$ can be derived from similar equations
satisfied by $Z(\mathbf{t})$. The bilinear equations imply that $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T})$,
too, is a tau function of the KP hierarchy. These results are further extended to deformations $Z(\mathbf{t},s)$
and $Z_{\mathrm{4D}}(\mathbf{T},s)$ by a discrete variable $s \in \mathbb{Z}$, which are shown
to be tau functions of the 1D Toda hierarchy.
