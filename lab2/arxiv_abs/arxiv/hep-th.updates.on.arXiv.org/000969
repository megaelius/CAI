Modifications of General Relativity leave their imprint both on the cosmic expansion history through
a non-trivial dark energy equation of state, and on the evolution of cosmological perturbations
in the scalar and in the tensor sectors. In particular, the modification in the tensor sector gives
rise to a notion of gravitational-wave (GW) luminosity distance, different from the standard electromagnetic
luminosity distance, that can be studied with standard sirens at GW detectors such as LISA or third-generation
ground based experiments. We discuss the predictions for modified GW propagation from some of the
best studied theories of modified gravity, such as Horndeski or the more general degenerate higher
order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories, non-local infrared modifications of gravity, bigravity
theories and the corresponding phenomenon of GW oscillation, as well as theories with extra or varying
dimensions. We show that modified GW propagation is a completely generic phenomenon in modified
gravity. We then use a simple parametrization of the effect in terms of two parameters $(\Xi_0,n)$,
that is shown to fit well the results from a large class of models, to study the prospects of observing
modified GW propagation using supermassive black hole binaries as standard sirens with LISA. We
construct mock source catalogs and perform detailed Markov Chain Monte Carlo studies of the likelihood
obtained from LISA standard sirens alone, as well as by combining them with CMB, BAO and SNe data to
reduce the degeneracies between cosmological parameters. We find that the combination of LISA
with the other cosmological datasets allows one to measure the parameter $\Xi_0$ that characterizes
modified GW propagation to the percent level accuracy, sufficient to test several modified gravity
theories. [Abridged]
