A new class of modified theories of gravity, consisting of the superposition of the metric Einstein-Hilbert
Lagrangian with an $f(\cal R)$ term constructed \`{a} la Palatini was proposed recently. The dynamically
equivalent scalar-tensor representation of the model was also formulated, and it was shown that
even if the scalar field is very light, the theory passes the Solar System observational constraints.
Therefore the model predicts the existence of a long-range scalar field, modifying the cosmological
and galactic dynamics. An explicit model that passes the local tests and leads to cosmic acceleration
was also obtained. In the present work, it is shown that the theory can be also formulated in terms
of the quantity $X\equiv \kappa^2 T+R$, where T and R are the traces of the stress-energy and Ricci
tensors, respectively. The variable X represents the deviation with respect to the field equation
trace of general relativity. The cosmological applications of this hybrid metric-Palatini gravitational
theory are also explored, and cosmological solutions coming from the scalar-tensor representation
of f(X)-gravity are presented. Criteria to obtain cosmic acceleration are discussed and the field
equations are analyzed as a dynamical system. Several classes of dynamical cosmological solutions,
depending on the functional form of the effective scalar field potential, describing both accelerating
and decelerating Universes are explicitly obtained. Furthermore, the cosmological perturbation
equations are derived and applied to uncover the nature of the propagating scalar degree of freedom
and the signatures these models predict in the large-scale structure.
