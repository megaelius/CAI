We systematically investigate shear-free cosmological models realized by p-form gauge fields;
a scenario in which anisotropic spatial sections expand isotropically with expansion histories
equivalent to standard FLRW models. Specifically, we present a complete list of general relativistic
shear-free solutions in a class of anisotropic, spatially homogeneous and orthogonal cosmological
models containing a collection of $n$ independent $p$-form gauge fields, where $p\in\{0,1,2,3\}$,
in addidtion to standard LCDM matter fields modelled as perfect fluids. Here a (collection of) gauge
field(s) balances anisotropic spatial curvature on the right-hand side of the shear propagation
equation. The result is a class of solutions dynamically equivalent to standard FLRW cosmologies,
with an effective curvature constant $K_\text{eff}$ that depends both on spatial curvature and
the energy density of the gauge field(s). In the case of a single gauge field ($n=1$) we show that the
only spacetimes that admit such solutions are the LRS Bianchi type III, Bianchi type VI$_0$ and Kantowski-Sachs
metric, which are dynamically equivalent to open ($K_\text{eff}<0$), flat ($K_\text{eff}=0$)
and closed ($K_\text{eff}>0$) FLRW models, respectively. With a collection of gauge fields ($n>1$)
also Bianchi type II admits a shear-free solution ($K_\text{eff}>0$). We identify the LRS Bianchi
type III solution to be the unique shear-free solution with a gauge field Hamiltonian bounded from
below in the entire class of models. This is a generalization and unification of the shear-free solutions
discovered by Carneiro et. al. (2001) with a massless scalar field and by Koivisto et. al. (2011)
with a 2-form gauge field, which we show are physically equivalent at the field strength $p+1$ level.
Along the way we develop strategies and a framework that can be utilized in a broader class of models.
