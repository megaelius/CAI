We investigate the supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majorana fermions with
infinite range interactions in $0+1$ dimensions. We have found that, close to the ground state $E
\approx 0$, discrete symmetries alter qualitatively the spectral properties with respect to the
non-supersymmetric SYK model. The average spectral density at finite $N$, which we compute analytically
and numerically, grows exponentially with $N$ for $E \approx 0$. However the chiral condensate,
which is normalized with respect the total number of eigenvalues, vanishes in the thermodynamic
limit. Slightly above $E \approx 0$, the spectral density grows exponential with the energy. Deep
in the quantum regime, corresponding to the first $O(N)$ eigenvalues, the average spectral density
is universal and well described by random matrix ensembles with chiral and superconducting discrete
symmetries. The dynamics for $E \approx 0$ is investigated by level fluctuations. Also in this case
we find excellent agreement with the prediction of chiral and superconducting random matrix ensembles
for eigenvalues separations smaller than the Thouless energy, which seems to scale linearly with
$N$. Deviations beyond the Thouless energy, which describes how ergodicity is approached, are
universality characterized by a quadratic growth of the number variance. In the time domain, we
have found analytically that the spectral form factor $g(t)$, obtained from the connected two-level
correlation function of the unfolded spectrum, decays as $1/t^2$ for times shorter but comparable
to the Thouless time with $g(0)$ related to the coefficient of the quadratic growth of the number
variance. Our results provide further support that quantum black holes are ergodic and therefore
can be classified by random matrix theory.
