The main objective of this paper is to analyze the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum
tensor (EMT) associated with a charged scalar quantum field in a high-dimensional cosmic string
spacetime admitting the presence of a magnetic flux running along the string's core. In addition,
we also assume that the coordinate along the string's axis is compactified to a circle and presents
an extra magnetic flux running along its center. This compactification is implemented by imposing
a quasiperiodic condition on the field with an arbitrary phase $\beta$. The calculation of the VEV
of the EMT and field squared, are developed by using the positive-energy Wightman function. The
latter is constructed by the mode sum of the complete set of normalized bosonic wave-functions.
Due to the compactification, two distinct contributions take place. The first one corresponds
to the VEV in a cosmic string spacetime without compactification considering the magnetic interaction.
So, this term presents a contribution due to the non-trivial topology of the conical space, and an
additional contribution due to the interaction between the scalar field with the magnetic flux.
The latter is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with period equal to the quantum flux, $\Phi_0=2\pi/e$,
and corresponds to a Aharanov-Bhom type contribution. The second contribution is induced by the
compactification itself and depends on the magnetic flux along the string's core. It is also an even
function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the string axis. Some asymptotic expressions for the VEVs
of the energy-momentum tensor and field squared are provided for specific limiting cases of the
physical parameter of the model.
