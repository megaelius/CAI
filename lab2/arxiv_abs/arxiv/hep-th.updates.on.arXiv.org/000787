The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model describes a strange metal that shows peculiar non-Fermi liquid
properties without quasiparticles. It exhibits a maximally chaotic behavior characterized by
out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and is expected to be a holographic dual to black holes.
Recently, a striking similarity between the SYK model and the Hund-coupling induced spin-freezing
crossover in multi-orbital Hubbard models has been pointed out. To further explore this connection,
we study OTOCs for fermionic Hubbard models, which are prototypical models for strongly correlated
electrons in solids. We introduce an imaginary-time four-point correlation function with an appropriate
time ordering, which by means of the spectral representation and the out-of-time-order fluctuation-dissipation
theorem can be analytically continued to real-time OTOCs. Based on this approach, we numerically
evaluate real-time OTOCs for Hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit, using the dynamical mean-field
theory in combination with a numerically exact continuous-time Monte Carlo impurity solver. The
results for the single-orbital model show that a certain spin-related OTOC captures local moment
formation in the vicinity of the metal-insulator transition, while the self-energy does not show
SYK-like non-Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, for the two- and three-orbital models with
nonzero Hund coupling we find that the OTOC exhibits a rapid damping at short times and an approximate
power-law decay at longer times in the spin-freezing crossover regime characterized by fluctuating
local moments and a non-Fermi liquid self-energy $\Sigma(\omega) \sim \sqrt{\omega}$. These
results are in a good agreement with the behavior of the SYK model, providing firm evidence for the
close relation between the spin-freezing crossover physics of multi-orbital Hubbard models and
the SYK strange metal.
