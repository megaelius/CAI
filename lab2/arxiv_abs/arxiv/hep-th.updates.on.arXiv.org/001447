We study the inflationary phenomenology of a non-minimally coupled Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity
theory, in the presence of a scalar potential, under the condition that the gravitational wave speed
of the primordial gravitational waves is equal to unity, that is $c_T^2=1$, in natural units. The
equations of motion, which are derived directly from the gravitational action, form a system of
differential equations with respect to Hubble's parameter and the inflaton field which are very
complicated and cannot be solved analytically, even in the minimal coupling case. In this paper,
we present a variety of different approximations which could be used, along with the constraint
$c_T^2=1$, in order to produce an inflationary phenomenology compatible with recent observations.
All the different approaches are able to lead to viable results if the model coupling functions obey
simple relations, however, different approaches contain different approximations which must
be obeyed during the first horizon crossing, in order for the model to be rendered correct. Models
which may lead to a non-viable phenomenology are presented as well in order to understand better
the inner framework of this theory. Furthermore, since the velocity of the gravitational waves
is set equal to $c_T^2=1$, as stated by the striking event of GW170817 recently, the non-minimal
coupling function, the Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling and the scalar potential are related to each
other. Here, we shall assume no particular form of the scalar potential and we choose freely the scalar
functions coupled to the Ricci scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. Certain models are also studied
in order to assess the phenomenological validity of the theory, but we need to note that all approximations
must hold true in order for a particular model to be valid.
