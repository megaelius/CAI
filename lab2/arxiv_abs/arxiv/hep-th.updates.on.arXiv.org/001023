We study the covariant phase space of vacuum general relativity at the null boundary of causal diamonds.
The past and future components of such a null boundary each have an infinite-dimensional symmetry
algebra consisting of diffeomorphisms of the $2$-sphere and boost supertranslations corresponding
to angle-dependent rescalings of affine parameter along the null generators. Associated to these
symmetries are charges and fluxes obtained from the covariant phase space formalism using the prescription
of Wald and Zoupas. By analyzing the behavior of the spacetime metric near the corners of the causal
diamond, we show that the fluxes are also Hamiltonian generators of the symmetries on the phase space.
In particular, the supertranslation fluxes yield an infinite family of boost Hamiltonians acting
on the gravitational data of causal diamonds. We show that the smoothness of the vector fields representing
such symmetries at the bifurcation edge of the causal diamond implies suitable matching conditions
between the symmetries on the past and future components of the null boundary. Similarly, the smoothness
of the spacetime metric implies that the fluxes of all such symmetries is conserved between the past
and future components of the null boundary. This establishes an infinite set of conservation laws
for finite subregions in gravity analogous to those at null infinity. We also show that the symmetry
algebra at the causal diamond has a non-trivial center corresponding to constant boosts. The central
charges associated to these constant boosts are proportional to the area of the bifurcation edge,
for any causal diamond, in analogy with the Wald entropy formula.
