We consider the lattice formulation of SO(10) chiral gauge theory with left-handed Weyl fermions
in the sixteen dimensional spinor representation ($\underline{16}$) within the framework of
the Overlap fermion/the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. We define a manifestly gauge-invariant path-integral
measure for the left-handed Weyl field using all the components of the Dirac field, but the right-handed
part of which is just saturated completely by inserting a suitable product of the SO(10)-invariant
't Hooft vertices in terms of the right-handed field. The definition of the measure applies to all
possible topological sectors. The measure possesses all required transformation properties
under lattice symmetries and the induced effective action is CP invariant. The global U(1) symmetry
of the left-handed field is anomalous due to the non-trivial transformation of the measure, while
that of the right-handed field is explicitly broken by the 't Hooft vertices. There remains the issue
of locality in the gauge-field dependence of the Weyl fermion measure, but the question can be addressed
in the weak gauge-coupling expansion at least using Monte Carlo methods without encountering the
sign problem. We also discuss the relations of our formulation to other approaches/proposals to
decouple the species-doubling/mirror degrees of freedom. Those include Eichten-Preskill model,
Ginsparg-Wilson Mirror-fermion model, Domain wall fermion model with the boundary Eichten-Preskill
term, 4D Topological Insulator/Superconductor with gapped boundary phase, and the recent studies
on the PMS phase/"Mass without symmetry breaking". We clarify the similarity and the difference
in technical detail and show that our proposal is a well-defined testing ground for that basic question.
