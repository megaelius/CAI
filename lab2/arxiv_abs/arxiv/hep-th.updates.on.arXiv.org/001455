In this second paper of the series we continue to spell out a new program for quantum gravity, grounded
in the notion of corner symmetry algebra and its representations. Here we focus on tetrad gravity
and its corner symplectic potential. We start by performing a detailed decomposition of the various
geometrical quantities appearing in BF theory and tetrad gravity. This provides a new decomposition
of the symplectic potential of BF theory and the simplicity constraints. We then show that the dynamical
variables of the tetrad gravity corner phase space are the internal normal to the spacetime foliation,
which is conjugated to the boost generator, and the corner coframe field. This allows us to derive
several key results. First, we construct the corner Lorentz charges. In addition to sphere diffeomorphisms,
common to all formulations of gravity, these charges add a local $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$
component to the corner symmetry algebra of tetrad gravity. Second, we also reveal that the corner
metric satisfies a local $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra, whose Casimir corresponds
to the corner area element. Due to the space-like nature of the corner metric, this Casimir belongs
to the unitary discrete series, and its spectrum is therefore quantized. This result, which reconciles
discreteness of the area spectrum with Lorentz invariance, is proven in the continuum and without
resorting to a bulk connection. Third, we show that the corner phase space explains why the simplicity
constraints become non-commutative on the corner. This fact requires a reconciliation between
the bulk and corner symplectic structures, already in the classical continuum theory. Understanding
this leads inevitably to the introduction of edge modes.
