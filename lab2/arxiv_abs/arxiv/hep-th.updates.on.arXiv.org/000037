We use localization to evaluate the functional integral of string field theory on AdS_2xS^2 background
corresponding to the near horizon geometry of supersymmetric black holes in 4d compactifications
with N=2 supersymmetry. In particular, for a theory containing n_v + 1 vector multiplets, we show
that the functional integral localizes exactly onto an ordinary integral over a finite-dimensional
submanifold in the field space labeling a continuous family of instanton solutions in which auxiliary
fields in the vector multiplets are excited with nontrivial dependence on AdS_2 coordinates. These
localizing solutions are universal in that they follow from the off-shell supersymmetry transformations
and do not depend on the choice of the action. They are parametrized by n_v +1 real parameters C^I,
; I= 0,..., n_v that correspond to the values of the auxiliary fields at the center of AdS_2. In the
Type-IIA frame, assuming D-terms evaluate to zero on the solutions for reasons of supersymmetry,
the classical part of the integrand equals the absolute square of the partition function of the topological
string as conjectured by Ooguri, Strominger, and Vafa; however evaluated at the off-shell values
of scalar fields at the center of AdS_2. In addition, there are contributions from one-loop determinants,
brane-instantons, and nonperturbative orbifolds that are in principle computable. These results
thus provide a concrete method to compute exact quantum entropy of these black holes including all
perturbative and nonperturbative corrections and can be used to establish a precise relation between
the quantum degeneracies of black holes and the topological string.
