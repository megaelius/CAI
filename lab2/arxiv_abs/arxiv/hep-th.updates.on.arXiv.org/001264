Forty-six years after the birth of supersymmetry in 1973 from works of Julius Wess and Bruno Zumino,
the standard quantum-field-theorists and particle physicists' language of `superspaces', `supersymmetry',
and `supersymmetric action functionals in superspace formulation' as given in Chapters IV, V,
VI, VII, XXII of the classic on supersymmetry and supergravity: Julius Wess & Jonathan Bagger: Supersymmetry
and Supergravity (2nd ed.), is finally polished, with only minimal mathematical patches added
for consistency and accuracy in dealing with nilpotent objects from the Grassmann algebra involved,
to a precise setting in the language of complexified ${\Bbb Z}/2$-graded $C^\infty$-Algebraic
Geometry. This is completed after the lesson learned from D(14.1) (arXiv:1808.05011 [math.DG])
and the notion of `$d=3+1$, $N=1$ towered superspaces' as complexified ${\Bbb Z}/2$-graded $C^\infty$-schemes,
their distinguished sectors, and purge-evaluation maps first developed in SUSY(1) (= D(14.1.Supp.1))
(arXiv:1902.06246 [hep-th]) and further polished in the current work. While the construction
depends on a choice of a trivialization of the spinor bundle by covariantly constant sections, as
long as the transformation law and the induced isomorphism under a change of trivialization of the
spinor bundle by covariantly constant sections are understood, any object or structure thus defined
or constructed is mathematically well-defined. The construction can be generalized to all other
space-time dimensions with simple or extended supersymmetries. This is part of the mathematical
foundation required to study fermionic D-branes in the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz formulation.
