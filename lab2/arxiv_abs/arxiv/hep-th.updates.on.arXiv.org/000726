In this paper we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to refine and then establish a set of old conjectures
about symmetries in quantum gravity. We first show that any global symmetry, discrete or continuous,
in a bulk quantum gravity theory with a CFT dual would lead to an inconsistency in that CFT, and thus
that there are no bulk global symmetries in AdS/CFT. We then argue that any "long-range" bulk gauge
symmetry leads to a global symmetry in the boundary CFT, whose consistency requires the existence
of bulk dynamical objects which transform in all finite-dimensional irreducible representations
of the bulk gauge group. We mostly assume that all internal symmetry groups are compact, but we also
give a general condition on CFTs, which we expect to be true quite broadly, which implies this. We
extend all of these results to the case of higher-form symmetries. Finally we extend a recently proposed
new motivation for the weak gravity conjecture to more general gauge groups, reproducing the "convex
hull condition" of Cheung and Remmen. An essential point, which we dwell on at length, is precisely
defining what we mean by gauge and global symmetries in the bulk and boundary. Quantum field theory
results we meet while assembling the necessary tools include continuous global symmetries without
Noether currents, new perspectives on spontaneous symmetry-breaking and 't Hooft anomalies,
a new order parameter for confinement which works in the presence of fundamental quarks, a Hamiltonian
lattice formulation of gauge theories with arbitrary discrete gauge groups, an extension of the
Coleman-Mandula theorem to discrete symmetries, and an improved explanation of the decay $\pi^0\to\gamma
\gamma$ in the standard model of particle physics. We also describe new black hole solutions of the
Einstein equation in $d+1$ dimensions with horizon topology $\mathbb{T}^p\times \mathbb{S}^{d-p-1}$.
