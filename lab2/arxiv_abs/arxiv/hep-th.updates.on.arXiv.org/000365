Tree and loop level scattering amplitudes which involve physical massless bosons are derived directly
from physical constraints such as locality, symmetry and unitarity, bypassing path integral constructions.
Amplitudes can be projected onto a minimal basis of kinematic factors through linear algebra, by
employing four dimensional spinor helicity methods or at its most general using projection techniques.
The linear algebra analysis is closely related to amplitude relations, especially the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson
relations for gluon amplitudes and the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations between gluons and graviton
amplitudes. Projection techniques are known to reduce the computation of loop amplitudes with
spinning particles to scalar integrals. Unitarity, locality and integration-by-parts identities
can then be used to fix complete tree and loop amplitudes efficiently. The loop amplitudes follow
algorithmically from the trees. A range of proof-of-concept examples is presented. These include
the planar four point two-loop amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory as well as a range of one loop amplitudes
with internal and external scalars, gluons and gravitons. Several interesting features of the
results are highlighted, such as the vanishing of certain basis coefficients for gluon and graviton
amplitudes. Effective field theories are naturally and efficiently included into the framework.
The presented methods appear most powerful in non-supersymmetric theories in cases with relatively
few legs, but with potentially many loops. For instance, iterated unitarity cuts of four point amplitudes
for non-supersymmetric gauge and gravity theories can be computed by matrix multiplication, generalising
the so-called rung-rule of maximally supersymmetric theories. The philosophy of the approach
to kinematics also leads to a technique to control color quantum numbers of scattering amplitudes
with matter.
