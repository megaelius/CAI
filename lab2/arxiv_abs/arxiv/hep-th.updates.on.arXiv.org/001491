We present a unified framework for the renormalisation of the Hamiltonian and eigenbasis of a system
of correlated electrons, unveiling thereby the interplay between electronic correlations and
many-particle entanglement. For this, we extend substantially the unitary renormalization group
(URG) scheme introduced in Refs.\cite{anirbanmotti,anirbanmott2,mukherjee2020}. We recast
the RG as a discrete flow of the Hamiltonian tensor network, i.e., the collection of various $2n$-point
scattering vertex tensors comprising the Hamiltonian. The renormalisation progresses via unitary
transformations that block diagonalizes the Hamiltonian iteratively via the disentanglement
of single-particle eigenstates. This procedure incorporates naturally the role of quantum fluctuations.
The RG flow equations possess a non-trivial structure, displaying a feedback mechanism through
frequency-dependent dynamical self-energies and correlation energies. The interplay between
various UV energy scales enables the coupled RG equations to flow towards a stable fixed point in
the IR. The effective Hamiltonian at the IR fixed point generically has a reduced parameter space,
as well as number of degrees of freedom, compared to the microscopic Hamiltonian. Importantly,
the vertex tensor network is observed to govern the RG flow of the tensor network that denotes the
coefficients of the many-particle eigenstates. The RG evolution of various many-particle entanglement
features of the eigenbasis are, in turn, quantified through the coefficient tensor network. In
this way, we show that the URG framework provides a microscopic understanding of holographic renormalisation:
the RG flow of the vertex tensor network generates a eigenstate coefficient tensor network possessing
a many-particle entanglement metric. We find that the eigenstate tensor network accommodates
sign factors arising from fermion exchange.
