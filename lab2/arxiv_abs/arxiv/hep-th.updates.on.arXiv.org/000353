We study the stochastic distribution of spectator fields predicted in different slow-roll inflation
backgrounds. Spectator fields have a negligible energy density during inflation but may play an
important dynamical role later, even giving rise to primordial density perturbations within our
observational horizon today. During de-Sitter expansion there is an equilibrium solution for
the spectator field which is often used to estimate the stochastic distribution during slow-roll
inflation. However slow roll only requires that the Hubble rate varies slowly compared to the Hubble
time, while the time taken for the stochastic distribution to evolve to the de-Sitter equilibrium
solution can be much longer than a Hubble time. We study both chaotic (monomial) and plateau inflaton
potentials, with quadratic, quartic and axionic spectator fields. We give an adiabaticity condition
for the spectator field distribution to relax to the de-Sitter equilibrium, and find that the de-Sitter
approximation is never a reliable estimate for the typical distribution at the end of inflation
for a quadratic spectator during monomial inflation. The existence of an adiabatic regime at early
times can erase the dependence on initial conditions of the final distribution of field values.
In these cases, spectator fields acquire sub-Planckian expectation values. Otherwise spectator
fields may acquire much larger field displacements than suggested by the de-Sitter equilibrium
solution. We quantify the information about initial conditions that can be obtained from the final
field distribution. Our results may have important consequences for the viability of spectator
models for the origin of structure, such as the simplest curvaton models.
