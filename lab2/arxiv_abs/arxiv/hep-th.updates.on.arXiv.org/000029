Ever since E.Cartan in the 1920s enriched the geometric framework of general relativity (GR) by
introducing a {\it torsion} of spacetime, the question arose whether one could find a measurement
technique for detecting the presence of a torsion field. Mao et al.(2007) claimed that the rotating
quartz balls in the gyroscopes of the Gravity Probe B experiment, falling freely on an orbit around
the Earth, should "feel" the torsion. Similarly, March et al.(2011) argue with the precession of
the Moon and the Mercury and extend later their considerations to the Lageos satellite.--- A consistent
theory of gravity with torsion emerged during the early 1960's as gauge theory of the Poincar\'e
group. This Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity incorporates as simplest viable cases the Einstein-Cartan(-Sciama-Kibble)
theory (EC), the teleparallel equivalent GR|| of GR, and GR itself. So far, PG and, in particular,
the existence of torsion have {\it not} been experimentally confirmed. However, PG is to be considered
as the standard theory of gravity with torsion because of its very convincing gauge structure.---
Since the early 1970s up to today, different groups have shown more or less independently that torsion
couples only to the {\it elementary particle spin} and under no circumstances to the orbital angular
momentum of test particles. This is established knowledge and we reconfirm this conclusion by discussing
the energy-momentum law of PG, which has same form for all versions of PG. Therefore, we conclude
that, unfortunately, the investigations of Mao et al. and March et al. do not yield any information
on torsion.
