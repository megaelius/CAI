In frames of the nonlocal and nonpolynomial quantum theory of the one component scalar field in $D$-dimensional
spacetime, stated by Gariy Vladimirovich Efimov, the expansion of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is
studied for different interaction Lagrangians and for some kinds of Gaussian propagators modified
by different ultraviolet form factors which depend on some length parameter $l$. The expansion
of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is of the form of a grand canonical partition function of some $D+N$-dimensional
($N\geq 1$) classical gas with interaction. The toy model of the realistic quantum field theory
(QFT) is considered where the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix is calculated in closed form. Then, the functional
Schwinger-Dyson and Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix in Efimov representation
are derived. These equations play a central role in the present paper. The functional Schwinger--Dyson
and Schr\"{o}dinger equations in Efimov representation do not involve explicit functional derivatives
but involve a shift of the field which is the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix argument. The asymptotic solutions
of the Schwinger--Dyson equation are obtained in different limits. Also, the solution is found
in one heuristic case allowing us to study qualitatively the behavior of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix
for an arbitrary finite value of its argument. Self-consistency equations, which arise during
the process of derivation, are of a great interest. Finally, in the light of the discussion of QFT
functional equations, ultraviolet form factors and extra dimensions, the connection with functional
(in terms of the Wilson-Polchinski and Wetterich-Morris functional equations) and holographic
renormalization groups (in terms of the functional Hamilton-Jacobi equation) is made. In addition
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is formulated in an unconventional way.
