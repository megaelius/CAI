We apply dimer diagram techniques to uncover discrete global symmetries in the fields theories
on D3-branes at singularities given by general orbifolds of general toric Calabi-Yau threefold
singularities. The discrete symmetries are discrete Heisenberg groups, with two $\mathbf{Z}_N$
generators $A$, $B$ with commutation $AB=CBA$, with $C$ a central element. This fully generalizes
earlier observations in particular orbifolds of $\mathbf{C}^3$, the conifold and $Y_{p,q}$.
The solution for any orbifold of a given parent theory follows from a universal structure in the infinite
dimer in $\mathbf{R}^2$ giving the covering space of the unit cell of the parent theory before orbifolding.
The generator $A$ is realized as a shift in the dimer diagram, associated to the orbifold quantum
symmetry; the action of $B$ is determined by equations describing a 1-form in the dimer graph in the
unit cell of the parent theory with twisted boundary conditions; finally, $C$ is an element of the
(mesonic and baryonic) non-anomalous U$(1)$ symmetries, determined by geometric identities
involving the elements of the dimer graph of the parent theory. These discrete global symmetries
of the quiver gauge theories are holographically dual to discrete gauge symmetries from torsion
cycles in the horizon, as we also briefly discuss. Our findings allow to easily construct the discrete
symmetries for infinite classes of orbifolds. We provide explicit examples by constructing the
discrete symmetries for the infinite classes of general orbifolds of $\mathbf{C}^3$, conifold,
and complex cones over the toric del Pezzo surfaces, $dP_1$, $dP_2$ and $dP_3$.
