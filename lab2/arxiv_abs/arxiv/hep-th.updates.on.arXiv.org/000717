We continue the construction of a Lagrangian description of irreducible half-integer higher-spin
representations of the Poincare group with an arbitrary Young tableaux having $k$ rows, on a basis
of the BRST--BFV approach suggested for bosonic fields in our first article (Nucl. Phys. B862 (2012)
270, [arXiv:1110.5044[hep-th]). Starting from a description of fermionic mixed-symmetry higher-spin
fields in a flat space of any dimension in terms of an auxiliary Fock space associated with a special
Poincare module, we realize a conversion of the initial operator constraint system (constructed
with respect to the relations extracting irreducible Poincare-group representations) into a
system of first-class constraints. To do this, we find, in first time, by means of generalized Verma
module the auxiliary representations of the constraint subsuperalgebra, to be isomorphic due
to Howe duality to $osp(k|2k)$ superalgebra, and containing the subsystem of second-class constraints
in terms of new oscillator variables. We suggest a universal procedure of finding unconstrained
gauge-invariant Lagrangians with reducible gauge symmetries, describing the dynamics of both
massless and massive fermionic fields of any spin. It is shown that the space of BRST cohomologies
with a vanishing ghost number is determined only by constraints corresponding to an irreducible
Poincare-group representation. As examples of the general approach, we propose a method of Lagrangian
construction for fermionic fields subject to an arbitrary Young tableaux having 3 rows, and obtain
a gauge-invariant Lagrangian for a new model of a massless rank-3 spin-tensor field of spin (5/2,3/2)
with first-stage reducible gauge symmetries and a non-gauge Lagrangian for a massive rank-3 spin-tensor
field of spin (5/2,3/2).
