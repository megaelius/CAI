QCD is not supersymmetrical in the traditional sense -- the QCD Lagrangian is based on quark and gluonic
fields, not squarks nor gluinos. However, its hadronic eigensolutions conform to a representation
of superconformal algebra, reflecting the underlying conformal symmetry of chiral QCD and its
Pauli matrix representation. The eigensolutions of superconformal algebra provide a unified
Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and tetraquarks in the same 4-plet representation with a universal
Regge slope. The pion $q \bar q$ eigenstate has zero mass for $m_q=0.$ The superconformal relations
also can be extended to heavy-light quark mesons and baryons. The combined approach of light-front
holography and superconformal algebra also provides insight into the origin of the QCD mass scale
and color confinement. A key observation is the remarkable dAFF principle which shows how a mass
scale can appear in the Hamiltonian and the equations of motion while retaining the conformal symmetry
of the action. When one applies the dAFF procedure to chiral QCD, a mass scale $\kappa$ appears which
determines universal Regge slopes, hadron masses in the absence of the Higgs coupling, and the mass
parameter underlying the form of the nonperturbative QCD running coupling: $\alpha_s(Q^2) \propto
\exp{-{Q^2/4 \kappa^2}}$, in agreement with the effective charge determined from measurements
of the Bjorken sum rule. The mass scale $\kappa$ underlying hadron masses can be connected to the
parameter $\Lambda_{\overline {MS}}$ in the QCD running coupling by matching its predicted nonperturbative
form to the perturbative QCD regime. One also obtains predictions for spacelike and timelike hadronic
form factors, structure functions, distribution amplitudes, and transverse momentum distributions.
