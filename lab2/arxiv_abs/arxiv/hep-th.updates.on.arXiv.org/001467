For a pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 4D we revisit the spatial, ball-like region of radius $r_0$,
filled with pressureless deconfining phase of a finite energy density, which represents the self-intersection
of a figure-eight shaped center-vortex loop. The entire soliton (vortex loop plus region of self-intersection)
can be considered an excitation of the pressure- and energyless ground state of the confining phase.
Correcting an earlier estimate of $r_0$, we show that this self-intersection region originates
from the spatially coarse-grained {\sl central part} of a(n) (anti)caloron. A {\sl BPS monopole}
of core radius $\sim \frac{r_0}{8.3}$, isolated from its antimonopole by repulsion externally
invoked through a transient shift of (anti)caloron holonomy (pair creation), is trapped within
this region, contributes $\sim$7.5\,\% to the region's rest mass $m_0$, and carries one unit of
U(1) charge: this monopole indeterministically varies its position and core-vibrates at a frequency
$\omega_0$ via perturbations -- facilitated by Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ -- of its classical,
static and stable field configuration. The quantity $\hbar$ effectively acts within the region
of self-intersection by one unit of winding ($S_3=\partial {\bf R}^4\to S_3=\mbox{SU(2)}$) around
the 4D point of maximum action density prescribed by the fundamental (anti)caloronic SU(2) gauge
field. For a deconfining-phase plasma oscillation about a zero-pressure background we compute
the lowest frequency $\Omega_0$ within a {\sl neutral} and homogeneous spatial ball (no trapped
monopole) in dependence of its radius $R_0$. For $r_0=R_0$ a comparison of $\omega_0$ with $\Omega_0$
reveals that the neutral plasma oscillates much slower than the same plasma driven by the oscillation
of a monopole core.
