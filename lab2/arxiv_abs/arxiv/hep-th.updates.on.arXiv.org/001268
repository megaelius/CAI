Fractional calculus is a couple of centuries old, but its development has been less embraced and
it was only within the last century that a program of applications for physics started. Regarding
quantum physics, it has been only in the previous decade or so that the corresponding literature
resulted in a set of defying papers. In such a context, this manuscript constitutes a cordial invitation,
whose purpose is simply to suggest, mostly through a heuristic and unpretentious presentation,
the extension of fractional quantum mechanics to cosmological settings. Being more specific,
we start by outlining a historical summary of fractional calculus. Then, following this motivation,
a (very) brief appraisal of fractional quantum mechanics is presented, but where details (namely
those of a mathematical nature) are left for literature perusing. Subsequently, the application
of fractional calculus in quantum cosmology is introduced, advocating it as worthy to consider:
if the progress of fractional calculus serves as an argument, indeed useful consequences will also
be drawn (to cite from Leibnitz). In particular, we discuss different difficulties that may affect
the operational framework to employ, namely the issues of minisuperspace covariance and fractional
derivatives, for instance. An example of investigation is provided by means of a very simple model.
Concretely, we restrict ourselves to speculate that with minimal fractional calculus elements,
we may have a peculiar tool to inspect the flatness problem of standard cosmology. In summary, the
subject of fractional quantum cosmology is herewith proposed, merely realized in terms of an open
program constituted by several challenges.
