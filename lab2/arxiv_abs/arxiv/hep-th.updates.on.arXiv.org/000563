We present a new perspective on thermal and quantum phase transitions (QPT) in $(2+1)$-dimensional
quantum chromodynamics based on symmetries, topology, and quantum dynamical structure of the
baryon ground state in the 't Hooft large $N$ limit. The intermediate and high density regimes are
modeled through effective four-fermion interactions, which include attractive scalar and diquark
terms, with a term to account for vector meson repulsion at high densities. We construct the quantum
field theory for fluctuations in internal degrees of freedom of the baryon ground state. A key QPT
occurs at the meson-diquark quantum critical point (QCP), driven by the ratio of the baryon chemical
potential to the quark mass, $\mu_B/m$, or to an external applied magnetic field, $\mu_B/|eB|$.
We find $|\mu_B - {\mu_B}_c |^{1/2}$ scaling at the QCP for the scalar condensate, BCS gap and pseudogap,
among others. Remarkably, competition between $\mu_B$ and $m$ (or $B$), destroys superconductivity
via a \emph{quantum} Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition, at ${\mu_B}_c$.
Properties of the QCP depend on diverging quantum fluctuations of a continuous parameter $\gamma$
that modulates angular positions of baryon potential minima. These minima are identified with
elements of discrete chiral symmetries $\mathbb{Z}_2^\sigma$, $\mathbb{Z}_2^{LR} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{LR}$,
and $\mathbb{Z}_4^\chi$, which characterize the meson, diquark, and asymptotically free regimes.
Large $\gamma$ fluctuations at ${\mu_B }_c$ appear as an additional momentum scale, resulting
in an effective $(3+1)$d conformal critical theory there. We use our results to elucidate the nature
of \emph{holographic} BKT transitions, from the field theory side, a result which has remained
elusive to date. We derive the QCD phase diagram for $\mu_B$ above the baryon mass and find good agreement
with results obtained by other methods.
