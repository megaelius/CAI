We propose a new measure for eternal inflation, based on search optimization and first-passage
statistics. The approach is motivated by the possibility that eternal inflation has been unfolding
for a finite time much shorter than the exponentially long mixing time for the landscape. The proposed
accessibility measure assigns greater weight to vacua that are accessed efficiently under time
evolution. It is the analogue of the closeness centrality index widely used in network science.
The proposed measure enjoys a number of desirable properties. It is simultaneously time-reparametrization
invariant, independent of initial conditions, and oblivious to physical vs comoving weighing
of pocket universes. Importantly, the proposed measure makes concrete and testable predictions
that are largely independent of anthropic reasoning. Firstly, it favors vacua residing in regions
of the landscape with funnel-like topography, akin to the energy landscape of naturally-occurring
proteins. Secondly, it favors regions of the landscape that are tuned at dynamical criticality,
with vacua having an average lifetime of order the de Sitter Page time. Thus the predicted lifetime
of our universe is of order its Page time, $\sim 10^{130}$ years, which is compatible with Standard
Model estimates for electroweak metastability. Relatedly, the supersymmetry breaking scale
should be high, at least $10^{10}$ GeV. The discovery of beyond-the-Standard Model particles at
the Large Hadron Collider or future accelerators, including low-scale supersymmetry, would rule
out the possibility that our vacuum lies in an optimal region of the landscape. The present framework
suggests a correspondence between the near-criticality of our universe and dynamical critical
phenomena on the string landscape.
