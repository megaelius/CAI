We elaborate on the recent proposal that intersection numbers of certain cohomology classes on
the moduli space of genus-zero Riemann surfaces with punctures compute tree-level scattering
amplitudes in quantum field theories. The relevant cohomology classes are twisted by representations
of the fundamental group that describes how punctures braid around each other on the Riemann surface,
which can be used to link it to the space of kinematic invariants. Intersection numbers of said cohomology
classes, whose representatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the boundaries
of the moduli space, which are in one-to-one map with Feynman diagrams. We prove that when twisted
forms are logarithmic, their intersection numbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent
Feynman diagrams allowing only for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For
physical applications one also needs to study non-logarithmic forms as they are responsible for
propagation of massive states. We utilize the natural fibre bundle structure of the moduli space,
which allows for a direct access to the boundaries, to introduce recursion relations for intersection
numbers that "integrate out" puncture-by-puncture. The resulting recursion involves only linear
algebra of certain matrices describing braiding properties of the moduli space and evaluating
one-dimensional residues, thus paving a way for explicit analytic computations of scattering
amplitudes. Together with the previous reformulation of the tree-level S-matrix of string theory
in terms of twisted forms, the results of this work complete a unified geometric framework for studying
scattering amplitudes from genus-zero Riemann surfaces. We show that a web of dualities between
different homology and cohomology groups allows for deriving a host of identities among various
types of amplitudes computed from the moduli space.
