We test various conjectures about quantum gravity for six-dimensional string compactifications
in the framework of F-theory. Starting with a gauge theory coupled to gravity, we analyze the limit
in K\"ahler moduli space where the gauge coupling tends to zero while gravity is kept dynamical.
We show that such a limit must be located at infinite distance in the moduli space. As expected, the
low-energy effective theory breaks down in this limit due to a tower of charged particles becoming
massless. These are the excitations of an asymptotically tensionless string, which is shown to
coincide with a critical heterotic string compactified to six dimensions. For a more quantitative
analysis, we focus on a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and use a chain of dualities and mirror symmetry to determine
the elliptic genus of the nearly tensionless string, which is given in terms of certain meromorphic
weak Jacobi forms. Their modular properties in turn allow us to determine the mass-to-charge ratios
of certain string excitations near the tensionless limit. We then provide evidence that the tower
of asymptotically massless charged states satisfies the (sub-)Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture,
the Completeness Conjecture, and the Swampland Distance Conjecture. Quite remarkably, we find
that the number theoretic properties of the elliptic genus conspire with the balance of gravitational
and scalar forces of extremal black holes, such as to produce a narrowly tuned charge spectrum of
superextremal states. As a byproduct, we show how to compute elliptic genera of both critical and
non-critical strings, when refined by Mordell-Weil $U(1)$ symmetries in F-theory.
