We review a class of models which generalize the traditional Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion solution by
a St\"uckelberg pseudoscalar. Such axion models represent a significant variant with respect
to earlier scenarios where axion fields were associated with global anomalies, because of the St\"uckelberg
field, which is essential for the cancellation of gauge anomalies in the presence of extra $U(1)$
symmetries. The extra neutral currents associated to these models have been investigated in the
past in orientifold models with intersecting branes, under the assumption that the St\"uckelberg
scale was in the multi-TeV region. Such constructions, at the field theory level, are quite general
and can be interpreted as the four-dimensional field theory realization of the Green-Schwarz mechanism
of anomaly cancellation of string theory. We present an overview of models of this type in the TeV/multi
TeV range in their original formulation and their recent embeddings into an ordinary GUT theory,
presenting an $E_6\times U(1)_X$ model as an example. In this case the model contains two axions,
the first corresponding to a Peccei-Quinn axion, whose misalignment takes place at the QCD phase
transition, with a mass in the meV region and which solves the strong CP problem. The second axion
is ultralight, in the $10^{-20}-10^{-22}$ eV region, due to a misalignment and a decoupling taking
place at the GUT scale. The two scales introduced by the PQ solution, the PQ breaking scale and the
misalignment scale at the QCD hadron transition, become the Planck and the GUT scales respectively,
with a global anomaly replaced by a gauge anomaly. The periodic potential and the corresponding
oscillations are related to a particle whose De Broglie wavelength can reach 10 kpc. Such a sub-galactic
scale has been deemed necessary in order to resolve several dark matter issues at the astrophysical
level.
