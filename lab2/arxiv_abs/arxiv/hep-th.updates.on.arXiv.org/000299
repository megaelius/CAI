In recent work, we introduced Picard-Lefschetz theory as a tool for defining the Lorentzian path
integral for quantum gravity in a systematic semiclassical expansion. This formulation avoids
several pitfalls occurring in the Euclidean approach. Our method provides, in particular, a more
precise formulation of the Hartle-Hawking no boundary proposal, as a sum over real Lorentzian four-geometries
interpolating between an initial three-geometry of zero size, {\it i.e}, a point, and a final three-geometry.
With this definition, we calculated the no boundary amplitude for a closed universe with a cosmological
constant, assuming cosmological symmetry for the background and including linear perturbations.
We found the opposite semiclassical exponent to that obtained by Hartle and Hawking for the creation
of a de Sitter spacetime "from nothing". Furthermore, we found the linearized perturbations to
be governed by an {\it inverse} Gaussian distribution, meaning they are unsuppressed and out of
control. Recently, Diaz Dorronsoro {\it et al.} followed our methods but attempted to rescue the
no boundary proposal by integrating the lapse over a different, intrinsically complex contour.
Here, we show that, in addition to the desired Hartle-Hawking saddle point contribution, their
contour yields extra, non-perturbative corrections which again render the perturbations unsuppressed.
We prove there is {\it no} choice of complex contour for the lapse which avoids this problem. We extend
our discussion to include backreaction in the leading semiclassical approximation, fully nonlinearly
for the lowest tensor harmonic and to second order for all higher modes. Implications for quantum
de Sitter spacetime and for cosmic inflation are briefly discussed.
