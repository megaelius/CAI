Higher gauge theories play a prominent role in the construction of 4d topological invariants and
have been long ago proposed as a tool for 4d quantum gravity. The Yetter lattice model and its continuum
counterpart, the BFCG theory, generalize BF theory to 2-gauge groups and -- when specialized to
4d and the Poincar\'e 2-group -- they provide an exactly solvable topologically-flat version of
4d general relativity. The 2-Poincar\'e Yetter model was conjectured to be equivalent to a state
sum model of quantum flat spacetime developed by Baratin and Freidel after work by Korepanov (KBF
model). This conjecture was motivated by the origin of the KBF model in the theory of 2-representations
of the Poincar\'e 2-group. Its proof, however, has remained elusive due to the lack of a generalized
Peter-Weyl theorem for 2-groups. In this work we prove this conjecture. Our proof avoids the Peter-Weyl
theorem and rather leverages the geometrical content of the Yetter model. Key for the proof is the
introduction of a kinematical boundary Hilbert space on which 1- and 2-Lorentz invariance is imposed.
Geometrically this allows the identification of (quantum) tetrad variables and of the associated
(quantum) Levi-Civita connection. States in this Hilbert space are labelled by quantum numbers
that match the 2-group representation labels. Our results open exciting opportunities for the
construction of new representations of quantum geometries. Compared to loop quantum gravity,
the higher gauge theory framework provides a quantum representation of the ADM-Regge initial data,
including an identification of the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature. Furthermore, it leads to
a version of the diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints that acts on the vertices of the discretization,
thus providing a prospect for a quantum realization of the hypersurface deformation algebra in
4d.
