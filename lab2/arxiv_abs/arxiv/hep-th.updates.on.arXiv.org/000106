We consider a scalar thick brane configuration arising in a 5D theory of gravity coupled to a self-interacting
scalar field in a Riemannian manifold. We start from known classical solutions of the corresponding
field equations and elaborate on the physics of the transverse traceless modes of linear fluctuations
of the classical background, which obey a Schroedinger-like equation. We further consider two
special cases in which this equation can be solved analytically for any massive mode with m^2>0,
in contrast with numerical approaches, allowing us to study in closed form the massive spectrum
of Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations and to compute the corrections to Newton's law in the thin brane
limit. In the first case we consider a solution with a mass gap in the spectrum of KK fluctuations with
two bound states - the massless 4D graviton free of tachyonic instabilities and a massive KK excitation
- as well as a tower of continuous massive KK modes which obey a Legendre equation. The mass gap is defined
by the inverse of the brane thickness, allowing us to get rid of the potentially dangerous multiplicity
of arbitrarily light KK modes. It is shown that due to this lucky circumstance, the solution of the
mass hierarchy problem is much simpler and transparent than in the (thin) Randall-Sundrum (RS)
two-brane configuration. In the second case we present a smooth version of the RS model with a single
massless bound state, which accounts for the 4D graviton, and a sector of continuous fluctuation
modes with no mass gap, which obey a confluent Heun equation in the Ince limit. (The latter seems to
have physical applications for the first time within braneworld models). For this solution the
mass hierarchy problem is solved as in the Lykken-Randall model and the model is completely free
of naked singularities.
