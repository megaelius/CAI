In the tetrad formulation of gravity, the so-called simplicity constraints play a central role.
They appear in the Hamiltonian analysis of the theory, and in the Lagrangian path integral when constructing
the gravity partition function from topological BF theory. We develop here a systematic analysis
of the corner symplectic structure encoding the symmetry algebra of gravity, and perform a thorough
analysis of the simplicity constraints. Starting from a precursor phase space with Poincar\'e
and Heisenberg symmetry, we obtain the corner phase space of BF theory by imposing kinematical constraints.
This amounts to fixing the Heisenberg frame with a choice of position and spin operators. The simplicity
constraints then further reduce the Poincar\'e symmetry of the BF phase space to a Lorentz subalgebra.
This picture provides a particle-like description of (quantum) geometry: The internal normal
plays the role of the four-momentum, the Barbero-Immirzi parameter that of the mass, the flux that
of a relativistic position, and the frame that of a spin harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we show that
the corner area element corresponds to the Poincar\'e spin Casimir. We achieve this central result
by properly splitting, in the continuum, the corner simplicity constraints into first and second
class parts. We construct the complete set of Dirac observables, which includes the generators
of the local $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ subalgebra of Poincar\'e, and the components of the
tangential corner metric satisfying an $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. We then present
a preliminary analysis of the covariant and continuous irreducible representations of the infinite-dimensional
corner algebra. Moreover, as an alternative path to quantization, we also introduce a regularization
of the corner algebra and interpret this discrete setting in terms of an extended notion of twisted
geometries.
