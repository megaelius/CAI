A brief review of effective SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics in the deconfining phase is given,
including the construction of the thermal ground-state estimate in terms of an inert, adjoint scalar
field $\phi$, based on non-propagating (anti)selfdual field configurations of topological charge
unity. We explain why the screening physics of an SU(2) photon is subject to an electric-magnetically
dual interpretation. Next, we elucidate how a low-frequency excess of line temperature in the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) determines the value of the critical temperature of the deconfining-preconfining
phase transition of an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory postulated to describe photon propagation, and
we describe how, starting at a redshift of about unity, SU(2) photons collectively work 3D temperature
depressions into the CMB. Upon projection along a line of sight, a given depression influences the
present CMB sky in a cosmologically local way, possibly explaining the large-angle anomalies confirmed
recently by the Planck collaboration. Finally, six relativistic polarisations residing in the
SU(2) vector modes roughly match the number of degrees of freedom in cosmic neutrinos (Planck) which
would disqualify the latter as radiation. Indeed, if interpreted as single center-vortex loops
in confining phases of SU(2) Yang-Mills theories neutrino mass $m_\nu$ solely arises by interactions
with an environment. Cosmologically, the CMB represents this environment, and thus one would expect
that $m_\nu=\xi T$ where $\xi=O(1)$. In this model cosmic neutrinos are a small dark-matter contribution,
conserved only together with the CMB fluid, influencing Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations during
CMB decoupling.
