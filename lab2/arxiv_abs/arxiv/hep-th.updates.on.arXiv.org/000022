In this work we study a Horava-like five-dimensional model in the context of braneworld theory.
To begin with, the equations of motion of such model are obtained and, within the realm of warped geometry,
we show that the model is consistent if and only if $\lambda$ takes its relativistic value 1. Furthermore,
since the first derivative of the warp factor is discontinuous over the branes, we show that the elimination
of problematic terms involving the square of the warp factor second order derivatives are eliminated
by imposing detailed balance condition in the bulk. Afterwards, the Israel's junction conditions
are computed, allowing the attainment of an effective Lagrangian in the visible brane. In particular,
for a (4+1)-dimensional Horava-like model defined in the bulk without cosmological constant,
we show that the resultant effective Lagrangian in the brane corresponds to a (3+1)-dimensional
Horava-like model with an emergent positive cosmological constant but without detailed balance
condition. Now, restoration of detailed balance condition, at this time imposed over the brane,
plays an interesting role by fitting accordingly the sign of the arbitrary constant $\beta$ that
labels the extra terms in the model, insuring a positive brane tension and a real energy for the graviton
within its dispersion relation. To end up with, the brane consistency equations are obtained and,
as a result, we show that the detailed balance condition again plays an essential role in eliminating
bad behaving terms and that the model admits positive brane tensions in the compactification scheme
if, and only if, $\beta$ is negative, what is in accordance with the previous result obtained for
the visible brane.
