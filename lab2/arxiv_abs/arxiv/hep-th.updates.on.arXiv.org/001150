We consider the entanglement entropies in dS$_d$ sliced (A)dS$_{d+1}$ in the presence of a hard
radial cutoff for $2\le d\le 6$. By considering a one parameter family of analytical solutions,
parametrized by their turning point in the bulk $r^\star$, we are able to compute the entanglement
entropy for generic intervals on the cutoff slice. It has been proposed that the field theory dual
of this scenario is a strongly coupled CFT, deformed by a certain irrelevant deformation -- the so-called
$T\bar T$ deformation. Surprisingly, we find that we may write the entanglement entropies formally
in the same way as the entanglement entropy for antipodal points on the sphere by introducing an effective
radius $R_\text{eff}=R\,\cos(\beta_\epsilon)$, where $R$ is the radius of the sphere and $\beta_\epsilon$
related to the length of the interval. Geometrically, this is equivalent to following the $T\bar
T$ trajectory until the generic interval corresponds to antipodal points on the sphere. Finally,
we check our results by comparing the asymptotic behavior (no Dirichlet wall present) with the results
of Casini, Huerta and Myers. We then switch on counterterms on the cutoff slice which are important
with regards to the field theory calculation. We explicitly compute the contributions of the counterterms
to the entanglement entropy by considering the Wald entropy. In the second part of this work, we extend
the field theory calculation of the entanglement entropy for antipodal points for a $d$-dimensional
field theory in context of DS/dS holography. We find excellent agreement with the results from holography
and show, in particular, that the effects of the counterterms in the field theory calculation match
the Wald entropy associated with the counterterms on the gravity side.
