We construct an effective Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theories with $n$ extra dimensions. We start
from a field theory governed by the extra-dimensional Poincar\'e group ISO$(1,3+n)$ and by the
extended gauge group $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4+n})$, characterized by an unknown energy scale $\Lambda$
and assumed to be valid at energies far below this scale. Assuming that the size of the extra dimensions
is much larger than the distance scale at which this theory is valid, we construct an effective theory
with symmetry groups ISO$(1,3)$, $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4})$. Such theories are connected by a canonical
transformation that hides the extended symmetries ISO$(1,3+n)$, $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4+n})$ into
the standard ISO(1,3), $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4})$, thus generating KK gauge masses. Using a set of orthogonal
functions $\{f^{(\underline{0})},f^{(\underline{m})}(\bar x)\}$, defined by the Casimir
invariant $\bar{P}^2$ of the translations subgroup $T(n)\subset$ISO$(n)$, we expand the degrees
of freedom of ISO(1,3+n), $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4+n})$ in general Fourier series, whose coefficients
are the degrees of freedom of ISO(1,3), $SU(N,{\cal M}^{4})$. These functions, which correspond
to the projection on the basis $\{|\bar{x} \big >\}$ of the discrete basis $\{|0\big >,|p^{(\underline{m})}\big
>\}$ generated by $\bar {P}^2$, are central to define the effective theory. Components along the
ground state $f^{(\underline{0})}=\big <\bar x|0\big>$ do not receive mass at the compactification
scale, so they are identified with the standard Yang-Mills fields; components along excited states
$f^{(\underline{m})}=\big<\bar x|p^{(\underline{m})}\big>$ receive mass at this scale, so
they correspond to KK excitations. Associated with any direction $|p^{(\underline{m})}\neq0\big>$
there are a massive gauge field and a pseudo-Goldstone boson. We stress resemblances of this mass-generating
mechanism with the Englert-Higgs mechanism.
