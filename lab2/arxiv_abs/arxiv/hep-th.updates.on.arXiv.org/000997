We establish the universal torus low-energy spectra at the free Dirac fixed point and at the strongly
coupled {\em chiral Ising} fixed point and their subtle crossover behaviour in the Gross-Neuveu-Yukawa
field theory with ${n_\text{D}=4}$ component Dirac spinors in $D=(2+1)$ dimensions. These fixed
points and the field theories are directly relevant for the long-wavelength physics of certain
interacting Dirac systems, such as repulsive spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice or $\pi$-flux
square lattice. The torus spectrum has been shown previously to serve as a characteristic fingerprint
of relativistic fixed points and is a powerful tool to discriminate quantum critical behaviour
in numerical simulations. Here we use a combination of exact diagonalization and quantum Monte
Carlo simulations of strongly interacting fermionic lattice models, to compute the critical energy
spectrum on finite-size clusters with periodic boundaries and extrapolate them to the thermodynamic
limit. Additionally, we compute the torus spectrum analytically using the perturbative expansion
in ${\epsilon = 4 - D}$, which is in good agreement with the numerical results, thereby validating
the presence of the chiral Ising fixed point in the lattice models at hand. We show that the strong
interaction between the spinor field and the scalar order-parameter field strongly influences
the critical torus spectrum. Building on these results we are able to address the subtle crossover
physics of the low-energy spectrum flowing from the chiral Ising fixed point to the Dirac fixed point,
and analyze earlier flawed attempts to extract Fermi velocity renormalizations from the low-energy
spectrum.
