A certain identification of points in a planar Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter (AdS) black hole generates
a four-dimensional static black string. In turn, a rotating black string can be obtained from a static
one by means of an `illegitimate coordinate transformation', a local boost in the compact direction.
On the basis of the gauge/gravity duality, these black strings are dual to rotating thermal states
of a strongly interacting conformal field theory (CFT) that lives on a cylinder. In this work, we
obtain the complete quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the gravitational perturbations of rotating
black strings. Analytic solutions for the dispersion relations are found in the hydrodynamic limit,
characterized by fluctuations with wavenumber and frequency much smaller than the Hawking temperature
of the string (or the temperature in the CFT dual description). We obtain these dispersion relations
both by studying the gravitational perturbations of rotating black strings and by investigating
the hydrodynamic fluctuations of a moving fluid living on the boundary of the AdS spacetime. Relativistic
effects like the Doppler shift of the frequencies, wavelength contraction, and dilation of the
thermalization time are shown explicitly in such a regime. We also investigate the behavior of a
sound wave propagating in a viscous fluid for several values of the rotation parameter. The numerical
solutions for the fundamental QNMs show a crossover (a transition) from a hydrodynamic-like behavior
to a linear relativistic scaling for large wavenumbers. Additionally, we find a new family of QNMs
which are purely damped in the zero wavenumber limit and that does not follow as a continuation of
QNMs of the static black string, but that appears to be closely related to the algebraically special
perturbation modes.
