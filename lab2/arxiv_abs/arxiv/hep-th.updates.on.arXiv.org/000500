We review nonsingular static, spherically symmetric solutions of general relativity with a minimally
coupled scalar field $\phi$ as a source. Considered are wormholes and regular black holes without
a center, including black universes (black holes with an expanding cosmology beyond the horizon).
Such configurations require a "ghost" field with negative kinetic energy, but it may be negative
in a restricted (strong-field) region of space and positive outside it ("trapped ghost") thus explaining
why no ghosts are observed under usual conditions. Another possible explanation of the same may
be a rapid decay of a ghost field at large radii. Before discussing particular examples, some general
results are presented, such as the necessity of anisotropic matter for obtaining asymptotically
flat or anti-de Sitter wormholes, no-hair and global structure theorems for black holes with scalar
fields. The stability properties of scalar wormholes and regular black holes are discussed for
perturbations preserving spherical symmetry. It is stressed that the effective potential $V_{eff}$
for perturbations has universal shapes near generic wormhole throats (a positive pole regularizable
by a Darboux transformation) and near transition surfaces from canonical to ghost behavior of the
scalar field (a negative pole at which the perturbation finiteness requirement plays a stabilizing
role). It is also found that positive poles of $V_{eff}$ emerging at "long throats" (with the spherical
radius $r \approx r_0 + {\rm const} \cdot x^{2n}$, $n > 1$, if $x=0$ is the throat) may be regularized
by repeated Darboux transformations for some values of $n$.
