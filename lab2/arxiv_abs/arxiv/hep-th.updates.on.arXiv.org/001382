Recently it has been found that quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram possesses a duality
between chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation. For the first time this was revealed in
the QCD motivated toy model. Then it was demonstrated in effective models as well and new additional
dualities being found. We briefly recap the main features of this story and then discuss its applications
as a tool to explore the QCD phase structure. The most appealing application is the possibility of
getting the results on the QCD phase diagram at large baryon density. Taking the idea from large $1/N_{c}$
universalities it was argued that the scenario of circumventing the sign problem with the help of
dualities seems plausible. It is also discussed that there is a persistent problem about whether
there should be catalysis or anti-catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking by chiral imbalance. One
can probably say that the issue is settled after lattice results (first principle approach), where
the catalysis was observed. But they used an unphysically large pion mass so it is still interesting
to get additional indications that this is the case. It is shown just by the duality property that
there exists catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking. So, having in mind our results and the earlier
lattice simulations, one can probably claim that this issue is settled. It is demonstrated that
the duality can be used to obtain new results. As an example, it is showcased how the phase structure
of dense quark matter with chiral imbalance (with possibility of inhomogeneous phases) can be obtained
from the knowledge of a QCD phase diagram with isopin asymmetry.
