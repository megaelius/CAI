A new mechanism for generating particle number asymmetry (PNA) has been developed. This mechanism
is realized with a Lagrangian including a complex scalar field and a neutral scalar field. The complex
scalar carries U(1) charge which is associated with the PNA. It is written in terms of the condensation
and Green's function, which is obtained with two-particle irreducible (2PI) closed time path (CTP)
effective action (EA). In the spatially flat universe with a time-dependent scale factor, the time
evolution of the PNA is computed. We start with an initial condition where only the condensation
of the neutral scalar is non-zero. The initial condition for the fields is specified by a density
operator parameterized by the temperature of the universe. With the above initial conditions,
the PNA vanishes at the initial time and later it is generated through the interaction between the
complex scalar and the condensation of the neutral scalar. We investigate the case that both the
interaction and the expansion rate of the universe are small and include their effects up to the first
order of the perturbation. The expanding universe causes the effects of the dilution of the PNA,
freezing interaction and the redshift of the particle energy. As for the time dependence of the PNA,
we found that PNA oscillates at the early time and it begins to dump at the later time. The period and
the amplitude of the oscillation depend on the mass spectrum of the model, the temperature and the
expansion rate of the universe. We discuss the implications of the oscillating behavior of the PNA
on scenarios for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU).
