At the linear level, the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum predicted by inflation, and many of its
alternatives, can have arbitrarily small amplitude and consequently an unconstrained tilt. However,
at second order, tensor fluctuations are sourced by scalar fluctuations that have been measured
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These second order fluctuations generically produce
a minimum amount of tensor perturbations corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\sim 10^{-6}$.
Inverting this relationship yields a bound on the tensor tilt sourced by scalar fluctuations. Since
this induced GW spectrum depends on the scalar spectrum, we derive a new indirect bound that involves
\textit{all scales} of the scalar spectrum based on CMB observations. This bound comes from the
constraint on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, $N_{eff}$. We estimate
the bound using current data, and the improvements expected by future CMB experiment. The bound
forces the running and running of running to conform to standard slow-roll predictions of $\alpha,\beta
\lesssim (n_s-1)^2$, improving on current CMB measurements by an order of magnitude. This bound
has further implications for the possibility of primordial black holes as dark matter candidates.
Performing a likelihood analysis including this new constraint, we find that positive $\alpha$
and/or $\beta$ are disfavored at least at $1\sigma$. Finally, using bounds on the fractional energy
density of gravitational waves today obtained by LIGO and the Pulsar Timing Array, we obtain a bound
on the primordial scalar spectrum on these scales and give forecast for future measurements.
