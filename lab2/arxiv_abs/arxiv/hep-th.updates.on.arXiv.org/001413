In this letter we shall demonstrate that the viable $F(R)$ gravities can be classified mainly into
two classes of inflationary attractors, either the $R^2$ attractors or the $\alpha$-attractors.
To show this, we shall derive the most general relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and
the spectral index of primordial curvature perturbations $n_s$, namely the $r-n_s$ relation,
by assuming that the slow-roll condition constrains the values of the slow-roll indices. As we show,
the relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index of the primordial curvature
perturbations has the form $r\simeq \frac{48 (1-n_s)^2}{(4-x)^2}$, where the dimensionless
parameter $x$ contains higher derivatives of the $F(R)$ gravity function with respect to the Ricci
scalar, and it is a function of the $e$-foldings number $N$ and may also be a function of the free parameters
of the various $F(R)$ gravity models. For $F(R)$ gravities which have a spectral index compatible
with the observational data and also yield $x\ll 1$, these belong to the $R^2$-type of attractors,
with $r\sim 3 (1-n_s)^2$, and these are viable theories. Moreover, in the case that $x$ takes larger
values in specific ranges and is constant for a given $F(R)$ gravity, the resulting $r-n_s$ relation
has the form $r\sim 3 \alpha (1-n_s)^2$, where $\alpha$ is a constant. Thus we conclude that the viable
$F(R)$ gravities may be classified into two limiting types of $r-n_s$ relations, one identical
to the $R^2$ model at leading order in $x$, and one similar to the $\alpha$-attractors $r-n_s$ relation,
for the $F(R)$ gravity models that yield $x$ constant. Finally, we also discuss the case that $x$
is not constant.
