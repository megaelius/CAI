We consider QCD corrections to two loops for the polarized amplitudes of $q{\bar q}\to Z +$ Higgs
boson. First we show how the polarized amplitudes of $b \bar{b} \rightarrow Z h$ associated with
a non-vanishing $b$-quark Yukawa coupling and a scalar or pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h$ can be built
up solely from vector form factors (FF) of properly grouped classes of diagrams, bypassing completely
the need of explicitly manipulating $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularization (up to a few "anomalous",
i.e., triangle diagrams). We determine the contributions of the triangle diagrams in the heavy
top limit. We present the analytic results of the vector FF and the triangle-diagram contributions
to the axial vector FF, which are sufficient for deriving the two-loop QCD amplitudes for $b \bar{b}
\rightarrow Z h$ with a CP-even and CP-odd Higgs boson $h$. We derive the respective Ward identity
for these amplitudes, which are subsequently verified to two-loop order in QCD using these FF. In
addition, the FF of a class of corrections to $q \bar{q} \rightarrow ZH$ proportional to the top-Yukawa
coupling are obtained analytically to two-loop order in QCD in the heavy-top limit using the Higgs-gluon
effective Lagrangian where the top quark is integrated out. We address a pitfall that occurs when
applying the non-anticommutating $\gamma_5$ prescription to this class of contributions that
has been overlooked so far in the literature. We attribute this issue to the fact that the absence
of certain heavy-mass expanded diagrams in the infinite-mass limit of a scattering amplitude with
an axial vector current depends on the particular $\gamma_5$ prescription in use.
