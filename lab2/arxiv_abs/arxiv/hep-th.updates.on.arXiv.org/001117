We derive the nilpotent (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations for the system
of a toy model of Hodge theory (i.e. a rigid rotor) by exploiting the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST
invariant restrictions on the (anti-)chiral supervariables that are defined on the appropriately
chosen (1, 1)-dimensional super-submanifolds of the {\it general} (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold
on which our system of a one (0 + 1)-dimensional (1D) toy model of Hodge theory is considered within
the framework of the augmented version of the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach (ACSA) to Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin
(BRST) formalism. The general (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold is parameterized by the superspace
coordinates ($t, \theta, \bar\theta$) where $t$ is the bosonic evolution parameter and ($\theta,
\bar\theta$) are the Grassmannian variables which obey the standard fermionic relationships:
$ {\theta}^2 = {\bar\theta}^2 = 0, {\theta}\,{\bar\theta} + {\bar\theta}\,{\theta} = 0 $. We provide
the geometrical interpretations for the symmetry invariance and nilpotency property. Furthermore,
in our present endeavor, we establish the property of absolute anticommutativity of the conserved
fermionic charges which is a completely {\it novel} and surprising observation in our present endeavor
where we have considered {\it only} the (anti-)chiral supervariables. To corroborate the {\it
novelty} of the above observation, we apply this ACSA to an ${\cal N} = 2$ SUSY quantum mechanical
(QM) system of a free particle and show that the ${\cal N} = 2$ SUSY conserved and nilpotent charges
do {\it not} absolutely anticommute.
