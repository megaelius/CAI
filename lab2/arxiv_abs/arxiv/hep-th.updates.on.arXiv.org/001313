We further advance the study of the notion of computational complexity for 2d CFTs based on a gate
set built out of conformal symmetry transformations. Previously, it was shown that by choosing
a suitable cost function, the resulting complexity functional is equivalent to geometric (group)
actions on coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group, up to a term that originates from the central extension.
We show that this term can be recovered by modifying the cost function, making the equivalence exact.
Moreover, we generalize our approach to Kac-Moody symmetry groups, finding again an exact equivalence
between complexity functionals and geometric actions. We then determine the optimal circuits
for these complexity measures and calculate the corresponding costs for several examples of optimal
transformations. In the Virasoro case, we find that for all choices of reference state except for
the vacuum state, the complexity only measures the cost associated to phase changes, while assigning
zero cost to the non-phase changing part of the transformation. For Kac-Moody groups in contrast,
there do exist non-trivial optimal transformations beyond phase changes that contribute to the
complexity, yielding a finite gauge invariant result. Furthermore, we also show that the alternative
complexity proposal of path integral optimization is equivalent to the Virasoro proposal studied
here. Finally, we sketch a new proposal for a complexity definition for the Virasoro group that measures
the cost associated to non-trivial transformations beyond phase changes. This proposal is based
on a cost function given by a metric on the Lie group of conformal transformations. The minimization
of the corresponding complexity functional is achieved using the Euler-Arnold method yielding
the Korteweg-de Vries equation as equation of motion.
