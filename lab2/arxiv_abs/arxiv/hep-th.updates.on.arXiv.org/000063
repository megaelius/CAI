We calculate the bispectrum of primordial curvature perturbations, \zeta, generated during "open
inflation." Inflation occurs inside a bubble nucleated via quantum tunneling from the background
false vacuum state. Our universe lives inside the bubble, which can be described as a Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) universe with negative spatial curvature, undergoing slow-roll inflation. We pay special
attention to the issue of an initial state for quantum fluctuations. A "vacuum state" defined by
a positive-frequency mode in de Sitter space charted by open coordinates is different from the Euclidean
vacuum (which is equivalent to the so-called "Bunch-Davies vacuum"). Quantum tunneling then modifies
the initial state away from the original Euclidean vacuum. While most of the previous study on modifications
of the initial quantum state introduces, by hand, an initial time at which the quantum state is modified
as well as the form of the modification, an effective initial time naturally emerges and the form
is fixed by quantum tunneling in open inflation models. Therefore, open inflation enables a self-consistent
computation of the effect of a modified initial state on the bispectrum. We find a term which goes
as <\zeta_{k_1} \zeta_{k_2} \zeta_{k_3}> \propto 1/k_1^2k_3^4 in the so-called squeezed
configurations, k_3\ll k_1\approx k_2, in agreement with the previous study. The bispectrum in
the exact folded limit, e.g., k_1=k_2+k_3, is also enhanced and remains finite. However, these
terms are exponentially suppressed when the wavelength of \zeta is smaller than the curvature radius
of the universe. The leading-order bispectrum is equal to the usual one from single-field slow-roll
inflation; the terms specific for open inflation arise only in the sub-leading order when the wavelength
of \zeta is smaller than the curvature radius.
