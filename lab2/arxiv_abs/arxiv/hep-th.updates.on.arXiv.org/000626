In this paper, we aim to examine the relationship between the unstable circular photon orbit and
thermodynamic phase transition for a rotating Kerr-AdS black hole. On one side, we give a brief review
of the phase transition for the Kerr-AdS black hole. The coexistence curve and the metastable curve
corresponding to the phase transition are clearly shown. On the other side, we calculate the radius
and the angular momentum of the unstable circular orbits for photon by analyzing the effective potential.
Then combining these two sides, we find the follow results: i) The radius and the angular momentum
of the unstable circular photon orbits demonstrate the non-monotonic behaviors when the thermodynamic
phase transition takes place. So from the behavior of the circular orbit, one can determine whether
there exists a thermodynamic phase transition; ii) The difference of the radius or the angular momentum
for the coexistence small and large black holes can be treated as an order parameter to describe the
phase transition. And near the critical point, it has a critical exponent of $\frac{1}{2}$; iii)
Temperature and pressure corresponding to the extremal points of the radius or the angular momentum
of the unstable circular photon orbit completely agree with that of the metastable curves from the
thermodynamic side. Thus these results confirm the relationship between the geodesics and thermodynamic
phase transition for the Kerr-AdS black hole. Therefore, on one hand, we are allowed to probe the
thermodynamic phase transition from the gravity side. On the other hand, the signature of the strong
gravitational effect can also be revealed from the black hole thermodynamics.
