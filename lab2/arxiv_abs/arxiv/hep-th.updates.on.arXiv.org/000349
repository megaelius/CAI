We study Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data using the energy density
inhomogeneity power spectrum generated by quantum fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation
in the non-flat XCDM model. Here dark energy is parameterized using a fluid with a negative equation
of state parameter but with the speed of fluid acoustic inhomogeneities set to the speed of light.
We use this simple parameterization of dynamical dark energy, that is relatively straightforward
to use in a computation, in a first attempt to gain some insight into how dark energy dynamics and non-zero
spatial curvature jointly affect the CMB anisotropy data constraints. Unlike earlier analyses
of non-flat models, we use a physically consistent power spectrum for energy density inhomogeneities.
We find that the Planck 2015 data in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements
are reasonably well fit by a closed XCDM model in which spatial curvature contributes a percent of
the current cosmological energy density budget. In this model, the measured Hubble constant and
non-relativistic matter density parameter are in good agreement with values determined using
most other data. Depending on parameter values, the closed XCDM model has reduced power, relative
to the tilted, spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM case, and appears to partially alleviate the low multipole
CMB temperature anisotropy deficit and can help partially reconcile the CMB anisotropy and weak
lensing $\sigma_8$ constraints, at the expense of somewhat worsening the fit to higher multipole
CMB temperature anisotropy data. However, the closed XCDM inflation model does not seem to improve
the agreement much, if at all, compared to the closed $\Lambda$CDM inflation case, even though it
has one more free parameter. Our results are interesting but tentative; a more thorough analysis
is needed to properly gauge their significance.
