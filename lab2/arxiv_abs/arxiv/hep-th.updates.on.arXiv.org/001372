We perform the 4-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of the 5-dimensional locally scale invariant
Weyl-Dirac gravity. While compactification unavoidably introduces an explicit length scale
into the theory, it does it in such a way that the KK radius can be integrated out from the low energy
regime, leaving the KK vacuum to still enjoy local scale invariance at the classical level. Imitating
a $U(1)\times\tilde{U}(1)$ gauge theory, the emerging 4D theory is characterized by a kinetic
Maxwell-Weyl mixing whose diagonalization procedure is carried out in detail. In particular,
we identify the unique linear combination which defines the 4D Weyl vector, and fully classify the
4D scalar sector. The later consists of (using Weyl language) a co-scalar and two in-scalars. The
analysis is performed for a general KK $m$-ansatz, parametrized by the power $m$ of the scalar field
which factorizes the 4D metric. The no-ghost requirement, for example, is met provided $-\frac{1}{2}\leq
m \leq 0$. An $m$-dependent dictionary is then established between the original 5D Brans-Dicke
parameter $\omega_5$ and the resulting 4D $\omega_4$. The critical $\omega_5=-\frac{4}{3}$
is consistently mapped into critical $\omega_4 = -\frac{3}{2}$. The KK reduced Maxwell-Weyl kinetic
mixing cannot be scaled away as it is mediated by a 4D in-scalar (residing within the 5D Weyl vector).
The mixing is explicitly demonstrated within the Einstein frame for the special physically motivated
choice of $m=-\frac{1}{3}$. For instance, a super critical Brans-Dicke parameter induces a tiny
positive contribution to the original (if introduced via the 5-dimensional scalar potential)
cosmological constant. Finally, some no-scale quantum cosmological aspects are studied at the
universal mini-superspace level.
