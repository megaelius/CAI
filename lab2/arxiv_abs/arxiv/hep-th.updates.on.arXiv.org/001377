We review the (2+1)-dimensional Ba\u nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole solution in conformally
invariant gravity, uplifted to (3+1)-dimensional spacetime. As matter content we use a scalar-gauge
field. The metric is written as $g_{\mu\nu}=\omega^2\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$, where the dilaton field
$\omega$ contains all the scale dependencies and where $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ represents the "un-physical"
spacetime. A numerical solution is presented and shows how the dilaton can be treated on equal footing
with the scalar field. The location of the apparent horizon and ergo-surface depends critically
on the parameters and initial values of the model. It is not a hard task to find suitable initial parameters
in order to obtain a regular and singular free $g_{\mu\nu}$ out of a BTZ-type solution for $\tilde
g_{\mu\nu}$. In the vacuum situation, an exact time-dependent solution in the Eddington-Finkelstein
coordinates is found, which is valid for the (2+1)-dimensional BTZ spacetime as well as for the uplifted
(3+1)-dimensional BTZ spacetime. While $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ resembles the standard BTZ solution
with its horizons, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is flat. The dilaton field becomes infinitesimal and is then a renormalizable
quantum field, which switches on and off Hawking radiation. This solution can be used to investigate
the small distance scale of the model and the black hole complementarity issues. It can also be used
to describe the problem how to map the quantum states of the outgoing radiation as seen by a distant
observer and the ingoing by a local observer in a one-to one way. The two observers will use a different
conformal gauge. A possible connection is made with the antipodal indentification and unitarity
issues.
