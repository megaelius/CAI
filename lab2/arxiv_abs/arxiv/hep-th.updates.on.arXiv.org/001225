A fuzzy geometry is a certain type of spectral triple whose Dirac operator crucially turns out to
be a finite matrix. This notion was introduced in [J. Barrett, J. Math. Phys. 56, 082301 (2015)] and
accommodates familiar fuzzy spaces like spheres and tori. In the framework of random noncommutatative
geometry, we use Barrett's characterization of Dirac operators of fuzzy geometries in order to
systematically compute the spectral action $S(D)= \mathrm{Tr} f(D)$ for $2n$-dimensional fuzzy
geometries. In contrast to the original Chamseddine-Connes spectral action, we take a polynomial
$f$ with $f(x)\to \infty$ as $ |x|\to\infty$ in order to obtain a well-defined path integral that
can be stated as a random matrix model with action of the type $S(D)=N \cdot \mathrm{tr}\, F+\textstyle\sum_i
\mathrm{tr}\,A_i \cdot \mathrm{tr} \,B_i $, being $F,A_i $ and $B_i $ noncommutative polynomials
in $2^{2n-1}$ complex $N\times N$ matrices that parametrize the Dirac operator $D$. For arbitrary
signature---thus for any admissible KO-dimension---formulas for 2-dimensional fuzzy geometries
are given up to a sextic polynomial, and up to a quartic polynomial for 4-dimensional ones, with focus
on the octo-matrix models for Lorentzian and Riemannian signatures. The noncommutatative polynomials
$F,A_i $ and $B_i$ are obtained via chord diagrams and satisfy: independence of $N$; self-adjointness
of the main polynomial $F$ (modulo cyclic reordering of each monomial); also up to cyclicity, either
self-adjointness or anti-self-adjointness of $A_i $ and $B_i $ simultaneously, for fixed $i$.
Collectively, this favors a free probabilistic perspective for the large-$N$ limit we elaborate
on.
