A remarkable connection between perturbative scattering amplitudes of four-dimensional planar
SYM, and the stratification of the positive grassmannian, was revealed in the seminal work of Arkani-Hamed
et. al. Similar extension for three-dimensional ABJM theory was proposed. Here we establish a direct
connection between planar scattering amplitudes of ABJM theory, and singularities there of, to
the stratification of the positive orthogonal grassmannian. In particular, scattering processes
are constructed through on-shell diagrams, which are simply iterative gluing of the fundamental
four-point amplitude. Each diagram is then equivalent to the merging of fundamental OG_2 orthogonal
grassmannian to form a larger OG_k, where 2k is the number of external particles. The invariant information
that is encoded in each diagram is precisely this stratification. This information can be easily
read off via permutation paths of the on-shell diagram, which also can be used to derive a canonical
representation of OG_k that manifests the vanishing of consecutive minors as the singularity of
all on-shell diagrams. Quite remarkably, for the BCFW recursion representation of the tree-level
amplitudes, the on-shell diagram manifests the presence of all physical factorization poles,
as well as the cancellation of the spurious poles. After analytically continuing the orthogonal
grassmannian to split signature, we reveal that each on-shell diagram in fact resides in the positive
cell of the orthogonal grassmannian, where all minors are positive. In this language, the amplitudes
of ABJM theory is simply an integral of a product of dlog forms, over the positive orthogonal grassmannian.
