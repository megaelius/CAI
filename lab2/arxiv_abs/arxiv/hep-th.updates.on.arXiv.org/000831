In a recent paper [arXiv:1806.06254], we explored the space of solutions of the exotic massive 3D
gravity theory proposed in [arXiv:1806.04179]. We showed that the theory admits a rich space of
vacua, including asymptotically Anti de-Sitter (AdS) geometries obeying different types of boundary
conditions. The examples include black holes dressed with low decaying gravitons. Based on what
happens in other theories of massive gravity, we conjectured that such geometries appear on a curve
of the parameter space (chiral curve) where the exotic massive gravity on AdS with sufficiently
strong boundary conditions results dual to a 2D chiral conformal field theory. Here, we show that
this expectation is consistent with the conserved charges and thermodynamical properties of the
black holes of the theory, which have recently been computed [arXiv:1812.09525]. When the boundary
conditions are relaxed relative to the standard Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions, the theory
exhibits solutions consistent with the definition of the so-called Log-gravity. The asymptotic
behavior of these solutions presents a logarithmic term in the Fefferman-Graham expansion that,
nonetheless, is compatible with the AdS asymptotic symmetries. This long range interaction is
due to a mode of the massive gravity that becomes massless precisely on the chiral curve. We construct
exact solutions exhibiting this behavior, which admit to be interpreted as fully backreacting
gravitational waves propagating on an extremal black hole, and carrying non-vanishing gravitational
energy. We also discuss other vacua of the theory, such as Warped-AdS$_3$ black holes, gravitational
waves on such backgrounds, AdS$_2\times S^1$ spaces, and black holes in dS$_3$ space.
