In recent work of Cachazo, Guevara, Mizera and the author, a generalization of the biadjoint scattering
amplitude $m^{(k)}(\mathbb{I}_n,\mathbb{I}_n)$ was introduced as an integral over the moduli
space of $n$ points in $\mathbb{CP}^{k-1}$, with value a sum of certain rational functions on the
kinematic space $\mathcal{K}_{k,n}$. It was shown there for $m^{(3)}(\mathbb{I}_6,\mathbb{I}_6)$
and later by Cachazo and Rojas that collections of poles appearing in $m^{(3)}(\mathbb{I}_7,\mathbb{I}_7)$
are compatible exactly when they are dual to collections of rays which generate the maximal faces
of a polyhedral complex known as the (nonnegative) tropical Grassmannian. In this note, we derive
a remarkable planar basis for the space of generalized kinematic invariants which coincides in
the case $k=2$ with usual standard planar multi-particle basis for the kinematic space. We implement
in Mathematica the action on formal linear combinations of planar matroid subdivisions of a boundary
operator which, together with the planar basis, determines compatibility for any given poles appearing
in the expansion of $m^{(k)}(\mathbb{I}_n,\mathbb{I}_n)$, by computing a certain combinatorial
non-crossing condition on the second hypersimplicial faces $\Delta_{2,n-(k-2)}$ of $\Delta_{k,n}$.
The algorithms are implemented in an accompanying Mathematica notebook and are evaluated on existing
tables of rays, in the form of tropical Plucker vectors, to tabulate the finest planar subdivisions
of $\Delta_{3,8},\Delta_{3,9}$ and $ \Delta_{4,8}$, or equivalently the set of maximal cones
for the corresponding nonnegative tropical Grassmannians.
