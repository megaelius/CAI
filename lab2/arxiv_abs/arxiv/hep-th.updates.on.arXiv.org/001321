Three dimensional Coulomb branches have a prominent role in the study of moduli spaces of supersymmetric
gauge theories with $8$ supercharges in $3,4,5$, and $6$ dimensions. Inspired by simply laced \3d
supersymmetric quiver gauge theories, we consider Coulomb branches constructed from non-simply
laced quivers with edge multiplicity $k$ and no flavor nodes. In a computation of the Coulomb branch
as the space of dressed monopole operators, a center-of-mass $U(1)$ symmetry needs to be ungauged.
Typically, for a simply laced theory, all choices of the ungauged $U(1)$ (i.e. all choices of ungauging
schemes) are equivalent and the Coulomb branch is unique. In this note, we study various ungauging
schemes and their effect on the resulting Coulomb branch variety. It is shown that, for a non-simply
laced quiver, inequivalent ungauging schemes exist which correspond to inequivalent Coulomb
branch varieties. Ungauging on any of the long nodes of a non-simply laced quiver yields the same
Coulomb branch $\mathcal{C}$. For choices of ungauging the $U(1)$ on a short node of rank higher
than $1$, the GNO dual magnetic lattice deforms such that it no longer corresponds to a Lie group,
and therefore, the monopole formula yields a non-valid Coulomb branch. However, if the ungauging
is performed on a short node of rank $1$, the one-dimensional magnetic lattice is rescaled conformally
along its single direction and the corresponding Coulomb branch is an orbifold of the form $\mathcal{C}/\mathbb{Z}_k$.
Ungauging schemes of $3$d Coulomb branches provide a particularly interesting and intuitive description
of a subset of actions on the nilpotent orbits studied by Kostant and Brylinski arXiv:9204.227.
The ungauging scheme analysis is carried out for minimally unbalanced $C_n$, affine $F_4$, affine
$G_2$, and twisted affine $D_4^{(3)}$ quivers, respectively.
