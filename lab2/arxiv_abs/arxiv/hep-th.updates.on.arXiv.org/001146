The search for a relation among GR, QFT and TFT is the toughest challenge of theoretical physics since
Hawking's discovery. The emergence of a temperature in spacetimes with an event horizon has unveiled
the existence of a fertile territory, where gravity, thermal and quantum effects are non-trivially
connected. Although black holes are the best arena to explore this interplay, evidences for their
existence are lacking, suggesting to address less exotic contexts. In this sense, a promising stage
is the QFT in curved space: specifically, the Unruh effect (UE) provides the first step toward unifying
the quantum and gravity worlds via the EP. Waiting for a successful theory of quantum gravity, a careful
investigation of UE, and, in particular, of any deviations of Unruh spectrum from its thermal behavior,
may thus offer a window to new physics in the limbo between GR and QFT. Here we study the connection
between geometric features of spacetime and ensuing thermal quantum phenomena from a non-traditional
perspective, based on the analysis of perturbative effects that affect the standard scenarios.
As a test bench, we consider the UE. After a discussion on the origin of UE, we examine to what extent
its distinctive profile is spoilt i) for mixed neutrinos; ii) in presence of a minimal length arising
from gravity at Planck scale. On one side, we show that the UE loses its thermality. Implications
of this are analyzed in the context of the inverse beta-decay, also in view of the debate on a possible
violation of the General Covariance of QFT. On the other, we focus on the effects induced by deformations
of HUP, exploring the possibility to constrain the GUP-parameter via UE. The question is addressed
of whether these unrelated frameworks have common roots. Along this line, we provide a unifying
perspective of these effects, which still relies on a geometric interpretation of their origin.
