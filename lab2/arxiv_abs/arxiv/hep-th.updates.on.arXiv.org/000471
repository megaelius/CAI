By using a bottom-up reconstruction technique for non-minimally coupled scalar-tensor theories,
we realize the Einstein frame attractor cosmologies in the $\Omega (\phi)$-Jordan frame. For our
approach, what is needed for the reconstruction method to work is the functional form of the non-minimal
coupling $\Omega(\phi)$ and of the scalar-to-tensor ratio, and also the assumption of the slow-roll
inflation in the $\Omega (\phi)$-Jordan frame. By appropriately choosing the scalar-to-tensor
ratio, we demonstrate that the observational indices of the attractor cosmologies can be realized
directly in the $\Omega (\phi)$-Jordan frame. We investigate the special conditions that are required
to hold true in for this realization to occur, and we provide the analytic form of the potential in
the $\Omega (\phi)$-Jordan frame. Also, by performing a conformal transformation, we find the
corresponding Einstein frame canonical scalar-tensor theory, and we calculate in detail the corresponding
observational indices. The result indicates that although the spectral index of the primordial
curvature perturbations is the same in the Jordan and Einstein frames, at leading order in the $e$-foldings
number, the scalar-to-tensor ratio differs. We discuss the possible reasons behind this discrepancy,
and we argue that the difference is due to some approximation we performed to the functional form
of the potential in the Einstein frame, in order to obtain analytical results, and also due to the
difference in the definition of the $e$-foldings number in the two frames, which is also pointed
out in the related literature. Finally, we find the $F(R)$ gravity corresponding to the Einstein
frame canonical scalar-tensor theory.
