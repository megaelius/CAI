In this first of two articles, we study a system of 2N+3 linear homogeneous second-order partial
differential equations (PDEs) in 2N variables that arise in conformal field theory (CFT) and Schramm-Loewner
Evolution (SLE). In CFT, these are null-state equations and Ward identities. They are satisfied
by partition functions central to the characterization of a statistical cluster or loop model such
as percolation, or more generally the Potts models and O(n) models, at the statistical mechanical
critical point in the continuum limit. (Certain SLE partition functions also satisfy these equations.)
The partition functions for critical lattice models contained in a polygon P with 2N sides exhibiting
free/fixed side-alternating boundary conditions are proportional to the CFT correlation function
<psi_1^c(w_1) psi_1^c(w_2) ... psi_1^c(w_{2N-1}) psi_1^c(w_{2N})>_P, where the w_i
are the vertices of P and psi_1^c is a one-leg corner operator. Partition functions conditioned
on crossing events in which clusters join the fixed sides of P in some specified connectivity are
also proportional to this correlation function. When conformally mapped onto the upper half-plane,
this correlation function satisfies the system of PDEs that we consider. This article is the first
of two in which we completely characterize the space of all solutions for this system of PDEs that
grow no faster than a power law. In this article, we prove, to within a precise technical conjecture,
that the dimension of this solution space is no more than C_N, the Nth Catalan number. In the appendix,
we propose a method for proving the mentioned conjecture. In the second article, we use the results
herein to prove that if the mentioned conjecture is true, then the solution space has dimension C_N
and is spanned by solutions constructed with the CFT Coulomb gas (contour integral) formalism.
