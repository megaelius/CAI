In this work we study the general properties of the vector field localization on $(D-d-1)$-brane
with co-dimension $d$ in asymptotically AdS spacetime. We consider a conformally flat metric with
the warp factor depending only on the transverse extra dimensions. It is known that the free gauge
field cannot be confined in co-dimension one braneworlds. Also, in most of the higher co-dimension
braneworlds a general mechanism to solve this is lacking. For the co-dimension one case such problem
of localization can be solved by using non-minimal couplings with gravity. Here we apply this mechanism
to the case of generic braneworld with arbitrary co-dimension stressing the universal aspects
that lead to localization of gauge field. We show with this that an analytical solution to the $U(1)$
gauge field (zero-mode) sector over the brane can be always obtained and it is valid for any warp factor.
The existence of this zero-mode solution has as first consequence to exclude any possible tachionic
modes of the theory. Beyond this a localization condition for this zero-mode was obtained by setting
up the bulk geometry as asymptotically AdS. Thus our solution has an universal validity independent
of the particular model considered. We also consider the scalar components of the vector field.
A drawback in the co-dimension one case is that these components are never localized simultaneously
with the gauge field. We show that when more co-dimensions are considered there is an indication
that both sectors can be localized. To conclude we obtain some conditions in which the localization
of gravity ensure localization of gauge field in this scenarios propose by us.
