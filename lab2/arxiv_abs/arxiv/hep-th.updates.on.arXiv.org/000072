We argue that in Weyl-invariant dilaton gravity theories, proposed recently by Bars et al., classical
regular black hole solutions do not contain space-time singularities. Such singularities appear
due to ill-behavior of Weyl-gauge fixing conditions, one example being the gauge in which theory
is equivalent to standard General Relativity. By working in regular gauges we obtain the following
general (classical) results: (1) singularities signal a phase transition from broken to unbroken
phase of Weyl-symmetry, (2) instead of a singularity there is a "baby-universe" inside a black hole,
(3) as a black hole decreases its mass (e.g., by Hawking radiation) there is a critical mass after
which reducing mass makes black hole bigger as viewed by outside observers (i.e., the horizon area
begins to increase, becoming infinite in the limit). These results suggest that black holes do not
evaporate completely through the process of Hawking radiation, and that some information, of possibly
unlimited amount, may simply go into the baby universe. Such scenarios may offer a resolution of
Hawking's information loss paradox without resorting to exotic concepts, such as "firewalls",
breaking of semi-classical approximation or violation of unitarity, to name a few. We emphasize
that these results are obtained in a theory which classically can be viewed as a completion of General
Relativity, without introducing new physical fields (normal or phantom) or higher-derivative
terms in the action. Though it is possible that quantum gravity effects could change this picture,
a position of building quantum theory around regular classical solutions (without singularities)
would normally be considered as a preferred starting point.
