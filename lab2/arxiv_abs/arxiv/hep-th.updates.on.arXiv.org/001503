In this paper, we study the motion of test particles around two exact charged black-hole solutions
in Einstein-{\AE}ther theory. Specifically, we first consider the quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) and their resonances generated by the particle moving in the Einstein-{\AE}ther black hole
and then turn to study the periodic orbits of the massive particles. For QPOs, we drop the usually
adopted assumptions $\nu_U=\nu_\theta$, $\nu_L=\nu_r$, and $\nu_U/\nu_L=3/2$ with $\nu_U$
($\nu_L$) and $\nu_r$ ($\nu_\theta$) being the upper (lower) frequency of QPOs and radial (vertical)
epicyclic frequency of the orbiting particles, respectively. Instead, we put-forward a new working
ansatz for which the Keplerian radius is much closer to that of the innermost stable circular orbit
and explore in detail the effects of the {\ae}ther field on the frequencies of QPOs. We then realize
good curves for the frequencies of QPOs, which fit to data of three microquasars very well by ignoring
any effects of rotation and magnetic fields. The innermost stable circular orbits (isco) of timelike
particles are also analyzed and we find the isco radius increases with increasing $c_{13}$ for the
first type black hole while decreases with increasing $c_{14}$ for the second one. We also obtain
several periodic orbits and find that they share similar taxonomy schemes as the periodic equatorial
orbits in the Schwarzschild/Kerr metrics, in addition to exact solutions for certain choices of
the Einstein-\AE ther parameters. The equations for null geodesics are also briefly considered,
where we study circular photon orbits and bending angles for gravitational lensing.
