In this paper we study the coupling of $p$-form fields with geometrical tensor fields, namely Ricci,
Einstein, Horndeski and Riemann in Randall-Sundrum scenarios with co-dimension one. We consider
delta-like and branes generated by a kink and a domain wall. We begin by a detailed study of the Kalb-Ramond
(KR) field. The generalization to $p$-forms can provide more information about the properties
and structures that can possibly be universal in the geometrical localization mechanism. We find
that the previous hypothesis that tensors with null divergence can not localize fields is valid
only for the vector case. To reach this conclusion we find a compact equation that drives the tensor
modes for any spacetime dimension, for any $p-$form and for all the non-minimal couplings above.
Another property that can be tested is the absence of resonances found in the case of vector fields.
For this we analyze the possible unstable massive modes for all the above cases via transmission
coefficient. For the Kalb-Ramond in $D=5$ with a delta-like brane we observe the absence of resonant
peaks in all types of geometrical tensor couplings. In $D=10$ and $p=3$ the same occur for Ricci,
Einstein and Horndeski coupling. However, for $D=10$, $p=3$ and the coupling with the Riemann tensor,
we observe resonant peaks even in delta like branes. Therefore the absence of resonances is also
valid only for the vector case, what makes it a very special case. For domain wall branes we observe
resonant peaks only for Ricci and Riemann coupling with the increase of relevant parameters. We
also obtain the same results for kink branes. Our conclusion is that we have more probability to observe
massive unstable modes in the Ricci and Riemann coupling.
