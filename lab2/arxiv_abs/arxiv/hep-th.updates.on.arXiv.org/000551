We discuss a new perturbation method to study the dynamics of massive vector fields on (near-)extremal
static black hole spacetimes. We start with, as our background, a rather generic class of warped
product metrics, and classify the field variables into the vector(axial)- and scalar(polar)-type
components. On this generic background, we show that for the vector-type components, the Proca
equation reduces to a single master equation, whereas the scalar-type components remain to be coupled.
Then, focusing on the case of (near-)extremal static black holes in four-dimensions, we consider
the near-horizon expansion of both the background geometry and massive vector field by a scaling
parameter $\lambda$ with the leading-order geometry being the so called near-horizon geometry.
We show that on the near-horizon geometry, thanks to its enhanced symmetry, the Proca equation for
the scalar-type components also reduces to a set of two mutually decoupled homogeneous wave equations
for two variables, plus a coupled equation through which the remaining variable is determined.
Therefore, together with the vector-type master equation, we obtain the set of three decoupled
master wave equations, which govern the three independent dynamical degrees of freedom of the massive
vector field in four-dimensions. We further expand the geometry and massive vector field with respect
to $\lambda$ and show that at each order, the Proca equation for the scalar-type components can reduce
to a set of decoupled inhomogeneous wave equations whose source terms consist only of the lower-order
variables, plus one coupled equation that determins the remaining variable. Therefore, if one
solves the master equations on the leading-order near-horizon geometry, then in principle one
can successively solve the Proca equation at any order.
