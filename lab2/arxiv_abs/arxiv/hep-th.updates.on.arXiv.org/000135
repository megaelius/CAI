We continue the programme of exploring the means of holographically decoding the geometry of spacetime
inside a black hole using the gauge/gravity correspondence. To this end, we study the behaviour
of certain extremal surfaces (focusing on those relevant for equal-time correlators and entanglement
entropy in the dual CFT) in a dynamically evolving asymptotically AdS spacetime, specifically
examining how deep such probes reach. To highlight the novel effects of putting the system far out
of equilibrium and at finite volume, we consider spherically symmetric Vaidya-AdS, describing
black hole formation by gravitational collapse of a null shell, which provides a convenient toy
model of a quantum quench in the field theory. Extremal surfaces anchored on the boundary exhibit
rather rich behaviour, whose features depend on dimension of both the spacetime and the surface,
as well as on the anchoring region. The main common feature is that they reach inside the horizon even
in the post-collapse part of the geometry. In 3-dimensional spacetime, we find that for sub-AdS-sized
black holes, the entire spacetime is accessible by the restricted class of geodesics whereas in
larger black holes a small region near the imploding shell cannot be reached by any boundary-anchored
geodesic. In higher dimensions, the deepest reach is attained by geodesics which (despite being
asymmetric) connect equal time and antipodal boundary points soon after the collapse; these can
attain spacetime regions of arbitrarily high curvature and simultaneously have smallest length.
Higher-dimensional surfaces can penetrate the horizon while anchored on the boundary at arbitrarily
late times, but are bounded away from the singularity. We also study the details of length or area
growth during thermalization. While the area of extremal surfaces increases monotonically, geodesic
length is neither monotonic nor continuous.
