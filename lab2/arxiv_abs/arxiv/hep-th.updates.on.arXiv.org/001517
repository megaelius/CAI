We extend the study of a previous publication \cite{amsot} on Schwinger-Dyson dynamical mass generation
for fermions and pseudoscalar fields (axion-like particles (ALP)), in field theories containing
Yukawa type interactions between the fermions and ALPs, by incorporating anomaly terms and/or
(constant) axial background fields. The latter are linked to some Lorentz (and CPT) violating scenarios
for leptogenesis in the early Universe. We discuss both Hermitian and non-Hermitian Yukawa interactions,
anomaly terms and axial backgrounds, which are all motivated in the context of some scenarios for
radiative (anomalous) Majorana sterile neutrino masses in string-isnpired, low-energy, effective
field theories, including attractive four-fermion interactions. We show that, for a Hermitian
Yukawa interaction, there is no (pseudo)scalar dynamical mass generation, but there is fermion
dynamical mass generation, provided one adds a bare (pseudo)scalar mass. For this case, the hermitian
anomaly terms play a similar role in inducing dynamical mass generation for fermions as the four-fermion
attractive interactions. For antihermitian Yukawa interactions, an antihermitian anomaly resists
mass generation. The axial background terms assist dynamical mass generation induced by antihermitian
Yukawa interactions, in the sense that the larger the magnitude of the background, the larger the
dynamical mass. For hermitian Yukawa interactions, however, the situation is the opposite, in
the sense that the larger the background the smaller the dynamical mass. We also compare the anomaly-induced
dynamical mass with the radiative fermion mass in models of sterile neutrinos, and find that in cases
where the dynamical mass occurs, the latter dominates over the anomalously generated radiative
sterile-neutrino mass.
