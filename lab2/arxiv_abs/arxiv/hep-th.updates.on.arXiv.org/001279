The compactification from the eleven-dimensional Ho\v{r}ava-Witten orbifold to five-dimensional
heterotic M-theory on a Schoen Calabi-Yau threefold is reviewed, as is the specific $SU(4)$ vector
bundle leading to the "heterotic standard model" in the observable sector. A formalism for consistent
hidden-sector line bundles, within the context of strongly coupled heterotic M-theory, is presented
and a specific line bundle is introduced. Anomaly cancellation and the associated bulk space five-branes
are discussed in this context. The further compactification to a four-dimensional effective theory
on a linearized BPS double domain wall is then presented to order $\kappa_{11}^{4/3}$. Specifically,
the generic constraints required for anomaly cancellation and by the linearized domain wall solution,
as well as restrictions imposed by the necessity to have positive squared gauge couplings to order
$\kappa_{11}^{4/3}$, are presented in detail. Four additional constraints are imposed, two guaranteeing
that the orbifold interval is sufficiently large and that the effective strong coupling parameter
has an acceptable value, and two enforcing that the hidden sector be compatible with both the mass
scale and gauge coupling of the $SO(10)$ unification group in the observable sector. Finally, the
expression for the Fayet-Iliopoulos term associated with an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry is presented
and its role in $N=1$ spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in the low-energy effective theory is
discussed. It is shown that $N=1$ supersymmetry can be preserved, although at the cost of giving
a mass to the $U(1)$ vector superfield in addition to its usual anomalous mass.
