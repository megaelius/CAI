Current daily paper releases are becoming increasingly large and areas of research are growing
in diversity. This makes it harder for scientists to keep up to date with current state of the art and
identify relevant work within their lines of interest. The goal of this article is to address this
problem using Machine Learning techniques. We model a scientific paper to be built as a combination
of different scientific knowledge from diverse topics into a new problem. In light of this, we implement
the unsupervised Machine Learning technique of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the corpus
of papers in a given field to: i) define and extract underlying topics in the corpus; ii) get the topics
weight vector for each paper in the corpus; and iii) get the topics weight vector for new papers. By
registering papers preferred by a user, we build a user vector of weights using the information of
the vectors of the selected papers. Hence, by performing an inner product between the user vector
and each paper in the daily Arxiv release, we can sort the papers according to the user preference
on the underlying topics. We have created the website IArxiv.org where users can read sorted daily
Arxiv releases (and more) while the algorithm learns each users preference, yielding a more accurate
sorting every day. Current IArxiv.org version runs on Arxiv categories astro-ph, gr-qc, hep-ph
and hep-th and we plan to extend to others. We propose several new useful and relevant implementations
to be additionally developed as well as new Machine Learning techniques beyond LDA to further improve
the accuracy of this new tool.
