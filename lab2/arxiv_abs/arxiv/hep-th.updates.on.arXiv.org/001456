In Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) the quantisation of General Relativity leads to precise predictions
for the eigenvalues of geometrical observables like volume and area, up to the value of the only free
parameter in the theory, the Barbero-Immirzi (BI) parameter. With the help of the eigenvalues equation
for the area operator, LQG successfully derives the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of large black
holes with isolated horizons, fixing in this limit the BI parameter as $\gamma \approx 0.274$. In
the present paper we show that a black hole with angular momentum $\hbar$ and Planck mass is eigenstate
of the area operator provided that $\gamma = \sqrt{3}/6 \approx 1.05 \times 0.274$. As the black
hole is extremal, there is no Hawking radiation and the horizon is isolated. We also show that such
a black hole can be formed in the head-on scattering of two parallel Standard Model neutrinos in the
mass state $m_2$ (assuming $m_1 = 0$). Furthermore, we use the obtained BI parameter to numerically
compute the entropy of isolated horizons with areas ranging up to $250\,l_P^2$, by counting the
number of micro-states associated to a given area. The resulting entropy has a leading term ${\cal
S} \approx 0.25\, {\cal A}$, in agreement to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. As the identification
of the above eigenstate rests on the matching between classical areas and quantum area eigenvalues,
we also present, on the basis of an effective quantum model for the Schwarzschild black hole recently
proposed by Ashtekar, Olmedo and Singh, an expression for the quantum corrected area of isolated
horizons, valid for any black hole mass. Quantum corrections are shown to be negligible for a Planck
mass black hole, of order $10^{-3}$ relative to the classical area.
