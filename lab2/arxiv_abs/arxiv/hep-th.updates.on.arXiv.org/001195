In this thesis we provide new tools to determine and explore the Landscape of four-dimensional effective
field theories originating from string and M-theory. The main aim is to introduce, within four-dimensional
effective descriptions, elements that are predicted from string theory. To this end, a hierarchy
of forms is introduced within the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity theories. The
inclusion of gauge three-forms delivers a dynamical way to generate flux-induced superpotentials.
Instead, gauge two-forms, dual descriptions of axions, may be eventually gauged by three-forms
to generate a superpotential coupling between the different chiral multiplet sectors of the theory.
The mutual constraints among the background fluxes, such as tadpole cancellations, are imposed
by gauge four-forms. A hierarchy of objects, to which the gauge forms couple, is then introduced:
four-dimensional BPS-strings, membranes and 3-branes enlarge the Landscape, allowing the background
fluxes to consistently change transversing different spacetime regions. The Freed-Witten anomaly
cancellations and the changing of tadpole cancellation conditions due to background sources are
neatly expressed by BPS-junctions of membranes ending on strings and 3-branes ending on membranes.
Membrane-mediated domain wall transitions are studied, which determine how the scalar fields
flow connecting a vacuum to another of the Landscape. According to the perturbative regime that
is scanned only some transitions are allowed, with a dramatic influence on the spectrum of objects
that can be consistently incorporated in the four-dimensional description.
