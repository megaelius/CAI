In this work, we show how states with conserved numbers of dynamical defects (strings, domain walls,
etc.) can be understood as possessing generalised global symmetries even when the microscopic
origins of these symmetries are unknown. Using this philosophy, we build an effective theory of
a $2+1$-dimensional fluid state with two perpendicular sets of immersed elastic line defects.
When the number of defects is independently conserved in each set, then the state possesses two one-form
symmetries. Normally, such viscoelastic states are described as fluids coupled to Goldstone bosons
associated with spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry caused by the underlying microscopic
structure---the principle feature of which is a transverse sound mode. At the linear, non-dissipative
level, we verify that our theory, based entirely on symmetry principles, is equivalent to a viscoelastic
theory. We then build a simple holographic dual of such a state containing dynamical gravity and
two two-form gauge fields, and use it to study its hydrodynamic and higher-energy spectral properties
characterised by non-hydrodynamic, gapped modes. Based on the holographic analysis of transverse
two-point functions, we study consistency between low-energy predictions of the bulk theory and
the effective boundary theory. Various new features of the holographic dictionary are explained
in theories with higher-form symmetries, such as the mixed-boundary-condition modification
of the quasinormal mode prescription that depends on the running coupling of the boundary double-trace
deformations. Furthermore, we examine details of low- and high-energy parts of the spectrum that
depend on temperature, line defect densities and the renormalisation group scale (dimensional
transmutation).
