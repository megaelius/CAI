The (free) graviton admits, in addition to the standard Pauli-Fierz description by means of a rank-two
symmetric tensor, a description in which one dualizes the corresponding (2,2)-curvature tensor
on one column to get a (D-2,2)-tensor, where D is the spacetime dimension. This tensor derives from
a gauge field with mixed Yound symmetry (D-3,1) called the "dual graviton" field. The dual graviton
field is related non-locally to the Pauli-Fierz field (even on-shell), in much the same way as a p-form
potential and its dual (D-p-2)-form potential are related in the theory of an abelian p-form. Since
the Pauli-Fierz field has a Young tableau with two columns (of one box each), one can contemplate
a double dual description in which one dualizes on both columns and not just on one. The double dual
curvature is now a (D-2,D-2)-tensor and derives from a gauge field with (D-3, D-3) mixed Young symmetry,
the "double dual graviton" field. We show, however, that the double dual graviton field is algebraically
and locally related to the original Pauli-Fierz field and, so, does not provide a truly new description
of the graviton. From this point of view, it plays a very different role from the dual graviton field
obtained through a single dualization. We also show that these equations can be obtained from a variational
principle in which the variables to be varied in the action are (all) the components of the double-dual
field as well as an auxiliary field with (2,1) Young symmetry. By gauge fixing the shift symmetries
of this action principle, one recovers the Pauli-Fierz action. Our approach differs from the interesting
approach based on parent actions and covers only the free, sourceless theory. Similar results are
argued to hold for higher spin gauge fields.
