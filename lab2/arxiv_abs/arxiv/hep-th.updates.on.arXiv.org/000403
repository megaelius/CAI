In this work we analyze the zero mode localization and resonances of $1/2-$spin fermions in co-dimension
one Randall-Sundrum braneworld scenarios: We consider delta-like, domain walls and deformed
domain walls membranes. Beyond the influence of the spacetime dimension $D$ we also consider three
types of couplings: (i) the standard Yukawa coupling with the scalar field and parameter $\eta_1$,
(ii) a Yukawa-dilaton coupling with two parameters $\eta_2$ and $\lambda$ and (iii) a dilaton derivative
coupling with parameter $h$. Together with the deformation parameter $s$, we end up with five free
parameter to be considered. For the zero mode we find that the localization is dependent of $D$, because
the spinorial representation changes when the bulk dimensionality is odd or even and must be treated
separately. For case (i) we find that in odd dimensions only one chirality can be localized and for
even dimension a massless Dirac spinor is trapped over the brane. In the cases (ii) and (iii) we find
that for some values of the parameters both chiralities can be localized in odd dimensions. In even
dimensions we obtain a massless Dirac spinor is trapped over the brane. We also calculated numerically
resonances for cases (ii) and (iii) by using the transfer matrix method. We find that, for deformed
defects, the increasing of $D$ induces a shift in the peaks of resonances. For a given $\lambda$ with
domain walls, we find that the resonances can show up by changing the spacetime dimensionality.
For example, the same case in $D=5$ do not induces resonances but when we consider $D=10$ one peak
of resonance is found. Therefore the introduction of more dimensions, diversely from the bosonic
case, can change drastically the zero mode and resonances in fermion fields.
