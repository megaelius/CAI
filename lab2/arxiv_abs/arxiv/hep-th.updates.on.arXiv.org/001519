We give a criterion for the complete reducibility of modules satisfying a composability condition
for a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra $V$ using the first cohomology of the algebra. For
a $V$-bimodule $M$, let $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)$ be the first cohomology of $V$ with the coefficients
in $M$. Let $\hat{Z}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)$ be the subspace of $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)$ canonically
isomorphic to the space of derivations obtained from the zero mode of the right vertex operators
of weight $1$ elements such that the difference between the skew-symmetric opposite action of the
left action and the right action on these elements are Laurent polynomials in the variable. If $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V,
M)= \hat{Z}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)$ for every $\Z$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$, then every left $V$-module
satisfying a composability condition is completely reducible. In particular, since a lower-bounded
$\Z$-graded vertex algebra $V$ is a special meromorphic open-string vertex algebra and left $V$-modules
are in fact what has been called generalized $V$-modules with lower-bounded weights (or lower-bounded
generalized $V$-modules), this result provides a cohomological criterion for the complete reducibility
of lower-bounded generalized modules for such a vertex algebra. We conjecture that the converse
of the main theorem above is also true. We also prove that when a grading-restricted vertex algebra
$V$ contains a subalgebra satisfying some familiar conditions, the composability condition for
grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules always holds and we need $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V,
M)= \hat{Z}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)$ only for every $\Z$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$ generated by a grading-restricted
subspace in our complete reducibility theorem.
