The asymptotically flat structure of $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ supergravity in three spacetime dimensions
is explored. The asymptotic symmetries are spanned by an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra,
with two independent $\hat{u}(1)$ currents of electric and magnetic type. These currents are associated
to $U(1)$ fields being even and odd under parity, respectively. Remarkably, although the $U(1)$
fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide nontrivial Sugawara-like contributions
to the BMS$_3$ generators, and hence to the energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological
spacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the $\hat{u}(1)$ charges.
If the spin structure is odd, the ground state corresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although
the anticommutator of the canonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like
$\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the ground state shifted
by the square of the electric-like $\hat{u}(1)$ charge. If the spin structure is even, the same bound
for the energy generically holds, unless the absolute value of the electric-like charge is less
than minus the mass of Minkowski spacetime in vacuum, so that the energy has to be nonnegative. The
explicit form of the Killing spinors is found for a wide class of configurations that fulfills our
boundary conditions, and they exist precisely when the corresponding bounds are saturated. It
is also shown that the spectra with periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic
fields are related by spectral flow, in a similar way as it occurs for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Virasoro
algebra. Indeed, our super-BMS$_3$ algebra can be recovered from the flat limit of the superconformal
algebra with $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$, truncating the fermionic generators of the right copy.
