The gauge principle is at the heart of a good part of fundamental physics: Starting with a group G of
so-called rigid symmetries of a functional defined over space-time Sigma, the original functional
is extended appropriately by additional Lie(G)-valued 1-form gauge fields so as to lift the symmetry
to Maps(Sigma,G). Physically relevant quantities are then to be obtained as the quotient of the
solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations by these gauge symmetries. In this article we show that
one can construct a gauge theory for a standard sigma model in arbitrary space-time dimensions where
the target metric is not invariant with respect to any rigid symmetry group, but satisfies a much
weaker condition: It is sufficient to find a collection of vector fields v_a on the target M satisfying
the extended Killing equation v_{a(i;j)}=0 for some connection acting on the index a. For regular
foliations this is equivalent to merely requiring the distribution orthogonal to the leaves to
be invariant with respect to leaf-preserving diffeomemorphisms of M. The resulting gauge theory
has the usual quotient effect with respect to the original ungauged theory: in this way, much more
general orbits can be factored out than usually considered. In some cases these are orbits that do
not correspond to an initial symmetry, but still can be generated by a finite dimensional Lie group
G. Then the presented gauging procedure leads to an ordinary gauge theory with Lie algebra valued
1-form gauge fields, but showing an unconventional transformation law. In general, however, one
finds that the notion of an ordinary structural Lie group is too restrictive and should be replaced
by the much more general notion of a structural Lie groupoid.
