A coarse-grained description for the formation and evaporation of a black hole is given within the
framework of a unitary theory of quantum gravity preserving locality, without dropping the information
that manifests as macroscopic properties of the state at late times. The resulting picture depends
strongly on the reference frame one chooses to describe the process. In one description based on
a reference frame in which the reference point stays outside the black hole horizon for sufficiently
long time, a late black hole state becomes a superposition of black holes in different locations
and with different spins, even if the back hole is formed from collapsing matter that had a well-defined
classical configuration with no angular momentum. The information about the initial state is partly
encoded in relative coefficients---especially phases---of the terms representing macroscopically
different geometries. In another description in which the reference point enters into the black
hole horizon at late times, an S-matrix description in the asymptotically Minkowski spacetime
is not applicable, but it sill allows for an "S-matrix" description in the full quantum gravitational
Hilbert space including singularity states. Relations between different descriptions are given
by unitary transformations acting on the full Hilbert space, and they in general involve superpositions
of "distant" and "infalling" descriptions. Despite the intrinsically quantum mechanical nature
of the black hole state, measurements performed by a classical physical observer are consistent
with those implied by general relativity. In particular, the recently-considered firewall phenomenon
can occur only for an exponentially fine-tuned (and intrinsically quantum mechanical) initial
state, analogous to an entropy decreasing process in a system with large degrees of freedom.
