We point out that the standard formulation of the cosmological constant problem itself is problematic
since it is trying to apply the very large scale homogeneous cosmological model to very small (Planck)
scale phenomenon. At small scales, both the spacetime and the vacuum stress energy are highly inhomogeneous
and wildly fluctuating. This is a version of Wheeler's "spacetime foam". We show that this "foamy"
structure would produce a large positive contribution to the average macroscopic spatial curvature
of the Universe. In order to cancel this contribution to match the observation, the usually defined
effective cosmological constant $\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}=\lambda_B+8\pi G\langle\rho\rangle$
has to take a large negative value. The spacetime dynamics sourced by this large negative $\lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$
would be similar to the cyclic model of the universe in the sense that at small scales every point in
space is a "micro-cyclic universe" which is following an eternal series of oscillations between
expansions and contractions. Moreover, if the bare cosmological constant $\lambda_B$ is dominant,
the size of each "micro-universe" would increase a tiny bit at a slowly accelerating rate during
each micro-cycle of the oscillation due to the weak parametric resonance effect produced by the
fluctuations of the quantum vacuum stress energy tensor. In this way, the large cosmological constant
generated at small scales is hided at observable scale and no fine-tuning of $\lambda_B$ to the accuracy
of $10^{-122}$ is needed. This at least resolves the old cosmological constant problem and suggests
that it is the quantum vacuum fluctuations serve as the dark energy which is accelerating the expansion
of our Universe.
