The evolutions of the flat FLRW universe and its linear perturbations are studied systematically
in the dressed metric approach of LQC. When it is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at
the quantum bounce, the evolution of the background can be divided into three different phases prior
to the preheating, {\em bouncing, transition and slow-roll inflation}. During the bouncing phase,
the evolution is independent of not only the initial conditions, but also the inflationary potentials.
In particular, the expansion factor can be well described by the same exact solution in all the cases
considered. In contrast, in the potential dominated case such a universality is lost. It is because
of this universality that the linear perturbations are also independent of the inflationary models
and obtained exactly. During the transition phase, the evolutions of the background and its linear
perturbations are found explicitly, and then matched to the ones given in the other two phases. Hence,
once the initial conditions are imposed, the linear scalar and tensor perturbations will be uniquely
determined. Considering two different sets of initial conditions, one imposed during the contracting
phase and the other at the bounce, we calculate the Bogoliubov coefficients and find that the two
sets yield the same results and all lead to particle creations at the onset of the inflation. Due to
the pre-inflationary dynamics, the scalar and tensor power spectra become scale-dependent. Comparing
with the Planck 2015 data, we find constraints on the total e-folds that the universe must have expanded
since the bounce, in order to be consistent with current observations.
