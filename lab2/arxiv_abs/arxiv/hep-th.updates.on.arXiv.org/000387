In this thesis we present some computations made in both sides of the AdS/CFT holographic correspondence
using the integrability of both theories. Regarding the string theory side, this thesis is focused
in the computation of the dispersion relation of closed spinning strings in some deformed $AdS_3
\times S^3$ backgrounds. In particular we are going to focus in the deformation provided by the mixing
of R-R and NS-NS fluxes and the so-called $\eta$-deformation. These computations are made using
the classical integrability of these two deformed string theories, which is provided by the presence
of a set of conserved quantities called "Uhlenbeck constants". The existence of the Uhlenbeck constants
is central for the method used to derive the dispersion relations. Regarding the gauge theory side,
we are interested in the computation of two and three-point correlation functions. Concerning
the two-point function a computation of correlation functions involving different operators
and different number of excitations is performed using the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz and the Quantum
Inverse Scattering Method. These results are compared with computations done with the Coordinate
Bethe Ansatz and with Zamolodchikov-Faddeev operators. Concerning the three-point functions,
we will explore the novel construction given by the hexagon framework. In particular we are going
to start from the already proposed hexagon form factor and rewrite it in a language more resembling
of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz. For this intent we construct an invariant vertex using Zamolodchikov-Faddeev
operators, which is checked for some simple cases.
