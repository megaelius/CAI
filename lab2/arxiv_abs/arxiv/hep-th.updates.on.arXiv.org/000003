Recent vigorous investigations of topological order have not only discovered new topological
states of matter but also shed new light to "already known" topological states. One established
example with topological order is the valence bond solid (VBS) states in quantum antiferromagnets.
The VBS states are disordered spin liquids with no spontaneous symmetry breaking but most typically
manifest topological order known as hidden string order on 1D chain. Interestingly, the VBS models
are based on mathematics analogous to fuzzy geometry. We review applications of the mathematics
of fuzzy super-geometry in the construction of supersymmetric versions of VBS (SVBS) states, and
give a pedagogical introduction of SVBS models and their properties [ arXiv:0809.4885 , 1105.3529
, 1210.0299 ]. As concrete examples, we present detail analysis of supersymmetric versions of SU(2)
and SO(5) VBS states, i.e. UOSp(N|2) and UOSp(N|4) SVBS states whose mathematics are closely related
to fuzzy two- and four-superspheres. The SVBS states are physically interpreted as hole-doped
VBS states with superconducting property that interpolate various VBS states depending on value
of a hole-doping parameter. The parent Hamiltonians for SVBS states are explicitly constructed,
and their gapped excitations are derived within the single-mode approximation on 1D SVBS chains.
Prominent features of the SVBS chains are discussed in detail, such as a generalized string order
parameter and entanglement spectra. It is realized that the entanglement spectra are at least doubly
degenerate regardless of the parity of bulk (super)spins. Stability of topological phase with
supersymmetry is discussed with emphasis on its relation to particular edge (super)spin states.
