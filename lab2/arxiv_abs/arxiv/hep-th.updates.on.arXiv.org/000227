Massless conformal scalar field in d=4 corresponds to the minimal unitary representation (minrep)
of the conformal group SU(2,2) which admits a one-parameter family of deformations that describe
massless fields of arbitrary helicity. The minrep and its deformations were obtained by quantization
of the nonlinear realization of SU(2,2) as a quasiconformal group in arXiv:0908.3624 . We show that
the generators of SU(2,2) for these unitary irreducible representations can be written as bilinears
of deformed twistorial oscillators which transform nonlinearly under the Lorentz group and apply
them to define and study higher spin algebras and superalgebras in AdS_5. The higher spin (HS) algebra
of Fradkin-Vasiliev type in AdS_5 is simply the enveloping algebra of SU(2,2) quotiented by a two-sided
ideal (Joseph ideal) which annihilates the minrep. We show that the Joseph ideal vanishes identically
for the quasiconformal realization of the minrep and its enveloping algebra leads directly to the
HS algebra in AdS_5. Furthermore, the enveloping algebras of the deformations of the minrep define
a one parameter family of HS algebras in AdS_5 for which certain 4d covariant deformations of the
Joseph ideal vanish identically. These results extend to superconformal algebras SU(2,2|N) and
we find a one parameter family of HS superalgebras as enveloping algebras of the minimal unitary
supermultiplet and its deformations. Our results suggest the existence of a family of (supersymmetric)
HS theories in AdS_5 which are dual to free (super)conformal field theories (CFTs) or to interacting
but integrable (supersymmetric) CFTs in 4d. We also discuss the corresponding picture in AdS_4
where the 3d conformal group Sp(4,R) admits only two massless representations (minreps), namely
the scalar and spinor singletons.
