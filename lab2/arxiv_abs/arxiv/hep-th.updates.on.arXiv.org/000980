We develop a novel nonperturbative approach to a class of three-point functions in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$
SYM based on Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). More specifically, we study three-point functions
of a non-BPS single-trace operator and two determinant operators dual to maximal Giant Graviton
D-branes in AdS$_5\times$S$^{5}$. They correspond to disk one-point functions on the worldsheet
and admit a simpler and more powerful integrability description than the standard single-trace
three-point functions. We first introduce two new methods to efficiently compute such correlators
at weak coupling; one based on large $N$ collective fields, which provides an example of open-closed-open
duality discussed by Gopakumar, and the other based on combinatorics. The results so obtained exhibit
a simple determinant structure and indicate that the correlator can be interpreted as a generalization
of $g$-functions in 2d QFT; an overlap between an integrable boundary state and a state corresponding
to the single-trace operator. We then determine the boundary state at finite coupling using the
symmetry, the crossing equation and the boundary Yang-Baxter equation. With the resulting boundary
state, we derive the ground-state $g$-function based on TBA and conjecture its generalization
to other states. This is the first fully nonperturbative proposal for the structure constants of
operators of finite length. The results are tested extensively at weak and strong couplings. Finally,
we point out that determinant operators can provide better probes of sub-AdS locality than single-trace
operators and discuss possible applications.
