This paper continues our previous study of similar theories in \cite{ch5}. We also consider here
the ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-like theories with $SU(N_c)$ colors (and their Seiberg's dual with $SU(N_F-N_c)$
dual colors) and $N_F$ flavors of light quarks, and with $N_F^2$ additional colorless flavored
fields $\Phi^j_i$, but now with $N_F$ in the range $2N_c<N_F<3N_c$. The multiplicities of various
vacua and quark and gluino condensates in these vacua are found. The mass spectra of the direct and
Seiberg's dual theories in various vacua are calculated within the dynamical scenario which assumes
that quarks in such ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-like theories can be in two {\it standard} phases only. These
are either the HQ (heavy quark) phase where they are confined or the Higgs phase. The word {\it standard}
implies here also that, in such ${\cal N}=1$ theories without elementary colored adjoint scalars,
no {\it additional} parametrically light solitons (e.g. magnetic monopoles or dyons) are formed
at those scales where quarks decouple as heavy or are higgsed. Recall that this scenario satisfies
all those tests which were used as checks of the Seiberg hypothesis about the equivalence of the direct
and dual theories. The mass spectra of these direct and Seiberg's dual theories calculated within
this framework were found to be different, in general. These parametrical differences of mass spectra
of direct and dual theories show, in particular, that all those tests, which were used as checks of
the Seiberg hypothesis about the equivalence of the direct and dual theories, although necessary,
may well be insufficient. Besides, the mass spectrum of the dual theory with $SU(N_F-N_c)$ colors
and $N_c+1<N_F<3N_c/2$ dual quark flavors was calculated. And finally, considered is the direct
${\cal N}=2$ SQCD with $SU(N_c)$ colors and $N_c+1<N_F<3N_c/2$ flavors of light quarks...
