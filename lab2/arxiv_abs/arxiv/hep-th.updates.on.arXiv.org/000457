We present the Hamiltonian formalism for $f(T)$ gravity, and prove that the theory has $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}+1$
degrees of freedom in $n$ dimensions. We start from a scalar-tensor action for the theory, that represents
a scalar field minimally coupled with the torsion scalar $T$ that defines the TEGR Lagrangian. $T$
is written as a quadratic form of the coefficients of anholonomy of the vierbein. We obtain the primary
constraints through the analysis of the structure of the eigenvalues of the multi-index matrix
involved in the definition of the canonical momenta. The auxiliar scalar field generates one extra
primary constraint when compared with the TEGR case. The secondary constraints are the super-Hamiltonian
and super-momenta constraints, that are preserved from the ADM formulation of GR. There is a set
of $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ primary constraints that represent the local Lorentz transformations
of the theory, which can be combined to form a set of $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-1$ first class constraints,
while one of them become second class. This result is irrespective of the dimension, due to the structure
of the matrix of the brackets between the constraints. The first-class canonical Hamiltonian is
modified due to this local Lorentz violation, and the only one local Lorentz transformation that
becomes second class pairs up with the second class constraint $\pi \approx 0$ to remove one degree
of freedom from the $n^2+1$ pairs of canonical variables. The remaining $2n-1+\frac{n(n-1)}{2}
- 1 $ primary constraint remove the same number of degrees of freedom, leaving the theory with $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}+1$
degrees of freedom. This means that $f(T)$ gravity has only one extra degree of freedom, which could
be interpreted as a scalar degree of freedom.
