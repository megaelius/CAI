Surface operators in the 6d (2,0) theory at large $N$ have a holographic description in terms of M2
branes probing the AdS$_7 \times S^4$ M-theory background. The most symmetric, 1/2-BPS, operator
is defined over a planar or spherical surface, and it preserves a 2d superconformal group. This includes,
in particular, an $SO(2,2)$ subgroup of 2d conformal transformations, so that the surface operator
may be viewed as a conformal defect in the 6d theory. The dual M2 brane has an AdS$_3$ induced geometry,
reflecting the 2d conformal symmetry. Here we use the holographic description to extract the defect
CFT data associated to the surface operator. The spectrum of transverse fluctuations of the M2 brane
is found to be in one-to-one correspondence with a protected multiplet of operator insertions on
the surface, which includes the displacement operator. We compute the one-loop determinants of
fluctuations of the M2 brane, and extract the conformal anomaly coefficient of the spherical surface
to order $N^0$, obtaining precise agreement with a recent exact prediction. We also briefly discuss
the RG flow from the non-supersymmetric to the 1/2-BPS defect operator, and its consistency with
a "$b$-theorem" for the defect CFT. Starting with the M2 brane action, we then use AdS$_3$ Witten
diagrams to compute the 4-point functions of the elementary bosonic insertions on the surface operator,
and extract some of the defect CFT data from the OPE. The 4-point function is shown to satisfy superconformal
Ward identities, and we discuss a related subsector of "twisted" scalar insertions, whose correlation
functions are constrained by the residual superconformal symmetry.
