In this thesis we have obtained and studied the complete set of superfield equations of motion for
the interacting system of four-dimensional supermembrane and dynamical scalar multiplet. This
study provides the first example of superfield equations for interacting system involving matter
superfields and extended supersymmetric object, as well as the first set of superfield equations
of motion for a dynamical system which includes supermembrane. The action for a supermembrane in
a N = 1 D = 4 chiral superfield background has been also presented for the first time. We have obtained
the complete set of equations of motion in spacetime components for the interacting system of dynamical
D = 4 N = 1 supergravity and supermembrane from the superfield equations. To this end we have developed
the Wess - Zumino approach type to Grisaru - Siegel - Gates - Ovrut - Waldram special minimal supergravity
characterized by a dynamically generated cosmological constant. We have also found the superfield
equations in N-extended tensorial superspaces with N = 2,4 and 8, which describe the D = 4 supermultiplets
of massless conformal higher spin theory with N-extended supersymmetry. On the other hand, we have
obtained the equations of motion of the system of multiple M0-brane derived from the covariant,
supersymmetric and kappa-symmetric action proposed for such a system . We have also studied the
gauge symmetries of the action which allows us to find the final form of the bosonic equations of motion
for the center of energy coordinate functions. We have also shown that all BPS states of the system
are (1/2)BPS states and have the same properties as the BPS states of a single M0-brane.
