Boundaries in gauge theories are a delicate issue. Arbitrary boundary choices enter the calculation
of charges via Noether's second theorem, obstructing the assignment of unambiguous physical charges
to local gauge symmetries. Replacing the arbitrary boundary choice with new degrees of freedom
suggest itself for solving these problems. But, concretely, such boundary degrees of freedom are
spurious---i.e. they are not part of the original field content of the theory---and have to disappear
upon gluing. How should we fit them into what we know about field-theory? We resolve these issues
in a unified and geometric manner, by introducing a connection 1-form, $\varpi$, in the field-space
of Yang--Mills theory. Using this geometric tool, a modified version of symplectic geometry---here
called `horizontal'---is possible. Independently of boundary conditions, this formalism bestows
to each region a physical notion of charge: the horizontal Noether charge. The horizontal gauge
charges always vanish, while global charges still arise for reducible configurations characterized
by global symmetries. The field-content itself is used as a reference frame to distinguish `gauge'
and `physical'; no new degrees of freedom, such as group-valued edge modes, are required. Different
choices of reference fields give different $\varpi$'s, which are cousins of gauge-fixings like
the Higgs-unitary and Coulomb gauges. But the formalism extends well beyond gauge-fixings, for
instance by avoiding the Gribov problem. For one choice of $\varpi$, would-be Goldstone modes arising
from the condensation of matter degrees of freedom play precisely the role of the known group-valued
edge modes, but here they arise as preferred coordinates in field space, rather than new fields.
For another choice, in the Abelian case, $\varpi$ recovers the Dirac dressing of the electron.
