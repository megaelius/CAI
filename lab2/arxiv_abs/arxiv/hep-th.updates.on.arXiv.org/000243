We investigate the cosmology of a braneworld model in which matter is localized on a five dimensional
brane consisting of four infinite dimensions and one compact extra dimension. Only gravity can
propagate into the bulk, which has one additional infinite extra dimension. We also include a 5D
brane induced gravity term on the brane, so the model can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known
DGP model by adding one compact extra dimension to the brane. We show that for a brane source with FRW
symmetries, the geometry of this set-up allows to implement an outgoing wave condition which in
turn makes it possible to derive a closed system of local modified Friedmann equations. Furthermore,
we show that there is a subclass of these solutions in which the Newton-like components of the bulk
gravitational field (analogous to the Schwarzschild mass parameter in the DGP case) vanish, and
the bulk curvature is only due to gravitational waves emitted by the brane. If the compact extra dimension
is stabilized, these waves are absent and one exactly reproduces DGP cosmology on the brane. However,
it is shown that a stabilization by means of physical matter is not possible for a tension dominated
braneworld, thus implying a late time modification of the 4D Friedmann cosmology different from
the one in the DGP model. On the other hand, if the compact direction is allowed to expand, we find exact
solutions with zero 4D Hubble parameter despite the presence of a 4D cosmological constant. Moreover,
we show numerically that these are in fact attractor solutions. The model hence constitutes an explicit
example of a dynamical degravitation mechanism at the full nonlinear level. Without stabilization,
however, the model does not incorporate a 4D regime and is thus ruled out observationally, as we demonstrate
explicitly by comparing to supernova data.
