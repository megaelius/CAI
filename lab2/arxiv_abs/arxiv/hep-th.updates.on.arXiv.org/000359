We present how to construct a Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for gravity at the leading and
next-to-leading powers from the ground up. The soft graviton theorem and the decoupling of collinear
gravitons at the leading power are manifest in the structure of the effective lagrangian. Simple
structures of amplitudes, which are completely obscure in Feynman diagrams of the full theory,
are also revealed at the next-to-leading power, greatly simplifying calculations. The effective
lagrangian is highly constrained by multiple copies of effective diffeomorphism invariance that
are inevitably present in gravity SCET due to mode separation, an essential ingredient of any SCET.
Characteristic to SCET, gravity SCET is a nonlocal theory in that not only the interactions are nonlocal
but also the field operators themselves and their (anti-)commutators are "smeared". On top of this
smearing, the multiple diffeomorphism invariances imply specific forms of further nonlocal "dressing"
of the field operators. Nevertheless, a gravity SCET that is matched onto a local full theory must
somehow "conspire" to be local. A close examination of such conspiracy, especially the comparison
of how it works in gravity and gauge-theory SCETs, may give us some insight on what could be actually
going on in a truly nonlocal theory like the putative quantum theory of gravity. The structure of
gravity SCET may also shed light on lagrangian-level understandings of some of the surprising properties
of gravitational scattering amplitudes such as infinite dimensional asymptotic symmetries.
A gravity SCET with an appropriate inclusion of Glauber modes may also serve as a powerful tool for
studying gravitational scattering in the Regge limit.
