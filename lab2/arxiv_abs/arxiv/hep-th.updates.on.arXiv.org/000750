Within the framework of DBI non-canonical scalar field model of dark energy, we study the growth
of dark matter perturbations in the both linear and non-linear regimes. In our DBI model, we consider
the anti-de Sitter warp factor $f(\phi)=f_0\, \phi^{-4}$ with constant $f_0>0$ and assume the
DBI dark energy to be clustered and its sound speed $c_s$ to be constant. For a spatially flat FRW universe
filled with pressureless dark matter and DBI dark energy, we first obtain the evolutionary behaviors
of the background quantities. Our results show that in our DBI model, the universe starts from a matter
dominated epoch and approaches to the de Sitter universe at late times, as expected. Also the DBI
potential behaves like the power law one $V(\phi)\propto \phi^n$. In addition, we use the Pseudo-Newtonian
formalism to obtain the growth factor of dark matter perturbations in the linear regime. We conclude
that for smaller $c_s$ (or $f_0$), the growth factor of dark matter is smaller for clustering DBI
model compared to the homogeneous one. In the following, in the non-linear regime based on the spherical
collapse model, we obtain the linear overdensity $\delta_c(z_c)$, the virial overdensity $\Delta_{\rm
vir}(z_c)$, overdensity at the turn around $\zeta(z_c)$ and the rate of expansion of collapsed
region $h_{\rm ta}(z)$. We point out that for the smaller $c_s$ (or $\tilde{f}_0$), the values of
$\delta_c(z_c)$, $\Delta_{\rm vir}(z_c)$, $\zeta(z_c)$ and $h_{\rm ta}(z)$ in non-clustering
DBI models deviate more than the $\Lambda$CDM compared to the clustering DBI. Finally, with the
help of spherical collapse parameters we calculated the relative number density of halo objects
above a given mass and conclude that the differences between clustering and homogeneous DBI models
are more pronounced for higher-mass halos at high redshift.
