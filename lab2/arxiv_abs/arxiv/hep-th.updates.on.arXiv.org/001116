The formation of Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superfluidity,
and the condensation of pre-formed bosonic particles in Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) are
connected to each other by a continuous deformation of the interaction strength. This is referred
to as the BCS-BEC crossover, and may be probed by solitonic configurations that exist in both cases.
In holographic superfluids that describe strongly interacting phases of matter, the BCS-BEC crossover
can be achieved by changing the boundary conditions for the charged scalar field dual to the order
parameter condensate. This mechanism has been considered previously in the probe limit, neglecting
the backreaction of the order parameter condensate on the dual geometry. In this work, we include
the backreaction to investigate the BCS and BEC limits by constructing the corresponding dark soliton
configurations in holography. The strength of backreaction is parametrized by the Newton constant
in the holographic bulk dual. We study the dependence of the charge depletion and energy density
in the core of the soliton on the backreaction strength. We find that the charge depletion at the core
of the soliton decreases with increasing backreaction strength. We interpret this qualitatively
in terms of the balance between uncondensed and condensed charge in the boundary theory as a homogeneous
state is reached at strong backreaction. Finally, the inclusion of backreaction enables us to obtain
the effective energy density of the soliton configurations, which together with a calculation
of the surface tension enables us to confirm the explanation of the snake instability of dark solitons
by a simple physical argument within holography.
