We study the thermodynamic properties of a two-site coupled complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model
in the large $N$ limit by solving the saddle-point Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations. We find that
its phase diagram is richer than in the Majorana case. In the grand canonical ensemble, we identify
a region of small chemical potential, and weak coupling between the two SYKs, for which two first
order thermodynamic phase transitions occur as a function of temperature. First, we observe a transition
from a cold wormhole phase to an intermediate phase that may correspond to a charged wormhole. For
a higher temperature, there is another first order transition to the black hole phase. As in the Majorana
case, the low temperature wormhole phase is gapped and, for sufficiently large coupling between
the two complex SYK, or chemical potential, the first order transitions become crossovers. The
total charge is good indicator to study the phase diagram of the model: it is zero in the cold wormhole
phase and jumps discontinuously at the temperatures at which the transitions take place. Based
on the approximate conformal symmetry of the ground state, expected to be close to a thermofield
double state, we identify the effective low energy action of the model. It is a generalized Schwarzian
action with $SL(2,R)\times U(1)$ symmetry with an additional potential and a extra degree of freedom
related to the charge. In the large $N$ limit, results from this low energy action are consistent
with those from the solution of the SD equations. Our findings are a preliminary step towards the
characterization of traversable wormholes by its field theory dual, a strongly interacting fermionic
system with charger, that is easier to model experimentally.
