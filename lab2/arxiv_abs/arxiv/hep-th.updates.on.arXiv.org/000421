It has recently been demonstrated that black hole dynamics at large D is dual to the motion of a probe
membrane propagating in the background of a spacetime that solves Einstein's equations. The equation
of motion of this membrane is determined by the membrane stress tensor. In this paper we `improve'
the membrane stress tensor derived in earlier work to ensure that it defines consistent probe membrane
dynamics even at finite $D$ while reducing to previous results at large D. Our improved stress tensor
is the sum of a Brown York term and a fluid energy momentum tensor. The fluid has an unusual equation
of state; its pressure is nontrivial but its energy density vanishes. We demonstrate that all stationary
solutions of our membrane equations are produced by the extremisation of an action functional of
the membrane shape. Our action is an offshell generalization of the membrane's thermodynamical
partition function. We demonstrate that the thermodynamics of static spherical membranes in flat
space and global AdS space exactly reproduces the thermodynamics of the dual Schwarzschild black
holes even at finite D. We study the long wavelength dynamics of membranes in AdS space, and demonstrate
that the boundary `shadow' of this membrane dynamics is boundary hydrodynamics with with a definite
constitutive relation. We determine the explicit form of shadow dual boundary stress tensor upto
second order in derivatives of the boundary temperature and velocity, and verify that this stress
tensor agrees exactly with the fluid gravity stress tensor to first order in derivatives, but deviates
from the later at second order and finite D.
