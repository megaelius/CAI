The model of dual superconductivity has been revisited considering the $U(1)$-gauged Ginzburg-Landau
lagrangian density on a non-commutative torus $T^{2}_{NC}$, according to a new approach, we propose,
in dealing with non-commutative space coordinates ($[\hat{x},\hat{y}]=i\theta$). This led
to consider a different set of the twist matrices $\Omega_{\mu}$ relative to $T^{2}_{NC}$, since
the corrisponding set, adopted in previous works, has resulted to be incompatible with the homogeneity
of $T^{2}_{NC}$. We have also found that the index labelling the twists $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ no longer
has the usual physical role. In fact, the energy, suitably rewritten, of the minimum configurations
at the point of Bogomolny and the quark color-electric charge $q_{e}$ depend on $r_{\theta}=\theta_{C}/\theta_{NC}\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0\}$,
where $\theta_{C}$ ($\theta_{NC}$) is the parameter that characterizes the commutative torus
$T^{2}_{C}$ ($T^{2}_{NC}$): here $T^{2}_{C}$ is not characterized only by a $\theta$ null. The
quantity $r_{\theta}$ was then found to determine the order of a cyclic subgroup of $U(1)$ generated
by $e^{i\pi\theta_{NC}}$. Therefore here $q_{e}$ can also be a fraction as well as a multiple of
$g^{-1}$, where $g$ is the magnetic charge of the scalar field. Furthermore, the above energy was
calculated only considering a class of the twisted boundary conditions solutions without solving,
as usual, any system of equations such as the BPS. Another novelty is the presence of a double Higgs
mechanism regulated by $r_{\theta}$. In this regard, it predicts, in general, a non null mass for
the usual massless Goldstone boson and establishes a relation between the mass spectrum and $r_{\theta}$
according to which a variation over time of $r_{\theta}$ involves a quantized variation in time
of such masses that will be null when $r_{\theta}$ assumes values outside a certain interval of values.
