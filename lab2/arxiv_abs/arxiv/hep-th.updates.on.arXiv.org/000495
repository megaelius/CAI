A great deal of effort has recently been invested in developing methods of calculating scattering
amplitudes that bypass the traditional construction based on Lagrangians and Feynman rules. Motivated
by this progress, we investigate the long-wavelength behavior of scattering amplitudes of massless
scalar particles: Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons. The low-energy dynamics of NG bosons is governed
by the underlying spontaneously broken symmetry, which likewise allows one to bypass the Lagrangian
and connect the scaling of the scattering amplitudes directly to the Lie algebra of the symmetry
generators. We focus on theories with enhanced soft limits, where the scattering amplitudes scale
with a higher power of momentum than expected based on the mere existence of Adler's zero. Our approach
is complementary to that developed recently by Cheung et al., and in the first step we reproduce their
result. That is, as far as Lorentz-invariant theories with a single physical NG boson are concerned,
we find no other nontrivial theories featuring enhanced soft limits beyond the already well-known
ones: the Galileon and the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar. Next, we show that in a certain sense,
these theories do not admit a nontrivial generalization to non-Abelian internal symmetries. Namely,
for compact internal symmetry groups, all NG bosons featuring enhanced soft limits necessarily
belong to the center of the group. For noncompact symmetry groups such as the ISO($n$) group featured
by some multi-Galileon theories, these NG bosons then necessarily belong to an Abelian normal subgroup.
The Lie-algebraic consistency constraints admit two infinite classes of solutions, generalizing
the known multi-Galileon and multi-flavor DBI theories.
