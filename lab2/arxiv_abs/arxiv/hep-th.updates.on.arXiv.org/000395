The Dimensional Regularization of Bollini and Giambiags (Phys. Lett. {\bf B 40}, 566 (1972), Il
Nuovo Cim. {\bf B 12}, 20 (1972). Phys. Rev. {\bf D 53}, 5761 (1996)) can not be defined for all Schwartz
Tempered Distributions Explicitly Lorentz Invariant (STDELI) ${\cal S}^{'}_L$. In this paper
we overcome here such limitation and show that it can be generalized to all aforementioned STDELI
and obtain a product in a ring with zero divisors. For this purpose, we resort to a formula obtained
in [Int. J. of Theor. Phys. {\bf 43}, 1019 (2004)] and demonstrate the existence of the convolution
(in Minkowskian space) of such distributions. This is done by following a procedure similar to that
used so as to define a general convolution between the Ultradistributions of J. Sebastiao e Silva
[Math. Ann. {\bf 136}, 38 (1958)], also known as Ultrahyperfunctions, obtained by Bollini et al.
[Int. J. of Theor. Phys. {\bf 38}, 2315 (1999), {\bf 43}, 1019 (2004), {\bf 43}, 59 (2004),{\bf 46},
3030 (2007)]. Using the Inverse Fourier Transform we get the ring with zero divisors ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA}$,
defined as ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA}={\cal F}^{-1}\{{\cal S}^{'}_L\}$, where ${\cal F}^{-1}$ denotes
the Inverse Fourier Transform. In this manner we effect a dimensional regularization in momentum
space (the ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{L}$) via convolution, and a product of distributions in the corresponding
configuration space (the ring ${\cal S}^{'}_{LA})$. This generalizes the results obtained by
Bollini and Giambiagi for Euclidean space in [Phys. Rev. {\bf D 53}, 5761 (1996)]. We provide several
examples of the application of our new results in Quantum Field Theory. In particular, the convolution
of $n$ massless Feynman propagators and the convolution of n massless Wheeler propagators in Minkowskian
space.
