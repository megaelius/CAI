In this thesis we apply techniques from quantum information theory to study quantum gravity within
the framework of the anti-de Sitter / conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT). Through
AdS/CFT, progress has been made in understanding the structure of entanglement in quantum field
theories, and in how gravitational physics can emerge from these structures. However, this understanding
is far from complete and will require the development of new tools to quantify correlations in CFT.
This thesis presents refinements of a duality between operator product expansion (OPE) blocks
in the CFT, giving the contribution of a conformal family to the OPE, and geodesic integrated fields
in AdS which are diffeomorphism invariant quantities. This duality was originally discovered
in the maximally symmetric setting of pure AdS dual to the CFT ground state. In less symmetric states
the duality must be modified. Working with excited states within AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, this thesis
shows how the OPE block decomposes into more fine-grained CFT observables that are dual to AdS fields
integrated over non-minimal geodesics. Additionally, this thesis contains results on the dynamics
of entanglement measures for general quantum systems. Results are presented for the family of quantum
R\'enyi entropies and entanglement negativity. R\'enyi entropies are studied for general dynamics
by imposing special initial conditions. Around pure, separable initial states, all R\'enyi entropies
grow with the same timescale at leading, and next-to-leading order. Mathematical tools are developed
for the differentiation of non-analytic matrix functions with respect to constrained arguments
and are used to construct analytic expressions for derivatives of negativity. We establish bounds
on the rate of change of state distinguishability and the rate of entanglement growth for closed
systems. Note: Abstract shortened.
