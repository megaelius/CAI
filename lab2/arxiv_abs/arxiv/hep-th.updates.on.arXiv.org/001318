This paper is an immediate continuation of the first part of our paper [1]. Here, in a para-Grassmann
algebra we introduce a noncommutative, associative star product $*$ (the Moyal product), which
is a direct generalization of the star product in the algebra of Grassmann numbers. Isomorphism
between the algebra of para-Grassmann numbers of order 2 equipped with the star product and with
the algebra of creation and annihilation operators $a_{n}^{\pm}$ obeying the para-Fermi statistics
of the same order is established. Two independent approaches to the calculation of the Moyal product
$*$ are considered. It is shown that in calculating the matrix elements in the basis of parafermion
coherent states of various expressions it should be taken into account constantly that we work in
the so-called Ohnuki and Kamefuchi's generalized state-vector space $\mathfrak{U}_{\;G}$,
whose state vectors include para-Grassmann numbers $\xi_{k}$ in their definition, instead of
the standard state-vector space $\mathfrak{U}$ (the Fock space). Otherwise, the wide array of
contradictions arises. An immediate consequence of using the extended state-vector space $\mathfrak{U}_{\;G}$
is a necessity to consider the quadratic Casimir operators $\hat{C}_{2}$ and $\hat{C}_{2}^{\prime}$
of the orthogonal groups $SO(2M)$ and $SO(2M + 1)$, correspondingly. The action rules of the Casimir
operators on the state vectors, an explicit form of their matrix elements are defined and a more general
connection between the Harish-Chandra operator $\hat{\omega}^2$ and the Geyer operator $a_{0}^{2}$
is obtained. The notions of the triple star product, the star exponent and the Moyal bracket are introduced.
