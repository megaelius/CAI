We investigate the quantum field aspects in flat spacetime for an uniformly accelerated observer
moving in a thermal bath. In particular, we obtain an exact closed expression of the reduced density
matrix for an uniformly accelerated observer with acceleration $a = 2\pi T$ when the state of the
quantum field is a thermal bath at temperature $T^\prime$. We find that the density matrix has a simple
form with an effective partition function $Z$ being a product, $Z = Z_T Z_{T^\prime}$, of two thermal
partition functions corresponding to temperatures $T$ and $T^\prime$ and hence is not thermal,
even when $T = T^\prime$. We show that, even though the partition function has a product structure,
the two thermal baths are, in fact, interacting systems; although in the high frequency limit $\omega_k
\gg T$ and $\omega_k \gg T^\prime$, the interactions are found to become sub-dominant. We further
demonstrate that the resulting spectrum of the Rindler particles can be interpreted in terms of
spontaneous and stimulated emission due to the background thermal bath. The density matrix is also
found to be symmetric in the acceleration temperature $T$ and the thermal bath temperature $T^\prime$
indicating that thermodynamic experiments alone cannot distinguish between the thermal effects
due to $T$ and those due to $T^\prime$. The entanglement entropy associated with the reduced density
matrix (with the background contribution of the Davies-Unruh bath removed) is shown to satisfy,
in the $\omega_k \gg T^\prime$ limit, a first law of thermodynamics relation of the form $T \delta
S = \delta E$ where $\delta E$ is the difference in the energies corresponding to the reduced density
matrix and the background Davies-Unruh bath. The implications are discussed.
