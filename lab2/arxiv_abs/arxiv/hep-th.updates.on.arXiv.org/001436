We explore the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for the $tmf^\bullet[\frac12]$-cohomology
of the classifying space $BM_{24}$ of the largest Mathieu group $M_{24}$, twisted by a class $\omega
\in H^4(BM_{24};Z[\frac12]) \cong Z_3$. Our exploration includes detailed computations of the
$Z_3$-cohomology of $M_{24}$ and of the first few differentials in the AHSS. We are specifically
interested in the value of $tmf^\bullet_\omega(BM_{24})[\frac12]$ in cohomological degree
$-27$. Our main computational result is that $tmf^{-27}_\omega(BM_{24})[\frac12] = 0$ when $\omega
\neq 0$. For comparison, the restriction map $tmf^{-3}_\omega(BM_{24})[\frac12]\to tmf^{-3}(pt)[\frac12]
\cong Z_3$ is nonzero for one of the two nonzero values of $\omega$. Our motivation comes from Mathieu
Moonshine. Assuming a well-studied conjectural relationship between $TMF$ and supersymmetric
quantum field theory, there is a canonically-defined $Co_1$-twisted-equivariant lifting $[\bar{V}^{f\natural}]$
of the class $\{24\Delta\} \in TMF^{-24}(pt)$, where $Co_1$ denotes Conway's largest sporadic
group. We conjecture that the product $[\bar{V}^{f\natural}] \nu$, where $\nu \in TMF^{-3}(pt)$
is the image of the generator of $tmf^{-3}(pt) \cong Z_{24}$, does not vanish $Co_1$-equivariantly,
but that its restriction to $M_{24}$-twisted-equivariant $TMF$ does vanish. This conjecture
answers some of the questions in Mathieu Moonshine: it implies the existence of a minimally supersymmetric
quantum field theory with $M_{24}$ symmetry, whose twisted-and-twined partition functions have
the same mock modularity as in Mathieu Moonshine. Our AHSS calculation establishes this conjecture
"perturbatively" at odd primes. An appendix included mostly for entertainment purposes discusses
"$\ell$-complexes" and their relation to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Verlinde rings. The case $\ell=3$
is used in our AHSS calculations.
