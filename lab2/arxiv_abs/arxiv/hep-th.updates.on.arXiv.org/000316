We analyze relevant signals expected at the LHC for a left sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP). The discussion is carried out in the `$\mu$ from $\nu$' supersymmetric standard
model ($\mu \nu$SSM), where the presence of $R$-parity breaking couplings involving right-handed
neutrinos solves the $\mu$ problem and reproduces neutrino data. We focus our discussion on the
pair production channels and decays of the left sneutrino LSP. There are two dominant channels,
direct production via a $Z$ boson, or production via a $W^{\pm}$ decaying into a left sneutrino and
a left slepton next-to-LSP (NLSP), with the latter decaying into another left sneutrino plus a very
soft $W^{\pm}$ subproduct. From the decay of a pair of left sneutrinos LSPs of any family, a diphoton
signal plus missing transverse energy (MET) from neutrinos can be present. In addition, in the case
of a pair of tau left sneutrinos LSPs, given the large value of the tau Yukawa coupling, diphoton plus
leptons and/or multileptons can appear. We find that the number of expected events for the multilepton
signal with 13 TeV center-of-mass energy, together with properly adopted search strategies, is
sufficient to give a significant evidence for a tau left sneutrino of mass in the range $130-310$
GeV, even with the integrated luminosity of 20 fb$^{-1}$. In the case of the signal producing diphoton
plus leptons, an integrated luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$ is needed to give a significant evidence
in the mass range of the tau left sneutrino of about $95-145$ GeV. For left sneutrinos of any family
producing a significant diphoton plus MET signal, the mass range is $118-132$ GeV. Finally, we discuss
briefly the presence of displaced vertices and the associated range of masses.
