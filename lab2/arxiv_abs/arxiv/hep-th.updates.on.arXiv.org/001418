We consider discrete random fractal surfaces with negative Hurst exponent $H<0$. A random colouring
of the lattice is provided by activating the sites at which the surface height is greater than a given
level $h$. The set of activated sites is usually denoted as the excursion set. The connected components
of this set, the level clusters, define a one-parameter ($H$) family of percolation models with
long-range correlation in the site occupation. The level clusters percolate at a finite value $h=h_c$
and for $H\leq-\frac{3}{4}$ the phase transition is expected to remain in the same universality
class of the pure (i.e. uncorrelated) percolation. For $-\frac{3}{4}<H< 0$ instead, there is a
line of critical points with continously varying exponents. The universality class of these points,
in particular concerning the conformal invariance of the level clusters, is poorly understood.
By combining the Conformal Field Theory and the numerical approach, we provide new insights on these
phases. We focus on the connectivity function, defined as the probability that two sites belong
to the same level cluster. In our simulations, the surfaces are defined on a lattice torus of size
$M\times N$. We show that the topological effects on the connectivity function make manifest the
conformal invariance for all the critical line $H<0$. In particular, exploiting the anisotropy
of the rectangular torus ($M\neq N$), we directly test the presence of the two components of the traceless
stress-energy tensor. Moreover, we probe the spectrum and the structure constants of the underlying
Conformal Field Theory. Finally, we observed that the corrections to the scaling clearly point
out a breaking of integrability moving from the pure percolation point to the long-range correlated
one.
