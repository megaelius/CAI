It is well-known that chiral anomaly can be detected through energy transport, due to the chiral
magnetic effect. On the other hand, the chaotic modes in a many body system are only associated with
energy conservation. So, this suggests that, perhaps, one can detect the microscopic anomalies
through the quantum chaos in such systems. To holographically investigate this idea, we consider
a magnetized brane in AdS space time with a Chern-Simons coupling in the bulk. By studying the shock
wave geometry in this background, we first compute the corresponding butterfly velocities, in
the presence of an external magnetic field $B$, in $\mu\ll T$ and $ B \ll T^2$ limit. We find that the
butterfly propagation in the direction of $B$ has not the same velocity as the one of opposite direction;
the difference is turned out to be as $\Delta v_{\text{B}}=(\log(4)-1)\Delta v_{sound}$ with
$\Delta v_{sound}$ being the difference between velocity of the two sound modes propagating in
the system. Such special form of splitting confirms the idea that chiral anomaly can be macroscopically
manifested via quantum chaos. We then show that the pole-skipping points of energy density Green's
function in the boundary theory coincide precisely with the chaos points. This might be regarded
as hydrodynamic origin of quantum chaos in an anomalous system. In addition, by studying the near
horizon dynamics of a scalar field on the above background, we find the spectrum of pole-skipping
points associated with the two-point function of dual boundary operator. We show that the sum of
wavenumbers corresponding to the pole-skipping points at a specific Matsubara frequency follows
from a closed formula. Interestingly, we find that the same information about splitting of butterfly
velocities is encoded in the pole-skipping points with lowest Matsubara frequency, independent
of scaling dimension of dual boundary operator.
