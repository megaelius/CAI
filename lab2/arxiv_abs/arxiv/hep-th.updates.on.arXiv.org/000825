A recent analysis by one of the authors\cite{Perivolaropoulos:2018cgr} has pointed out that Derrick's
theorem can be evaded in curved space. Here we extend that analysis by demonstrating the existence
of a static metastable solution in a wide class of metrics that include a Schwarzschild-Rindler-AntideSitter
spacetime (Grumiller metric) defined as $ds^2= f(r) dt^2 - f(r)^{-1} dr^2 - r^2 (d\theta^2 +\sin^2\theta
d\phi^2)$ with $f(r)=1-\frac{2Gm}{r}+2br-\frac{\Lambda}{3} r^2$ ($\Lambda<0\; b<0$). This
metric emerges generically as a spherically symmetric vacuum solution in a class of scalar-tensor
theories\cite{Grumiller:2010bz} as well as in Weyl conformal gravity\cite{Mannheim:1988dj}.
It also emerges in General Relativity (GR) in the presence of a cosmological constant and a proper
spherically symmetric perfect fluid. We demonstrate that this metric supports a static spherically
symmetric metastable soliton scalar field solution that corresponds to a spherical domain wall.
We derive the static solution numerically and identify a range of parameters $m, b, \Lambda$ of the
metric for which the spherical wall is metastable. Our result is supported by both a minimization
of the scalar field energy functional with proper boundary conditions and by a numerical simulation
of the scalar field evolution. The metastable solution is very well approximated as $\phi(r) = Tanh\left[q
(r-r_0)\right]$ where $r_0$ is the radius of the metastable wall that depends on the parameters
of the metric and $q$ determines the width of the wall. We also find the gravitational effects of the
thin spherical wall solution and its backreaction on the background metric that allows its formation.
We show that this backreaction does not hinder the metastability of the solution even though it can
change the range of parameters that correspond to metastability.
