We derive the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations by exploiting the (anti-)chiral
superfield approach (ACSA) to Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism for the four (3+1)-dimensional
(4D) St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-modified massive Abelian 2-form gauge theory. We perform exactly
similar kind of exercise for the derivation of the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)co-BRST symmetry
transformations, too. In the above derivations, the symmetry invariant restrictions on the superfields
play very important and decisive roles. To prove the sanctity of the above nilpotent symmetries,
we generalize our 4D ordinary theory (defined on the 4D flat Minkowskian spacetime manifold) to
its counterparts (4,1)-dimensional (anti-)chiral super sub-manifolds of the (4,2)-dimensional
supermanifold which is parameterized by the superspace coordinates $Z^{M} = (x^{\mu},\theta,
\bar{\theta} ) $ where $x^\mu ( \mu = 0,1,2,3 )$ are the bosonic coordinates and a pair of Grassmannian
variables $(\theta, \bar{\theta})$ are fermionic: ($\theta^{2} = \bar{\theta^{2}} = 0, \,\,\theta\,\bar{\theta}
+\bar{\theta}\,\theta = 0$) in nature. One of the novel observations of our present endeavor is
the derivation of the Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions from the requirement of the symmetry
invariance of the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities for our theory within the framework
of ACSA to BRST formalism. We also exploit the standard techniques of ACSA to capture the off-shell
nilpotency and absolute anticommutativity of the conserved (anti-)BRST as well as the (anti-)co-BRST
charges. In a subtle manner, the proof of the absolute anticommutativity of the above conserved
charges also implies the existence of the appropriate CF-type restrictions on our theory.
