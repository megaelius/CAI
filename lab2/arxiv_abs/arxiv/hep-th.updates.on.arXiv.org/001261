It is well-known that chiral anomaly can be macroscopically detected through the energy and charge
transport, due to the chiral magnetic effect. On the other hand, in a holographic many body system,
the chaotic modes might be only associated with the energy conservation. This suggests that, perhaps,
one can detect microscopic anomalies through the diagnosis of quantum chaos in such systems. To
investigate this idea, we consider a magnetized brane in AdS space time with a Chern-Simons coupling
in the bulk. By studying the shock wave geometry in this background, we first compute the corresponding
butterfly velocities, in the presence of an external magnetic field $B$, in $\mu\ll T$ and $ B \ll
T^2$ limit. We find that the butterfly propagation in the direction of $B$ has a different velocity
than in the opposite direction. The splitting of butterfly velocities confirms the idea that chiral
anomaly can be macroscopically manifested via quantum chaos. We then show that the pole-skipping
points of energy density Green's function of the boundary theory coincide precisely with the chaos
points. This might be regarded as the hydrodynamic origin of quantum chaos in an anomalous system.
Additionally, by studying the near horizon dynamics of a scalar field on the above background, we
find the spectrum of pole-skipping points associated with the two-point function of dual boundary
operator. We find that the sum of wavenumbers corresponding to pole-skipping points at a specific
Matsubara frequency is a universal quantity, which is independent of the scaling dimension of the
dual boundary operator. We then show that this quantity follows from a closed formula and can be regarded
as another macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly.
