Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a unique tool for learning
about the early phases of cosmic history, reaching deep into the primordial Universe. At redshifts
$z<10^6$, thermalization processes become inefficient and existing limits from COBE/FIRAS imply
that no more than $\Delta \rho/\rho<6\times 10^{-5}$ (95% c.l.) of energy could have been injected
into the CMB. However, at higher redshifts, when thermalization is efficient, the constraint weakens
and $\Delta \rho/\rho \simeq 0.01-0.1$ could in principle have occurred. Existing computations
for the evolution of distortions commonly assume $\Delta \rho/\rho \ll 1$ and thus become inaccurate
in this case. Similarly, relativistic temperature corrections become relevant for large energy
release, but have previously not been modeled as carefully. Here we study the evolution of distortions
and the thermalization process after single large energy release at $z>10^5$. We show that for large
distortions the thermalization efficiency is significantly reduced and that the distortion visibility
is sizeable to much earlier times. This tightens spectral distortions constraints on low-mass
primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} < 6\times 10^{11}$ g. Similarly, distortion limits
on the amplitude of the small-scale curvature power spectrum at wavenumbers $k>10^4\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
and short-lived decaying particles with lifetimes $t_X< 10^7$ s are tightened, however, these
still require a more detailed time-dependent treatment. We also briefly discuss the constraints
from measurements of the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and light element
abundances and how these complement spectral distortion limits.
