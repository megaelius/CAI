Recently, Duncan and Mack-Crane established an isomorphism, as Virasoro modules at central charges
c=12, between the space of states of the Conway Moonshine Module and the space of states of a special
K3 theory that was extensively studied some time ago by Gaberdiel, Volpato and the two authors. In
the present work, we lift this result to the level of modules of the extensions of these Virasoro algebras
to N=4 super Virasoro algebras. Moreover, we relate the super vertex operator algebra and module
structure of the Conway Moonshine Module to the operator product expansion of this special K3 theory
by a procedure we call reflection. This procedure can be applied to certain superconformal field
theories, transforming all fields to holomorphic ones. It also allows to describe certain superconformal
field theories within the language of super vertex operator algebras. We discuss reflection and
its limitations in general, and we argue that through reflection, the Conway Moonshine Module inherits
from the K3 theory a richer structure than anticipated so far. The comparison between the Conway
Moonshine Module and the K3 theory is considerably facilitated by exploiting the free fermion description
as well as the lattice vertex operator algebra description of both theories. We include an explicit
construction of cocycles for the relevant charge lattices, which are half integral. The transition
from the K3 theory to the Conway Moonshine Module via reflection promotes the latter to the role of
a medium that collects the symmetries of K3 theories from distinct points of the moduli space, thus
uncovering a version of symmetry surfing in this context.
