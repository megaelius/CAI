Quantum systems are viewed as emergent systems from the fundamental degrees of freedom. The laws
and rules of quantum mechanics are understood as an effective description, valid for the emergent
systems and specially useful to handle probabilistic predictions of observables. After introducing
the geometric theory of Hamilton-Randers spaces and reformulating it using Hilbert space theory,
a Hilbert space structure is constructed from the Hilbert space formulation of the underlying Hamilton-Randers
model and associated with the space of wave functions of quantum mechanical systems. We can prove
the emergence of the Born rule from ergodic considerations. A geometric mechanism for a natural
spontaneous collapse of the quantum states based on the concentration of measure phenomena as it
appears in metric geometry is discussed.We show the existence of stable vacua states for the quantized
matter Hamiltonian. Another consequence of the concentration of measure is the emergence of a weak
equivalence principle for one of the dynamics of the fundamental degrees of freedom. We suggest
that the reduction of the quantum state is driven by a gravitational type interaction. Such interaction
appears only in the dynamical domain when localization of quantum observables happens, it must
be a classical interaction. We discuss the double slit experiment in the context of the framework
proposed, the interference phenomena associated with a quantum system in an external gravitational
potential, a mechanism explaining non-quantum locality and also provide an argument in favour
of an emergent interpretation of every macroscopic time parameter. Entanglement is partially
described in the context of Hamilton-Randers theory and how naturally Bell's inequalities should
be violated.
