In this thesis, we investigate hidden symmetries for the Maldacena-Wilson loop in N=4 super Yang-Mills
theory, mainly focusing on its strong-coupling description as a minimal surface in $AdS_5$. In
the discussion of the symmetry structure of the underlying string model, we highlight the role of
the master symmetry which can be employed to construct all symmetries of the model. The algebra of
these symmetries is worked out. For the concrete case of minimal surfaces in $AdS_5$, we discuss
the deformation of the four-cusp solution, which provides the dual description of the four-gluon
scattering amplitude. This marks the first step toward transferring the master symmetry to scattering
amplitudes. Moreover, we compute the master and Yangian symmetry variations of generic, smooth
boundary curves. The discussion clarifies why previous attempts to transfer the deformations
of minimal surfaces in $AdS_3$ to weak coupling were unsuccessful. We discuss several attempts
to transfer the Yangian symmetry to weak or arbitrary coupling, but ultimately conclude that a Yangian
symmetry of the Maldacena-Wilson loop seems not to be present. This is different for the natural
supersymmetric generalizations of the Maldacena--Wilson loop, Wilson loops in superspace. Their
one-loop expectation value is known to be Yangian invariant. We discuss the strong-coupling counterpart
of this finding by considering minimal surfaces in the superspace of type IIB superstring theory
in $AdS_5 \times S^5$. The comparison of the strong-coupling invariance derived here with the weak-coupling
generators shows that the local term must depend on the coupling in a non-trivial way. Additionally,
we show that the higher-level recurrences of the hypercharge generator, the so-called bonus symmetries,
are present in all higher levels of the Yangian.
