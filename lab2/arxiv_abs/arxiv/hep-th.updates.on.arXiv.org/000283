In quantum gravity perturbation theory in Newton's constant G is known to be badly divergent, and
as a result not very useful. Nevertheless some of the most interesting phenomena in physics are often
associated with non-analytic behavior in the coupling constant and the existence of nontrivial
quantum condensates. It is therefore possible that pathologies encountered in the case of gravity
are more likely the result of inadequate analytical treatment, and not necessarily a reflection
of some intrinsic insurmountable problem. The nonperturbative treatment of quantum gravity via
the Regge-Wheeler lattice path integral formulation reveals the existence of a new phase involving
a nontrivial gravitational vacuum condensate, and a new set of scaling exponents characterizing
both the running of G and the long-distance behavior of invariant correlation functions. The appearance
of such a gravitational condensate is viewed as analogous to the (equally nonperturbative) gluon
and chiral condensates known to describe the physical vacuum of QCD. The resulting quantum theory
of gravity is highly constrained, and its physical predictions are found to depend only on one adjustable
parameter, a genuinely nonperturbative scale xi in many ways analogous to the scaling violation
parameter Lambda MSbar of QCD. Recent results point to significant deviations from classical gravity
on distance scales approaching the effective infrared cutoff set by the observed cosmological
constant. Such subtle quantum effects are expected to be initially small on current cosmological
scales, but could become detectable in future high precision satellite experiments.
