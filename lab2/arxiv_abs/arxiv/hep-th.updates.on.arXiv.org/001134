In this dissertation, we present work towards characterizing various conformal and nearly conformal
quantum field theories nonperturbatively using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques.
A key area of interest is the conformal window of four dimensional gauge theories with Dirac fermions
and its potential applicability to beyond the standard model physics. In the first chapter, we review
some of the history of models of composite Higgs scenarios in order to motivate the study of gauge
theories near the conformal window. In the second chapter we review lattice studies of a specific
theory, SU(3) gauge theory with eight flavors of Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation
of the gauge group. We place a particular emphasis on the light flavor-singlet scalar state appearing
in the spectrum of this model and its possible role as a composite Higgs boson. We advocate an approach
to characterizing nearly conformal gauge theories in which lattice calculations are used to identify
the best low energy effective field theory (EFT) description of such nearly conformal gauge theories,
and the lattice and EFT are then used as complementary tools to classify the generic features of the
low energy physics in these theories. We present new results for maximal isospin $\pi\pi \rightarrow
\pi\pi$ scattering on the lattice computed using L\"uscher's finite volume method. This scattering
study is intended to provide further data for constraining the possible EFT descriptions of nearly
conformal gauge theory. In Chapter 3, we review the historical development of chiral effective
theory from current algebra methods up through the chiral Lagrangian and modern effective field
theory techniques. We present a new EFT framework based on the linear sigma model for describing
the low lying states of nearly conformal gauge theories. We place a ... (full abstract within)
