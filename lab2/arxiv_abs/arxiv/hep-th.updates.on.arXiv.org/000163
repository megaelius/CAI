We give a general procedure, in the group field theory (GFT) formalism for quantum gravity, for constructing
states that describe macroscopic, spatially homogeneous universes. These states are close to
coherent (condensate) states used in the description of Bose-Einstein condensates. The condition
on such states to be (approximate) solutions to the quantum equations of motion of GFT is used to extract
an effective dynamics for homogeneous cosmologies directly from the underlying quantum theory.
The resulting description in general gives nonlinear and nonlocal equations for the 'condensate
wavefunction' which are analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in Bose-Einstein condensates.
We show the general form of the effective equations for current quantum gravity models, as well as
some concrete examples. We identify conditions under which the dynamics becomes linear, admitting
an interpretation as a quantum-cosmological Wheeler-DeWitt equation, and give its semiclassical
(WKB) approximation in the case of a kinetic term that includes a Laplace-Beltrami operator. For
isotropic states, this approximation reproduces the classical Friedmann equation in vacuum with
positive spatial curvature. We show how the formalism can be consistently extended from Riemannian
signature to Lorentzian signature models, and discuss the addition of matter fields, obtaining
the correct coupling of a massless scalar in the Friedmann equation from the most natural extension
of the GFT action. We also outline the procedure for extending our condensate states to include cosmological
perturbations. Our results form the basis of a general programme for extracting effective cosmological
dynamics directly from a microscopic non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity.
