A covariant description of quantum matter fields in the early universe underpins models for the
origin of species, e.g. baryogenesis and dark matter production. In nearly all cases the relevant
cosmological observables are computed in a general approximation, via the standard irreducible
representations found in the operator formalism of particle physics, where intricacies related
to a renormalized stress-energy tensor in a nonstationary spacetime are ignored. Models of the
early universe also include a dense environment of quantum fields where far-from-equilibrium
interactions manifest expressions for observables with substantive corrections to the leading
terms. A more rigorous treatment of these cosmological observables may be carried out within the
alternative framework of algebraic quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the field theoretic
model of quantum matter is compatible with the classical effects of general relativity. Here, we
take the first step towards computing such an observable. We employ the algebraic formalism while
considering far-from-equilibrium interactions in a dense environment under the influence of
a classical, yet nonstationary, spacetime to derive an expression for the time-dependent energy
density as a component of the renormalized stress-energy tensor associated with common proposals
for quantum matter production in the early universe. We derive the analogous expression in the standard
operator formalism and show that the results, presented here for the first time, reduce to those
of the standard approach to nonequilibrium quantum field theory in the stationary spacetime limit.
