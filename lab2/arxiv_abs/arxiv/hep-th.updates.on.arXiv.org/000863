We present the detailed derivation of the longitudinal part of the three-gluon vertex from the Slavnov-Taylor
identities that it satisfies, by means of a nonperturbative implementation of the Ball-Chiu construction;
the latter, in its original form, involves the inverse gluon propagator, the ghost dressing function,
and certain form factors of the ghost-gluon kernel. The main conceptual subtlety that renders this
endeavor nontrivial is the infrared finiteness of the gluon propagator, and the resulting need
to separate the vertex into two pieces, one that is intimately connected with the emergence of a gluonic
mass scale, and one that satisfies the original set of Slavnov-Taylor identities, but with the inverse
gluon propagator replaced by its "kinetic" term. The longitudinal form factors obtained by this
construction are presented for arbitrary Euclidean momenta, as well as special kinematic configurations,
parametrized by a single momentum. A particularly preeminent feature of the components comprising
the tree-level vertex is their considerable suppression for momenta below 1 GeV, and the appearance
of the characteristic "zero-crossing" in the vicinity of 100-200 MeV. Special combinations of
the form factors derived with this method are compared with the results of recent large-volume lattice
simulations as well as Schwinger-Dyson equations, and good overall agreement is found. A variety
of issues related to the distribution of the pole terms responsible for the gluon mass generation
are discussed in detail, and their impact on the structure of the transverse parts is elucidated.
In addition, a brief account of several theoretical and phenomenological possibilities involving
these newly acquired results is presented.
