The most momentous requirement a quantum theory of gravity must satisfy is Background Independence,
necessitating in particular an ab initio derivation of the arena all non-gravitational physics
takes place in, namely spacetime. Using the background field technique, this requirement translates
into the condition of an unbroken split-symmetry connecting the (quantized) metric fluctuations
to the (classical) background metric. If the regularization scheme used violates split-symmetry
during the quantization process it is mandatory to restore it in the end at the level of observable
physics. In this paper we present a detailed investigation of split-symmetry breaking and restoration
within the Effective Average Action (EAA) approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) with a special
emphasis on the Asymptotic Safety conjecture. In particular we demonstrate for the first time in
a non-trivial setting that the two key requirements of Background Independence and Asymptotic
Safety can be satisfied simultaneously. Carefully disentangling fluctuation and background
fields, we employ a `bi-metric' ansatz for the EAA and project the flow generated by its functional
renormalization group equation on a truncated theory space spanned by two separate Einstein-Hilbert
actions for the dynamical and the background metric, respectively. A new powerful method is used
to derive the corresponding renormalization group (RG) equations for the Newton- and cosmological
constant, both in the dynamical and the background sector. We classify and analyze their solutions
in detail, determine their fixed point structure, and identify an attractor mechanism which turns
out instrumental in the split-symmetry restoration. We show that there exists a subset of RG trajectories
which are both asymptotically safe and split-symmetry restoring. We conclude that the next generation
of truncations must be bi-metric.
