The Petrov classification is an important algebraic classification for the Weyl tensor valid in
4-dimensional space-times. In this thesis such classification is generalized to manifolds of
arbitrary dimension and signature. This is accomplished by interpreting the Weyl tensor as a linear
operator on the bundle of p-forms, for any p, and computing the Jordan canonical form of this operator.
Throughout this work the spaces are assumed to be complexified, so that different signatures correspond
to different reality conditions, providing a unified treatment. A higher-dimensional generalization
of the so-called self-dual manifolds is also investigated. The most important result related to
the Petrov classification is the Goldberg-Sachs theorem. Here are presented two partial generalizations
of such theorem valid in even-dimensional manifolds. One of these generalizations states that
certain algebraic constraints on the Weyl operator imply the existence of an integrable maximally
isotropic distribution. The other version of the generalized Goldberg-Sachs theorem states that
these algebraic constraints imply the existence of a null congruence whose optical scalars obey
special restrictions. On the pursuit of these results the spinorial formalism in 6 dimensions was
developed from the very beginning, using group representation theory. Since the spinors are full
of geometric significance and are suitable tools to deal with isotropic structures, it should not
come as a surprise that they provide a fruitful framework to investigate the issues treated on this
thesis. In particular, the generalizations of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem acquire an elegant form
in terms of the pure spinors.
