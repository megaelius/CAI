The earlier treatments of Lorentz covariant harmonic oscillator have brought to light various
difficulties, such as reconciling Lorentz symmetry with the full Fock space, and divergence issues
with their functional representations. We present here a full solution avoiding those problems.
The complete set of Fock states is obtained, together with the corresponding explicit wavefunction
and their inner product integrals free from any divergence problem and the Lorentz symmetry fully
maintained without additional constraints imposed. By a simple choice of the pseudo-unitary representation
of the underlying symmetry group, motivated from the perspective of the Minkowski spacetime as
a representation for the Lorentz group, we obtain the natural non-unitary Fock space picture commonly
considered though not formulated and presented in the careful details given here. From a direct
derivation of the appropriate basis state wavefunctions of the finite-dimensional irreducible
representations of the Lorentz symmetry, the relation between the latter and the Fock state wavefunctions
is also explicitly shown. Moreover, the full picture including the states with non-positive norm
may give consistent physics picture as a version of Lorentz covariant quantum mechanics. Probability
interpretation for the usual von Neumann measurements is not a problem as all wavefunctions restricted
to a definite value for the `time' variable are just like those of the usual time independent quantum
mechanics. A further understanding from a perspective of the dynamics from the symplectic geometry
of the phase space is shortly discussed.
