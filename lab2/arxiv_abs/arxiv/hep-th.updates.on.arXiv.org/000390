The detection by Advanced LIGO/VIRGO of black hole mergers with large progenitor masses ranging
up to 30 $M_\odot$ and one progenitor spin likely to be non-aligned with the orbital momentum, point
towards a possible primordial (non-stellar) origin of these black holes. If they are primordial
black holes (PBH), the merger rates inferred by LIGO coincide with the ones expected for abundances
comparable to those of Dark Matter (DM). By re-investigating some observations, such as microlensing
and compact star clusters in faint dwarf galaxies, and by analyzing the latest LIGO data, we identify
seven hints pointing towards PBH-DM, with a broad mass spectrum centered in the range $[1-10] M_\odot$.
The detection of numerous micro-lensing events of distant quasars and stars in M31 provide firm
evidences that 15%-25% of the halo of massive galaxies is made of compact objects with masses $[0.05-0.45]
M_\odot$ and $[0.5-1] M_\odot$ respectively, such as a primordial black holes. These values are
compatible with the re-constructed PBH mass spectrum from LIGO events. Altogether, for a log-normal
distribution, we find best fit values for the central mass $\mu \approx 3 M_\odot$ and a width $ \sigma
\approx 0.5 $. On the other hand, this scenario passes all the other current constraints on PBH abundances.
Moreover, we show by using first physical principles that it would naturally explain the missing
dwarf satellites, too-big-to-fail, core/cusp and missing baryon problems as well as the observation
of super-massive black holes at high redshifts that would have grown from primordial seeds in the
tail of the PBH mass distribution. In this scenario, between 0.1% and 1% of the events detected by
LIGO will involve a PBH with a mass below the Chandrasekhar mass, which would unambiguously prove
the existence of PBH.
