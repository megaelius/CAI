Defining a Chiral Fermion Theory on a lattice has presented an ongoing challenge both in Condensed
Matter physics and in Lattice Gauge Theory. In this paper, we demonstrate that a chiral free-fermion
theory can live on an ultra-local spacetime lattice if we allow the Lagrangian to be non-hermitian.
Rather than a violation of unitarity, the non-hermitian structure of our Lagrangian arises because
time is discrete, and we show that our model is obeys an elementary unitarity condition: namely,
that the norm of the two-point functions conserves probability. Beyond unitarity, our model displays
several surprising properties: it is formulated directly in Minkowskian time; it has exactly Lorentz
invariant dynamics for all frequencies and momenta (in the large volume limit); and it is free from
all gauge anomalies, despite the prediction from field theory that it should suffer one. We show
that our model is a discrete time description of a single chiral edge mode of several recently proposed
$2+1$d Floquet models. That the chiral edge can be treated without the rest of the $2+1$d system,
even when coupled to a gauge field, implies that the Floquet models are radically different from
Integer Quantum Hall models, which also support chiral edge modes. Furthermore, the Floquet results
imply that our model can be physically realized, which presents an opportunity for gauge theories
to be simulated in a condensed matter or cold atom context. Our results present a solution to the `Chiral-fermion
problem:' a chiral field theory can indeed be defined on an ultra-local spacetime lattice, and we
address how our model avoids several no-go arguments.
