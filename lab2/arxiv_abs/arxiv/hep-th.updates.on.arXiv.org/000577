In the context of Horava gravity, the most promising known scenarios to recover Lorentz invariance
at low energy are the possibilities that (1) the renormalization group flow of the system leads to
emergent infrared Lorentz invariance, and (2) that supersymmetry protects infrared Lorentz invariance.
A third scenario proposes that a classically Lorentz invariant matter sector with controlled quantum
corrections may simply co-exist with Horava gravity under certain conditions. However, for non-projectable
Horava gravity in 3+1 dimensions it is known that, in the absence of additional structures, this
mechanism is spoiled by unexpected power-law divergences. We confirm this same result in the projectable
version of the theory by employing the recently found gauge-fixing term that renders the shift and
graviton propagators regular. We show that the problem persists for all dimensions $D\geq 3$, and
that the degree of fine tuning in squared sound speeds between a U(1) gauge field and a scalar field
increases with $D$. In particular, this difference in the zero external momentum limit is proportional
to $\Lambda^{D-1}$ for $D\geq 3$, where $\Lambda$ is the ultraviolet momentum cutoff for loop integrals,
while the power-law divergences are absent for $D=1$ and $D=2$. These results suggest that not only
the gravity sector but also the matter sector should exhibit a transition to Lifshitz scaling above
some scale, and that there should not be a large separation between the transition scales in the gravity
and matter sectors. We close with a discussion of other more promising scenarios, including emergent
Lorentz invariance from supersymmetry/strong dynamics, and pointing out challenges where they
exist.
