Superconformal field theories (SCFT) are known to possess solvable yet nontrivial sectors in their
full operator algebras. Two prime examples are the chiral algebra sector on a two dimensional plane
in four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs, and the topological quantum mechanics (TQM) sector
on a line in three dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs. Under Weyl transformation, they respectively
map to operator algebras on a great torus in $S^1\times S^3$ and a great circle in $S^3$, and are naturally
related by reduction along the $S^1$ factor, which amounts to taking the Cardy (high-temperature)
limit of the four dimensional theory on $S^1\times S^3$. We elaborate on this relation by explicit
examples that involve both Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian theories in four dimensions, where the
chiral algebra sector is generally described by a certain W-algebra, while the three dimensional
descendant SCFT always has a (mirror) Lagrangian description. By taking into account a subtle R-symmetry
mixing, we provide explicit dictionaries between selected operator product expansion (OPE) data
in the four and three dimensional SCFTs, which we verify in the examples using recent localization
results in four and three dimensions. Our methods thus provide nontrivial support for various chiral
algebra proposals in the literature. Along the way, we also identify previously unknown three dimensional
(mirror) theories from Argyres-Douglas theories of types $(A_1, A_{2n-2})$ and $(A_1, D_{2n+1})$
reduced on $S^1$, which realize certain superconformal boundary conditions for the four dimensional
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills. This is a companion paper to arXiv:1911.05741.
