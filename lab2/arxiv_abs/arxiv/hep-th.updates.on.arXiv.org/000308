We investigate the matter creation processes during the reheating period at the end of inflation
in the early Universe, by using the irreversible thermodynamic of open systems. The matter content
of the Universe is assumed to consist of the inflationary scalar field, which, through its decay,
generates relativistic matter, and pressureless dark matter, respectively. At the early stages
of reheating the inflationary scalar field transfers its energy to the newly created matter particles,
with the field energy decreasing to near zero. The general equations governing the irreversible
matter creation during reheating are obtained by combining the thermodynamics description of
the matter creation and the gravitational field equations. A dimensionless form of the general
system of the reheating equations is also introduced. The role of the different inflationary scalar
field potentials is analyzed by using analytical and numerical methods, and the evolution of the
matter and scalar field densities, as well as of the cosmological parameters during reheating,
are obtained. Typically, the values of the energy densities of relativistic matter and dark matter
reach their maximum when the Universe is reheated up to the reheating temperature, which is determined
for each case, as a function of the scalar field decay width, the scalar field particle mass, and of
the cosmological parameters. An interesting result is that particle production leads to the acceleration
of the Universe during the reheating phase, with the deceleration parameter showing a complex dynamics.
Once the energy density of the scalar field becomes negligible with respect to the matter densities,
the expansion of the Universe decelerates, and inflation has a graceful exit after reheating.
