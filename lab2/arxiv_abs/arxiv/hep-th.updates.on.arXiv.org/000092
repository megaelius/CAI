Selection of physically meaningful solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the wavefunction
in quantum cosmology, can be attained by a reduction of the theory to the sector of true physical degrees
of freedom and their canonical quantization. The resulting physical wavefunction unitarily evolving
in the time variable introduced within this reduction can then be raised to the level of the cosmological
wavefunction in superspace of 3-metrics. We apply this technique in several simple minisuperspace
models and discuss both at classical and quantum level physical reduction in {\em extrinsic} time
-- the time variable determined in terms of extrinsic curvature. Only this extrinsic time gauge
can be consistently used in vicinity of turning points and bounces where the scale factor reaches
extremum. Since the 3-metric scale factor is canonically dual to extrinsic time variable, the transition
from the physical wavefunction to the wavefunction in superspace represents a kind of the generalized
Fourier transform. This transformation selects square integrable solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation, which guarantee Hermiticity of canonical operators of the Dirac quantization scheme.
Semiclassically this means that wavefunctions are represented by oscillating waves in classically
allowed domains of superspace and exponentially fall off in classically forbidden (underbarrier)
regions. This is explicitly demonstrated in flat FRW model with a scalar field having a constant
negative potential and for the case of phantom scalar field with a positive potential. The FRW model
of a scalar field with a vanishing potential does not lead to selection rules for solutions of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation, but this does not violate Hermiticity properties, because all these
solutions are anyway of plane wave type and describe cosmological dynamics without turning points
and bounces.
