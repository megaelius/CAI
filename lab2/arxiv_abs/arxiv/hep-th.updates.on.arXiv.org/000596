The purpose of the current article is to present a brief albeit accurate presentation of the main
tools used in the study of symmetries of Lagrange equations for holonomic systems and subsequently
to show how these tools are applied in the major models of modern cosmology in order to derive exact
solutions and deal with the problem of dark matter/energy. The key role in this approach are the first
integrals of the field equations. We start with the Lie point symmetries and the first integrals
defined by them, that is the Hojman integrals. Subsequently we discuss the Noether point symmetries
and the well known method for deriving the Noether integrals. By means of the Inverse Noether Theorem
we show that to every Hojman quadratic first integral one is possible to associate a Noether symmetry
whose Noether integral is the original Hojman integral. It is emphasized that the point transformation
generating this Noether symmetry need not coincide with the point transformation defining the
Lie symmetry which produces the Hojman integral. We discuss the close connection between the Lie
point and the Noether point symmetries with the collineations of the metric defined by the kinetic
energy of the Lagrangian. In particular the generators of Noether point symmetries are elements
of the homothetic algebra of that metric. The key point in the current study of cosmological models
is the introduction of the mini superspace, that is the space which is defined by the physical variables
of the model, which is not the spacetime where the model evolves. The metric in the mini superspace
is found from the kinematic part of the Lagrangian and we call it the kinetic metric. The rest part
of the Lagrangian is the effective potential.
