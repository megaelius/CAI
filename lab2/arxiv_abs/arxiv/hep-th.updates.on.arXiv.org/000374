F-theory/heterotic duality is formulated in the stable degeneration limit of a K3 fibration on
the F-theory side. In this note, we analyze the structure of the stable degeneration limit. We discuss
whether stable degeneration exists for pairs of rational elliptic surfaces. We demonstrate that,
when two rational elliptic surfaces have an identical complex structure, stable degeneration
always exists. We provide an equation that systematically describes the stable degeneration of
a K3 surface into a pair of isomorphic rational elliptic surfaces. When two rational elliptic surfaces
have different complex structures, whether their sum glued along a smooth fiber admits deformation
to a K3 surface can be determined by studying the structure of the K3 lattice. We investigate the lattice
theoretic condition to determine whether a deformation to a K3 surface exists for pairs of extremal
rational elliptic surfaces. In addition, we discuss the configurations of singular fibers under
stable degeneration. The sum of two isomorphic rational elliptic surfaces glued together admits
a deformation to a K3 surface, whose singular fibers are twice as many as the singular fibers of the
rational elliptic surface. For special situations, singular fibers of the resulting K3 surface
collide and they are enhanced to a fiber of another type. Some K3 surfaces become attractive for these
situations. We determine the complex structures and the Weierstrass forms of these attractive
K3 surfaces. We also deduce the gauge groups in F-theory compactifications on these attractive
K3 surfaces times a K3. $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$ and $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$ gauge groups arise in these compactifications.
