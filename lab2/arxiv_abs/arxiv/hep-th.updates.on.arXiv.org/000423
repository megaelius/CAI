Based on a previous work handling the 4-particle amplituhedron at 3-loop, we have found an extremely
simple pattern, yet far more non-trivial than one might naturally expect: the all-loop Mondrian
diagrammatics. By further simplifying and rephrasing the key relation of positivity in the amplituhedron
setting, remarkably, we find a completeness relation unifying all diagrams of the Mondrian types
for the 4-particle integrand of planar N=4 SYM to all loop orders, each of which can be mapped to a simple
product following a few plain rules designed for this relation. The explicit examples we investigate
span from 3-loop to 7-loop level, and based on them, we classify the basic patterns of Mondrian diagrams
into four types: the ladder, cross, brick-wall and spiral patterns. Interestingly, for some special
combinations of ordered subspaces (a concept defined in the previous work), we find failed exceptions
of the completeness relation which are called "anomalies", nevertheless, they substantially
give hints on the all-loop recursive proof of this relation. These investigations are closely related
to the combinatoric knowledge of separable permutations and Schroeder numbers, and go even further
from a diagrammatic perspective. For physical relevance, we need to further consider dual conformal
invariance for two basic diagrammatic patterns in order to obtain the correct numerator for an integrand
that involves such patterns, while the denominator encoding its pole structure, and also the sign
factor, are already fixed by rules of the completeness relation. With this extra treatment to ensure
the integrals are dual conformally invariant, Mondrian diagrams can be exactly translated to their
corresponding physical loop integrals, after the summation over all ordered subspaces that admit
each of them.
