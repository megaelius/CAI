Localised sources such as D-branes or orientifold planes play an important role in many string compactifications
that are relevant for phenomenology. The presence of these objects typically induces complicated
dynamics in the compact dimensions such that a full solution to the 10d equations of motion is often
out of reach. In order to still be able to make statements about the 4d effective theory arising in
the low-energy limit, the equations of motion are usually only solved in an integrated sense, while
the backreaction of the localised sources on the internal fields is neglected. This simplification
is often referred to as smearing. In this work, we investigate to what extent smearing may affect
observables in the effective low-energy theory and whether it may lead to fake solutions that would
cease to exist once the backreaction is properly taken into account. We analyse explicit examples
for which smeared solutions exist and find that the reliability of the smeared approximation appears
to depend on whether or not these solutions saturate a BPS bound. We also address the proposal of placing
anti-D3-branes at the tip of a warped throat geometry like the Klebanov-Strassler solution in order
to construct meta-stable de Sitter vacua in string theory. We show that, under a few general assumptions,
the backreaction of the fully localised anti-branes yields a singularity in fields that do not directly
couple to them, and we give an argument suggesting that the singularity is not resolved by brane polarisation.
We furthermore demonstrate that, in many string compactifications involving non-trivial background
fluxes, the effective lower-dimensional cosmological constant is determined by the on-shell
action of the localised sources present in the solution. This often allows to compute the cosmological
constant without resorting to potentially unreliable approximations like smearing.
