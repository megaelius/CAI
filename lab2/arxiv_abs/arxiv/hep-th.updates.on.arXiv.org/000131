We discuss here a specific field-theory model, inspired from string theory, in which the generation
of a matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Cosmos is due to the propagation of fermions in a non-trivial,
spherically asymmetric (and hence Lorentz violating) gravitational background that may characterise
the epochs of the early universe. The background induces different dispersion relations, hence
populations, between fermions and antifermions, and thus CPT Violation (CPTV) already in thermal
equilibrium. Species populations may freeze out leading to leptogenesis and baryogenesis. More
specifically, after reviewing some generic models of background-induced CPTV in early epochs
of the Universe, we consider a string-inspired scenario, in which the CPTV is associated with a cosmological
background with torsion provided by the Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymemtric tensor field of the string
gravitational multiplet. In a four-dimensional space time this field is dual to a pseudoscalar
``axion-like'' field. The thermalising processes in this model are (right-handed) Majorana neutrino-antineutrino
oscillations, which are induced in the presence of the KR axion background. These processes freeze
out at a (high) temperature $T_c >> m$, where $m$ is the Majorana neutrino mass, at which the
KR background goes to zero or is diminished significantly, through appropriate phase transitions
of the (string) universe. An additional, but equally important, r\^ole, of the KR field is that its
quantum fluctuations and mixing with an ordinary axion, which couples to the Majorana neutrinos
via appropriate Yukawa couplings, can also lead to the generation of a Majorana neutrino mass through
quantum anomalies. This provides a novel way for generating neutrino masses, independent of the
traditional seesaw mechanism.
