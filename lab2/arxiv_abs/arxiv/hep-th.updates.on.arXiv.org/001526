A revised, consistent, pedagogical approach to studying the motion of heavy and light probe quarks
in a thermal plasma using the AdS/CFT correspondence is explored. Two cases are considered: external
heavy or light quarks undergoing Brownian motion in the plasma, and an external heavy quark moving
through the field theory plasma with a constant velocity. In the bulk theory, the dual description
of these probe quarks are realised as test strings in an asymptotically anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild
background. An on-mass-shell, external heavy quark is modelled as an open string attached at the
AdS boundary and hanging towards the horizon. In juxtaposition, an off-mass-shell, external light
quark is modelled as an open string, initially stretched between the AdS boundary and just above
the horizon, whose AdS boundary endpoint is released to fall at the local speed of light. In both cases,
the Schwarzschild black hole excites the modes on the string -- resulting in the string's boundary
(stationary or falling) endpoint enduring irregular motion. This corresponds respectively to
the heavy or light probe quark in the gauge theory undergoing Brownian motion. For both cases, the
mean-squared transverse displacement of the string's boundary endpoint, $s^2(t;d)$ (equivalent
to the mean-squared displacement travelled by the external quark in the thermal plasma) is computed.
In the early time limit, the behaviour is found to be ballistic $s^2(t;d) \sim t^2$, while the late
time dynamics are diffusive $s^2(t;d) = 2 D(d)\, t$. The diffusion coefficient $D(d)$ is extricated
for both the heavy and light quark's test strings; first in AdS$_3$-Schwarzschild and then generalised
to AdS$_d$-Schwarzschild.
