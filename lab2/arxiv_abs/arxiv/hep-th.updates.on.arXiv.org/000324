We argue that classical spacetimes represent amplified information in the holographic theory
of quantum gravity. In general, classicalization of a quantum system involves amplification of
information at the cost of exponentially reducing the number of observables. In quantum gravity,
the geometry of spacetime must be the analogously amplified information. Bulk local semiclassical
operators probe this information without disturbing it; these correspond to logical operators
acting on code subspaces of the holographic theory. From this viewpoint, we study how bulk local
operators may be realized in a holographic theory of general spacetimes, which includes AdS/CFT
as a special case, and deduce its consequences. In the first half of the paper, we ask what description
of the bulk physics is provided by a holographic state dual to a semiclassical spacetime. In particular,
we analyze what portion of the bulk can be reconstructed as spacetime in the holographic theory.
The analysis indicates that when a spacetime contains a quasi-static black hole inside a holographic
screen, the theory provides a description of physics as viewed from the exterior (though the interior
information is not absent). In the second half, we study how and when a semiclassical description
emerges in the holographic theory. We find that states representing semiclassical spacetimes
are non-generic in the holographic Hilbert space. If there are a significant number of independent
microstates, semiclassical operators must be given state-dependently; we elucidate this point
using the stabilizer formalism and tensor network models. We also discuss possible implications
of the present picture for the black hole interior.
