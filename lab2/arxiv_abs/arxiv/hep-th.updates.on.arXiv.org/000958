Effective Field Theory technique is one of the most elegant ways to capture the impact of high scale
theory, if any, at some low energy by incorporating higher mass dimensional ($\geq 5$) effective
operators ($\mathcal{O}_i$). The low energy EFT is described in terms of only light degrees of freedom
which can appear on-shell. An essential task while developing the EFT framework is to compute these
$\mathcal{O}_i$'s. Hilbert Series is a novel and mathematically robust method to construct the
complete set of gauge invariant independent, effective operators. The HS requires the knowledge
of the transformation properties of the light DOF and the covariant derivatives under the internal
gauge symmetries and conformal groups. The Hilbert Series method, by its virtue, automatically
takes care of the redundancies in the operator set due to the Equations of Motion of fields and Integration
by Parts with impeccable accuracy. In this paper, we have adopted this methodology to construct
the complete set of independent operators up to dimension-6 in the ``Warsaw"-like basis for two
different Beyond Standard Model scenarios -- 2HDM and MLRSM. For both these cases, we have calculated
the corrections to the scalar, gauge boson and fermion mass spectra due to the dimension-6 operators.
The additional contributions to all the Feynman vertices are computed and their impact on different
observables, namely Weak mixing angle, Fermi constant, $\rho$ and oblique parameters. We have
further discussed how the magnetic moments of charged leptons and production and decay of the massive
BSM particles, e.g., charged scalar and different rare processes are affected in the presence of
effective operators. We have also constructed the effective scalar four-point interactions and
commented on the possible reinvestigation of the theoretical constraints, e.g., unitarity and
vacuum stability within these frameworks.
