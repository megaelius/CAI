We apply the statefinder diagnostic to the holographic dark energy models, including the original
holographic dark energy (HDE) model, the new holographic dark energy (NHDE) model, the new agegraphic
dark energy (NADE) model, and the Ricci dark energy (RDE) model. In the low-redshift region the holographic
dark energy models are degenerate with each other and with the $\Lambda$CDM model in the $H(z)$ and
$q(z)$ evolutions. In particular, the HDE model is highly degenerate with the $\Lambda$CDM model,
and in the HDE model the cases with different parameter values are also in the strong degeneracy.
Since the observational data are mainly within the low-redshift region, it is very important to
break this low-redshift degeneracy in the $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ diagnostics by using some quantities
with higher order derivatives of the scale factor. It is shown that the statefinder diagnostic $r(z)$
is very useful in breaking the low-redshift degeneracies. By employing the statefinder diagnostic
the holographic dark energy models can be differentiated efficiently in the low-redshift region.
The degeneracy between the holographic dark energy models and the $\Lambda$CDM model can also be
broken by this method. Especially for the HDE model, all the previous strong degeneracies appearing
in the $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ diagnostics are broken effectively. But for the NADE model, the degeneracy
between the cases with different parameter values cannot be broken, even though the statefinder
diagnostic is used. Direct comparison of the holographic dark energy models in the $r$--$s$ plane
is also made, in which the separations between the models (including the $\Lambda$CDM model) can
be directly measured in the light of the current values $\{r_0, s_0\}$ of the models.
