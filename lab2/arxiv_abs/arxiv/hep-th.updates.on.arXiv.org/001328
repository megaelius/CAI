The purpose of this thesis is to provide insights into different aspects of black hole physics, both
at a quantum level and from an observational point of view. On the one hand, regarding their fundamental
constitutive characteristics, we have followed ideas proposing a bridge between black holes physics
and quantum information. In this approach, these objects can be understood as Bose-Einstein condensates
of weakly interacting gravitons. We have studied the existence of such solutions considered as
bound systems of many constituents, providing well established metrics (Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om).
It should be noted that all solutions found can be interpreted as mean field wave functions of the
condensate and are strongly related to the classical structure of the metric that supports them.
On the other hand, it is well known that the acceleration of very massive bodies produces wave-like
disturbances in spacetime itself. We focus on the low-frequency range which is expected to be measured
by arrays of pulsars employed as galactic clocks (Pulsar Timing Arrays). When waves passes, the
very stable ticks are disturbed. However the existence of a dynamical background, mainly composed
by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, may affect the gravitational wave propagation and would
modify the expected signal over the PTA. We have studied the influence of different backgrounds
composed by relativistic and non-relativistic matter, together with the cosmological constant.
We present a detailed characterization of this effect which at first order depends only on the Hubble
constant $H_0$ (at higher orders different contributions can be disentangled). We also discuss
how and where this effect can be found. We hope that our results contribute to a definitive detection
by PTA. Needless to say, an independent local determination of $H_0$ would be of enormous interest.
