In this work we systematically enumerate genus one fibrations in the class of 7,890 Calabi-Yau manifolds
defined as complete intersections in products of projective spaces, the so-called CICY threefolds.
This survey is independent of the description of the manifolds and improves upon past approaches
that probed only a particular algebraic form of the threefolds (i.e. searches for "obvious" genus
one fibrations as in [1,2]). We also study K3-fibrations and nested fibration structures. That
is, K3 fibrations with potentially many distinct elliptic fibrations. To accomplish this survey
a number of new geometric tools are developed including a determination of the full topology of all
CICY threefolds, including triple intersection numbers. In 2,946 cases this involves finding
a new "favorable" description of the manifold in which all divisors descend from a simple ambient
space. Our results consist of a survey of obvious fibrations for all CICY threefolds and a complete
classification of all genus one fibrations for 4,957 "Kahler favorable" CICYs whose Kahler cones
descend from a simple ambient space. Within the CICY dataset, we find 139,597 obvious genus one fibrations,
30,974 obvious K3 fibrations and 208,987 nested combinations. For the Kahler favorable geometries
we find a complete classification of 377,559 genus one fibrations. For one manifold with Hodge numbers
(19,19) we find an explicit description of an infinite number of distinct genus-one fibrations
extending previous results for this particular geometry that have appeared in the literature.
