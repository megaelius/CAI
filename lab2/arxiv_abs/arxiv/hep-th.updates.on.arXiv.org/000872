We recall a classical theory of torsion gravity with an asymmetric metric, sourced by a Nambu-Goto
+ Kalb-Ramond string . We explain why this is a significant gravitational theory, and in what sense
classical general relativity is an approximation to it. We propose that a non-commutative generalisation
of this theory (in the sense of Connes' non-commutative geometry and Adler's Trace Dynamics) is
a `quantum theory of gravity'. The theory is in fact a classical matrix dynamics with only two fundamental
constants -- the square of the Planck length and the speed of light, along with the two string tensions
as parameters. The guiding symmetry principle is that the theory should be covariant under general
coordinate transformations of non-commuting coordinates.The action for this non-commutative
torsion gravity can be elegantly expressed as an invariant area integral, and represents an atom
of space-time-matter. The statistical thermodynamics of a large number of such atoms yields the
laws of quantum gravity and quantum field theory, at thermodynamic equilibrium. Spontaneous localisation
caused by large fluctuations away from equilibrium is responsible for the emergence of classical
space-time and the field equations of classical general relativity. The resolution of the quantum
measurement problem by spontaneous collapse is an inevitable consequence of this process. Quantum
theory and general relativity, are both seen as emergent phenomena, resulting from coarse-graining
of the underlying non-commutative geometry. We explain the profound role played by entanglement
in this theory: entanglement describes interaction between the atoms of space-time-matter, and
indeed entanglement appears to be more fundamental than quantum theory or space-time. We also comment
on possible implications for black hole entropy and evaporation, and for cosmology.
