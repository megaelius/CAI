The recent gravitational wave observations by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration have allowed the first
tests of General Relativity in the extreme gravity regime, when comparable-mass black holes and
neutron stars collide. Future space-based detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna,
will allow tests of Einstein's theory with gravitational waves emitted when a small black hole falls
into a supermassive one in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral. One particular test that is tailor-made
for such inspirals is the search for chaos in extreme gravity. We here study whether chaos is present
in the motion of test particles around spinning black holes of parity-violating modified gravity,
focusing in particular on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a resummation strategy that
restores all spin terms in the General Relativity limit, while retaining up to fifth-order-in-spin
terms in the dynamical Chern-Simons corrections to the Kerr metric. We then calculate Poincar\'e
surfaces of section and rotation numbers of a wide family of geodesics of this resummed metric. We
find no evidence for geodesic chaos, with at most deformations of the resonant torii that shrink
as terms of higher-order in spin are included in the dynamical Chern-Simons corrections to the Kerr
metric. Our numerical findings suggest that the geodesics of the as-of-yet unknown exact solution
for spinning black holes in this theory may be integrable, and that there may thus exist a fourth integral
of motion associated with this exact solution. The studies presented here begin to lay the foundations
for chaotic tests of General Relativity with the observation of extreme mass ratio inspirals with
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.
