The physical interpretation and eventual fate of gravitational singularities in a theory surpassing
classical general relativity are puzzling questions that have generated a great deal of interest
among various quantum gravity approaches. In the context of loop quantum gravity (LQG), one of the
major candidates for a non-perturbative background-independent quantisation of general relativity,
considerable effort has been devoted to construct effective models in which these questions can
be studied. In these models, classical singularities are replaced by a "bounce" induced by quantum
geometry corrections. Undesirable features may arise however depending on the details of the model.
In this paper, we focus on Schwarzschild black holes and propose a new effective quantum theory based
on polymerisation of new canonical phase space variables inspired by those successful in loop quantum
cosmology. The quantum corrected spacetime resulting from the solutions of the effective dynamics
is characterised by infinitely many pairs of trapped and anti-trapped regions connected via a space-like
transition surface replacing the central singularity. Quantum effects become relevant at a unique
mass independent curvature scale, while they become negligible in the low curvature region near
the horizon. The effective quantum metric describes also the exterior regions and asymptotically
classical Schwarzschild geometry is recovered. We however find that physically acceptable solutions
require us to select a certain subset of initial conditions, corresponding to a specific mass (de-)amplification
after the bounce. We also sketch the corresponding quantum theory and explicitly compute the kernel
of the Hamiltonian constraint operator.
