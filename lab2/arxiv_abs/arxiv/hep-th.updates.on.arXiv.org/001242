Solutions-generating methods based on field redefinitions, such as conformal mapping, play an
important role in investigating exact solutions in modified gravity. In this work, we explore the
possibility to use disformal field redefinitions to investigate new regions of the solution space
of DHOST theories. The crucial ingredient is to find suitable seed solutions to generate new exact
ones for DHOST theories. We first consider a seed solution of the Einstein-Scalar system describing
a naked singularity. Under suitable assumptions, we derive a no-go result showing that no black
hole solution can be constructed from such a seed GR solution. Then, taking into account the stability
of each degeneracy classes of quadratic DHOST theories under a general disformal mapping, we consider
two kinds of known black hole solutions as seed configurations: the Schwarzschild stealth solution
and the non-stealth Reissner-Nordstrom like solution. Restricting our considerations to invertible
disformal transformations, we show that building new hairy black hole solutions from the stealth
solution associated to a constant kinetic term is also quite constrained. We obtain new solutions
which either are stealth or describe asymptotically locally flat black holes with a deficit solid
angle. However, starting from the non-stealth seed solution associated to a non constant kinetic
term as well as a time-dependent scalar profile, we show that a disformal transformation can introduce
rather general modifications of the exterior geometry. Finally, we consider the construction
of minimally modified hairy black hole solutions using a small disformal transformation. Further
applications of this solution generating method should allow to provide new hairy rotating black
hole solutions beyond the stealth sector useful for phenomenological investigations of compact
objects beyond GR.
