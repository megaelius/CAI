To date, all proposed quantum algorithms for simulating quantum field theory (QFT) simulate (continuous-time)
Hamiltonian lattice QFT as a stepping stone. Two overlooked issues are how large we can take the timestep
in these simulations while getting the right physics and whether we can go beyond the standard recipe
that relies on Hamiltonian lattice QFT. The first issue is crucial in practice for, e.g., trapped-ion
experiments which actually have a lower bound on the possible ratio of timestep to lattice spacing.
To this end, we show that a timestep equal to or going to zero faster than the spatial lattice spacing
is necessary for quantum simulations of QFT, but far more importantly a timestep equal to the lattice
spacing is actually sufficient. To do this, first for $\phi^4$ theory, we give a quantum circuit
exactly equivalent to the real-time path integral from the discrete-time Lagrangian formulation
of lattice QFT. Next we give another circuit with no lattice QFT analogue, but, by using Feynman rules
applied to the circuit, we see that it also reproduces the correct continuum behaviour. Finally,
we look at non-abelian gauge fields, showing that the discrete-time lattice QFT path-integral
is exactly equivalent to a finite-depth local circuit. All of these circuits have an analogue of
a lightcone on the lattice and therefore are examples of quantum cellular automata. Aside from the
potential practical benefit of these circuits, this all suggests that the path-integral approach
to lattice QFT need not be overlooked in quantum simulations of physics and has a simple quantum information
interpretation.
