We present new anisotropic black brane solutions in 5D Einstein-dilaton-two-Maxwell system.
The anisotropic background is specified by an arbitrary dynamical exponent $\nu$, a nontrivial
warp factor, a non-zero dilaton field, a non-zero time component of the first Maxwell field and a
non-zero longitudinal magnetic component of the second Maxwell field. The blackening function
supports the Van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large black holes for a suitable
first Maxwell field charge. The isotropic case corresponding to $\nu = 1$ and zero magnetic field
reproduces previously known solutions. We investigate the anisotropy influence on the thermodynamic
properties of our background, in particular, on the small/large black holes phase transition diagram.
We discuss applications of the model to the bottom-up holographic QCD. The RG flow interpolates
between the UV section with two suppressed transversal coordinates and the IR section with the suppressed
time and longitudinal coordinates due to anisotropic character of our solution. We study the temporal
Wilson loops, extended in longitudinal and transversal directions, by calculating the minimal
surfaces of the corresponding probing open string world-sheet in anisotropic backgrounds with
various temperatures and chemical potentials. We find that dynamical wall locations depend on
the orientation of the quark pairs, that gives a crossover transition line between confinement/deconfinement
phases in the dual gauge theory. Instability of the background leads to the appearance of the critical
points $(\mu_{\vartheta,b}, T_{\vartheta,b})$ depending on the orientation $\vartheta$ of
quark-antiquark pairs in respect to the heavy ions collision line.
