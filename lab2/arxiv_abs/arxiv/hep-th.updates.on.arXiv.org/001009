Weyl conformal geometry may play a role in early cosmology where effective theory at short distances
becomes conformal. Weyl conformal geometry also has a built-in geometric Stueckelberg mechanism:
it is broken spontaneously to Riemannian geometry after a particular Weyl gauge transformation
(of "gauge fixing") while Stueckelberg mechanism re-arranges the degrees of freedom, conserving
their number ($n_{df}$). The Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$) of local scale transformations acquires
a mass after absorbing a compensator (dilaton), decouples, and Weyl connection becomes Riemannian.
In applications, the "gauge fixing" symmetry transformation of the original Weyl's quadratic
gravity action immediately gives the Einstein-Proca action for the Weyl gauge field and a positive
cosmological constant, plus matter action (if present). As a result, the Planck scale is an emergent
scale, where Weyl gauge symmetry is broken. This situation is in contrast to local scale invariant
models (no gauging) where a negative kinetic term (ghost dilaton) is present and $n_{df}$ is not
conserved when this symmetry is broken. Further, the mass of $\omega_\mu$, setting the non-metricity
scale, can be much smaller than $M_\text{Planck}$, for ultraweak values of the coupling ($q$),
with implications for phenomenology. If matter is present, a {\it positive} contribution to the
Planck scale from a scalar field ($\phi_1$) vev induces a {\it negative} (mass)$^2$ term for $\phi_1$
and spontaneous breaking of the symmetry under which it is charged. These results are immediate
when using Weyl-covariant (invariant) scalar (tensor) curvatures, respectively, instead of
their Riemannian form. The results show that Weyl gauge symmetry is physically relevant and its
role in high scale physics should be reconsidered.
