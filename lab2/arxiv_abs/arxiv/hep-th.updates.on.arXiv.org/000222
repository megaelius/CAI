We consider F-strings with arbitrary configurations in the Minkowski directions of a higher-dimensional
spacetime, which also wrap and spin around $S^1$ subcycles of constant radius in an arbitrary internal
manifold. We show that, for any such configuration, the motion of the windings in the compact space
may render the string effectively tensionless from a four-dimensional perspective, so that it
remains static with respect to the large dimensions. Such a critical configuration occurs when
exactly half the square of the string length lies in the large dimensions and half lies in the compact
space. As examples, long straight strings and circular loops are considered in detail, and the solutions
to the equations of motion, that are compatible with the tensionless condition, are presented.
The critical solution is then seen to arise as a special case, in which the wavelength of the windings
is equal to their circumference. Under the process of dimensional reduction, in which higher-dimensional
motion is equivalent to an effective worldsheet current (giving rise to a conserved charge), this
phenomenon may be seen as the analogue of the tensionless condition which arises for superconducting
and chiral-current carrying cosmic strings. As such, the analysis presented here represents a
generalization of previous results for current carrying, but uncharged cosmic strings [1-4],
as well as of those obtained for vorton type models [5-14]. We present the first explicit analysis
of the tensionless state in a higher-dimensional context, and determine the precise relationship
between the higher-dimensional and effective four-dimensional quantities that govern the string
dynamics.
