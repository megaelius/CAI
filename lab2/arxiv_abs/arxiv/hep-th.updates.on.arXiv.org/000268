We consider gedanken experiments to destroy an extremal or nearly extremal Kerr-Newman black hole
by causing it to absorb matter with sufficient charge and/or angular momentum as compared with energy
that it cannot remain a black hole. It was previously shown by one of us that such gedanken experiments
cannot succeed for test particle matter entering an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. We generalize
this result here to arbitrary matter entering an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole, provided only
that the non-electromagnetic contribution to the stress-energy tensor of the matter satisfies
the null energy condition. We then analyze the gedanken experiments proposed by Hubeny and others
to over-charge and/or over-spin an initially slightly non-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. Analysis
of such gedanken experiments requires that we calculate all effects on the final mass of the black
hole that are second-order in the charge and angular momentum carried into the black hole, including
all self-force effects. We obtain a general formula for the full second order correction to mass,
$\delta^2 M$, which allows us to prove that no gedanken experiments of the generalized Hubeny type
can ever succeed in over-charging and/or over-spinning a Kerr-Newman black hole, provided only
that the non-electromagnetic stress-energy tensor satisfies the null energy condition. Our analysis
is based upon Lagrangian methods, and our formula for the second-order correction to mass is obtained
by generalizing the canonical energy analysis of Hollands and Wald to the Einstein-Maxwell case.
Remarkably, we obtain our formula for $\delta^2 M$ without having to explicitly compute self-force
or finite size effects. Indeed, in an appendix, we show explicitly that our formula incorporates
both the self-force and finite size effects for the special case of a charged body slowly lowered
into an uncharged black hole.
