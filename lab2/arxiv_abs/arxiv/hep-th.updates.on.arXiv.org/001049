The main result of this note is that the Weyl anomaly of a $z=2$ (1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz effective
action found in \cite{Oz2014} can be derived from a (2+1)-dimensional non-relativistic Schrodinger-invariant
Chern-Simons (NRSCS) action constructed in \cite{ObersNRSCS} which was shown to be equivalent
to a specific Weyl-invariant non-projectable Horava-Lifshitz action of gravity. On a manifold
with a boundary, we will show that the (1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz Weyl anomaly can be derived from
a specific term, the torsional CS (tCS) term, in the NRSCS action built from the gauge fields of the
Weyl and special conformal symmetry generators of the centrally-extended Schrodinger algebra.
We also focus on the $z=1$ Lifshitz Weyl anomaly and attempt to elicit its geometric and physical
nature, in particular its relationship with the Lorentz anomaly of a (1+1)-dimensional CFT effective
actions. We show that it is directly related to the curvature scalar of the dual Lorentz connection
$d\star\omega$, the integral of which is known to be a topological invariant. We also point out that
making the anomalous Lifshitz quantum effective action Weyl-invariant amounts to obtaining an
for a stationary chiral boson, the spatial-component of the acceleration vector. By putting boundary
conditions on the spatial slices, the time dependence of the lapse function in the Arnowitt, Deser
and Misner (ADM) decomposition is eliminated and the result is a Rindler metric. We finally discuss
several issues related to the (1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz Weyl anomaly regarding edge physics
of fractional quantum Hall states and anomaly cancellation by anomaly inflow.
