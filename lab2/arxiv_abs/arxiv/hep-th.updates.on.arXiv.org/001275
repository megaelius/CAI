In this paper, the curvature structure of a (2+1)-dimensional black hole in the massive-charged-Born-Infeld
gravity is investigated. The metric that we consider is characterized by four degrees of freedom
which are the mass and electric charge of the black hole, the mass of the graviton field, and a cosmological
constant. For the charged and neutral cases separately, we present various constraints among scalar
polynomial curvature invariants which could invariantly characterize our desired spacetimes.
Specially, an appropriate scalar polynomial curvature invariant and a Cartan curvature invariant
which together could detect the black hole horizon would be explicitly constructed. Using algorithms
related to the focusing properties of a bundle of light rays on the horizon which are accounted by
the Raychaudhuri equation, a procedure for isolating the black hole parameters, as the algebraic
combinations involving the curvature invariants, would be presented. It will be shown that this
technique could specially be applied for black holes with zero electric charge, contrary to the
cases of solutions of lower-dimensional non-massive gravity. In addition, for the case of massive
(2+1)-dimensional black hole, the irreducible mass, which quantifies the maximum amount of energy
which could be extracted from a black hole through the Penrose process would be derived. Therefore,
we show that the Hawking temperatures of these black holes could be reduced to the pure curvature
properties of the spacetimes. Finally, we comment on the relationship between our analysis and
the novel roles it could play in numerical quark-gluon plasma simulations and other QCD models and
also black hole information paradox where the holographic correspondence could be exploited.
