Fractional statistics is one of the most intriguing features of topological phases in 2D. In particular,
the so-called non-Abelian statistics plays a crucial role towards realizing universal topological
quantum computation. Recently, the study of topological phases has been extended to 3D and it has
been proposed that loop-like extensive objects can also carry fractional statistics. In this work,
we systematically study the so-called three-loop braiding statistics for loop-like excitations
for 3D fermionic topological phases. Most surprisingly, we discovered new types of non-Abelian
three-loop braiding statistics that can only be realized in fermionic systems (or equivalently
bosonic systems with fermionic particles). The simplest example of such non-Abelian braiding
statistics can be realized in interacting fermionic systems with a gauge group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_8$ or $\mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$, and the physical origin of non-Abelian
statistics can be viewed as attaching an open Majorana chain onto a pair of linked loops, which will
naturally reduce to the well known Ising non-Abelian statistics via the standard dimension reduction
scheme. Moreover, due to the correspondence between gauge theories with fermionic particles and
classifying fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases with unitary symmetries,
our study also give rise to an alternative way to classify FSPT phases with unitary symmetries. We
further compare the classification results for FSPT phases with arbitrary Abelian total symmetry
$G^f$ and find systematical agreement with previous studies using other methods. We believe that
the proposed framework of understanding three-loop braiding statistics (including both Abelian
and non-Abelian cases) in interacting fermion systems applies for generic fermonic topological
phases in 3D.
