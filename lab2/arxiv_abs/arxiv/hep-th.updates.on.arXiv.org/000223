We develop a semi-holographic model for the out-of-equilibrium dynamics during the partonic stages
of an ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision. The model combines a weakly-coupled hard sector,
involving gluon modes with energy and momenta of the order of the saturation momentum and relatively
large occupation numbers, with a strongly-coupled soft sector, which physically represents the
soft gluons radiated by the hard partons. The hard sector is described by perturbative QCD, more
precisely, by its semi-classical approximation (the classical Yang-Mills equations) which becomes
appropriate when the occupation numbers are large. The soft sector is described by a marginally
deformed conformal field theory, which in turn admits a holographic description in terms of classical
Einstein's equations in $AdS_5$ with a minimally coupled massless `dilaton'. The model involve
two free parameters which characterize the gauge-invariant couplings between the hard and soft
sectors. Via these couplings, the hard modes provide dynamical sources for the gravitational equations
at the boundary of $AdS_5$ and feel the feedback of the latter as additional soft sources in the classical
Yang-Mills equations. Importantly, the initial conditions for this coupled dynamics are fully
determined by the hard sector alone, i.e. by perturbative QCD, and are conveniently given by the
color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. We also develop a new semi-holographic picture
of jets in the QGP by attaching a non-Abelian charge to the endpoint of the trailing string in $AdS_5$
representing a heavy quark. This leads to modified Nambu-Goto equations for the string which govern
the (collisional and radiative) energy loss by the heavy quark towards both hard and soft modes.
