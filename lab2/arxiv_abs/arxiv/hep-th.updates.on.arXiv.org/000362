The static region outside the event horizon of an asymptotically anti de Sitter black hole has a conformal
timelike boundary $\mathscr{I}$ on which boundary conditions have to be imposed for the evolution
of linear fields from initial data to be a well posed problem. Only homogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann
or Robin conditions preserve the action of the background isometry group on the solution space.
We study the case in which the modal decomposition of the linear field leads to potentials not diverging
at the conformal timelike boundary. We prove that there is always an instability if Robin boundary
conditions with large enough $\gamma$ (the quotient between the values of the derivative of the
field and the field at the boundary) are allowed. We explain the origin of this instability, show
that for modes with nonnegative potentials there is a single unstable state and prove a number of
properties of this state. Although our results apply in general to 1+1 wave equations on a half infinite
domain with a potential that is not singular at the boundary, our motivation is to analyze the gravitational
stability of the four dimensional Schwarzschild anti de Sitter black holes (SAdS${}_4$) in the
context of the black hole non modal linear stability program initiated in Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf
112}, 191101 (2014), and the related supersymmetric type of duality exchanging odd and even modes.
We prove that this symmetry is broken except when a combination of Dirichlet conditions in the even
sector and a particular Robin condition in the odd sector is enforced, or viceversa, and that only
the first of these two choices leads to a stable dynamics.
