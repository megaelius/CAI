We reconstruct the explicit formalism of qubit quantum theory from elementary rules on an observer's
information acquisition. Our approach is purely operational: we consider an observer O interrogating
a system S with binary questions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. From
the rules we derive the state spaces for N elementary systems and show that (a) they coincide with
the set of density matrices over an N-qubit Hilbert space; (b) states evolve unitarily under the
group $\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the von Neumann evolution equation; and (c) O's binary questions
correspond to projective Pauli operator measurements with outcome probabilities given by the
Born rule. As a by-product, this results in a propositional formulation of quantum theory. Aside
from offering an informational explanation for the theory's architecture, the reconstruction
also unravels new structural insights. We show that, in a derived quadratic information measure,
(d) qubits satisfy inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually complementary
questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually complementary questions for one and two qubits
must carry precisely 1 bit of information in pure states. The latter relations constitute conserved
informational charges which define the unitary groups and, together with their conservation conditions,
the sets of pure quantum states. These results highlight information as a `charge of quantum theory'
and the benefits of this informational approach. This work emphasizes the sufficiency of restricting
to an observer's information to reconstruct the theory and completes the quantum reconstruction
initiated in arXiv:1412.8323.
