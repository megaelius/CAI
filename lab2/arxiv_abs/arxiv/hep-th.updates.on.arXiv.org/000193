A multiparametric family of 2D Toda $\tau$-functions of hypergeometric type is shown to provide
generating functions for composite, signed Hurwitz numbers that enumerate certain classes of
branched coverings of the Riemann sphere and paths in the Cayley graph of $S_n$. The coefficients
$F^{c_1, \dots, c_l}_{d_1, \dots, d_m}(\mu, \nu)$ in their series expansion over products $P_\mu
P'_\nu$ of power sum symmetric functions in the two sets of Toda flow parameters and powers of the
$l+m$ auxiliary parameters are shown to enumerate $|\mu|=|\nu|=n$ fold branched covers of the
Riemann sphere with specified ramification profiles $ \mu$ and $\nu$ at a pair of points, and two
sets of additional branch paints, satisfying certain additional conditions on their ramification
profile lengths. The first group consists of $l$ branch points, with ramification profile lengths
fixed to be the numbers $(n-c_1, \dots, n- c_l)$; the second consists of $m$ further groups of "coloured"
branch points, of variable number, for which the sums of the complements of the ramification profile
lengths within the groups are fixed to equal the numbers $(d_1, \dots, d_m)$. The latter are counted
with sign determined by the parity of the total number of such branch points. The coefficients $F^{c_1,
\dots, c_l}_{d_1, \dots, d_m}(\mu, \nu)$ are also shown to enumerate paths in the Cayley graph of
the symmetric group $S_n$ generated by transpositions, starting, as in the usual double Hurwitz
case, at an element in the conjugacy class of cycle type $\mu$ and ending in the class of type $\nu$,
but with the first $l$ consecutive subsequences of $(c_1, \dots, c_l)$ transpositions strictly
monotonically increasing, and the subsequent subsequences of $(d_1, \dots, d_m)$ transpositions
weakly increasing.
