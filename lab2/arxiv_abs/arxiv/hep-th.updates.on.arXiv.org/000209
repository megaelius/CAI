The transfer operator (TO) formalism of the dynamical systems (DS) theory is reformulated here
in terms of the recently proposed cohomological theory (ChT) of stochastic differential equations
(SDE). It turns out that the stochastically generalized TO (GTO) of the DS theory is the finite-time
ChT Fokker-Planck evolution operator. As a result comes the supersymmetric trivialization of
the so-called sharp trace and sharp determinant of the GTO, with the former being the Witten index
of the ChT. Furthermore, the Witten index is the stochastic generalization of the Lefschetz index
so that (for closed phase spaces) it equals the Euler characteristic for any flow vector field, noise
metric, and temperature. The enabled possibility to apply the spectral theorems of the DS theory
to the ChT Fokker-Planck operators allows to extend the previous picture of the spontaneous topological
supersymmetry (Q-symmetry) breaking onto the situations with negative ground state's attenuation
rate. The later signifies the exponential growth of the number of periodic solutions/orbits in
the large time limit, which is the unique feature of chaotic behavior proving that the spontaneous
breakdown of Q-symmetry is indeed the field-theoretic definition and stochastic generalization
of the concept of deterministic chaos. In addition, the previous low-temperature classification
of SDE's, i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium / noise-induced chaos ((anti)instanton condensation,
intermittent) / ordinary chaos, is complemented by the discussion of the high-temperature regime,
in which the sharp boundary between the noise-induced and ordinary chaotic phases must smear out
into a crossover, and at even higher temperatures the Q-symmetry is restored.
