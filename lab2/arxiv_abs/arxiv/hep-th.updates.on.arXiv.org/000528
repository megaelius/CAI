Recently there has been much interest in light dark matter, especially ultra-light axions, as they
may provide a solution to the core-cusp problem at the center of galaxies. Since very light bosons
can have a de Broglie wavelength that is of astrophysical size, they can smooth out the centers of
galaxies to produce a core, as opposed to vanilla dark matter models, and so it has been suggested
that this solves the core-cusp problem. In this work, we critically examine this claim. While an
ultra-light particle will indeed lead to a core, we examine whether the relationship between the
density of the core and its radius matches the data over a range of galaxies. We first review data that
shows the core density of a galaxy $\rho_c$ varies as a function of the core radius $R_c$ as $\rho_c\propto1/R_c^\beta$
with $\beta\approx1$. We then compare this to theoretical models. We examine a large class of light
scalar dark matter models, governed by some potential $V$. For simplicity, we take the scalar to
be complex with a global $U(1)$ symmetry in order to readily organize solutions by a conserved particle
number. However, we expect our central conclusions to persist even for a real scalar, and furthermore,
a complex scalar matches the behavior of a real scalar in the non-relativistic limit, which is the
standard regime of interest. For any potential $V$, we find the relationship between $\rho_c$ and
$R_c$ for ground state solutions is always in one of the following regimes: (i) $\beta\gg1$, or (ii)
$\beta\ll1$, or (iii) unstable, and so it never matches the data. We also find similar conclusions
for virialized dark matter, more general scalar field theories, degenerate fermion dark matter,
superfluid dark matter, and general polytropes. We conclude that the solution to the core-cusp
problem is more likely due to either complicated baryonic effects or some other type of dark matter
interactions.
