The presence of a horizon is the principal marker for black holes as they appear in the classical theory
of gravity. In General Relativity (GR), horizons have several defining properties. First, there
exists a static spherically symmetric solution to vacuum Einstein equations which possesses a
horizon defined as a null-surface on which the time-like Killing vector becomes null. Second, in
GR, a co-dimension two sphere of minimal area is necessarily a horizon. On a quantum level, the classical
gravitational action is supplemented by the quantum effective action obtained by integrating
out the quantum fields propagating on a classical background. In this note we consider the case when
the quantum fields are conformal and perform a certain non-perturbative analysis of the semiclassical
equations obtained by varying the complete gravitational action. We show that, for these equations,
both of the above aspects do not hold. More precisely, we prove that i) a static spherically symmetric
metric that would describe a horizon with a finite Hawking temperature is, generically, {\it not}
a solution; ii) a minimal $2$-sphere is {\it not} a horizon but a tiny throat of a wormhole. We find
certain bounds on the norm of the Killing vector at the throat and show that it is, while non-zero,
an exponentially small function of the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy of the classical black
hole. We also find that the possible temperature of the semiclassical geometry is exponentially
small for large black holes. These findings suggest that a black hole in the classical theory can
be viewed as a certain (singular) limit of the semiclassical wormhole geometry. We discuss the possible
implications of our results.
