Advanced methods for computing perturbative, quantum-gravitational scattering amplitudes
show great promise for improving our knowledge of classical gravitational dynamics. This is especially
true in the weak-field and arbitrary-speed (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime, where the conservative
dynamics at 3PM order has been recently determined for the first time, via an amplitude calculation.
Such PM results are most relevantly applicable to relativistic scattering (unbound orbits), while
bound/inspiraling binary systems, the most frequent sources of gravitational waves for the LIGO
and Virgo detectors, are most suitably modeled by the weak-field and slow-motion (post-Newtonian,
PN) approximation. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that PM results can independently lead to
improved modeling of bound binary dynamics, especially when taken as inputs for effective-one-body
(EOB) models of inspiraling binaries. Here, we initiate a quantitative study of this possibility,
by comparing PM, EOB and PN predictions for the binding energy of a two-body system on a quasi-circular
inspiraling orbit against results of numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The binding energy
is one of the two central ingredients (the other being the gravitational-wave energy flux) that
enters the computation of gravitational waveforms employed by LIGO and Virgo detectors, and for
(quasi-)circular orbits it provides an accurate diagnostic of the conservative sector of a model.
We find that, whereas 3PM results do improve the agreement with NR with respect to 2PM (especially
when used in the EOB framework), it is crucial to push PM calculations at higher orders if one wants
to achieve better performances than current waveform models used for LIGO/Virgo data analysis.
