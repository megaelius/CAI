I show that the gravitational dynamics in a bulk region of space can be connected to a thermodynamic
description in the boundary of that region, thereby providing clear physical interpretations
of several mathematical features of classical general relativity: (1) The Noether charge contained
in a bulk region, associated with a specific time evolution vector field, has a direct thermodynamic
interpretation as the gravitational heat content of the boundary surface. (2) This result, in turn,
shows that all static spacetimes maintain holographic equipartition; in these spacetimes, the
number of degrees of freedom in the boundary is equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk.
(3) In a general, evolving spacetime, the rate of change of gravitational momentum is related to
the difference between the number of bulk and boundary degrees of freedom. It is this departure from
the holographic equipartition which drives the time evolution of the spacetime. (4) When the equations
of motion hold, the (naturally defined) total energy of the gravity plus matter within a bulk region,
will be equal to the boundary heat content. (5) After motivating the need for an alternate description
of gravity (if we have to solve the cosmological constant problem), I describe a thermodynamic variational
principle based on null surfaces to achieve this goal. The concept of gravitational heat density
of the null surfaces arises naturally from the Noether charge associated with the null congruence.
The null surface variational principle, in fact, extremises the total heat content of the matter
plus gravity system. Several variations on this theme and implications are described. [Abridged]
