We use the method of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant to analyze the dynamical properties of the Mukhanov-Sasaki
Hamiltonian and, following this approach, investigate whether we can obtain possible candidates
for initial states in the context of inflation considering a quasi-de Sitter spacetime. Our main
interest lies in the question to which extent these already well-established methods at the classical
and quantum level for finitely many degrees of freedom can be generalized to field theory. As our
results show, a straightforward generalization does in general not lead to a unitary operator on
Fock space that implements the corresponding time-dependent canonical transformation associated
with the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. The action of this operator can be rewritten as a time-dependent
Bogoliubov transformation and we show that its generalization to Fock space has to be chosen appropriately
in order that the Shale-Stinespring condition is not violated, where we also compare our results
to already existing ones in the literature. Furthermore, our analysis relates the Ermakov differential
equation that plays the role of an auxiliary equation, whose solution is necessary to construct
the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant, as well as the corresponding time-dependent canonical transformation
to the defining differential equation for adiabatic vacua. Therefore, a given solution of the Ermakov
equation directly yields a full solution to the differential equation for adiabatic vacua involving
no truncation at some adiabatic order. As a consequence, we can interpret our result obtained here
as a kind of non-squeezed Bunch-Davies mode, where the term non-squeezed refers to a possible residual
squeezing that can be involved in the unitary operator for certain choices of the Bogoliubov map.
