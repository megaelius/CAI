After a brief outline of general aspects of conformal field theories in coordinate space, in a first
part we review the solution of the conformal constraints of 3- and 4-point functions in momentum
space in dimensions $d\geq 2$, in the form of conformal Ward identities (CWI's). We center our discussion
on the analysis of correlators containing stress-energy tensors $(T)$, conserved currents $(J)$,
and scalar operators $(O)$. For scalar 4-point functions, we briefly discuss our method for determining
the dual conformal solutions of such equations, identified only by the CWI's, and related to the
dcc (dual conformal/conformal) symmetry, introduced by us in previous work. In correlation functions
with $T$ tensors, the conformal anomaly is characterized by the the (nonlocal) exchange of massless
poles in specific form factors, which has been investigated both in free field theory and non-perturbatively,
by solving the conformal constraints. We present a pedagogical derivation of the non-local anomaly
action, its prediction for 2- and 3-point functions and their matching to free-field theories.
Perturbative realizations of CFTs at one-loop provide the simplest expressions of the general
solutions identified by the CWI's, for generic operators $T$, and $J$, and scalars of specific scaling
dimensions, by an appropriate choice of their field content. In a technical appendix we offer details
on the reconstruction of the $TTO$ and $TTT$ correlators in the approach of Bzowski, McFadden and
Skenderis, and specifically on the secondary Ward identities of the method, in order to establish
a complete match with the perturbative description.
