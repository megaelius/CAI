The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature bispectrum is currently the most precise tool
for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). The Planck temperature data tightly constrain
the amplitude of local-type NG: $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} = 2.5 \pm 5.7$. Here, we compute previously-neglected
foreground biases in temperature-based $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ measurements. We consider the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, gravitational lensing, the thermal (tSZ) and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effects, and the cosmic infrared background (CIB). In standard analyses,
a significant foreground bias arising from the ISW-lensing bispectrum is subtracted from the $f_{\rm
NL}^{\rm loc}$ measurement. However, many other terms sourced by the ISW, lensing, tSZ, kSZ, and
CIB fields are also present in the temperature bispectrum. We compute the dominant biases on $f_{\rm
NL}^{\rm loc}$ arising from these signals. Most of the biases are non-blackbody, and are thus reduced
by multifrequency component separation methods; however, recent analyses have found that extragalactic
foregrounds are present at non-negligible levels in the Planck component-separated maps. Moreover,
the Planck FFP8 simulations do not include the correlations amongst components that are responsible
for these biases. We compute the biases for individual frequencies, finding that some are comparable
to the statistical error bar on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, even for the main CMB channels (100, 143,
and 217 GHz). For future experiments, they can greatly exceed the statistical error bar (considering
temperature only). A full assessment will require calculations in tandem with component separation,
ideally using simulations. Similar biases will also afflict measurements of equilateral and orthogonal
NG, as well as trispectrum NG. We conclude that the search for primordial NG using Planck data may
not yet be over.
