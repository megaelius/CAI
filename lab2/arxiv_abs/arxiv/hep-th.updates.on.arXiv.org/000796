We study five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to five vector multiplets with compact
and non-compact gauge groups $U(1)\times SU(2)\times SU(2)$ and $U(1)\times SO(3,1)$. For $U(1)\times
SU(2)\times SU(2)$ gauge group, we identify $N=4$ $AdS_5$ vacua with $U(1)\times SU(2)\times
SU(2)$ and $U(1)\times SU(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries and analytically construct the corresponding
holographic RG flow interpolating between these critical points. The flow describes a deformation
of the dual $N=2$ SCFT driven by vacuum expaction values of dimension-two operators. In addition,
we study $AdS_3\times \Sigma_2$ geometries, for $\Sigma_2$ being a two-sphere $S^2$ or a two-dimensional
hyperbolic space $H^2$, dual to twisted compactifications of $N=2$ SCFTs with flavor symmetry
$SU(2)$. We find a number of $AdS_3\times H^2$ solutions preserving eight supercharges for different
twists from $U(1)\times U(1)\times U(1)$ and $U(1)\times U(1)_{\textrm{diag}}$ gauge fields.
We numerically construct various RG flow solutions interpolating between $N=4$ $AdS_5$ ciritcal
points and these $AdS_3\times H^2$ geometries in the IR. The solutions can also be interpreted as
supersymmetric black strings in asymptotically $AdS_5$ space. These types of holographic solutions
are also studied in non-compact $U(1)\times SO(3,1)$ gauge group. In this case, only one $N=4$ $AdS_5$
vacuum exists, and we give an RG flow solution from this $AdS_5$ to a singular geometry in the IR corresponding
to an $N=2$ non-conformal field theory. An $AdS_3\times H^2$ solution together with an RG flow between
this vacuum and the $N=4$ $AdS_5$ are also given.
