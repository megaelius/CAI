In this thesis, we study the implications of Quantum Gravity models for the dynamics of spacetime
and the ensuing departures from classical General Relativity. The main focus is on cosmological
applications, particularly the impact of quantum gravitational effects on the dynamics of a homogenous
and isotropic cosmological background. Our interest lies in the consequences for the evolution
of the early universe and singularity resolution, as well as in the possibility of providing an alternative
explanation for dark matter and dark energy in the late universe. The thesis is divided into two main
parts, dedicated to alternative (and complementary) ways of tackling the problem of Quantum Gravity.
The first part is concerned with cosmological applications of background independent approaches
to Quantum Gravity, both in the context of loop quantisation and in quantum geometrodynamics. Particularly
relevant in this work is the Group Field Theory approach, which we use to study the effective dynamics
of the emergent universe from a full theory of Quantum Gravity (i.e. without symmetry reduction).
In the second part, modified gravity theories are introduced as tools to provide an effective description
of quantum gravitational effects, e.g. by introducing new degrees of freedom and symmetries. Particularly
relevant in this respect is local conformal invariance, which finds a natural realisation in the
framework of Weyl geometry. We build a modified theory of gravity based on such symmetry principle,
and argue that new fields in the extended gravitational sector may play the role of dark matter. New
degrees of freedom are also natural in models with varying fundamental `constants', which we examine
critically. Finally, we discuss prospects for future work and point at directions for the derivation
of realistic cosmological models from Quantum Gravity candidates.
