The accuracy of the current generation of cosmic-ray (CR) experiments, such as AMS-02, PAMELA,
CALET, and ISS-CREAM, is now reaching $\sim$1--3\% in a wide range in energy per nucleon from GeV/n
to multi-TeV/n. Their correct interpretation could potentially lead to discoveries of new physics
and subtle effects that were unthinkable just a decade ago. However, a major obstacle in doing so
is the current uncertainty in the isotopic production cross sections that can be as high as 20--50\%
or even larger in some cases. While there is a recently reached consensus in the astrophysics community
that new measurements of cross sections are desirable, no attempt to evaluate the importance of
particular reaction channels and their required accuracy has been made yet. It is, however, clear
that it is a huge work that requires an incremental approach. The goal of this study is to provide the
ranking of the isotopic cross sections contributing to the production of the most astrophysically
important CR Li, Be, B, C, and N species. In this paper, we (i) rank the reaction channels by their importance
for a production of a particular isotope, (ii) provide comparisons plots between the models and
data used, and (iii) evaluate a generic beam time necessary to reach a 3\% precision in the production
cross-sections pertinent to the AMS-02 experiment. This first roadmap may become a starting point
in the planning of new measurement campaigns that could be carried out in several nuclear and/or
particle physics facilities around the world. A comprehensive evaluation of other isotopes $Z\leq30$
will be a subject of follow-up studies.
