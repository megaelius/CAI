Feynman's sum-over-histories formulation of quantum mechanics is reviewed as an independent
statement of quantum theory in spacetime form. It is different from the usual Schr\"odinger-Heisenberg
formulation that utilizes states on spacelike surfaces because it assigns probabilities to different
sets of alternatives. Sum-over-histories quantum mechanics can be generalized to deal with spacetime
alternatives that are not "at definite moments of time". An example in field theory is the set of alternative
ranges of values of a field averaged over a spacetime region. An example in particle mechanics is
the set of the alternatives defined by whether a particle never crosses a fixed spacetime region
or crosses it at least once. The general notion of a set of spacetime alternatives is a partition (coarse-graining)
of the histories into an exhaustive set of exclusive classes. With this generalization the sum-over-histories
formulation can be said to be in fully spacetime form with dynamics represented by path integrals
over spacetime histories and alternatives defined as spacetime partitions of these histories.
When restricted to alternatives at definite moments of times this generalization is equivalent
to Schr\"odinger-Heisenberg quantum mechanics. However, the quantum mechanics of more general
spacetime alternatives does not have an equivalent Schr\"odinger-Heisenberg formulation. We
suggest that, in the quantum theory of gravity, the general notion of "observable" is supplied by
diffeomorphism invariant partitions of spacetime metrics and matter field configurations. By
generalizing the usual alternatives so as to put quantum theory in fully spacetime form we may be
led to a covariant generalized quantum mechanics of spacetime free from the problem of time.
