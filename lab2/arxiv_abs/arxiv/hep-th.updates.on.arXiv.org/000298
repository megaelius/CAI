We compute four-point functions of two heavy and two "perturbatively heavy" operators in the semiclassical
limit of Liouville theory on the sphere. We obtain these "Heavy-Heavy-Light-Light" (HHLL) correlators
to leading order in the conformal weights of the light insertions in two ways: (a) via a path integral
approach, combining different methods to evaluate correlation functions from complex solutions
for the Liouville field, and (b) via the conformal block expansion. This latter approach identifies
an integral over the continuum of normalizable states and a sum over an infinite tower of lighter
discrete states, whose contribution we extract by analytically continuing standard results to
our HHLL setting. The sum over this tower reproduces the sum over those complex saddlepoints of the
path integral that contribute to the correlator. Our path integral computations reveal that when
the two light operators are inserted at equal time in radial quantization, the leading-order HHLL
correlator is independent of their separation, and more generally that at this order there is no
short-distance singularity as the two light operators approach each other. The conformal block
expansion likewise shows that in the discrete sum short-distance singularities are indeed absent
for all intermediate states that contribute. In particular, the Virasoro vacuum block, which would
have been singular at short distances, is not exchanged. The separation-independence of equal-time
correlators is due to cancelations between the discrete contributions. These features lead to
a Lorentzian singularity that, in conformal theories with anti-de Sitter (AdS) duals, would be
associated to locality below the AdS scale.
