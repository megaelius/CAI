We implement the effective field theory for gravitating spinning objects in the post-Newtonian
scheme at the next-to-next-to-leading order level to derive the gravitational spin-orbit interaction
potential at the third and a half post-Newtonian order for rapidly rotating compact objects. From
the next-to-next-to-leading order interaction potential, which we obtain here in a Lagrangian
form for the first time, we derive straightforwardly the corresponding Hamiltonian. The spin-orbit
sector constitutes the most elaborate spin dependent sector at each order, and accordingly we encounter
a proliferation of the relevant Feynman diagrams, and a significant increase of the computational
complexity. We present the evaluation of the interaction potential, going over contributing Feynman
diagrams. The computation is carried out in terms of the nonrelativistic gravitational fields,
together with the various gauge choices included in the effective field theory for gravitating
spinning objects, which optimize the calculation. In addition, we automatize the effective field
theory computations, and carry out the automated computations in parallel. Such automated effective
field theory computations would be most useful to obtain higher order post-Newtonian corrections.
We compare our Hamiltonian to the ADM Hamiltonian, and arrive at a complete agreement between the
ADM and effective field theory results. We provide complete gauge invariant relations among the
binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital frequency of an inspiralling binary with generic
compact spinning components to third and a half post-Newtonian order. The derivation presented
here is essential to obtain further higher order post-Newtonian corrections, and to reach the accuracy
level required for the successful detection of gravitational radiation.
