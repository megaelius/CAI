We apply the random matrix theory to classify the quantum chaos in the colored SYK model first introduced
by Gross and Rosenhaus (which may also be called Gross and Rosenhaus model ). We focus on the two colored
case and four colored case with balanced number of sites $ N $. By identifying the maximal symmetries,
the independent parity conservation sectors, the minimum ( irreducible ) Hilbert space, especially
the relevant anti-unitary operators, we show that the color degree of freedoms lead to novel RMT
behaviours. When $ N $ is odd, different symmetry operators need to be constructed to make the classifications
complete. Depending on $ N mod 4=0,1,2,3 $, for two colored case, the ELS satisfies GOE, GOE, GUE and
GOE respectively. For four colored case, depending on $ N mod 4=0,1,2,3 $, the ELS satisfies BDI,
GOE, CI and GOE respectively. For the BDI and CI class, in addition to the bulk RMT index $ \beta=1 $
needed to characterize the bulk ELS, the edge RMT index $ \alpha=0,1 $ is also needed to characterize
the lowest energy levels. We also study two- and four- colored hybrid SYK models which show dramatic
different features than all the previous studied hybrid SYK models. We perform Exact diagonization
(ED) in the identified minimum Hilbert space to study both the bulk ELS and the edge exponent ( in the
BDI and CI classes ) and find excellent agreements with our exact maximal symmetry analysis. Our
methods can be easily extended to study the generic imbalanced cases. Our methods and results achieved
may be transferred to the classifications of colored tensor models and also to interacting symmetry
protected topological phases.
