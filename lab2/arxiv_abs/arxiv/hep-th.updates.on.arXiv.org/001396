For every conformal gauge field $h_{\alpha (n)\dot \alpha (m)}$ in four dimensions, with $n\geq
m >0$, a gauge-invariant action is known to exist in arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds. If
the Weyl tensor is non-vanishing, however, gauge invariance holds for a pure conformal field in
the following cases: (i) $n=m=1$ (Maxwell's field) on arbitrary gravitational backgrounds; and
(ii) $n=m+1 =2 $ (conformal gravitino) and $n=m=2$ (conformal graviton) on Bach-flat backgrounds.
It is believed that in other cases certain lower-spin fields must be introduced to ensure gauge invariance
in Bach-flat backgrounds, although no closed-form model has yet been constructed (except for conformal
maximal depth fields with spin $s=5/2$ and $s=3$). In this paper we derive such a gauge-invariant
model describing the dynamics of a conformal pseudo-graviton (described by $h_{\alpha (3)\dot\alpha}$
and $\bar h_{\alpha\dot\alpha(3)}$) coupled to a self-dual two-form. Similar to other conformal
higher-spin theories, it can be embedded in an off-shell superconformal gauge-invariant action.
Specifically, we introduce a new family of $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal gauge multiplets described
by unconstrained prepotentials $\Upsilon_{\alpha(n)}$, with $n>0$, and propose the corresponding
gauge-invariant actions on conformally-flat backgrounds. We demonstrate that the $n=2$ model,
which contains $h_{\alpha(3)\dot{\alpha}}$ at the component level, can be lifted to a Bach-flat
background provided $\Upsilon_{\alpha(2)}$ is coupled to a chiral spinor $\Omega_{\alpha}$.
We also propose families of (super)conformal higher-derivative non-gauge actions and new superconformal
operators in any curved space. Finally, through considerations based on supersymmetry, we argue
that the conformal spin-3 field should always be accompanied by a conformal spin-2 field in order
to ensure gauge invariance in a Bach-flat background.
