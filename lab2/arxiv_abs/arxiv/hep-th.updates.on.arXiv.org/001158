We study the reconstruction of the cosmic rotation power spectrum produced by parity-violating
physics, with an eye to ongoing and near future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such
as BICEP Array, CMBS4, LiteBIRD and Simons Observatory. In addition to the inflationary gravitational
waves and gravitational lensing, measurements of other various effects on CMB polarization open
new window into the early Universe. One of these is anisotropies of the cosmic polarization rotation
which probes the Chern-Simons term generally predicted by string theory. The anisotropies of the
cosmic rotation are also generated by the primordial magnetism and in the Standard Model extention
framework. The cosmic rotation anisotropies can be reconstructed as quadratic in CMB anisotropies.
However, the power of the reconstructed cosmic rotation is a CMB four-point correlation and is not
directly related to the cosmic-rotation power spectrum. Understanding all contributions in the
four-point correlation is required to extract the cosmic rotation signal. Assuming a scale-invariant
rotation spectrum motivated by the inflationary cosmic-rotation models, we employ simulation
to quantify each contribution to the four-point correlation and find that (1) a secondary contraction
of the trispectrum increases the total signal-to-noise, (2) a bias from the lensing-induced trispectrum
is significant compared to the statistical errors in, e.g., LiteBIRD and CMBS4-like experiments,
(3) the use of a realization-dependent estimator decreases the statistical errors by 10%-20%,
depending on experimental specifications, and (4) other higher-order contributions are negligible
at least for near future experiments.
