We construct a model of quantum gravity in which dimension, topology and geometry of spacetime are
dynamical. The microscopic degree of freedom is a real rectangular matrix whose rows label internal
flavours, and columns label spatial sites. In the limit that the size of the matrix is large, the sites
can collectively form a spatial manifold. The manifold is determined from the pattern of entanglement
present across local Hilbert spaces associated with column vectors of the matrix. With no structure
of manifold fixed in the background, the spacetime gauge symmetry is generalized to a group that
includes diffeomorphism in arbitrary dimensions. The momentum and Hamiltonian that generate
the generalized diffeomorphism obey a first-class constraint algebra at the quantum level. In
the classical limit, the constraint algebra of the general relativity is reproduced as a special
case. The first-class nature of the algebra allows one to express the projection of a quantum state
of the matrix to a gauge-invariant state as a path integration of dynamical variables that describe
collective fluctuations of the matrix. The collective variables describe dynamics of emergent
spacetime, where multi-fingered times arise as Lagrangian multipliers that enforce the gauge
constraints. If the quantum state has a local structure of entanglement, a smooth spacetime with
well-defined dimension, topology, signature and geometry emerges at the saddle-point, and the
spin two mode that determines the geometry can be identified. We find a saddle-point solution that
describes a series of (3+1)-dimensional de Sitter-like spacetimes with the Lorentzian signature
bridged by Euclidean spaces in between. Fluctuations of the collective variables are described
by bi-local fields that propagate in the spacetime set up by the saddle-point solution.
