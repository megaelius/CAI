The quantum break-time of a system is the time-scale after which its true quantum evolution departs
from the classical mean field evolution. For capturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical
background - e.g., in terms of a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple
scalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time. Next, we apply these
ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a spin-2 field, which for some time reproduces
the de Sitter metric and simultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum
coherent state of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons turns out to
be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while their frequency is given by the de Sitter
Hubble parameter. In the semi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known properties
of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal Gibbons-Hawking radiation, all
in the language of quantum $S$-matrix scatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most
importantly, this framework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical
treatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite quantum break-time of
the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times $N$. We also point out that the quantum-break
time is inversely proportional to the number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum
break-time imposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes
must have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically acceptable number
of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate this bound if our Universe were $10^{100}$
years old in its entire classical history.
