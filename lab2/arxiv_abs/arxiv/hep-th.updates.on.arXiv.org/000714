The linear theory of massive spin-two field in arbitrary curved background is investigated. In
flat spacetime, the Fierz-Pauli model is well-known as the unique linear theory describing the
massive spin-two field. On the other hand, in order to construct the massive spin-two theory in fixed
curved background with arbitrary metric, infinite series of nonminimal coupling terms are necessary.
In [Nucl. Phys. B 584 (2000) 615], Buchbinder et al. have derived the condition for the ghost-freeness
and they have solved the condition in small curvature approximation. In the leading order approximation,
three free parameters of the leading order nonminimal coupling terms are allowed. However, existence
of the completion corresponding to all the three parameters is not guaranteed. On the other hand,
recently, a class of the completion is obtained by linearizing the dRGT model. However, the leading
order nonminimal coupling terms of the linearized dRGT model depend only on one free parameter.
Therefore, possibility of a class larger than the linearized dRGT model has not been excluded. In
this paper, we develop the method for solving the conditions for ghost freeness in higher order and
investigate whether lower order nonminimal coupling terms can be constrained by higher order conditions
or not. As a result, we obtain an additional constraint on the leading order nonminimal coupling
terms from the fourth order condition. Although the leading order nonminimal coupling terms of
the linearized dRGT model is still a subclass of our resulting nonminimal coupling terms in the leading
order, a trivial extension of the linearized dRGT model is perfectly equivalent to our resulting
action.
