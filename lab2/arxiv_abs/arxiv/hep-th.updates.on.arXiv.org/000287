The Thirring model is a four-fermion theory with a current-current interaction and $U(2N)$ chiral
symmetry. It is closely related to three-dimensional QED and other models used to describe properties
of graphene. In addition it serves as a toy model to study chiral symmetry breaking. In the limit of
flavour number $N \to 1/2$ it is equivalent to the Gross-Neveu model, which shows a parity-breaking
discrete phase transition. The model was already studied with different methods, including Dyson-Schwinger
equations, functional renormalisation group methods and lattice simulations. Most studies agree
that there is a phase transition from a symmetric phase to a spontaneously broken phase for a small
number of fermion flavours, but no symmetry breaking for large $N$. But there is no consensus on the
critical flavour number $N^\text{cr}$ above which there is no phase transition anymore and on further
details of the critical behaviour. Values of $N$ found in the literature vary between $2$ and $7$.
All earlier lattice studies were performed with staggered fermions. Thus it is questionable if
in the continuum limit the lattice model recovers the internal symmetries of the continuum model.
We present new results from lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the Thirring model with SLAC fermions
which exactly implement all internal symmetries of the continuum model even at finite lattice spacing.
If we reformulate the model in an irreducible representation of the Clifford algebra, we find, in
contradiction to earlier results, that the behaviour for even and odd flavour numbers is very different:
For even flavour numbers, chiral and parity symmetry are always unbroken. For odd flavour numbers
parity symmetry is spontaneously broken below the critical flavour number $N_\text{ir}^\text{cr}=9$
while chiral symmetry is still unbroken.
