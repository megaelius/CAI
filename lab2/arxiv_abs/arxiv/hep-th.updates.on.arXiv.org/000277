We investigate the minimal theory of massive gravity (MTMG) recently introduced. After reviewing
the original construction based on its Hamiltonian in the vielbein formalism, we reformulate it
in terms of its Lagrangian in both the vielbein and the metric formalisms. It then becomes obvious
that, unlike previous attempts in the literature of Lorentz-violating massive gravity, not only
the potential but also the kinetic structure of the action is modified from the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley
(dRGT) massive gravity theory. We confirm that the number of physical degrees of freedom in MTMG
is two at fully nonlinear level. This proves the absence of various possible pathologies such as
superluminality, acausality and strong coupling. Afterwards, we discuss the phenomenology of
MTMG in the presence of a dust fluid. We find that on a flat homogeneous and isotropic background we
have two branches. One of them (self-accelerating branch) naturally leads to acceleration without
the genuine cosmological constant or dark energy. For this branch both the scalar and the vector
modes behave exactly as in general relativity (GR). The phenomenology of this branch differs from
GR in the tensor modes sector, as the tensor modes acquire a non-zero mass. Hence, MTMG serves as a
stable nonlinear completion of the self-accelerating cosmological solution found originally
in dRGT theory. The other branch (normal branch) has a dynamics which depends on the time-dependent
fiducial metric. For the normal branch, the scalar mode sector, even though as in GR only one scalar
mode is present (due to the dust fluid), differs from the one in GR, and, in general, structure formation
will follow a different phenomenology. The tensor modes will be massive, whereas the vector modes,
for both branches, will have the same phenomenology as in GR.
