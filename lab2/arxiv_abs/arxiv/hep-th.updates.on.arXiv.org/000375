In this note we characterize the global symmetries for the conjecturally complete collection of
all six dimensional superconformal field theories (6D SCFTs) and provide comprehensive checks
of earlier 6D SCFT classification results via an alternative geometric approach yielding new restrictions
eliminating certain theories. We reach our conclusions by directly constraining Weierstrass
models for elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau (CY) threefolds and bypassing all anomaly cancellation
machinery. This reduces the problem of classifying which 6D SCFT gauge and global symmetries are
realizable in F-theory models before RG-flow to characterizing features of elliptic fibrations
associated to these theories via analysis of polynomials determining their local models. We supply
an algorithm with implementation producing from a given SCFT base an explicit listing of all compatible
gauge enhancements with associated global symmetry maxima consistent with the geometric constraints
we derive, thus making manifest the corresponding geometric ingredients for these symmetries
including any possible Kodaira type realizations of each algebra summand. In mathematical terms,
this amounts to determining all potentially viable non-compact CY threefold elliptic fibrations
at finite distance in the moduli space with Weil-Petersson metric which meet certain requirements
including the transverse pairwise intersection of singular locus components. We provide local
analysis exhausting nearly all CY consistent transverse singular fiber collisions, global analysis
concerning all viable gluings of these local models into larger configurations, and many novel
constraints on such pairwise singular intersections and global fiber arrangements. We also investigate
which transitions between 6D SCFTs can result from gauging of global symmetries and find that continuous
degrees of freedom can be lost during such transitions.
