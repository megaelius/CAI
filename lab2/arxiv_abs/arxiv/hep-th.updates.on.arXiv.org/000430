Despite the seeming simplicity of the theory, calculating (and even defining) entanglement entropy
for the Maxwell theory of a $U(1)$ gauge field in (3+1) dimensions has been the subject of controversy.
It is generally accepted that the ground state entanglement entropy for a region of linear size $L$
behaves as an area law with a subleading logarithm, $S = \alpha L^2 -\gamma \log L$. While the logarithmic
coefficient $\gamma$ is believed to be universal, there has been disagreement about its precise
value. After carefully accounting for subtle boundary corrections, multiple analyses in the high
energy literature have converged on an answer related to the conformal trace anomaly, which is only
sensitive to the local curvature of the partition. In contrast, a condensed matter treatment of
the problem yielded a topological contribution which is not captured by the conformal field theory
calculation. In this perspective piece, we review aspects of the various calculations and discuss
the resolution of the discrepancy, emphasizing the important role played by charged states (the
"extended Hilbert space") in defining entanglement for a gauge theory. While the trace anomaly
result is sufficient for a strictly pure gauge field, coupling the gauge field to dynamical charges
of mass $m$ gives a topological contribution to $\gamma$ which survives even in the $m\rightarrow\infty$
limit. For many situations, the topological contribution from dynamical charges is physically
meaningful and should be taken into account. We also comment on other common issues of entanglement
in gauge theories, such as entanglement distillation, algebraic definitions of entanglement,
and gauge-fixing procedures.
