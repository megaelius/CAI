We examined analytically and proposed a numerical model of an Abelian Higgs dark matter vortex in
the spacetime of a stationary axisymmetric Kerr black hole. In analytical calculations the dark
matter sector was modeled by an addition of a U (1)-gauge field coupled to the visible sector. The
backreaction analysis revealed that the impact of the dark vortex presence is far more complicated
than causing only a deficit angle. The vortex causes an ergosphere shift and the event horizon velocity
is also influenced by its presence. These phenomena are more significant than in the case of a visible
vortex sector. The area of the event horizon of a black hole is diminished and this decline is larger
in comparison to the Kerr black hole with an Abelian Higgs vortex case. After analyzing the gravitational
properties for the general setup, we focused on the subset of models that are motivated by particle
physics. We retained the Abelian Higgs model as a description of the dark matter sector (this sector
contained a heavy dark photon and an additional complex scalar) and added a real scalar representing
the real component of the Higgs doublet in the unitary gauge, as well as an additional U (1)-gauge
field representing an ordinary electromagnetic field. Moreover, we considered two coupling channels
between the visible and dark sectors, which were the kinetic mixing between the gauge fields and
a quartic coupling between the scalar fields. After solving the equations of motion for the matter
fields numerically we analyzed properties of the cosmic string in the dark matter sector and its
influence on the visible sector fields that are directly coupled to it. We found out that the presence
of the cosmic string induced spatial variation in the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field
and a nonzero electromagnetic field around the black hole.
