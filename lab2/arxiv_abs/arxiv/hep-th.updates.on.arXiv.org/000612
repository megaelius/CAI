Studies of dark energy at advanced gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers normally focus on
the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. However, modified gravity theories that predict
a non-trivial dark energy equation of state generically also predict deviations from general relativity
in the propagation of GWs across cosmological distances, even in theories where the speed of gravity
is equal to $c$. We find that, in generic modified gravity models, the effect of modified GW propagation
dominates over that of $w_{\rm DE}(z)$, making modified GW propagation a crucial observable for
dark energy studies with standard sirens. We present a convenient parametrization of the effect
in terms of two parameters $(\Xi_0,n)$, analogue to the $(w_0,w_a)$ parametrization of the dark
energy equation of state, and we give a limit from the LIGO/Virgo measurement of $H_0$ with the neutron
star binary GW170817. We then perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the sensitivity
of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to the cosmological parameters, including $(\Xi_0,n)$, both using
only standard sirens, and combining them with other cosmological datasets. In particular, the
Hubble parameter can be measured with an accuracy better than $1\%$ already using only standard
sirens while, when combining ET with current CMB+BAO+SNe data, $\Xi_0$ can be measured to $0.8\%$
. We discuss the predictions for modified GW propagation of a specific nonlocal modification of
gravity, recently developed by our group, and we show that they are within the reach of ET. Modified
GW propagation also affects the GW transfer function, and therefore the tensor contribution to
the ISW effect.
