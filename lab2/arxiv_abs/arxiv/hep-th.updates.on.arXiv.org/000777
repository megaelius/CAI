We present a general procedure for constructing tensor networks that accurately reproduce holographic
states in conformal field theories (CFTs). Given a state in a large-$N$ CFT with a static, semiclassical
gravitational dual, we build a tensor network by an iterative series of approximations that eliminate
redundant degrees of freedom and minimize the bond dimensions of the resulting network. We argue
that the bond dimensions of the tensor network will match the areas of the corresponding bulk surfaces.
For `tree' tensor networks (i.e., those that are constructed by discretizing spacetime with non-intersecting
Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces), our arguments can be made rigorous using a version of one-shot entanglement
distillation in the CFT. Using the known quantum error correcting properties of AdS/CFT, we show
that bulk legs can be added to the tensor networks to create holographic quantum error correcting
codes. These codes behave similarly to previous holographic tensor network toy models, but describe
actual bulk excitations in continuum AdS/CFT. By assuming some natural generalizations of the
`holographic entanglement of purification' conjecture, we are able to construct tensor networks
for more general bulk discretizations, leading to finer-grained networks that partition the information
content of a Ryu-Takayanagi surface into tensor-factorized subregions. While the granularity
of such a tensor network must be set larger than the string/Planck scales, we expect that it can be
chosen to lie well below the AdS scale. However, we also prove a no-go theorem which shows that the
bulk-to-boundary maps cannot all be isometries in a tensor network with interesecting Ryu-Takayanagi
surfaces.
