We propose, based on the viewpoint that our three-dimensional space is a stack of BPS D3-branes located
at the conifold singularity of the Calabi-Yau three-fold, a new type of self-tuning mechanism in
the framework of the conventional compactifications where the $n$-form fluxes including NS-NS
three-form are all turned off. In this self-tuning mechanism the four-dimensional cosmological
constant $\lambda$ appears as a sum of two types, NS-NS type and R-R type, of vacuum energies on the
brane (or differently, $\lambda$ appears as a brane action density, ${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$) and
these two types of vacuum energies are forced to cancel by field equations so that $\lambda$ tunes
itself to zero as a result. Also in this self-tuning mechanism the $d=4$ supersymmetry is broken
in the brane region, while still maintaining $\lambda =0$. The supersymmetry breaking occurs as
a result of the gauge symmetry breaking of the R-R four-form arising at the quantum level. We also
generalize the above self-tuning mechanism to the case of the flux compactifications where the
fluxes are all turned on to stabilize the moduli. In the generalized theory $\lambda$ appears as
${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$ plus the scalar potential ${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$ for the moduli, in
contrast to the case of the ordinary flux compactifications where $\lambda$ is simply given by ${\mathcal
V}_{\rm scalar}$. Also in this theory any nonzero ${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$ arising from perturbative
or nonperturbative corrections is gauged away by the condition $\lambda=0$, and $\lambda$ is again
expressed only as a brane action density as before, or it simply vanishes by the cancelation between
${\hat I}_{\rm brane}$ and ${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$.
