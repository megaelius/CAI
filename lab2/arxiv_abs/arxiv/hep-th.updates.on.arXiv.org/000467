We analyze the Casimir densities and forces associated with a massive scalar quantum field confined
between two parallel plates in a D-dimensional cosmic string spacetime. The plates are placed orthogonal
to the string and the field obeys the Robin boundary conditions on them. The boundary-induced contributions
are explicitly extracted in the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum
tensor for both single and two plates. The VEV of the energy-momentum tensor, in additional to the
diagonal components, contains an off-diagonal component corresponding to the shear stress. The
latter vanishes on the plates in special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For
points outside the string core the topological contributions in the VEVs are finite on the plates.
Near the string the VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free part, whereas at large distances the
boundary-induced contributions dominate. Due to the nonzero off-diagonal component of the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the normal component, the Casimir forces have nonzero component
parallel to the boundary. Unlike the problem on the Minkowski bulk, the normal forces acting on the
separate plates, in general, do not coincide. Another difference is that in the presence of the cosmic
string the Casimir forces for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions differ. For Dirichlet
case the normal Casimir force does not depend on the curvature coupling parameter. This is not the
case for other boundary conditions. A new qualitative feature induced by the cosmic string is the
appearance of the shear stress acting on the plates. The corresponding force is directed along the
radial coordinate and vanishes for Dirichlet and Neumann cases. Depending on the parameters of
the problem, the radial component of the shear force can be either positive or negative.
