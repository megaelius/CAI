Real-time evolution of replicas of classical field is proposed as an approximate simulator of real-time
quantum field dynamics at finite temperatures. We consider $N$ classical field configurations
dubbed as replicas which interact with each other via the $\tau$-derivative terms and evolve with
the classical equation of motion. The partition function of replicas is found to be proportional
to that of quantum field in the imaginary time formalism. As the replica index $\tau$ can be regarded
as the imaginary time index, the replica evolution is technically the same as the molecular dynamics
part of the hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling and the replica configurations should reproduce the correct
quantum equilibrium distribution after the long-time evolution. At the same time, evolution of
the replica-index average of field variables is described by the classical equation of motion when
the fluctuations are small. In order to examine the real-time propagation properties of replicas,
we first discuss replica evolution in quantum mechanics. Statistical averages of observables
are precisely obtained by the initial condition average of replica evolution, and the time evolution
of the unequal-time correlation function, $\langle x(t) x(t')\rangle$, in a harmonic oscillator
is also described well by the replica evolution in the range $T/\omega > 0.5$. Next, we examine the
statistical and dynamical properties of the $\phi^4$ theory in the 4+1 dimensional spacetime,
which contains three spatial, one replica index or the imaginary time, and one real-time. We note
that the Rayleigh-Jeans divergence can be removed in replica evolution with $N \geq 2$ when the mass
counterterm is taken into account. We also find that the thermal mass obtained from the unequal-time
correlation function at zero momentum grows as a function of the coupling as in the perturbative
estimate in the small coupling region.
