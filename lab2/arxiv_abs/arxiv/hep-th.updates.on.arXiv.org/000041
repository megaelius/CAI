In this paper we investigate the localization and mass spectra of matter fields with spin 0, 1 and
1/2 on a geometric thick brane generated by pure 4D and 5D positive cosmological constants without
bulk scalar fields. This model possesses a 4D cosmological constant that can be made as small as one
desires without fine-tuning it with the bulk cosmological constant. The RS model is obtained as
an analytic continuation of the flat brane limit of this braneworld configuration when the Hubble
parameter disappears. Within this inflating braneworld model it is possible to formulate a mechanism
for obtaining TeV mass scales from Planck ones by adding a positive thin brane, where the Standard
Model fields are trapped, at a distance y_2 from the origin, where the Planck thick brane resides.
The brane separation must be of the same order than the inverse thickness parameter of the model in
order for the mechanism to generate the desired hierarchy. This result is obtained by imposing the
recovery of both the correct 4D gravitational couplings and the actually observed accelerated
expansion of the universe in our de Sitter braneworld. Regarding the localization of matter in the
purely geometric thick braneworld, for spin 0 massless and massive scalar fields as well as for spin
1 vector fields, the potentials of the Kaluza--Klein (KK) modes in thecorresponding Schroedinger
equations are modified Poeschl-Teller potentials, which lead to the localization of the scalar
and vector zero modes on the brane as well as to mass gaps in the mass spectra. We also compute the corrections
to Coulomb's law coming from massive KK vector modes. For spin 1/2 fermions, we introduce the bulk
mass term MF(z)\bar{\Psi}\Psi in the action and show that localization of the massless left-chiral
fermion zero mode is feasible for two mass functions MF(z) with a finite/infinite number of massive
KK bound states.
