We study physical consequences of adding orientifolds to the ABJ triality, which is among 3d N=6
superconformal Chern-Simons theory known as ABJ theory, type IIA string in AdS_4 x CP^3 and N=6 supersymmetric
(SUSY) Vasiliev higher spin theory in AdS_4. After adding the orientifolds, it is known that the
gauge group of the ABJ theory becomes O(N_1)xUSp(2N_2) while the background of the string theory
is replaced by AdS_4 x CP^3/Z_2, and the supersymmetries in the both theories reduce to N=5. We propose
that adding the orientifolds to the N=6 Vasiliev theory leads to N=5 SUSY Vasiliev theory. It turns
out that the N=5 case is more involved because there are two formulations of the N=5 Vasiliev theory
with either O or USp internal symmetry. We show that the two N=5 Vasiliev theories can be understood
as certain projections of the N=6 Vasiliev theory, which we identify with the orientifold projections
in the Vasiliev theory. We conjecture that the O(N_1)xUSp(2N_2) ABJ theory has the two vector model
like limits: N_2 >> N_1 and N_1 >> N_2 which correspond to the semi-classical N=5 Vasiliev theories
with O(N_1) and USp(2N_2) internal symmetries respectively. These correspondences together
with the standard AdS/CFT correspondence comprise the ABJ quadrality among the N=5 ABJ theory,
string/M-theory and two N=5 Vasliev theories. We provide a precise holographic dictionary for
the correspondences by comparing correlation functions of stress tensor and flavor currents.
Our conjecture is supported by various evidence such as agreements of the spectra, one-loop free
energies and SUSY enhancement on the both sides. We also predict the leading free energy of the N=5
Vasiliev theory from the CFT side. As a byproduct, we give a derivation of the relation between the
parity violating phase in the N=6 Vasiliev theory and the parameters in the N=6 ABJ theory, which
was conjectured in arXiv:1207.4485.
