Knowing accurately the late time evolution of the Universe and then finding out the causes for this
evolution are the most demanding challenges of modern cosmology. In this work, we adopt a model independent
approach in view of this debate. We use the cosmographic approach and approximate the Hubble parameter
considering the Pade approximation which works much better than the standard Taylor series approximation
for $z>1$. With this tool, we constrain the late time evolution of the Universe considering low-redshift
observations coming from SNIa, BAO, $H(z)$, $H_{0}$ , strong-lensing time-delay as well as the
Megamaser observations for angular diameter distances. We confirm the tensions with $\Lambda$CDM
model for low-redshifts observations. The present value of the equation of state for the dark energy
has to be phantom-like and, for other redshifts, it has to be either phantom or should have a phantom
crossing. For lower values of $\Omega_{m0}$, multiple phantom crossings are expected. This poses
serious challenges for single, non-interacting scalar field models for dark energy. We also derive
constraints on the {\it statefinders} $(r,s)$ and these constraints show that a single dark energy
model cannot fit data for the whole redshift range $0\leq z\leq 2$: in other words, we need multiple
dark energy behaviors for different redshift ranges. Moreover, the constraint on sound speed for
the total fluid of the Universe, as well as, for the dark energy fluid (assuming that they are barotropic),
rules out the possibility of a barotropic fluid model for unified dark sector as well as barotropic
fluid model for dark energy, as fluctuations in these fluids, are unstable as $c_{s}^2 < 0$ due to
constraints from low-redshift observations.
