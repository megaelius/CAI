We present a comprehensive analysis of the implications of conformal invariance for 3-point functions
of the stress-energy tensor, conserved currents and scalar operators in general dimension and
in momentum space. Our starting point is a novel and very effective decomposition of tensor correlators
which reduces their computation to that of a number of scalar form factors. For example, the most
general 3-point function of a conserved and traceless stress-energy tensor is determined by only
five form factors. Dilatations and special conformal Ward identities then impose additional conditions
on these form factors. The special conformal Ward identities become a set of first and second order
differential equations, whose general solution is given in terms of integrals involving a product
of three Bessel functions (`triple-K integrals'). All in all, the correlators are completely determined
up to a number of constants, in agreement with well-known position space results. We develop systematic
methods for explicitly evaluating the triple-K integrals. In odd dimensions they are given in terms
of elementary functions while in even dimensions the results involve dilogarithms. In some cases,
the triple-K integrals diverge and subtractions are necessary and we show how such subtractions
are related to conformal anomalies. This paper contains two parts that can be read independently
of each other. In the first part, we explain the method that leads to the solution for the correlators
in terms of triple-K integrals and how to evaluate these integrals, while the second part contains
a self-contained presentation of all results. Readers interested only in results may directly
consult the second part of the paper.
