We demonstrate analytically and numerically the existence of geodesically complete singularities
in quintessence and scalar tensor quintessence models with scalar field potential of the form $V(\phi)\sim
\vert \phi\vert^n$ with $0<n<1$. In the case of quintessence, the singularity which occurs at $\phi=0$,
involves divergence of the third time derivative of the scale factor (Generalized Sudden Future
Singularity (GSFS)), and of the second derivative of the scalar field. In the case of scalar-tensor
quintessence with the same potential and with a linear minimal coupling ($F(\phi)=1-\lambda \phi$),
the singularity is stronger and involves divergence of the second derivative of the scale factor
(Sudden Future Singularity (SFS)). We show that the scale factor close to the singularity is of the
form $a(t)=a_s+b(t_{s}-t) + c(t_{s}-t)^2 +d(t_{s}-t)^q$ where $a_s,b,c,d$ are constants obtained
from the dynamical equations and $t_s$ is the time of the singularity. In the case of quintessence
we find $q=n+2$ (ie $2<q<3$), while for the case of scalar-tensor quintessence $q=n+1$ ($1<q<2$).
We verify these analytical results numerically and extend them to the case where a perfect fluid
is present. The linear and quadratic terms in $(t_{s}-t)$ that appear in the expansion of the scale
factor around $t_s$ are subdominant for the diverging derivatives close to the singularity, but
can play an important role in the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Using the analytically derived
relations between these terms, we derive relations involving the Hubble parameter close to the
singularity, which may be used as observational signatures of such singularities in this class
of models. For quintessence with matter fluid, we find that close to the singularity $\dot H=\frac{3}{2}\Omega_{0m}
(1+z_{s})^{3}-3H^{2}$.
