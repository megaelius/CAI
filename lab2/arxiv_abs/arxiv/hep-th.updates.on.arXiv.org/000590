Calculations of $1\to N$ amplitudes in scalar field theories at very high multiplicities exhibit
an extremely rapid growth with the number $N$ of final state particles. This either indicates an
end of perturbative behaviour, or possibly even a breakdown of the theory itself. It has recently
been proposed that in the Standard Model this could even lead to a solution of the hierarchy problem
in the form of a "Higgsplosion". To shed light on this question we consider the quantum mechanical
analogue of the scattering amplitude for $N$ particle production in $\phi^4$ scalar quantum field
theory, which corresponds to transitions $\langle N \lvert \hat{x} \rvert 0 \rangle$ in the anharmonic
oscillator with quartic coupling $\lambda$. We use recursion relations to calculate the $\langle
N \lvert \hat{x} \rvert 0 \rangle$ amplitudes to high order in perturbation theory. Using this we
provide evidence that the amplitude can be written as $\langle N \lvert \hat{x} \rvert 0 \rangle
\sim \exp(F(\lambda N)/\lambda)$ in the limit of large $N$ and $\lambda N$ fixed. We go beyond the
leading order and provide a systematic expansion in powers of $1/N$. We then resum the perturbative
results and investigate the behaviour of the amplitude in the region where tree-level perturbation
theory violates unitarity constraints. The resummed amplitudes are in line with unitarity as well
as stronger constraints derived by Bachas. We generalize our result to arbitrary states and powers
of local operators $\langle N \lvert \hat{x}^q \rvert M \rangle$ and confirm that, to exponential
accuracy, amplitudes in the large $N$ limit are independent of the explicit form of the local operator,
i.e. in our case $q$.
