A new two dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Supersymmetric Non-Linear Sigma Model describes the
dynamics of internal moduli of the BPS semi-local vortex string supported in four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$
SQED. While the core of these strings is very similar to Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices, they
are defined with a characteristic size modulus, much like the instanton lump size. This entails
that the constituting fields of the vortex do not decay exponentially, as one goes far away from the
core of the string, but as a rational function. The appearance of an extra scale in the problem also
allows for an explicit, analytic, approximate solution to be written for the BPS equation, surprisingly.
Despite the conceptually large differences between semi-local and non-Abelian vortices, it appears
that the moduli structures have one main common feature, both undergo the same kind of heterotic
deformation when a supersymmetry breaking potential term is added to the spacetime theory, moving
from $\mathcal{N}=2$ to $\mathcal{N}=1$. By adding a mass term for the gauge scalar multiplet,
a heterotic deformation develops on the worldsheet, which breaks supersymmetry down to $(0,2)$
by coupling supertranslational fermionic zero modes to supersize ones. Such an interaction between
zero modes of two different sectors was already hypothesized and subsequently found for non-Abelian
strings, providing a neat way of circumventing accidental supersymmetry enhancement via Zumino's
theorem. We find that, for small values of the spacetime mass term, an entirely analogous term develops
on the worldsheet of semi-local strings.
