Important properties of a particle, wave or a statistical system depend on the form of a dispersion
relation (DR). Two commonly-discussed dispersion relations are the gapless phonon-like DR and
the DR with the energy or frequency gap. More recently, the third and intriguing type of DR has been
emerging in different areas of physics: the DR with the gap in momentum, or $k$-space. It has been
increasingly appreciated that gapped momentum states (GMS) have important implications for dynamical
and thermodynamic properties of the system. Here, we review the origin of this phenomenon in a range
of physical systems, starting from ordinary liquids to holographic models. We observe how GMS emerge
in the Maxwell-Frenkel approach to liquid viscoelasticity, relate the $k$-gap to dissipation
and observe how the gaps in DR can continuously change from the energy to momentum space and vice versa.
We subsequently discuss how GMS emerge in the two-field description which is analogous to the quantum
formulation of dissipation in the Keldysh-Schwinger approach. We discuss experimental evidence
for GMS, including the direct evidence of gapped DR coming from strongly-coupled plasma. We also
discuss GMS in electromagnetic waves and non-linear Sine-Gordon model. We then move on to discuss
the recently developed quasihydrodynamic framework which relates the $k$-gap with the presence
of a softly broken global symmetry and its applications. Finally, we review recent discussions
of GMS in relativistic hydrodynamics and holographic models. Throughout the review, we point out
essential physical ingredients required by GMS to emerge and make links between different areas
of physics, with the view that new and deeper understanding will benefit from studying the GMS in
seemingly disparate fields and from clarifying the origin of potentially similar underlying physical
ideas and equations.
