Inflation is most often described using quantum field theory (QFT) on a fixed, curved spacetime
background. Such a description is valid only if the spatial volume of the region considered is so
large that its size and shape moduli behave classically. However, if we trace an inflating universe
back to early times, the volume of any comoving region of interest -- for example the present Hubble
volume -- becomes exponentially small. Hence, quantum fluctuations in the trajectory of the background
cannot be neglected at early times. In this paper, we develop a path integral description of a flat,
inflating patch (approximated as de Sitter spacetime), treating both the background scale factor
and the gravitational wave perturbations quantum mechanically. We find this description fails
at small values of the initial scale factor, because \emph{two} background saddle point solutions
contribute to the path integral. This leads to a breakdown of QFT in curved spacetime, causing the
fluctuations to be unstable and out of control. We show the problem may be alleviated by a careful
choice of quantum initial conditions, for the background and the fluctuations, provided that the
volume of the initial, inflating patch is larger than $\gg H^{-1}$ in Planck units with $H$ the Hubble
constant at the start of inflation. The price of the remedy is high: not only the inflating background,
but also the stable, Bunch-Davies fluctuations must be input by hand. Our discussion emphasizes
that, even if the inflationary scale is far below the Planck mass, new physics is required to explain
the initial quantum state of the universe.
