Functional Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation, the central equation of the holographic renormalization
group (HRG), functional Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and generalized Wilson-Polchinski (WP) equation,
the central equation of the functional renormalization group (FRG), are considered in $D$-dimensional
coordinate and abstract (formal) spaces. Instead of extra coordinates or an FRG scale, a holographic
scalar field $\varLambda$ is introduced. The extra coordinate (or scale) is obtained as the amplitude
of delta-field or constant field configurations of $\varLambda$. A rigorous derivation of corresponding
integro-differential equation hierarchies for Green functions (GFs) as well as the integration
formula for functionals are given. Using the integration formula, the functional (arbitrary configuration
of $\varLambda$) solution for the translation-invariant two-particle GF is obtained. For the
delta-field and the constant field configurations of $\varLambda$ this solution is studied in
detail. Separable solution for two-particle GF is briefly discussed. Then, rigorous derivation
of the quantum HJ and the continuity functional equations from the functional Schr\"{o}dinger
equation as well as the semiclassical approximation are given. An iterative procedure for solving
the functional Schr\"{o}dinger equation is suggested. Translation-invariant solutions for
various GFs (both hierarchies) on delta-field configuration of $\varLambda$ are obtained. In
context of continuity equation and open quantum field systems an optical potential is briefly discussed.
Modes coarse graining growth functional for WP functional is analyzed. An approximation scheme
is proposed for the generalized WP equation. With an optimized regulator translation-invariant
solutions for two-particle and four-particle amputated GFs from approximated WP hierarchy are
found analytically.
