Tunnelling processes through black hole horizons have recently been investigated in the framework
of WKB theory discovering interesting interplay with the Hawking radiation. A more precise and
general account of that phenomenon has been subsequently given within the framework of QFT in curved
spacetime by two of the authors of the present paper. In particular, it has been shown that, in the
limit of sharp localization on opposite sides of a Killing horizon, the quantum correlation functions
of a scalar field appear to have thermal nature, and the tunnelling probability is proportional
to $\exp\{-\beta_{Hawking} E\}$. This local result is valid in every spacetime including a local
Killing horizon, no field equation is necessary, while a suitable choice for the quantum state is
relevant. Indeed, the two point function has to verify a short-distance condition weaker than the
Hadamard one. In this paper we consider a massive scalar quantum field with a $\phi^3$ self-interaction
and we investigate the issue whether or not the black hole radiation can be handled at perturbative
level, including the renormalisation contributions. We prove that, for the simplest model of the
Killing horizon generated by the boost in Minkowski spacetime, and referring to Minkowski vacuum,
the tunnelling probability in the limit of sharp localization on opposite sides of the horizon preserves
the thermal form proportional to $\exp\{-\beta_H E\}$ even taking the one-loop renormalisation
corrections into account. A similar result is expected to hold for the Unruh state in the Kruskal
manifold, since that state is Hadamard and looks like Minkowski vacuum close to the horizon.
