We review recent developments in duality symmetric string theory. We begin with the world sheet
doubled formalism which describes strings in an extended space time with extra coordinates conjugate
to winding modes. This formalism is T-duality symmetric and can accommodate non-geometric T-fold
backgrounds which are beyond the scope of Riemannian geometry. Vanishing of the conformal anomaly
of this theory can be interpreted as a set of spacetime equations for the background fields. These
equations follow from an action principle that has been dubbed Double Field Theory (DFT). We review
the aspects of generalised geometry relevant for DFT. We outline recent extensions of DFT and explain
how, by relaxing the so-called strong constraint with a Scherk Schwarz ansatz, one can obtain backgrounds
that simultaneously depend on both the regular and T-dual coordinates. This provides a purely geometric
higher dimensional origin to gauged supergravities that arise from non-geometric compactification.
We then turn to M-theory and describe recent progress in formulating an E_{n(n)} U-duality covariant
description of the dynamics. We describe how spacetime may be extended to accommodate coordinates
conjugate to brane wrapping modes and the construction of generalised metrics in this extend space
that unite the bosonic fields of supergravity into a single object. We review the action principles
for these theories and their novel gauge symmetries. We also describe how a Scherk Schwarz reduction
can be applied in the M-theory context and the resulting relationship to the embedding tensor formulation
of maximal gauged supergravities.
