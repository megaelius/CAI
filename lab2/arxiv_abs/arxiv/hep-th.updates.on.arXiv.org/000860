The stochastic approach aims at describing the long-wavelength part of quantum fields during inflation
by a classical stochastic theory. It is usually formulated in terms of Langevin equations, giving
rise to a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability distribution function of the fields, and possibly
their momenta. The link between these two descriptions is ambiguous in general, as it depends on
an implicit discretisation procedure, the two prominent ones being the It\^o and Stratonovich
prescriptions. Here we show that the requirement of general covariance under field redefinitions
is verified only in the latter case, however at the expense of introducing spurious `frame' dependences.
This stochastic anomaly disappears when there is only one source of stochasticity, like in slow-roll
single-field inflation, but manifests itself when taking into account the full phase space, or
in the presence of multiple fields. Despite these difficulties, we use physical arguments to write
down a covariant Fokker-Planck equation that describes the diffusion of light scalar fields in
non-linear sigma models in the overdamped limit. We apply it to test scalar fields in de Sitter space
and show that some statistical properties of a class of two-field models with derivative interactions
can be reproduced by using a correspondence with a single-field model endowed with an effective
potential. We also present explicit results in a simple extension of the single-field $\lambda
\phi^4$ theory to a hyperbolic field space geometry. The difficulties we describe seem to be the
stochastic counterparts of the notoriously difficult problem of maintaining general covariance
in quantum theories, and the related choices of operator ordering and path-integral constructions.
Our work thus opens new avenues of research at the crossroad between cosmology, statistical physics,
and quantum field theory.
