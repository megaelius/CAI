We prove a conjectured lower bound on $\left< T_{--}(x) \right>_\psi$ in any state $\psi$ of a relativistic
QFT dubbed the Quantum Null Energy Condition (QNEC). The bound is given by the second order shape
deformation, in the null direction, of the geometric entanglement entropy of an entangling cut
passing through $x$. Our proof involves a combination of the two independent methods that were used
recently to prove the weaker Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC). In particular the properties
of modular Hamiltonians under shape deformations for the state $\psi$ play an important role, as
do causality considerations. We study the two point function of a "probe" operator $\mathcal{O}$
in the state $\psi$ and use a lightcone limit to evaluate this correlator. Instead of causality in
time we consider \emph{causality in modular time} for the modular evolved probe operators, which
we constrain using Tomita-Takesaki theory as well as certain generalizations pertaining to the
theory of modular inclusions. The QNEC follows from very similar considerations to the derivation
of the chaos bound and the causality sum rule. We use a kind of defect Operator Product Expansion to
apply the replica trick to these modular flow computations, and the displacement operator plays
an important role. Our approach was inspired by the AdS/CFT proof of the QNEC which follows from properties
of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface near the boundary of AdS, combined with the requirement of entanglement
wedge nesting. Our methods were, as such, designed as a precise probe of the RT surface close to the
boundary of a putative gravitational/stringy dual of \emph{any} QFT with an interacting UV fixed
point. We also prove a higher spin version of the QNEC.
