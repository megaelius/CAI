Distinct quantum vacua of topologically ordered states can be tunneled into each other via extended
operators. The possible applications include condensed matter and quantum cosmology. We present
a straightforward approach to calculate the partition function on various manifolds and ground
state degeneracy (GSD), mainly based on continuum/cochain Topological Quantum Field Theories
(TQFT), in any dimension. This information can be related to the counting of extended operators
of bosonic/fermionic TQFT. On the lattice scale, anyonic particles/strings live at the ends of
line/surface operators. Certain systems in different dimensions are related to each other through
dimensional reduction schemes, analogous to decategorification. Examples include spin TQFTs
derived from gauging the interacting fermionic symmetry protected topological states of group
$\mathbb{Z}_4\times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^f$ and $(\mathbb{Z}_4)^2 \times\mathbb{Z}_2^f$
in 3+1D, also $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^f$ and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^f$
in 2+1D. We consider situations where a TQFT lives on (1) a closed spacetime or (2) a spacetime with
boundary, such that the bulk and boundary are fully-gapped and short or long-range entangled (SRE/LRE).
Anyonic excitations can be deconfined on the boundary. We introduce new exotic topological interfaces
on which neither particle nor string excitations alone condensed, but only fuzzy-composite objects
of extended operators can end (e.g. a string-like composite object formed by a set of particles can
end on a special 2+1D boundary of 3+1D bulk). We explore the relations between group extension constructions
and partially breaking constructions (e.g. 0-form/higher-form/composite breaking) of topological
boundaries, after gauging. We comment on the implications of entanglement entropy for some of such
LRE systems.
