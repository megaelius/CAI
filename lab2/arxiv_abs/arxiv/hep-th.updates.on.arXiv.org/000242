It has been shown that bosonic symmetry-protected-trivial (SPT) phases with pure gauge anomalous
boundary can all be realized via non-linear $\sigma$-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) of the symmetry group
$G$ with various topological terms. Those SPT phases (called the pure SPT phases) can be classified
by group cohomology ${\cal H}^d(G,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$. But there are also SPT phases beyond
${\cal H}^d(G,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$ with mixed gauge-gravity anomalous boundary (which
will be called the mixed SPT phases). In this paper, we show that the bosonic mixed SPT phases can be
realized by $G\times SO(\infty)$ NL$\sigma$Ms with various topological terms. Through the group
cohomology ${\cal H}^d[G\times SO(\infty),\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}]$, we find that the set of
our constructed SPT phases in $d$-dimensional space-time (denoted as $\text{LSPT}_G^d$) are
given by $\text{LSPT}_G^d= E^d(G)\rtimes \oplus_{k=1}^{d-1} {\cal H}^k(G,\text{iTO}_L^{d-k})\oplus
{\cal H}^d(G,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) $ where $G$ may contain time-reversal. Here $\text{iTO}_L^d$
is the set of the topologically-ordered phases in $d$-dimensional space-time that have no topological
excitations. We find that $\text{iTO}_L^1=\text{iTO}_L^2=\text{iTO}_L^4=\text{iTO}_L^6=0$,
$\text{iTO}_L^3=\mathbb{Z}$, $\text{iTO}_L^5=\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\text{iTO}_L^7=2\mathbb{Z}$.
Some of the mixed SPT states were also referred as the beyond-group-cohomology SPT states. We see
that those beyond-group-cohomology SPT states are actually within another type of group cohomology
classification. Our construction also gvies us the topological terms that fully characterize
the corresponding SPT and iTO phases. Through several examples, we show how can the universal physical
properties of SPT phases be obtained from those topological terms.
