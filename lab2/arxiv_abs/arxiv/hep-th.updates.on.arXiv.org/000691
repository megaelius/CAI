In this thesis I present numerical studies of entanglement entropy and the quantum null energy condition
in strongly coupled far-from-equilibrium quantum states using holography. I give a careful introduction
into the numerical methods used and provide the computer codes to compute entanglement entropy
and the quantum null energy condition. These methods are then applied to systems of various degrees
of complexity, including homogeneous and isotropic far- from-equilibrium quantum quenches dual
to Vaidya spacetimes, to homogeneous and anisotropic finite temperature states dual to anisotropic
black brane geometries, and to inhomogeneous and anisotropic states of colliding walls of energy
dual to gravitational shock wave collisions in Anti-de Sitter space. For all these scenarios I compute
the fully non-linear dynamics of the dual geometry, which requires to numerically solve five-dimensional
Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant and asymptotic Anti-de Sitter boundary
conditions. The numerical solutions for the geometries allow to extract the time evolution of the
holographic energy momentum tensor and provides the background for computing two-point functions,
entanglement entropy and the quantum null energy condition. From the anisotropic system one learns
that the near-equilibrium dynamic of entanglement entropy has an accurate description in terms
of quasinormal modes. In the shock wave system I identify characteristic features of entanglement
entropy that allow to discriminate between thick and narrow shocks. All my numerical studies confirm
the quantum null energy condition, also the shock wave system, which itself can violate the classical
null energy condition for sufficiently narrow shocks. My results also show that the quantum null
energy condition can saturate in the far-from-equilibrium regime.
