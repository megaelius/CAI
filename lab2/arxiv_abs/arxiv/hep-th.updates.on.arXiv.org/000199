The emergent gauge theories are reconsidered in light of supersymmetry and an appropriate emergence
conjecture is formulated. Accordingly, it might be expected that only global symmetries are fundamental
symmetries of Nature, whereas local symmetries and associated massless gauge fields could solely
emerge due to spontaneous breaking of underlying spacetime symmetries involved, such as relativistic
invariance and supersymmetry. We further argue that this breaking, taken in the form of the nonlinear
sigma-model type pattern for vector fields or superfields, puts essential restrictions on geometrical
degrees of freedom of a physical field system that makes it to adjust itself in such a way that its global
internal symmetry G turns into the local symmetry G_{loc}. Remarkably, this emergence process
may naturally be triggered by supersymmetry, as is illustrated in detail by an example of a general
supersymmetric QED model which is then extended to the Standard Model and GUTs. The requirement
of vacuum stability in such class of models makes both Lorentz invariance and supersymmetry to become
spontaneously broken in the visible sector. As a consequence, massless photon and other gauge bosons
appear as the corresponding Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone zero modes and special local invariance
is simultaneously generated. Due to this invariance all possible Lorentz violations are turned
out to be completely cancelled out among themselves. However, broken supersymmetry effects related
to an existence of a light pseudo-goldstino (being essentially a photino) are still left in the theory.
It typically appears in the low-energy particle spectrum as the eV scale stable LSP or the electroweak
scale long-lived NLSP, being in both cases accompanied by a very light gravitino, that could be considered
as some observational signature in favor of emergent supersymmetric theories.
