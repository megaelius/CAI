We investigate possible regimes in spatially flat vacuum cosmological models in cubic Lovelock
gravity. The spatial section is a product of three- and extra-dimensional isotropic subspaces.
This is the second paper of the series and we consider D=5 and general D>=6 cases here. For each D case
we found critical values for $\alpha$ (Gauss-Bonnet coupling) and $\beta$ (cubic Lovelock coupling)
which separate different dynamical cases and study the dynamics in each region to find all regimes
for all initial conditions and for arbitrary values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The results suggest
that for D>=3 there are regimes with realistic compactification originating from `generalized
Taub' solution. The endpoint of the compactification regimes is either anisotropic exponential
solution (for $\alpha > 0$, $\mu \equiv \beta/\alpha^2 < \mu_1$ (including entire $\beta < 0$))
or standard Kasner regime (for $\alpha > 0$, $\mu > \mu_1$). For D>=8 there is additional regime which
originates from high-energy (cubic Lovelock) Kasner regime and ends as anisotropic exponential
solution. It exists in two domains: $\alpha > 0$, $\beta < 0$, $\mu \leqslant \mu_4$ and entire $\alpha
> 0$, $\beta > 0$. Let us note that for D>=8 and $\alpha > 0$, $\beta < 0$, $\mu < \mu_4$ there are two realistic
compactification regimes which exist at the same time and have two different anisotropic exponential
solutions as a future asymptotes. For D>=8 and $\alpha > 0$, $\beta > 0$, $\mu < \mu_2$ there are two
realistic compactification regimes but they lead to the same anisotropic exponential solution.
This behavior is quite different from the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet case. There are two more unexpected
observations among the results -- all realistic compactification regimes exist only for $\alpha
> 0$ and there is no smooth transition from high-energy Kasner regime to low-energy one with realistic
compactification.
