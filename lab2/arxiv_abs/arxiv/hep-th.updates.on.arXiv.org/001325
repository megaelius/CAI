We present a new method for calculating Renyi entanglement entropies for fermionic field-theories
originating from microscopic Hamiltonians. The method builds on an operator identity which we
discover for the first time. The identity leads to the representation of traces of operator products,
and thus Renyi entropies of a subsystem, in terms of fermionic-displacement operators. This allows
for a very transparent path-integral formulation, both in and out-of-equilibrium, having a simple
boundary condition on the fermionic fields. The method is validated by reproducing well known expressions
for entanglement entropy in terms of the correlation matrix for non-interacting fermions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the method by explicitly formulating the field theory for Renyi entropy in
a few zero and higher-dimensional large-$N$ interacting models based on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) model, and for the Hubbard model within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approximation.
We use the formulation to compute Renyi entanglement entropy of interacting Fermi liquid (FL) and
non-Fermi liquid (NFL) states in the large-$N$ models and compare successfully with the results
obtained via exact diagonalization for finite $N$. We elucidate the connection between entanglement
entropy and residual entropy of the NFL ground state in the SYK model and extract sharp signatures
of quantum phase transition in the entanglement entropy across an NFL to FL transition. Furthermore,
we employ the method to obtain nontrivial system-size scaling of entanglement in an interacting
diffusive metal described by a chain of SYK dots.
