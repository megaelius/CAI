For a long time, the predictive limits of perturbative quantum field theory have been limited by
our inability to carry out loop calculations to arbitrarily high order, which become increasingly
complex as the order of perturbation theory is increased. This problem is exacerbated by the fact
that perturbation series derived from loop diagram (Feynman diagram) calculations represent
asymptotic (divergent) series which limits the predictive power of perturbative quantum field
theory. Here, we discuss an ansatz which could overcome these limits, based on the observations
that (i) for many phenomenologically relevant field theories, one can derive dispersion relations
which relate the large-order growth (the asymptotic limit of "infinite loop order") with the imaginary
part of arbitrary correlation functions, for negative coupling ("unstable vacuum"), and (ii)
one can analyze the imaginary part for negative coupling in terms of classical field configurations
(instantons). Unfortunately, the perturbation theory around instantons, which could lead to
much more accurate predictions for the large-order behavior of Feynman diagrams, poses a number
of technical as well as computational difficulties. Here, we study, to further the above mentioned
ansatz, correlation functions in a one-dimensional (1D) field theory with a quartic self-interaction
and an O(N) internal symmetry group, otherwise known as the 1D N-vector model. Our focus is on corrections
to the large-order growth of perturbative coefficients, i.e., the limit of a large number of loops
in the Feynman diagram expansion. We evaluate, in momentum space, the two-loop corrections for
the two-point correlation function, and its derivative with respect to the momentum, as well as
the two-point correlation function with a wigglet insertion. Also, we study the four-point function.
