Light-Front Hamiltonian theory, derived from the quantization of the QCD Lagrangian at fixed light-front
time \tau = t+z/c, provides a rigorous frame-independent framework for solving nonperturbative
QCD. The eigenvalues of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian predict the hadronic mass spectrum, and
the eigensolutions provide the light-front wavefunctions describing hadron structure. The valence
Fock-state wavefunctions of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian satisfy a single-variable relativistic
equation of motion, analogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schrodinger equation, with an effective
confining potential U which systematically incorporates the effects of higher quark and gluon
Fock states. The potential U has a unique form if one requires that the action for zero quark mass remains
conformally invariant. The holographic mapping of gravity in AdS space to QCD with a specific soft-wall
dilaton yields the same light-front Schrodinger equation. It also gives a precise relation between
the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension z of AdS space and the boost-invariant light-front
wavefunctions describing the internal structure of hadrons in physical space-time. The elastic
and transition form factors of the pion and the nucleons are found to be well described in this framework.
The predictions include a zero-mass pion in the chiral limit, and linear Regge trajectories with
the same slope in the radial quantum number n and orbital angular momentum L. The light-front AdS/QCD
holographic approach thus gives a frame-independent representation of color-confining dynamics
and the excitation spectra of light-quark hadrons in terms of a single mass parameter. We also discuss
the implications of the underlying conformal template of QCD for renormalization scale-setting
and the implications of light-front quantization for the value of the cosmological constant.
