We present a new set of boundary conditions for General Relativity on AdS$_3$, where the dynamics
of the boundary degrees of freedom are described by two independent left and right members of the
Gardner hierarchy of integrable equations, also known as the "mixed KdV-mKdV" hierarchy. This
integrable system has the very special property that simultaneously combines both, the Korteweg-de
Vries (KdV) and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) hierarchies in a single integrable structure.
This relationship between gravitation in three-dimensional spacetimes and two-dimensional
integrable systems is based on an extension of the recently introduced "soft hairy boundary conditions"
on AdS$_3$, where the chemical potentials are now allowed to depend locally on the dynamical fields
and their spatial derivatives. The complete integrable structure of the Gardner system, i.e.,
the phase space, the Poisson brackets and the infinite number of commuting conserved charges, are
directly obtained from the asymptotic analysis and the conserved surface integrals in the gravitational
theory. These boundary conditions have the particular property that they can also be interpreted
as being defined in the near horizon region of spacetimes with event horizons. Black hole solutions
are then naturally accommodated within our boundary conditions, and are described by static configurations
associated to the corresponding member of the Gardner hierarchy. The thermodynamic properties
of the black holes in the ensembles defined by our boundary conditions are also discussed. Finally,
we show that our results can be naturally extended to the case of a vanishing cosmological constant,
and the integrable system turns out to be precisely the same as in the case of AdS$_3$.
