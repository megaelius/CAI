We revise the cosmological standard model presuming that matter, i.e. baryons and cold dark matter,
exhibits a non-vanishing pressure mimicking the cosmological constant effects. In particular,
we propose a scalar field Lagrangian $\mathcal L_1$ for matter with the introduction of a Lagrange
multiplier as constraint. We also add a symmetry breaking effective potential accounting for the
classical cosmological constant problem, by adding a second Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_2$. Investigating
the Noether current due to the shift symmetry on the scalar field, $\varphi\rightarrow\varphi+c^0$,
we show that $\mathcal{L}_1$ turns out to be independent from the scalar field $\varphi$. Further
we find that a positive Helmotz free-energy naturally leads to a negative pressure without introducing
by hand any dark energy term. To face out the fine-tuning problem, we investigate two phases: before
and after transition due to the symmetry breaking. We propose that during transition dark matter
cancels out the quantum field vacuum energy effects. This process leads to a negative and constant
pressure whose magnitude is determined by baryons only. The numerical bounds over the pressure
and matter densities are in agreement with current observations, alleviating the coincidence
problem. Finally assuming a thermal equilibrium between the bath and our effective fluid, we estimate
the mass of the dark matter candidate. Our numerical outcomes seem to be compatible with recent predictions
on WIMP masses, for fixed spin and temperature. In particular, we predict possible candidates whose
masses span in the range $0.5-1.7$ TeV.
