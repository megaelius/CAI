Many strongly coupled field theories admit a spectrum of gauge-invariant bound states that includes
scalar particles with the same quantum numbers as the vacuum. The challenge naturally arises of
how to characterise them. In particular, how can a dilaton---the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson
associated with approximate scale invariance---be distinguished from other generic light scalars
with the same quantum numbers? We address this problem within the context of gauge-gravity dualities,
by analysing the fluctuations of the higher-dimensional gravitational theory. The diagnostic
test that we propose consists of comparing the results of the complete calculation, performed by
using gauge-invariant fluctuations in the bulk, with the results obtained in the probe approximation.
While the former captures the mixing between scalar and metric degrees of freedom, the latter removes
by hand the fluctuations that source the dilatation operator of the boundary field-theory. Hence,
the probe approximation cannot capture a possible light dilaton, while it should fare well for other
scalar particles. We test this idea on a number of holographic models, among which are some of the
best known, complete gravity backgrounds constructed within the top-down approach to gauge-gravity
dualities. We compute the spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations, that are interpreted as bound
states (glueballs) of the dual field theory, and we highlight those cases in which the probe approximation
yields results close to the correct physical ones, as well as those cases where significant discrepancies
emerge. We interpret the latter occurrence as an indication that identifying one of the lightest
scalar states with the dilaton is legitimate, at least as a leading-order approximation.
