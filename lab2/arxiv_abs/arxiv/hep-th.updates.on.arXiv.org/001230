The quantum theories of boson and fermion fields with quadratic nonstationary Hamiltoanians are
rigorously constructed. The representation of the algebra of observables is given by the Hamiltonian
diagonalization procedure. The sufficient conditions for the existence of unitary dynamics at
finite times are formulated and the explicit formula for the matrix elements of the evolution operator
is derived. In particular, this gives the well-defined expression for the one-loop effective action.
The ultraviolet and infrared divergencies are regularized by the energy cutoff in the Hamiltonian
of the theory. The possible infinite particle production is regulated by the corresponding counterdiabatic
terms. The explicit formulas for the average number of particles $N_D$ recorded by the detector
and for the probability $w(D)$ to record a particle by the detector are derived. It is proved that
these quantities allow for the regularization removal limit and, in this limit, $N_D$ is finite
and $w(D)\in[0,1)$. As an example, the theory of a neutral boson field with stationary quadratic
part of the Hamiltonian and nonstationary source is considered. The average number of particles
produced by this source from the vacuum during a finite time evolution and the inclusive probability
to record a created particle are obtained. The infrared and ultraviolet asymptotics of the average
density of created particles are derived. As a particular case, quantum electrodynamics with a
classical current is considered. The ultraviolet and infrared asymptotics of the average number
of photons are derived. The asymptotics of the average number of photons produced by the adiabatically
driven current is found.
