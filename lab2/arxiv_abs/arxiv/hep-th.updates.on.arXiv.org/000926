The local higher-derivative interactions that enter into the low-energy expansion of the effective
action of type IIB superstring theory with constant complex modulus generally violate the $U(1)$
R-symmetry of IIB supergravity by $q_U$ units. These interactions have coefficients that transform
as non-holomorphic modular forms under $SL(2, {\mathbb Z})$ transformations with holomorphic
and anti-holomorphic weights $(w,-w)$, where $q_U=-2w$. In this paper $SL(2, {\mathbb Z})$-covariance
and supersymmetry are used to determine first-order differential equations on moduli space that
relate the modular form coefficients of classes of BPS-protected maximal $U(1)$-violating interactions
that arise at low orders in the low-energy expansion. These are the moduli-dependent coefficients
of BPS interactions of the form $d^{2p} \mathcal{P}_n$ in linearised approximation, where $\mathcal{P}_n$
is the product of $n$ fields that has dimension $=8$ with $q_U=8-2n$, and $p=0$, $2$ or $3$. These
first-order equations imply that the coefficients satisfy $SL(2, {\mathbb Z})$-covariant Laplace
eigenvalue equations on moduli space with solutions that contain information concerning perturbative
and non-perturbative contributions to superstring amplitudes. For $p=3$ and $n\ge 6$ there are
two independent modular forms, one of which has a vanishing tree-level contribution. The analysis
of super-amplitudes for $U(1)$-violating processes involving arbitrary numbers of external
fluctuations of the complex modulus leads to a diagrammatic derivation of the first-order differential
relations and Laplace equations satisfied by the coefficient modular forms. Combining this with
a $SL(2, {\mathbb Z})$-covariant soft axio-dilaton limit that relates amplitudes with different
values of $n$ determines most of the modular invariant coefficients, leaving a single undetermined
constant.
