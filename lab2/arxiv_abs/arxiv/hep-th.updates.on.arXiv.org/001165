Several recent papers have shown a close relationship between entanglement wedge reconstruction
and the unitarity of black hole evaporation in AdS/CFT. The analysis of these papers however has
a rather puzzling feature: all calculations are done using bulk dynamics which are essentially
those Hawking used to predict information loss, but applying ideas from entanglement wedge reconstruction
seems to suggest a Page curve which is consistent with information conservation. Why should two
different calculations in the same model give different answers for the Page curve? In this note
we present a new pair of models which clarify this situation. Our first model gives a holographic
illustration of unitary black hole evaporation, in which the analogue of the Hawking radiation
purifies itself as expected, and this purification is reproduced by the entanglement wedge analysis.
Moreover a smooth black hole interior persists until the last stages the evaporation process. Our
second model gives an alternative holographic interpretation of the situation where the bulk evolution
leads to information loss: unlike in the models proposed so far, this bulk information loss is correctly
reproduced by the entanglement wedge analysis. This serves as an illustration that quantum extremal
surfaces are in some sense kinematic: the time-dependence of the entropy they compute depends on
the choice of bulk dynamics. In both models no bulk quantum corrections need to be considered: classical
extremal surfaces are enough to do the job. We argue that our first model is the one which gives the
right analogy for what actually happens to evaporating black holes, but we also emphasize that any
complete resolution of the information problem will require an understanding of non-perturbative
bulk dynamics.
