The Standard Model (SM) Higgs Lagrangian is straightforwardly rewritten into a version of the nonlinear
sigma model $G/H=$ $[SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R]/SU(2)_{V}$ $\simeq O(4)/O(3)$, with the (approximate)
scale symmetry realized nonlinearly by the (pseudo) dilaton (= Higgs). It is further gauge equivalent
to that having the symmetry $O(4)_{\rm global} \times O(3)_{\rm local}$, with $O(3)_{\rm local}$
being the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS). In a scale-invariant version of the Grassmannian model $G/H=$
$O(N)/[O(N-3)\times O(3)] $ $\simeq O(N)_{\rm global}\times [O(N-3)\times O(3)]_{\rm local}$
identical to the SM for $N \rightarrow 4$, we show that the kinetic term of the HLS gauge bosons $\rho_\mu$
of the $O(3)_{\rm local}\simeq [SU(2)_V]_{\rm local}$ are dynamically generated in the large
$N$ limit by the nonperturbative dynamics of the SM itself. Irrespectively of the scale symmetry,
all the "$a=2$ results" for the generic HLS Lagrangian ${\cal L}_A+ a {\cal L}_V$, i.e., $\rho$-universality,
KSRF relations and the vector meson dominance, are realized independently of the parameter "$a$"
in the large $N$ dynamics. While the classical equation of motion for $\rho_\mu$ is violated by the
contact term proportional to $1/a$, it is recovered in the $a\rightarrow \infty$ limit where the
$\rho_\mu$ in the kinetic term is totally replaced by the corresponding composite operator, resulting
in the Skyrme term, which stabilizes the skyrmion as a dark matter within the SM. We also have the second
order phase phase transition to the unbroken phase of $O(4)_{\rm global}\times O(3)_{\rm local}$,
which has massless HLS gauge bosons $\rho_\mu$ and massive $\pi$ (no longer NG bosons), while both
becoming massless free particles just on the transition point (scale-invariant ultraviolet fixed
point). The results have direct relevance to the 2-flavored QCD.
