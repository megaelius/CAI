Quasi-topological terms in gravity can be viewed as those that give no contribution to the equations
of motion for a special subclass of metric ans\"atze. They therefore play no r\^ole in constructing
these solutions, but can affect the general perturbations. We consider Einstein gravity extended
with Ricci tensor polynomial invariants, which admits Einstein metrics with appropriate effective
cosmological constants as its vacuum solutions. We construct three types of quasi-topological
gravities. The first type is for the most general static metrics with spherical, toroidal or hyperbolic
isometries. The second type is for the special static metrics where $g_{tt} g_{rr}$ is constant.
The third type is the linearized quasi-topological gravities on the Einstein metrics. We construct
and classify results that are either dependent on or independent of dimensions, up to the tenth order.
We then consider a subset of these three types and obtain Lovelock-like quasi-topological gravities,
that are independent of the dimensions. The linearized gravities on Einstein metrics on all dimensions
are simply Einstein and hence ghost free. The theories become quasi-topological on static metrics
in one specific dimension, but non-trivial in others. We also focus on the quasi-topological Ricci
cubic invariant in four dimensions as a specific example to study its effect on holography, including
shear viscosity, thermoelectric DC conductivities and butterfly velocity. In particular, we
find that the holographic diffusivity bounds can be violated by the quasi-topological terms, which
can induce an extra massive mode that yields a butterfly velocity unbound above.
