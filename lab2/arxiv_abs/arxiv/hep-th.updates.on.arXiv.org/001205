I review applications of superconformal algebra. light-front holography, and an extended form
of conformal symmetry to hadron spectroscopy and dynamics. QCD is not supersymmetrical in the traditional
sense -- the QCD Lagrangian is based on quark and gluonic fields -- not squarks nor gluinos. However,
its hadronic eigensolutions conform to a representation of superconformal algebra. and provide
a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and tetraquarks with a universal Regge slope. The
pion $q \bar q$ eigenstate is composite but yet has zero mass for $m_q=0.$ Light-Front Holography
also predicts the form of the nonperturbative QCD running coupling in agreement with the effective
charge determined from measurements of the Bjorken sum rule. One also obtains viable predictions
for hadron dynamics such as spacelike and timelike hadronic form factors, structure functions,
distribution amplitudes, and transverse momentum distributions. The combined approach of light-front
holography and superconformal algebra also provides insight into the origin of the QCD mass scale
and color confinement. A key tool is the dAFF principle which shows how a mass scale can appear in the
Hamiltonian and the equations of motion while retaining the conformal symmetry of the action. When
one applies the dAFF procedure to chiral QCD, a mass scale $\kappa$ appears which determines the
hadron masses in the absence of the Higgs coupling. The result is an extended conformal symmetry
which has a conformally invariant action even though an underlying mass scale appears in the Hamiltonian.
Although conformal symmetry is strongly broken by the heavy quark mass, the supersymmetric mechanism,
which transforms mesons to baryons (and baryons to tetraquarks), still holds and gives remarkable
mass degeneracies across the spectrum of light, heavy-light and double-heavy hadrons.
