In this second of two articles, we study a system of 2N+3 linear homogeneous second-order partial
differential equations (PDEs) in 2N variables that arise in conformal field theory (CFT) and multiple
Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE). In CFT, these are null-state equations and Ward identities.
They govern partition functions central to the characterization of a statistical cluster or loop
model such as percolation, or more generally the Potts models and O(n) models, at the statistical
mechanical critical point in the continuum limit. (SLE partition functions also satisfy these
equations.) The partition functions for critical lattice models contained in a polygon P with 2N
sides exhibiting a free/fixed side-alternating boundary condition are proportional to the CFT
correlation function <psi_1^c(w_1) psi_1^c(w_2) ... psi_1^c(w_{2N-1}) psi_1^c(w_{2N})>^P,
where the w_i are the vertices of P and psi_1^c is a one-leg corner operator. Partition functions
conditioned on crossing events in which clusters join the fixed sides of P in some specified connectivity
are also proportional to this correlation function. When conformally mapped onto the upper half-plane,
methods of CFT show that this correlation function satisfies the system of PDEs that we consider.
This article is the second of two papers in which we completely characterize the space of all solutions
for this system of PDEs that grow no faster than a power-law. In the first article, we proved, to within
a precise conjecture, that the dimension of this solution space is no more than C_N, the Nth Catalan
number. In this article, we use those results to prove that if the mentioned conjecture is true, then
this solution space has dimension C_N and is spanned by solutions that can be constructed with the
CFT Coulomb gas (contour integral) formalism.
