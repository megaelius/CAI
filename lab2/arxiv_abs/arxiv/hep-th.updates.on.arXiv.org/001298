In this work we revisit the topological mass generation of 2-forms and establish a connection to
the unique derivative coupling arising in the quartic Lagrangian of the systematic construction
of massive $2-$form interactions, relating in this way BF theories to Galileon-like theories of
2-forms. In terms of a massless $1-$form $A$ and a massless $2-$form $B$, the topological term manifests
itself as the interaction $B\wedge F$, where $F = {\rm d} A$ is the field strength of the $1-$form.
Such an interaction leads to a mechanism of generation of mass, usually referred to as "topological
generation of mass" in which the single degree of freedom propagated by the $2-$form is absorbed
by the $1-$form, generating a massive mode for the $1-$form. Using the systematical construction
in terms of the Levi-Civita tensor, it was shown that, apart from the quadratic and quartic Lagrangians,
Galileon-like derivative self-interactions for the massive 2-form do not exist. A unique quartic
Lagrangian $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma}_{\;\;\;\;\;\;\sigma}\partial_{\mu}B_{\alpha\rho}\partial_{\nu}B_{\beta\gamma}$
arises in this construction in a way that it corresponds to a total derivative on its own but ceases
to be so once an overall general function is introduced. We show that it exactly corresponds to the
same interaction of topological mass generation. Based on the decoupling limit analysis of the
interactions, we bring out supporting arguments for the uniqueness of such a topological mass term
and absence of the Galileon-like interactions. Finally, we discuss some preliminary applications
in cosmology.
