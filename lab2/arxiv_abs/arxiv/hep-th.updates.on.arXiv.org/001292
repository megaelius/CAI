Considered is the direct ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD (i.e. supersymmetric QCD) - like $\Phi$-theory with
$SU(N_c)$ colors and $3N_c/2< N_F<2N_c$ flavors of light quarks ${\overline Q}^{\,b}_j,\,Q^i_a,\,
a,b=1...N_c,\,\, i,j=1...N_F$, with small mass parameter $0< m_Q\ll\Lambda_Q$ in the superpotential.
Besides, it includes $N^2_F$ additional colorless but flavored fields $\Phi_{i}^{j}$, with the
large mass parameter $\mu_{\Phi}\gg\Lambda_Q$, interacting with quarks through the Yukawa coupling
in the superpotential. In parallel, is considered its Seiberg's dual variant, i.e. the $d\Phi$-theory
with $(N_F-N_c)$ dual colors and $3N_c/2< N_F<2N_c$ flavors of dual quarks ${\overline q}_{d}^{\,j},\,{q}_i^c,\,
c,d=1...(N_F-N_c)$. The multiplicities of various vacua and values of the quark and gluino condensates
in all vacua are found. It is shown that in considered vacua of both the direct and dual theories the
quarks are in the conformal regimes at scales $\mu<\Lambda_Q$. The dynamics of these regimes is
sufficiently simple and well understood, so that no additional dynamical assumptions were needed
to calculate the mass spectra in sections 4 and 5. It is shown that the mass spectra of the direct $\Phi$
and dual $d\Phi$ - theories are different, in disagreement with the Seiberg hypothesis about complete
equivalence of such two theories. Besides it is shown in the direct $\Phi$-theory that a qualitatively
new phenomenon takes place: the seemingly heavy and dynamically irrelevant fields $\Phi$ `return
back' and there appear two additional generations of light $\Phi$-particles with small masses
$\mu^{\rm pole}_{2,3}(\Phi)\ll\Lambda_Q$.
