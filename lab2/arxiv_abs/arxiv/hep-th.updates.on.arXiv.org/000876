We describe the extension, beyond fundamental representations of the Yang-Baxter algebra, of
our new construction of separation of variables basis for quantum integrable lattice models. The
key idea underlying our approach is to use the commuting conserved charges of the quantum integrable
models to generate the basis in which their spectral problem is $separated$, i.e. in which the wave
functions are factorized in terms of specific solutions of a functional equation. For the so-called
"non-fundamental" models we construct two different SoV basis. The first is given from the fundamental
quantum Lax operator having isomorphic auxiliary and quantum spaces and that can be obtained by
fusion of the original quantum Lax operator. The construction essentially follows the one we used
previously for fundamental models and allows us to derive the simplicity and diagonalizability
of the transfer matrix spectrum. Then, starting from the original quantum Lax operator and using
the full tower of the fused transfer matrices, we introduce a second SoV basis for which the proof
of the separation of the transfer matrix spectrum is naturally derived. We show that, under some
special choice, this second SoV basis coincides with the one associated to the Sklyanin's approach.
Moreover, we derive the finite difference type (quantum spectral curve) functional equation and
the set of its solution defining the complete transfer matrix spectrum. This is explicitly implemented
for the integrable quantum models associated to the higher spin representations of the general
quasi-periodic $Y(gl_{2})$ Yang-Baxter algebra. Our SoV approach also leads to the construction
of a $Q$-operator in terms of the fused transfer matrices. Finally, we show that the $Q$-operator
family can be equivalently used as the family of commuting conserved charges enabling to construct
our SoV basis.
