Recent insights into the conceptual structure of localization in QFT ("modular localization")
led to clarifications of old unsolved problems. The oldest one is the Einstein-Jordan conundrum
which led Jordan in 1925 to the discovery of quantum field theory. This comparison of fluctuations
in subsystems of heat bath systems (Einstein) with those resulting from the restriction of the QFT
vacuum state to an open subvolume (Jordan) leads to a perfect analogy; the globally pure vacuum state
becomes upon local restriction a strongly impure KMS state. This phenomenon of localization-caused
thermal behavior as well as the vacuum-polarization clouds at the causal boundary of the localization
region places localization in QFT into a sharp contrast with quantum mechanics and justifies the
attribute "holstic". In fact it positions the E-J Gedankenexperiment into the same conceptual
category as the cosmological constant problem and the Unruh Gedankenexperiment. The holistic
structure of QFT resulting from "modular localization" also leads to a revision of the conceptual
origin of the crucial crossing property which entered particle theory at the time of the bootstrap
S-matrix approach but suffered from incorrect use in the S-matrix settings of the dual model and
string theory. The new holistic point of view, which strengthens the autonomous aspect of QFT, also
comes with new messages for gauge theory by exposing the clash between Hilbert space structure and
localization and presenting alternative solutions based on the use of stringlocal fields in Hilbert
space. Among other things this leads to a radical reformulation of the Englert-Higgs symmetry breaking
mechanism.
