The variety of consistent "gauging" deformations of supergravity theories in four dimensions
depends on the choice of Lagrangian formulation. One important goal is to get the most general deformations
without making hidden assumptions. Ignoring supersymmetry we consider in this paper $n_v$ abelian
vector potentials in four spacetime dimensions with non-minimal kinetic coupling to $n_s$ uncharged
(possibly nonlinear) scalar fields. As in the case of extended supergravities, one model may possess
different formulations related by $Sp(2n_v,\mathbb{R})$. The symplectic group mixes its electric
and magnetic potentials. The model admits a global duality symmetry subgroup $G$ which acts also
on the scalars. We recall first how the general second order Lagrangian, its local deformations
and those of its abelian gauge group will depend on the choice of $2n_v$ directions (choice of "Darboux
frame"). We start from a general frame defined by the symplectic transformation relating it to a
fixed"reference" one. Combinations of symplectic matrix coefficients appear then as constant
parameters in the second order Lagrangians. Another gauging method uses an "embedding tensor"
that characterizes the realization of the gauge group via the global duality group. It involves
additional 2-form gauge fields. A suitable zero charge limit of this realization has abelian gauge
group and the "gauging" can be viewed as a consistent deformation of that limit. We show that the two
methods applied to the corresponding ungauged models have equivalent local deformations -- and
more generally, have isomorphic local BRST cohomology at all ghost numbers. We finally consider
manifestly duality invariant first order actions with abelian gauge group. We point out that obstructions
to non-abelian deformations of the Yang-Mills type exhibited in a previous work remain present
when couplings to scalar fields are included.
