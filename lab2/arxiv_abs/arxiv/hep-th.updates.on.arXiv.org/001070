In this paper, we study the geometries given by commuting pairs of generalized endomorphisms ${\cal
A} \in \text{End}(T\oplus T^*)$ with the property that their product defines a generalized metric.
There are four types of such commuting pairs: generalized K\"ahler (GK), generalized para-K\"ahler
(GpK), generalized chiral and generalized anti-K\"ahler geometries. We show that GpK geometry
is equivalent to a pair of para-Hermitian structures and we derive the integrability conditions
in terms of these. From the physics point of view, this is the geometry of $2D$ $(2,2)$ twisted supersymmetric
sigma models. The generalized chiral structures are equivalent to a pair of tangent bundle product
structures that also appear in physics applications of $2D$ sigma models. We show that the case when
the two product structures anti-commute corresponds to Born geometry. Lastly, the generalized
anti-K\"ahler structures are equivalent to a pair of anti-Hermitian structures (sometimes called
Hermitian with Norden metric). The generalized chiral and anti-K\"ahler geometries do not have
isotropic eigenbundles and therefore do not admit the usual description of integrability in terms
of the Dorfman bracket. We therefore use an alternative definition of integrability in terms of
the generalized Bismut connection of the corresponding metric, which for GK and GpK commuting pairs
recovers the usual integrability conditions and can also be used to define the integrability of
generalized chiral and anti-K\"ahler structures. In addition, it allows for a weakening of the
integrability condition, which has various applications in physics.
