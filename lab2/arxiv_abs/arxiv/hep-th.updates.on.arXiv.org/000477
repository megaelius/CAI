At thermal equilibrium, the concept of effective central charge for massive deformations of two-dimensional
conformal field theories (CFT) is well understood, and can be defined by comparing the partition
function of the massive model to that of a CFT. This temperature-dependent effective charge interpolates
monotonically between the central charge values corresponding to the IR and UV fixed points at low
and high temperatures, respectively. We propose a non-equilibrium, time-dependent generalization
of the effective central charge for integrable models after a quantum quench, $c_{\rm eff}(t)$,
obtained by comparing the return amplitude to that of a CFT quench. We study this proposal for a large
mass quench of a free boson, where the charge is seen to interpolate between $c_{\rm eff}=0$ at $t=0$,
and $c_{\rm eff}\sim 1$ at $t\to\infty$, as is expected. We use our effective charge to define an
"Ising to Tricritical Ising" quench protocol, where the charge evolves from $c_{\rm eff}=1/2$
at $t=0$, to $c_{\rm eff}=7/10$ at $t\to\infty$, the corresponding values of the first two unitary
minimal CFT models. We then argue that the inverse "Tricritical Ising to Ising" quench is impossible
with our methods. These conclusions can be generalized for quenches between any two adjacent unitary
minimal CFT models. We finally study a large mass quench into the "staircase model" (sinh-Gordon
with a particular complex coupling). At short times after the quench, the effective central charge
increases in a discrete "staircase" structure, where the values of the charge at the steps can be
computed in terms of the central charges of unitary minimal CFT models. When the initial state is
a pure state, one always finds that $c_{\rm eff}(t\to\infty)\geq c_{\rm eff}(t=0)$, though $c_{\rm
eff}(t)$, generally oscillates at finite times. We explore how this constraint may be related to
RG flow irreversibility.
