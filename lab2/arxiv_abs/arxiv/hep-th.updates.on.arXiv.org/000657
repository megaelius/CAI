Graphene has a remarkable low energy spectrum described by an effective Dirac model, whose interest
resides in its ability to account for a wealth of fundamental aspects specific to massless Dirac
fermions. Significant interest has lately been devoted to the study of vacancies obtained by removing
a neutral carbon atom. The presence of a single vacancy has interesting and unexpected consequences.
It leads to the occurrence of a stable charge of order unity localised at the vacancy site and interacting
with other charges of the conductor by means of an unscreened Coulomb potential. It also breaks the
symmetry between the two triangular graphene sublattices hence inducing zero energy states at
the Dirac point. These features have been noticed, however, their precise underlying mechanism
and its relation to Dirac physics, if any, are yet to be investigated. Here we show the fractional
and pseudo-scalar nature of this stable vacancy charge originating from the vacuum and insensitive
to screening effects. A continuous Dirac model is presented which relates zero modes to vacuum fractional
charge and to a parity anomaly. This relation, constitutes an Index theorem and is achieved by using
particular chiral boundary conditions which map the vacancy problem onto edge state physics and
link zero energy states to topological features of the bulk alike the Hall effect or physics of kinks,
vortices and monopoles. Vacancies in graphene thus allow to realise prominent features of $2+1$
quantum electrodynamics, e.g., charge fractionalisation and parity symmetry breaking, but without
coupling to a gauge field. This essential difference makes vacancy physics relatively easy to implement
and an interesting playground for topological switching and computation.
