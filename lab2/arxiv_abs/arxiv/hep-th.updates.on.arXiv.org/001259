We probe the low-temperature behavior of a system of quantum bouncers as a theoretical model for
ultracold neutrons within a low energy modified version of the standard quantum mechanics. Working
in one dimension, the energy spectrum and stationary states of the system are obtained via an infrared
modified Hamiltonian within the WKB approximation. In this manner, we can study energy levels of
a system of ultracold neutrons as an important probe towards exploring the low energy manifestation
of quantum gravitational effects. Our calculated energy levels of ultracold neutrons are in accordance
with the observed energy levels, as obtained in the famous Nesvizhevsky \emph{et al.} experiment,
except one level difference. Upon this difference, our results show that the ground state energy
of the system is very close to zero compared with the observed value in the Nesvizhevsky \emph{et
al.} experiment. Except this one level difference, there is an obvious agreement between our calculated
results and the mentioned experimental results. We also show that there is a displacement in the
location of the peaks of probability density functions of the stationary states towards zero, leading
to more overall compactness of the peaks. Then we tackle modified thermodynamics of a system of quantum
bouncers in the infrared regime via an ensemble theory and through a numerical analysis both in one
dimension and also three dimensions. While the issue of dimensional reduction has been essentially
assigned to the high energy regime, here we show that there is a trace of dimensional reduction in
infrared regime with one important difference: in the high energy regime, the dimensional reduction
occurs effectively from $D=3$ to $D=1$, but here in this low energy regime, there is a trace of dimensional
reduction from $D=3$ to $D=2$.
