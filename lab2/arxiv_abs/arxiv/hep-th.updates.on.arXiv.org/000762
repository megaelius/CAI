We discuss the connection between Weyl$^2$ supergravity and superstrings and further discuss
holography between 4-dimensional, ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal Weyl$^2$ supergravity and ${\cal
N}=8$, higher spin-four theory on $AdS_5$. The Weyl$^2$ plus Einstein supergravity theory is a
special kind of a bimetric gravity theory and consists of a massless graviton multiplet plus an additional
massive spin-two supermultiplet. Here, we argue that the additional spin-two field and its superpartners
originate from massive excitations in the open string sector; just like the ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
gauge fields, they are localized on the world volume of D3-branes. The ghost structure of the Weyl
action should be considered as an artifact of the truncation of the infinitely many higher derivative
terms underlying the massive spin 2 action. In field theory, ${\cal N}=4$ Weyl$^2$ supergravity
exhibits superconformal invariance in the limit of vanishing Planck mass. In string theory the
additional spin-two fields become massless in the tensionless limit. Therefore low string scale
scenarios with large extra dimensions provide (almost) superconformal field theories with almost
massless open string spin-two fields. The full ${\cal N}=4$ scalar potential including the Yang-Mills
matter multiplets is presented and the supersymmetric vacua of Einstein Supergravity are shown,
as expected, to be vacua of massive Weyl supergravity. Other vacua are expected to exist which are
not vacua of Einstein supergravity. Finally, we identify certain spin-four operators on the 4-dimensional
boundary theory that could be the holographic duals of spin-four fields in the bulk.
