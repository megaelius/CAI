The relativistic Dirac equation in four-dimensional spacetime reveals a coherent relation between
the dimensions of spacetime and the degrees of freedom of fermionic spinors. A massless Dirac fermion
generates new symmetries corresponding to chirality spin and charge spin as well as conformal scaling
transformations. With the introduction of intrinsic W-parity, a massless Dirac fermion can be
treated as a Majorana-type or Weyl-type spinor in a six-dimensional spacetime that reflects the
intrinsic quantum numbers of chirality spin. A generalized Dirac equation is obtained in the six-dimensional
spacetime with a maximal symmetry. Based on the framework of gravitational quantum field theory
proposed in Ref. \cite{YLWU} with the postulate of gauge invariance and coordinate independence,
we arrive at a maximally symmetric gravitational gauge field theory for the massless Dirac fermion
in six-dimensional spacetime. Such a theory is governed by the local spin gauge symmetry SP(1,5)
and the global Poincar\'e symmetry P(1,5)= SO(1,5)$\ltimes P^{1,5} $ as well as the charge spin
gauge symmetry SU(2). The theory leads to the prediction of doubly electrically charged bosons.
A scalar field and conformal scaling gauge field are introduced to maintain both global and local
conformal scaling symmetries. A generalized gravitational Dirac equation for the massless Dirac
fermion is derived in the six-dimensional spacetime. The equations of motion for gauge fields are
obtained with conserved currents in the presence of gravitational effects. The dynamics of the
gauge-type gravifield as a Goldstone-like boson is shown to be governed by a conserved energy-momentum
tensor, and its symmetric part provides a generalized Einstein equation of gravity. An alternative
geometrical symmetry breaking mechanism for the mass generation of Dirac fermions is demonstrated.
