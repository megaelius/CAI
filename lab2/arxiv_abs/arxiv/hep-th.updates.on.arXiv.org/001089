Reduced density matrices are a powerful tool in the analysis of entanglement structure, approximate
or coarse-grained dynamics, decoherence, and the emergence of classicality. It is straightforward
to produce a reduced density matrix with the partial-trace map by ``tracing out'' part of the quantum
state, but in many natural situations this reduction may not be achievable. We investigate the general
problem of identifying how the quantum state reduces given a restriction on the observables. For
example, in an experimental setting, the set of observables that can actually be measured is usually
modest (compared to the set of all possible observables) and their resolution is limited. In such
situations, the appropriate state-reduction map can be defined via a generalized bipartition,
which is associated with the structure of irreducible representations of the algebra generated
by the restricted set of observables. One of our main technical results is a general, not inherently
numeric, algorithm for finding irreducible representations of matrix algebras. We demonstrate
the viability of this approach with two examples of limited--resolution observables. The definition
of quantum state reductions can also be extended beyond algebras of observables. To accomplish
this task we introduce a more flexible notion of bipartition, the partial bipartition, which describes
coarse-grainings preserving information about a limited set (not necessarily algebra) of observables.
We describe a variational method to choose the coarse-grainings most compatible with a specified
Hamiltonian, which exhibit emergent classicality in the reduced state space. We apply this construction
to the concrete example of the 1-D Ising model. Our results have relevance for quantum information,
bulk reconstruction in holography, and quantum gravity.
