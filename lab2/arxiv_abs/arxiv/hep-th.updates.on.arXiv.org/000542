We numerically investigate a lattice regularized version of quantum electrodynamics in one spatial
dimension (Schwinger model). We work at a density where lattice commensuration effects are important,
and preclude analytic solution of the problem by bosonization. We therefore numerically investigate
the interplay of confinement, lattice commensuration, and disorder, in the form of a random chemical
potential. We begin by pointing out that the ground state at commensurate filling spontaneously
breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice. This feature is absent in the conventional lattice
regularization, which breaks the relevant symmetry explicitly, but is present in an alternative
(symmetric) regularization that we introduce. Remarkably, the spontaneous symmetry breaking
survives the addition of a random chemical potential (which explicitly breaks the relevant symmetry)
in apparent contradiction of the Imry-Ma theorem, which forbids symmetry breaking in one dimension
with this kind of disorder. We identify the long range interaction as the key ingredient enabling
the system to evade Imry-Ma constraints. We examine spatially resolved energy level statistics
for the disordered system, and demonstrate that the low energy Hilbert space exhibits ergodicity
breaking, with level statistics that fail to follow random matrix theory. A careful examination
of the structure of low lying excited states reveals that disorder induced localization is responsible
for the deviations from random matrix theory, and further reveals that the elementary excitations
are charge neutral, and therefore not long range interacting.
