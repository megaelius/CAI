Nowadays the term 'sign problem' is used to identify two different problems. The ideas to overcome
the first type of the 'sign problem' of strongly oscillating complex valued imtegrand in the Feynman
path integrals comes from Picard-Lefschetz theory and a complex version of Morse theory. The main
idea is to select Lefschetz thimbles as the cycle approaching the critical point at the path-integration,
where the imaginary part of the complex action stays constant. Since the imaginary part of the action
is constant on each thimble, the sign problem disappears and the integral can be calculated much
more effectively. Here based on the Metropolis -- Hastings algorithm a new method of calculations
of the integral of the strongly oscillating integrands has been prosed. Some simple test calculation
and comparison with available analytical results have been carried out. The second type of the 'sign
problem' arises at studies Fermi systems by path integral approach and is caused by the requirement
of antisymmetrization of the real valued matrix elements of the density matrix. An explicit analytical
expression for effective pair pseudopotential in phase space has been discussed in Wigner formulation
of quantum mechanics. Obtained pseudopotential allow to account for Fermi statistical effects
as realizes the Pauli blocking of fermions due to the repulsion between identical fermions, which
prevents their occupation of same phase space cell. To test this approach, calculations of the momentum
distribution function of the ideal system of Fermi particles have been presented over a wide range
of momentum and degeneracy parameter.
