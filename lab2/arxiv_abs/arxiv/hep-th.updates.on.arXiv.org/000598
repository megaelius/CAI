The soft bootstrap is an on-shell method to constrain the landscape of effective field theories
(EFTs) of massless particles via the consistency of the low-energy S-matrix. Given assumptions
on the on-shell data (particle spectra, linear symmetries, and low-energy theorems), the soft
bootstrap is an efficient algorithm for determining the possible consistency of an EFT with those
properties. The implementation of the soft bootstrap uses the recently discovered method of soft
subtracted recursion. We derive a precise criterion for the validity of these recursion relations
and show that they fail exactly when the assumed symmetries can be trivially realized by independent
operators in the effective action. We use this to show that the possible pure (real and complex) scalar,
fermion, and vector exceptional EFTs are highly constrained. Next, we prove how the soft behavior
of states in a supermultiplet must be related and illustrate the results in extended supergravity.
We demonstrate the power of the soft bootstrap in two applications. First, for the $\mathcal{N}
= 1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\mathbb{CP}^1$ nonlinear sigma models, we show that on-shell constructibility
establishes the emergence of accidental IR symmetries. This includes a new on-shell perspective
on the interplay between $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, low-energy theorems, and electromagnetic
duality. Second, we study Galileon theories, including aspects of supersymmetrization, the possibility
of a vector-scalar Galileon EFT, and the existence of higher-derivative corrections preserving
the enhanced special Galileon symmetry. The latter is addressed both by soft bootstrap and by application
of double-copy / KLT relations applied to higher-derivative corrections of chiral perturbation
theory.
