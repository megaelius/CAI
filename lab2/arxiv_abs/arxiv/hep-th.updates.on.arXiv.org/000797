The `problem of time' remains an unresolved issue in all known physical descriptions of the Universe.
One aspect of this problem is the conspicuous absence of time in the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, which
is the analogue of the Schrodinger equation for the Universal wavefunction. Page and Wootters famously
addressed this problem by providing a mechanism for effectively introducing time evolution into
this timeless cosmological picture. Their method, which is sometimes called the conditional probability
interpretation (CPI), requires the identification of an internal clock system that is meant to
keep time for the remainder of the Universe. Most investigations into this idea employ the idealized
limit of a non-interacting clock system, the so-called ideal clock. However, by allowing for interactions,
we have found the counter-intuitive result that a non-interacting clock is not necessarily the
optimal choice, even if it is `ideal'. In particular, the uncertainty that is associated with the
physical measurement of an atomic clock is found to decrease monotonically as the interactions
grow stronger. This observation, which is reinforced by a previous study using a semi-classical
clock, paves the way to an independent argument that is based on the energy conservation of any isolated
system. Our conclusion is that ideal clocks must be prohibited from the CPI when recovering cosmological
time evolution. Interactions are necessary for describing time evolution as a strict matter of
principle. Lastly, we also consider the implications of this result for the experience of time in
the evolution of the Universe.
