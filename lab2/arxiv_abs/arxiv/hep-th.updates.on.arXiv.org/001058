The AdS/CFT correspondence is one of the most important discoveries in theoretical physics in recent
years. It states that certain quantum mechanical theories can actually be described by classical
gravity in one higher dimension, in a spacetime called anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. What makes this
duality so useful is that it relates theories with weak coupling to theories with strong coupling
and thus provides a new tool for tackling strongly coupled quantum field theories, which are notoriously
difficult to handle using conventional methods. During the course of my PhD I have mostly studied
time dependent processes, in particular thermalization processes, in quantum field theories
using the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the gravity side, this is dual to dynamical formation of black
holes from the collapse of matter fields. By studying the gravitational collapse process in detail,
we can then draw conclusions about the dynamical formation of a thermal state in the dual quantum
field theory. Using mostly numerical methods, I have studied how confinement affects thermalization
in quantum field theories, where the system may never thermalize and field theory observables undergo
interesting quasiperiodic behaviour. I have also studied formation of black holes in three dimensions
which due to the simplified nature of three-dimensional gravity can be done using analytical methods.
This has led to the discovery of new solutions of three-dimensional gravity corresponding to the
formation of black holes without spherical symmetry, which can provide a deeper understanding
of thermalization in two-dimensional quantum field theories. In a third line of research, I have
studied higher spin gravity in three dimensions, an exotic extension of three-dimensional gravity
which includes fields with spin higher than two, and we outline a new method to construct black hole
solutions carrying higher spin charge.
