In 1927 Einstein sent two brief communications to the Prussian Academy of Sciences on Kaluza's five-dimensional
theory. In his Einstein biography, Abraham Pais asserted that he could not understand the reasons
that pushed Einstein to communicate his work. Indeed, Einstein's paper seems to be very close to
Klein's approach, published in 1926. The question seems to be yet unanswered, also in recent works.
The idea of adding a new space-like dimension fascinated Einstein for a long period with oscillating
enthusiasm. We review his 1927 brief communications and we propose a reinterpretation of his papers.
We argue that Einstein's work contains some fundamental innovations and that a deeper analysis
shows the differences between Einstein's and Kaluza's approaches. Firstly, Einstein realized
that Kaluza's cylinder condition admitted a covariant formulation. Secondly he explicitly tried
to use Weyl's scale invariance in order to construct a theory covering the macroscopic as well the
microscopic phenomena. In constructing a five-dimensional action, Einstein used in a modern way,
the idea of `gauge invariance'. We argue that he did not undergo the mistake of setting as constant
the fifth component of the five-dimensional metric. We urge that Einstein knew Klein's work and
that he did not mention Klein's and Fock's contributions in his first communication because he was
trying to construct a new approach to the five-dimensional Universe. Furthermore, we reiterate
that he cited them in the second part, when he realized that he failed his attempt. We found a new implementation
of Einstein's idea in the Seventies.
