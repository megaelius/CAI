We investigate Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions in the Schroedinger representation. The Schroedinger
picture is interesting because it is well suited to explore properties of the vacuum state in the
non-perturbative regime. Yet, not much analytical work has been done on this subject, and even the
topic of perturbation theory in the Schroedinger representation is not well developed, especially
in the case of gauge theories. In a paper by Hatfield [Phys.Lett.B 147, 435 (1984)] the vacuum wave
functional for SU(2) theory was computed to O(e). In the non-perturbative regime, the most sophisticated
analytical approach has been developed by Karabali et al. in a series of papers (see [Nucl.Phys.B
824, 387 (2010)] and references therein). This thesis aims to put perturbation theory in the Schroedinger
representation on more solid ground by computing the vacuum wave functional for a general gauge
group SU$(N_c)$ up to O$(e^2)$, utilizing modifications of these two methods. This is important
since it provides us with a tool for testing non-perturbative approaches, which should reproduce
the perturbative result in an appropriate limit. Furthermore, regularization and renormalization
are also not well understood in the Schroedinger picture. The regularization method proposed by
Karabali et al. leads to conflicting results when applied to the computation of the vacuum wave functional
with the two different methods mentioned above. We aim to clarify how regularization should be implemented
and develop a new regularization approach, which brings these two expressions into agreement,
providing a strong check of the regularization employed. We argue that this regularization procedure
is not specific to the cases studied here. It should be applied in the same way to any quantum field
theory in any dimension in the Schroedinger picture.
