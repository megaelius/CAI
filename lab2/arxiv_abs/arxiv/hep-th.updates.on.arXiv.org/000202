We establish a connection between the ultra-Planckian scattering amplitudes in field and string
theory and unitarization by black hole formation in these scattering processes. Using as a guideline
an explicit microscopic theory in which the black hole represents a bound-state of many soft gravitons
at the quantum critical point, we were able to identify and compute a set of perturbative amplitudes
relevant for black hole formation. These are the tree-level N-graviton scattering S-matrix elements
in a kinematical regime (called classicalization limit) where the two incoming ultra-Planckian
gravitons produce a large number N of soft gravitons. We compute these amplitudes by using the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye
relations, as well as scattering equations and string theory techniques. We discover that this
limit reveals the key features of the microscopic corpuscular black hole N-portrait. In particular,
the perturbative suppression factor of a N-graviton final state, derived from the amplitude, matches
the non-perturbative black hole entropy when N reaches the quantum criticality value, whereas
final states with different value of N are either suppressed or excluded by non-perturbative corpuscular
physics. Thus we identify the microscopic reason behind the black hole dominance over other final
states including non-black hole classical object. In the parameterization of the classicalization
limit the scattering equations can be solved exactly allowing us to obtain closed expressions for
the high-energy limit of the open and closed superstring tree-level scattering amplitudes for
a generic number N of external legs. We demonstrate matching and complementarity between the string
theory and field theory in different large-s and large-N regimes.
