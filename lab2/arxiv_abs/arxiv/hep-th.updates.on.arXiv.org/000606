In R. R. Cuzinatto, et.al, Phys. Rev. D 93, 124034 (2016), it has been demonstrated that theories
of gravity in which the Lagrangian includes terms depending on the scalar curvature $R$ and its derivatives
up to order $n$, i.e. $f\left(R,\nabla_{\mu}R,\nabla_{\mu_{1}}\nabla_{\mu_{2}}R,...,\nabla_{\mu_{1}}...\nabla_{\mu_{n}}R\right)$
theories of gravity, are equivalent to scalar-multi-tensorial theories in Jordan frame. In particular,
in the metric and Palatini formalisms, this scalar-multi-tensorial equivalent scenario shows
an structure that resembles that of Brans-Dicke theories with a kinetic term for the scalar field
with $\omega_{0}=0$ or $\omega_{0}=-3/2$, respectively. In the present work, the aforementioned
analyzis is extended to Einstein frame. The conformal transformation of the metric characterizing
the transformation from Jordan's to Einstein frame is responsible for decoupling the scalar field
from the scalar curvature and also for introducing a usual kinetic term for the scalar field in the
metric formalism, while in the Palatini approach, this kinetic term is absent in the action. Concerning
the other tensorial auxiliary fields, they appear in the theory through a generalized potential.
As an example, the analyzis of an extension of Starobinsky model (with a extra term proportional
to $\nabla_{\mu}R\nabla^{\mu}R$) is performed and the fluid representation for the energy-momentum
tensor is considered. In the metric formalism, the presence of the extra term causes the fluid to
be an imperfect fluid with a heat flux contribution; on the other hand, in the Palatini formalism
the effective energy-momentum tensor for the extended Starobinsky gravity is that of a perfect
fluid type.
