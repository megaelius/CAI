In the formulation of his celebrated Formality conjecture, M. Kontsevich introduced a universal
version of the deformation theory for the Schouten algebra of polyvector fields on affine manifolds.
This universal deformation complex takes the form of a differential graded Lie algebra of graphs,
denoted $\mathsf{fGC}_2$, together with an injective morphism towards the Chevalley-Eilenberg
complex associated with the Schouten algebra. The latter morphism is given by explicit local formulas
making implicit use of the supergeometric interpretation of the Schouten algebra as the algebra
of functions on a graded symplectic manifold of degree $1$. The ambition of the present series of
works is to generalise this construction to graded symplectic manifolds of arbitrary degree $n\geq1$.
The corresponding graph model is given by the full Kontsevich graph complex $\mathsf{fGC}_d$ where
$d=n+1$ stands for the dimension of the associated AKSZ type $\sigma$-model. This generalisation
is instrumental to classify universal structures on graded symplectic manifolds. In particular,
the zeroth cohomology of the full graph complex $\mathsf{fGC}_{d}$ is shown to act via $\mathsf{Lie}_\infty$-automorphisms
on the algebra of functions on graded symplectic manifolds of degree $n$. This generalises the known
action of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"{u}ller algebra $\mathfrak{grt}_1\simeq H^0(\mathsf{fGC}_2)$
on the space of polyvector fields. This extended action can in turn be used to generate new universal
deformations of Hamiltonian functions, generalising Kontsevich flows on the space of Poisson
manifolds to differential graded manifolds of higher degrees. As an application of the general
formalism, new universal flows on the space of Courant algebroids are presented.
