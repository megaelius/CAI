We study Maxwell's equation as a theory for smooth $k$-forms on globally hyperbolic spacetimes
with timelike boundary as defined by Ak\'e, Flores and Sanchez. In particular we start by investigating
on these backgrounds the D'Alembert - de Rham wave operator $\Box_k$ and we highlight the boundary
conditions which yield a Green's formula for $\Box_k$. Subsequently, we characterize the space
of solutions of the associated initial and boundary value problem under the assumption that advanced
and retarded Green operators do exist. This hypothesis is proven to be verified by a large class of
boundary conditions using the method of boundary triples and under the additional assumption that
the underlying spacetime is ultrastatic. Subsequently we focus on the Maxwell operator. First
we construct the boundary conditions which entail a Green's formula for such operator and then we
highlight two distinguished cases, dubbed $\delta\mathrm{d}$-tangential and $\delta\mathrm{d}$-normal
boundary conditions. Associated to these we introduce two different notions of gauge equivalence
and we prove that in both cases, every equivalence class admits a representative abiding to the Lorentz
gauge. We use this property and the analysis of the operator $\Box_k$ to construct and to classify
the space of gauge equivalence classes of solutions of the Maxwell's equations with the prescribed
boundary conditions. As a last step and in the spirit of future applications in the framework of algebraic
quantum field theory, we construct the associated unital $*$-algebras of observables proving
in particular that, as in the case of the Maxwell operator on globally hyperbolic spacetimes with
empty boundary, they possess a non-trivial center.
