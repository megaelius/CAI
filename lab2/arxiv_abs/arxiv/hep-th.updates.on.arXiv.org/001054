In this paper, we study the 6d Little String Theory (LST) (the decoupled theory on the worldvolume
of $N$ NS5-branes) on curved manifolds, by using its holographic duality to Type II string theory
in asymptotically linear dilaton backgrounds. We focus on backgrounds with a large number of Killing
vectors (namely, products of maximally symmetric spaces), without requiring supersymmetry (we
do not turn on any background fields except the metric). LST is non-local so it is not obvious which
spaces it can be defined on; we show that holography implies that the theory cannot be put on negatively
curved spaces, but only on spaces with zero or positive curvature. For example, one cannot put LST
on a product of an anti-de Sitter space times another space, without turning on extra background
fields. On spaces with positive curvature, such as $S^6$, $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^4$, $S^3\times
S^3$, etc., we typically find (for large $N$) dual holographic backgrounds which are weakly coupled
and weakly curved everywhere, so that they can be well-described by Type II supergravity. In some
cases more than one smooth solution exists for LST on the same space, and they all contribute to the
partition function. We also study the thermodynamical properties of LST compactified on spheres,
finding the leading correction to the Hagedorn behavior of the spectrum, which is different on curved
space than on flat space. We discuss the holographic renormalization procedure, which must be implemented
in order to get a finite free energy for the LST; we do not know how to implement it for general spaces,
but we can (and we do) implement it for the theory compactified on $S^4$.
