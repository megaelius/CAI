The pseudo-conformal field theory (PCFT) is a 4-d action, which depends on the lorentzian Cauchy-Riemann
(LCR) structure, like the 2-d Polyakov action. The gauge field has a special confining propagator,
therefore it must be identified with the gluon field. The tetrad of the LCR-structure defines a class
of metrics and a corresponding class of self dual 2-forms. The metric generates the Einstein gravity.
In the linearized Einstein gravity approximation, the Bianchi identities permit the definition
of the conserved energy-momentum and angular momentum quantities. A massive and a massless LCR-manifolds
are found, which admit the time-translation and z-rotation as automorphisms, hence they belong
to representations of the Poincar\'e group. The self-dual 2-form of the massive LCR-structure
is closed implying the existence of the charge conserved quantity. The two conjugate LCR-structures
have g=2 gyromagnetic ratio and opposite charges, suggesting to identify them with the electron
and positron particles. The massless LCR-manifold does not have a charge, suggesting its identification
with the neutrino. The LCR-structure formalism provides these two particles separated into left
and right handed chiral parts. Using their currents and the corresponding fields as correspondence
principles in the Bogoliubov-Medvedev-Polivanov (BMP) S-matrix computational procedure, we
exactly find the standard model lagrangian for the electromagnetic, weak and Higgs interactions.
The relation between the masses and the coupling constants are implied by the requirement to have
a renormalizable lagrangian. The BMP procedure generates counterterms, which make the final lagrangian
to look like a spontaneously broken U(2) gauge theory. But the derived strong interactions are completely
different. The gluon field has a confining propagator, which is completely different to the conventional
Yang-Mills propagator.
