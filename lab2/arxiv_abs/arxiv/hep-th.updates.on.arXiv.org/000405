We study probe corrections to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) in the context of
2D CFTs with large central charge and a sparse spectrum of low dimension operators. In particular,
we focus on observables in the form of non-local composite operators $\mathcal{O}_{obs}(x)=\mathcal{O}_L(x)\mathcal{O}_L(0)$
with $h_L\ll c$. As a light probe, $\mathcal{O}_{obs}(x)$ is constrained by ETH and satisfies $\langle
\mathcal{O}_{obs}(x)\rangle_{h_H}\approx \langle \mathcal{O}_{obs}(x)\rangle_{\text{micro}}$
for a high energy energy eigenstate $| h_H\rangle$. In the CFTs of interests, $\langle \mathcal{O}_{obs}(x)\rangle_{h_H}$
is related to a Heavy-Heavy-Light-Light (HL) correlator, and can be approximated by the vacuum
Virasoro block, which we focus on computing. A sharp consequence of ETH for $\mathcal{O}_{obs}(x)$
is the so called "forbidden singularities", arising from the emergent thermal periodicity in imaginary
time. Using the monodromy method, we show that finite probe corrections of the form $\mathcal{O}(h_L/c)$
drastically alter both sides of the ETH equality %for $x_\tau\geq \beta$%, replacing each thermal
singularity with a pair of branch-cuts. Via the branch-cuts, the vacuum blocks are connected to
infinitely many additional "saddles". We discuss and verify how such violent modification in analytic
structure leads to a natural guess for the blocks at finite $c$: a series of zeros that condense into
branch cuts as $c\to\infty$. We also discuss some interesting evidences connecting these to the
Stoke's phenomena, which are non-perturbative $e^{-c}$ effects. As a related aspect of these probe
modifications, we also compute the Renyi-entropy $S_n$ in high energy eigenstates on a circle.
For subsystems much larger than the thermal length, we obtain a WKB solution to the monodromy problem,
and deduce from this the entanglement spectrum.
