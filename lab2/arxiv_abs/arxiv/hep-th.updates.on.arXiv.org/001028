In the QCD axion dark matter scenario with post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking,
the number density of axions, and hence the dark matter density, depends on the length of string per
unit volume at cosmic time $t$, by convention written $\zeta/t^2$. The expectation has been that
the dimensionless parameter $\zeta$ tends to a constant $\zeta_0$, a feature of a string network
known as scaling. It has recently been claimed that in larger numerical simulations $\zeta$ shows
a logarithmic increase with time, while theoretical modelling suggests an inverse logarithmic
correction. Either case would result in a large enhancement of the string density at the QCD transition,
and a substantial revision to the axion mass required for the axion to constitute all of the dark matter.
With a set of new simulations of global strings we compare the standard scaling (constant-$\zeta$)
model to the logarithmic growth and inverse-logarithmic correction models. In the standard scaling
model, by fitting to linear growth in the mean string separation $\xi = t/\sqrt{\zeta}$, we find
$\zeta_0 = 1.19 \pm 0.20$. We conclude that the apparent corrections to $\zeta$ are artefacts of
the initial conditions, rather than a property of the scaling network. The residuals from the constant-$\zeta$
(linear $\xi$) fit also show no evidence for logarithmic growth, restoring confidence that numerical
simulations can be simply extrapolated from the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to the QCD
scale. Re-analysis of previous work on the axion number density suggests that recent estimates
of the axion dark matter mass in the post-inflationary symmetry-breaking scenario we study should
be increased by about 50%.
