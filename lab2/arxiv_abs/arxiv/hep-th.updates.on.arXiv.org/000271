By using the known operator product expansions (OPEs) between the lowest $16$ higher spin currents
of spins $(1, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 2,2,2,2,2,2, \frac{5}{2},
\frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2}, 3)$ in an extension of the large ${\cal N}=4$ linear superconformal
algebra, one determines the OPEs between the lowest $16$ higher spin currents in an extension of
the large ${\cal N}=4$ nonlinear superconformal algebra for generic $N$ and $k$. The Wolf space
coset contains the group $G =SU(N+2)$ and the affine Kac-Moody spin $1$ current has the level $k$.
The next $16$ higher spin currents of spins $(2,\frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2},
3,3,3,3,3,3, \frac{7}{2}, \frac{7}{2}, \frac{7}{2}, \frac{7}{2},4)$ arise in the above OPEs.
The most general lowest higher spin $2$ current in this multiplet can be determined in terms of affine
Kac-Moody spin $\frac{1}{2}, 1$ currents. By careful analysis of the zero mode (higher spin) eigenvalue
equations, the three-point functions of bosonic higher spin $2, 3, 4$ currents with two scalars
are obtained for finite $N$ and $k$. Furthermore, we also analyze the three-point functions of bosonic
higher spin $2, 3, 4$ currents in the extension of the large ${\cal N}=4$ linear superconformal algebra.
It turns out that the three-point functions of higher spin $2,3$ currents in the two cases are equal
to each other at finite $N$ and $k$. Under the large $(N,k)$ 't Hooft limit, the two descriptions for
the three-point functions of higher spin $4$ current coincide with each other. The higher spin extension
of $SO(4)$ Knizhnik Bershadsky algebra is described.
