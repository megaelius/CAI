We assume that a fundamental open string moves in an eight dimensional space that can be divided into
the four dimensional Minkowski space and a four dimensional Euclidean space. The second space can
be identified with gauge symmetries. There are two $N=1$ local supersymmetries, one applicable
to the world-sheet bosons and fermions corresponding to the first space and the other to those corresponding
to the second space. A new operator ordering in the Virasoro algebra changes the sign of contributions
of the world-sheet fermions to the central charge and cancels the Virasoro anomaly of the full theory.
The ground state in the fermionic sector of open strings is a massless Dirac spinor of the (3+1) dimensional
Minkowski space and the corresponding state in the bosonic sector is a massless vector. So the spectrum
can't be supersymmetric. We develop a model having the local gauge symmetry $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times
U(1)_{Y_W}$ that essentially defines the Standard Model with three generations of fermions. So
the right handed neutrino should decouple as there should be a balance of three left handed spinors.
We show that strong coupling constant vanishes at Planck scale and argue that relative abundances
of leptons and hadronic components of matter can be obtained from the relative strengths of the coupling
constants. We also argue that the ground state scalar tachyons should decouple according to the
spin-statistics theorem and should be point-like objects. A quartic interaction between them
allows the system to choose a negative energy vacuum state (SSB) violating $CP$ and changes the effective
Regge slope. It also has the potential to generate mass of spinors and vectors through world-sheet
action and thus to lead to the break down of $SU(2)_L$ gauge symmetry.
