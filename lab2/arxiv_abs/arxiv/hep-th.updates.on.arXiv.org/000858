In order to understand the confining decoupling solution of the Yang-Mills theory in the Landau
gauge, we consider the massive Yang-Mills model which is defined by just adding a gluon mass term
to the Yang-Mills theory with the Lorentz-covariant gauge fixing term and the associated Faddeev-Popov
ghost term. First of all, we show that massive Yang-Mills model is obtained as a gauge-fixed version
of the gauge-invariantly extended theory which is identified with the gauge-scalar model with
a single fixed-modulus scalar field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This
equivalence is obtained through the gauge-independent description of the Brout-Englert-Higgs
mechanism proposed recently by one of the authors. Then, we reconfirm that the Euclidean gluon and
ghost propagators in the Landau gauge obtained by numerical simulations on the lattice are reproduced
with good accuracy from the massive Yang-Mills model by taking into account one-loop quantum corrections.
Moreover, we demonstrate in a numerical way that the Schwinger function calculated from the gluon
propagator in the Euclidean region exhibits violation of the reflection positivity at the physical
point of the parameters. In addition, we perform the analytic continuation of the gluon propagator
from the Euclidean region to the complex momentum plane towards the Minkowski region. We give an
analytical proof that the reflection positivity is violated for any choice of the parameters in
the massive Yang-Mills model, due to the existence of a pair of complex conjugate poles and the negativity
of the spectral function for the gluon propagator to one-loop order. The complex structure of the
propagator enables us to explain why the gluon propagator in the Euclidean region is well described
by the Gribov-Stingl form.
