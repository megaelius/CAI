We present a new approach to construct the separate variables basis leading to the full characterization
of the transfer matrix spectrum of quantum integrable lattice models. The basis is generated by
the repeated action of the transfer matrix itself on a generically chosen state of the Hilbert space.
The fusion relations for the transfer matrix, stemming from the Yang-Baxter algebra properties,
provide the necessary closure relations to define the action of the transfer matrix on such a basis
in terms of elementary local shifts, leading to a separate transfer matrix spectral problem. Hence
our scheme extends to the quantum case a key feature of Liouville-Arnold classical integrability
framework where the complete set of conserved charges defines both the level manifold and the flows
on it leading to the construction of action-angle variables. We work in the framework of the quantum
inverse scattering method. As a first example of our approach, we give the construction of such a
basis for models associated to Y(gln) and argue how it extends to their trigonometric and elliptic
versions. Then we show how our general scheme applies concretely to fundamental models associated
to the Y(gl2) and Y(gl3) R-matrices leading to the full characterization of their spectrum. For
Y(gl2) and its trigonometric deformation a particular case of our method reproduces Sklyanin's
construction of separate variables. For Y(gl3) it gives new results, in particular through the
proper identification of the shifts acting on the separate basis. We stress that our method also
leads to the full characterization of the spectrum of other known quantum integrable lattice models,
including in particular trigonometric and elliptic spin chains, open chains with general integrable
boundaries, and further higher rank cases that we will describe in forthcoming publications.
