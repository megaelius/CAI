A semiclassical analysis shows that in the process of black hole formation and evaporation, an initial
pure state will evolve to a mixed state, i.e., information will be lost. One way of avoiding this conclusion
without invoking drastic modifications of the local laws of physics in a low curvature regime would
be for the information to be restored at the very end of the evaporation process. It is normally envisioned
that this would require a final burst of particles entangled with the early time Hawking radiation.
This would imply the emission of an extremely large number of particles from an object of Planck size
and mass and would appear to be blatantly ruled out by energy considerations. However, Hotta, Schutzhold,
and Unruh have analyzed a $(1+1)$-dimensional moving mirror analog of the Hawking process and have
found that, in this model, information is restored via entanglement of the early time Hawking radiation
with vacuum fluctuations in the spacetime region to the future of the event where the mirror returns
to inertial motion. We analyze their model here and give a precise formulation of this entanglement
by introducing the notion of ``Milne particles.'' We then analyze the inertial particle and energy
cost of such an entanglement of Hawking radiation with vacuum fluctuations. We show that that, in
fact, the entanglement of early time Hawking radiation with vacuum fluctuations requires the emission
of at least as many late time inertial particles as Hawking particles. Although the energy cost can
be made small in the $(1+1)$-dimensional mirror system, this should not be the case for the $(3+1)$-dimensional
evaporating black hole system. Thus, vacuum entanglement has the same difficulties as the more
usual burst scenarios for attempting to avoid information loss.
