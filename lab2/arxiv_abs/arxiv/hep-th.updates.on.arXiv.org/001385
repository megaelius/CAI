There are many reasons to believe that there is a fundamental minimum length scale below which distances
cannot be reliably resolved. One method of constructing a quantum field with a finite minimum length
scale is to use bandlimited quantum field theory, where the spacetime is mathematically both continuous
and discrete. This is a modification to the field, which has been shown to have many consequences
at the level of the field. We consider an operational approach and use a pair of particle detectors
(two-level qubits) as a local probe of the field, which are coupled to the vacuum of the bandlimited
massless scalar field in a time dependent way through a switching function. We show that mathematically,
the bandlimit modifies the spacial profile of the detectors so that they are only quasi-local. We
explore two different types of switching functions, Gaussian and Dirac delta. We find that with
Gaussian switching, the bandlimit exponentially suppress the de-excitation of the detectors
when the energy gap between the two levels is larger than the bandlimit. If the detectors are prepared
in ground state, in certain regions of the parameter space they are able to extract more entanglement
from the field than if there was no bandlimit. When the detectors couple with Dirac-delta switching,
we show that a particle detector is most sensitive to the bandlimit when it couples to a small but finite
region of spacetime. We find that the effects of a bandlimit are detectable using local probes. This
work is important because it illustrates the possible observable consequences of a fundamental
bandlimit in a quantum field.
