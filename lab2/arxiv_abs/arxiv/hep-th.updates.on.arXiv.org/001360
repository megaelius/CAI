We study the application of the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman (BMHV) scheme of Dimensional
Regularization to the renormalization of chiral gauge theories, focusing on the specific counterterm
structure required by the non-anticommuting Dirac $\gamma_5$ matrix and the breaking of the BRST
invariance. Calculations are performed at the one-loop level in a massless chiral Yang-Mills theory
with chiral fermions and real scalar fields. We discuss the setup and properties of the regularized
theory in detail. Our central results are the full counterterm structures needed for the correct
renormalization: the singular UV-divergent counterterms, including evanescent counterterms
that have to be kept for consistency of higher-loop calculations. We find that the required singular,
evanescent counterterms associated with vector and scalar fields are uniquely determined but
are not gauge invariant. Furthermore, using the framework of algebraic renormalization, we determine
the symmetry-restoring finite counterterms, that are required to restore the BRST invariance,
central to the consistency of the theory. These are the necessary building blocks in one-loop and
higher-order calculations. Finally, renormalization group equations are derived within this
framework, and the derivation is compared with the more customary calculation in the context of
symmetry-invariant regularizations. We explain why, at one-loop level, the extra BMHV-specific
counterterms do not change the results for the RGE. The results we find complete those that have been
obtained previously in the literature in the absence of scalar fields.
