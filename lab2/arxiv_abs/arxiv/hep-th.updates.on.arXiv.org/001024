We perform here a global analysis of the growth index $\gamma$ behaviour from deep in the matter era
till the far future. For a given cosmological model in GR or in modified gravity, the value of $\gamma(\Omega_{m})$
is unique when the decaying mode of scalar perturbations is negligible. However, $\gamma_{\infty}$,
the value of $\gamma$ in the asymptotic future, is unique even in the presence of a nonnegligible
decaying mode today. Moreover $\gamma$ becomes arbitrarily large deep in the matter era. Only in
the limit of a vanishing decaying mode do we get a finite $\gamma$, from the past to the future in this
case. We find further a condition for $\gamma(\Omega_{m})$ to be monotonically decreasing (or
increasing). This condition can be violated inside general relativity (GR) for varying $w_{DE}$
though generically $\gamma(\Omega_{m})$ will be monotonically decreasing (like $\Lambda$CDM),
except in the far future and past. A bump or a dip in $G_{\rm eff}$ can also lead to a significant and
rapid change in the slope $\frac{d\gamma}{d\Omega_{m}}$. On a $\Lambda$CDM background, a $\gamma$
substantially lower (higher) than $0.55$ with a negative (positive) slope reflects the opposite
evolution of $G_{\rm eff}$. In DGP models, $\gamma(\Omega_{m})$ is monotonically increasing
except in the far future. While DGP gravity becomes weaker than GR in the future and $w^{DGP}\to -1$,
we still get $\gamma_{\infty}^{DGP}= \gamma_{\infty}^{\Lambda CDM}=\frac{2}{3}$. In contrast,
despite $G^{DGP}_{\rm eff}\to G$ in the past, $\gamma$ does not tend to its value in GR because $\frac{dG^{DGP}_{\rm
eff}}{d\Omega_{m}}\Big|_{-\infty}\ne 0$.
