Consistent constructive generalization of the introduced recently relativistic covariant wave
packet is deduced on the grounds of general principles of quantum field theory with careful extension
to the higher spins. This state is uniquely defined as a so called interpolating state, which has
the both correct limits to the states localized in momentum space and/or in coordinate space. The
wave packet is unambiguously determined by analytical properties of Wightman function in complex
coordinate space, defining a representation of nonhomogeneous complex Lorentz group. It is shown
how this analytical continuation in coordinate space specifies a universal way to wave-packet
construction for massive particles with arbitrary spin. It appears as only possible careful and
natural relativistic generalization of non relativistic Gaussian wave packet but contains covariant
particle (antiparticle) states only with positive (negative) energy sign and propagates without
their mixing and without changing of its relativistically invariant width. Its specific simultaneous
zero-mass and zero-width limit naturally reduces this packet from 3+1 to 1+1 space-time dimensions,
leading to wave packet on the light cone with a one-parametric freedom. For diagrammatic treatment
of oscillation with the use of these wave packets a covariant meaning of "pole integration" is elucidated
with the help of Huygens' principle in terms of the reduced to mass shell composite wave functions
closely related to overlap functions for the neutrino creation/detection processes. These functions
are explicitly calculated for two-packet case. Theirs various exact, approximating, asymptotic
and limiting expressions are obtained and investigated. The correspondence of their asymptotic
behaviour with the narrow-width approximation of one-packet state and with asymptotic of oscillation
amplitude is established.
