We study the original Sachdev-Ye (SY) model in its Majorana fermion representation which can be
called the two indices Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Its advantage over the original SY model
in the $ SU(M) $ complex fermion representation is that it need no local constraints, so a $1/M $ expansion
can be more easily performed. Its advantage over the 4 indices SYK model is that it has only two site
indices $ J_{ij} $ instead of four indices $ J_{ijkl} $, so it may fit the bulk string theory better.
By performing a $1/M $ expansion at $ N=\infty $, we show that a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state remains
stable at a finite $ M $. The $ 1/M $ corrections are exactly marginal, so the system remains conformably
invariant at any finite $ M $. The 4-point out of time correlation ( OTOC ) shows quantum chaos neither
at $ N=\infty $ at any finite $ M $, nor at $ M=\infty $ at any finite $ N $. By looking at the replica off-diagonal
channel, we find there is a quantum spin glass (QSG) instability at an exponentially suppressed
temperature in $ M $. We work out a criterion for the two large numbers $ N $ and $ M $ to satisfy so that
the QSG instability may be avoided. We speculate that at any finite $ N $, the quantum chaos appears
at the order of $ 1/M^{0} $, which is the subleading order in the $ 1/M $ expansion. When the $ 1/N $ quantum
fluctuations at any finite $ M $ are considered, from a general reparametrization symmetry breaking
point of view, we argue that the eThis work may motivate future works to study the possible new gravity
dual of the 2 indices SYK model.ffective action should still be described by the Schwarzian one,
the OTOC shows maximal quantum chaos.
