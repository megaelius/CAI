We study various transitions in dilaton holography, including those associated with the spontaneous
breaking of a global (superfluid case) or local (superconductor case) U(1) symmetry in diverse
dimensions d. By analyzing the thermodynamics of the dilaton-gravity system we find that scale
invariance is broken at low temperatures, as shown by a nontrivial hyperscaling violation exponent
in the infrared; increasing the temperature we recover scale symmetry in a d dependent way: while
for d=2+1 a phase transition is found, for d=3+1 the transition is rather a crossover. This is the
expected behavior of QCD where the number of colors N_c equals three (although in our holographic
calculations N_c goes to infinity). When the U(1) is preserved and at low temperatures, the system
is insulating for arbitrary d if the dilaton is appropriately coupled to the gauge field; for other
couplings we also find a linear in temperature resistivity. We then determine the prediction of
these models for several quantities in the superconducting phase: the DC and AC conductivity, the
gap for charged excitations, the superfluid density, the vortex profiles, the coherence length,
the penetration depth and the critical magnetic fields. We show that at low temperatures some of
these quantities differ qualitatively compared with the corresponding models without the dilaton,
although the superconductor is robustly of Type II. The ratio of the gap over the critical temperature
of the superconductor is studied in detail varying d and the couplings of the dilaton and then compared
with the BCS value. A holographic renormalization is required in d>2+1 to compute some quantities
(such as the AC conductivity and the penetration depth) and we explain in detail how to perform it.
