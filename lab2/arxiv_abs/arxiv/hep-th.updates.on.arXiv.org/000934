In Cuzinatto et al. [Phys. Rev. D 93, 124034 (2016)], it has been demonstrated that theories of gravity
in which the Lagrangian includes terms depending on the scalar curvature $R$ and its derivatives
up to order $n$, i.e. $f\left(R,\nabla_{\mu}R,\nabla_{\mu_{1}}\nabla_{\mu_{2}}R,\dots,\nabla_{\mu_{1}}\dots\nabla_{\mu_{n}}R\right)$
theories of gravity, are equivalent to scalar-multitensorial theories in the Jordan frame. In
particular, in the metric and Palatini formalisms, this scalar-multitensorial equivalent scenario
shows a structure that resembles that of the Brans-Dicke theories with a kinetic term for the scalar
field with $\omega_{0}=0$ or $\omega_{0}=-3/2$, respectively. In the present work, the aforementioned
analysis is extended to the Einstein frame. The conformal transformation of the metric characterizing
the transformation from Jordan's to Einstein's frame is responsible for decoupling the scalar
field from the scalar curvature and also for introducing a usual kinetic term for the scalar field
in the metric formalism. In the Palatini approach, this kinetic term is absent in the action. Concerning
the other tensorial auxiliary fields, they appear in the theory through a generalized potential.
As an example, the analysis of an extension of the Starobinsky model (with an extra term proportional
to $\nabla_{\mu}R\nabla^{\mu}R$) is performed and the fluid representation for the energy-momentum
tensor is considered. In the metric formalism, the presence of the extra term causes the fluid to
be an imperfect fluid with a heat flux contribution; on the other hand, in the Palatini formalism
the effective energy-momentum tensor for the extended Starobinsky gravity is that of a perfect
fluid type. Finally, it is also shown that the extra term in the Palatini formalism represents a dynamical
field which is able to generate an inflationary regime without a graceful exit.
