In the era of precision cosmology accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is based upon
the implicit assumption of Gaussian nature of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. Therefore,
an important scientific question to ask is whether the observed CMB map is consistent with Gaussian
prediction. In this work we devise a new method where we use Rao's statistic based on sample arc-lengths
to examine the validity of the hypothesis that the temperature field of the CMB is consistent with
a Gaussian random field, by comprehensively testing correlations within a given $\ell$ mode and
between nearby $\ell$ modes phases. This circular statistic is ordered and non-parametric. We
performed our analysis on the scales limited by spherical harmonic modes $\le$ 128, to restrict
ourselves to signal dominated region. To find the correlated sets of phases, we calculate the statistic
for the data and 10000 Monte Carlo simulated random sets of phases and used 0.01 and 0.05 $\alpha$
levels to distinguish between statistically significant and highly significant detections.
We apply our method on Planck satellite mission's final released CMB temperature anisotropy maps-
COMMANDER, SMICA, NILC, and SEVEM along with WMAP 9 year released ILC map. We report that phases corresponding
to some of the modes are non-uniform in these maps. We also report that most of the mode pairs are uncorrelated
in each map, but a few are found to be correlated, which are different pairs in different maps. The
detection of non-uniformity and correlations in the phases indicates presence of non Gaussian
signals in the foreground minimized CMB maps.
