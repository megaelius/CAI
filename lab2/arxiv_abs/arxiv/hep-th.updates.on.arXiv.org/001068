We offer a geometric interpretation of attractor theories with singular kinetic terms as a union
of multiple canonical models. We demonstrate that different domains (separated by poles) can drastically
differ in their phenomenology. We illustrate this with the help of a "master model" that leads to
distinct predictions depending on which side of the pole the field evolves before examining the
more realistic example of $\alpha$-attractor models. Such models lead to quintessential inflation
within the poles when featuring an exponential potential. However, beyond the poles, we discover
a novel behaviour: the scalar field responsible for the early-time acceleration of the Universe
may reach the boundary of the field-space manifold, indicating that the theory is incomplete and
that a boundary condition must be imposed in order to determine its late-time behaviour. If the evolution
of the field is arrested before this happens, however, we discover that quintessence can be achieved
without a potential offset. Turning to multifield models with singular kinetic terms, we see that
poles generalise straightforwardly to singular curves, which act as "model walls" between distinct
pole-free inflationary models. As an example, we study a simple two-field $\alpha$-attractor-inspired
model, whose evolution of isocurvature perturbations is sensitive to where the non-canonical
field begins its trajectory. We finally discuss initial conditions in attractor theories, where
the existence of multiple disconnected canonical models implies that we must make a fundamental
choice: in which domain we impose a distribution for the inflaton in order to then determine the likelihood
of inflation.
