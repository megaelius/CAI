It is known that one can define a consistent theory of extended, $N=2$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) Supergravity
(SUGRA) in $D=4$. Besides the standard gravitational part, this theory involves a single $U(1)$
gauge field and a pair of Majorana vector-spinors that can be mixed into a pair of charged spin-$3/2$
gravitini. The action for $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA is invariant under $SO(1,3)\times U(1)$ gauge
transformations, and under local SUSY. We present a geometric action that involves two "inhomogeneous"
parts: an orthosymplectic $OSp(4\vert 2)$ gauge-invariant action of the Yang-Mills type, and
a supplementary action invariant under purely bosonic $SO(2,3)\times U(1)\sim Sp(4)\times SO(2)$
sector of $OSp(4\vert 2)$, that needs to be added for consistency. This action reduces to $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$
SUGRA after gauge fixing, for which we use a constrained auxiliary field in the manner of Stelle and
West. Canonical deformation is performed by using the Seiberg-Witten approach to noncommutative
(NC) gauge field theory with the Moyal product. The NC-deformed action is expanded in powers of the
deformation parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ up to the first order. We show that $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA
has non-vanishing linear NC correction in the physical gauge, originating from the additional,
purely bosonic action. For comparison, simple $N=1$ Poinacar\'{e} SUGRA can be obtained in the
same manner, directly from an $OSp(4\vert 1)$ gauge-invariant action. The first non-vanishing
NC correction is quadratic in $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and therefore exceedingly difficult to calculate.
Under Wigner-In\"{o}n\"{u} (WI) contraction, $N=2$ AdS superalgebra reduces to $N=2$ Poincar\'{e}
superalgebra, and it is not clear whether this relation holds after canonical deformation. We present
the linear NC correction to $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA explicitly, discuss its low-energy limit, and
what remains of it after WI contraction.
