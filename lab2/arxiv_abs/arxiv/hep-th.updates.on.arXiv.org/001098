Negative mass makes perfect physical sense as long as the dominant energy condition is satisfied
by the corresponding energy-momentum tensor. Heretofore, only {\it configurations} of negative
mass had been found \cite{Belletete:2013nqa,Mbarek:2014ppa}, the analysis did not address stability
or dynamics. In this paper, we analyze both of these criteria. We demonstrate the existence of {\it
stable}, static, negative mass bubbles in an asymptotically de Sitter space-time. The bubbles
are solutions of the Einstein equations and correspond to an interior region of space-time containing
a specific mass distribution, separated by a thin wall from the exact, negative mass Schwarzschild-de
Sitter space-time in the exterior. We apply the Israel junction conditions at the wall. For the case
of an interior corresponding simply to de Sitter space-time with a different cosmological constant
from the outside space-time, separated by a thin wall with energy density that is independent of
the radius, we find static but unstable solutions which satisfy the dominant energy condition everywhere.
The bubbles can collapse through spherically symmetric configurations to the exact, singular,
negative mass Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution. Interestingly, this provides a counter-example
of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. Alternatively, the junction conditions can be used to give
rise to an interior mass distribution that depends on the potential for the radius of the wall. We
show that for no choice of the potential, for positive energy density on the wall that is independent
of the radius, can we get a solution that is non-singular at the origin. However, if we allow the energy
density on the wall to depend on the radius of the bubble, we can find {\it stable}, static, non-singular
solutions of negative mass which everywhere satisfy the dominant energy condition.
