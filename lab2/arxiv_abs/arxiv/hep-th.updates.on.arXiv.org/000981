An introductory overview of current research developments regarding solitons and fractional
boundary charges in graphene nanoribbons is presented. Graphene nanoribbons and polyacetylene
have chiral symmetry and share numerous similar properties, e.g., the bulk-edge correspondence
between the Zak phase and the existence of edge states, along with the presence of chiral boundary
states, which are important for charge fractionalization. In polyacetylene, a fermion mass potential
in the Dirac equation produces an excitation gap, and a twist in this scalar potential produces a
zero-energy chiral soliton. Similarly, in a gapful armchair graphene nanoribbon, a distortion
in the chiral gauge field can produce soliton states. In polyacetylene, a soliton is bound to a domain
wall connecting two different dimerized phases. In graphene nanoribbons, a domain-wall soliton
connects two topological zigzag edges with different chiralities. However, such a soliton does
not display spin-charge separation. The existence of a soliton in finite-length polyacetylene
can induce formation of fractional charges on the opposite ends. In contrast, for gapful graphene
nanoribbons, the antiferromagnetic coupling between the opposite zigzag edges induces integer
boundary charges. The presence of disorder in graphene nanoribbons partly mitigates antiferromagnetic
coupling effect. Hence, the average edge charge of gap states with energies within a small interval
is e/2, with significant charge fluctuations. However, midgap states exhibit a well-defined charge
fractionalization between the opposite zigzag edges in the weak-disorder regime. Numerous occupied
soliton states in a disorder-free and doped zigzag graphene nanoribbon form a solitonic phase.
