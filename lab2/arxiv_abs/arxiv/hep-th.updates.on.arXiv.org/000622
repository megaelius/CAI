The standard model of particle physics is extraordinarily successful at explaining much of the
physical realm. Yet, one of that model's most profound aspects, the mechanism of confinement binding
quarks into hadrons, is insufficiently understood. Though the idea that confinement is mediated
by (chromo)-electric strings in a condensate of magnetic monopoles is generally accepted, it still
lacks experimental evidence. Here we demonstrate that the infinite resistance superinsulating
state, which emerges at the insulating side of the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT)
in superconducting films, is a desktop realization of confinement that allows for direct experimental
access. Showing that superinsulators realize a single-color version of quantum chromodynamics
(QCD), we establish the mapping of quarks onto Cooper pairs and reveal that the mechanism behind
the infinite resistance of superinsulators is the binding of Cooper pairs into neutral "mesons"
by means of electric strings. We show that the linear confinement binds Cooper pairs in both two-
and three dimensions, thus generalizing the concept of superinsulation onto 3D systems. Furthermore,
we calculate the deconfinement temperature, which in 2D coincides with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) transition temperature. We reveal a Cooper pair analogue of the asymptotic freedom effect,
which suggests that systems smaller than the string scale appear in a quantum metallic state. Our
findings offer a powerful laboratory for exploring fundamental implications of confinement,
asymptotic freedom, and related quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena via desktop experiments
on superconductors.
