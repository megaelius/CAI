Under the assumption that the current epoch of the Universe is not special, i.e. is not the final state
of a long history of processes in particle physics, the cosmological fate of $SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{\rm
EM}$ is investigated. Spontaneous symmetry breaking of $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ at the temperature of the
Universe today is carried out. The charged scalar field $\phi_{\rm EM}$ which breaks the symmetry
is found to be ruled out for the charge of the electron, $q=e$. Scalar fields with millicharges are
viable and limits on their masses and charges are found to be $q\lesssim10^{-3}e$ and $m_{\phi_{\rm
EM}}\lesssim10^{-5} \rm eV$. Furthermore, it is possible that $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ has already been
broken at temperatures higher than $T=2.7K$ given the nonzero limits on the mass of the photon. A
photon mass of $m_{\gamma}=10^{-18} \rm eV$, the current upper limit, is found to require a spontaneously
symmetry breaking scalar mass of $m_{\phi_{\rm EM}}\sim 10^{-13} \rm eV$ with charge $q=10^{-6}e$,
well within the allowed parameter space of the model. Finally, the cosmological fate of the strong
interaction is studied. $SU(3)_C$ is tested for complementarity in which the confinement phase
of QCD $+$ colored scalars is equivalent to a spontaneously broken $SU(3)$ gauge theory. If complementarity
is not applicable, $SU(3)_C$ has multiple symmetry breaking paths with various final symmetry
structures. The stability of the colored vacuum at finite temperature in this scenario is nonperturbative
and a definitive statement on the fate of $SU(3)_C$ is left open. Cosmological implications for
the metastability of the vacua - electromagnetic, color and electroweak - are discussed.
