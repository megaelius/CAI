We recently introduced in [1910.03008] a "boundary-to-bound" dictionary between gravitational
scattering data and observables for bound states of non-spinning bodies. In this paper, we elaborate
further on this (holographic) map. We start by deriving the following -- remarkably simple -- formula
relating the periastron advance to the scattering angle: $\Delta \Phi(J,{\cal E}) =\chi(J,{\cal
E}) + \chi (-J,{\cal E})$, via analytic continuation in angular momentum and binding energy. Using
explicit expressions from [1910.03008], we confirm its validity to all orders in the Post-Minkowskian
(PM) expansion. Furthermore, we reconstruct the radial action for the bound state directly from
the knowledge of the scattering angle. The radial action enables us to write compact expressions
for dynamical invariants in terms of the deflection angle to all PM orders, which can also be written
as a function of the PM-expanded amplitude. As an example, we reproduce our result in [1910.03008]
for the periastron advance, and compute the radial and azimuthal frequencies and redshift variable
to two-loops. Agreement is found in the overlap between PM and Post-Newtonian (PN) schemes. Last
but not least, we initiate the study of our dictionary including spin. We demonstrate that the same
relation between deflection angle and periastron advance applies for aligned-spin contributions,
with $J$ the (canonical) total angular momentum. Explicit checks are performed to display perfect
agreement using state-of-the-art PN results in the literature. Using the map between test- and
two-body dynamics, we also compute the periastron advance up to quadratic order in the spin, to one-loop
and to all orders in velocity. We conclude with a discussion on the generalized "impetus formula"
for spinning bodies and black holes as "elementary particles".
