Some of the most important probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy ion collisions
come from the analysis of how the shape and energy of jets are modified by passage through QGP. We model
an ensemble of back-to-back dijets to gain a qualitative understanding of how the shapes of the individual
jets and the asymmetry in the energy of the pairs of jets are modified by passage through an expanding
droplet of strongly coupled plasma, as modeled in a holographic gauge theory. We do so by constructing
an ensemble of strings in the gravitational description of the gauge theory. We model QCD jets in
vacuum using strings whose endpoints move "downward" into the gravitational bulk spacetime with
some fixed small angle that represents the opening angle (ratio of jet mass to jet energy) that the
QCD jet would have in vacuum. Such strings must be moving through the gravitational bulk at (close
to) the speed of light; they must be (close to) null. This condition does not specify the energy distribution
along the string, meaning that it does not specify the shape of the jet being modeled. We study the
dynamics of strings that are initially not null and show that strings with a wide range of initial
conditions rapidly accelerate and become null and, as they do, develop a similar distribution of
their energy density. We use this distribution of the energy density along the string, choose an
ensemble of strings whose opening angles and energies are distributed as in perturbative QCD, and
show that we can then fix one model parameter such that the mean jet shape in our ensemble matches that
measured in p-p collisions reasonably well. We send our strings through the plasma, choosing the
second model parameter to get a reasonable suppression in the number of jets, and study how the mean
jet shape and the dijet asymmetry are modified, comparing both to data from LHC heavy ion collisions.
