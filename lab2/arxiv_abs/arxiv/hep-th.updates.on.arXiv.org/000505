New exact solution class of Born -- Infeld type nonlinear scalar field model is obtained. The variational
principle of this model has a specific form which is characteristic for extremal four-dimensional
hypersurface or hyper-film in five-dimensional space-time. Obtained solutions are singular
solitons propagating with speed of light and having energy, momentum, and angular momentum which
can be calculated for explicit conditions. Such solitons will be called the lightlike ones. The
soliton singularity has a form of moving two-dimensional surface or shell. The lightlike soliton
can have a set of tubelike singular shells with the appropriate cavities. A twisted lightlike soliton
is considered. It is notable that its energy is proportional to its angular momentum in high-frequency
approximation. A case with one tubelike cavity is considered. In this case the soliton shell is diffeomorphic
to a cylindrical surface with threads by multifilar helix. The shell transverse size of the appropriate
finite energy soliton can be converging to zero at infinity. The ideal gas of such lightlike solitons
with minimal twist parameter is considered in a finite volume. Explicit conditions provide that
the angular momentum of each soliton in the volume equals Planck constant. The equilibrium energy
spectral density for the solitons is obtained. It has the form of Planck distribution in some approximation.
A beam of the twisted lightlike solitons is considered. The representation of arbitrary polarization
for the beam with the twisted lightlike solitons is discussed. It is shown that the effect of mechanical
angular momentum transfer to absorbent by the circularly polarized beam can be provided. This effect
is well known for photon beam. Thus the soliton solution which have determinate likeness with photon
is obtained in particular.
