In this paper quantum effects are investigated in a very special two-scalar field model having a
moduli space of BPS topological defects. In a $(1+1)$-dimensional space-time the defects are classically
degenerate in mass kinks, but in $(3+1)$ dimensions the kinks become BPS domain walls, all of them
sharing the same surface tension at the classical level. The heat kernel/zeta function regularization
method will be used to control the divergences induced by the quantum kink and domain wall fluctuations.
A generalization of the Gilkey-DeWitt-Avramidi heat kernel expansion will be developed in order
to accommodate the infrared divergences due to zero modes in the spectra of the second-order kink
and domain wall fluctuation operators, which are respectively $N\times N$ matrix ordinary or partial
differential operators. Use of these tools in the spectral zeta function associated with the Hessian
operators paves the way to obtain general formulas for the one-loop kink mass and domain wall tension
shifts in any $(1+1)$- or $(3+1)$-dimensional $N$-component scalar field theory model. Application
of these formulae to the BPS kinks or domain walls of the $N=2$ model mentioned above reveals the breaking
of the classical mass or surface tension degeneracy at the quantum level. Because the main parameter
distinguishing each member in the BPS kink or domain wall moduli space is essentially the distance
between the centers of two basic kinks or walls, the breaking of the degeneracy amounts to the surge
in quantum-induced forces between the two constituent topological defects. The differences in
surface tension induced by one-loop fluctuations of BPS walls give rise mainly to attractive forces
between the constituent walls except if the two basic walls are very far apart. Repulsive forces
between two close walls only arise if the coupling is approaches the critical value from below.
