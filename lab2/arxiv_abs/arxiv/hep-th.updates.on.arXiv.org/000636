We present the rigorous derivation of spin operators whose square is the second Casimir invariant
of the Poincar\'e group. It is shown that only two spin operators, of all that are general linear combinations
of the components of Pauli-Lubanski vector with momentum-dependent coefficients, satisfy the
spin algebra and transform properly under the Lorentz transformation. They provide the two inequivalent
representations, i.e., the left-handed and the right-handed representation of the Poincar\'e
group, in which the base states describe free massive chiral fields with integer or half-integer
spin $s$. In case that the Poincar\'e group is extended by parity operation, a massive elementary
spin $s$ field should be represented by the direct sum of the left-handed and the right-handed representation.
The two spin operators providing the left-handed and the right-handed representation are not axial
and not Hermitian as themselves. This implies that the two spin operators are not observables as
themselves. The spin operator in the direct sum representation is axial and also becomes Hermitian
acting on either a positive or a negative energy representation space. Therefore, the physical
theory with a spin as an observable is provided from the parity-extended Poinar\'e group, not just
the Poincar\'e group. For spin $1/2$, the parity operation expressed by the Lorentz boost in the
direct sum representation naturally leads to the fundamental dynamical equation that is shown
to be equal to the covariant equation for free Dirac field, which was originally derived from the
homogeneous Lorentz symmetry. However, the equality of the two dynamical equations does not mean
that the two theories are equivalent in physical aspect because, for instance, the spin operators
in the two theories are different, and the spin in the new theory is conserved by itself but is not in
the usual Dirac theory.
