Recently a one-parameter extension of the covariant Heisenberg algebra with the extension parameter
$l$ ($l$ is a non-negative constant parameter which has a dimension of $[momentum]^{-1}$) in a $(D+1)$-dimensional
Minkowski space-time has been presented [G. P. de Brito, P. I. C. Caneda, Y. M. P. Gomes, J. T. Guaitolini
Junior and V. Nikoofard, Effective models of quantum gravity induced by Planck scale modifications
in the covariant quantum algebra, Adv. High Energy Phys. 2017 (2017) 4768341]. The Abelian Proca
model is reformulated from the viewpoint of the above one-parameter extension of the covariant
Heisenberg algebra. It is shown that the free space solutions of the above modified Proca model satisfy
the modified dispersion relation $\frac{\textbf{p}^2}{\left(1+\frac{\Lambda^2}{2\hbar^2}\textbf{p}^2\right)^2}=m^2c^2$
where $\Lambda=\hbar l$ is the characteristic length scale in our model. This modified dispersion
relation describes two massive vector particles with the effective masses ${\cal M}_{_\pm}(\Lambda)=\frac{2m}{1\mp\sqrt{1-2\left(\frac{mc\Lambda}{\hbar}\right)^2}}$.
Numerical estimations show that the maximum value of $\Lambda$ in a four-dimensional space-time
is near to the electroweak length scale, i.e., $\Lambda_{_{max}}\sim l_{_{electroweak}}\sim10^{-18}\;
m$. We show that in the infrared/large-distance domain the modified Proca model behaves like an
Abelian massive Lee-Wick model which has been presented by Accioly and his co-workers [A. Accioly,
J. Helayel-Neto, G. Correia, G. Brito, J. de Almeida and W. Herdy, Interparticle potential energy
for D-dimensional electromagnetic models from the corresponding scalar ones, Phys. Rev. D 93 (2016)
