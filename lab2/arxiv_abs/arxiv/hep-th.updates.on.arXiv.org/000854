The composition as well as the very existence of the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) remains
at the forefront of open problems in fundamental physics. To address this issue, we turn to Hawking's
"principle of ignorance", which says that, for an observer with limited information, all descriptions
that are consistent with known physics are equally valid. We compare three different observers
who view the BH from the outside and agree on the external Schwarzschild geometry. First, the modernist,
who accepts the classical BH as the final state of gravitational collapse, the singularity theorems
that underlie this premise and the central singularity that the theorems predict. The modernist
is willing to describe matter in terms of quantum fields in curved space but insists on (semi)classical
gravity. Second is the skeptic, who wishes to evade any singular behavior by finding a loophole to
the singularity theorems within the realm of classical general relativity (GR). The third is a postmodernist
who similarly wants to circumvent the singularity theorems but is willing to invoke exotic quantum
physics in the gravitational and/or matter sector to do so. The postmodern view suggests that the
uncertainty principle can stabilize a classically singular BH in a similar manner to the stabilization
of the classically unstable hydrogen atom: Strong quantum effects in the matter and gravitational
sectors resolve the would-be singularity over horizon-sized length scales. The postmodern picture
then requires a significant departure from (semi)classical gravity, as well as some exotic matter
beyond the standard model of particle physics (SM). We find that only the postmodern framework is
consistent with what is known so far about BH physics and conclude that a valid description of the
BH interior needs matter beyond the SM and gravitational physics beyond (semi)classical GR.
