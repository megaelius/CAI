We study the entanglement dynamics for two uniformly accelerated two-level atoms in interaction
with a bath of fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum in the presence of a reflecting boundary.
We consider two different alignments of atoms, i.e. parallel and vertical alignments with respect
to the boundary. In particular, we focus on the effects of the boundary, and acceleration on the entanglement
dynamics, which are closely related to the orientations of polarization. For the parallel case,
the initial entanglement of two transversely polarizable atoms very close to the boundary can be
preserved as if it were a closed system, while for two vertically polarizable atoms, the concurrence
evolves two times as fast as that in the free space. In the presence of a boundary, entanglement revival
is possible for two atoms initially in the symmetric state depending on the orientations of the atomic
polarizations, which is in sharp contrast to the fact that the concurrence always decays monotonically
in the free space. Interestingly, two initially separable atoms, for which entanglement generation
can never happen in the free space with any given acceleration and separation, can get entangled
in the presence of a boundary if they are aligned parallel to the boundary. The birth time of entanglement
can be noticeably advanced or postponed for the parallel two-atom system placed close to the boundary,
while the maximal concurrence during evolution can be significantly enhanced when the atoms are
vertically aligned. Moreover, two inertial atoms with different polarizations remain separable
all the time, while as the acceleration increases, the delayed birth of entanglement happens, and
the nonzero concurrence can be enhanced.
