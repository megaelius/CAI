We analyze $2+1d$ and $3+1d$ Bosonic Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) phases of matter protected
by onsite symmetry group $G$ by using dual bulk and boundary approaches. In the bulk we study an effective
field theory which upon coupling to a background flat $G$ gauge field furnishes a purely topological
response theory. The response action evaluated on certain manifolds, with appropriate choice
of background gauge field, defines a set of SPT topological invariants. Further, SPTs can be gauged
by summing over all isomorphism classes of flat $G$ gauge fields to obtain Dijkgraaf-Witten topological
$G$ gauge theories. These topological gauge theories can be ungauged by first introducing and then
proliferating defects that spoils the gauge symmetry. This mechanism is related to anyon condensation
in $2+1d$ and condensing bosonic gauge charges in $3+1d$. In the dual boundary approach, we study
$1+1d$ and $2+1d$ quantum field theories that have $G$ 't-Hooft anomalies that can be precisely
cancelled by (the response theory of) the corresponding bulk SPT. We show how to construct/compute
topological invariants for the bulk SPTs directly from the boundary theories. Further we sum over
boundary partition functions with different background gauge fields to construct $G$-characters
that generate topological data for the bulk topological gauge theory. Finally, we study a $2+1d$
quantum field theory with a mixed $\mathbb{Z}_2^{T/R} \times U(1)$ anomaly where $\mathbb{Z}_2^{T/R}$
is time-reversal/reflection symmetry, and the $U(1)$ could be a 0-form or 1-form symmetry depending
on the choice of time reversal/reflection action. We briefly discuss the bulk effective action
and topological response for a theory in $3+1d$ that cancels this anomaly. This signals the existence
of SPTs in $3+1d$ protected by 0,1-form $U(1)\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T,R}$.
