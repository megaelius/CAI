Recently, "fracton topological order" has been intensively studied as an exotic class of topological
phases of matter. The most salient feature is that topological excitations can only be moved within
certain subspace on the three-dimensional (3D) lattice. In the present paper, we construct exactly
solvable lattice models in all spatial dimensions higher than 3D. Such models, which are uniquely
denoted by four integers, can be regarded as stabilizer codes defined on a hypercubic network. The
well-known X-cube model in 3D is labeled by $[0,1,2,3]$ as a special case of the model family. We also
introduce a useful notation---a pair of integers $(n,m)$---to label \textit{simple excitations},
which are simple geometric objects, e.g., point-like, closed string-like, etc.. Here, $n=0$ for
particles, $n=1$ for strings, $\cdots$; $m$ denotes the dimension of the submanifold where excitations
can move. Therefore, fractons are labeled by $(0,0)$. In addition to simple excitations, as a salient
feature of higher-dimensional fracton topological order, we also find a class of excitations---\textit{complex
excitations}---that are geometrically complicated and cannot be simply regarded as bound states
of simple excitations. For example, the energy gap of complex excitations is usually not a naive
sum of point, string, membrane etc. We compute several concrete examples, especially $[1,2,3,4]$,
$[0,1,2,4]$ and $[1,2,3,5]$. Especially, the model $[1,2,3,4]$ supports exotic complex excitations
that we dub "chairons" due to its chair shape, which exhibits nontrivial fusion rules. We also construct
a family tree in which mother model and child model share similar gene of excitation spectrum. Several
implications including condensed matter physics and gravity are discussed in brief.
