This article presents a new model-independent constraint for bouncing black hole geometries within
the thin shell formalism. This constraint sets a bound on the minimal allowed radius of the time-like
surface of the collapsing star at the bounce. It follows from this bound that the shell always bounces
in an untrapped region or precisely on a trapping horizon. This constraint is of purely kinematical
origin as it descends from the continuity of the metric between the geometries describing the interior
and exterior of the collapsing object so that it is completely model-independent. The second part
of this work investigates the conditions under which an effective extension of the Oppenheimer-Snyder
collapse can describe consistent bouncing black hole solutions. We show that on top of the previous
kinematical constraint, an additional dynamical condition has to be satisfied in order for the
model to admit well-defined black-to-white hole solutions. As expected, this second condition
turns out to be model-dependent. The resulting class of models describing bouncing compact objects
are characterized by three parameters for the star (mass, initial radius and density) and two quantum
parameters descending from the UV-completion of the exterior and interior geometries. The solution
space contains (1) bouncing stars and (2) bouncing black holes and (3) a new class of astrophysical
objects which alternate between a bouncing star and a bouncing black hole. Finally, we provide an
explicit construction of a black-to-white hole bounce using the techniques of spatially closed
LQC and discuss the novel properties induced by the presence of the inner horizon in this new framework.
This generic framework lays down the foundation for interesting phenomenological investigations
concerning the astrophysical properties of these objects, as well as a novel platform for further
developments.
