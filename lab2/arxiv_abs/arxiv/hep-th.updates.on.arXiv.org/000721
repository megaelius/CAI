We study the relations between solitons of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation described systems
and eigen-states of linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with some quantum wells. Many different non-degenerated
solitons are re-derived from the eigen-states in the quantum wells. We show that the vector solitons
for coupled system with attractive interactions correspond to the identical eigen-states with
the ones of coupled systems with repulsive interactions. The energy eigenvalues of them seem to
be different, but they can be reduced to identical ones in the same quantum wells. The non-degenerated
solitons for multi-component systems can be used to construct much abundant degenerated solitons
in more components coupled cases. On the other hand, we demonstrate soliton solutions in nonlinear
systems can be also used to solve the eigen-problems of quantum wells. As an example, we present eigenvalue
and eigen-state in a complicated quantum well for which the Hamiltonian belongs to the non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian having Parity-Time symmetry. We further present the ground state and the first exited
state in an asymmetric quantum double-well from asymmetric solitons. Based on these results, we
expect that many nonlinear physical systems can be used to observe the quantum states evolution
of quantum wells, such as water wave tank, nonlinear fiber, Bose-Einstein condensate, and even
plasma, although some of them are classical physical systems. These relations provide another
different way to understand the stability of solitons in nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation described
systems, in contrast to the balance between dispersion and nonlinearity.
