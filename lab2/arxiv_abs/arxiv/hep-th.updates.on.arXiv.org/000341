I clarify, restate and show more clearly some key points I raised in a number of papers that discussed
the non-linear gauge-fixing condition and quark confinement. I also correct some errors, which
do not detract from the key findings, found in the original papers. However, there are two major corrections
I will make in this paper, the first is on the proof of the Parisi-Sourlas mechanism and the second
is on the effective action for the 'gluons', which leads to a direct proof of gluons being confined
inside hadrons. The correction also leads to how the mass gap will be calculated, which was explicitly
done in 2D. The starting point is that contrary to the prevailing ideas in the literature, the Coulomb
gauge is an incomplete gauge-fixing condition in the sense that there are field configurations
that cannot be gauge transformed to the Coulomb gauge. In other words the orbit of these configurations
will not intersect the Coulomb gauge surface. I proposed the non-linear gauge condition precisely
because it includes the Coulomb gauge in the high energy (short distance) regime and the quadratic
regime (the large distance regime where the running coupling becomes large), where the gauge fields
cannot be gauge transformed to the Coulomb surface. We proposed a new decomposition of the gauge
potential in the non-linear regime, which involves an isoscalar (the divergence of the gauge field)
and a new vector field, which exhibits a mass gap and confinement. When we add the quarks, we find that
they are localized to a given distance scale and has an effective four-Fermi action with a linear
potential. Thus, we have shown a mass gap for gluons and confinement for both dynamical quarks and
gluons.
