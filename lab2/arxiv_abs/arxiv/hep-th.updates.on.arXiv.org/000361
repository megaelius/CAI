We investigate whether a spontaneously-broken gauge theory of the group $SU(2,2)$ may be a genuine
competitor to General Relativity. The basic ingredients of the theory are an $SU(2,2)$ gauge field
$A_{\mu}$ and a Higgs field $W$ in the adjoint representation of the group with the Higgs field producing
the symmetry breaking $SU(2,2)\rightarrow SO(1,3)\times SO(1,1)$. The action for gravity is
polynomial in $\{A_{\mu},W\}$ and the field equations are first-order in derivatives of these
fields. The new $SO(1,1)$ symmetry in the gravitational sector is interpreted in terms of an emergent
scale symmetry and the recovery of conformalized General Relativity and fourth-order Weyl conformal
gravity as limits of the theory- following imposition of Lagrangian constraints- is demonstrated.
Maximally symmetric spacetime solutions to the full theory are found and stability of the theory
around these solutions is investigated; it is shown that regions of the theory's parameter space
describe perturbations identical to that of General Relativity coupled to a massive scalar field
and a massless one-form field. The coupling of gravity to matter is considered and it is shown that
actions for all fields are naturally gauge-invariant, polynomial in fields and yield first-order
field equations; no auxiliary fields are introduced. Familiar Yang-Mills and Klein-Gordon type
Lagrangians are recovered on-shell in the General-Relativistic limit of the theory. In this formalism,
the General-Relativistic limit and the breaking of scale invariance appear as two sides of the same
coin and it is shown that the latter generates mass terms for Higgs and spinor fields.
