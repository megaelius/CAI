We compute the lowest operator dimension $\Delta(J;D)$ at large global charge $J$ in the $O(2)$
Wilson-Fisher model in $D=4-\epsilon$ dimensions, to leading order in both $1/J$ and $\epsilon$.
The final result for $\Delta(J;D)$ in the (resummed) $\epsilon$-expansion, valid when $J\gg 1/\epsilon
\gg 1$, turns out to be \begin{equation*} \Delta(J;D)=\left[\frac{2(D-1)}{3(D-2)}\left(\frac{9(D-2)\pi}{5D}\right)^{\frac{D}{2(D-1)}}\left[\frac{5\Gamma\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)}{24\pi^2}\right]^{\frac{1}{D-1}}
\epsilon^{\frac{D-2}{2(D-1)}}\right]\times J^{\frac{D}{D-1}}+O\left(J^{\frac{D-2}{D-1}}\right)
\end{equation*} where next-to-leading order onwards were not computed here due to technical cumbersomeness,
despite there are no fundamental difficulties. We also compare the result at $\epsilon=1$, \begin{equation*}
\Delta(J)=0.293\times J^{3/2}+\cdots \end{equation*} to the actual data from the Monte-Carlo
simulation in three dimensions \cite{Banerjee:2017fcx}, and the discrepancy of the coefficient
$0.293$ from the numerics turned out to be $13\%$. Additionally, we also find a crossover of $\Delta(J;D)$
from $\Delta(J)\propto J^{\frac{D}{D-1}}$ to $\Delta(J)\propto J$, at around $J\sim 1/\epsilon$,
as one decreases $J$ while fixing $\epsilon$ (or vice versa), reflecting the fact that there are
no interacting fixed-point at $\epsilon=0$. Based on this behaviour, we propose an interesting
double-scaling limit which fixes $\lambda\equiv J\epsilon$, suitable for probing the region
of the crossover. I will give $\Delta(J;D)$ to next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, either
in $1/\lambda$ or in $\lambda$, valid when $\lambda\gg 1$ and $\lambda\ll 1$, respectively.
