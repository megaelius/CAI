We describe a new type of generalized gravity-matter models where $f(R)=R+R^2$ gravity couples
in a non-conventional way to a scalar "inflaton" field, to a second scalar "darkon" field responsible
for dark energy/dark matter unification, as well as to a non-standard nonlinear gauge field system,
which is responsible for a charge confining/deconfinfing mechanism. The essential non-conventional
feature of our models is employing the formalism of non-Riemannian volume forms, i.e. metric-independent
non-Riemannian volume elements on the spacetime manifold, defined in terms of auxiliary antisymmetric
tensor gauge fields. Although being (almost) pure-gauge degrees of freedom, the non-Riemannian
volume-forms trigger a series of important features unavailable in ordinary gravity-matter models.
Upon passing to the physical Einstein frame we obtain an effective matter-gauge-field Lagrangian
of quadratic "k-essence" type both w.r.t. the "inflaton" and the "darkon", with the following properties:
(i) Remarkable effective "inflaton" potential possessing two infinitely large flat regions with
vastly different heights ("vacuum" energy densities) describing the "early" and "late" Universe;
(ii) Nontrivial effective gauge coupling constants running with the "inflaton", in particular,
effective "inflaton"-running coupling constant, which determines the strength of the charge
confienement; (iii) The confinement-strength gauge coupling constant is non-zero in the "late"
Universe, i.e., charge confinement is operating, whereas it vanishes in the "early" Universe,
i.e., confinement-free epoch; (iv) The unification of dark energy and dark matter is explicitly
seen within the FLRW reduction, where they appear as dynamically generated effective vacuum energy
density and dynamically induced dust-like matter, correspondingly.
