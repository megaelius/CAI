The scheme and gauge dependence of the factorization property of the RG $\beta$-function in the
$SU(N_c)$ QCD generalized Crewther relation (GCR), which connects the non-singlet contributions
to the Adler and Bjorken polarized sum rule functions, is investigated at the $\mathcal{O}(a^4_s)$
level. In the gauge-invariant $\rm{\overline{MS}}$-scheme this property holds at least at this
order. To study whether this property is true in all gauge-invariant schemes, we consider the $\rm{MS}$-like
schemes in QCD and the QED-limit of the GCR in the $\rm{\overline{MS}}$-scheme and in the $\rm{MOM}$
and the $\rm{OS}$ schemes. In these schemes we confirm the existence of the $\beta$-function factorization
in the QCD and QED variants of the GCR. The problem of the possible $\beta$-factorization in the gauge-dependent
renormalization schemes in QCD is studied. We consider the gauge non-invariant $\rm{mMOM}$ and
$\rm{MOMgggg}$-schemes and demonstrate that in the $\rm{mMOM}$ scheme at the $\mathcal{O}(a^3_s)$
level the $\beta$-factorization is valid for three values of the gauge parameter $\xi$ only, namely
for $\xi=-3, -1$ and $\xi=0$. In the $\mathcal{O}(a^4_s)$ order of PT it remains valid only for case
of the Landau gauge $\xi=0$. The consideration of these two schemes for the QCD GCR allows us to conclude
that the factorization of RG $\beta$-function will always be implemented in any $\rm{MOM}$-like
schemes with linear covariant gauge at $\xi=0$ and $\xi=-3$ at the $\mathcal{O}(a^3_s)$ level.
It is demonstrated that if factorization property for the $\rm{MS}$-like schemes is true in all
orders of PT, as theoretically indicated, then the factorization will also occur in the arbitrary
$\rm{MOM}$-like scheme in the Landau gauge in all orders of PT as well.
