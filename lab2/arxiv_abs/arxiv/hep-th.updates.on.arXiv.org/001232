We study the spherical collapse model in the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scenario of dynamical dark
energy. The DBI action is included in the class of $k$-essence models, and it has an important role
in describing the effective degrees of freedom of D-branes in the string theory. In the DBI setup,
we take the anti-de Sitter (AdS) warp factor $f(\phi)=f_0\, \phi^{-4}$, and investigate the self-interacting
quartic potential $V(\phi)=\lambda\phi^{4}/4$. The sound speed $c_s$ of the scalar perturbations
can evolve with time in our model. In addition, this setup make it possible for dark energy to cluster.
We examine the growth of the perturbations in both the linear and non-linear regimes. In the linear
regime, we apply the Pseudo-Newtonian formalism, and show that dark energy suppresses the growth
of perturbations at low redshifts. We apply the full expression of effective sound speed in our calculations,
and show that it is very close to the adiabatic sound speed during all the cosmological evolution.
From study the Integrated Sachs-Wolf (ISW) effect in our setup, we see that the model manifests some
deviation from the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In the non-linear regime, we follow the approach
of spherical collapse model, and calculate the linear overdensity $\delta_c(z_c)$, the virial
overdensity $\Delta_{\rm vir}(z_c)$, overdensity at the turn around $\zeta(z_c)$ and the rate
of expansion of collapsed region $h_{\rm ta}(z)$. Our results imply that the provided values of
$\delta_c(z_c)$, $\Delta_{\rm vir}(z_c)$, $\zeta(z_c)$ and $h_{\rm ta}(z)$ in our clustering
DBI dark energy model approach the fiducial value in the EdS universe at high enough redshifts. We
further compute relative number density of halo objects above a given mass in our setting, and show
that the number of structures with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model is reduced more in the high mass
tail at high redshifts.
