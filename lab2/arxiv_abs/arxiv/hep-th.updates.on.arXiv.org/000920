The physics of M5 branes placed near an M9 plane on an A-type ALE singularity exhibits a variety of
phenomena that introduce additional massless degrees of freedom. There are tensionless strings
whenever two M5 branes coincide or whenever an M5 brane approaches the M9 plane. These systems do
not admit a low-energy Lagrangian description so new techniques are desirable to shed light on the
physics of these phenomena. The 6-dimensional N=(1,0) world-volume theory on the M5 branes is composed
of massless vector, tensor, and hyper multiplets, and has two branches of the vacuum moduli space
where either the scalar fields in the tensor or hyper multiplets receive vacuum expectation values.
Focusing on the Higgs branch of the low-energy theory, previous works suggest the conjecture that
a new Higgs branch arises whenever a BPS-string becomes tensionless. Consequently, a single theory
admits a multitude of Higgs branches depending on the types of tensionless strings in the spectrum.
The two main phenomena discrete gauging and small E8 instanton transition can be treated in a concise
and effective manner by means of Coulomb branches of 3-dimensional N=4 gauge theories. In this paper,
a formalism is introduced that allows to derive a novel object from a brane configuration, called
the magnetic quiver. The main features are as follows: (i) the 3d Coulomb branch of the magnetic quiver
yields the Higgs branch of the 6d system, (ii) all discrete gauging and E8 instanton transitions
have an explicit brane realisation, and (iii) exceptional symmetries arise directly from brane
configurations. The formalism facilitates the description of Higgs branches at finite and infinite
gauge coupling as spaces of dressed monopole operators.
