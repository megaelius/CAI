Bouncing scenarios offer an alternative to the inflationary paradigm for the generation of perturbations
in the early universe. Recently, there has been a surge in interest in examining the issue of primordial
magnetogenesis in the context of bouncing universes. As in the case of inflation, the conformal
invariance of the electromagnetic action needs to be broken in bouncing scenarios in order to generate
primordial magnetic fields which correspond to observed strengths today. The non-minimal coupling,
which typically depends on a scalar field that possibly drives the homogeneous background, leads
to a cross-correlation at the level of the three-point function between the perturbation in the
scalar field and the magnetic fields. This has been studied in some detail in the context of inflation
and, specifically, it has been established that the three-point function satisfies the so-called
consistency relation in the squeezed limit. In this work, we study the cross-correlation between
the magnetic fields and the perturbation in an auxiliary scalar field in a certain class of bouncing
scenarios. We consider couplings that lead to scale invariant spectra of the magnetic field and
evaluate the corresponding cross-correlation between the magnetic field and the perturbation
in the scalar field. We find that, when compared to de Sitter inflation, the dimensionless non-Gaussianity
parameter that characterizes the amplitude of the cross-correlations proves to be considerably
larger in bouncing scenarios. We also show that the aforementioned consistency condition governing
the cross-correlation is violated in the bouncing models. We discuss the implications of our results.
