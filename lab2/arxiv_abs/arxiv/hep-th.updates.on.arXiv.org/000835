Bell's inequality was originally derived under the assumption that experimenters are free to select
detector settings independently of any local "hidden variables" that might affect the outcomes
of measurements on entangled particles. This assumption has come to be known as "measurement independence"
(also referred to as "freedom of choice" or "settings independence"). For a two-setting, two-outcome
Bell test, we derive modified Bell inequalities that relax measurement independence, for either
or both observers, while remaining locally causal. We describe the loss of measurement independence
for each observer using the parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$, as defined by Hall in 2010, and also by a more
complete description that adds two new parameters, which we call $\hat{M}_1$ and $\hat{M}_2$,
deriving a modified Bell inequality for each description. These "relaxed" inequalities subsume
those considered in previous work as special cases, and quantify how much the assumption of measurement
independence needs to be relaxed in order for a locally causal model to produce a given violation
of the standard Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequality. We show that both relaxed
Bell inequalities are tight bounds on the CHSH parameter by constructing locally causal models
that saturate them. For any given Bell inequality violation, the new two-parameter and four-parameter
models each require significantly less mutual information between the hidden variables and measurement
settings than previous models. We conjecture that the new models, with optimal parameters, require
the minimum possible mutual information for a given Bell violation. We further argue that, contrary
to various claims in the literature, relaxing freedom of choice need not imply superdeterminism.
