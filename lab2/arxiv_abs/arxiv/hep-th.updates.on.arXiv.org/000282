The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) and polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pSZ) effects are temperature
and polarization anisotropies induced by the scattering of CMB photons from structure in the post-reionization
Universe. In the case of the kSZ effect, small angular scale anisotropies in the optical depth are
modulated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole field, e.g. the CMB dipole observed at
each spacetime point. In the case of the pSZ effect, similar small-scale anisotropies are modulated
by the CMB quadrupole field, which receives contributions from both scalar and tensor modes. Statistical
anisotropies in the cross correlations of CMB temperature and polarization with tracers of the
inhomogeneous distribution of electrons provide a means of isolating and reconstructing the dipole
and quadrupole fields. In this paper, we present a set of unbiased minimum variance quadratic estimators
for the reconstruction of the dipole and quadrupole fields, and forecast the ability of future CMB
experiments and large scale structure surveys to perform this reconstruction in the cosmic variance
limit. Consistent with previous work, we find that a high fidelity reconstruction of the dipole
and quadrupole fields over a variety of scales is indeed possible, and demonstrate the sensitivity
of the pSZ effect to primordial tensor modes. Using a principle component analysis, we estimate
how many independent modes could be accessed in such a reconstruction. We also comment on a few first
applications of a detection of the dipole and quadrupole fields, including a reconstruction of
the primordial contribution to our locally observed CMB dipole, a test of statistical homogeneity
on large scales from the first modes of the quadrupole field, and a reconstruction technique for
the primordial potential on the largest scales.
