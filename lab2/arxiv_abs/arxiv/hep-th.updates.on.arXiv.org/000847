The (complex) Hodge-elliptic genus and its conformal field theoretic counterpart were recently
introduced by Kachru and Tripathy, refining the traditional complex elliptic genus. We construct
a different, so-called chiral Hodge-elliptic genus, which is expected to agree with the generic
conformal field theoretic Hodge-elliptic genus, in contrast to the complex Hodge-elliptic genus
as originally defined. For K3 surfaces X, the chiral Hodge-elliptic genus is shown to be independent
of all moduli. Moreover, employing Kapustin's results on infinite volume limits it is shown that
it agrees with the generic conformal field theoretic Hodge-elliptic genus of K3 theories, while
the complex Hodge-elliptic genus does not. This new invariant governs part of the field content
of K3 theories, supporting the idea that all their spaces of states have a common subspace which underlies
the generic conformal field theoretic Hodge-elliptic genus, and thereby the complex elliptic
genus. Mathematically, this space is modelled by the sheaf cohomology of the chiral de Rham complex
of X. It decomposes into irreducible representations of the N=4 superconformal algebra such that
the multiplicity spaces of all massive representations have precisely the dimensions required
in order to furnish the representation of the Mathieu group M24 that is predicted by Mathieu Moonshine.
This is interpreted as evidence in favour of the ideas of symmetry surfing, which have been proposed
by Taormina and the author, along with the claim that the sheaf cohomology of the chiral de Rham complex
is a natural home for Mathieu Moonshine. These investigations also imply that the generic chiral
algebra of K3 theories is precisely the N=4 superconformal algebra at central charge c=6, if the
usual predictions on infinite volume limits from string theory hold true.
