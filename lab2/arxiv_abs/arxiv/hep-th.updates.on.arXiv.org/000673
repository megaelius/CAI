Boundaries in gauge theories are a delicate issue. We approach it through a geometric formalism
based on the space of field configurations (field-space). Our main geometric tool is a connection
1-form on field-space, $\varpi$, which we introduce and explore in detail. Using it, we upgrade
the presymplectic structure of Yang-Mills theory with boundaries to be invariant even under field-dependent
gauge transformations. The gauge charges always vanish, while global charges still arise for configurations
with global symmetries. The formalism is powerful because it is relational: the field-content
itself is used as a reference frame to distinguish `gauge' and `physical'; no new degrees of freedom
(e.g. group-valued edge modes) are required. Different choices of reference fields give different
$\varpi$'s, which are related to gauge-fixings such as Higgs unitary and Coulomb gauge. But the
formalism extends well beyond gauge-fixings, for instance by avoiding the Gribov problem. For
one choice of $\varpi$, Goldstone modes arising from the condensation of matter degrees of freedom
play precisely the role of known edge modes. For another choice, $\varpi$ is related to non-Abelian
analogues of the Dirac dressing of the electron. Applied to the Lorentz symmetry of vielbein gravity,
our formalism explains the origin of previously known Lorentz-invariant constructions. Lastly,
we understand dressings as field-space Wilson lines for $\varpi$. We use the construction to unify
the Lavelle-McMullan dressing with the gauge-invariant fields of Gribov-Zwanziger and Vilkovisky-DeWitt,
and to put forward a notion of `historical dressing'.
