We classify time-reversal breaking topological crystalline insulators with crystallographic
non-magnetic (32 types) and magnetic (58 types) point groups. The classification includes all
possible magnetic topological crystalline insulators protected by point group symmetry. Whereas
the classification of topological insulators are known to be given by the We classify time-reversal
breaking topological crystalline insulators with crystallographic non-magnetic (32 types)
and magnetic (58 types) point groups. The classification includes all possible magnetic topological
crystalline insulators protected by point group symmetry. Whereas the classification of topological
insulators are known to be given by the K-theory in the momentum space, computation of the K-theory
has been a difficult task in the presence of complicated crystallographic symmetry. Here we consider
the K-homology in the real space for this problem, instead of the K-theory in the momentum space,
both of which give the same topological classification. We apply the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral
sequence (AHSS) for computation of the K-homology, which is a mathematical tool for generalized
(co)homology. In the real space picture, the AHSS naturally gives the classification of higher-order
topological insulators at the same time. By solving the group extension problem in the AHSS on the
basis of physical arguments, we completely determine possible topological phases including higher-order
ones for each point group. Relationships among different higher-order topological phases are
argued in terms of the AHSS in the K-homology. We find that in some nonmagnetic and magnetic point
groups, a stack of two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ second-order topological insulators can be smoothly deformed
into non-trivial fourth-order topological insulators, which implies non-trivial group extensions
in the AHSS.
