We present and analyze a class of exact spacetimes which describe accelerating black holes with
a NUT parameter. First, we verify that the intricate metric found by Chng, Mann and Stelea in 2006
indeed solves Einstein's vacuum field equations of General Relativity. We explicitly calculate
all components of the Weyl tensor and determine its algebraic structure. As it turns out, it is actually
of algebraically general type I with four distinct principal null directions. It explains why this
class of solutions has not been (and could not be) found within the large Plebanski-Demianski family
of type D spacetimes. Then we transform the solution into a much more convenient metric form which
explicitly depends on three physical parameters: mass, acceleration, and the NUT parameter. These
parameters can independently be set to zero, recovering thus the well-known spacetimes in standard
coordinates, namely the C-metric, the Taub-NUT metric, the Schwarzschild metric, and flat Minkowski
space. Using this new metric, we investigate physical and geometrical properties of such accelerating
NUT black holes. In particular, we localize and study four Killing horizons (two black-hole plus
two acceleration) and investigate the curvature. Employing the scalar invariants we prove that
there are no curvature singularities whenever the NUT parameter is nonzero. We identify asymptotically
flat regions and relate them to conformal infinities. This leads to a complete understanding of
the global structure. The boost-rotation metric form reveals that there is actually a pair of such
black holes. They uniformly accelerate in opposite directions due to the action of rotating cosmic
strings or struts located along the corresponding two axes. Rotation of these sources is directly
related to the NUT parameter. In their vicinity there are pathological regions with closed timelike
curves.
