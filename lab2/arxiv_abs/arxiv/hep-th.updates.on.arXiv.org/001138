Self-interacting massive particles with spin $\geq 1$ unavoidably violate unitarity; the question
is at what scale. For spin-$1$ the strong coupling scale (at which perturbative unitarity is lost)
cannot be raised by any finite tuning of the interactions, while for spin-$2$ there exists a special
tuning of the Wilson coefficients which can raise this scale (and enjoys numerous special properties
such as ghost-freedom). Here, we fill in the missing piece by describing how the self-interactions
of a massive spin-$3/2$ field, or "massive gravitino", become strongly coupled at high energies.
We show that while several different structures appear in the leading order potential, the strong
coupling scale cannot be raised (in the absence of additional fields). At the level of the off-shell
Lagrangian, it is always the non-linear symmetries of the longitudinal Stuckelberg mode that dictate
the strong coupling, and we show that in general it is only possible to parametrically raise the strong
coupling scale if Wess-Zumino structures exist. We complement this off-shell approach with a first
analysis of positivity bounds for a massive spin-$3/2$ particle, showing that any potential self-interaction
which contributes to an on-shell 2-to-2 elastic process at tree level must vanish if this low-energy
theory is to have a standard UV completion. We identify the mixing between the longitudinal mode
and the transverse modes as the main obstacle to positivity, and clarify how the non-Abelian nature
of non-linear (dRGT) massive gravity allows it to satisfy positivity where all known spin $\geq
3/2$ Abelian theories fail. Our results imply that a massive gravitino cannot appear alone in a controlled
EFT---it must be accompanied by other particles, e.g.~as part of a supermultiplet. Together with
the spin-$1$ and spin-$2$ cases, we suggest features which will persist in even higher spin massive
theories.
