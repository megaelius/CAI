Cosmography can be considered as a sort of a model-independent approach to tackle the dark energy/modified
gravity problem. In this review, the success and the shortcomings of the $\Lambda$CDM model, based
on General Relativity and standard model of particles, are discussed in view of the most recent observational
constraints. The motivations for considering extensions and modifications of General Relativity
are taken into account, with particular attention to $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ theories of gravity where
dynamics is represented by curvature or torsion field respectively. The features of $f(R)$ models
are explored in metric and Palatini formalisms. We discuss the connection between $f(R)$ gravity
and scalar-tensor theories highlighting the role of conformal transformations in the Einstein
and Jordan frames. Cosmological dynamics of $f(R)$ models is investigated through the corresponding
viability criteria. Afterwards, the equivalent formulation of General Relativity (Teleparallel
Equivalent General Relativity) in terms of torsion and its extension to $f(T)$ gravity is considered.
Finally, the cosmographic method is adopted to break the degeneracy among dark energy models. A
novel approach, built upon rational Pad\'e and Chebyshev polynomials, is proposed to overcome
limits of standard cosmography based on Taylor expansion. The approach provides accurate model-independent
approximations of the Hubble flow. Numerical analyses, based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain integration
of cosmic data, are presented to bound coefficients of the cosmographic series. These techniques
are thus applied to reconstruct $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ functions and to frame the late-time expansion
history of the universe with no \emph{a priori} assumptions on its equation of state. A comparison
between the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ models is reported.
