We propose a new analogue model of gravity - the evolving quark gluon plasma (QGP) produced in relativistic
heavy ion collisions. This quark gluon plasma is the "most inviscid" fluid known. Such low kinematic
viscosity is believed to reflect strongly correlated nature for QGP in these experiments. Hence,
it may provide a good example of a quantum fluid naturally suited to studies of acoustic Hawking radiation.
Due to rapid longitudinal expansion, presence of a sonic horizon is also naturally guaranteed here,
though, in general, this horizon is not static. Using Ultra relativistic quantum molecular dynamics
(UrQMD) simulations, we show that, under certain conditions, the longitudinal velocity of the
plasma, near the sonic horizon, can become time independent for a short span during the evolution
of the system. During this period, we can have a conformally static acoustic metric with a (conformal)
Killing horizon coinciding with the apparent horizon. An asymptotic observer will then see a thermal
flux of phonons, constituting the Hawking radiation, coming from the horizon. For the relatively
low energy collision considered here, where the resulting QCD system is governed by non-relativistic
hydrodynamics, we estimate the Hawking temperature to be about 4-5 MeV (with the temperature of
the QCD fluid being about 135 MeV). We discuss the experimental signatures of this Hawking radiation
in terms of a thermal component in the rapidity dependence of the transverse momentum distribution
of detected particles. We also discuss extension to ultra-relativistic case which should lead
to a higher Hawking temperature, along with the effects of dynamical horizon leading to blue/red
shift of the temperature.
