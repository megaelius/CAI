This thesis is devoted to various aspects of electric-magnetic duality and its gravitational generalization,
with an emphasis on the case of maximal supergravity. It is divided into three parts. In the first
part, we review the the Cremmer-Julia "hidden" symmetries of maximal supergravity in various dimensions.
Two new results are obtained: we prove that those symmetries appear if and only if the Chern-Simons
coupling of the $D=11$ theory takes the value predicted by supersymmetry, and we obtain a manifestly
$E_{7(7)}$-invariant formula for the entropy of non-extremal black holes in $D=4$, $N=8$ supergravity.
The second part is motivated by supergravity gaugings. We examine through BRST methods the local
deformations of non-minimally coupled scalars and abelian vector fields in four dimensions. We
prove that they are all of the usual Yang-Mills type, i.e., correspond to the gauging of some rigid
symmetries of the undeformed theory. We also show that other Lagragians considered in the literature,
containing additional fields, do not allow for gaugings that cannot be reached starting from the
usual Lagrangian. In the third part, we construct self-contained action principles for several
self-dual free fields in six dimensions. These fields are motivated by two considerations: they
allow for a geometric interpretation of the electric-magnetic duality symmetries of linearized
gravity in four dimensions, and they also appear in the spectrum of the chiral $N=(4,0)$ and $N=(3,1)$
"exotic supergravities" in place of a metric. The free action and supersymmetry transformations
for those theories are then explicitly constructed. We check that they reduce to linearized maximal
supergravity in five dimensions, and also generalize previous works on linearized supergravity
by other authors in which the graviton and its dual appear on the same footing at the level of the action.
