Three dimensional, $U(N)$ symmetric, field theory with fermion matter coupled to a topological
Chern--Simons term, in the large $N$ limit is analyzed in details. We determine the conditions for
the existence of a massless conformal invariant ground state as well as the conditions for a massive
phase. We analyze the phase structure and calculate gauge invariant corelators comparing them
in several cases to existing results. In addition to the non-critical explicitly broken scale invariance
massive case we consider also a massive ground state where the scale symmetry is spontaneously broken.
We show that such a phase appears only in the presence of a marginal deformation that is introduced
by adding a certain scalar auxiliary field. The ground state contains in this case a massless $U(N)$
singlet bound state goldstone boson- the dilaton whose properties are determined. We employ here
the temporal gauge which is at variance with respect to past calculations using the light-cone gauge
and thus, a check (though limited) of gauge independence is at hand. The large $N$ properties are
determined by using a field integral formalism and the steepest descent method. The saddle point
equations, which take here the form of integral equations for non-local fields, determine the mass
gap and the dressed fermion propagator. Vertex functions are calculated at leading order in $1/N$
as exact solutions of integral equations. From the vertex functions, we infer gauge invariant two-point
correlation functions for scalar operators and a current. Indications about the consistency of
the method are obtained by verifying that gauge-invariant quantities have a natural $O(3)$ covariant
form. As a further verification, in several occasions, a few terms of the perturbative expansion
are calculated and compared with the exact results in the appropriate order.
