We study the behaviour of weak gravitational fields in the 6D Cascading DGP model using a bulk-based
approach. To deal with the ambiguity in the thin limit of branes of codimension higher than one, we
consider a specific regularization of the internal structure of the branes where the 5D brane can
be considered thin with respect to the 4D one. We consider the solutions corresponding to pure tension
sources on the 4D brane, and study perturbations at first order around these background solutions.
We adopt a 4D scalar-vector-tensor decomposition, and focus on the scalar sector of perturbations.
We show that, in a suitable 4D limit, the trace part of the 4D metric perturbations obeys a decoupled
equation which suggests that it is a ghost for background tensions smaller than a critical tension,
while it is a healthy field otherwise. We give a geometrical interpretation of the existence of the
critical tension and of the reason why the relevant field is a ghost or not depending on the background
tension. We however find a value of the critical tension which is different from the one already found
in the literature. Differently from the results in the literature, our analysis implies that, choosing
the background tension suitably, we can construct ghost-free models for any value of the free parameters
of the theory. We suggest that the difference lies in the procedure used to evaluate the pillbox integration
across the codimension-2 brane. We confirm the validity of our analysis by performing numerically
the integration in a particular case where the solution inside the thick cod-2 brane is known exactly.
We stress that the singular structure of the perturbation fields in the nested branes set-ups is
very subtle, and that great care has to be taken when deriving the codimension-2 junction conditions.
