To understand better the quantum structure of field theory and standard model in particle physics,
it is necessary to investigate carefully the divergence structure in quantum field theories (QFTs)
and work out a consistent framework to avoid infinities. The divergence has got us into trouble since
developing quantum electrodynamics in 1930s, its treatment via the renormalization scheme is
satisfied not by all physicists, like Dirac and Feynman who have made serious criticisms. The renormalization
group analysis reveals that QFTs can in general be defined fundamentally with the meaningful energy
scale that has some physical significance, which motivates us to develop a new symmetry-preserving
and infinity-free regularization scheme called loop regularization (LORE). A simple regularization
prescription in LORE is realized based on a manifest postulation that a loop divergence with a power
counting dimension larger than or equal to the space-time dimension must vanish. The LORE method
is achieved without modifying original theory and leads the divergent Feynman loop integrals well-defined
to maintain the divergence structure and meanwhile preserve basic symmetries of original theory.
The crucial point in LORE is the presence of two intrinsic energy scales which play the roles of ultraviolet
cut-off $M_c$ and infrared cut-off $\mu_s$ to avoid infinities. The key concept in LORE is the introduction
of irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) on which the regularization prescription acts, which leads
to a set of gauge invariance consistency conditions between the regularized tensor-type and scalar-type
ILIs. The evaluation of ILIs with ultraviolet-divergence-preserving (UVDP) parametrization
naturally leads to Bjorken-Drell's analogy between Feynman diagrams and electric circuits. The
LORE method has been shown to be applicable to both underlying and effective QFTs.
