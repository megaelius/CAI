We consider compactifications of $6d$ minimal $(D_{N+3},D_{N+3})$ type conformal matter SCFTs
on a generic Riemann surface. We derive the theories corresponding to three punctured spheres (trinions)
with three maximal punctures, from which one can construct models corresponding to generic surfaces.
The trinion models are simple quiver theories with $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(2)$ gauge nodes. One of
the three puncture non abelian symmetries is emergent in the IR. The derivation of the trinions proceeds
by analyzing RG flows between conformal matter SCFTs with different values of $N$ and relations
between their subsequent reductions to $4d$. In particular, using the flows we first derive trinions
with two maximal and one minimal punctures, and then we argue that collections of $N$ minimal punctures
can be interpreted as a maximal one. This suggestion is checked by matching the properties of the
$4d$ models such as `t Hooft anomalies, symmetries, and the structure of the conformal manifold
to the expectations from $6d$. We then use the understanding that collections of minimal punctures
might be equivalent to maximal ones to construct trinions with three maximal punctures, and then
$4d$ theories corresponding to arbitrary surfaces, for $6d$ models described by two $M5$ branes
probing a $\mathbb{Z}_k$ singularity. This entails the introduction of a novel type of maximal
puncture. Again, the suggestion is checked by matching anomalies, symmetries and the conformal
manifold to expectations from six dimensions. These constructions thus give us a detailed understanding
of compactifications of two sequences of six dimensional SCFTs to four dimensions.
