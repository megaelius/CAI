Classicalization is a phenomenon of redistribution of energy - initially stored in few hard quanta
- into the high occupation numbers of the soft modes, described by a final state that is approximately
classical. Using an effective Hamiltonian, we first show why the transition amplitudes that increase
occupation numbers are exponentially suppressed and how a very special family of classicalizing
theories compensates this suppression. This is thanks to a large micro-state entropy generated
by the emergent gapless modes around the final classical state. The dressing of the process by the
super-soft quanta of these modes compensates the exponential suppression of the transition probability.
Hence, an unsuppressed classicalization takes place exclusively into the states of exponentially
enhanced memory storage capacity. Next, we describe this phenomenon in the language of a quantum
neural network, in which the neurons are represented as interconnected quantum modes with gravity-like
negative-energy synaptic connections. We show that upon an injection of energy in form of a hard
quantum stimulus, the network reaches the classicalized state of exponentially enhanced memory
capacity with order one probability. We construct a simple model in which the transition results
into classical states that carry an area-law micro-state entropy. In this language, a non-Wilsonian
UV-completion of the Standard Model via classicalization implies that above cutoff energy the
theory operates as a brain network that softens the high energy quanta by bringing itself into the
state of a maximal memory capacity. A similar interpretation applies to black hole formation in
particle collision.
