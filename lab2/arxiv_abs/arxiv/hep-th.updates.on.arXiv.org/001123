The idea of breaking time-translation symmetry has fascinated humanity at least since ancient
proposals of the perpetuum mobile. Unlike the breaking of other symmetries, such as spatial translation
in a crystal or spin rotation in a magnet, time translation symmetry breaking (TTSB) has been tantalisingly
elusive. We review this history up to recent developments which have shown that discrete TTSB does
takes place in periodically driven (Floquet) systems in the presence of many-body localization.
Such Floquet time-crystals represent a new paradigm in quantum statistical mechanics --- that
of an intrinsically out-of-equilibrium many-body phase of matter. We include a compendium of necessary
background, before specializing to a detailed discussion of the nature, and diagnostics, of TTSB.
We formalize the notion of a time-crystal as a stable, macroscopic, conservative clock --- explaining
both the need for a many-body system in the infinite volume limit, and for a lack of net energy absorption
or dissipation. We also cover a range of related phenomena, including various types of long-lived
prethermal time-crystals, and expose the roles played by symmetries -- exact and (emergent) approximate
-- and their breaking. We clarify the distinctions between many-body time-crystals and other ostensibly
similar phenomena dating as far back as the works of Faraday and Mathieu. En route, we encounter Wilczek's
suggestion that macroscopic systems should exhibit TTSB in their ground states, together with
a theorem ruling this out. We also analyze pioneering recent experiments detecting signatures
of time crystallinity in a variety of different platforms, and provide a detailed theoretical explanation
of the physics in each case. In all existing experiments, the system does not realize a `true' time-crystal
phase, and we identify necessary ingredients for improvements in future experiments.
