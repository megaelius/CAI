A self-consistent exposition of the theory of tree-level superamplitudes of the 4d N=4 and 6d N=(1,1)
maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is provided. In 4d we work in non-chiral superspace
and construct the superconformal and dual superconformal symmetry generators of the N=4 SYM theory
using the non-chiral BCFW recursion to prove the latter. In 6d we provide a complete derivation of
the standard and hidden symmetries of the tree-level superamplitudes of N=(1,1) SYM theory, again
using the BCFW recursion to prove the dual conformal symmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
compact analytical formulae for tree-superamplitudes in N=(1,1) SYM can be obtained from a numerical
implementation of the supersymmetric BCFW recursion relation. We derive compact manifestly dual
conformal representations of the five- and six-point superamplitudes as well as arbitrary multiplicity
formulae valid for certain classes of superamplitudes related to ultra-helicity-violating massive
amplitudes in 4d. We study massive tree superamplitudes on the Coulomb branch of the N=4 SYM theory
from dimensional reduction of the massless superamplitudes of the six-dimensional N=(1,1) SYM
theory. We exploit this correspondence to construct the super-Poincare and enhanced dual conformal
symmetries of massive tree superamplitudes in N=4 SYM theory which are shown to close into a finite
dimensional algebra of Yangian type. Finally, we address the fascinating possibility of uplifting
massless 4d superamplitudes to 6d massless superamplitudes proposed by Huang. We confirm the uplift
for multiplicities up to eight but show that finding the uplift is highly non-trivial and in fact
not of a practical use for multiplicities larger than five.
