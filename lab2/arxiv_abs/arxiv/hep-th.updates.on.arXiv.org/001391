We describe 4D evaporating black holes as quantum field configurations by solving the semi-classical
Einstein equation $G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi G \langle \psi|T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle$ and quantum matter
fields in a self-consistent manner. As the matter fields we consider $N$ massless free scalar fields
($N$ is large). We find a spherically symmetric self-consistent solution of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$
and state $|\psi\rangle$. Here, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is locally $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry, and $|\psi\rangle$
provides $\langle \psi|T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle=\langle0|T_{\mu\nu}|0 \rangle+T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$,
where $|0\rangle$ is the ground state of the matter fields in the metric and $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$
consists of the excitation of s-waves that describe the collapsing matter and Hawking radiation
with the ingoing negative energy flow. This object is supported by a large tangential pressure $\langle0|T^\theta{}_\theta|0
\rangle$ due to the vacuum fluctuation of the bound modes with large angular momenta. This describes
the interior of the black hole when the back reaction of the evaporation is considered. The black
hole is a compact object with a surface (instead of horizon) that looks like a conventional black
hole from the outside and eventually evaporates without a singularity. If we count the number of
self-consistent configurations $\{|\psi\rangle\}$, we reproduce the area law of the entropy.
This tells that the information is carried by the s-waves inside the black hole. $|\psi\rangle$
also describes the process that the negative ingoing energy flow created with Hawking radiation
is superposed on the collapsing matter to decrease the total energy while the total energy density
remains positive. As a special case, we consider conformal matter fields and show that the interior
metric is determined by the matter content of the theory, which leads to a new constraint to the matter
content.
