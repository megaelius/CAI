The fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDR) are powerful relations which can capture the essence
of the interplay between a system and its environment. Challenging problems of this nature which
FDRs aid in our understanding include the backreaction of quantum field processes like particle
creation on the spacetime dynamics in early universe cosmology or quantum black holes. The less
familiar, yet equally important correlation-propagation relations (CPR) relate the correlations
of stochastic forces on different detectors to the retarded and advanced parts of the radiation
propagated in the field. Here, we analyze a system of $N$ uniformly-accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors
whose internal degrees of freedom (idf) are minimally coupled to a real, massless, scalar field
in 4D Minkowski space, extending prior work in 2D with derivative coupling. Using the influence
functional formalism, we derive the stochastic equations describing the nonequilibrium dynamics
of the idfs. We show after the detector-field dynamics has reached equilibration the existence
of the FDR and the CPR for the detectors, which combine to form a {\it generalized} fluctuation-dissipation
matrix relation We show explicitly the energy flows between the constituents of the system of detectors
and between the system and the quantum field environment. This power balance anchors the generalized
FDR. We anticipate this matrix relation to provide a useful guardrail in expounding some basic issues
in relativistic quantum information, such as ensuring the self-consistency of the energy balance
and tracking the quantum information transfer in the detector-field system.
