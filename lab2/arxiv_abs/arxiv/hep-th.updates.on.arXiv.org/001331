The present thesis aimed to examine the effects of vorticity on the thermodynamics of relativistic
quantum systems. We extend the Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator method to address
quantum effects induced by vorticity in the presence of chiral matter and external electromagnetic
field and keeping full covariant and quantum properties of the system. To investigate the effects
of vorticity, this work has been focused on systems consisting of massless chiral fermions. We recovered
the significant quantum phenomena known in the literature, namely the chiral magnetic effect,
the chiral vortical effect, the axial vortical effect and the chiral separation effect and we also
revealed the presence of additional effects at second-order on thermal vorticity. This study has
also identified and presented the exact solutions of thermal states for a system at global thermal
equilibrium consisting of chiral massless fermions under the action of an external constant homogeneous
magnetic field. Taking advantage of these exact solutions and conservation equations, the study
also proved that the thermal coefficients related to first-order effects on thermal vorticity
do not receive corrections from the external electromagnetic field. The same argument revealed
existing relations between those thermal coefficients, even connecting coefficients related
to vorticity to other related to electromagnetic field. For instance, this analysis has found that
the chiral vortical effect and the chiral magnetic effect conductivities are connected one to the
other by a differential equation. Therefore, this research provides the first steps into deriving
the relations between the effects and the interplay of electromagnetic fields and vorticity.
