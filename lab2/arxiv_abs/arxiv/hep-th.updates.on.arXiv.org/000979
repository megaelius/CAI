We propose a simple non-supersymmetric grand unified theory (GUT) based on the gauge group $SO(10)
\times U(1)_\psi$. The model includes 3 generations of fermions in ${\bf 16}$ ($+1$), ${\bf 10}$
($-2$) and ${\bf 1}$ ($+4$) representations. The ${\bf 16}$-plets contain Standard Model (SM)
fermions plus right-handed neutrinos, and the ${\bf 10}$-plet and the singlet fermions are introduced
to make the model anomaly-free. Gauge coupling unification at $M_{GUT} \simeq 5 \times 10^{15}-10^{16}$
GeV is achieved by including an intermediate Pati-Salam breaking at $M_{I} \simeq 10^{12}-10^{11}$
GeV, which is a natural scale for the seesaw mechanism. For $M_{I} \simeq 10^{12}-10^{11}$, proton
decay will be tested by the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. The extra fermions acquire their masses
from $U(1)_\psi$ symmetry breaking, and a $U(1)_\psi$ Higgs field drives a successful inflection-point
inflation with a low Hubble parameter during inflation, $H_{inf} \ll M_{I}$. Hence, cosmologically
dangerous monopoles produced from $SO(10)$ and PS breakings are diluted away. The reheating temperature
after inflation can be high enough for successful leptogenesis. With the Higgs field contents of
our model, a ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry remains unbroken after GUT symmetry breaking, and the lightest
mass eigenstate among linear combinations of the ${\bf 10}$-plet and the singlet fermions serves
as a Higgs-portal dark matter (DM). We identify the parameter regions to reproduce the observed
DM relic density while satisfying the current constraint from the direct DM detection experiments.
The present allowed region will be fully covered by the future direct detection experiments such
as LUX-ZEPLIN DM experiment. In the presence of the extra fermions, the SM Higgs potential is stabilized
up to $M_{I}$.
