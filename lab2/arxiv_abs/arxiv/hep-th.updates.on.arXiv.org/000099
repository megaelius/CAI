We propose a method to construct on-shell component actions for theories with 1/2 partial breaking
of global supersymmetry within the nonlinear realization (coset) approach. In contrast with the
standard superfield approach in which unbroken supersymmetry plays the leading role, we have shifted
the attention to the spontaneously broken supersymmetry. It turns out that in theories in which
half of supersymmetries is spontaneously broken, all physical fermions are just the fermions of
the nonlinear realization. Moreover, transformation properties of these fermions with respect
to broken supersymmetry are the same as in the Volkov-Akulov model. Just this completely fixed all
possible appearances of fermions in the component action: they can enter the action through the
determinant of the vielbein and covariant derivatives, only. In our parametrization of the coset
the rest of physical components, i.e. all bosonic components, transform as "matter fields" with
respect to broken supersymmetry. Clearly, the component action acquires the form of the Volkov-Akulov
action for these "matter fields". The complete form of the action can be further fixed by two additional
requirements: a) to reproduce the bosonic limit, which is explicitly known in many interesting
cases, and b) to have a proper linearized form, which has to be invariant with respect to linearized
unbroken supersymmetry. In some cases additional Wess-Zumino terms (which disappear in the bosonic
limit) have to be added to the action. We supply the general consideration by detailed examples of
actions for the superparticle in D=3,5, the on-shell component action for N=1, D=5 supermembrane
and its dual cousins and the component action of N=1 supermembrane in D=4, providing the exact proof
of the invariance of the constructed component actions with respect to both broken and unbroken
supersymmetries.
