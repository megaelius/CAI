In a celebrated series of papers, D. Freed, M. Hopkins and C. Teleman proved that the fusion ring of
the loop group over a compact, simply connected Lie group $\mathbb{G}$ at level $k$ can be described
as the equivariant twisted $K$-theory ring ${}^\tau K_{\mathbb{G}}^{\dim\mathbb{G}}(\mathbb{G})$,
where $\mathbb{G}$ acts on itself by conjugation and the twist $\tau$ depends on the level. In other
words, it can be described via equivariant bundles of compact operators over $\mathbb{G}$. In this
paper, the authors take a different approach to these fusion rings, which also arise from Wess-Zumino-Witten
models in conformal field theory. Their long-term goal is to describe the fusion ring via the equivariant
$K$-theory of $M_{n}(\mathbb{C})^{\otimes\infty}$ under an action of the quantum group $\mathbb{G}_q$
for $q$ a root of unity, the idea being that the twist in the Freed-Hopkins-Teleman picture is captured
by the non-commutativity of $M_{n}(\mathbb{C})^{\otimes\infty}$ and the deformation parameter
$q$. As a step in this direction, the authors compute the $K$-theory of certain approximately finite
dimensional $C^*$-algebras that can be viewed as fixed point algebras under $\mathbb{G}_q$ or,
more rigorously, arise from corresponding towers of relative commutants of a subfactor (axiomatized
either via the $\lambda$-lattices of S. Popa, the paragroups of A. Ocneanu, or the planar algebras
of V. F. R. Jones), for $\mathbb{G} = \mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathbb{G} = \mathrm{SU}(3)$, and relate
them, together with their natural ring structure, to the aforementioned fusion rings. We also comment
on the other rank 2 Lie groups $\mathrm{G}_2$ and $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$.
