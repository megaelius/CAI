We investigate stationary scaling states of Burgers' and Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE). The
path integral representation of the steady state of the stochastic Burgers equation is used in order
to investigate the scaling solutions of the system at renormalisation group (RG) fixed points.
We employ the functional RG in order to access the non-perturbative regime. We devise an approximation
that respects Galilei invariance and is designed to resolve the frequency and momentum dependence
of low order correlation functions. We establish a set of RG fixed point equations for inverse propagators
with an arbitrary frequency and momentum dependence. In all spatial dimensions they yield a continuum
of fixed points as well as an isolated one. These results are fully compatible with the existing literature
for $d=1$. For $d\neq1$ however results of the literature focus almost exclusively on irrotational
solutions while the solutions that our approximation can capture contain necessarily vorticity
and are closer to Navier-Stokes turbulence. Non-equilibrium steady states of ultra-cold Bose
gases coupled to external baths of energy and particles such as exciton-polariton condensates
are related to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) dynamics. We postulate that the scaling that we obtain
in this context applies as well to far-from-equilibrium quasi-stationary states (non-thermal
fixed points) of the closed system described by the GPE. We translate results found in the KPZ literature
to their corresponding dual in the ultra-cold Bose gas set-up. We find that this provides a new scaling
relation which can be used to analytically identify the classical Kolmogorov -5/3 exponent and
its anomalous correction. Moreover we estimate the anomalous correction to the scaling exponent
of the compressible part of the kinetic energy spectrum of the Bose gas which is confirmed by numerical
simulations of the GPE.
