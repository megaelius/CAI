In the context of holographic duality with AdS3 asymptotics, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula states
that the entanglement entropy of a subregion is given by the length of a certain bulk geodesic. The
entanglement entropy can be operationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the
state of the subregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a reference
party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other bulk curves can be interpreted
as entanglement costs for some other information theoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing
that the length of more general bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce
a new task called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary subregion must be
transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale in a way determined by the geometry
of the bulk curve. Our main result is that the cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions
of constrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the signed length of
the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative, constrained state merging distills entanglement
rather than consuming it. This demonstration has two parts: first, we exhibit a protocol whose cost
is the length of the curve and second, we prove that this protocol is optimal in that it uses the minimum
amount of entanglement. In order to complete the proof, we additionally demonstrate that single-shot
smooth conditional entropies for intervals in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories with
large central charge are well approximated by their von Neumann counterparts. We also revisit the
relationship between the differential entropy and the maximum entropy among locally consistent
density operators, demonstrating large quantitative discrepancy between the two quantities
in conformal field theories.
