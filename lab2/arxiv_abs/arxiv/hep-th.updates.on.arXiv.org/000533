We study $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory on the Coulomb branch (cSYM) in the strong coupling
limit by using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The dual geometry is the rotating black 3-brane Type
IIB supergravity solution with a single non-zero rotation parameter $r_{0}$ which sets a fixed
mass scale corresponding to the scalar condensate $<\mathcal{O}>\,\,\sim r_{0}^4$ in the Coulomb
branch. We introduce a new ensemble where $T$ and $r_{0}$ are held fixed. We compute the equation
of state (EoS) of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ cSYM at finite $T$, as well as the heavy quark-antiquark potential
and the quantized mass spectrums of the scalar and spin-2 glueballs at $T=0$. By computing the Wilson
loop (minimal surface) at $T=0$, we determine the heavy quark-antiquark potential $V(L)$ to be
the Cornell potential, which is confining for large separation $L$. At $T\neq 0$, we find two black
hole branches: the large black hole and small black hole branches. For the large black hole branch,
that has positive specific heat, we find qualitatively similar EoS to that of pure Yang-Mills theory
on the lattice. For the small black hole branch, that has negative specific heat, we find an EoS where
the entropy and energy densities decrease with $T$. Moreover, we argue that the small black hole
branch is dynamically stable, i.e., it doesn't suffer from Gregory and Laflamme (GL) instability.
Finally, we propose a formula which relates the Hawking radiation rate from the large black hole
branch (at $T=T_{freez-out}=T_{min}$) with the thermal hadron emission rate in $\mathcal{N}
= 4$ cSYM plasma (at $T=T_{freez-out}=T_{min}$). Our formula, in the hydrodynamic limit, reduces
to Cooper-Frye formula in the local rest frame, and is also applicable to other confining gauge theories.
