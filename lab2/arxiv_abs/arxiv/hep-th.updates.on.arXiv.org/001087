Due to the absence of a transverse expansion with respect to the beam direction, the Bjorken flow
is unable to describe certain observables in heavy ion collisions. This caveat has motivated the
introduction of analytical relativistic hydrodynamics (RH) solutions with transverse expansion,
in particular, the 3+1 self-similar (SSF) and Gubser flows. Inspired by recent generalizations
of the Bjorken flow to the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), we present a procedure for
a generalization of RH solutions to RMHD. Our method is mainly based on symmetry arguments. Using
this method, we find the relation between RH degrees of freedom and the magnetic field evolution
in the ideal limit for an infinitely conductive fluid, and determine the proper time dependence
of the magnetic field in aforementioned flows. In the case of SSF, a family of solutions are found
that are related through a certain differential equation. To find the magnetic field evolution
in the Gubser flow, we solve RMHD equations for a stationary fluid in a conformally flat $dS^3\times
E^1$ spacetime. The result is then Weyl transformed back into the Minkowski spacetime. In this case,
the temporal evolution of the magnetic field exhibits a transmission between $1/t$ to $1/t^3$ near
the center of the collision. The longitudinal component of the magnetic field is found to be sensitive
to the transverse size of the fluid. We also find the radial evolution of the magnetic field for both
flows. The radial domain of validity in the case of SSF is highly restricted, in contrast to the Gubser
flow. A comparison of the results suggests that the Gubser RMHD may give a more appropriate qualitative
picture of the magnetic field decay in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).
