We study the dynamics of inflation in a generalized scalar-torsion gravity scenario by assuming
a canonical scalar field non-minimally coupled to torsion with a Galileon-type self-interaction.
After obtaining the field equations for a flat FRW background, we derive the second order action
for both scalar and tensor perturbations to compute the power spectra of primordial fluctuations.
As particular models, we studied at first, a power-law form of coupling function $F(x)=1+\xi x^{2}/2$,
with $x\equiv \phi/M_{pl}$, and a monomial scalar field potential $V(x)=\lambda x^{n}/n$ which
is ruled out at $2\sigma$ level by current observational data for $n\geq 2$. Under slow-roll approximation
we obtain analytical expressions for the background as well as perturbative dynamics, and we show
that the predictions of the model are consistent with current Planck 2018 constraints on the spectral
index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ through the $n_s-r$ plane. Accordingly, this
model is in agreement with current observational bounds only within the $95\%$ C.L. region in the
case of chaotic quadratic inflation ($n=2$), whereas that for the other monomial potentials such
as $n=4/3$, $n=1$ and $n=2/3$, it is found that they are even more favoured, overlapping their results
with the $68\%$ C.L. region from last Planck data. Secondly, we studied a model in which the presence
of both non-minimal coupling to gravity and the Galileon non-linear self-interaction $\gamma
(\partial \phi)^2 \Box{\phi}$ leads to a suppression of the tensor-to-scalar ratio compared to
those predicted in the standard scenario, then predicting $0.024\lesssim r\lesssim 0.069$. This
result allows us to reconcile chaotic quadratic inflation with current Planck data up to the $68\%$
C.L. region.
