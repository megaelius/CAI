The large ${\cal N}=4$ nonlinear superconformal algebra is generated by six spin-$1$ currents,
four spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ currents and one spin-$2$ current. The simplest extension of these $11$
currents is described by the $16$ higher spin currents of spins $(1,\frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{2},
\frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 2,2,2,2,2,2, \frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2},\frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2},
3)$. In this paper, by using the defining operator product expansions (OPEs) between the $11$ currents
and $16$ higher spin currents, we determine the $16$ higher spin currents (the higher spin-$1, \frac{3}{2}$
currents were found previously) in terms of affine Kac-Moody spin-$\frac{1}{2}, 1$ currents in
the Wolf space coset model completely. An antisymmetric second rank tensor, three antisymmetric
almost complex structures or the structure constant are contracted with the multiple product of
spin-$\frac{1}{2}, 1$ currents. The Wolf space coset contains the group $SU(N+2)$ and the level
$k$ is characterized by the affine Kac-Moody spin-$1$ currents. After calculating the eigenvalues
of the zeromode of the higher spin-$3$ current acting on the higher representations up to three (or
four) boxes of Young tableaux in $SU(N+2)$ in the Wolf space coset, we obtain the corresponding three-point
functions with two scalar operators at finite $(N,k)$. Furthermore, under the large $(N,k)$ 't
Hooft like limit, the eigenvalues associated with any boxes of Young tableaux are obtained and the
corresponding three-point functions are written in terms of the 't Hooft coupling constant in simple
form in addition to the two-point functions of scalars and the number of boxes.
