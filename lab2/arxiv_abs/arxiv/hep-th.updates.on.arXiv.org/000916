In order to study the detailed dynamics and associated non-perturbative features of QCD, a dual
version of the color gauge theory based on the topologically viable homogeneous fiber bundle approach
has been analysed taking into account its magnetic symmetry structure. In the dynamically broken
phase of magnetic symmetry, the associated flux tube structure on a S 2 -sphere in the magnetically
condensed state of the dual QCD vacuum has been analyzed for the profiles of the color electric field
using flux quantization and stability conditions. The color electric field has its intimate association
with the vector mode of the magnetically condensed QCD vacuum and such field configurations have
been analyzed to show that the color electric flux gets localized towards the poles for a large sphere
case while it gets uniformly distributed for the small sphere case in the infrared sector of QCD.
The critical flux tube densities have been computed for various couplings and are shown to be in agreement
with that for lead-ion central collisions in the near infrared sector of QCD. The possible annihilation/unification
of flux tubes under some typical flux tube density and temperature conditions in the magnetic symmetry
broken phase of QCD has also been analyzed and shown to play an important role in the process of QGP
formation. The thermal variation of the profiles of the color electic field is further investigated
which indicates the survival of flux tubes even in the thermal domain that leads the possibility
of the formation of some exotic states like QGP in the intermedate regime during the quark-hadron
phase transition.
