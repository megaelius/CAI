To seek for a singularity free model universe from a perfect fluid scalar-metric cosmology, we work
in the "\emph{Emergent Cosmology}" (EC) paradigm which is a non-singular alternative for cosmological
inflation. By using two methods including Linear Stability Theory and Effective Potential Formalism,
we perform a classical analysis on the possible static solutions (that are called usually as Einstein
Static Universes (ESU)in literature) in order to study EC paradigm in a FRW background. Our model
contains a kinetic term of the scalar field minimally coupled to the background geometry without
a potential term. The matter content of the model consists of a perfect fluid plus a cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ as a separate source. In the framework of a local dynamical system analysis,
we show that in the absence or presence of $\Lambda$, depending on some adopted values for the free
parameters of the underlying cosmological model with flat and non-flat spatial geometries, one
gets some static solutions which are viable under classical linear perturbations. By extending
our study to a global dynamical system analysis, we show that in the presence of $\Lambda$ with non-flat
spatial geometries there is a future global de Sitter attractor in this model. Following the second
method, we derive a new static solution that represents a stable ESU but this time without dependence
on the free parameters of the cosmological model at hand. As a whole, our analysis suggests the possibility
of graceful realization of a non-singular EC paradigm (i.e. leaving the initial static phase and
entering the inflation period as the universe is evolving) through either preserving or violation
of the strong energy condition.
