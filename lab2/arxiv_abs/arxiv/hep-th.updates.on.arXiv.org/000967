We construct the Rarita-Schwinger basis vectors, $U^\mu$, spanning the direct product space,
$U^\mu:=A^\mu\otimes u_M$, of a massless four-vector, $ A^\mu $, with massless Majorana spinors,
$u_M$, together with the associated field-strength tensor, ${\mathcal T}^{\mu\nu}:=p^\mu U^\nu
-p^\nu U^\mu$. The ${\mathcal T}^{\mu\nu}$ space is reducible and contains one massless subspace
of a pure spin-$3/2$ $\in (3/2,0)\oplus (0,3/2)$. We show how to single out the latter in a unique
way by acting on ${\mathcal T}^{\mu\nu}$ with an earlier derived momentum independent projector,
${\mathcal P}^{(3/2,0)}$, properly constructed from one of the Casimir operators of the algebra
$so(1,3)$ of the homogeneous Lorentz group. In this way it becomes possible to describe the irreducible
massless $(3/2,0)\oplus (0,3/2)$ carrier space by means of the anti-symmetric-tensor of second
rank with Majorana spinor components, defined as $\left[ w^{(3/2,0) }\right]^{\mu\nu}:=\left[{\mathcal
P}^{(3/2,0)}\right]^{\mu \nu}\,\,_{\gamma\delta}{\mathcal T}^{\gamma \delta }$. The conclusion
is that the $(3/2,0)\oplus (0,3/2)$ bi-vector spinor field can play the same role with respect to
a $U^\mu$ gauge field as the bi-vector, $(1,0)\oplus (0,1)$, associated with the electromagnetic
field-strength tensor, $F_{\mu\nu}$, plays for the Maxwell gauge field, $A_\mu$. Correspondingly,
we find the free electromagnetic field equation, $p^\mu F_{\mu\nu}=0$, is paralleled by the free
massless Rarita-Schwinger field equation, $p^\mu \left[ w^{(3/2,0)}\right]_{\mu\nu}=0$,
supplemented by the additional condition, $\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu \left[ w^{(3/2,0)}\right]_{\mu
\nu} =0$, a constraint that invokes the Majorana sector.
