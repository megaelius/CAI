In understanding the quantum physics of a black hole, nonperturbative aspects of gravity play important
roles. In particular, huge gauge redundancies of a gravitational theory at the nonperturbative
level, which are much larger than the standard diffeomorphism and relate even spaces with different
topologies, allow us to take different descriptions of a system. While the physical conclusions
are the same in any description, the same physics may manifest itself in vastly different forms in
descriptions based on different gauge choices. In this paper, we explore the relation between two
such descriptions, which we refer to as the global gauge and unitary gauge constructions. The former
is based on the global spacetime of general relativity, in which understanding unitarity requires
the inclusion of subtle nonperturbative effects of gravity. The latter is based on a distant view
of the black hole, in which unitarity is manifest but the existence of interior spacetime is obscured.
These two descriptions are complementary. In this paper, we initiate the study of learning aspects
of one construction through the analysis of the other. We find that the existence of near empty interior
spacetime manifest in the global gauge construction is related to the maximally chaotic, fast scrambling,
and universal dynamics of the horizon in the unitary gauge construction. We use the complementarity
of the gauge choices to understand the ensemble nature of the gravitational path integral in global
spacetime in terms of coarse graining and thermality in a single unitary theory that does not involve
any ensemble nature at the fundamental level. We also discuss how the interior degrees of freedom
are related with those in the exterior in the two constructions. This relation emerges most naturally
as entanglement wedge reconstruction and the effective theory of the interior in the respective
constructions.
