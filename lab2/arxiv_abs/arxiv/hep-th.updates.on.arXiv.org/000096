Vasiliev's type A higher spin theories in AdS4 have been conjectured to be dual to the U(N) or O(N)
singlet sectors in 3-d conformal field theories with N-component scalar fields. We compare the
O(N^0) correction to the 3-sphere free energy F in the CFTs with corresponding calculations in the
higher spin theories. This requires evaluating a regularized sum over one loop vacuum energies
of an infinite set of massless higher spin gauge fields in Euclidean AdS4. For the Vasiliev theory
including fields of all integer spin and a scalar with Delta=1 boundary condition, we show that the
regularized sum vanishes. This is in perfect agreement with the vanishing of subleading corrections
to F in the U(N) singlet sector of the theory of N free complex scalar fields. For the minimal Vasiliev
theory including fields of only even spin, the regularized sum remarkably equals the value of F for
one free real scalar field. This result may agree with the O(N) singlet sector of the theory of N real
scalar fields, provided the coupling constant in the Vasiliev theory is identified as G_N ~ 1/(N-1).
Similarly, consideration of the USp(N) singlet sector for N complex scalar fields, which we conjecture
to be dual to the husp(2;0|4) Vasiliev theory, requires G_N ~ 1/(N+1). We also test the higher spin
AdS3/CFT2 conjectures by calculating the regularized sum over one loop vacuum energies of higher
spin fields in AdS3. We match the result with the O(N^0) term in the central charge of the W_N minimal
models; this requires a certain truncation of the CFT operator spectrum so that the bulk theory contains
two real scalar fields with the same boundary conditions.
