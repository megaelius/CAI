We constrain plausible dark energy models, parametrized by multiple candidate equation of state,
using the recently published Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy data from
Planck together with the WMAP-9 low-$\ell$ polarization data and data from low redshift surveys.
To circumvent the limitations of any particular equation of state towards describing all existing
dark energy models, we work with three different equation of state covering a broader class of dark
energy models and, hence, provide more robust and generic constraints on the dark energy properties.
We show that a clear tension exists between dark energy constraints from CMB and non-CMB observations
when one allows for dark energy models having both phantom and non-phantom behavior; while CMB is
more favorable to phantom models, the low redshift data prefers model with behavior close to a Cosmological
Constant. Further, we reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy as a function of redshift
using the results from combined CMB and non-CMB data and find that Cosmological Constant lies outside
the 1-$\sigma$ band for multiple dark energy models allowing phantom behavior. A considerable
fine tuning is needed to keep models with strict non-phantom history inside 2-$\sigma$ allowed
range. This result might motivate one to construct phantom models of dark energy, which is achievable
from String theory. However, disallowing phantom behavior, based only on strong theoretical prior,
leads to both CMB and non-CMB datasets agree on the nature of dark energy, with the mean equation of
state being very close to the Cosmological Constant.
