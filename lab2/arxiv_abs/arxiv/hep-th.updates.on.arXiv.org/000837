We examine the effects of dark energy dynamics and spatial curvature on cosmic reionization by studying
reionization in tilted spatially-flat and untilted non-flat XCDM and $\phi$CDM dynamical dark
energy inflation models that best fit the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy
and a large compilation of non-CMB data. We carry out a detailed statistical study, based on a principal
component analysis and a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of a compilation of lower-redshift reionization
data, to estimate the uncertainties in the cosmological model reionization histories. We find
that, irrespective of the nature of dark energy, there are significant differences between the
reionization histories of the spatially-flat and non-flat models. Although both the flat and non-flat
models can accurately match the low-redshift ($z\lesssim6$) reionization observations, there
is a clear discrepancy between high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter data and the predictions
from non-flat models. This is solely due to the fact that the non-flat models have a significantly
larger electron scattering optical depth, $\tau_{\rm el}$, compared to the flat models, which
requires an extended and much earlier reionization scenario supported by more high-redshift ionizing
sources in the non-flat models. Non-flat models also require strong redshift evolution in the photon
escape fraction, that can become unrealistically high ($\gtrsim1$) at some redshifts. However,
$\tau_{\rm el}$ is about 0.9-$\sigma$ lower in the tilted flat $\Lambda$CDM model when the new Planck
2018 data are used and this reduction will partially alleviate the tension between the non-flat
model predictions and the data.
