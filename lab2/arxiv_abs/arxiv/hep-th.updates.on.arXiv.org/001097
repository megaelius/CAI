Many models of the early universe predict that there should be primordial tensor perturbations.
These leave an imprint into the temperature and polarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). The differential equation describing the primordial tensor perturbations
is a second order differential equation and thus has two solutions. Canonically, the decaying solution
of this equation in radiation domination is dropped as it diverges at early times and on superhorizon
scales while it is then suppressed at late times. Furthermore, if there is an inflationary phase
prior to the radiation domination phase, the amplitude of the decaying mode will also be highly suppressed
as it enters the radiation phase, thus its effect will be negligible. In this study we remain agnostic
to the early universe models describing pre-radiation domination physics and allow this mode to
be present and see what effect it has on the CMB anisotropies. We find that the decaying mode, if normalised
at the same time on subhorizon scales as the growing mode leaves an imprint on the CMB anisotropies
that is identical to the growing mode. Contrary to expectation, on large scales both modes are poorly
constrained for a scale invariant spectrum, and the apparent divergence of the decaying mode does
not lead to a divergent physical observable. Quantitatively, the decaying mode can be more constrained
both from temperature and polarisation anisotropies. We use a model independent, non-parametric,
approach to constrain both of these primordial tensor perturbations using the temperature and
polarisation anisotropies. We find that both modes are best constrained at the reionisation and
recombination bumps and crucially, at the reionisation bump the decaying mode can be distinguished
from the growing mode.
