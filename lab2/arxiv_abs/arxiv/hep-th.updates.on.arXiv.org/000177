In light of the recent observational data coming from the sky we have two significant directions
in the field of theoretical cosmology recently. First, we are now able to make use of present observations,
such as the Planck and BICEP2 data, to examine theoretical predictions from the standard inflationary
$\Lambda$CDM which were made decades of years ago. Second, we can search for new cosmological signatures
as a way to explore physics beyond the standard cosmic paradigm. In particular, a subset of early
universe models admit a nonsingular bouncing solution that attempts to address the issue of the
big bang singularity. These models have achieved a series of considerable developments in recent
years, in particular in their perturbative frameworks, which made brand-new predictions of cosmological
signatures that could be visible in current and forthcoming observations. In this article we present
two representative paradigms of very early universe physics. The first is the so-called new matter
(or matter-ekpyrotic) bounce scenario in which the universe starts with a matter-dominated contraction
phase and transitions into an ekpyrotic phase. In the setting of this paradigm, we propose some possible
mechanisms of generating a red tilt for primordial curvature perturbations and confront its general
predictions with recent cosmological observations. The second is the matter-bounce inflation
scenario which can be viewed as an extension of inflationary cosmology with a matter contraction
before inflation. We present a class of possible model constructions and review its implications
on the current CMB experiments. Last, we review the significant achievements of these paradigms
beyond the inflationary $\Lambda$CDM model, which we expect to shed new light on the direction of
observational cosmology in the next decade years.
