In the Second Order Theories (SOT) of real relativistic fluids, the non-ideal properties of the
flows are described by a new set of dynamical tensor variables. In this work we explore the non-linear
dynamics of those variables in a conformal fluid. Among all possible SOTs, we choose to work with
the Divergence Type Theories (DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of thermodynamics
is fulfilled non-perturbatively. The tensor modes include two divergence-free modes which have
no analog in theories based on covariant generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equation, and that
are particularly relevant because they couple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the dynamics
of this irreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories such as DTTs, thermal fluctuations
induce a stochastic stirring force, which excites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum
conservation. From fluctuation-dissipation considerations it follows that the random force
is Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in turn excite vector modes, which
back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing a consistent non-linear, second order description
of the divergence-free tensor dynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism plus the
Two-Particle Irreducible Effective Action (2PIEA) formalism, we obtain the equations for the
relevant two-point correlation functions of the model: the retarded propagator and the Hadamard
function. The overall result of the self-consistent dynamics of the irreducible tensor modes at
this order is a depletion of the relaxation time for the hard modes, a fact that suggests that tensor
modes could sustain an inverse cascade of entropy.
