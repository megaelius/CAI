We have studied the preheating phase for a class of plateau inflationary model considering the four-legs
interaction term $(1/2)g^2\phi^2\chi^2$ between the inflaton $(\phi)$ and reheating field $(\chi)$.
We specifically focus on the detailed effect of a parameter $\phi_{\ast}$ that controls inflationary
dynamics and the shape of the inflaton potential. For $\phi_{\ast} < M_p$, the departure of the inflaton
potential from the usual power-law behavior $\phi^n$ significantly modifies the microscopic
behavior of the preheating dynamics. We analyze and compare in detail the efficiency of production,
thermalization and the final equation of state of the system for different models under consideration
with $n=2,4,6$ for two different values of $\phi_{\ast}$. Most importantly as we increase $n$,
or decrease $\phi_{\ast}$, the preheating occurs very efficiently with the final equation of state
to be that of the radiation, $w=1/3$. Specially for $n=2$, the final equation of state turned out
to be $w\simeq 0.2$. However, a complete decay of inflaton could not be achieved with the four-legs
interaction for any model under consideration. Therefore, in order to complete the reheating process,
we perform the perturbative analysis for the second stage of the reheating phase. Taking the end
product of the preheating phase as an initial condition we have solved the homogeneous Boltzmann
equations for both the fields supplemented by the constraints coming from the subsequent entropy
conservation. In so doing, we are able to calculate the reheating temperature which is otherwise
ill-defined right after the end of preheating. The temperature can be uniquely fixed for a given
inflaton decay constant and the CMB temperature. We also compare our results with the conventional
reheating constraint analysis and discuss the limit of inflaton decay constant from the field theory
perspective.
