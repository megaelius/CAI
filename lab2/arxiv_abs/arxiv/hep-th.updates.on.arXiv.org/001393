This paper reports certain ambiguities in the calculation of the ensemble average $\left<T_\mu{}_\nu\right>$
of the stress-energy-momentum tensor of an arbitrarily coupled massless scalar field in one-dimensional
boxes in flat spacetime. The study addresses a box with periodic boundary condition (a circle) and
boxes with reflecting edges (with Dirichlet's or Neumann's boundary conditions at the endpoints).
The expressions for $\left<T^\mu{}^\nu\right>$ are obtained from finite-temperature Green
functions. In an appendix, in order to control divergences typical of two dimensions, these Green
functions are calculated for related backgrounds with arbitrary number of dimensions and for scalar
fields of arbitrary mass, and specialized in the text to two dimensions and for massless fields.
The ambiguities arise due to the presence in $\left<T^\mu{}^\nu\right>$ of double series that
are not absolutely convergent. The order in which the two associated summations are evaluated matters,
leading to two different thermodynamics for each type of box. In the case of a circle, it is shown that
the ambiguity corresponds to the classic controversy in the literature whether or not zero mode
contributions should be taken into account in computations of partition functions. In the case
of boxes with reflecting edges, it results that one of the thermodynamics corresponds to a total
energy (obtained by integrating the non homogeneous energy density over space) that does not depend
on the curvature coupling parameter $\xi$ as expected; whereas the other thermodynamics curiously
corresponds to a total energy that does depend on $\xi$. Thermodynamic requirements (such as local
and global stability) and their restrictions to the values of $\xi$ are considered.
