The actual theoretical research investigates the resonant spontaneous bremsstrahlung (RSB)
of ultrarelativistic electrons under the condition of scattering on a nucleus in the field of a weak
electromagnetic wave. The progression of the functional mechanism indicates the transformation
of the intermediate virtual electron into the real particle state. As a result, the initial second
order process with accordance to the fine structure constant in the light field productively splits
into two consequent first order formations: the laser-stimulated Compton effect and the laser-assisted
scattering of an electron on a nucleus. It is important to emphasize that the resonance escalation
possesses a possibility to develop within two reaction channels. Therefore, the first channel
- delineates the occurrence that correlates to the spontaneous photon emission by an electron with
subsequent scattering on a nucleus. The second channel - illustrates the configuration corresponding
to the electron scattering on a nucleus with consecutive spontaneous photon emission in the wave
field. Moreover, the spontaneous photon radiation angle allocates a single-valued dependency
with the resonant frequency for the first channel in contrast to the second displacement that categorizes
a composite area with three various resonant frequency magnitudes for the particular emission
angle diapason. The project data analysis proposes that the reaction channels do not interfere
within the whole range of observation. To summarize, the investigation calculates that the particular
cross-section within the resonant ambience significantly exceeds the according cross-section
in the approximation of an external field absence. In conclusion, numerous scientific facilities
with specialization in pulsed laser radiation (SLAC, FAIR, XFEL, ELI, XCELS) may experimentally
validate the computational estimations.
