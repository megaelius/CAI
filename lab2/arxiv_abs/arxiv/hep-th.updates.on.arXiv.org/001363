We constructed a symplectic realization of the dynamic structure of two interacting spin-two fields
in three dimensions. A significant simplification refers to the treatment of constraints: instead
of performing a Hamiltonian analysis $\grave{a}\, la$ Dirac, we worked out a method that only uses
properties of the pre-symplectic two-form matrix and its corresponding zero-modes to investigate
the nature of constraints and the gauge structure of the theory. For instance, we demonstrate that
the contraction of the zero-modes with the potential gradient, yields explicit expressions for
the whole set of constraints on the dynamics of the theory, including the symmetrization condition
and an explicit relationship between the coupling and cosmological constants. This way, we further
identify the necessary conditions for the existence of a unique non-linear candidate for a partially
massless theory, using only the expression for the interaction parameters of the model. In the case
of gauge structure, the transformation laws for the entire set of dynamical variables are more straightforwardly
derived from the structure of the remaining zero-modes; in this sense, the zero-modes must be viewed
as the generators of the corresponding gauge transformations. Thereafter, we use an appropriate
gauge-fixing procedure, the time gauge, to compute both the quantization brackets and the functional
measure on the path integral associated with our model. Finally, we confirm that three-dimensional
bi-gravity has two physical degrees of freedom per space point. With the above, we provide a new perspective
for a better understanding of the dynamical structure of theories of interacting spin-two fields,
which does not require the constraints to be catalogued as first- and second-class ones as in the
case of Dirac's standard method.
