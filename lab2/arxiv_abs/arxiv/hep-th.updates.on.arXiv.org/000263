Continuum spectrum from black hole accretion disc holds enormous information regarding the strong
gravity regime around the black hole and hence about the nature of gravitational interaction in
extreme situations. Since in such strong gravity regime the dynamics of gravity should be modified
from the \EH one, its effect should be imprinted on the continuum spectrum originating from the black
hole accretion. To explore the effects of these alternative theories on the black hole continuum
spectrum in an explicit manner, we have discussed three alternative gravitational models having
their origin in three distinct paradigms --- (a) higher dimensions, (b) higher curvature gravity
and (c) Horndeski theories. All of them can have signatures sculptured on the black hole continuum
spectrum, distinct from the standard general relativistic scenario. Interestingly all these
models exhibit black hole solutions with tidal charge parameter which in these alternative gravity
scenarios can become negative, in sharp contrast with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Using
the observational data of optical luminosity for eighty Palomer Green quasars we have illustrated
that the difference between the theoretical estimates and the observational results gets minimized
for negative values of the tidal charge parameter. As a quantitative estimate of this result we concentrate
on several error estimators, including reduced $\chi^{2}$, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index
of agreement etc. Remarkably, all of them indicates a negative value of the tidal charge parameter,
signaling the possibility of higher dimensions as well as scalar charge at play in those high gravity
regimes.
