In this work we study the deformations into Lie bialgebras of the three relativistic Lie algebras:
de Sitter, Anti-de Sitter and Poincar\'e, which describe the symmetries of the three maximally
symmetric spacetimes. These algebras represent the centrepiece of the kinematics of special relativity
(and its analogue in (Anti-)de Sitter spacetime), and provide the simplest framework to build physical
models in which inertial observers are equivalent. Such a property can be expected to be preserved
by Quantum Gravity, a theory which should build a length/energy scale into the microscopic structure
of spacetime. Quantum groups, and their infinitesimal version `Lie bialgebras', allow to encode
such a scale into a noncommutativity of the algebra of functions over the group (and over spacetime,
when the group acts on a homogeneous space). In 2+1 dimensions we have evidence that the vacuum state
of Quantum Gravity is one such `noncommutative spacetime' whose symmetries are described by a Lie
bialgebra. It is then of great interest to study the possible Lie bialgebra deformations of the relativistic
Lie algebras. In this paper, we develop a classification of such deformations in 2, 3 and 4 spacetime
dimensions, based on physical requirements based on dimensional analysis, on various degrees
of `manifest isotropy' (which implies that certain symmetries, i.e. Lorentz transformations
or rotations, are `more classical'), and on discrete symmetries like P and T. On top of a series of
new results in 3 and 4 dimensions, we find a no-go theorem for the Lie bialgebras in 4 dimensions, which
singles out the well-known `$\kappa$-deformation' as the only one that depends on the first power
of the Planck length, or, alternatively, that possesses `manifest' spatial isotropy.
