In this Essay, we give a correct interpretation of a historical experiment by Kundig on the transverse
Doppler shift in a rotating system (Mossbauer rotor experiment). This experiment has been recently
first reanalyzed, and then replied by an experimental research group. The results of reanalyzing
the experiment have shown that a correct re-processing of Kundig's experimental data gives an interesting
deviation of a relative redshift between emission and absorption resonant lines from the standard
prediction based on the relativistic dilatation of time. Subsequent new experimental results
by the reply of Kundig experiment have shown a deviation from the standard prediction even higher.
By using the Equivalence Principle (EP), which states the equivalence between the gravitational
"force" and the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial frame of reference (included
a rotating frame of reference), here the theoretical framework of the Mossbauer rotor experiment
is reanalyzed directly in the rotating frame of reference through a general relativistic treatment.
It will be shown that previous analyses missed an important effect of clock synchronization. By
adding this new effect, the correct general relativistic prevision is in perfect agreement with
the new experimental results. Such an effect of clock synchronization has been missed in various
papers in the literature, with some subsequent claim of invalidity of the relativity theory and/or
some attempts to explain the experimental results through "exotic" effects. The general relativistic
interpretation in this Essay shows, instead, that the new experimental results of the Mossbauer
rotor experiment are a new, strong and independent, proof of general relativity.
