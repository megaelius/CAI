This thesis consists of four parts. In the first part of the thesis, we investigate the phase structure
of Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar system with a negative cosmological constant. We chart out the full
phase diagram, and discuss it's dependence on the value of the scalar charge. In the second part,
we do a systematic study of the phases of gravity coupled to an electromagnetic field and charged
scalar in flat space, with box boundary conditions, and we show that the system admits both boson
stars as well as hairy black holes as solutions, providing yet another way to evade flat space no-hair
theorems. In part three, we explicitly diagonalize the simplest non-trivial Gurau-Witten tensor
model and study its spectral and late-time properties. We find parallels to (a single sample of)
SYK where some of these features were recently attributed to random matrix behavior and quantum
chaos. In particular, after a running time average, the spectral form factor exhibits striking
qualitative similarities to SYK. In part four, we construct general asymptotically Klebanov-Strassler
solutions of a five dimensional $SU(2) \times SU(2) \times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_{2R}$
truncation of IIB supergravity on $ T^{1,1} $, that break supersymmetry. We observe that there are
only two SUSY-breaking modes even in this generalized set up, and by holographically computing
Ward identities, we confirm that only one of them corresponds to spontaneous breaking: this is the
mode triggered by smeared anti-D3 branes at the tip of the warped throat. Our results strengthen
the evidence that {\it if} the KKLT construction is meta-stable, it is indeed a spontaneously SUSY-broken
(and therefore bona fide) vacuum of string theory.
