We have investigated the effects of strong magnetic field on the properties of quarkonia immersed
in a thermal medium of quarks and gluons and studied its quasi-free dissociation due to the Landau-damping.
Thermalizing the Schwinger propagator in the lowest Landau levels for quarks and the Feynman propagator
for gluons in real-time formalism, we have calculated the resummed retarded and symmetric propagators,
which in turn give the real and imaginary components of dielectric permittivity, respectively.
The magnetic field affects the large-distance interaction more than the short-distance interaction,
as a result, the real part of potential becomes more attractive and the magnitude of imaginary part
too becomes larger, compared to the thermal medium in absence of strong magnetic field. As a consequence
the average size of $J/\psi$'s and $\psi^\prime$'s are increased but $\chi_c$'s get shrunk. Similarly
the magnetic field affects the binding of $J/\psi$'s and $\chi_c$'s discriminately, i.e. it decreases
the binding of $J/\psi$ and increases for $\chi_c$. However, the further increase in magnetic field
results in the decrease of binding energies. On contrary the magnetic field increases the width
of the resonances, unless the temperature is sufficiently high. We have finally studied how the
presence of magnetic field affects the dissolution of quarkonia in a thermal medium due to the Landau
damping, where the dissociation temperatures are found to increase compared to the thermal medium
in absence of magnetic field. However, further increase of magnetic field decreases the dissociation
temperatures. For example, $J/\psi$'s and $\chi_c$'s are dissociated at higher temperatures
at 2 $T_c$ and 1.1 $T_c$ at a magnetic field $eB \approx 6~{\rm{and}}~4~m_\pi^2$, respectively,
compared to the values 1.60 $T_c$ and 0.8 $T_c$ in the absence of magnetic field, respectively.
