When absorbing boundary conditions are used to evaporate a black hole in AdS/CFT, we show that there
is a phase transition in the location of the quantum Ryu-Takayanagi surface, at precisely the Page
time. The new RT surface lies slightly inside the event horizon, at an infalling time approximately
the scrambling time $\beta/2\pi \log S_{BH}$ into the past. We can immediately derive the Page curve,
using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, and the Hayden-Preskill decoding criterion, using entanglement
wedge reconstruction. Because part of the interior is now encoded in the early Hawking radiation,
the decreasing entanglement entropy of the black hole is exactly consistent with the semiclassical
bulk entanglement of the late-time Hawking modes, despite the absence of a firewall. By studying
the entanglement wedge of highly mixed states, we can understand the state dependence of the interior
reconstructions. A crucial role is played by the existence of tiny, non-perturbative errors in
entanglement wedge reconstruction. Directly after the Page time, interior operators can only
be reconstructed from the Hawking radiation if the initial state of the black hole is known. As the
black hole continues to evaporate, reconstructions become possible that simultaneously work
for a large class of initial states. Using similar techniques, we generalise Hayden-Preskill to
show how the amount of Hawking radiation required to reconstruct a large diary, thrown into the black
hole, depends on both the energy and the entropy of the diary. Finally we argue that, before the evaporation
begins, a single, state-independent interior reconstruction exists for any code space of microstates
with entropy strictly less than the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and show that this is sufficient
state dependence to avoid the AMPSS typical-state firewall paradox.
