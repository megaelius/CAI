We investigate the back reaction on the Schwarzschild black hole from the radiation field close
by but away from the equilibrium. The back reactions are characterized by the membrane close to the
black hole. When the membrane is thin, we show that the more massive the black hole is, the weaker its
back-reaction is. The larger temperature difference between the black hole and the radiation environment
gives rise to more significant back-reaction. We also found that larger temperature difference
can lead to more significant negative surface tension and back reaction as well as larger black hole
area. We calculate the effect of the back-reaction on the energy and entropy of the black hole. We
conclude that the back-reaction is more significant for some primordial black holes created in
the early universe. When the membrane is thick, the back reaction is found to be more significant
than that in the thin membrane case. Importantly, we quantified the nonequilibrium thermodynamic
dissipation represented by the entropy production rate for both the thin membrane and thick membrane
cases which increases significantly as the temperature difference increases. In general the nonequilibrium
effects characterized by the temperature difference can increase the energy and entropy loss as
well as the entropy production rate of the black hole and the membrane back reactions. And the nonequilibrium
entropy production rate appears to be significant compared to the entropy rate radiated by the black
hole as long as there is a finite temperature difference. This may shed light on the black hole information
paradox due to the information loss from entropy production rate in the nonequilibirum cases. We
also explore the nonequilibrium thermodynamic fluctuations of the black hole. The fluctuations
reflect the effects of the back-reactions of the Hawking radiation on the evolution of a black hole.
