The problem of Jeans gravitational instability is investigated for static and expanding universes
within the context of the five and thirteen field theories which account for viscous and thermal
effects. For the five-field theory a general dispersion relation has been derived with the help
of relevant linearized perturbation equations, showing that the shear viscosity parameter alters
the propagating modes for large and small wavelengths. The behavior of density and temperature
contrasts are analyzed for the hard-sphere model in detail. In the small wavelengths regime, increasing
the amount of shear viscosity into the system forces the harmonic perturbations to damp faster,
however, in the opposite limit larger values of shear viscosity lead to smaller values of density
and temperature contrasts. For the hyperbolic case, the dispersion relation becomes a polynomial
in the frequency with two orders higher in relation to the five-field theory, indicating that the
effects associated with the shear viscosity and heat flux are non-trivial. The profile of Jeans
mass in terms of the temperature and number density is explored by contrasting with several data
of molecular clouds. Regarding the dynamical evolution of the density, temperature, stress and
heat flux contrasts for a universe dominated by pressureless matter, we obtain also damped harmonic
waves for small wavelengths. In the case of large wavelengths, the density and temperature contrasts
grow with time (due to the Jeans mechanism) while the stress and heat flux contrasts heavily decay
with time. For an expanding universe, the Jeans mass and Jeans length are obtained and their physical
consequences are explored.
