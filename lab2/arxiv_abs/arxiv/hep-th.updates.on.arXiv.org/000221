On-shell Pauli-Villars regularization of the one-loop divergences of supergravity theories
is used to study the anomaly structure of supergravity and the cancellation of field theory anomalies
under a $U(1)$ gauge transformation and under the T-duality group of modular transformations in
effective supergravity theories with three K\"ahler moduli $T^i$ obtained from orbifold compactification
of the weakly coupled heterotic string. This procedure requires constraints on the chiral matter
representations of the gauge group that are consistent with known results from orbifold compactifications.
Pauli-Villars regulator fields allow for the cancellation of all quadratic and logarithmic divergences,
as well as most linear divergences. If all linear divergences were canceled, the theory would be
anomaly free, with noninvariance of the action arising only from Pauli-Villars masses. However
there are linear divergences associated with nonrenormalizable gravitino/gaugino interactions
that cannot be canceled by PV fields. The resulting chiral anomaly forms a supermultiplet with the
corresponding conformal anomaly, provided the ultraviolet cut-off has the appropriate field
dependence, in which case total derivative terms, such as Gauss-Bonnet, do not drop out from the
effective action. The anomalies can be partially canceled by the four-dimensional version of the
Green-Schwarz mechanism, but additional counterterms, and/or a more elaborate set of Pauli-Villars
fields and couplings, are needed to cancel the full anomaly, including D-term contributions to
the conformal anomaly that are nonlinear in the parameters of the anomalous transformations.
