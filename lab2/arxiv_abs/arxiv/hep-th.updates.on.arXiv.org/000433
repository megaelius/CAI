The classification of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs boils down to the classification of conical special
geometries with closed Reeb orbits (CSG). Under mild assumptions, one shows that the underlying
complex space of a CSG is (birational to) an affine cone over a simply-connected $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial
log-Fano variety with Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}=\delta_{p,q}$. With some plausible restrictions,
this means that the Coulomb branch chiral ring $\mathscr{R}$ is a graded polynomial ring generated
by global holomorphic functions $u_i$ of dimension $\Delta_i$. The coarse-grained classification
of the CSG consists in listing the (finitely many) dimension $k$-tuples $\{\Delta_1,\Delta_2,\cdots,\Delta_k\}$
which are realized as Coulomb branch dimensions of some rank-$k$ CSG: this is the problem we address
in this paper. Our sheaf-theoretical analysis leads to an Universal Dimension Formula for the possible
$\{\Delta_1,\cdots,\Delta_k\}$'s. For Lagrangian SCFTs the Universal Formula reduces to the
fundamental theorem of Springer Theory. The number $\boldsymbol{N}(k)$ of dimensions allowed
in rank $k$ is given by a certain sum of the Erd\"os-Bateman Number-Theoretic function (sequence
A070243 in OEIS) so that for large $k$ $$ \boldsymbol{N}(k)=\frac{2\,\zeta(2)\,\zeta(3)}{\zeta(6)}\,k^2+o(k^2).
$$ In the special case $k=2$ our dimension formula reproduces a recent result by Argyres et al. Class
Field Theory implies a subtlety: certain dimension $k$-tuples $\{\Delta_1,\cdots,\Delta_k\}$
are consistent only if supplemented by additional selection rules on the electro-magnetic charges,
that is, for a SCFT with these Coulomb dimensions not all charges/fluxes consistent with Dirac quantization
are permitted. We illustrate the various aspects with several examples and perform a number of explicit
checks. We include tables of dimensions for the first few $k$'s.
