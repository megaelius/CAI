The purpose of my PhD thesis is to investigate different group theoretical and geometrical aspects
of supergravity theories. To this aim, several research topics are explored: On one side, the construction
of supergravity models in diverse space-time dimensions, including the study of boundary contributions,
and the disclosure of the hidden gauge structure of these theories; on the other side, the analysis
of the algebraic links among different superalgebras related to supergravity theories. In the
first three chapters, we give a general introduction and furnish the theoretical background necessary
for a clearer understanding of the thesis. We then move to the original results of my PhD research
activity: We start from the development of the so called $AdS$-Lorentz supergravity in $D=4$ by
adopting the so called rheonomic approach and discuss on boundary contributions to the theory.
Subsequently, we focus on the analysis of the hidden gauge structure of supersymmetric Free Differential
Algebras. More precisely, we concentrate on the hidden superalgebras underlying $D=11$ and $D=7$
supergravities, exploring the symmetries hidden in the theories and the physical role of the nilpotent
fermionic generators naturally appearing in the aforementioned superalgebras. After that, we
move to the pure algebraic and group theoretical description of (super)algebras, focusing on new
analytic formulations of the so called $S$-expansion method. The final chapter contains the summary
of the results of my doctoral studies presented in the thesis and possible future developments.
In the Appendices, we collect notation, useful formulas, and detailed calculations.
