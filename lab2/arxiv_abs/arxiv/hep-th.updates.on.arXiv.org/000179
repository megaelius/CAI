We elaborate on the simple alternative from arXiv:1308.5759 to the matrix-factorization construction
of Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) polynomials for arbitrary knots and links in the fundamental representation
of arbitrary SL(N). Construction consists of 2 steps: first, with every link diagram with m vertices
one associates an m-dimensional hypercube with certain q-graded vector spaces, associated to
its 2^m vertices. A generating function for q-dimensions of these spaces is what we suggest to call
the primary T-deformation of HOMFLY polynomial -- because, as we demonstrate, it can be explicitly
reduced to calculations of ordinary HOMFLY polynomials, i.e. to manipulations with quantum R-matrices.
The second step is a certain minimization of residues of this new polynomial with respect to T+1.
Minimization is ambiguous and is actually specified by the choice of commuting cut-and-join morphisms,
acting along the edges of the hypercube -- this promotes it to Abelian quiver, and KR polynomial is
a Poincare polynomial of associated complex, just in the original Khovanov's construction at N=2.
This second step is still somewhat sophisticated -- though incomparably simpler than its conventional
matrix-factorization counterpart. In this paper we concentrate on the first step, and provide
just a mnemonic treatment of the second step. Still, this is enough to demonstrate that all the currently
known examples of KR polynomials in the fundamental representation can be easily reproduced in
this new approach. As additional bonus we get a simple description of the DGR relation between KR
polynomials and superpolynomials and demonstrate that the difference between reduced and unreduced
cases, which looks essential at KR level, practically disappears after transition to superpolynomials.
However, a careful derivation of all these results from cohomologies of cut-and-join morphisms
remains for further studies.
