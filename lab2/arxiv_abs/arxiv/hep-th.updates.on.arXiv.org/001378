Positive geometries encode the physics of scattering amplitudes in flat space-time and the wavefunction
of the universe in cosmology for a large class of models. Their unique canonical forms, providing
such quantum mechanical observables, are characterised by having only logarithmic singularities
along all the boundaries of the positive geometry. However, physical observables have logarithmic
singularities just for a subset of theories. Thus, it becomes crucial to understand whether a similar
paradigm can underlie their structure in more general cases. In this paper we start a systematic
investigation of a geometric-combinatorial characterisation of differential forms with non-logarithmic
singularities, focusing on projective polytopes and related meromorphic forms with multiple
poles. We introduce the notions of covariant forms and covariant pairings. Covariant forms have
poles only along the boundaries of the given polytope; moreover, their leading Laurent coefficients
along any of the boundaries are still covariant forms on the specific boundary. Whereas meromorphic
forms in covariant pairing with a polytope are associated to a specific (signed) triangulation,
in which poles on spurious boundaries do not cancel completely, but their order is lowered. These
meromorphic forms can be fully characterised if the polytope they are associated to is viewed as
the restriction of a higher dimensional one onto a hyperplane. The canonical form of the latter can
be mapped into a covariant form or a form in covariant pairing via a covariant restriction. We show
how the geometry of the higher dimensional polytope determines the structure of these differential
forms. Finally, we discuss how these notions are related to Jeffrey-Kirwan residues and cosmological
polytopes.
