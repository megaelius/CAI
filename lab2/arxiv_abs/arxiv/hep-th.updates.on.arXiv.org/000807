The formation of cosmic structures is an important diagnostic for both the dynamics of the cosmological
model and the underlying theory of gravity. At the linear level of these structures, certain degeneracies
remain between different cosmological models and alternative gravity theories. It is thus indispensable
to study the non-linear, late-time evolution of cosmic structures to try and disentangle their
fundamental properties caused by the cosmological model or gravity theory itself. Conventionally,
non-linear cosmic structure formation is studied by means of computationally expensive numerical
simulations. Since these inevitably suffer from shot noise and are too time consuming to systematically
scrutinize large parameter spaces of cosmological models or fundamental theories, analytical
methods are needed to overcome the limitations of numerical simulations. Recently, a new analytic
approach to non-linear cosmic structure formation has been proposed based on kinetic field theory
for classical particle ensembles. Within this theory, a closed, analytic, non-perturbative and
parameter-free equation could be derived for the non-linear power spectrum of cosmic density perturbations
which agrees very well with numerically simulated results to wave numbers $k\lesssim10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
at redshift $z = 0$. In this Letter, we study for the first time the implications of alternative gravity
theories for non-linear cosmic structure formation applying this promising new analytic framework.
As an illustrative example, we consider vector-tensor theories, which support very interesting
isotropic cosmological solutions.
