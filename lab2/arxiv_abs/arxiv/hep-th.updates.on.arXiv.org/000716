One of the primary targets of current and future cosmological observations are light thermal relics
of the hot big bang. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, an important thermal relic are
cosmic neutrinos, while interesting extensions predict new light particles which are even more
weakly coupled to ordinary matter. These elusive particles may nonetheless be produced efficiently
in the early universe and their gravitational influence could be detectable in cosmological observables.
In this thesis, we describe how measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale
structure (LSS) of the universe can shed new light on the properties of neutrinos and on the possible
existence of other light relics. These observations are remarkably sensitive to the amount of radiation
in the early universe, partly because free-streaming species such as neutrinos imprint a small
phase shift in the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) which we study in detail. Building on this
analytic understanding, we provide further evidence for the cosmic neutrino background by independently
confirming its free-streaming nature in CMB and LSS datasets. In particular, we establish a new
analysis of the BAO spectrum resulting in the first measurement of this imprint of neutrinos in the
clustering of galaxies. Future cosmological surveys, such as the next generation of CMB experiments
(CMB-S4), have the potential to measure the energy density of relativistic species at the sub-percent
level and will therefore be capable of probing physics beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate
how this can be achieved and present an observational target which would allow the detection of any
light particle that has ever been in thermal equilibrium. Interestingly, even the absence of a detection
would result in new insights by providing constraints on the couplings to the Standard Model. [Abridged]
