We consider a cosmological model in which the two major fluid components of the Universe, dark energy
and dark matter, flow with distinct four-velocities. This cosmological configuration is equivalent
to a single anisotropic fluid, expanding with a four-velocity that is an appropriate combination
of the two fluid four-velocities. The energy density of the single cosmological fluid is larger
than the sum of the energy densities of the two perfect fluids, i.e., dark energy and dark matter,
respectively, and contains a correction term due to the anisotropy generated by the differences
in the four-velocities. Furthermore, the gravitational field equations of the two-fluid anisotropic
cosmological model are obtained for a Bianchi type I geometry. By assuming that the non-comoving
motion of the dark energy and dark matter induces small perturbations in the homogeneous and isotropic
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker type cosmological background, and that the anisotropy
parameter is small, the equations of the cosmological perturbations due to the non-comoving nature
of the two major components are obtained. The time evolution of the metric perturbations is explicitly
obtained for the cases of the exponential and power law background cosmological expansion. Therefore,
if there is a slight difference between the four-velocities of the dark energy and dark matter, the
Universe would acquire some anisotropic characteristics, and its geometry will deviate from the
standard FLRW one. In fact, the recent Planck results show that the presence of an intrinsic large
scale anisotropy in the Universe cannot be excluded {\it a priori}, so that the model presented in
this work can be considered as a plausible and viable working hypothesis.
