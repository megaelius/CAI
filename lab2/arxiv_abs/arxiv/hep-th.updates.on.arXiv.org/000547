An alternative approach toward thermodynamic phase space of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes was
proposed in \cite{Dehy}, where the equation of state is written as $Q^{2}=Q^{2}(T,\Psi)$ with
$Q$ is the charge of the black hole and $\Psi=1/v$ (conjugate of $Q^{2} $) is the inverse of the specific
volume. It was shown that this new viewpoint can lead to phase transition and Van der Waals like behaviour
for the black holes with fixed cosmological constant. In this paper, we explore the possibility
of applying this approach for other system, by investigating the critical behavior of an $(n+1)$-dimensional
lifshitz dilaton black hole in the presence of power-law Maxwell field. We disclose that in order
to have critical behaviour, we should write down the equation of state as $Q^s=Q^s(T,\Psi)$ and
construct Smarr relation based on this new phase space as $ M=M(S,Q^{s},P)$, where $s=2p/(2p-1)$
with $p$ is the power of the Maxwell Lagrangian. We justify such a choice mathematically and show
that with this new phase space, the system allows the critical behaviour and resembles the Van der
Waals fluid system when the cosmological constant (pressure) is treated as a fixed parameter. We
obtain Gibbs free energy of the system and find swallow tail shape in Gibbs diagrams which represents
the first order phase transition. Finally, we calculate the critical exponents and show that although
thermodynamic quantities depend on the metric parameters such as $z$ , $p$ and $n$, the critical
exponents are the same as Van der Walls fluid system. This alternative viewpoint toward phase space
of lifshitz dilaton black hole can be understood easily since one can imagine such a change for a given
single black hole i. e. acquiring charge which induces the phase transition. Our results further
support the viewpoint suggested in [Dehy].
