Macdonald superpolynomials provide a remarkably rich generalization of the usual Macdonald polynomials.
The starting point of this work is the observation of a previously unnoticed stability property
of the Macdonald superpolynomials when the fermionic sector m is sufficiently large: their decomposition
in the monomial basis is then independent of m. These stable superpolynomials are readily mapped
into bisymmetric polynomials, an operation that spoils the ring structure but drastically simplifies
the associated vector space. Our main result is a factorization of the (stable) bisymmetric Macdonald
polynomials, called double Macdonald polynomials and indexed by pairs of partitions, into a product
of Macdonald polynomials (albeit subject to non-trivial plethystic transformations). As an off-shoot,
we note that, after multiplication by a t-Vandermonde determinant, this provides explicit formulas
for a large class of Macdonald polynomials with prescribed symmetry. The factorization of the double
Macdonald polynomials leads immediately to the generalization of basically every elementary
properties of the Macdonald polynomials to the double case (norm, kernel, duality, positivity,
etc). When lifted back to superspace, this validates various previously formulated conjectures
in the stable regime. The q,t-Kostka coefficients associated to the double Macdonald polynomials
are shown to be q,t-analogs of the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the hyperoctahedral
group B_n. Moreover, a Nabla operator on the double Macdonald polynomials is defined and its action
on a certain bisymmetric Schur function can be interpreted as the Frobenius series of a bigraded
module of dimension (2n+1)^n, a formula again characteristic of the Coxeter group of type B_n. Finally,
as a side result, we obtain a simple identity involving products of four Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients.
