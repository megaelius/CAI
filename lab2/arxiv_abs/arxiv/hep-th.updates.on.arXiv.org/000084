On-shell, analytic S-matrix elements are constructed from a finite set of primitive three-point
amplitudes, which are uniquely fixed by Poincare invariance. We classify all such three-point
amplitudes in four-dimensions. Imposing the simplest incarnation of Locality and Unitarity on
four-particle amplitudes constructed from these exact three-particle amplitudes rules-out
all but an extremely small subset of interactions among higher-spin massless states. Notably,
the equivalence principle, and the Weinberg-Witten theorem, are simple corollaries of this principle.
Further, no massless states with helicity larger than two may consistently interact with massless
spin-2 gravitons. Yang-Mills, chromodynamics, electrodynamics, and phi-cubed -theory are the
only marginal and relevant interactions between massless states consistent with this incarnation
Locality and Unitarity. Simple analysis of amplitudes with leading-order interactions between
massless spin-3/2 states shows that these states interact gravitationally. Supersymmetry naturally
emerges as a consistency condition on four-particle amplitudes involving spin-3/2 states. Constraints
obtained by simple pole-counting directly imply that the maximal number of distinguishable spin-3/2
states must be N = 4 if there are leading-order, marginal, interactions between particles of spin
less than, or equal to, s = 1. Purely gravitational theories, however, may have as many as N = 8 distinguishable
spin-3/2 states. Including more species of spin-3/2 states beyond these bounds forces inclusion
of S-matrix elements which cannot be both local and unitary: such amplitudes have more poles than
the number of independent kinematic invariants at four points.
