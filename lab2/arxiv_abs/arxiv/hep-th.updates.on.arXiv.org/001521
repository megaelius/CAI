We consider a mechanism for producing a significant population of primordial black holes (PBHs)
and an observable stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) within string theory inspired
models of inflation. In this framework where inflaton is identified as a non-compact axion-like
field, sub-leading non-perturbative effects can superimpose steep cliffs connected by smooth
plateaus onto the underlying axion potential. In the presence of coupling to Abelian gauge fields,
the motion of axion on the cliff-like region(s) of its potential triggers a localized production
of one helicity state of gauge fields due to the temporary fast-roll of axion around such a feature.
In this setup, primordial fluctuations sourced by vector fields exhibit a localized peak in momentum
space corresponding to modes that exit the horizon when the axion velocity is maximal. As an application
of this general mechanism, we present an example of axion inflation which both matches Planck observations
at CMB scales and generates a population of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \simeq 10^{-13} M_{\odot}$)
that can account for all dark matter. In this scenario, the enhanced scalar fluctuations that leads
to PBHs also generate an observable SGWB of induced origin at LISA scales. The amplitude and shape
of the resulting GW signal inherits specific properties (such as non-Gaussianity and its shape)
of its scalar sources that may allow us to distinguish this mechanism from other inflationary scenarios
and astrophysical backgrounds. This GW signal together with an observation of PBH distribution
at the corresponding scales can thus provide a window to the inflationary dynamics on scales much
smaller than those probed by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS)
Measurements.
