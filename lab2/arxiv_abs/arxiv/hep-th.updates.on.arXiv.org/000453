In recent years, tensor network states have emerged as a very useful conceptual and simulation framework
to study quantum many-body systems at low energies. In this paper, we describe a particular way in
which any given tensor network can be viewed as a representation of two different quantum many-body
states. The two quantum many-body states are said to correspond to each other by means of the tensor
network. We apply this "tensor network state correspondence"---a correspondence between quantum
many-body states mediated by tensor networks as we describe---to the multi-scale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA) representation of ground states of one dimensional (1D) quantum
many-body systems. Since the MERA is a 2D hyperbolic tensor network (the extra dimension is identified
as the length scale of the 1D system), the two quantum many-body states obtained from the MERA, via
tensor network state correspondence, are seen to live in the bulk and on the boundary of a discrete
hyperbolic geometry. The bulk state so obtained from a MERA exhibits interesting features, some
of which caricature known features of the holographic correspondence of String theory. We show
how (i) the bulk state admits a description in terms of "holographic screens", (ii) the conformal
field theory data associated with a critical ground state can be obtained from the corresponding
bulk state, in particular, how pointlike boundary operators are identified with extended bulk
operators. (iii) We also present numerical results to illustrate that bulk states, dual to ground
states of several critical spin chains, have exponentially decaying correlations, and that the
bulk correlation length generally decreases with increase in central charge for these spin chains.
