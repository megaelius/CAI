In a remarkable recent work [arXiv : 1711.09102] by Arkani-Hamed et al, the amplituhedron program
was extended to the realm of non-supersymmetric scattering amplitudes. In particular it was shown
that for tree-level planar diagrams in massless $\phi^{3}$ theory (and its close cousin, bi-adjoint
$\phi^{3}$ theory) a polytope known as the associahedron sits inside the kinematic space and is
the amplituhedron for the theory. Precisely as in the case of amplituhedron, it was shown that scattering
amplitude is nothing but residue of the canonical form associated to the associahedron. Combinatorial
and geometric properties of associahedron naturally encode properties like locality and unitarity
of (tree level) scattering amplitudes. In this paper we attempt to extend this program to planar
amplitudes in massless $\phi^{4}$ theory. We show that tree-level planar amplitudes in this theory
can be obtained from geometry of objects known as the Stokes polytope which sits naturally inside
the kinematic space. As in the case of associahedron we show that residues of the canonical form on
these Stokes polytopes can be used to compute scattering amplitudes for quartic interactions.
However unlike associahedron, Stokes polytope of a given dimension is not unique and as we show,
one must sum over all of them to obtain the complete scattering amplitude. Not all Stokes polytopes
contribute equally and we argue that the corresponding weights depend on purely combinatorial
properties of the Stokes polytopes. As in the case of $\phi^{3}$ theory, we show how factorization
of Stokes polytope implies unitarity and locality of the amplitudes.
