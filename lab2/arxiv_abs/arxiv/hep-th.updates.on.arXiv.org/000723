We present a study of the correlation function of three stress-energy tensors in $d$ dimensions
using free field theory realizations, and compare them to the exact solutions of their conformal
Ward identities (CWI's) obtained by a general approach in momentum space. The identification of
the corresponding form factors is performed within a reconstruction method, based on the identification
of the transverse traceless components $(A_i)$ of the same correlator. The solutions of the primary
CWI' s are found by exploiting the universality of the Fuchsian indices of the conformal operators
and a re-arrangement of the corresponding inhomogenous hypergeometric systems. We confirm the
number of constants in the solution of the primary CWI's of previous analysis. In our comparison
with perturbation theory, we discuss scalar, fermion and spin 1 exchanges at 1-loop in dimensional
regularization. Explicit checks in $d=3$ and $d=5$ prove the consistency of this correspondence.
By matching the 3 constants of the CFT solution with the 3 free field theory sectors available in d=4,
the general solutions of the conformal constraints is expressed just in terms of ordinary scalar
2- and 3-point functions $(B_0,C_0)$. We show how the renormalized $d=4$ TTT vertex separates naturally
into the sum of a traceless and an anomaly part, the latter determined by the anomaly functional and
generated by the renormalization of the correlator in dimensional regularization. The result
confirms the emergence of anomaly poles and effective massless exchanges as a specific signature
of conformal anomalies in momentum space, directly connected to the renormalization of the corresponding
gravitational vertices, generalizing the behaviour found for the $TJJ$ vertex in previous works.
