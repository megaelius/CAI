In this paper we find analytical expressions for thermodynamic quantities of scalar (tensor) and
vector unparticle static black holes. We also find rotating solutions to these systems and analyse
their thermodynamics. First we consider the static case with a spherically symmetric source for
both the vector and scalar (tensor) unparticles. We obtain thus analytical expressions to the principal
thermodynamic quantities: Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity and free energy. For the
scalar (tensor) case we find that the black hole presents a residual value for the entropy when its
radius goes to zero but the other thermodynamic quantities give, for any horizon radius, a thermodynamically
unstable behavior similar to the standard black hole. For the vector case we find a richer structure
in the region in which the horizon radius is less than the characteristic length of the unparticle
theory. We identify a phase transition and a region where the black hole can be thermodynamically
stable. Following, we show that the mentioned modifications in the standard gravity are formally
similar to those ones present in the black holes with quintessence. With this we also show, notwithstanding,
that the unparticles cannot be a source of quintessence. By using this similarity we find two different
rotating solutions to the unparticle black holes based on works by Ghosh and Toshmatov {\it et al}.
For both cases we compute the Hawking temperature and in the ungravity dominated regime we find,
as in the static cases, a fractalization of the event horizon. For the Gosh-like solution the fractal
dimension depends on the polar angle and on the rotation of the source. For the Toshmatov-like one
it is equal to the static case and therefore the fractalization is not dependent on the rotation of
the source.
