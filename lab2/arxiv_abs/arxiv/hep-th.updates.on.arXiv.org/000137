In this work the correspondence between the semiclassical limit of the DOZZ quantum Liouville theory
on the torus and the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the N=2* (Omega-deformed) U(2) super-Yang-Mills
theory is used to propose new formulae for the accessory parameter of the Lame equation. This quantity
is in particular crucial for solving the problem of uniformization of the one-punctured torus.
The computation of the accessory parameters for torus and sphere is an open longstanding problem
which can however be solved if one succeeds to derive an expression for the so-called classical Liouville
action. The method of calculation of the latter has been proposed some time ago by Zamolodchikov
brothers. Studying the semiclassical limit of the four-point function of the quantum Liouville
theory on the sphere they have derived the classical action for the Riemann sphere with four punctures.
In the present work Zamolodchikovs idea is exploited in the case of the Liouville field theory on
the torus. It is found that the Lame accessory parameter is determined by the classical Liouville
action on the one-punctured torus or more concretely by the torus classical block evaluated on the
saddle point intermediate classical weight. Secondly, as an implication of the aforementioned
correspondence it is obtained that the torus accessory parameter is related to the sum of all rescaled
column lengths of the so-called "critical" Young diagrams extremizing the instanton "free energy"
for the N=2* gauge theory. Finally, it is pointed out that thanks to the known relation the sum over
the "critical" column lengths can be expressed in terms of a contour integral in which the integrand
is built out of certain special functions.
