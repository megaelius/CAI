We use dynamical system methods to explore the general behaviour of $f(T)$ cosmology. In contrast
to the standard applications of dynamical analysis, we present a way to transform the equations
into a one-dimensional autonomous system, taking advantage of the crucial property that the torsion
scalar in flat FRW geometry is just a function of the Hubble function, thus the field equations include
only up to first derivatives of it, and therefore in a general $f(T)$ cosmological scenario every
quantity is expressed only in terms of the Hubble function. The great advantage is that for one-dimensional
systems it is easy to construct the phase space portraits, and thus extract information and explore
in detail the features and possible behaviours of $f(T)$ cosmology. We utilize the phase space portraits
and we show that $f(T)$ cosmology can describe the universe evolution in agreement with observations,
namely starting from a Big Bang singularity, evolving into the subsequent thermal history and the
matter domination, entering into a late-time accelerated expansion, and resulting to the de Sitter
phase in the far future. Nevertheless, $f(T)$ cosmology can present a rich class of more exotic behaviours,
such as the cosmological bounce and turnaround, the phantom-divide crossing, the Big Brake and
the Big Crunch, and it may exhibit various singularities, including the non-harmful ones of type
II and type IV. We study the phase space of three specific viable $f(T)$ models offering a complete
picture. Moreover, we present a new model of $f(T)$ gravity that can lead to a universe in agreement
with observations, free of perturbative instabilities, and applying the Om(z) diagnostic test
we confirm that it is in agreement with the combination of SNIa, BAO and CMB data at 1$\sigma$ confidence
level.
