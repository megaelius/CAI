In the AdS/CFT correspondence, it is often convenient to regulate infinite quantities in asymptotically
anti-de Sitter spacetimes by introducing a sharp cutoff in a radial coordinate. This procedure
is a priori coordinate-dependent, and may not be well-motivated in full, covariant general relativity;
however, the fact that physically meaningful quantities such as the entanglement entropy can be
obtained by such a regulation procedure suggests some underlying covariance. In this paper, we
provide a careful treatment of the radial cutoff procedure for computing holographic entanglement
entropy in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We prove two results that are frequently
assumed in the literature, but that have not been carefully addressed: (i) that the choice of a "globally
minimal surface" among several extremal candidates is independent of the choice of regulator,
and (ii) that finite CFT quantities such as the mutual information which involve "divergence-cancelling"
sums of holographic entanglement entropies are well-defined. Our results imply that the "globally
minimal surface" prescription for computing holographic entanglement entropy is well-posed
from the perspective of general relativity, and thus support the belief that this is the correct
prescription for identifying the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion in AdS/CFT. We also
comment on the geometric source of state-dependent divergences in the holographic entanglement
entropy, and identify precisely the regime of validity of the "vacuum subtraction" protocol for
regulating infinite entanglement entropies in arbitrary states by comparing them to the entanglement
entropies of identical regions in the vacuum. Our proofs make use of novel techniques for the covariant
analysis of extremal surfaces, which are explained in detail and may find use more broadly in the
study of holographic entanglement entropy.
