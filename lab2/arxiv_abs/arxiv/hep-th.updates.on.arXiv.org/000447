A quantum theory of the universe consists of a theory of its quantum dynamics and a theory of its quantum
state The theory predicts quantum multiverses in the form of decoherent sets of alternative histories
describing the evolution of the universe's spacetime geometry and matter content. These consequences
follow: (a) The universe generally exhibits different quantum multiverses at different levels
and kinds of coarse graining. (b) Quantum multiverses are not a choice or an assumption but are consequences
of the theory or not. (c) Quantum multiverses are generic for simple theories (d) Anthropic selection
is automatic because observers are physical systems within the universe not somehow outside it.
(e) Quantum multiverses can provide different mechanisms for the variation constants in effective
theories (like the cosmological constant) enabling anthropic selection. (f) Different levels
of coarse grained multiverses provide different routes to calculation as a consequence of decoherence.
We support these conclusions by analyzing the quantum multiverses of a variety of quantum cosmological
models aimed at the prediction of observable properties of our universe. In particular we show how
the example of a multiverse consisting of a vast classical spacetime containing many pocket universes
arises automatically as part of a quantum multiverse describing an eternally inflating false vacuum
that decays by the quantum nucleation of true vacuum bubbles. In a FAQ we argue that the quantum multiverses
of the universe are scientific, real, testable, falsifiable, and similar to those in other areas
of science even if they are not directly observable on arbitrarily large scales.
