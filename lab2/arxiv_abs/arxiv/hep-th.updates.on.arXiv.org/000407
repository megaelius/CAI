Three dimensional spin-3 gravity is thought to be holographically dual to W$_3$ extended CFT on
a boundary at infinity. It is known that while W$_3$ algebra is a non-linear algebra, in the limit
of large central charge $c$ a linear finite-dimensional subalgebra generated by $W_n \, (n=0,\pm1,\pm2)$
and $L_n (n= 0,\pm1)$ can be singled out. We consider an arbitrary holomorphic quasi-primary state
$|\Phi_h(x^+)\rangle=e^{ix^+L_{-1}} |\Phi_h(0)\rangle$ with conformal weight $h$ and deform
it by $W_{-1}$ as $|\Phi_h(x^+)\rangle \rightarrow |\tilde{\Phi}_h(x^+, \beta^+)\rangle =
e^{ix^+L_{-1}}e^{\beta^+W_{-1}} |\Phi_h(0) \rangle$. It is shown that as the parameter $\beta^+$
is increased from $0$ to $\infty$, the conformal weight of the state changes from $h$ to $h'=h/2$.
This is established by introducing coordinates of `internal space', $\alpha^+$, $\beta^+$, in
the direction of $W_{-2}$, $W_{-1}$, respectively, and computing two- and three-point functions
of W$_3$ quasi-primary operators moved to a `position $(x^+, \alpha^+,\beta^+)$'. Similar renormalization
group flow of currents in spin-3 gravity was reported by Ammon, Gutperle, Kraus and Perlmutter several
years ago. The flow we found in this paper, however, does not interchange rightmover and leftmover.
This flow is triggered by a deformation of the action by $W_{-1}$ and $\overline{W}_{-1}$. We also
construct a localized state in the bulk for a scalar field in W$_3$ gravity. The higher-dimensional
space, which combines the bulk spacetime and the `internal space', which is an analog of superspace
in supersymmetric theory, is introduced. Its metric tensor can be interpreted as describing a renormalization
group flow along $\beta^{\pm}$ directions between two AdS$_3$ vacua with distinct cosmological
constants.
