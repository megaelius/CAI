In General Relativity and many modified theories of gravity, isolated black holes (BHs) cannot
source massless scalar fields. Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMd) theory is an exception: through
couplings both to electromagnetism and (non-minimally) to gravity, a massless scalar field can
be generated by an electrically charged BH. In this work, we analytically model the dynamics of binaries
comprised of such scalar-charged ("hairy") BHs. While BHs are not expected to have substantial
electric charge within the Standard Model of particle physics, nearly-extremally charged BHs
could occur in models of minicharged dark matter and dark photons. We begin by studying the test-body
limit for a binary BH in EMd theory, and we argue that only very compact binaries of nearly-extremally
charged BHs can manifest non-perturbative phenomena similar to those found in certain scalar-tensor
theories. Then, we use the post-Newtonian approximation to study the dynamics of binary BHs with
arbitrary mass ratios. We derive the equations governing the conservative and dissipative sectors
of the dynamics at next-to-leading order, use our results to compute the Fourier-domain gravitational
waveform in the stationary-phase approximation, and compute the number of useful cycles measurable
by the Advanced LIGO detector. Finally, we construct two effective-one-body (EOB) Hamiltonians
for binary BHs in EMd theory: one that reproduces the exact test-body limit and another whose construction
more closely resembles similar models in General Relativity, and thus could be more easily integrated
into existing EOB waveform models used in the data analysis of gravitational-wave events by the
LIGO and Virgo collaborations.
