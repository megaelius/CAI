We investigate an entangled system, which is analogous to a composite system of a black hole and Hawking
radiation. If Hawking radiation is well approximated by an outgoing particle generated from a pair
creation around the black hole, such a pair creation increases the total number of states. There
should be a unitary mechanism to reduce the number of states inside the horizon for black hole evaporation.
Since the infalling antiparticle has negative energy, as long as the infalling antiparticle finds
its partner such that two particles form a separable state, one can trace out such a zero energy system
by maintaining unitarity. In this paper, based on some toy model calculations, we show that such
a unitary tracing-out process is only possible before the Page time, while it is impossible after
the Page time. Hence, after the Page time, if we assume that the process is unitary and the Hawking
pair forms a separable state, the internal number of states will monotonically increase, which
is supported by the AMPS argument. In addition, the Hawking particles cannot generate randomness
of the entire system and hence the entanglement entropy cannot reach its maximum. Based on these
results, we modify the correct form of the Page curve for the remnant picture. The most important
conclusion is this: if we assume unitarity, semi-classical quantum field theory, and general relativity,
then the black hole should violate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound around the Page time at
the latest, and hence, the infinite production arguments for remnants might be applied for semi-classical
black holes, which seems very problematic.
