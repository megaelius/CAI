In this sequel to works D(11.1) (arXiv:1406.0929 [math.DG]), D(11.2) (arXiv:1412.0771 [hep-th]),
and D(11.3.1) (arXiv:1508.02347 [math.DG]), we re-examine --- and reformulate when in need ---
several basic notions in super $C^{\infty}$-algebraic geometry as guided by the mathematical
formulation of Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz fermionic strings and of Green-Schwarz fermionic strings
from the viewpoint of Grothendieck on Algebraic Geometry. Two theorems that are the super counterpart
of Theorem~3.1.1 and Theorem~3.2.1 of D(11.3.1) are proved. They unify the notion of "smooth maps
from an Azumaya/matrix super smooth manifold with a fundamental module to a super smooth manifold"
introduced in D(11.2), making it a complete super parallel to the setting for D-branes in the realm
of algebraic geometry in D(1) (arXiv:0709.1515 [math.AG]) and D(2) (arXiv:0809.2121 [math.AG]),
and in the realm of differential or $C^{\infty}$-algebraic geometry in D(11.1) and D(11.3.1).
A prototypical definition of dynamical fermionic stacked D-brane world-volume on a space-time
in the same spirit of RNS fermionic strings or GS fermionic strings is thus laid down. Similar to D(11.3.1),
which paved the path to the construction of non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action (D(13.1) (arXiv:1606.08529
[hep-th])) and the standard action (D(13.3) (arXiv:1704.03237 [hep-th])) for fundamental bosonic
stacked D-branes, the current notes shall serve the same for the construction of supersymmetric
action for fundamental fermionic stacked D-branes of various dimensions --- a theme of another
subseries of the D-project. A notion of "noncommutative $C^{\infty}$-rings" and "morphism" between
them is introduced at the end as a byproduct.
