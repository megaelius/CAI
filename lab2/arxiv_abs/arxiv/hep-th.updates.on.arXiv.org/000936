There has been recent interest in the cosmological consequences of energy-momentum-powered gravity
models, in which the matter side of Einstein's equations is modified by the addition of a term proportional
to some power, $n$, of the energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the canonical linear term. In this
work we treat these models as phenomenological extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, containing
both matter and a cosmological constant. We also quantitatively constrain the additional model
parameters using low redshift background cosmology data that are specifically from Type Ia supernovas
and Hubble parameter measurements. We start by studying specific cases of these models with fixed
values of $n,$ which lead to an analytic expression for the Friedmann equation; we discuss both their
current constraints and how the models may be further constrained by future observations of Type
Ia supernovas for WFIRST complemented by measurements of the redshift drift by the ELT. We then consider
and constrain a more extended parameter space, allowing $n$ to be a free parameter and considering
scenarios with and without a cosmological constant. These models do not solve the cosmological
constant problem per se. Nonetheless these models can phenomenologically lead to a recent accelerating
universe without a cosmological constant at the cost of having a preferred matter density of around
$\Omega_M\sim0.4$ instead of the usual $\Omega_M\sim0.3$. Finally we also briefly constrain
scenarios without a cosmological constant, where the single component has a constant equation
of state which needs not be that of matter; we provide an illustrative comparison of this model with
a more standard dynamical dark energy model with a constant equation of state.
