We present new SO(4)-invariant and non-supersymmetric instanton solutions for the conformally
coupled m^2=-2 and massive m^2=+4 (pseudo)scalars arising from a consistent truncation of 11-dimensional
supergravity over AdS_4 x S^7/Z_k when the internal space is taken as a S^1 Hopf fibration on CP^3,
and we consider backreaction. In fact, the bulk configurations associate with (anti)membranes
wrapped around mixed internal (and external) directions, which in turn probe the Wick-rotated
or skew-whiffed background, break all supersymmetries as well as parity invariance. From near
the boundary behavior of the closed solution for the coupled bulk (pseudo)scalar, we get a marginal
triple-trace deformation with mixed boundary condition (valid also for the bulk massless m^2=0
(pseudo)scalar, raised when considering the external space backreaction, with Dirichlet boundary
condition) and as a result, the corresponding boundary effective potential is unbounded from below
and causes an instability because of the Fubini-like instanton. Indeed, presenting dual effective
actions, we see that the boundary solutions and counterparts realize in singlet sectors of three-dimensional
U(N) and O(N) Chern--Simons-matter field theories. In particular, we use versions of massless
and mass-deformed regular and critical boson and fermion models, find instantons and confirm state-operator
AdS_4/CFT_3 correspondence and also Bose-Fermi duality at the level of the solutions. In addition,
we discuss on relations of our setups with Vasiliev's Higher-Spin theories, deformations of the
Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena model and other related studies.
