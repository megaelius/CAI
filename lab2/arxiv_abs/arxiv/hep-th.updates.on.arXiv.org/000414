We analyze emergent quantum multi-criticality for strongly interacting, massless Dirac fermions
in two spatial dimensions ($d=2$) within the framework of Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models, by considering
the competing order parameters that give rise to fully gapped (insulating or superconducting)
ground states. We focus only on those competing orders, which can be rotated into each other by generators
of an exact or emergent chiral symmetry of massless Dirac fermions, and break $O(S_1)$ and $O(S_2)$
symmetries in the ordered phase. Performing a renormalization group analysis by using the $\epsilon=(3-d)$
expansion scheme, we show that all the coupling constants in the critical hyperplane flow toward
a new attractive fixed point, supporting an \emph{enlarged} $O(S_1+S_2)$ chiral symmetry. Such
a fixed point acts as an exotic quantum multi-critical point (MCP), governing the \emph{continuous}
semimetal-insulator as well as insulator-insulator (for example antiferromagnet to valence
bond solid) quantum phase transitions. In comparison with the lower symmetric semimetal-insulator
quantum critical points, possessing either $O(S_1)$ or $O(S_2)$ chiral symmetry, the MCP displays
enhanced correlation length exponents, and anomalous scaling dimensions for both fermionic and
bosonic fields. We discuss the scaling properties of the ratio of bosonic and fermionic masses,
and the increased dc resistivity at the MCP. By computing the scaling dimensions of different local
fermion bilinears in the particle-hole channel, we establish that most of the four fermion operators
or generalized density-density correlation functions display faster power law decays at the MCP
compared to the free fermion and lower symmetric itinerant quantum critical points. Possible generalization
of this scenario to higher dimensional Dirac fermions is also outlined.
