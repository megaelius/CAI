Here we investigate possible quantum analog of Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem in two types
of hybrid SYK models which contain both $ q=4 $ SYK with interaction $ J $ and $ q=2 $ SYK with an interaction
$ K $ in Type I or $ (q=2)^2 $ SYK with an interaction $ \sqrt{K} $ in Type II . These models include hybrid
Majorana fermion, complex fermion and bosonic SYK. We first introduce a new universal ratio which
is the ratio of the next nearest neighbour (NNN) energy level spacing to characterize the random
matrix behaviours. We make exact symmetry analysis on the possible symmetry class of both types
of hybrid SYK in the 10 fold way and also work out the degeneracy of each energy levels. We perform exact
diagonalization to evaluate both the known NN ratio and the new NNN ratio. In Type I, as $ K/J $ changes,
there is always a chaotic to non-chaotic transition (CNCT) from the GUE to Poisson in all the hybrid
fermionic SYK models, but not the hybrid bosonic SYK model. In Type II, there are always CNCT from
the corresponding GOE, GUE or GSE dictated by the symmetry of the $ q=4 $ SYK to the Poisson dictated
by $ ( q=2 )^2 $ SYK. When the double degeneracy at the $ q=4 $ ( or $ (q=2)^2 $ ) side is broken by the $ q=2
$ ( or $ q=4 $ ) perturbation in Type I ( or Type II), the new NNN ratio can be most effectively to quantify
the stability of quantum chaos ( or the KAM ). We compare the stability of quantum chaos and KAM theorem
near the integrability in all these hybrid SYK models. We also discuss some possible connections
between CNCT characterized by the random matrix theory and the quantum phase transitions (QPT)
characterized by renormalization groups. Quantum chaos in both types of hybrid SYK models are also
contrasted with that in the $ U(1)/Z_2 $ Dicke model in quantum optics.
