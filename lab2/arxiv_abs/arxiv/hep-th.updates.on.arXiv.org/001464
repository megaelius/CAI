It has been recently argued that the averaging of free CFT's over the Narain lattice can be holographically
described through a Chern-Simons theory for $U\left(1\right)^{D}\times U\left(1\right)^{D}$
with a precise prescription to sum over three-dimensional handlebodies. We show that a gravitational
dual of these averaged CFT's would be provided by Einstein gravity on AdS$_{3}$ with $U^{2\left(D-1\right)}$
gauge fields, endowed with a precise set of boundary conditions closely related to the "soft hairy"
ones. Gravitational excitations then go along diagonal $SL\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ generators,
so that the asymptotic symmetries are spanned by $U\left(1\right)^{D}\times U\left(1\right)^{D}$
currents. The stress-energy tensor can then be geometrically seen as composite of these currents
through a twisted Sugawara construction. Our boundary conditions are such that for the reduced
phase space, there is a one-to-one map between the configurations in the gravitational and the purely
abelian theories. The partition function in the bulk could then also be performed either from a non-abelian
Chern-Simons theory for two copies of $SL\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)\times U\left(1\right)^{D-1}$
generators, or formally through a path integral along the family of allowed configurations for
the metric. The new boundary conditions naturally accommodate BTZ black holes, whose number of
states is larger than those of the averaged theories at the boundary. Thus, in order to take into account
for the additional states, one should explore the possibility of extending the number of allowed
off-shell configurations in some suitable yet unknown way. The inclusion of higher spin currents
through an extended twisted Sugawara construction in the context of higher spin gravity is also
briefly addressed.
