The spectrum of integrable models is often encoded in terms of commuting functions of a spectral
parameter that satisfy functional relations. We propose to describe this commutative algebra
in a covariant way by means of the extended Q-system that comprise Q-vectors in each of the fundamental
representations of the (Langlands dual of) the underlying symmetry algebra. These Q-vectors turn
out to parameterise a collection of complete flags which are fused with one another in a particular
way. We show that the fused flag is gauge equivalent to a finite-difference oper, explicit equivalence
depends on (an arbitrary choice of) a Coxeter element. The paper considers the case of simple Lie
algebras with a simply-laced Dynkin diagram. For the $A_r$ series, the construction coincides
with already known results in the literature. We apply the proposed formalism to the case of the $D_r$
series and the exceptional algebras $E_r$, $r=6,7,8$. In particular, we solve Hirota bilinear
equations in terms of Q-functions and give the explicit character solution of the extended Q-system
in the $D_r$ case. We also show how to build up the extended Q-system of $D_r$ type starting either
from vectors, by a procedure similar to the $A_r$ scenario which however constructs a fused flag
of isotropic spaces, or from pure spinors, via fused Fierz relations. Finally, for the case of rational,
trigonometric, and elliptic spin chains, we propose an explicit ansatz for the analytic structure
of Q-functions of the extended Q-system. We conjecture that the extended Q-system constrained
in such a way is always in bijection with actual Bethe algebra of commuting transfer matrices of these
models and moreover can be used to show that the Bethe algebra has a simple joint spectrum.
