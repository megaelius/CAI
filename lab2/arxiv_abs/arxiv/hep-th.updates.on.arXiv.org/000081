The Planckon densely piled model of vacuum is proposed. Based on it, the microscopic quantum structure
of Schwarzschild black hole and quantum statistical origin of its gravity are studied. It is shown
that thermodynamic temperature equilibrium and mechanical acceleration balance make the space-time
of the black hole horizon singular and Casimir effect works inside the horizon. This effect makes
the inside vacuum have less zero fluctuation energy than the outside vacuum, and a temperature difference
as well as gravity as thermal pressure are created. A dual relation between inside and outside regions
of the black hole is found. By the dual relation, an attractor behaviour of the horizon surface is
unveiled. Outside horizon, there exist thermodynamic non-equilibrium and mechanical non-balance
which lead to outward centrifugal energy flow and inward gravitation energy flow, their compensation
establishes local equilibrium. The lost vacuum energy in negative gravitation potential regions
has been removed to the black hole surface to form a spherical Planckon shell with the thickness of
Planckon diameter. All the particles absorbed by the black hole have fallen down to the horizon and
converted into spin 1/2 radiation quanta made of standing waves on the horizon sphere with the mean
energy related to Hawking-Unruh temperature, thermodynamic equilibrium and mechanical balance
keep them stable and be tightly bound in the horizon. The gravitation mass 2M and physical mass $M$
of the black hole are calculated. The entropy of the black hole, calculated from the microscopic
state number of the many-body system of radiation fermion quanta, is well consistent with Hawking.
A radical modification of the temperature law of the black hole is made. The accelerating expansion
of the universe yields the expansion cosmon and its energy density agrees with dark energy density.
