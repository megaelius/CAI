In Ref. [arXiv:1802.05554v3] one of the authors (N.S.M.B.) studies the second quantization of
fermions with integer spin while describing the internal degrees of freedom of fermions in Grassmann
space. In this contribution we study the representations in Grassmann space of the groups $SO(5,1)$,
$SO(3,1)$, $SU(3) \times U(1)$, and $SO(4)$, which are of particular interest as the subgroups
of the group $SO(13,1)$. The second quantized integer spin fermions, appearing in Grassmann space,
not observed so far, could be an alternative choice to the half integer spin fermions, appearing
in Clifford space. The spin-charge-family theory, using two kinds of Clifford operators --- $\gamma^a$
and $\tilde{\gamma}^a$ --- for the description of spins and charges (first) and family quantum
numbers (second), offers the explanation for not only the appearance of families but also for all
the properties of quarks and leptons, the gauge fields, scalar fields and others. In both cases the
gauge fields in $d \ge(13+1)$ --- the spin connections $\omega_{ab \alpha}$ (of the two kinds in
Clifford case and of one kind in Grassmann case) and the vielbeins $f^{\alpha}{}_{\alpha}$ ---
determine in $d=(3+1)$ scalars, those with the space index $\alpha=(5,6,\cdots,d)$, and gauge
fields, those with the space index $\alpha=(0,1,2,3)$. While states of the Lorentz group and all
its subgroups (in any dimension) are in Clifford space in the fundamental representations of the
groups, with the family degrees of freedom included, states in Grassmann space manifest with respect
to the Lorentz group adjoint representations, allowing no families.
