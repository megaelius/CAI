In the conventional formalism of physics, with 1-time, systems with different Hamiltonians or
Lagrangians have different physical interpretations and are considered to be independent systems
unrelated to each other. However, in this paper we construct explicitly canonical maps in 1T phase
space (including timelike components, specifically the Hamiltonian) to show that it is appropriate
to regard various 1T-physics systems, with different Lagrangians or Hamiltonians, as being duals
of each other. This concept is similar in spirit to dualities discovered in more complicated examples
in field theory or string theory. Our approach makes it evident that such generalized dualities
are widespread. This suggests that, as a general phenomenon, there are hidden relations and hidden
symmetries that conventional 1T-physics does not capture, implying the existence of a more unified
formulation of physics that naturally supplies the hidden information. In fact, we show that 2T-physics
in (d+2)-dimensions is the generator of these dualities in 1T-physics in d-dimensions by providing
a holographic perspective that unifies all the dual 1T systems into one. The unifying ingredient
is a gauge symmetry in phase space. Via such dualities it is then possible to gain new insights toward
new physical predictions not suspected before, and suggest new methods of computation that yield
results not obtained before. As an illustration, we will provide concrete examples of 1T-systems
in classical mechanics that are solved analytically for the first time via our dualities. These
dualities in classical mechanics have counterparts in quantum mechanics and field theory, and
in some simpler cases they have already been constructed in field theory. We comment on the impact
of our approach on the meaning of spacetime and on the development of new computational methods based
on dualities.
