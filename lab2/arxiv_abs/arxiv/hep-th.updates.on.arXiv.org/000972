We study Euler scale hydrodynamics of massless integrable quantum field theories interpolating
between two non-trivial renormalisation group fixed points after inhomogeneous quantum quenches.
Using a partitioning protocol with left and right initial thermal states and the recently developed
framework of generalised hydrodynamics, we focus on current and density profiles for the energy
and momentum as a function of \xi=x/t, where both x and t are sent to infinity. Studying the first few
members of the A_{n} and D_{n} massless flows we carry out a systematic treatment of these series
and generalise our results to other unitary massless models. In our analysis we find that the profiles
exhibit extended plateaux and that non-trivial bounds exist for the energy and momentum densities
and currents in the non-equilibrium stationary state, i.e. when \xi=0. To quantify the magnitude
of currents and densities, dynamical central charges are defined and it is shown that the dynamical
central charge for the energy current satisfies a certain monotonicity property. We discuss the
connection of the Landauer-Buttiker formalism of transport with our results and show that this
picture can account for some of the bounds for the currents and for the monotonicity of the dynamical
central charge. These properties are shown to be present not only in massless flows but also in the
massive sinh-Gordon model suggesting their general validity and the correctness of the Landauer-Buttiker
interpretation of transport in integrable field theories. Finally we also study the interesting
low energy behaviour of the A_{2} model that corresponds to the massless flow from the tricritical
to the critical Ising field theory.
