The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from black hole (BH) mergers provides an inroad toward
probing the interior of astrophysical BHs. The general-relativistic description of the BH interior
is that of empty spacetime with a (possibly) singular core. Recently, however, the hypothesis that
the BH interior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for resolving the
BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for answering the following question:
Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does it contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty?
Our proposal is premised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact stars,
any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should support fluid modes in addition
to the conventional spacetime modes. In particular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose
spectrum is mostly insensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal
feature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of these modes are determined
by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The r-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay
at a slower rate and produce weaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class. Hence, they imprint a
model-insensitive signature of a non-empty interior in the GW spectrum resulting from a BH merger.
We find that future GW detectors, such as Advanced LIGO with its design sensitivity, have the potential
of detecting such r-modes if the amount of GWs leaking out quantum mechanically from the interior
of a BH-like object is sufficiently large.
