The higher fusion level logarithmic minimal models LM(P,P';n) have recently been constructed
as the diagonal GKO cosets (A_1^{(1)})_k oplus (A_1^{(1)})_n / (A_1^{(1)})_{k+n} where n>0
is an integer fusion level and k=nP/(P'-P)-2 is a fractional level. For n=1, these are the logarithmic
minimal models LM(P,P'). For n>1, we argue that these critical theories are realized on the lattice
by n x n fusion of the n=1 models. For n=2, we call them logarithmic superconformal minimal models
LSM(p,p') where P=|2p-p'|, P'=p' and p,p' are coprime, and they share the central charges of the
rational superconformal minimal models SM(P,P'). Their mathematical description entails the
fused planar Temperley-Lieb algebra which is a spin-1 BMW tangle algebra with loop fugacity beta_2=x^2+1+x^{-2}
and twist omega=x^4 where x=e^{i(p'-p)pi/p'}. Examples are superconformal dense polymers LSM(2,3)
with c=-5/2, beta_2=0 and superconformal percolation LSM(3,4) with c=0, beta_2=1. We calculate
the free energies analytically. By numerically studying finite-size spectra on the strip with
appropriate boundary conditions in Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors, we argue that, in the continuum
scaling limit, these lattice models are associated with the logarithmic superconformal models
LM(P,P';2). For system size N, we propose finitized Kac character formulas whose P,P' dependence
only enters in the fractional power of q in a prefactor. These characters involve Motzkin and Riordan
polynomials defined in terms of q-trinomial coefficients. Using the Hamiltonian limit, we argue
that there exist reducible yet indecomposable representations for which the Virasoro dilatation
operator L_0 exhibits rank-2 Jordan blocks confirming that these theories are indeed logarithmic.
We relate these results to the N=1 superconformal representation theory.
