It is well known that the low-energy classical dynamics of solitons of Bogomol'nyi type is well approximated
by geodesic motion in M_n, the moduli space of static n-solitons. There is an obvious quantization
of this dynamics wherein the wavefunction evolves according to the Hamiltonian H_0 equal to (half)
the Laplacian on M_n. Born-Oppenheimer reduction of analogous mechanical systems suggests, however,
that this simple Hamiltonian should receive corrections including k, the scalar curvature of M_n,
and C, the n-soliton Casimir energy, which are usually difficult to compute, and whose effect on
the energy spectrum is unknown. This paper analyzes the spectra of H_0 and two corrections to it suggested
by work of Moss and Shiiki, namely H_1=H_0+k/4 and H_2=H_1+C, in the simple but nontrivial case of
a single CP^1 lump moving on the two-sphere. Here M_1=TSO(3), a noncompact kaehler 6-manifold invariant
under an SO(3)xSO(3) action, whose geometry is well understood. The symmetry gives rise to two conserved
angular momenta, spin and isospin. A hidden isometry of M_1 is found which implies that all three
energy spectra are symmetric under spin-isospin interchange. The Casimir energy is found exactly
on the zero section of TSO(3), and approximated numerically on the rest of M_1. The lowest 19 eigenvalues
of H_i are found for i=0,1,2, and their spin-isospin and parity compared. The curvature corrections
in H_1 lead to a qualitatively unchanged low-level spectrum while the Casimir energy in H_2 leads
to significant changes. The scaling behaviour of the spectra under changes in the radii of the domain
and target spheres is analyzed, and it is found that the disparity between the spectra of H_1 and H_2
is reduced when the target sphere is made smaller.
