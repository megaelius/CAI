A century ago, Einstein formulated his elegant and elaborate theory of General Relativity, which
has so far withstood a multitude of empirical tests with remarkable success. Notwithstanding the
triumphs of Einstein's theory, the tenacious challenges of modern cosmology and of particle physics
have motivated the exploration of further generalised theories of spacetime. Even though Einstein's
interpretation of gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime is commonly adopted, the assignment
of geometrical concepts to gravity is ambiguous because General Relativity allows three entirely
different, but equivalent approaches of which Einstein's interpretation is only one. From a field-theoretical
perspective, however, the construction of a consistent theory for a Lorentz-invariant massless
spin-2 particle uniquely leads to General Relativity. Keeping Lorentz invariance then implies
that any modification of General Relativity will inevitably introduce additional propagating
degrees of freedom into the gravity sector. Adopting this perspective, we will review the recent
progress in constructing consistent field theories of gravity based on additional scalar, vector
and tensor fields. Within this conceptual framework, we will discuss theories with Galileons,
with Lagrange densities as constructed by Horndeski and beyond, extended to DHOST interactions,
or containing generalized Proca fields and extensions thereof, or several Proca fields, as well
as bigravity theories and scalar-vector-tensor theories. We will review the motivation of their
inception, different formulations, and essential results obtained within these classes of theories
together with their empirical viability.
