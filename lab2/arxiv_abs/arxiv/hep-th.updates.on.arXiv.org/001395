We explore conformally coupled scalar theory in AdS$_{6}$ extensively and their classical solutions
by employing power expansion order by order in its self-interaction coupling $\lambda$. We study
holographic correlation functions of scalar operator deformations to a certain 5-dimensional
conformal field theory where the operators share the same scaling dimension $\Delta=3$, from the
classical solutions. For our solutions, we choose a scheme where we remove co-linear divergences
of momenta along the AdS boundary directions which frequently appear in the classical solutions.
This shows clearly that the holographic correlation functions are free from the co-linear divergences.
It turns out that this theory provides correct conformal 2- and 3- point functions of the $\Delta=3$
scalar operators as expected in previous literature. It makes sense since 2- and 3- point functions
are determined by global conformal symmetry not being dependent on the details of the conformal
theory. We also get 4-point function from this holographic model. In fact, it turns out that the 4-point
correlation function is not conformal because it does not satisfy the special conformal Ward identity
although it does dilation Ward identity and respect $SO(5)$ rotation symmetry. However, in the
co-linear limit that all the external momenta are in a same direction, the 4-point function is conformal
which means that it satisfy the special conformal Ward identity. We inspect holographic $n$-point
functions of this theory which can be obtained by employing a certain Feynman-like rule. This rule
is a construction of $n$-point function by connecting $l$-point functions each other where $l<n$.
In the co-linear limit, these $n$-point functions reproduce the conformal $n$-point functions
of $\Delta=3$ scalar operators in $d=5$ Euclidean space addressed in arXiv:2001.05379.
