In this work, we study the general properties of the vector field localization on $(D-d-1)$-brane
with co-dimension $d$ in asymptotically AdS spacetime. We consider a conformally flat metric with
the warp factor depending only on the transverse extra dimensions. It is known that the free gauge
field cannot be confined in co-dimension one braneworlds. Also, in most of the higher co-dimension
models a general mechanism to solve this is lacking. For co-dimension one models, such problem can
be solved by using non-minimal couplings with gravity. Here we apply this mechanism stressing the
universal aspects that lead to localization of gauge field. We show with this that an analytical
solution to the $U(1)$ gauge field (zero-mode) on the brane can be always obtained, and also, a localization
condition can be found by setting up the bulk geometry as asymptotically AdS. Beyond that, the existence
of this massless mode has as a first consequence to exclude any possible tachionic modes of the theory.
Thus, our solution has an universal validity for any warp factor and is independent of the particular
model considered. Finally we obtain some conditions in which the localization of gravity ensure
localization of the gauge field. A drawback in the co-dimension one case is that scalar components
of the vector field are not localized simultaneously with the gauge field. As a general result, for
this case, we show that when more co-dimensions and the coupling with scalar and Ricci tensor are
considered, there is an indication that both sectors can be localized. As a concrete example, we
apply the above technichs for the intersecting brane model. We obtain that the branes introduces
new boundary conditions that fixes all the parameters of the model. Even so we get that both sectors,
gauge and scalar fields, can be confined.
