Gravity is commonly thought of as one of the four force fields in nature. However, in standard formulations
its mathematical structure is rather different from the Yang-Mills fields of particle physics
that govern the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. This paper explores this dissonance
with particular focus on how gravity couples to matter from the perspective of the Cartan-geometric
formulation of gravity. There the gravitational field is represented by a pair of variables: 1)
a `contact vector' $V^A$ which is geometrically visualized as the contact point between the spacetime
manifold and a model spacetime being `rolled' on top of it, and 2) a gauge connection $A_{\mu}^{\ph\mu
AB}$, taken to be valued in the Lie algebra of SO(2,3) or SO(1,4), which mathematically determines
how much the model spacetime is rotated when rolled. By insisting on two principles, the {\em gauge
principle} and {\em polynomial simplicity}, we show how one can reformulate the standard matter
field actions in a way that is harmonious with Cartan's geometric construction. This yields a formulation
of all matter fields in terms of first order partial differential equations. We show in detail how
the standard second order formulation can be recovered. Furthermore, the energy-momentum and
spin-density three-forms are naturally combined into a single object here denoted the spin-energy-momentum
three-form. Finally, we highlight a peculiarity in the mathematical structure of our first-order
formulation of Yang-Mills fields. This suggests a way to unify a U(1) gauge field with gravity into
a SO(1,5)-valued gauge field using a natural generalization of Cartan geometry in which the larger
symmetry group is spontaneously broken down to $SO(1,3)\times U(1)$. The coupling of this unified
theory to matter fields and possible extensions to non-Abelian gauge fields are left as open questions.
