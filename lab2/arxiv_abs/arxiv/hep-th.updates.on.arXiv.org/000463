We analyze four-dimensional quantum field theories with continuous 2-group global symmetries.
At the level of their charges such symmetries are identical to a product of continuous flavor or spacetime
symmetries with a 1-form global symmetry $U(1)^{(1)}_B$, which arises from a conserved 2-form
current $J_B^{(2)}$. Rather, 2-group symmetries are characterized by deformed current algebras,
with quantized structure constants, which allow two flavor currents or stress tensors to fuse into
$J_B^{(2)}$. This leads to unconventional Ward identities, which constrain the allowed patterns
of spontaneous 2-group symmetry breaking and other aspects of the renormalization group flow.
If $J_B^{(2)}$ is coupled to a 2-form background gauge field $B^{(2)}$, the 2-group current algebra
modifies the behavior of $B^{(2)}$ under background gauge transformations. Its transformation
rule takes the same form as in the Green-Schwarz mechanism, but only involves the background gauge
or gravity fields that couple to the other 2-group currents. This makes it possible to partially
cancel reducible 't Hooft anomalies using Green-Schwarz counterterms for the 2-group background
gauge fields. The parts that cannot be cancelled are reinterpreted as mixed, global anomalies involving
$U(1)_B^{(1)}$ and receive contributions from topological, as well as massless, degrees of freedom.
Theories with 2-group symmetry are constructed by gauging an abelian flavor symmetry with suitable
mixed 't Hooft anomalies, which leads to many simple and explicit examples. Some of them have dynamical
string excitations that carry $U(1)_B^{(1)}$ charge, and 2-group symmetry determines certain
't Hooft anomalies on the world sheets of these strings. Finally, we point out that holographic theories
with 2-group global symmetries have a bulk description in terms of dynamical gauge fields that participate
in a conventional Green-Schwarz mechanism.
