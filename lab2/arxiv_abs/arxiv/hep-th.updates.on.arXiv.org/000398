In classical general relativity, extended Rindler space is equivalent to flat Minkowski space;
it consists of the union of the four wedges in (u,v) light-cone coordinates as in Fig.1. In quantum
mechanics, the wavefunction of a particle propagating on such a background is an analytic function
of (u,v) that is sensitive to branch points at the horizons u=0 or v=0, with branch cuts attached to
them. The wavefunction is uniquely defined by analyticity on an infinite number of sheets in the
cut analytic (u,v) spacetime. This structure is naturally interpreted as an infinite stack of identical
Minkowski geometries, or "universes", connected to each other by analyticity across branch cuts,
such that each sheet represents a different Minkowski universe when (u,v) are analytically continued
to the real axis on any sheet. We show in this paper that information does not flow from one sheet to
another, so each Rindler sheet remains an independent universe, apparently unaware of the other
sheets, in the absence of interactions. By contrast, for an eternal black hole spacetime, which
may be viewed as a modification of Rindler that includes gravitational interactions, analyticity
of the wavefunction in (u,v) Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates is more involved because the singularity
creates an additional branch cut. The new cut opens up a communication channel between neighboring
sheets with information flowing through the singularity from sheet to sheet. The nature and origin
of the "multiverse" idea introduced in this paper are different from other notions of a multiverse.
This paper demonstrates the new multi-sheet aspects and the related information conservation
within each sheet of the extended Rindler space. The related cases of an eternal black hole spacetime
or cosmological spacetime that have additional branch cuts and information flow among sheets in
the multiverse are discussed in other papers.
