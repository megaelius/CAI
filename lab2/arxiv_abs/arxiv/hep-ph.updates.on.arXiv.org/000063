A global fit of parameters allows us to pin down the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) effective Lagrangian,
which we apply for the prediction of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the
muon g-2. The latter is dominated by the annihilation channel e+e- -> pi+pi-, for which data are
available by scan (CMD-2 and SND) and ISR (KLOE-2008, KLOE-2010 and BaBar) experiments. It is well
known that the different data sets are not in satisfactory agreement. In fact it is possible to fix
the model parameters without using the pi+pi- data, by using instead the dipion spectra measured
in the tau decays together with experimental spectra for the pi0 gamma, eta gamma, pi+pi-pi0, K+K-,
K0bar K0 final states supplemented by specific meson decay properties. Among these, the accepted
decay width for rho0 -> e+e- and the partial widths and phase information for the omega/phi ->
pi+pi- transitions, are considered. It is then shown that, relying on this global data set, the HLS
model, appropriately broken, allows to predict accurately the pion form factor up to 1.05 GeV. It
is shown that the data samples provided by CMD-2, SND and KLOE-2010 behave consistently with each
other and with the other considered data. Consistency problems with the KLOE-2008 and BaBar data
samples are substantiated. "All data" global fits are investigated by applying reweighting the
conflicting data sets. Constraining to our best fit, the broken HLS model yields a_mu(th) = (11659169.55
[+1.26 -0.59]_phi +[+0.00 -2.00]_tau +/- 5.21_(th))~10**-10 associated with a very good global
fit probability. Correspondingly, we find that Delta a_mu=a_mu (exp)- a_mu (th) exhibits a significance
ranging between 4.7 and 4.9 sigma.
