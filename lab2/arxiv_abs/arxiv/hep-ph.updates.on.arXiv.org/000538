We have performed the most comprehensive resonance-model fit of $ \pi^-\pi^-\pi^+$ states using
the results of our previously published partial-wave analysis (PWA) of a large data set of diffractive-dissociation
events from the reaction $\pi^- + p \to \pi^-\pi^-\pi^+ + p_{recoil}$ with a 190 GeV/${\it c}$ pion
beam. The PWA results, which were obtained in 100~bins of three-pion mass, 0.5 < $m_{3\pi}$ < 2.5
GeV/${\it c}^2$, and simultaneously in 11 bins of the reduced four-momentum transfer squared,
0.1 < $t'$ < 1.0 (GeV/${\it c})^2$, are subjected to a resonance-model fit using Breit-Wigner amplitudes
to simultaneously describe a subset of 14 selected waves using 11 isovector light-meson states
with $J^{PC} = 0^{-+}$, $1^{++}$, $2^{++}$, $2^{-+}$, $4^{++}$, and spin-exotic $1^{-+}$ quantum
numbers. The model contains the well-known resonances $\pi$(1800), $a_1$(1260), $a_2$(1320),
$\pi_2$(1670), $\pi_2$(1880), and $a_4$(2040). In addition, it includes the disputed $\pi_1$(1600),
the excited states $a_1$(1640), $a_2$(1700), and $\pi_2$(2005), as well as the resonance-like
$a_1$(1420). We measure the resonance parameters mass and width of these objects by combining the
information from the PWA results obtained in the 11 $t'$ bins. We extract the relative branching
fractions of the $\rho$(770)$\pi$ and $f_2$(1270)$\pi$ decays of $a_2$(1320) and $a_4$(2040),
where the former one is measured for the first time. In a novel approach, we extract the $t'$ dependence
of the intensity of the resonances and of their phases. The $t'$ dependence of the intensities of
most resonances differs distinctly from the $t'$ dependence of the nonresonant components.
