We study high-energy neutrino emissions from tidal disruption remnants around supermassive black
holes (SMBHs). The neutrinos are produced by the decay of charged pions originated in ultra-relativistic
protons which are accelerated there. In the standard theory of tidal disruption events (TDEs),
there are four distinct phases from the circularization of stellar debris to super- and sub-Eddington
accretion flows to radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). In addition, we consider
the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state in both the super-Eddington accretion and RIAF phases.
We find that there are three promising cases to produce neutrino emissions: the super-Eddington
accretion phase with the MAD state and the RIAF phase with both non-MAD and MAD states. In the super-Eddington
MAD state, the enhanced magnetic field makes it possible to accelerate the protons up to an energy
of E_{p,max}~0.35 PeV (M_{bh}/10^{7.7}M_sun)^{41/48} with the other given appropriate parameters.
The neutrino energy estimated at the peak of the energy spectrum is then E_{nu, pk}~67TeV(M_bh/10^{7.7}Msun)^{41/48}.
For M_bh>~10^{7.7}Msun, the neutrino light curve is proportional to t^{-65/24}, while it follows
the standard t^{-5/3} decay rate for M_{bh}<10^{7.7}M_sun. In both cases, the neutrino luminosity
is nearly Eddington. Such a high luminosity and characteristic light curve diagnose the MAD state
in TDEs. In the RIAF phase, we find E_{p, max}~0.45PeV(M_bh/10^7Msun)^{5/3} and E_{nu,pk}~0.35PeV(M_bh/10^7Msun)^{5/3},
and its light curve is proportional to t^{-10/3}. This indicates one can identify if the existed
RIAFs are the TDE origin or not. Although E_{p,max}~25PeV(M_bh/10^7Msun)^{-1/12} in the RIAF
with the MAD state, the resultant neutrino luminosity is too weak to be detected with IceCube. The
tidal disruption remnants are potentially a population of hidden neutrino sources invisible in
gamma rays.
