With the goal of increasing the precision of NLO QCD predictions for the $pp\to t\bar{t} \gamma$
process in the di-lepton top quark decay channel we present theoretical predictions for the ${\cal
R}= \sigma_{t\bar{t}\gamma}/\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ cross section ratio. Results for the latter
together with various differential cross section ratios are given for the LHC with the Run II energy
of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Fully realistic NLO computations for $t\bar{t}$ and $t\bar{t}\gamma$ production
are employed. They are based on matrix elements for $e^+\nu_e \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu b\bar{b}$ and
$e^+\nu_e \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu b\bar{b}\gamma$ processes and include all resonant and non-resonant
diagrams, interferences, and off-shell effects of the top quarks and the $W$ gauge bosons. Various
renormalisation and factorisation scale choices and parton density functions are examined to
assess their impact on the cross section ratio. Depending on the transverse momentum cut on the hard
photon a judicious choice of a dynamical scale allows us to obtain $1\%-3\%$ percent precision on
${\cal R}$. Moreover, for differential cross section ratios theoretical uncertainties in the
range of $1\%-6\%$ have been estimated. Until now such high precision predictions have only been
reserved for the top quark pair production at NNLO QCD. Thus, ${\cal R}$ at NLO in QCD represents a
very precise observable to be measured at the LHC for example to study the top quark charge asymmetry
or to probe the strength and the structure of the $t$-$\bar{t}$-$\gamma$ vertex. The latter can
shed some light on possible new physics that can reveal itself only once sufficiently precise theoretical
predictions are available.
