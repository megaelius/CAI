Extra dimensions can be very useful tools when constructing new physics models. Previously, we
began investigating toy models for the 5-D analog of the kinetic mixing/vector portal scenario
where the interactions of bulk dark matter with the brane-localized fields of the Standard Model
are mediated by a massive $U(1)_D$ dark photon also living in the bulk. In that setup, where the dark
matter was taken to be a complex scalar, a number of nice features were obtained such as $U(1)_D$ breaking
by boundary conditions without the introduction of a dark Higgs field, the absence of potentially
troublesome SM Higgs-dark singlet mixing, also by boundary conditions, the natural similarity
of the dark matter and dark photon masses and the decoupling of the heavy gauge Kaluza-Klein states
from the Standard Model. In the present paper we extend this approach by examining the more complex
cases of Dirac and Majorana fermionic dark matter. In particular, we discuss a new mechanism that
can occur in 5-D (but not in 4-D) that allows for light Dirac dark matter in the $\sim 100$ MeV mass range,
even though it has an $s$-wave annihilation into Standard Model fields, by avoiding the strong constraints
that arise from both the CMB and 21 cm data. This mechanism makes use of the presence of the Kaluza-Klein
excitations of the dark photon to extremize the increase in the annihilation cross section usually
obtained via resonant enhancement. In the Majorana dark matter case, we explore the possibility
of a direct $s$-channel dark matter pair-annihilation process producing the observed relic density,
due to the general presence of parity-violating dark matter interactions, without employing the
usual co-annihilation mechanism which is naturally suppressed in this 5-D setup.
