Supergravity (SUGRA) theories are specified by a few functions, most notably the real K\"ahler
function denoted by $G(T_i, \bar {T}_i) = K + \log |W|^2$, where K is a real K\"ahler potential, and
W is a holomorphic superpotential. A field redefinition $T_i \rightarrow f_1(T_i)$ does not change
neither the theory, nor the K\"ahler geometry. Similarly, the K\"ahler transformation, $K \rightarrow
K + f_2 + \bar f_2, W \rightarrow e^{-f_2} W$ where $f_2$ is holomorphic also leaves G and hence the
theory and the geometry invariant. However, if we perform a field redefinition only in $K(T_i,\bar{T}_i)
\rightarrow K(f(T_i),f(\bar{T}_i))$, while keeping the same superpotential $W(T_i)$, we get
a different theory, as G is not invariant under such a transformation while maintaining the same
K\"ahler geometry. This freedom of choosing $f(T_i)$ allows constructing an infinite number of
new theories given a fixed K\"ahler geometry and a predetermined superpotential W. Our construction
generalizes previous ones that were limited by the holomorphic property of $W$. In particular it
allows for novel inflationary SUGRA models and particle phenomenology model building, where the
different models correspond to different choices of field redefinitions. We demonstrate this
possibility by constructing several prototypes of inflationary models (hilltop, Starobinsky-like,
plateau, log-squared and bell-curve) all in flat K\"ahler geometry and an originally renormalizable
superpotential $W$. The models are in accord with current observations and predict $r\in[10^{-6},0.06]$
spanning several decades that can be easily obtained. In the bell-curve model, there also exists
a built-in gravitational reheating mechanism with $T_R\sim \mathcal{O}( 10^7 GeV)$.
