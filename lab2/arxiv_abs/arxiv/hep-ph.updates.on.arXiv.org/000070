We discuss the thermodynamics of the O(N) model across the corresponding phase transition using
the two-loop Phi-derivable approximation of the effective potential and compare our results to
those obtained in the literature within the Hartree-Fock approximation. In particular, we find
that in the chiral limit the transition is of the second order, whereas it was found to be of the first
order in the Hartree-Fock case. These features are manifest at the level of the thermodynamical
observables. We also compute the thermal sigma and pion masses from the curvature of the effective
potential. In the chiral limit, this guarantees that the Goldstone's theorem is obeyed in the broken
phase. A realistic parametrization of the model in the N=4 case, based on the vacuum values of the
curvature masses, shows that a sigma mass of around 450 MeV can be obtained. The equations are renormalized
after extending our previous results for the N=1 case by means of the general procedure described
in [J. Berges et al., Annals Phys. 320, 344-398 (2005)]. When restricted to the Hartree-Fock approximation,
our approach reveals that certain problems raised in the literature concerning the renormalization
are completely lifted. Finally, we introduce a new type of Phi-derivable approximation in which
the gap equation is not solved at the same level of accuracy as the accuracy at which the potential
is computed. We discuss the consistency and applicability of these types of "hybrid" approximations
and illustrate them in the two-loop case by showing that the corresponding effective potential
is renormalizable and that the transition remains of the second order.
