In this work, we propose a strategy to construct an event classifier sensitive to Multi-Parton Interactions
(MPI) using Machine Learning-based regression. The study is conducted using TMVA and the event
generator PYTHIA 8.244. The regression is performed with Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). Event properties
like forward charged-particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity and the average transverse
momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) are used for training. The kinematic cuts are defined in accordance with
the ALICE detector capabilities. Charged-particle production in events with large number of MPI
(${\rm N}_{\rm mpi}$) is normalized to that obtained in minimum bias pp collisions. After the normalization
to the corresponding $\langle {\rm N}_{\rm mpi} \rangle$, the ratios as a function of $p_{\rm T}$
exhibit a bump at $p_{\rm T} \approx 3$ GeV/$c$; and for higher $p_{\rm T}$ ($>8$ GeV/$c$), the ratios
are independent of ${\rm N}_{\rm mpi}$. While the size of the bump increases with increasing ${\rm
N}_{\rm mpi}$, the behavior at high $p_{\rm T}$ is expected from the "binary scaling" (parton-parton
interactions), which holds given the absence of any parton-energy loss mechanism in PYTHIA. The
effects are also observed when particle production is studied as a function of the target variable
(${\rm N}_{\rm mpi}^{\rm reg}$). Therefore, its implementation on the high-multiplicity pp data
would provide valuable information to understand the heavy ion-like effects discovered in small
systems. Regarding the application of the trained BDT on the existing pp data, we report that for
events with at least one primary charged-particle within $|\eta|<1$ (${\rm INEL}>0$), the average
number of MPI in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ and 13 TeV are 3.76$\pm1.01$ and 4.65$\pm1.01$,
respectively.
