Semi-hard processes in the large COM energy limit offer us an exclusive chance to test the dynamics
behind strong interactions in kinematical sectors so far unexplored. In the Regge limit, fixed-order
calculations in pQCD based on collinear factorisation miss the effect of large energy logs, which
are so large to compensate the small QCD coupling $\alpha_s$ and must therefore be accounted for
to all perturbative orders.. The BFKL approach represents the most powerful tool to resum to all
orders these large logs both in the LLA and in the NLA. The inclusive hadroproduction of forward jets
with high transverse momenta separated by a large rapidity interval at the LHC (Mueller--Navelet
jets) has been one of the most studied reactions so far. Interesting observables associated to this
process are the azimuthal correlations, showing a very good agreement with experimental data at
the LHC. However, new BFKL-sensitive observables should be considered in the context of the LHC
physics program. With the aim the to further and deeply probe the dynamics of QCD in the Regge limit,
we give phenomenological predictions for four distinct semi-hard process. On one hand, we continue
the analysis of reactions with two objects identified in the final state $(i)$ by addressing open
problems in the Mueller--Navelet sector and $(ii)$ by studying the inclusive dihadron production
in the full NLA BKFL accuracy. On the other hand, we show how inclusive multi-jet production processes
allow us to define new, generalised and suitable BFKL observables, where transverse momenta and
rapidities of the tagged jets, well separated in rapidity from each other, appear in new combinations.
We give the first predictions for the inclusive three-jet production, encoding the effects of higher-order
BFKL corrections. Then, making use of the same formalism, we present the first complete BFKL analysis
for the four-jet production.
