We explore 4d Yang-Mills gauge theories (YM) living as boundary conditions of 5d gapped short/long-range
entangled (SRE/LRE) topological states. Specifically, we explore 4d time-reversal symmetric
pure YM of an SU(2) gauge group with a second-Chern-class topological term at $\theta=\pi$ (SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$
YM), by turning on background fields for both the time-reversal (i.e., on unorientable manifolds)
and 1-form center global symmetry. We find Four Siblings of SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$ YM with distinct
couplings to background fields, labeled by $(K_1, K_2)$: $K_1=0,1$ specifies Kramers singlet/doublet
Wilson line and new mixed higher 't Hooft anomalies; $K_2=0,1$ specifies boson/fermionic Wilson
line and a new Wess-Zumino-Witten-like counterterm. Higher anomalies indicate that to realize
all higher $n$-global symmetries locally on $n$-simplices, the 4d theory becomes a boundary of
a 5d higher-symmetry-protected topological state (SPTs, as an invertible topological quantum
field theory in math, or as a 5d higher-symmetric interacting topological superconductor in condensed
matter). Via Weyl's gauge principle, by dynamically gauging the 1-form symmetry, we transform
a 5d bulk SRE SPTs into an LRE symmetry-enriched topologically ordered state (SETs); thus we obtain
the 4d SO(3)$_{\theta=\pi}$ YM-5d LRE-higher-SETs coupled system with higher-form gauge fields.
We further derive new exotic anyonic statistics of extended objects such as 2-worldsheet of strings
and 3-worldvolume of branes, physically characterizing the 5d SETs. We discover triple and quadruple
link invariants potentially associated with the underlying 5d higher-gauge TQFTs, hinting a new
intrinsic relation between non-supersymmetric 4d pure YM and topological links in 5d. We provide
4d-5d lattice simplicial complex regularizations and bridge to 4d SU(2) and SO(3)-gauged quantum
spin liquids as 3+1 dimensional realizations.
