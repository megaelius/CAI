Models of radiative Majorana neutrino masses require new scalars and/or fermions to induce lepton
number violating interactions. We show that these new particles also generate observable neutrino
nonstandard interactions (NSI) with matter. We classify radiative models as type-I or II, with
type-I models containing at least one Standard Model (SM) particle inside the loop diagram generating
neutrino mass, and type-II models having no SM particle inside the loop. While type-II radiative
models do not generate NSI at tree-level, popular models which fall under the type-I category are
shown, somewhat surprisingly, to generate observable NSI at tree-level, while being consistent
with direct and indirect constraints from colliders, electroweak precision data and charged lepton
flavor violation (cLFV). We survey such models where neutrino masses arise at one, two and three
loops. In the prototypical Zee model which generates neutrino masses via one-loop diagrams involving
charged scalars, we find that diagonal NSI can be as large as ($8\%, 3.8\%, 43\%$) for ($\varepsilon_{ee},\varepsilon_{\mu
\mu}, \varepsilon_{\tau \tau}$), while off-diagonal NSI can be at most ($1.5 \times 10^{-3}\%,
0.56\%, 0.34\%$) for ($\varepsilon_{e\mu},\varepsilon_{e \tau}, \varepsilon_{\mu \tau}$).
In radiative neutrino mass models using leptoquarks (LQs), $(\varepsilon_{\mu\mu},\, \varepsilon_{\tau\tau})$
can be as large as $(21.6\%,\,51.7\%)$, while $\varepsilon_{ee}$ and $(\varepsilon_{e\mu},\,
\varepsilon_{e\tau},\,\varepsilon_{\mu\tau})$ can at most be 0.6\%. The most stringent constraints
on the diagonal NSI are found to come from neutrino oscillation and scattering experiments, while
the off-diagonal NSI are mostly constrained by low-energy processes, such as atomic parity violation
and cLFV. We also comment on the future sensitivity of these models in long-baseline experiments,
such as DUNE.
