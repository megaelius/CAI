We review an effective field theory approach to dense compact-star matter that exploits the Cheshire
Cat Principle for hadron-quark continuity at high density, adhering only to hadronic degrees of
freedom, hidden topology and hidden symmetries of QCD. No Landau-Ginzburg-Wilsonian-type phase
transition is involved in the range of densities involved. The microscopic degrees of freedom of
QCD, i.e., quarks and gluons, possibly intervening at high baryonic density are traded in for fractionalized
topological objects. The partial emergence of scale symmetry is signaled by a dilatonic scalar
in a "pseudo-conformal" structure. Flavor gauge symmetry manifests with the $\rho$ meson mass
going toward a Wilsonian RG fixed point identified with the "vector manifestation fixed point"
at which the flavor gauge boson mass goes to zero. Parity doubling is to take place as the quasi-nucleon
mass converges to the chiral invariant $m_0$. The theory with a few controllable parameters accounts
satisfactorily for {\it all} known properties of normal nuclear matter and makes certain predictions
that are drastically different from what's available in the literature. In particular, it provides
a robust topological mechanism for the cross-over from soft-to-hard equation of state that predicts
the star properties in overall agreement with the presently available data, including $M_{max}\sim
2.3 M_\odot$ and the recent LIGO/Virgo gravity-wave data. What is most glaringly different from
{\it all other} approaches known, however, is the prediction for the {\it rapid convergence} to
a sound velocity of star $v_s^2\approx 1/3$ {(in unit $c=1$)} at a density $n\gsim 3 n_0$, far from
the asymptotic density $\gsim 50n_0$ expected in perturbative QCD. We interpret this to signal
the precocious emergence in compact-star matter of a pseudo-conformal structure associated with
the hidden symmetries.
