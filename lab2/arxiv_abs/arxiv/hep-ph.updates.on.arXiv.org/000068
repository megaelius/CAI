Elliptic flow of direct photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions is believed to be dominated
by contribution from thermal radiation of quark gluon plasma up to $p_T$ $\sim 5$ GeV/$c$, although
other sources start outshining the thermal contribution at already smaller values of $p_T$ in the
direct photon spectrum. The elliptic flow of thermal photons from ideal hydrodynamics considering
a smooth initial density distribution under-predicts the PHENIX direct photon data from 200A GeV
Au+Au collisions at RHIC by a large margin in the range $1 < p_T < 5$ GeV/$c$. However, a significant
enhancement of thermal photon production due to fluctuations in the initial QCD matter density
distributions is expected. We show that such fluctuations result in substantially larger photon
elliptic flow for $p_T > 2.5 $ GeV/$c$ compared to a smooth initial-state-averaged density profile.
The results from event-by-event hydrodynamics are found to be sensitive to the fluctuation size
parameter. However, the effects of initial state fluctuations are insufficient to account for
the discrepancy to the PHENIX data for direct photon elliptic flow. Furthermore, the photon $v_2$
is reduced even more when we include the NLO pQCD prompt photon component. We also calculate the spectra
and elliptic flow of thermal photons for 2.76A TeV Pb+Pb collisions at LHC and for the 0--40% centrality
bin. Thermal photons from event-by-event hydrodynamics along with prompt photons from NLO pQCD
calculations explain the ALICE preliminary direct photon data well in the region $p_T \ge 2.5$ GeV/c.
Similar to RHIC, the elliptic flow results at LHC are again found to be much smaller than the ALICE
preliminary $v_2$ data.
