Finetuning and Naturalness are extra-empirical theory assessments that reflect our expectation
how scientific theories should provide an intuitive understanding about the foundations underlying
the observed phenomena. Recently, the absence of new physics at the LHC and the theoretical evidence
for a multiverse of alternative physical realities, predicted by our best fundamental theories,
have casted doubts about the validity of these concepts. In this essay we argue that the discussion
about Finetuning should not predominantly concentrate on the desired features a fundamental theory
is expected to have, but rather on the question what a theory needs to qualify as fundamental in the
first place. By arguing that a fundamental description of the Universe should possess zero entropy,
we develop a 'holistic' concept for the most fundamental layer of reality: The fundamental description
of the Universe is the Universe itself, understood as an entangled quantum state. Adopting a universal
applicability of quantum mechanics, in this framework the behavior of subsystems can be understood
as the perspectival experience of an entangled quantum Universe perceived through the "lens of
decoherence". In this picture the fundamental reality is non-local, and finetuned coincidences
in effective theories may be understood in a way similar to EPR-correlations. This notion provides
a fresh view on the topic of Naturalness and Finetuning since it suggests that Finetuning problems
and hints for anthropic explanations are an artefact of theories building up on subsystems rather
than on the fundamental description. Recent work in quantum gravity aiming at an understanding
of spacetime geometry from entanglement entropy could be interpreted as a first sign of such a paradigm
shift.
