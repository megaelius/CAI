Calculating the quantum evolution of a de Sitter universe on superhorizon scales is notoriously
difficult. To address this challenge, we introduce the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET).
This framework holds for superhorizon modes whose comoving momentum is far below the UV scale, which
is set by the inverse comoving horizon. The SdSET is formulated using the same approach that yields
the Heavy Quark Effective Theory. The degrees of freedom that capture the long wavelength dynamics
are identified with the growing and decaying solutions to the equations of motion. The operator
expansion is organized using a power counting scheme, and loops can be regulated while respecting
the low energy symmetries. For massive quantum fields in a fixed de Sitter background, power counting
implies that all interactions beyond the horizon are irrelevant. Alternatively, if the fields
are very light, the leading interactions are at most marginal, and resumming the associated logarithms
using (dynamical) renormalization group techniques yields the evolution equation for canonical
stochastic inflation. The SdSET is also applicable to models where gravity is dynamical, including
inflation. In this case, diffeomorphism invariance ensures that all interactions are irrelevant,
trivially implying the all-orders conservation of adiabatic density fluctuations and gravitational
waves. We briefly touch on the application to slow-roll eternal inflation by identifying novel
relevant operators. This work serves to demystify many aspects of perturbation theory outside
the horizon, and has a variety of applications to problems of cosmological interest.
