We find an asymptotic solution for two- and three-point correlators of local gauge-invariant operators,
in a lower-spin sector of massless large-$N$ $QCD$ (and of massless large-$N$ $\cal{N}$ $=1$ $SUSY$
$QCD$), in terms of glueball and meson propagators (and of their $SUSY$ partners), by means of a new
purely field-theoretical technique that we call the asymptotically-free bootstrap. The asymptotically-free
bootstrap exploits the lowest-order conformal invariance of connected correlators of gauge invariant
composite operators in perturbation theory, the renormalization-group improvement, and a recently-proved
asymptotic structure theorem for glueball and meson propagators (and for their $SUSY$ partners),
that involves the unknown particle spectrum and the anomalous dimension of operators for fixed
spin. In principle the asymptotically-free bootstrap extends to all the higher-spin two- and three-point
correlators whose lowest-order conformal limit is non-vanishing in perturbation theory, and
by means of the operator product expansion to the corresponding asymptotic multi-point correlators
as well. Besides, the asymptotically-free bootstrap provides asymptotic $S$-matrix amplitudes
in massless large-$N$ $QCD$ (and in $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SUSY$ $QCD$) in terms of glueball and meson
propagators (and their $SUSY$ partners) as opposed to perturbation theory. Remarkably, the asymptotic
$S$-matrix depends only on the unknown particle spectrum, but not on the anomalous dimensions.
Practically, as just a few examples among many more, it follows the structure of the light by light
scattering amplitude, of the pion form factor, and the associated vector dominance. Theoretically,
the asymptotic solution sets the strongest constraints on any actual solution of large-$N$ $QCD$
(and of $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SUSY$$QCD$), and in particular on any string solution.
