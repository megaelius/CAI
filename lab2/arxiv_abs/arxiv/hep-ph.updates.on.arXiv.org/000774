We study the invariant-mass distributions of dileptons produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions at very low pair transverse momenta, $P_T\leq 0.15$ GeV. Specifically, we investigate
the interplay of thermal radiation with initial photon annihilation processes, $\gamma \gamma
\to l^+ l^-$, triggered by the coherent electromagnetic fields of the incoming nuclei. For the thermal
radiation, we employ the emission from the QGP and hadronic phases with in-medium vector spectral
functions which describes the inclusive excess radiation observed over a wide range of collision
energies. For the coherent photon fusion processes, whose spectrum is much softer than for thermal
radiation, we employ initial fluxes from the Fourier transform of charge distributions of the colliding
nuclei in the equivalent-photon approximation. We first verify that the combination of photon
fusion, thermal radiation and final-state hadron decays gives a fair description of the low-$P_T$
dilepton mass spectra as recently measured by the STAR collaboration in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV
Au+Au collisions for different centrality classes, including experimental acceptance cuts.
The coherent contribution dominates in peripheral collisions, while thermal radiation shows
a markedly stronger increase with centrality. We perform similar calculations at lower collision
energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=17.3 GeV) and compare to the acceptance-corrected dimuon excess spectra
measured by the NA60 experiment at the CERN SPS; here, the contribution from photoproduction is
subleading. We also provide predictions for the ALICE experiment at the LHC; the pertinent excitation
function from SPS to LHC energies reveals a nontrivial interplay of photoproduction and thermal
radiation.
