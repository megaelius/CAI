Studies of strong field particle physics processes in electron/laser interactions and lepton
collider interaction points are reviewed. These processes are defined by the high intensity of
the electromagnetic fields involved and the need to take them into account as fully as possible.
The main theoretical framework considered is the Furry picture. In this framework, the influence
of a background electromagnetic field in the Lagrangian is calculated non perturbatively, involving
exact solutions for quantised charged particles in the background field. These "dressed" particles
go on to interact perturbatively with other particles. The background field starts to polarise
the vacuum, in effect rendering it a dispersive medium. Particles encountering this dispersive
vacuum obtain a lifetime, either radiating or decaying into pair particles at a rate dependent on
the intensity of the background field. In fact, the intensity of the background field enters into
the coupling constant of the strong field QED Lagrangian, influencing all particle processes.
A number of new phenomena occur. Particles gain an intensity dependent rest mass shift that accounts
for their presence in the dispersive vacuum. Multi photon events involving more than one external
field photon occur at each vertex. Higher order processes which exchange a virtual strong field
particle, resonate via the lifetimes of the unstable strong field states. Two main arenas of strong
field physics are reviewed; those occurring in relativistic electron interactions with intense
laser beams, and those occurring in the beam beam physics at the interaction point of colliders.
This review outlines the theory, describes its significant novel phenomenology and details the
experimental schema required to detect strong field effects and the simulation programs required
to model them.
