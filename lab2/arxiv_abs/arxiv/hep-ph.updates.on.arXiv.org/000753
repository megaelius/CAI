Weak capture in muonic hydrogen ($\mu$H) as a probe of the chiral properties and nucleon structure
predictions of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is reviewed. A recent determination of the axial-vector
charge radius squared, $r_A^2(z\; {\rm exp.}) = 0.46(22)\;{\rm fm}^2$, from a model independent
$z$ expansion analysis of neutrino-nucleon scattering data is employed in conjunction with the
MuCap measurement of the singlet muonic hydrogen capture rate, $\Lambda_{\rm singlet}^{\rm MuCap}
= 715.6(7.4)\;{\rm s}^{-1}$, to update the induced pseudoscalar nucleon coupling: $\bar{g}_P^{\rm
MuCap} = 8.23(83)$ derived from experiment, and $\bar{g}_P^{\rm theory} = 8.25(25)$ predicted
by chiral perturbation theory. Accounting for correlated errors this implies $\bar{g}_P^{\rm
theory}/\bar{g}_P^{\rm MuCap}= 1.00(8)$, confirming theory at the 8\% level. If instead, the
predicted expression for $\bar{g}_P^{\rm theory}$ is employed as input, then the capture rate
alone determines $r_A^2(\mu {\rm H})=0.46(24)\, {\rm fm}^2$, or together with the independent
$z$ expansion neutrino scattering results, a weighted average $r_A^2({\rm ave.}) = 0.46(16)\,
{\rm fm}^2$. Sources of theoretical uncertainty are critically examined and potential experimental
improvements are described that can reduce the capture rate error by about a factor of 3. Muonic hydrogen
can thus provide a precise and independent $r_A^2$ value which may be compared with other determinations,
such as ongoing lattice gauge theory calculations. The importance of an improved $r_A^2$ determination
for phenomenology is illustrated by considering the impact on critical neutrino-nucleus cross
sections at neutrino oscillation experiments.
