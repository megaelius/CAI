Dynamical energy loss formalism allows generating state-of-the-art suppression predictions
in finite size QCD medium, employing a sophisticated model of high-$p_\perp$ parton interactions
with QGP. We here report a major step of introducing medium evolution in the formalism though $1+1D$
Bjorken (``B'') expansion, while preserving all complex features of the original dynamical energy
loss framework. We use this framework to provide joint $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ predictions, for the first
time within the dynamical energy loss formalism in evolving QCD medium. The predictions are generated
for a wide range of observables, i.e. for all types of probes (both light and heavy) and for all centrality
regions in both $Pb+Pb$ and $Xe+Xe$ collisions at the LHC. Where experimental data are available,
DREENA-B framework leads to a good joint agreement with $v_2$ and $R_{AA}$ data. Such agreement
is encouraging, i.e. may lead us closer to resolving $v_2$ puzzle (difficulty of previous models
to jointly explain $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data), though this still remains to be thoroughly tested by
including state-of-the-art medium evolution within DREENA framework. While introducing medium
evolution significantly changes $v_2$ predictions, $R_{AA}$ predictions remain robust and moreover
in a good agreement with the experimental data; $R_{AA}$ observable is therefore suitable for calibrating
parton-medium interaction model, independently from the medium evolution. Finally, for heavy
flavor, we observe a strikingly similar signature of the dead-cone effect on both $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$
- we also provide a simple analytical understanding behind this result. Overall, the results presented
here indicate that DREENA framework is a reliable tool for QGP tomography.
