Interest in studying the inclusive photon induced processes of Deep-Inelastic Scattering (DIS)
and Diffractive DIS (DDIS) at high energies includes their experimental investigation and thorough
theoretical description. The conventional instrument for theoretical investigation of DIS at
large x is DGLAP. It describes the Q^2-evolution. Description of DIS in the small-x region requires
accounting for the both Q^2 and x -evolution at the same time. Combining DGLAP with total resummation
of double logarithms of x and Q^2, we present a description of structure function F_1 at large Q^2
and arbitrary x. Making use of the necessity of the shift of Q^2 in order to regulate infrared singularities,
we obtain an expression for F_1 valid at arbitrary x and Q^2. The obtained expressions coincide with
the DLA expressions at small x and at the same time coincides with the DGLAP result at large x and large
Q^2. Accounting for virtualities k^2 of the external partons allows us to obtain expressions for
F_1 in K_T-Factorization, which are valid at arbitrary Q^2 and arbitrary relations between Q^2
and k^2. Expressions for F_1 in all types of QCD factorization exhibit the small-x asymptotics of
the Pomeron type. This Pomeron is generated by the high-energy asymptotics of amplitudes of the
2 -> 2 parton-parton forward scattering. These amplitudes are calculated in DLA, so their asymptotics
have nothing to do with the BFKL Pomeron. We demonstrate that the parton-parton amplitudes can be
used in the DDIS models instead of BFKL Pomeron or combinations of hard and soft Pomerons at non-asymptotic
energies. On the other hand, this modification automatically ensures the Pomerons asymptotics,
which simplifies and makes more consistent theory of DDIS.
