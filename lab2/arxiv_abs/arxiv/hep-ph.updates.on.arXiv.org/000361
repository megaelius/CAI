Recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of deformed uranium-uranium ($U$-$U$)
collisions in its various geometrical configurations due to their usefulness in understanding
the different aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this paper we have studied the particle
production in deformed $U$-$U$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = $193$ GeV using modified wounded
quark model (WQM). At first, we have shown the variation of quark-nucleus inelastic scattering
cross-section ($\sigma_{qA}^{in}$) with respect to centralities for various geometrical orientations
of $U$-$U$ collisions in WQM. After that we have calculated the pseudorapidity density ($dn_{ch}/d\eta$)
within WQM using two-component prescription. Further we have calculated the transverse energy
density distribution ($dE_{T}/d\eta$) along with the ratio of transverse energy to charged hadron
multiplicity ($E_{T}/N_{ch}$) for $U$-$U$ collisions and compared them with the corresponding
experimental data. We have shown the scaling behavior of $dn_{ch}/d\eta$ and $dE_{T}/d\eta$ for
different initial geometry of $U$-$U$ collision with respect to $p$-$p$ data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$
GeV. Furthermore we have shown the Bjorken energy density achieved in $U$-$U$ collisions for various
configurations and compared them with experimental data of $Au$-$Au$ at 200 GeV. We observe that
the present model suitably describes the experimental data for minimum bias geometrical configuration
of $U$-$U$ collisions. An estimate for various observables in different initial geometries of
$U$-$U$ collisions is also presented which will be tested in future by experimental data.
