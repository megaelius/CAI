We discuss production of open charm mesons in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The cross section
for inclusive production of $c \bar c$ pairs is calculated within the $k_{\perp}$-factorization
approach in which a major part of higher-order corrections is belived to be effectively included.
We use and test the applicability of several unintegrated gluon distributions. Numerical results
of the $k_{\perp}$-factorization approach are compared to NLO pQCD collinear predictions. Inclusive
differential distributions in transverse momentum and (pseudo)rapidity of several charmed mesons
are presented and compared to recent results of the ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb collaborations. We also
examine production of neutral charmed meson-antimeson pairs ($D^0 {\overline D^0}$) in unique
kinematics of forward rapidities of the LHCb experiment. Kinematical correlations in azimuthal
angle $\varphi_{D^0 {\overline D^0}}$, invariant mass $M_{D^0 {\overline D^0}}$ and rapidity
difference $Y_{D^0 {\overline D^0}}$ distributions are calculated. Moreover, we also discuss
production of two pairs of $c \bar c$ within a simple formalism of double-parton scattering (DPS).
We compare results of calculations of single-parton scattering (SPS) and double-parton scattering
(DPS) for production of $c \bar c c \bar c$ and for $D^0-D^0$ meson-meson correlations. We compare
our predictions for double charm production with recent results of the LHCb collaboration for azimuthal
angle $\varphi_{D^0 D^0}$ distribution, dimeson invariant mass $M_{D^0 D^0}$ and rapidity distance
between mesons $Y_{D^0 D^0}$. The obtained results clearly certify the dominance of DPS in the production
of events with double charm.
