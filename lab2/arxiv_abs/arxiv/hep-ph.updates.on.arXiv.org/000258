We present a new formalism designed to discover dark matter annihilation occurring in the Milky
Way's dwarf galaxies. The statistical framework extracts all available information in the data
by simultaneously combining observations of all the dwarf galaxies and incorporating the impact
of particle physics properties, the distribution of dark matter in the dwarfs, and the detector
response. The method performs maximally powerful frequentist searches and produces confidence
limits on particle physics parameters. Probability distributions of test statistics under various
hypotheses are constructed exactly, without relying on large sample approximations. The derived
limits have proper coverage by construction and claims of detection are not biased by imperfect
background modeling. We implement this formalism using data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
to search for an annihilation signal in the complete sample of Milky Way dwarfs whose dark matter
distributions can be reliably determined. We find that the observed data is consistent with background
for each of the dwarf galaxies individually as well as in a joint analysis. The strongest constraints
are at small dark matter particle masses. Taking the median of the systematic uncertainty in dwarf
density profiles, the cross section upper limits are below the pure s-wave weak scale relic abundance
value (2.2 x 10^-26 cm^3/s) for dark matter masses below 26 GeV (for annihilation into b quarks),
29 GeV (tau leptons), 35 GeV (up, down, strange, charm quarks and gluons), 6 GeV (electrons/positrons),
and 114 GeV (two-photon final state). For dark matter particle masses less than 1 TeV, these represent
the strongest limits obtained to date using dwarf galaxies.
