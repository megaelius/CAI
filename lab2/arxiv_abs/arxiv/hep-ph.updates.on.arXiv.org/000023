The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC have collected about 20 $fb^{-1}$ of data each at the
end of their 8 TeV run, and ruled out a huge swath of parameter space in the context of Minimally Supersymmetric
Standard Model(MSSM). Limits on masses of the gluino ($\tilde{g}$) and the squarks of the first
two generations($\tilde{q}$) have been pushed to the TeV range. Light third generation squarks
namely stop and sbottom of sub-TeV masses, on the other hand, are still allowed by their direct search
limits. Interestingly, the discovery of a Standard Model(SM) higgs boson like particle with a mass
of $\sim$ 125 GeV favours a light third generation which is also motivated by naturalness arguments.
Decays of stop and sbottom quarks can in general produce a number of distinct final states which necessitate
different search strategies in the collider experiments. In this paper we, on the other hand, propose
a general search strategy to look for third generation squarks in the final state which contains
a top quark in the sample along with two additional hard leptons and substantial missing transverse
momentum. We illustrate that a search strategy using the dileptonic $M_{T2}$, the effective mass
$m_{eff}$ and jet substructure to reconstruct the hadronic top quark can be very effective to reduce
the SM backgrounds. With the proposed search strategy, we estimate that the third generation squarks
with masses up to about 800 GeV can be probed at the 14 TeV LHC with a 100 $fb^{-1}$ data set. We also interpret
our results in two simplified scenarios where we consider the stop (sbottom) pair production followed
by their subsequent decay to a top quark and the second lightest neutralino (lightest chargino).
In this case also we find that stop (sbottom) mass up to 1 TeV (0.9 TeV) can be discovered at the 14 TeV
LHC with 100 $fb^{-1}$ integrated luminosity.
