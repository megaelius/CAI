The purpose of this review is to investigate what kind of physics can be extracted at the LHC, assuming
a discovery is made in events with missing transverse momentum, as generically expected in supersymmetry
(SUSY) with R-parity conservation. To set the scene, we first discuss the collider phenomenology
of the six possible electroweakino benchmark scenarios, as they provide valuable insight into
what one might be facing at the LHC. We review the existing methods for mass reconstruction from measured
kinematic endpoints in the distributions of suitable variables, e.g., the invariant masses of
various sets of visible decay products, as well as the $M_{T2}$ and the $M_2$ types of variables.
We propose to extend the application of these methods to the various topologies of fully hadronic
final states, possibly with hadronically reconstructed massive bosons (W, Z or h). We test the idea
with a simplified simulation of events in the main electroweakino benchmark scenarios. We find
that the fully hadronic events allow the complete determination of the relevant mass spectrum.
For comparison, we also review the potential of the standard kinematic endpoint methods for final
states involving leptons from the decays of (on-shell or off-shell) sleptons. We find that with
300 $fb^{-1}$, the statistics for the leptonic events is very marginal and they look less promising
than the fully hadronic channels. This corresponds to a complete reversal of the usual paradigm,
where leptonic events comprised the gold-plated SUSY channels. Finally, we put together all available
information and summarize what level of understanding of the underlying physics can be achieved.
We show that, as a by-product of the mass reconstruction, it is also possible to determine the production
cross sections and decay branching ratios, which in turn enable us to pinpoint the underlying model.
