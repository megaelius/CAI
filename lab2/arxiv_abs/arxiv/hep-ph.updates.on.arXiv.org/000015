The nucleon momentum distribution $n_A(k)$ for $A=$2, 3, 4, 16, and 40 nuclei is systematically
analyzed in terms of wave functions resulting from advanced solutions of the nonrelativistic Schr\"{o}dinger
equation, obtained within different many-body approaches. Particular attention is paid to the
separation of the momentum distributions into the mean-field and short-range correlations (SRC)
contributions. It is shown that at high values of the momentum $k$ the high-momentum components
($k\gtrsim 1.5-2$ fm$^{-1}$) of all nuclei considered are very similar, exhibiting the well-known
scaling behavior with the mass number $A$, independently of the used many-body approach and the
details of the bare $NN$ interaction. The number of $NN$ pairs in a given ($ST$) state, viz., ($ST$)=(10),
(00), (01), and (11), and the contribution of these states to the nucleon momentum distributions
are calculated. It is shown that, apart from the (00) state, which has very small effects, all other
spin-isospin states contribute to the momentum distribution in a wide range of momenta. It is shown
that that for all nuclei considered the momentum distributions in the states T=0 and T=1 exhibit
at $k\gtrsim 1.5-2$ fm$^{-1}$ very similar behaviors, which represents strong evidence of the
A-independent character of SRCs. The ratio $n_A(k)/n_D(k)$ is analyzed in detail stressing that
in the SRC region it always increases with the momentum and the origin of such an increase is discussed
and elucidated. The relationships between the one- and two-body momentum distributions, considered
in a previous paper, are discussed and clarified, pointing out the relevant role played by the center-of-mass
motion of a correlated pair in the (10) state. The relationship of the present approach with the many-body
methods based upon low-momentum effective interactions is briefly discussed.
