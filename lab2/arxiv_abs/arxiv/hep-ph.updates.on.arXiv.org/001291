We explore whether non-standard dark sector physics might be required to solve the existing cosmological
tensions. The properties we consider in combination are: \textit{(a)} an interaction between
the dark matter and dark energy components, and \textit{(b)} a dark energy equation of state $w$
different from that of the canonical cosmological constant $w=-1$. In principle, these two parameters
are independent. In practice, to avoid early-time, superhorizon instabilities, their allowed
parameter spaces are correlated. Moreover, a clear degeneracy exists between these two parameters
in the case of CMB data. We analyze three classes of extended interacting dark energy models in light
of the 2019 \textit{Planck} CMB results and Cepheid-calibrated local distance ladder $H_0$ measurements
of Riess et al. (R19), as well as recent BAO and SNeIa distance data. We find that in \textit{quintessence}
coupled dark energy models, where $w > -1$, the evidence for a non-zero coupling between the two dark
sectors can surpass the $5\sigma$ significance. Moreover, for both Planck+BAO or Planck+SNeIa,
we found a preference for $w>-1$ at about three standard deviations. Quintessence models are, therefore,
in excellent agreement with current data when an interaction is considered. On the other hand, in
\textit{phantom} coupled dark energy models, there is no such preference for a non-zero dark sector
coupling. All the models we consider significantly raise the value of the Hubble constant easing
the $H_0$ tension. In the interacting scenario, the disagreement between Planck+BAO and R19 is
considerably reduced from $4.3\sigma$ in the case of $\Lambda$CDM to about $2.5\sigma$. The addition
of low-redshift BAO and SNeIa measurements leaves, therefore, some residual tension with R19 but
at a level that could be justified by a statistical fluctuation. (abridged)
