Strong gravitational lensing is a promising way of uncovering the nature of dark matter, by finding
perturbations to images that cannot be well accounted for by modeling the lens galaxy without additional
structure, be it subhalos (smaller halos within the smooth lens) or line-of-sight (LOS) halos.
We present results attempting to infer the presence of substructure from images, without doing
any intermediate lens modeling, using a convolutional neural network (CNN). For images with a single
perturber, the network is able to infer their presence when they have masses as low as $\sim10^9$M$_{\odot}$,
even in the presence of $\sim30\%$ noise, if they lie within the main lens galaxy. Since less massive
foreground LOS halos can have the same effect as higher mass subhalos, the CNN can probe lower masses
in the halo mass function. If instead images are populated with multiple subhalos, the sensitivity
improves considerably: when the fraction of mass in substructure is $f_{\rm sub}=1\pm0.05\%$,
the NN is almost infallible at inferring the presence of subhalos even when the most massive subhalos
lie around $\sim10^7$M$_{\odot}$. With the expectation of experiments such as HST and Euclid yielding
thousands of high-quality strong lensing images in the next years, a method such as the one presented
in this work could complement direct detection efforts by being able to analyze thousands of images
in a fraction of a second to determine whether they are likely to have detectable substructure or
not, thus identifying promising candidates that merit further analysis to determine individual
subhalo properties while preventing extensive resources being used for images that would yield
null detections. By understanding the NN's sensitivity as a function of substructure mass, non-detections
could be combined with the information from images with substructure to constrain the cold dark
matter scenario.
