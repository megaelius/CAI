Within the covariant density functional theory of hypernuclear matter we build a series of equations
of state for hypernuclear compact stars, by calibrating the coupling constants of the $\Xi$-hyperon
to the experimental binding energy of the single-$\Xi$ hypernuclei $^{15}_{\Xi^-}$C and $^{12}_{\Xi^-}$Be.
Coupling constants of the $\Lambda$-hyperon to nucleons have been calibrated on a vast collection
of experimental data on single $\Lambda$-hypernuclei and we employ those values. Uncertainties
on the couplings of the $\Sigma$-hyperon to nuclear matter, due to lack of experimental data, are
accounted for by allowing for a wide variation of the well depth of $\Sigma$ at rest in symmetric saturated
nuclear matter. To account for uncertainties in the nucleonic sector at densities much larger than
the saturation density, a rich collection of parametrizations is employed, some of them in agreement
with existing constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysics. Neutron star properties are
investigated with all these calibrated equations of state. The effects of the presence of hyperons
on the radius, on the tidal deformability, on the moment of inertia, and on the nucleonic direct Urca
process are discussed. The sensitivity of the hyperonic direct Urca processes to uncertainties
in the nucleonic and hyperonic sectors is also addressed. It is shown that the relative variations
of the radius, tidal deformability and moment of inertia from the values that characterize purely
nucleonic stars are linearly correlated with the strangeness fraction. The maximum radius deviation,
obtained for most massive neutron stars, is $\approx 10\%$. The reduction of the maximum mass, triggered
by nucleation of strangeness, is estimated at $\approx 15 - 20\%$, out of which 5\% comes from insufficient
information on the $\Sigma$-hyperon interactions.
