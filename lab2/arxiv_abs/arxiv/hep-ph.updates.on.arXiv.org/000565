The Glashow-Salam-Weinberg model for N=2 generations is extended to 8 composite Higgs multiplets
by using a one-to-one correspondence between its complex Higgs doublet and very specific quadruplets
of bilinear quark operators. This is the minimal number required to suitably account, simultaneously,
for the pseudoscalar mesons that can be built with 4 quarks and for the masses of the $W$ gauge bosons.
They are used as input, together with elementary low energy considerations, from which all other
parameters, masses and couplings can be calculated. We focus in this work on the spectrum of the 8
Higgs bosons, on the mixing angles, and on the set of "horizontal" and "vertical" entangled symmetries
that, within the chiral $U(4)_L \times U(4)_R$ group, strongly frame this extension of the Standard
Model. In particular, the $u-c$ ($\theta_u$) and $d-s$ ($\theta_d$) mixing angles satisfy the
robust relation $\tan(\theta_d+\theta_u)\tan(\theta_d-\theta_u) = \Big(\frac{1}{m_{K^\pm}^2}-\frac{1}{m_{D^\pm}^2}\Big)
\big/ \Big(\frac{1}{m_{\pi^\pm}^2}-\frac{1}{m_{D_s^\pm}^2}\Big)$. Light scalars (below
$90 MeV$) arise and the mass of (at least) one of the Higgs bosons grows like that of the heaviest $\bar
q\gamma_5 q$ bound state. $\theta_u$ cannot be safely tuned to zero and several parameters have
no reliable expansion in terms of "small" parameters like $m_\pi$ or the mixing angles. This study
does not call for extra species of fermions. The effective couplings of scalars, which depend on
the non-trivial normalization of their kinetic terms, can be extremely weak. For the sake of (relative)
brevity, their rich content of non-standard physics (including astrophysics), the inclusion
of the 3rd generation and the taming of quantum corrections are left for a subsequent work.
