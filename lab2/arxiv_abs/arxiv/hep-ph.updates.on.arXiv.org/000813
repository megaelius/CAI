We propose a neutrino mass model with $\mu\tau$-flavored CP symmetry, where the effective light
neutrino Lagrangian enjoys an additional invariance under a Friedberg-Lee (FL) transformation
on the left-handed flavor neutrino fields, that leads to a highly predictive and testable scenario.
While both types of the light neutrino mass ordering, i.e., Normal Ordering (NO) as well as the Inverted
Ordering (IO) are allowed, the absolute scale of neutrino masses is fixed by the vanishing determinant
of light Majorana neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$. We show that for both types of mass ordering, whilst
the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ is in general nonmaximal ($\theta_{23}\neq \pi/4$),
the Dirac CP phase $\delta$ is exactly maximal ($\delta=\pi/2,3\pi/2$) for IO and nearly maximal
for NO owing to $\cos\delta\propto \sin\theta_{13}$. For the NO, very tiny nonvanishing Majorana
CP violation might appear through one of the Majorana phases $\beta$; otherwise the model predicts
vanishing Majorana CP violation. Thus, despite the fact, that from the measurement of $\theta_{23}$,
it is difficult to rule out the model, any large deviation of $\delta$ from its maximality, will surely
falsify the scenario. For a comprehensive numerical analysis, beside fitting the neutrino oscillation
global fit data, we also present a study on the $\nu_\mu\rightarrow \nu_e$ oscillation which is
expected to show up Dirac CP violation in different long baseline experiments. Finally, assuming
purely astrophysical sources, we calculate the Ultra High Energy (UHE) neutrino flavor flux ratios
at neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube, from which statements on the octant of $\theta_{23}$ could
be made in our model.
