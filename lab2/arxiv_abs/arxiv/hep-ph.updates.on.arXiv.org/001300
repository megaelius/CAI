In this work we study the phenomenology of the process $pp\to W^+W^-jj$ at the LHC, in the scenario
of the resonant vector boson scattering subprocess $W^+W^-\to W^+W^-$ which we describe within
the effective field theory framework of the Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian. We assume a strongly
interacting electroweak symmetry breaking sector in which dynamically generated resonances
with masses in the TeV scale appear as poles in the Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian amplitudes unitarized
with the Inverse Amplitude Method. The relevant resonance here, $V_0$, is the neutral component
of the triplet of vector resonances which are known to emerge dynamically at the TeV scale for specific
values of the Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian parameters. With the aim of studying the production
and possible observation of $V^0$ at the LHC, via the resonant $W^+W^-\to W^+W^-$ scattering, a
MadGraph~5 UFO model has been developed employing a phenomenological Proca Lagrangian as a practical
tool to mimic the correct $V^0$ properties that are predicted with the Inverse Amplitude Method.
We choose to study the fully hadronic decay channel of the final gauge bosons $W W\to J(jj)J(jj)$
since it leads to larger event rates and because in the alternative leptonic decay channels the presence
of neutrinos complicates the reconstruction of the resonance properties. In this context, the
2 boosted jets from the $W$ hadronic decays, $jj$, are detected as a single fat jet, $J$, due to their
extreme collinearity. We perform a dedicated analysis of the sensitivity to these vector resonances
$V^0$ with masses between 1.5 and 2.5 TeV at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and the planned high luminosity
of 3000 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$, paying special attention to the study of efficient cuts to extract the resonant
vector boson fusion signal from the QCD background, which clearly represents the main challenge
of this search.
