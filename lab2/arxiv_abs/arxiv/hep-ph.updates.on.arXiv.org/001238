We present cosmological parameter measurements from the publicly available Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data on anisotropic galaxy clustering in Fourier space. Compared
to previous studies, our analysis has two main novel features. First, we use a complete perturbation
theory model that properly takes into account the non-linear effects of dark matter clustering,
short-scale physics, galaxy bias, redshift-space distortions, and large-scale bulk flows. Second,
we employ a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo technique and consistently reevaluate the full power spectrum
likelihood as we scan over different cosmologies. Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with
massive neutrinos, fixing the primordial power spectrum tilt, and imposing the big bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN) prior on the physical baryon density $\omega_b$, we find the following late-Universe parameters:
Hubble constant $H_0=(67.89\pm 1.06)$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, matter density fraction $\Omega_m=0.295\pm
0.010$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8=0.721\pm 0.043$. These parameters were
measured directly from the BOSS data and independently of the Planck cosmic microwave background
observations. Our constraints remain unchanged if we replace the BBN prior on $\omega_b$ by a tighter
Planck constraint. Finally, we discuss the information content of the BOSS power spectrum and show
that it is dominated by the location of the baryon acoustic oscillations and the power spectrum shape.
We argue that the contribution of the Alcock-Paczynski effect is marginal in $\Lambda$CDM, but
becomes important for non-minimal cosmological models.
