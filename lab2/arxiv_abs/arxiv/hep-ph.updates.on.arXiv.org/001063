The Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies are the closest Local Group galaxies to the Milky
Way, being only 785 and 870 kpc away. These two galaxies provide an independent view of high-energy
processes that are often obscured in our own Galaxy, including possible signals of dark matter (DM)
particle interactions. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) preliminary eight year list
of sources includes both M31, which is detected as extended with a size of about 0.4$^\circ$, and
M33, which is detected as a point-like source. The spatial morphology of M31 $\gamma$-ray emission
could trace a population of unresolved sources and energetic particles originating in sources
not related to massive star formation. Alternatively, the $\gamma$-ray emission could also be
an indication of annihilation or decay of DM particles. We investigate these two possibilities
using almost 10 years of data from the Fermi LAT. An interpretation that involves only a DM $\gamma$-ray
emission is in tension with the current limits from other searches, such as those targeting Milky
Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. When we include a template of astrophysical emission, tuned on $\gamma$-ray
data or from observations of these galaxies in other wavelengths, we do not find any significant
evidence for a DM contribution and we set limits for the annihilation cross section that probe the
thermal cross section for DM masses up to a few tens of GeV in the $b\bar{b}$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ channels.
For models where the DM substructures have masses above $10^{-6}$ solar masses our limits probe
the DM interpretation of the Fermi LAT Galactic center excess. We provide also the lower limit for
the DM decay time assuming the same spatial models of the DM distribution in M31 and M33.
