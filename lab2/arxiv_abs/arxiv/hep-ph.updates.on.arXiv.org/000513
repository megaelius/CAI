We derive a mean-field relativistic formula for the isotope shift of an electronic energy level
for arbitrary angular momentum; we then use it to predict the spectra of superheavy metastable neutron-rich
isotopes belonging to the hypothetical island of stability. Our results may be applied to the search
for superheavy atoms in astrophysical spectra using the known values of the transition frequencies
for the neutron deficient isotopes produced in the laboratory. An example of a relevant astrophysical
system may be the spectra of the Przybylski's star where superheavy elements up to Z=99 have been
possibly identified. In addition, it has been recently suggested to use the measurements of King
plot non-linearity in a search for hypothetical new light bosons. On the other hand, one can find
the non-linear corrections to the King-plot arising already in the Standard Model framework. We
investigate contributions to the non-linearity arising from relativistic effects in the isotope
field-shift, the nuclear polarizability and many-body effects. It is found that the nuclear polarizability
contribution can lead to the significant deviation of the King plot from linearity. Therefore,
the measurements of the non-linearity of King plots may be applied to obtain the nuclear polarizability
change between individual isotopes. We then proceed with providing a rough analytical estimate
of the non-linearity arising solely from the effect of a hypothetical scalar boson. Our predictions
give theoretical limitations on the sensitivity of the search for new interactions and should help
to identify the most suitable atoms for corresponding experiments.
