Forward amplitude analyses constitute an important approach in the investigation of the energy
dependence of the total hadronic cross-section $\sigma_{tot}$ and the $\rho$ parameter. The standard
picture indicates for $\sigma_{tot}$ a leading log-squared dependence at the highest c.m. energies,
in accordance with the Froissart-Lukaszuk-Martin bound. Beyond this log-squared (L2) leading
dependence, other amplitude analyses have considered a log-raised-to-gamma form (L$\gamma$),
with $\gamma$ as a real free fit parameter. In this case, analytic connections with $\rho$ can be
obtained either through dispersion relations (derivative forms), or asymptotic uniqueness (Phragm\'en-Lindel\"off
theorems). In this work we present a detailed discussion on the similarities and mainly the differences
between the Derivative Dispersion Relation (DDR) and Asymptotic Uniqueness (AU) approaches and
results, with focus on the L$\gamma$ and L2 leading terms. We also develop new Regge-Gribov fits
with updated dataset on $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ from $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ scattering, in the region
5 GeV-8 TeV. The recent tension between the TOTEM and ATLAS results at 7 TeV and mainly 8 TeV is considered
in the data reductions. Our main conclusions are: (1) all fit results present agreement with the
experimental data analyzed and the goodness-of-fit is slightly better in case of the DDR approach;
(2) by considering only the TOTEM data at the LHC region, the fits with L$\gamma$ indicate $\gamma\sim
2.0\pm 0.2$ (AU) and $\gamma\sim 2.3\pm 0.1$ (DDR); (3) by including the ATLAS data the fits provide
$\gamma\sim 1.9\pm 0.1$ (AU) and $\gamma\sim 2.2\pm 0.2$ (DDR); (4) in the formal and practical
contexts, the DDR approach is more adequate for the energy interval investigated than the AU approach.
A review on the analytic results for $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ from the Regge-Gribov, DDR and AU
approaches is presented.
