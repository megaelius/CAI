In this work, we systemically investigate the molecular states from the $\Sigma^{(*)}_c\bar{D}^{(*)}-\Lambda_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$
interaction with the help of the Lagrangians with heavy quark and chiral symmetries in a quasipotential
Bethe-Salpeter equation (qBSE) approach. The molecular states from isodoublet (I=1/2) $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$
interaction with spin parity $J^P=1/2^-$ and $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^*$ interaction with $1/2^-$ and
$ 3/2^-$ are produced from the interaction, and the masses and widths of these three states are consistent
with the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ observed at LHCb. The states $\Sigma_c^*\bar{D}^*(1/2^-)$,
$\Sigma_c^*\bar{D}^*(3/2^-)$, and the $\Sigma^*_c\bar{D}(3/2^-)$ are also produced with the
same parameters. The isodoublet $\Sigma_c^*\bar{D}^*$ interaction with $5/2^-$, as well as the
isoquartet (I=3/2) $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^*$ interactions with $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$, $\Sigma_c^*\bar{D}^*$
interaction with $3/2^-$ and $5/2^-$, are also attractive while very large cutoffs are required
to produce a molecular state. We also investigate the origin of the widths of these molecular states
in the same model. The $\Lambda\bar{D}^*$ channel is dominant in the decays of the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^*(1/2^-)$,
$\Sigma_c\bar{D}^*(3/2^-)$, $\Sigma_c^*\bar{D}(3/2^-)$, and $\Sigma_c\bar{D}(1/2^-)$.
The $\Sigma^*_c\bar{D}^*(1/2^-)$ state has large couplings to $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$ channel while
the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^*$, $\Sigma^*_c\bar{D}$ and $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^*$ channels provide similar
contributions to the width of the $\Sigma^*_c\bar{D}^*(3/2^-)$ state. These results will be helpful
to understand the current LHCb experimental results, and the three predicted states and the decay
pattern of these hidden-charmed molecular pentaquarks can be checked in the future experiments.
