We present a new calculation of the energy distribution of high-energy neutrinos from the decay
of charm and bottom hadrons produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the kinematical region
of very forward rapidities, heavy-flavor production and decay is a source of tau neutrinos that
leads to thousands of { charged-current} tau neutrino events in a 1 m long, 1 m radius lead neutrino
detector at a distance of 480 m from the interaction region. In our computation, next-to-leading
order QCD radiative corrections are accounted for in the production cross-sections. Non-perturbative
intrinsic-$k_T$ effects are approximated by a simple phenomenological model introducing a Gaussian
$k_T$-smearing of the parton distribution functions, which might also mimic perturbative effects
due to multiple initial-state soft-gluon emissions. The transition from partonic to hadronic
states is described by phenomenological fragmentation functions. To study the effect of various
input parameters, theoretical predictions for $D_s^\pm$ production are compared with LHCb data
on double-differential cross-sections in transverse momentum and rapidity. The uncertainties
related to the choice of the input parameter values, ultimately affecting the predictions of the
tau neutrino event distributions, are discussed. We consider a 3+1 neutrino mixing scenario to
illustrate the potential for a neutrino experiment to constrain the 3+1 parameter space using tau
neutrinos and antineutrinos. We find large theoretical uncertainties in the predictions of the
neutrino fluxes in the far-forward region. Untangling the effects of tau neutrino oscillations
into sterile neutrinos and distinguishing a 3+1 scenario from the standard scenario with three
active neutrino flavours, will be challenging due to the large theoretical uncertainties from
QCD.
