Assuming for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) a Maxwellian velocity distribution
in the Galaxy we explore in a systematic way the relative sensitivity of an extensive set of existing
and projected Dark Matter (DM) direct detection experiments to each of the 14 couplings that parameterize
the most general non-relativistic (NR) effective Hamiltonian allowed by Galilean invariance
for a contact interaction driving the elastic scattering off nuclei of WIMPs of spin 1/2. We perform
our analysis in terms of two free parameters: the WIMP mass $m_{\chi}$ and the ratio between the WIMP-neutron
and the WIMP-proton couplings $c^n/c^p$. We include the modified signal spectral shape due to non-standard
interactions when it is needed in the determination of the bound, such as in the case of background
subtraction or of the application of the optimal-interval method. For each coupling, in the $m_{\chi}$-$c^n/c^p$
plane we provide contour plots of the most stringent 90 % C.L. bound on the WIMP-nucleon cross section
and show the experiment providing it. We also introduce NRDD_constraints, a simple interpolating
code written in Python that allows to obtain the numerical value of the bound as a function of the WIMP
mass $m_{\chi}$ and of the coupling ratio $c^n/c^p$ for each NR coupling. We find that 9 experiments
out of the 14 present Dark Matter searches considered in our analysis provide the most stringent
bound on some of the effective couplings for a given choice of $(m_{\chi},c^n/c^p)$: this is evidence
of the complementarity of different target nuclei and/or different combinations of count-rates
and energy thresholds when the search of DM is extended to a wide range of possible interactions.
