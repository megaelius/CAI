In this work, an independent and detailed statistical analysis of the double-Chooz experiment
is performed. To have a thorough understanding of the implications of the double-Chooz data on both
oscillation parameters $\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$, we decided to analyze
the data corresponding to the Far detector, with no additional restriction. By doing this, confidence
regions and best fit values are obtained for ($\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13}),\Delta m^2_{31}$). This
analysis yields an out-of-order $\Delta m^2_{31}$ minimum, which has already been mentioned in
previous works, and it is corrected with the inclusion of additional restrictions. With such restrictions
it is obtained that $\sin ^{2}(2 \theta _{13})=0{.}084_{-0{.}028}^{+0{.}030}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}=2.444^{+0.187}_{-0.215}
\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$/c$^4$. Our analysis allows us to study the effects of the so called "spectral
bump" around 5 MeV, it is observed that a variation of this spectral bump may be able to move the $\Delta
m^2_{31}$ best fit value, in such a way that $\Delta m^2_{31}$ takes the order of magnitude of the
MINOS value. Finally, and with the intention of understanding the effects of the preliminary Near
detector data, we performed two different analyses, aiming to eliminate the effects of the energy
bump. As a consequence, it is found that unlike the Far Detector analysis, the Near detector data
may be able to fully determine both oscillation parameters by itself, resulting in, $\sin^2(2\theta_{13})
= 0.095 \pm 0.053$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{31} = 2.63^{+0.98}_{-1.15} \times 10^{-3} \text{eV}^2 /
\text{c}^4$. The later analyses represent an improvement with respect to previous works, where
additional constraints for $\Delta m^2_{31}$ were necessary.
