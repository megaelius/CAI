Pulsar timing and gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are superb laboratories to study gravity
theories in the strong-field regime. Here we combine those tools to test the mono-scalar-tensor
theory of Damour and Esposito-Far{\`e}se (DEF), which predicts nonperturbative scalarization
phenomena for neutron stars (NSs). First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use
the absence of dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems composed
of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for NSs, to derive the most stringent
constraints on the two free parameters of the DEF scalar-tensor theory. Since the binary-pulsar
bounds depend on the NS mass and the EOS, we find that current pulsar-timing observations leave scalarization
windows, i.e., regions of parameter space where scalarization can still be prominent. Then, we
investigate if these scalarization windows could be closed and if pulsar-timing constraints could
be improved by laser-interferometer GW detectors, when spontaneous (or dynamical) scalarization
sets in during the early (or late) stages of a binary NS (BNS) evolution. For the early inspiral of
a BNS carrying constant scalar charge, we employ a Fisher matrix analysis to show that Advanced LIGO
can improve pulsar-timing constraints for some EOSs, and next-generation detectors, such as the
Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, will be able to improve those bounds for all eleven EOSs.
Using the late inspiral of a BNS, we estimate that for some of the EOSs under consideration the onset
of dynamical scalarization can happen early enough to improve the constraints on the DEF parameters
obtained by combining the five binary pulsars. Thus, in the near future the complementarity of pulsar
timing and direct observations of GWs on the ground will be extremely valuable in probing gravity
theories in the strong-field regime.
