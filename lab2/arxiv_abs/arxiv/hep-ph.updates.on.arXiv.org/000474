In this paper, we propose a $G_{L-R}\times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge-symmetric model where
$G_{L-R}$ is the left-right gauge symmetry and $L_i$ is the $i-$flavor lepton number. We use the
spontaneous breaking (SSB) of $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ to explain two discrepancies in the standard
model: muon anomalous magnetic moment and light neutrinos and its oscillations. The massive neutral
gauge boson, $Z_{\mu\tau}$, arising from the SSB can provide additional contributions to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment. In order to explain neutrino masses, we employ the low-energy inverse
seesaw mechanism by adding three $G_{L-R}$ singlet fermions, $S_{e,\mu,\tau}$. The light neutrino
mass matrix from the inverse seesaw formula has a specific two-zero texture pattern referred in
the literature as the Type-C two-zero texture due to the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry. This
allows us to predict the values of the CP-violating Dirac phase, Majorana phases, and the absolute
value of light neutrino masses in terms of the precisely measured mixing angles and mass squared
differences. The model accommodates a quasi-degenerate spectrum of neutrino masses with inverted
ordering. The calculated best-fit value of $\delta_{CP}$ surprisingly matches with the current
experimentally measured best-fit value of $\delta_{CP}$. At $1\sigma$, the measured value of
$\delta_{CP}$ favors a $\theta_{23}>\pi/4$. At $1\sigma$, most of the parameter space is within
the cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino mass and the bound on the effective Majorana mass from
neutrinoless beta decay. We compare and contrast the results with those from the type-I $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$
model which accommodates Type-C two-zero minor texture.
