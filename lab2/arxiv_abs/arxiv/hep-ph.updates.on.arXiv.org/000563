The cold dark matter fermions with mass MeV scale, pair produced inside the supernova SN1987A core,
can freely stream away from the supernovae and hence contributes to its energy loss rate. Similar
type of DM fermions(having similar kind of coupling to the standard model photon), produced from
some other sources earlier, could have contributed to the relic density of the Universe. Working
in a theory with an effective dark matter-photon coupling (inversely proportional to the scale
$\Lambda$) in the formalism of Tsallis statistics, we find the dark matter contribution to the relic
density and obtain a upper bound on $\Lda$ using the experimental bound on the relic density for cold
non-baryonic matter i.e. $\Omega h^2 = 0.1186 \pm 0.0020 $. The upper bound obtained from the relic
density is shown with the lower bound obtained from the Raffelt's criterion on the emissibity rate
of the supernovae SN1987A energy loss $\dot{\varepsilon}(e^+ e^- \to \chi \overline{\chi}) \le
10^{19}~\rm{erg~g^{-1}s^{-1}}$ and the optical depth criteria on the free streaming of the dark
matter fermion (produced inside the supernovae core). As the deformation parameter $q$ changes
from $1.0$ (undeformed scenario) to $1.1$(deformed scenario), the relic density bound on $\Lda$
is found to vary from $ \sim 4.9 \times 10^7 $ TeV to $1.6 \times 10^8$ TeV for a fermion dark matter($\chi$)
of mass $m_\chi = 30~\rm{MeV}$, which is almost $10$ times more than the lower bound obtained from
the SN1987A energy loss rate and the optical depth criteria. %for light fermion dark matter of mass
$m_{\chi}=10 \mbox{-} 30$ MeV. {{\bf Keywords}: Dark matter, Relic density, Supernova cooling,
