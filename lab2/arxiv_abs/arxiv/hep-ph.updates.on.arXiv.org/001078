Previous studies have shown that the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Model, supplied with appropriate
symmetry breaking, provides an Effective Lagrangian (BHLS) able to encompass a large number of
processes within a unified framework. A global fit procedure provides a simultaneous description
of the $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into 6 final states ($\pi^+\pi^-$, $\pi^0\gamma$, $\eta \gamma$,
$\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$, $K^+K^-$, $K_L K_S$), the dipion spectrum in the $\tau$ decay and other light
meson partial widths. Additional breaking schemes are defined which extend its scope so as to absorb
spacelike processes within a new framework (BHLS$_2$). The phenomenology previously explored
with BHLS is revisited in the BHLS$_2$ context with emphasis on the $\Phi$ mass region. It is shown
that BHLS$_2$ addresses the close spacelike region covered by NA7 and Fermilab data; it is also shown
that recent Lattice QCD pion form factor information is accurately predicted by BHLS$_2$ using
fits to annihilation data only. The contribution to $a_\mu$ of these channels over the range of validity
of BHLS$_2$ is shown to strongly reduce the former BHLS systematics. The uncertainty on $a_\mu^{\rm
th}(\sqrt{s}< 1.05$ GeV) is much improved compared to standard approaches relying on direct integration
methods of measured spectra. Using the BHLS$_2$ results, the leading order HVP contribution to
the muon anomalous moment is $a_\mu^{HVP-LO}= 687.11 \pm 3.01 +(+0.86,-0.62)_{syst.}$ in units
of $10^{-10}$. Using a conservative estimate for the light--by--light contribution, our evaluation
for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is $a_\mu^{\rm th}=\left [11\,659\,176.42 \pm 4.17 +(+1.26,-1.02)_{syst.}\right]
\times 10^{-10}$. The difference $a_\mu^{\rm th}-a_\mu^{\rm BNL}$ exhibits a significance not
smaller than $4.2 \sigma$.
