Massive neutrinos demand to ask whether they are Dirac or Majorana particles. Majorana neutrinos
are an irrefutable proof of physics beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinoless double electron capture
is not a process but a virtual $\Delta L = 2$ mixing between a parent $^AZ$ atom and a daughter $^A(Z-2)$
excited atom with two electron holes. As a mixing between two neutral atoms and the observable signal
in terms of emitted two-hole X-rays, the strategy, experimental signature and background are different
from neutrinoless double beta decay. The mixing is resonantly enhanced for almost degeneracy and,
under these conditions, there is no irreducible background from the standard two-neutrino channel.
We reconstruct the natural time history of a nominally stable parent atom since its production either
by nature or in the laboratory. After the time periods of atom oscillations and the decay of the short-lived
daughter atom, at observable times the relevant "stationary" states are the mixed metastable long-lived
state and the non-orthogonal short-lived excited state, as well as the ground state of the daughter
atom. We find that they have a natural population inversion which is most appropriate for exploiting
the bosonic nature of the observed atomic transitions radiation. Among different observables
of the atom Majorana mixing, we include the enhanced rate of stimulated X-ray emission from the long-lived
metastable state by a high-intensity X-ray beam: a gain factor of 100 can be envisaged at current
XFEL facilities. On the other hand, the historical population of the daughter atom ground state
can be probed by exciting it with a current pulsed optical laser, showing the characteristic absorption
lines: the whole population can be excited in a shorter time than typical pulse duration.
