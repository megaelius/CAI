The centrality or the number of initial-state sources $V$ of the system produced in heavy ion collision
is a concept that is not uniquely defined and subject to significant theoretical and experimental
uncertainties. We argue that a more robust connection between the initial-state sources with final-state
multiplicity could be established from the event-by-event multiplicity correlation between
two subevents separated in pseudorapidity, $N_a$ vs $N_b$. This correlation is sensitive to two
main types of centrality fluctuations (CF): 1) particle production for each source $p(n)$ which
smears the relation between $V$ and $N_a$ used for experimental centrality, and 2) decorrelations
between the sources in the two subevents $V_b$ and $V_a$. The CF is analyzed in terms of cumulants
of $V_b$ and $N_b$ as a function of $N_a$, i.e. experimental centrality is defined with $N_a$. We
found that the mean values $\langle V_b\rangle_{N_a}$ and $\langle N_b\rangle_{N_a}$ increase
linearly with $N_a$ in mid-central collisions, but flatten out in ultra-central collisions. Such
non-linear behavior is sensitive to the centrality resolution of $N_a$. In the presence of centrality
decorrelations, the scaled variances $\langle(\delta V_b)^2\rangle/\langle V_b\rangle$ and
$\langle(\delta N_b)^2\rangle/\langle N_b\rangle$ are found to decrease linearly with $N_a$
in mid-central collisions, while the $p(n)$ leads to another sharp decrease in the ultra-central
region. The higher-order cumulants of $V_b$ and $N_b$ show interesting but rather complex behaviors
which deserve further studies. Our results suggest that one can use the cumulants of the two-dimensional
multiplicity correlation, especially the mean and variance, to constrain the particle production
mechanism as well as the longitudinal fluctuations of the initial-state sources.
