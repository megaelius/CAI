It is well understood that the leading logarithmic approximation for the amplitudes of high energy
processes is insufficient and that the next-to-leading logarithmic effects are very large and
lead to instability of the solution. The resummation at low $x$, which includes kinematical constraints
and other corrections leads to stable result. Using previously established resummation procedure
we study in detail the preasymptotic effects which occur in the solution to the resummed BFKL equation
when the energy is not very large. We find that in addition to the well known reduction of the intercept,
which governs the energy dependence of the gluon Green's function, resummation leads to the delay
of the onset of its small $x$ growth. Moreover the gluon Green's function develops a dip or a plateau
in wide range of rapidities, which increases for large scales. The preasymptotic region in the gluon
Green's function extends to about $8$ units in rapidity for the transverse scales of the order of
$30-100 \; {\rm GeV} $. To visualize the expected behavior of physical processes with two equal hard
scales we calculate the cross section of the process $\gamma^{*}+\gamma^{*}\to X$ to be probed
at future very high-energy electron-positron colliders. We find that at $\gamma^*\gamma^*$ energies
below $100 \; \rm GeV$ the BFKL Pomeron leads to smaller value of the cross section than the Born approximation,
and only starts to dominate at energies about $100 \; \rm GeV$. This pattern is significantly different
from the one which we find using LL approximation. We also analyze the transverse momentum contributions
to the cross section for different virtualities of the photons and find that the dominant contributions
to the integral over the transverse momenta comes from lower values than the the external scales
in the process under consideration.
