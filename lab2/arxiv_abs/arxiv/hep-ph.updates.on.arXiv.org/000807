We present a lattice calculation of the leading Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution
of the light u- and d-quarks to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(ud)$,
adopting the gauge configurations generated by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration with $N_f
= 2+1+1$ dynamical quarks at three values of the lattice spacing with pion masses in the range 210
- 450 MeV. Thanks to several lattices at fixed values of the light-quark mass and scale but with different
sizes we perform a careful investigation of finite-volume effects (FVEs). In order to remove FVEs
we develop an analytic representation of the vector correlator, which describes the lattice data
for time distances larger than $\simeq 0.2$ fm. The representation is based on quark-hadron duality
at small and intermediate time distances and on the two-pion contributions in a finite box at larger
time distances. After extrapolation to the physical pion point and to the continuum limit we obtain
$a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(ud) = 619.0~(17.8) \cdot 10^{-10}$. Adding the contribution of strange and charm
quarks, obtained by ETMC, and an estimate of the isospin-breaking corrections and quark-disconnected
diagrams from the literature we get $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(udsc) = 683~(19) \cdot 10^{-10}$, which is
consistent with recent results based on dispersive analyses of the experimental cross section
data for $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadrons. Using our analytic representation of the vector correlator,
taken at the physical pion mass in the continuum and infinite volume limits, we provide the first
eleven moments of the polarization function and we compare them with recent results of the dispersive
analysis of the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ channels. We estimate also the light-quark contribution to the missing
part of $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}$ not covered in the MUonE experiment.
