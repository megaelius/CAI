The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) contains a singlet-like pseudoscalar
Higgs boson in addition to the doublet-like pseudoscalar of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model. This new pseudoscalar can have a very low mass without violating the LEP exclusion constraints
and it can potentially provide a hallmark signature of non-minimal supersymmetry at the LHC. In
this analysis we revisit the light pseudoscalar in the NMSSM with partial universality at some high
unification scale. We delineate the regions of the model's parameter space that are consistent
with the up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints, from both Higgs boson searches
and elsewhere (most notably $b$-physics), and examine to what extent they can be probed by the LHC.
To this end we review the most important production channels of such a Higgs state and assess the scope
of its observation at the forthcoming Run-2 of the LHC. We conclude that the $b\bar{b}$-associated
production of the pseudoscalar, which has been emphasised in previous studies, does not carry much
promise anymore, given the measured mass of the Higgs boson at the LHC. However, the decays of one
of the heavier scalar Higgsbosons of the NMSSM can potentially lead to the discovery of its light
pseudoscalar. Especially promising are the decays of one or both of the two lightest scalar states
into a pseudoscalar pair and of the heaviest scalar into a pseudoscalar and a $Z$ boson. Since the
latter channel has not been explored in detail in the literature so far, we provide details of some
benchmark points which can be probed for establishing its signature.
