We extend the investigation of the structure of the late-time wavefunction of the universe to a class
of toy models of scalars with time-dependent masses and polynomial couplings, which contains general
massive scalars in FRW cosmologies. We associate a universal integrand to each Feynman diagram
contributing to the wavefunction of the universe. For certain (light) masses, such an integrand
satisfies recursion relations involving differential operators, connecting states with different
masses and having, as a seed, the massless scalar (which describes a conformally coupled scalar
as a special case). We show that it is a degenerate limit of the canonical form of a generalisation
of the cosmological polytopes describing the wavefunction for massless scalars. Intriguingly,
the flat-space scattering amplitude appears as a higher codimension face: it is encoding the leading
term in the Laurent expansion as the total energy is taken to zero, with the codimension of the face
providing the order of the total energy pole. The same connection between the other faces and the
Laurent expansion coefficients holds for the other singularities of the wavefunction of the universe,
all of them connectable to flat-space processes. As the degenerate limit is taken, some of the singularities
of the canonical form of the polytope collapse onto each other generating higher order poles. Finally,
we consider the mass as a perturbative coupling, showing that the contribution to the wavefunction
coming from graphs with mass two-point couplings can be identified with a degenerate limit of the
canonical form of the cosmological polytope, if the perturbative expansion is done around the conformally
coupled state; or as double degenerate limit of the canonical form of the extension of the cosmological
polytopes introduced in the present paper, if the perturbative expansion is done around minimally
coupled states.
