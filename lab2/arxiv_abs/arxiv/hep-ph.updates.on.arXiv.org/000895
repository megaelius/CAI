Colored and colorless particles that are stable on collider scales and carry exotic electric charges,
so-called multiply-charged heavy stable particles (MCHSPs), exist in extensions of the Standard
Model, and can include the top partner(s) in solutions of the hierarchy problem. To obtain bounds
on color-triplets and color-singlets of charges up to |Q|=8, we recast searches for signatures
of two production channels: the "open" channel - where the particles are pair-produced above threshold,
and are detectable in dedicated LHC searches for stable multiply charged leptons, and the "closed"
channel - where a particle-antiparticle pair is produced as a bound state, detectable in searches
for a diphoton resonance. We recast the open lepton searches by incorporating the relevant strong-interaction
effects for color-triplets. In both open and closed production, we provide a careful assessment
of photon-induced processes using the accurate LUXqed PDF, resulting in substantially weaker
bounds than previously claimed in the literature for the colorless case. Our bounds for colored
MCHSPs are shown for the first time, as the LHC experiments have not searched for them directly. Generally,
we obtain nearly charge-independent lower mass limits of around 970 GeV (color-triplet scalar),
1200 GeV (color-triplet fermion), and 880 - 900 GeV (color-singlet fermion) from open production,
and strongly charge-dependent limits from closed production. In all cases there is a crossover
between dominance by open and closed searches at some charge. We provide prospective bounds for
$\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV LHC searches at integrated luminosities of 39.5 fb${}^{-1}$, 100 fb${}^{-1}$,
and 300 fb${}^{-1}$. Moreover, we show that a joint observation in the open and the closed channels
allows to determine the mass, spin, color, and electric charge of the particle.
