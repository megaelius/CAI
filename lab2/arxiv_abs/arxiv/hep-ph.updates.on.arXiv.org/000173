We extend the Standard Model (SM) by adding a pair of fermionic SU(2)-doublets with opposite hypercharge
and a fermionic SU(2)-triplet with zero hypercharge. We impose a discrete Z_2-symmetry that distinguishes
the SM fermions from the new ones. Then, gauge invariance allows for two renormalizable Yukawa couplings
between the new fermions and the SM Higgs field, as well as for direct masses for the doublet (M_D)
and the triplet (M_T). After electroweak symmetry breaking, this model contains, in addition to
SM particles, two charged Dirac fermions and a set of three neutral Majorana fermions, the lightest
of which contributes to Dark Matter (DM). We consider a case where the lightest neutral fermion is
an equal admixture of the two doublets with mass M_D close to the Z-boson mass. This state remains
stable under radiative corrections thanks to a custodial SU(2)-symmetry and is consistent with
the experimental data from oblique electroweak corrections. Moreover, the amplitudes relevant
to spin-dependent or independent nucleus-DM particle scattering cross section both vanish at
tree level. They arise at one loop at a level that may be observed in near future DM direct detection
experiments. For Yukawa couplings comparable to the top-quark, the DM particle relic abundance
is consistent with observation, not relying on co-annihilation or resonant effects and has a mass
at the electroweak scale. Furthermore, the heavier fermions decay to the DM particle and to electroweak
gauge bosons making this model easily testable at the LHC. In the regime of interest, the charged
fermions suppress the Higgs decays to diphoton by 45-75 % relative to SM prediction.
