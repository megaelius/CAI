In many extensions of the Standard Model flavour changing neutral current processes can be mediated
by tree-level heavy neutral scalars and/or pseudo-scalars H^0(A^0). This generally introduces
new sources of flavour violation and CP violation as well as left-handed and right-handed scalar
currents. These new physics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM expectations for
FCNC processes that depends only on the couplings of H^0(A^0) to fermions and on their masses. In
situations in which a single H^0 or A^0 dominates NP contributions stringent correlations between
Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 observables exist. Anticipating the Flavour Precision Era ahead of us we
illustrate this by searching for allowed oases in the landscape of a given model assuming significantly
smaller uncertainties in CKM and hadronic parameters than presently available. To this end we analyze
Delta F=2 observables in B^0_{s,d}-bar B^0_{s,d} and K^0-bar K^0 systems and rare B and K decays
with charged leptons in the final state including both left-handed and right-handed scalar couplings
of H^0 and A^0 to quarks in various combinations. We identify a number of correlations between various
flavour observables that could test and distinguish these different scenarios. The prominent
role of the decays B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- in these studies is emphasized. Imposing the existing
flavour constraints, a rich pattern of deviations from the SM expectations in rare B_{s,d} decays
emerges provided M_H< 1 TeV. NP effects in rare K decays are very small. Neutral SM Higgs contributions
to rare B and K decays turn out to be negligible once the constraints from Delta F=2 processes are taken
into account. Finally, we point out striking differences between the correlations found here and
in scenarios in which tree-level FCNC are mediated by a new neutral gauge boson Z'.
