We study Dirac fermionic dark matter (DM, $\chi^0$) and confront it with recent data. To evade the
stringent direct search limits from XENON1T, LUX and PandaX-II expreiments, the quantum numbers
of the Dirac DM are taken to be $I_3=Y=0$ to remove the tree-level $Z$-exchange diagram. Loop amplitudes
can contribute to the elastic scattering cross section. We find that there are cancellations in
the one-loop diagrams, which largely reduce the cross section and make the Dirac DM viable in the
direct search. For a generic isospin $I$, we survey the Dirac DM mass constrained by the latest results
of PandaX-II, XENON1T and LUX experiments, the observed DM relic density, and the H.E.S.S. and the
Fermi-LAT astrophysical observations. Sommerfeld enhancement effects on DM annihilation processes
are investigated. We find that the $\chi^0\bar\chi^0$ to the standard model (SM) gauge boson annihilation
cross sections are significantly enhanced and the Fermi-LAT, the H.E.S.S. upper limits on $\langle\sigma
v\rangle({W^+W^-})$ and the observed relic density become serious constraints on the DM mass.
The $I=1$ case is ruled out and Dirac DM masses are forced to be within the ranges of a few to few tens
TeV for $2 \leqslant I \leqslant 4$ and few tens to few hundreds TeV for $I \geqslant 5$, giving $\sigma^{SI}$
around $10^{-46}\sim10^{-45}$ cm$^2$. In most cases for $I \leqslant 5$, $\langle\sigma v\rangle({Z^0Z^0})$
and $\langle\sigma v\rangle({Z^0\gamma})$ are larger than $\langle\sigma v\rangle({W^+W^-})$.
The $\chi^0\bar\chi^0\to Z^0Z^0$ and $ Z^0\gamma$ annihilation processes can be useful in the
search of DM. Our predictions can be verified by the future experiments.
