This is the first paper of our systematic efforts on lepton number violating (LNV) hadronic decays
in the effective field theory approach. These decays provide information complementary to popular
nuclear neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in that they can probe LNV interactions
involving heavier quarks and charged leptons. We may call them hadronic $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays
in short, though $\beta$ refers to all charged leptons. In this work we investigate the decays $K^\pm\rightarrow\pi^\mp
l^{\pm}l^{\pm}$ that arise from short-distance or contact interactions involving four quark
fields and two charged lepton fields, which have canonical dimension nine (dim-9) at leading order
in low energy effective field theory (LEFT). We make a complete analysis on the basis of all dim-9
operators that violate lepton number by two units, and compute their one-loop QCD renormalization
effects. We match these effective interactions in LEFT to those in chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT)
for pseudoscalar mesons, and determine the resulting hadronic low energy constants (LECs) by chiral
symmetry and lattice results in the literature. The obtained decay rate is general in that all physics
at and above the electroweak scale is completely parameterized by the relevant Wilson coefficients
in LEFT and hadronic LECs in $\chi$PT. Assuming the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT)
is the appropriate effective field theory between some new physics scale and the electroweak scale,
we match our LEFT results to SMEFT whose leading effective interactions arise from LNV dim-7 operators.
This connection to SMEFT simplifies significantly the interaction structures entering in the
kaon decays, and we employ the current experimental bounds to set constraints on the relevant Wilson
coefficients in SMEFT.
