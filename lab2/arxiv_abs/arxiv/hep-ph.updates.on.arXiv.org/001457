A system size scan program was recently proposed for the STAR experiments at the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider(RHIC). In this study, we employ a multiphase transport (AMPT) model for considering
the bulk properties at the freeze-out stage for $\mathrm{^{10}B+^{10}B}$, $\mathrm{^{12}C+^{12}C}$,
$\mathrm{^{16}O+^{16}O}$, $\mathrm{^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne}$, $\mathrm{^{40}Ca+^{40}Ca}$, $\mathrm{^{96}Zr+^{96}Zr}$,
and $\mathrm{^{197}Au+^{197}Au}$ collisions at RHIC energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 200, 20, and
7.7 GeV. The results for $\mathrm{^{197}Au+^{197}Au}$ collisions are comparable with those of
previous experimental STAR data. The transverse momentum $p_{T}$ spectra of charged particles
($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$) at the kinetic freeze-out stage, based on a blast-wave
model, are also discussed. In addition, we use a statistical thermal model to extract the parameters
at the chemical freeze-out stage, which agree with those from other thermal model calculations.
It was found that there is a competitive relationship between the kinetic freeze-out parameter
$T_{kin}$ and the radial expansion velocity $\beta_{T}$, which also agrees with the STAR or ALICE
results. We found that the chemical freeze-out strangeness potential $\mu_{s}$ remains constant
in all collision systems and that the fireball radius $R$ is dominated by $\left\langle \mathrm{N_{Part}}\right\rangle$,
which can be well fitted by a function of $a \left\langle \mathrm{N_{Part}}\right\rangle^{b}$
with $b \approx 1/3$. In addition, we calculated the nuclear modification factors for different
collision systems with respect to the $ \mathrm{{}^{10}B} + \mathrm{{}^{10}B}$ system, and found
that they present a gradual suppression within a higher $p_{T}$ range from small to large systems.
