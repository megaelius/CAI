We use ATLAS and CMS searches in the mono-jet + missing energy and mono-photon + missing energy final
state to set limits on the couplings of dark matter to quarks and gluons. Working in an effective field
theory framework we compare several existing mono-jet analyses and find that searches with high
p_T cuts are more sensitive to dark matter. We constrain the suppression scale of the effective dark
matter-Standard Model interactions, and convert these limits into bounds on the cross sections
relevant to direct and indirect detection. We find that, for certain types of operators, in particular
spin-independent dark matter-gluon couplings and spin-dependent dark matter-quark couplings,
LHC constraints from the mono-jet channel are competitive with, or superior to, limits from direct
searches up to dark matter masses of order 1 TeV. Comparing to indirect searches, we exclude, at 90%
C.L., dark matter annihilating to quarks with the annihilation cross section of a thermal relic
for masses below ~ 15-70 GeV, depending on the Lorentz structure of the effective couplings. Mono-photon
limits are somewhat weaker than mono-jet bounds, but still provide an important cross check in the
case of a discovery in mono-jets. We also discuss the possibility that dark matter--Standard Model
interactions at LHC energies cannot be described by effective operators, in which case we find that
constraints can become either significantly stronger, or considerably weaker, depending on the
mass and width of the intermediate particle. We also discuss the special case of dark matter coupling
to the Higgs boson, and we show that searches for invisible Higgs decays would provide superior sensitivity,
particularly for a light Higgs mass and light dark matter.
