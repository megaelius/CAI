We construct an unified model of inflation and PeV dark matter with an appropriate choice of no-scale
K\"ahler potential, superpotential and gauge kinetic function in terms of MSSM fields and hidden
sector Polonyi field. The model is consistent with the CMB observations and can explain the PeV neutrino
flux observed at IceCube HESE. A Starobinsky like Higgs-sneutrino plateau inflation is obtained
from the $D$-term SUGRA potential while $F$-term being subdominant during inflation. To get PeV
dark matter, SUSY breaking at PeV scale is achieved through Polonyi field. This sets the scale for
soft SUSY breaking parameters $m_0, m_{1/2}, A_0 $ at the GUT scale in terms of the parameters of the
model. The low energy particles spectrum is obtained by running the RGEs. We show that the $\sim$125
GeV higgs and the gauge coupling unification can be obtained in this model. The $6$ PeV bino-type
dark matter is a subdominant fraction ($\sim 11\%$) of the relic density and its decay gives the PeV
scale neutrino flux observed at IceCube by appropriately choosing the couplings of the $R$-parity
violating operators. Also we find that there is a degeneracy in scalar field parameters $(\gamma,
\beta)$ and coupling $\zeta$ value in producing the correct amplitude of CMB power spectrum. However
the value of parameter $\tan(\beta)=1.8$, which is tightly fixed from the requirement of PeV scale
SUSY breaking, removes the degeneracy in the values of the scalar field parameters to provide a unique
solution for inflation. In this way it brings the explanation for dark matter, PeV neutrinos and
inflation within the same framework.
