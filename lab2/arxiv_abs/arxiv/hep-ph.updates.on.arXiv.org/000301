We analyzed the nonleptonic decays $B/B_s\to \psi(2S) V $ with $V=(\rho, \omega, K^{*}, \phi)$
by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach. Here the branching ratios, the
$CP$ asymmetries and the complete set of polarization observables are investigated systematically.
Besides the traditional contributions from the factorizable and nonfactorizable diagrams at
the leading order, the next-to-leading order (NLO) vertex corrections could also provide considerable
contributions. The PQCD predictions for the branching ratios of the $B_{(s)}\to \psi(2S)K^{*},
\psi(2S) \phi$ decays are consistent with the measured values within errors. As for $B\to \psi(2S)
\rho, \psi(2S) \omega$ decays, the branching ratios can reach the order of $10^{-5}$ and could be
measured in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The numerical results show that the direct $CP$ asymmetries
of the considered decays are very small. Thus the observation of any large direct $CP$ asymmetry
for these decays will be a signal for new physics. The mixing induced $CP$ asymmetries in the neutral
modes are very close to $\sin 2\beta_{(s)}$, which suggests that these channels can give a cross-check
on the measurement of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) angle $\beta$ and $\beta_s$. We found
that the longitudinal polarization fractions $f_0$ are suppressed to $\sim 50\%$ due to the large
nonfactorizable contributions. The magnitudes and phases of the two transverse amplitudes $\mathcal
{A}_{\parallel}$ and $\mathcal {A}_{\perp}$ are roughly equal, which is an indication for the
approximate light quark helicity conservation in these decays. The overall polarization observables
of $B\to \psi(2S) K^{*0}$ and $B_s\to \psi(2S) \phi$ channels are also in good agreement with the
experimental measurements as reported by LHCb and BaBar. Other results can also be tested by the
LHCb and Belle-II experiments.
