It is very likely that similar to the case of visible matter, dark matter too is composed of more than
one stable component. In this work we investigate a two-component dark matter with one component
from the visible sector and the other from the hidden sector. Specifically we consider a $U(1)_X$
hidden sector extension of MSSM/SUGRA where we allow for kinetic and Stueckelberg mass mixing between
the two abelian $U(1)'s$, i.e., $U(1)_X$ and $U(1)_Y$. We further assume that the hidden sector
has chiral matter which leads to a Dirac fermion as a candidate for dark matter. The lightest neutralino
in the visible sector and the Dirac fermion in the hidden sector then constitute the two components
of dark matter. We investigate in particular MSSM/SUGRA models with radiative breaking occurring
on the hyperbolic branch where the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$ is small (order the electroweak
scale) which leads to a lightest neutralino being dominantly a higgsino. While dark matter constituted
only of higgsinos is significantly constrained by data on dark matter relic density and by limits
on spin independent proton-DM scattering cross section, consistency with data can be achieved
if only a fraction of the dark matter relic density is constituted of higgsinos with the rest coming
from the hidden sector. An aspect of the proposed model is the prediction of a relatively light CP
odd Higgs $A$ (as well as a CP even $H$ and a charged Higgs $H^{\pm}$) which is observable at HL-LHC
and HE-LHC. We perform a detailed collider analysis search for the CP odd Higgs using boosted decision
trees in $\tau_h\tau_h$ final states and compare the discovery potential at HL-LHC and HE-LHC.
We show that while several of the points among our benchmarks may be observable at HL-LHC, all of them
are visible at HE-LHC with much lower integrated luminosities thus reducing significantly the
run time for discovery.
