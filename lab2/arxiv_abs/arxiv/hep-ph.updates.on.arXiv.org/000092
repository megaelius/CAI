It is the goal of this dissertation to demonstrate that beyond the standard model, certain theories
exist which solve conflicts between observation and theory -- conflicts such as massive neutrinos,
dark matter, unstable Higgs vacuum, and recent Planck observations of excess relativistic degrees
of freedom in the early universe. Theories explored include a D-brane inspired construct of U(3)
X Sp(1) X U(1) X U(1) extension of the standard model, in which we demonstrate several possible observables
that may be detected at the LHC, and an ability to stabilize the Higgs mechanism. The extended model
can also explain recent Planck data which, when added to HST data gives an excess of relativistic
degrees of freedom of \Delta N = 0.574 +- 0.25 above the standard result. Also explored is a possible
non-thermal dark matter model for explanation of this result. Recent observations of Fermi bubble
results indicate a signal of a 50 GeV dark matter particle annihilating into b b-bar, with a thermally
averaged annihilation cross section corresponding to < \sigma v> = 8 X 10^(-27) cm^3/s, spurs
interest in a Higgs portal model suggested by Steven Weinberg. Other implications of this model
are also explored such as its ability to explain dark matter direct detection results along with
LHC Higgs data, and Planck data. Particle physics is complimented by possible stochastic gravitational
wave searches for which a model of second order global phase transitions is explored. These transitions
generate gravitational wave spectra with amplitudes of order \Omega_{gw} h^2 = 10^(-24) - 10^(-15).
Furthermore, techniques into such calculations are investigated in hopes to improve the stability
required in such lattice simulations.
