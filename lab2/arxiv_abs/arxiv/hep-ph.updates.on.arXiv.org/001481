In this paper such processes which act as a source of double Higgs production (2H) as well as triple
Higgs production (3H) at future linear colliders are analyzed with in 2HDM and its special type-II,
MSSM at various center of mass energies. The main aim of this study is to compute and also compare the
cross-sections in double and triple Higgs production processes at the future linear colliders.
The production of double charged Higgs boson ($H^{+}H^{-}$) as well as triple Higgs boson ($H^{+}H^{-}H^{0}$),($H^{+}H^{-}h^{0}$)
are considered for study at two center of mass energies (1.5 TeV and 3 TeV) within two models 2HDM and
MSSM at future linear colliders. It is observed that for double charged Higgs production process
(H${}^{+}$H${}^{-}$) the resulting cross-section values are almost same in both the models (in
2HDM and MSSM). On the other hand in the case of Triple Higgs production process ($H^{+}H^{-}H^{0}$),
($H^{+}H^{-}h{0}$) several orders of enhancement in cross-sections is observed in 2HDM as compared
to MSSM. Similarly two types of processes, neutral Higgs pair production ($A^{0} H^{0}$) as well
as ($A^{0} h^{0}$) and triple neutral Higgs production ($h^{0}h^{0}A^{0}$) is analyzed in 2HDM
type-I at the future linear ${\mu}^{+}$${\mu}^{-\ }$ collider for various values of center of mass
energies from 500 GeV to 3000 GeV (0.5 TeV to 3 TeV). It is observed that the cross-section for neutral
Higgs pair production ($A^{0} h^{0}$) process is comparatively greater than that of neutral Higgs
pair production ($A^{0} H^{0}$) process. Similarly for neutral Higgs Triple production ($h^{0}h^{0}A^{0}$)
an enhancement is seen in cross-sections with increase of tan{\ss}.
