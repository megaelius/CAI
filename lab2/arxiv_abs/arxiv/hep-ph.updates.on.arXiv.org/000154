SHARE with CHARM program (SHAREv3) implements the statistical hadronization model description
of particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Given a set of statistical parameters,
SHAREv3 program evaluates yields and therefore also ratios, and furthermore, statistical particle
abundance fluctuations. The physical bulk properties of the particle source is evaluated based
on all hadrons produced, including the fitted yields. The bulk properties can be prescribed as a
fit input complementing and/or replacing the statistical parameters. The modifications and improvements
in the SHARE suite of programs are oriented towards recent and forthcoming LHC hadron production
results including charm hadrons. This SHAREv3 release incorporates all features seen previously
in SHAREv1.x and v2.x and, beyond, we include a complete treatment of charm hadrons and their decays,
which further cascade and feed lighter hadron yields. This article is a complete and self-contained
manual explaining and introducing both the conventional and the extended capabilities of SHARE
with CHARM. We complement the particle list derived from the Particle Data Group tabulation composed
of up, down, strange $u,d,s$ quarks (including resonances) with hadrons containing charm $c,\bar
c$ quarks. We provide a table of the charm hadron decays including partial widths. The branching
ratios of each charm hadron decays add to unity, which is achieved by including some charm hadron
decay channels based on theoretical consideration in the absence of direct experimental information.
A very successful interpretation of all available LHC results has been already obtained using this
program.
