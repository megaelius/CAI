Effects of heavy sea quarks on the low energy physics are described by an effective theory where the
expansion parameter is the inverse quark mass, 1/$M$. At leading order in 1/$M$ (and neglecting
light quark masses) the dependence of any low energy quantity on $M$ is given in terms of the ratio
of $\Lambda$ parameters of the effective and the fundamental theory. We define a function describing
the scaling with the mass $M$. We find that its perturbative expansion is very reliable for the bottom
quark and also seems to work very well at the charm quark mass. The same is then true for the ratios of
$\Lambda^{(4)}/\Lambda^{(5)}$ and $\Lambda^{(3)}/\Lambda^{(4)}$, which play a major r\^ole
in connecting lattice determinations of $\alpha^{(3)}_{MSbar}$ from the three-flavor theory
with $\alpha^{(5)}_{MSbar}(M_Z)$. Also the charm quark content of the nucleon, relevant for dark
matter searches, can be computed accurately from perturbation theory. We investigate a very closely
related model, namely QCD with $N_f=2$ heavy quarks. Our non-perturbative information is derived
from simulations on the lattice, with masses up to the charm quark mass and lattice spacings down
to about 0.023 fm followed by a continuum extrapolation. The non-perturbative mass dependence
agrees within rather small errors with the perturbative prediction at masses around the charm quark
mass. Surprisingly, from studying solely the massive theory we can make a prediction for the ratio
$Q^{1/\sqrt{t_0}}_{0,2}=[\Lambda \sqrt{t_0(0)}]_{N_f=2}/[\Lambda \sqrt{t_0}]_{N_f=0}$,
which refers to the chiral limit in $N_f=2$. Here $t_0$ is the Gradient Flow scale of [1]. The uncertainty
for $Q$ is estimated to be 2.5%. For the phenomenologically interesting $\Lambda^{(3)}/\Lambda^{(4)}$,
we conclude that perturbation theory introduces errors which are at most at the 1.5% level, far smaller
than other current uncertainties.
