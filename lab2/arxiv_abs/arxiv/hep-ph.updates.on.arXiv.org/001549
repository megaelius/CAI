We argue that since broken symmetry phases of (Super) Yang Mills Higgs((S)YMH) theories share their
Renormalization Group (RG) flow equations with the unbroken symmetry phase their flows all merge
into a common symmetry restored confining high energy phase. This applies both to theories with
Gaussian fixed points and to those with gauge Landau poles in their UV flows. The `Landau pole phase'
is characterised by the formation of {\emph{physical}} gauge-singlet condensates that form an
ineluctable background present in all the symmetry broken phases allowed in the intermediate energy
range with weak gauge coupling. Using consistency requirements relating chiral condensates imposed
by the so called Generalized Konishi Anomaly, we show that dimensional transmutation via gaugino
condensation {\emph{in the ultraviolet}} drives gauge symmetry breaking in a large class of {\emph{asymptotically
strong}} SYMH theories. For Adjoint multiplet type chiral superfields $\Phi$ (transforming as
$r \times \bar r$ representations of a non Abelian gauge group G), solution of the Generalized Konishi
Anomaly(GKA) equations allows calculation of quantum corrected VEVs in terms of the dimensional
transmutation scale $\Lambda_{UV} \simeq M_X \, e^{\frac{8\pi^2}{ g^2(M_X) b_0}} $ which determines
the G-singlet physical gaugino condensate. Thus the gauge coupling at the perturbative unification
scale $M_X$ generates GUT symmetry breaking VEVs by non-perturbative dimensional transmutation.
This obviates the need for large(or any) input mass scales in the superpotential. We sketch the structure
of a realistic Spin(10) model, with the $16$-plet of Spin(10) as the base representation $r$, which
mimics the realistic Minimal Supersymmetric GUT but contains even fewer free parameters.
