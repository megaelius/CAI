Nucleon spin structure functions have been investigated mainly by longitudinally-polarized
ones for finding the origin of the nucleon spin. Other types of spin structure functions are transversely-polarized
ones. In particular, quark transversity distributions in the nucleons have very different properties
from the longitudinally-polarized quark distribution functions, especially in scaling violation,
because they are decoupled from the gluon transversity, due to the fact that they are helicity-flip
(chiral-odd) distributions. Such studies are valuable for finding not only the origin of the nucleon
spin but also a signature on physics beyond the standard model, because the electric dipole moment
of the neutron is proportional to the transversity distributions. Now, there is experimental progress
on the quark transversity distributions; however, there is no experimental information on gluon
transversity. In fact, the gluon transversity does not exist for the spin-1/2 nucleon due to the
helicity-conservation constraint. One needs a hadron with spin more than or equal to one, so that
the helicity flip of two units is allowed. A stable spin-1 target is, for example, the deuteron for
studying the gluon transversity. In this work, we propose a possibility for finding the gluon transversity
at hadron-accelerator facilities, especially in the proton-deuteron Drell-Yan process with
the linearly-polarized deuteron, by showing theoretical formalism and numerical results. We
show the dependencies of the Drell-Yan cross section on the dimuon-mass squared $M_{\mu\mu}^{\,2}$,
the dimuon transverse-momentum $q_T$, the dimuon rapidity $y$ in the center-of-momentum frame,
and the magnitude of the gluon transversity $\Delta_T g$.
