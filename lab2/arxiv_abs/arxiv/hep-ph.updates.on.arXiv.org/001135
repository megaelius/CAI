By employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach, we made a systematic investigation
for the CP-averaged branching ratios and the CP-violating asymmetries of the thirteen $\bar{B}^0_s
\to PP $ decays ( here $P=(\pi,K, \eta, \eta^{\prime})$) with the inclusion of all currently known
next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions, and compared our results with the measured values
or the theoretical predictions from other different approaches. We focused on the examination
of the effects of the NLO contributions and found the following points: (a) for $\bar{B}_s^0 \to
(K^0 \bar{K}^0, K^+ K^-, \eta^\prime \eta^\prime,\pi^- K^+)$ decays, the NLO contributions can
provide a $(40-150) \%$ enhancement or a $20\%$ reduction to the corresponding leading order (LO)
PQCD predictions for their decay rates and result in a much better agreement between the PQCD predictions
and the experimental measurements; (b) for the pure annihilation decay $\bar{B}_s^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-$,
the PQCD prediction still remain consistent with the data after the inclusion of the small NLO reduction;
(c) the PQCD predictions for the ratio $(f_s/f_d)\cdot {\cal B}(B_s^0\to \pi^+\pi^-)/{\cal B}(B^0\to
K^+\pi^-)$ and $(f_s/f_d)\cdot {\cal B}(B_s^0\to \pi^+ K^-)/{\cal B}(B^0\to K^+\pi^-)$ become
agree very well with the measured ones after the inclusion of a $40\%$ NLO reduction; (d) for $\bar{B}_s^0
\to K^+ K^-$ and $\bar{B}_s^0 \to \pi^- K^+$ decays, the NLO PQCD predictions for their CP-violating
asymmetries do agree very well with the measured values in both the sign and the magnitude; and (e)
for all $\bar{B}_s^0 \to P P$ decays, we also compared our results with those obtained in the QCD factorization
approach and soft-collinear effective theory and discussed their similarities and differences.
