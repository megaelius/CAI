For direct CP-violation in $K\to\pi\pi$ decays, the usual isospin-breaking effects at the percent
level are amplified by the dynamics behind the $\Delta I=1/2$ rule and conventionally encoded in
$\Omega_{\rm IB}$ parameters. The updated prediction $\Omega_{\rm IB}^{(8)}=(15.9\pm 8.2)\times
10^{-2}$ of the Chiral Perturbation Theory for the strong isospin-breaking due to $\pi_3-\eta_8$
mixing confirms such a tendency but is quite sensitive to the theoretical input value of the low-energy
constant corresponding to the flavour-singlet $\eta_0$ exchange contribution in this truncated
octet scheme. We rather exploit the phenomenological $\eta_8-\eta_0$ mixing as a probe for the
non-negligible flavour-singlet component of the physical $\eta$ pole to find $\Omega_{\rm IB}^{(9)}=(35\pm7)\times
10^{-2}$ in a complete nonet scheme. A large central value in the nonet scheme is thus substituted
for a large uncertainty in the octet one. Including the experimental $\pi^+-\pi^0$ mass difference
as the dominant electromagnetic isospin-breaking, we obtain for the effective parameter entering
the ratio $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ an improved result $\hat\Omega_{\rm eff}^{(9)}=(29\pm7)\times
10^{-2}$ to be compared with $\hat\Omega_{\rm eff}^{(8)}=(17\pm9)\times 10^{-2}$ used in recent
analyses of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$. Accordingly, we get a reduction from $(\epsilon'/\epsilon)_{SM}^{(8)}=(17.4\pm
6.1)\times 10^{-4}$ to $(\epsilon'/\epsilon)_{SM}^{(9)}=(13.9\pm 5.2)\times 10^{-4}$ and
thereby an effective suppression of $(\epsilon'/\epsilon)_{SM}$ by isospin-breaking corrections
as large as $36\%$ relative to the recent RBC-UKQCD value.
