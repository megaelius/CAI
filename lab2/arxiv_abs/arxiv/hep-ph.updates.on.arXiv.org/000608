We show how the scales responsible for Peccei-Quinn (PQ), seesaw, and Froggatt and Nielsen (FN)
mechanisms can be fixed, by constructing a compact model for resolving rather recent, but fast-growing
issues in astro-particle physics, including quark and leptonic mixings and CP violations, high-energy
neutrinos, QCD axion, and axion cooling of stars. The model is motivated by the flavored PQ symmetry
for unifying the flavor physics and string theory. The QCD axion decay constant congruent to the
seesaw scale, through its connection to the astro-particle constraints of both the stellar evolution
induced by the flavored-axion bremsstrahlung off electrons $e+Ze\rightarrow Ze+e+A_i$ and the
rare flavor-changing decay process induced by the flavored-axion $K^+\rightarrow\pi^++A_i$,
is shown to be fixed at $F_A=3.56^{+0.84}_{-0.84}\times10^{10}$ GeV (consequently, the QCD axion
mass $m_a=1.54^{+0.48}_{-0.29}\times10^{-4}$ eV, Compton wavelength of its oscillation $\lambda_a=8.04^{+1.90}_{-1.90}\,{\rm
mm}$, and axion to neutron coupling $g_{Ann}=2.14^{+0.66}_{-0.41}\times10^{-12}$, etc.).
Subsequently, the scale associated to FN mechanism is dynamically fixed through its connection
to the standard model fermion masses and mixings, $\Lambda=2.04^{\,+0.48}_{\,-0.48}\times10^{11}\,{\rm
GeV}$, and such fundamental scale might give a hint where some string moduli are stabilized in type-IIB
string vacua. In the near future, the NA62 experiment expected to reach the sensitivity of ${\rm
Br}(K^+\rightarrow\pi^++A_i)<1.0\times10^{-12}$ will probe the flavored-axions or exclude
the model, if the astrophysical constraint of star cooling is really responsible for the flavored-axion.
