I consider neutron electric dipole moment contributions induced by flavor changing Standard Model
Higgs boson couplings to quarks. Such couplings might stem from non-renormalizable $SU(2)_L \times
U(1)_Y$ invariant Lagrange terms of dimension six, containing a product of three Higgs doublets.
Previously one loop diagrams with such couplings were considered in order to constrain {\it quadratric}
expressions of Higgs flavor changing couplings to quarks. In the present paper the analysis is extended
to the two loop level, where there are diagrams for electric dipole moments of quarks with a flavor
changing Higgs coupling to {\it first order only}. The divergent loops, due to non-renormalisabillity,
are parametrized in terms of an ultraviolet cut-off $\Lambda$. I also consider QCD corrections,
including the mixing with the color electric dipole moment, while the contribution from the Weinberg
operator is found to be negligible. The effect of QCD corrections is to suppress the bare result.
Using the current experimental bound on the neutron electric dipole moment, then for cut offs from
one to seven TeV, I find a constraint of order $10^{-3}$ for the imaginary part of the {\it product}
of the Higgs flavor changing coupling for $(d \rightarrow b)$-transition {\it and} the CKM element
$V_{td}$. Assuming that the previous bound of the {\it absolute value} of the Higgs flavor changing
coupling for $(d \rightarrow b)$-transition obtained from $B_d - \bar{B_d}$-mixing is saturated,
the experimental bound on the neutron electric dipole moment would be reached for the {\it bare}
result, {\it if} the cut off were extended up to about ca 20 TeV. However, QCD corrections suppress
this result by a factor of order ten, and keep the nEDM below the experimental bound.
