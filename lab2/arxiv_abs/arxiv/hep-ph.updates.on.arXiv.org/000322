We propose a method for calculating the nucleon form factors (FFs) of $G$-parity-even operators
by combining Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT) and dispersion analysis. The FFs are expressed
as dispersive integrals over the two-pion cut at $t > 4 M_\pi^2$. The spectral functions are obtained
from the elastic unitarity condition and expressed as products of the complex $\pi\pi \rightarrow
N\bar N$ partial-wave amplitudes and the timelike pion FF. $\chi$EFT is used to calculate the ratio
of the partial-wave amplitudes and the pion FF, which is real and free of $\pi\pi$ rescattering in
the $t$-channel ($N/D$ method). The rescattering effects are then incorporated by multiplying
with the squared modulus of the empirical pion FF. The procedure results in a marked improvement
compared to conventional $\chi$EFT calculations of the spectral functions. We apply the method
to the nucleon scalar FF and compute the scalar spectral function, the scalar radius, the $t$-dependent
FF, and the Cheng-Dashen discrepancy. Higher-order chiral corrections are estimated through
the $\pi N$ low-energy constants. Results are in excellent agreement with dispersion-theoretical
calculations. We elaborate several other interesting aspects of our method. The results show proper
scaling behavior in the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD because the $\chi$EFT calculation includes $N$
and $\Delta$ intermediate states. The squared modulus of the timelike pion FF required by our method
can be extracted from Lattice QCD calculations of vacuum correlation functions of the operator
at large Euclidean distances. Our method can be applied to the nucleon FFs of other operators of interest,
such as the isovector-vector current, the energy-momentum tensor, and twist-2 QCD operators (moments
of generalized parton distributions).
