The Spectral Action Principle in the noncommutative geometry framework provides simultaneous
derivation of the actions of the Standard Model and General Relativity by reconciling them in a geometric
setting, and hence offers an explanation for their common origin. However, one of the requirements
in the minimal formalism, unification of the gauge coupling constants, is not satisfied, since
the basic construction does not introduce anything new that can change the renormalization group
running of the Standard Model, in which unification is known not to be realized; this is indeed one
of the reasons why extensions to the minimal formalism have been constructed. On the other hand,
it has been recently argued that incorporating structure of the Clifford algebra into the finite
part of the spectral triple, which is the main object that encodes the complete information of a noncommutative
space, gives rise to five additional scalar fields in the basic framework, three of which have the
same quantum numbers. In this paper, we address the question whether these scalars can help to achieve
unification of the gauge couplings in this modified minimal formalism. Adopting the most general
approach, we perform a six-parameter renormalization group analysis at the one-loop level, allowing
the mass values of these five scalars to float from the electroweak scale to putative unification
scale, i.e. emergence scale of the spectral action. We show that out of twenty possible configurations
of mass hierarchy of these additional scalars, there does not exist even a single case that can lead
to unification. In consequence, the spectral action formalism requires a model construction scheme
beyond the (modified) minimal framework.
