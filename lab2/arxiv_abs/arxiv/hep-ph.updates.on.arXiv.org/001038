We present in this paper our new program package ewN2HDECAY for the calculation of the partial decay
widths and branching ratios of the Higgs bosons of the Next-to-Minimal 2-Higgs Doublet Model (N2HDM).
The N2HDM is based on a general CP-conserving 2HDM which is extended by a real scalar singlet field.
The program computes the complete electroweak one-loop corrections to all non-loop-induced two-body
on-shell Higgs boson decays in the N2HDM and combines them with the state-of-the-art QCD corrections
that are already implemented in the existing program N2HDECAY. Most of the independent input parameters
of the electroweak sector of the N2HDM are renormalized in an on-shell scheme. The soft-$\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking
squared mass scale $m_{12}^2$ and the vacuum expectation value $v_S$ of the $SU(2)_L$ singlet field,
however, are renormalized with $\overline{\text{MS}}$ conditions, while for the four scalar
mixing angles $\alpha _i$ ($i=1,2,3$) and $\beta$ of the N2HDM, several different renormalization
schemes are applied. By giving out the leading-order and the loop-corrected partial decay widths
separately from the branching ratios, the program ewN2HDECAY not only allows for phenomenological
analyses of the N2HDM at highest precision, it can also be used for a study of the impact of the electroweak
corrections and the remaining theoretical uncertainty due to missing higher-order corrections
based on a change of the renormalization scheme. The input parameters are then consistently calculated
with a parameter conversion routine when switching from one renormalization scheme to the other.
