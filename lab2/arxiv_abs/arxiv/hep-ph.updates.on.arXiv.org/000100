Searches for dispersive effects in the propagation of light at cosmological distances have been
touted as sensitive probes of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) and of theories of quantum gravity.
Frequency-dependent time lags between simultaneously emitted pulses of light can signal a modification
in the photon dispersion relation; however, matter engenders the cosmos with a dispersive index
of refraction to similar effect. We construct a theoretical framework for the analysis of such effects,
contrasting these dispersive terms with those from LIV models. We consider all matter, both luminous
and dark. Though the only known mode of interaction for dark matter (DM) is gravitational, most models
of dark matter also allow for electromagnetic interactions, if only at the one-loop level in perturbation
theory. Generically, the leading order dispersive effects due to matter scale with photon energy
as \omega^{-2} for a charged DM candidate and \omega^2 for a neutral DM candidate. Terms linear in
\omega can arise in the index of refraction if parity and charge-parity asymmetries are present
at the Lagrangian or system level. Herein, we compute the index of refraction for a millicharged
dark matter candidate at the one-loop level, a neutral scalar DM candidate introduced by Boehm and
Fayet, and the MSSM's neutralino. For a neutral DM candidate, we determine that matter effects can
compete with LIV effects that depend quadratically on energy whenever the photon energy is beyond
10^{29} GeV, well beyond the GZK cutoff. The dispersive matter effects that scale linearly with
\omega are model dependent, and their existence results in circular birefringence.
