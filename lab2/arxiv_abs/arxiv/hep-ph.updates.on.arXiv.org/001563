The dynamics of the subatomic fundamental particles, represented by quantum fields, and their
interactions are determined uniquely by the assigned transformation properties, i.e., the quantum
numbers associated with the underlying symmetry of the model. These fields constitute a finite
number of group invariant operators which are assembled to build a polynomial, known as the Lagrangian.
The order of the polynomial is determined by the mass dimension. In this paper, we have introduced
a Mathematica package, GrIP, that computes the complete set of operators that form a basis at each
such order for a model containing any number of fields transforming under connected compact groups.
The spacetime symmetry is restricted to the Lorentz group. The first part of the paper is dedicated
to formulating the algorithm of GrIP. In this context, the detailed and explicit construction of
the characters of different representations corresponding to connected compact groups and respective
Haar measures have been discussed in terms of the coordinates of their respective maximal torus.
In the second part, we have documented the user manual of GrIP that captures the generic features
and guides to prepare the input file. This program works very efficiently to find out the higher mass
(non-supersymmetric) and canonical (supersymmetric) dimensional operators relevant to the
Effective Field Theory. We have demonstrated the working principles with two examples:- the SM
and the MSSM. We have further highlighted important features of GrIP, e.g., identification of effective
operators leading to specific rare processes linked with the violation of baryon and lepton numbers,
using several BSM scenarios. We have also tabulated a complete set of dimension-6 operators for
each such model. Some of the operators possess rich flavour structures which are discussed in detail.
This work paves the way towards BSM-EFT.
