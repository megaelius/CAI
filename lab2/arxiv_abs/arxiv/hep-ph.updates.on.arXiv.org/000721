Analyses in high energy physics aim to put the Standard Model---the commonly accepted theory---to
test. For convincing conclusions, analysis methods are needed which offer an unambiguous comparison
between data and theory while allowing reliable estimates of uncertainties. The Matrix Element
Method (MEM) is a Maximum Likelihood method which is especially tailored for signal searches and
parameter estimation at colliders. The MEM has proven to be beneficial due to optimal use of the available
information and a clean statistical interpretation of the results. But it has a big drawback: In
its original formulation, the likelihood calculation is intrinsically limited to the leading
perturbative order in the coupling. Higher-order corrections improve the accuracy of theoretical
predictions and allow for unambiguous field-theoretical interpretation of the extracted information.
In this work, the MEM incorporating corrections of next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD by defining
event weights suited for the likelihood calculation is presented for the first time. These weights
also enable the generation of unweighted events following the cross section calculated at NLO accuracy.
The method is demonstrated for top-quark events. The top-quark mass is determined with the MEM at
NLO accuracy from the generated events. The extracted estimators are in agreement with the input
values from the event generation. Repeating the mass determinations from the same events, without
NLO corrections in the predictions, results in biased estimators. These shifts may not be accounted
for by estimated theoretical uncertainties rendering the estimation of the theoretical uncertainties
unreliable in the leading-order analysis. The results emphasise the importance of the inclusion
of NLO corrections into the MEM.
