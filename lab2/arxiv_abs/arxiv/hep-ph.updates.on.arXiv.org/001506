The ratios among the leading-order (LO) hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contributions to the
anomalous magnetic moments of electron, muon and tau-lepton, $a_{\ell = e, \mu, \tau}^{ HVP, LO}$,
are computed using lattice QCD+QED simulations. The results include the effects at order $O(\alpha_{em}^2)$
as well as the electromagnetic and strong isospin-breaking corrections at orders $O(\alpha_{em}^3)$
and $O(\alpha_{em}^2 (m_u - m_d))$, respectively, where $(m_u - m_d)$ is the u- and d-quark mass
difference. We employ the gauge configurations generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration
with $N_f = 2+1+1$ dynamical quarks at three values of the lattice spacing ($a \simeq 0.062, 0.082,
0.089$ fm) with pion masses in the range 210 - 450 MeV. We show that in the case of the electron-muon
ratio the hadronic uncertainties in the numerator and in the denominator largely cancel out, while
in the cases of the electron-tau and muon-tau ratios such a cancellation does not occur. For the electron-muon
ratio we get $R_{e / \mu } \equiv (m_\mu / m_e)^2 (a_e^{HVP, LO} / a_\mu^{HVP, LO}) = 1.1478~(70)$
with an uncertainty of ~ 0.6 %. Our result, which represents an accurate Standard Model (SM) prediction,
agrees very well with the estimate obtained using the results of dispersive analyses of the experimental
$e^+ e^- \to$ hadrons data. Instead, it differs by ~ 2.7 standard deviations from the value expected
from present electron and muon ($g - 2$) experiments after subtraction of the current estimates
of the QED, electro-weak, hadronic light-by-light and higher-order HVP contributions, namely
$R_{e / \mu} = 0.575~(213)$. An improvement of the precision of both the experiment and the QED contribution
to the electron ($g - 2$) by a factor of $\simeq 2$ could be sufficient to reach a tension with the SM
value of the ratio $R_{e / \mu }$ at a significance level of ~ 5 standard deviations.
