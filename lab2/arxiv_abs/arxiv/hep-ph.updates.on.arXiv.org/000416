We investigate the strength of the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) within the CP-violating
2-Higgs-Doublet Model (C2HDM). By applying a renormalisation scheme which allows efficient scans
of the C2HDM parameter space, we analyse the possibility of a strong first order EWPT required for
baryogenesis and study its phenomenological implications for the LHC. Like in the CP-conserving
(real) 2HDM (R2HDM) we find that a strong EWPT favours mass gaps between the non-SM-like Higgs bosons.
These lead to prominent final states comprised of gauge+Higgs bosons or pairs of Higgs bosons. In
contrast to the R2HDM, the CP-mixing of the C2HDM also favours approximately mass degenerate spectra
with dominant decays into SM particles. The requirement of a strong EWPT further allows us to distinguish
the C2HDM from the R2HDM using the signal strengths of the SM-like Higgs boson. We additionally find
that a strong EWPT requires an enhancement of the SM-like trilinear Higgs coupling at next-to-leading
order (NLO) by up to a factor of 2.4 compared to the NLO SM coupling, establishing another link between
cosmology and collider phenomenology. We provide several C2HDM benchmark scenarios compatible
with a strong EWPT and all experimental and theoretical constraints. We include the dominant branching
ratios of the non-SM-like Higgs bosons as well as the Higgs pair production cross section of the SM-like
Higgs boson for every benchmark point. The pair production cross sections can be substantially
enhanced compared to the SM and could be observable at the high-luminosity LHC, allowing access
to the trilinear Higgs couplings.
