We investigate the semileptonic decay of the scalar tetraquark $T_{bs; \overline{u}\overline{d}}^{-}$
to final state $T_{cs;\overline{u}\overline{d} }^{0} l \overline{\nu}_l$, which proceeds due
to the weak transition $b \to c l \overline{\nu}_l$. For these purposes, we calculate the spectroscopic
parameters of the final-state scalar tetraquark $T_{cs;\overline{u}\overline{ d}}^{0}$. In
calculations we use the QCD sum rule method by taking into account the quark, gluon, and mixed condensates
up to dimension 10. The mass of the $T_{cs;\overline{u}\overline{d}}^{0}$ obtained in the present
work $( 2878 \pm 128 )~\mathrm{MeV}$ indicates that it is unstable against the strong interactions
and decays to the mesons $D^{0}\overline{K^{0}}$ and $ D^{+}K^{-}$. Partial widths of these $S$-wave
modes as well as the full width of the tetraquark $T_{cs;\overline{u}\overline{d}}^{0}$ are found
by means of the QCD light-cone sum rule method and technical tools of the soft-meson approximation.
The partial widths of the main semileptonic processes $T_{bs;\overline{u}\overline{d}}^{-}
\to T_{cs;\overline{u} \overline{d}}^{0}l\overline{\nu}_l$, $l=e, \mu$, and $\tau$ are computed
by employing the weak form factors $G_{1}(q^2)$ and $G_{2}(q^2)$, which are extracted from the
QCD three-point sum rules. We also trace back the weak transformations of the stable tetraquark
$T_{bb;\overline{u}\overline{d} }^{-} $ to conventional mesons. The obtained results for the
full width $ \Gamma_{\mathrm{full}}=(3.28\pm 0.48) \times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{MeV} $ and mean
lifetime $2.01_{-0.26}^{+0.34}~\mathrm{ps}$ of $T_{bs;\overline{u} \overline{d}}^{-}$,
as well as predictions for decay channels of the tetraquark $T_{bb;\overline{u}\overline{d}}^{-}$
can be used in experimental studies of these exotic states.
