We consider scenarios with a heavy $Z^\prime$ gauge boson with flavour non-universal quark and
lepton couplings with the goal to illustrate how the cancellation of gauge anomalies generated
by the additional U(1)$^\prime$ gauge symmetry would imply correlations between FCNC processes
in the quark sector, in the lepton sector and most interestingly between quark flavour and lepton
flavour violating processes. We present scenarios with only left-handed flavour-violating $Z^\prime$
couplings and those with also right-handed flavour-violating couplings. These are characterized
by a small number of free parameters but in contrast to gauge anomaly cancellation in the Standard
Model, that takes place separately within each generation, in our scenarios anomaly cancellation
involves simultaneously quarks and leptons of all three generations. Our models involve, beyond
the ordinary quarks and leptons, three heavy right-handed neutrinos. The models with only left-handed
FCNCs of $Z^\prime$ involve beyond $g_{Z^\prime}$ and $M_{Z^\prime}$ two real parameters characterizing
the charges of all fermions under the U(1)$^\prime$ gauge symmetry and the CKM and PMNS ones in the
quark and lepton sectors, respectively. The models with the right-handed FCNCs of $Z^\prime$ involve
few additional parameters. Imposing constraints from well measured $\Delta F=2$ observables
we identify interesting correlations that involve e.g. $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$, $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$,
$B\to K(K^*) \ell^+\ell^-$, $K^+\rightarrow\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$, $K_{L}\rightarrow\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$
and purely lepton flavour violating decays like $\mu\to e\gamma$, $\mu\to 3 e$, $\tau\to 3\mu$
and $\mu-e$ conversion} among others. Also $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$ are considered. The impact of the experimental
$\mu\to e\gamma$, $\mu\to 3 e$ and in particular $\mu-e$ conversion bounds on rare $K$ and $B$ decays
is emphasized.
