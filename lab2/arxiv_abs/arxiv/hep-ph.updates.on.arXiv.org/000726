Unlike other observational signatures in cosmology, the angular-diameter distance d_A(z) uniquely
reaches a maximum (at z_max) and then shrinks to zero towards the big bang. The location of this turning
point depends sensitively on the model, but has been difficult to measure. In this paper, we estimate
and use z_max inferred from quasar cores: (1) by employing a sample of 140 objects yielding a much
reduced dispersion due to pre-constrained limits on their spectral index and luminosity, (2) by
reconstructing d_A(z) using Gaussian processes, and (3) comparing the predictions of seven different
cosmologies and showing that the measured value of z_max can effectively discriminate between
them. We find that z_max=1.70 +\- 0.20---an important new probe of the Universe's geometry. The
most strongly favoured model is R_h=ct, followed by Planck LCDM. Several others, including Milne,
Einstein-de Sitter and Static tired light are strongly rejected. According to these results, the
R_h=ct universe, which predicts z_max=1.718, has a ~92.8% probability of being the correct cosmology.
For consistency, we also carry out model selection based on d_A(z) itself. This test confirms that
R_h=ct and Planck LCDM are among the few models that account for angular-size data better than those
that are disfavoured by z_max. The d_A(z) comparison, however, is less discerning than that with
z_max, due to the additional free parameter, H_0. We find that H_0=63.4 +\- 1.2 km/s/Mpc for R_h=ct,
and 69.9 +\- 1.5 km/s/Mpc for LCDM. Both are consistent with previously measured values in each model,
though they differ from each other by over 4 sigma. In contrast, model selection based on z_max is
independent of H_0.
