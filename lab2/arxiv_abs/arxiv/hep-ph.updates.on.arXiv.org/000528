Introducing version 2 of the code vh@nnlo, we study the effects of a number of new-physics scenarios
on the Higgs-Strahlung process. In particular, the cross section is evaluated within a general
2HDM and the MSSM. While the Drell-Yan-like contributions are consistently taken into account
by a simple rescaling of the SM result, the gluon-initiated contribution is supplemented by squark-loop
mediated amplitudes, and by the $s$-channel exchange of additional scalars which may lead to conspicuous
interference effects. The latter holds as well for bottom-quark initiated Higgs Strahlung, which
is also included in the new version of vh@nnlo. Using an orthogonal rotation of the three Higgs CP
eigenstates in the 2HDM and the MSSM, vh@nnlo incorporates a simple means of CP mixing in these models.
Moreover, the effect of vector-like quarks in the SM on the gluon-initiated contribution can be
studied. Beyond concrete models, vh@nnlo allows to include the effect of higher-dimensional operators
on the production of CP-even Higgs bosons. Transverse momentum distributions of the final state
Higgs boson and invariant mass distributions of the $V\phi$ final state for the gluon- and bottom-quark
initiated contributions can be studied. Distributions for the Drell-Yan-like component of Higgs-Strahlung
can be included through a link to MCFM. vh@nnlo can also be linked to FeynHiggs and 2HDMC for the calculation
of Higgs masses and mixing angles. It can also read these parameters from an SLHA-file as produced
by standard spectrum generators. Throughout the manuscript, we highlight new-physics effects
in various numerical examples, both at the inclusive level and for distributions.
