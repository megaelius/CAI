We present a hypothesis that the anomaly in the folding angle distribution of electron-positron
pairs, emitted in the decay of the excited levels of nucleus $^{8}$Be and $^{4}$He can be related
to the cluster structure of the decaying state. Furthermore, we present a hypothesis that the potentially
observed boson with rest mass $m_{X}$=17 MeV can mediate the nucleon-nucleon interaction at the
low-energy regime of QCD, in particular in the weakly bound cluster state p+$^{3}$H. We present
a range of possible equations of state of symmetric nuclear matter corresponding to the vector meson
mass $m_{v}$=17 MeV, and obtained using relativistic mean field theory of nuclear force, QHD-I
in particular. The narrow range of cubic and quartic couplings $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ allows to
obtain both very stiff and very soft equations of state, including the equations of state of physical
interest with incompessibility K$_{0}$=240-260 MeV. The values of couplings $g_{v}$, $g_{s}$
are lower than unity. Based on concepts of instanton liquid model and resulting chiral symmetry
breaking, we show that reduction of the rest mass of pseudoscalar particle from physical value $m_{\pi}$=135
MeV to $m_{X}$=17 MeV is equivalent to reduction of the quark mass from dynamical value around 310
MeV down to current quark mass around 5 MeV ($\frac{m_{X}^2} {m_{q,curr}} \simeq \frac{m_{\pi}^2}
{m_{q,dyn}}$). Assumption of conservation of axial current and resulting variant of Goldberger-Treiman
relation leads to the value of coupling close to the results from relativistic mean field theory
of nuclear force. Both model approaches thus point towards apparent restoration of chiral symmetry
in nucleon-nucleon interaction at large distances.
