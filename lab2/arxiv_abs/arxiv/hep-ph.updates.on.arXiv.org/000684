The discovery of the Higgs boson at $\sim 125$ GeV indicates that the scale of weak scale supersymmetry
is higher than what was perceived in the pre-Higgs boson discovery era and lies in the several TeV
region. This makes the discovery of supersymmetry more challenging and argues for hadron colliders
beyond LHC at $\sqrt s=14$ TeV. The Future Circular Collider (FCC) study at CERN is considering a
100 TeV collider to be installed in a 100 km tunnel in the Lake Geneva basin. Another 100 km collider
being considered in China is the Super proton-proton Collider (SppC). A third possibility recently
proposed is the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) which would use the existing CERN tunnel but achieve a center-of-mass
energy of 28 TeV by using FCC magnet technology at significantly higher luminosity than at the High
Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In this work we investigate the potential of HE-LHC for the discovery of
supersymmetry. We study a class of supergravity unified models under the Higgs boson mass and the
dark matter relic density constraints and compare the analysis with the potential reach of the HL-LHC.
A set of benchmarks are presented which are beyond the discovery potential of HL-LHC but are discoverable
at HE-LHC. For comparison, we study model points at HE-LHC which are also discoverable at HL-LHC.
For these model points, it is found that their discovery would require a HL-LHC run between 5-8 years
while the same parameter points can be discovered in a period of few weeks to $\sim 1.5$ yr at HE-LHC
running at its optimal luminosity of $2.5\times 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The analysis indicates
that the HE-LHC possibility should be seriously pursued as it would significantly increase the
discovery reach for supersymmetry beyond that of HL-LHC and decrease the run period for discovery.
