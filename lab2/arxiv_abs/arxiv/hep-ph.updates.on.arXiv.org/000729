Motivated by the recent shocking results from RHIC and LHC that show quark-gluon plasma signatures
in small systems, we study a simple model of a massless, noninteracting scalar field confined with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. We use this system to investigate the finite size corrections to
thermal field theoretically derived quantities compared to the usual Stefan-Boltzmann limit
of an ideal gas not confined in any direction. Two equivalent expressions with different numerical
convergence properties are found for the free energy in $D$ rectilinear spacetime dimensions with
$c\le D-1$ spatial dimensions of finite extent. We find that the First Law of Thermodynamics generalizes
such that the pressure depends on direction but that the Third Law is respected. For systems with
finite dimension(s) but infinite volumes, such as a field constrained between two parallel plates
or a rectangular tube, the relative fluctuations in energy are zero, and hence the canonical and
microcanonical ensembles are equivalent. We present precise numerical results for the free energy,
total internal energy, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity of our field between parallel plates,
in a tube, and in finite volume boxes of various sizes in 4 spacetime dimensions. For temperatures
and system sizes relevant for heavy ion phenomenology, we find large deviations from the Stefan-Boltzmann
limit for these quantities, especially for the pressure. Further investigation of an isolated
system of fields constrained between parallel plates reveals a divergent isoenergetic compressibility
at a critical length $L_c\sim1/T$. We have thus discovered a new second order phase transition via
a first principles calculation, a transition that is driven by the size of the system.
