The measurements of particle multiplicity distributions have generated considerable interest
in understanding the fluctuations of conserved quantum numbers in the Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD) hadronization regime, in particular near a possible critical point and near the chemical
freeze-out. We report the measurement of efficiency and centrality bin width corrected cumulant
ratios ($C_{2}/C_{1}$, $C_{3}/C_{2}$) of net-$\Lambda$ distributions, in the context of both
strangeness and baryon number conservation, as a function of collision energy, centrality and
rapidity. The results are for Au + Au collisions at five beam energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 27,
39, 62.4 and 200 GeV) recorded with the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR). We compare our results
to the Poisson and negative binomial (NBD) expectations, as well as to Ultra-relativistic Quantum
Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) and Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model predictions. Both NBD and Poisson
baselines agree with data within the statistical and systematic uncertainties. The ratios of the
measured cumulants show no features of critical fluctuations. The chemical freeze-out temperatures
extracted from a recent HRG calculation, which was successfully used to describe the net-proton,
net-kaon and net-charge data, indicate $\Lambda$ freeze-out conditions similar to those of kaons.
However, large deviations are found when comparing to temperatures obtained from net-proton fluctuations.
The net-$\Lambda$ cumulants show a weak, but finite, dependence on the rapidity coverage in the
acceptance of the detector, which can be attributed to quantum number conservation.
