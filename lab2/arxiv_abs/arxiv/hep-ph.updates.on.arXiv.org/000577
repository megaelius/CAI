Recent data from LHC13 by the TOTEM Collaboration on $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ have indicated disagreement
with all the Pomeron model predictions by the COMPETE Collaboration (2002). On the other hand, as
recently demonstrated by Martynov and Nicolescu (MN), the new $\sigma_{tot}$ datum and the unexpected
decrease in the $\rho$ value are well described by the maximal Odderon dominance at the highest energies.
Here, we discuss the applicability of Pomeron dominance through fits to the \textit{most complete
set} of forward data from $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ scattering. We consider an analytic parametrization
for $\sigma_{tot}(s)$ consisting of non-degenerated Regge trajectories for even and odd amplitudes
(as in the MN analysis) and two Pomeron components associated with double and triple poles in the
complex angular momentum plane. The $\rho$ parameter is analytically determined by means of dispersion
relations. We carry out fits to $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ data on $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ in the interval
5 GeV - 13 TeV (as in the MN analysis). Two novel aspects of our analysis are: (1) the dataset comprises
all the accelerator data below 7 TeV and we consider \textit{three independent ensembles} by adding:
either only the TOTEM data (as in the MN analysis), or only the ATLAS data, or both sets; (2) in the data
reductions to each ensemble, uncertainty regions are evaluated through error propagation from
the fit parameters, with 90 \% CL. We argument that, within the uncertainties, this analytic model
corresponding to soft Pomeron dominance, does not seem to be excluded by the \textit{complete}
set of experimental data presently available.
