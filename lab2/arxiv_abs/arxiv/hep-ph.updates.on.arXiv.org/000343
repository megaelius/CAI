Dark matter (DM) particles are predicted by several well motivated models to yield Standard Model
particles through self-annihilation that can potentially be detected by astrophysical observations.
In particular, the production of charged particles from DM annihilation in astrophysical systems
that contain magnetic fields yields radio emission through synchrotron radiation and X-ray emission
through inverse Compton scattering of ambient photons. We introduce RX-DMFIT, a tool used for calculating
the expected secondary emission from DM annihilation. RX-DMFIT includes a wide range of customizable
astrophysical and particle parameters and incorporates important astrophysics including the
diffusion of charged particles, relevant radiative energy losses, and magnetic field modelling.
We demonstrate the use and versatility of RX-DMFIT by analyzing the potential radio and X-ray signals
for a variety of DM particle models and astrophysical environments including galaxy clusters,
dwarf spheroidal galaxies and normal galaxies. We then apply RX-DMFIT to a concrete example using
Segue I radio data to place constraints for a range of assumed DM annihilation channels. For WIMP
models with $M_{\chi} \leq 100$ GeV and assuming weak diffusion, we find that the the leptonic $\mu^+\mu^-$
and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states provide the strongest constraints, placing limits on the DM particle
cross-section well below the thermal relic cross-section, while even for the $b\bar{b}$ channel
we find limits close to the thermal relic cross-section. Our analysis shows that radio emission
provides a highly competitive avenue for dark matter searches.
