The global picture of the Higgs potential in the bottom-up approach is still unknown. A large deviation
as big as O(1) fluctuations of the Higgs self couplings is still a viable option for the New Physics.
An interesting New Physics scenario which can be linked to a large Higgs self coupling is the baryogenesis
based on the strong first order phase transition. We revisit the strong first order phase transition
in two classes of Beyond the Standard Models, namely the Higgs portal with the singlet scalar under
the Standard Model gauge group with Z2 symmetry and the effective field theory approach with higher-dimensional
operators. We numerically investigate a few important issues in the validity of the effective potential,
caused by the breakdown of the high-temperature approximation, and in the criteria for the strong
first order phase transition. We illustrate that these issues can lead to O(1) uncertainties in
the precision of the Higgs self couplings, which are relevant when discussing sensitivity limits
of different future colliders. We also find that the quartic coupling of the above two classes of
scenarios compatible with the strong first order electroweak phase transition where the cubic
coupling is not negligible, can achieve a $2\sigma$ sensitivity at the 100 TeV pp-collider. From
this novel observation, we show that the correlation between the Higgs cubic coupling and the quartic
coupling will be useful for differentiating various underlying New Physics scenarios and discuss
its prospect for the future colliders. Throughout our numerical investigation, the contribution
from Goldstone boson is not included.
