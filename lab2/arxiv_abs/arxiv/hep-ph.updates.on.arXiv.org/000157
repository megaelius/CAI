We present the first unbiased determination of spin-dependent, or polarized, Parton Distribution
Functions (PDFs) of the proton. A statistically sound representation of the corresponding uncertainties
is achieved by means of the NNPDF methodology: this was formerly developed for unpolarized distributions
and is now generalized to the polarized here for the first time. The features of the procedure, based
on robust statistical tools (Monte Carlo sampling for error propagation, neural networks for PDF
parametrization, genetic algorithm for their minimization, and possibly reweighting for including
new data samples without refitting), are illustrated in detail. Different sets of polarized PDFs
are obtained at next-to-leading order accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, based
on both fixed-target inclusive deeply-inelastic scattering data and the most recent polarized
collider data. A quantitative appraisal on the potential role of future measurements at an Electron-Ion
Collider is also presented. We study the stability of our results upon the variation of several theoretical
and methodological assumptions and we present a detailed investigation of the first moments of
our polarized PDFs, compared to other recent analyses. We find that the uncertainty on the gluon
distribution from available data was substantially underestimated in previous determinations;
in particular, we emphasize that a large contribution to the gluon may arise from the unmeasured
small-x region, against the common belief that this is actually rather small. We demonstrate that
an Electron-Ion Collider would provide evidence for a possible large gluon contribution to the
nucleon spin, though with a sizable residual uncertainty.
