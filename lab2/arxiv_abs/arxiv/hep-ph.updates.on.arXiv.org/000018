In this work we study basic properties of unstable particles and scalar hadronic resonances, respectively,
within simple quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical (effective) models. We start with
the basic ideas of quantum field theory. In particular, we introduce the Feynman propagator for
unstable scalar resonances and motivate the idea that this kind of correlation function should
possess complex poles which parameterize the mass and decay width of the considered particle. We
also briefly discuss the problematic scalar sector in particle physics, emphasizing that hadronic
loop contributions dominate its dynamics. A whole chapter is dedicated to the method of analytic
continuation of complex functions through branch cuts into the so called second Riemann sheet.
This method is crucial in order to describe physics of scalar resonances because the Feynman propagator
of interacting quantum field theories will have branch cuts in the complex energy plane and complex
poles in the second Riemann sheet. We then apply these concepts to a simple non-relativistic Lee
model and demonstrate the physical implications, i.e., the motion of the propagator poles and the
behaviour of the spectral function. Besides that, we investigate the time evolution of a particle
described by such a model. In the last chapter, we finally concentrate on a simple quantum field theoretical
model which describes the decay of a scalar state into two (pseudo)scalar ones. It is investigated
how the motion of the propagator poles is influenced by loop contributions of the two (pseudo)scalar
particles. We perform a numerical study for a hadronic system involving a scalar seed state (alias
the \sigma-meson) that couples to pions. The unexpected emergence of a putative stable state below
the two-pion threshold is investigated and it is clarified under which conditions such a stable
state appears.
