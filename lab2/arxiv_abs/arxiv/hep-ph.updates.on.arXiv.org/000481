A recent study of 5 TeV $p$-Pb centrality combined a Glauber model of $p$-Pb collision geometry with
an assumption of linear scaling between $n_{ch}$ (charge) integrated within some $\eta$ acceptance
and the number of nucleon participants $N_{part}$. The study concluded that $N_{part}$ increases
to nearly 16 in central collisions, and the high-$p_t$ region of $p$-Pb $p_t$ spectra rescaled by
the Glauber-estimated number of $p$-N binary collisions remains consistent with a $p$-$p$ spectrum
for the same energy, independent of $p$-Pb centrality. However, the relation between $N_{part}$
and $n_{ch}$ derived from a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) study of ensemble-mean $\bar
p_t$ data for the same system is quite different. This article reports a detailed analysis of the
Glauber study and the question of centrality in $p$-A collisions. The Glauber centrality model
is compared with the $\bar p_t$ TCM to understand the sources of major differences. The assumption
of linear proportionality between $n_{ch}$ and $N_{part}$ is found to be inconsistent with $\bar
p_t$ data. Properties of the convolution integral relating a differential cross section and hadron
production model to an event distribution on $n_{ch}$ are examined. An alternative differential-cross-section
distribution is inferred from charge-multiplicity data, and the upper limit on $N_{part}$ is estimated
to be near 8. The TCM centrality model is then applied to $p_t$ spectrum ratios to predict results
for $p$-Pb spectra. The spectrum TCM is tested with identified-pion spectra from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions
and the result is consistent with previous $p$-$p$ TCM results. A TCM prediction that the spectrum
ratio at high $p_t$ should increase to 14 for central $p$-Pb collisions due to quadratic dependence
of dijet production on $n_{ch}$ is consistent with $\bar p_t$ data from the same system.
