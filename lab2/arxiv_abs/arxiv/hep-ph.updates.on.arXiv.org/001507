In this paper, we studied the semileptonic decays $B_s \to K^{(*)} \ell^+ \ell^-$ with $l^-=(e^-,\mu^-,\tau^-)$
by using the perturbative QCD (PQCD) and the "PQCD+Lattice" factorization approach, respectively.
We first evaluated all relevant form factors $F_i(q^2)$ in the low $q^2$ region using the PQCD approach,
and we also take the available Lattice QCD results at the end point $q^2_{max}$ as additional input
to improve the extrapolation of the form factors to the high $q^2$ region. We calculated the branching
ratios and other twelve kinds of physical observables. We find the following points: (a) for $ B_s
\to K l^+ l^-$ decays, the PQCD and "PQCD+Lattice" predictions for branching ratios (BRs) ${\cal
B}(B_s \to K l^+ l^-)$, the ratios of the BRs $R_K^{e\mu,\mu\tau }$ and the longitudinal polarization
asymmetry of the leptons $P_L$ agree well within errors; (b) the "PQCD+Lattice" prediction ${\cal
B}(B_s \to K^\ast \mu^+ \mu^-)=(2.58^{+0.69}_{-0.60})\times 10^{-8}$ does agree well with the
LHCb measured value $ (2.9\pm 1.1 ) \times 10^{-8}$; (c) for the angular observables $P_{1,2,3}$
and $P^\prime_{4,5,6,8}$ , our theoretical predictions for each lepton $l^-$ are consistent within
errors; (d) the theoretical predictions of the angular observables $P_3$ and $P'_{6,8}$ are less
than $10^{-2}$ in absolute value, but the magnitude of $P_{1,2}$ and $P'_{4,5}$ are larger than
$0.2$; and (e) the PQCD and "PQCD+Lattice" predictions of the binned values of all considered observables
in the two $q^2$-bins $[0.1-0.98]$GeV$^2$ and $[1.1-6]$GeV$^2$ generally agree with each other
and also be consistent with the LCSR results within errors. We believe that above predictions could
be measured by future LHCb and Belle-II experiments.
