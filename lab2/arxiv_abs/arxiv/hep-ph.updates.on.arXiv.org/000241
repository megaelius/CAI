Background: The total inclusive cross sections obtained for quasielastic (QE) scattering in the
Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE) are significantly larger than those calculated
by all models based on the impulse approximation and using the world average value for the axial mass
of $M_A \approx 1 \GeV$. This discrepancy has led to various, quite different explanations in terms
of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form of the axial form factor, increased vector
strength in nuclei, and initial two-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino
energy reconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate whether exclusive
observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to distinguish between the various proposed
reaction mechanisms. We determine the influence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction.
Method: We use the Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and
spectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple, but realistic treatment
of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers and spectra of knock-out nucleons and show
their sensitivity to the presence of 2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of
2p-2h excitations on the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead
to an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \ge 2$ while only the $n=1$ knock-out
remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra of knock-out nucleons do also change, but
their qualitative shape remains as before. In the energy reconstruction 2p-2h interactions lead
to a downward shift of the reconstructed energy; this effect of 2p-2h excitations disappears at
higher energies because the 2p-2h influence is spread out over a wider energy range.
