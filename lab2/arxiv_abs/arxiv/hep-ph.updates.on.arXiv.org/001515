Dark photon dark matter will resonantly convert into visible photons when the dark photon mass is
equal to the plasma frequency of the ambient medium. In cosmological contexts, this transition
leads to an extremely efficient, albeit short-lived, heating of the surrounding gas. Existing
work in this field has been predominantly focused on understanding the implications of these resonant
transitions in the limit that the plasma frequency of the Universe can be treated as being perfectly
homogeneous, i.e. neglecting inhomogeneities in the electron number density. In this work we focus
on the implications of heating from dark photon dark matter in the presence of inhomogeneous structure
(which is particularly relevant for dark photons with masses in the range $10^{-15} \lesssim m_{A'}
< 10^{-12}$ eV), emphasizing both the importance of inhomogeneous energy injection, as well as
the sensitivity of cosmological observations to the inhomogeneities themselves. More specifically,
we derive modified constraints on dark photon dark matter from the Ly-$\alpha$ forest, and show
that the presence of inhomogeneities allows one to extend constraints to masses outside of the range
that would be obtainable in the homogeneous limit, while only slightly relaxing their strength.
We then project sensitivity for near-future cosmological surveys that are hoping to measure the
21cm transition in neutral hydrogen prior to reionization, and demonstrate that these experiments
will be extremely useful in improving sensitivity to masses near $10^{-14}$ eV, potentially by
several orders of magnitude. Finally, we discuss implications for both reionization and early
star formation, and show that probes which are inherently sensitive to the inhomogeneous state
of the Universe could resolve signatures unique to the light dark photon dark matter scenario, and
thus offer a fantastic potential for a positive detection.
