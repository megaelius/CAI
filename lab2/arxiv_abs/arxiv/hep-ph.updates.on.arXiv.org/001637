In this review we present and discuss the determination of the magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) matrix parameter $V_{cb}$. The CKM matrix parametrizes the weak charged current interactions
of quarks in the Standard Model (SM), and a precise determination of its elements has always been
one of the most important targets of particle physics. The precise knowledge of the $|V_{cb}|$ value
plays a pivotal role in testing the flavour sector of the SM and in the analyses of the unitarity of
the CKM matrix. The SM does not predict the values of the CKM matrix elements, which have to be extracted
by experimental data. Given the variety of channels that allow the extraction of $|V_{cb}|$, different
theoretical and experimental techniques are mustered for the $|V_{cb}|$ determination. The exertion
toward precision represents not only a significant test of our theoretical procedures but a stimulus
towards better detection performances. The most precise measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ come from
semileptonic decays, that being tree level at the lowest order in the SM are generally considered
unaffected by physics beyond the SM. After summarizing the characteristics of the SM that set the
frame for the determination of $|V_{cb}|$, we discuss inclusive and exclusive semileptonic $B$
decays. We analyze the $|V_{cb}|$ extraction methods and recent results, detailing both the theoretical
and experimental techniques, and, finally, outline future prospects. We also comment on exclusive
decays into heavy leptons, on the observables $R(D)$ and $R(D^\ast)$, on decays to excited $D$ meson
states and on baryon decays.
