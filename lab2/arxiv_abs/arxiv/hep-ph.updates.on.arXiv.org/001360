The production of hidden-bottom pentaquark $P_{b}$ states via $\gamma p$ and $\pi ^{-}p$ scatterings
is studied within an effective Lagrangian approach and the vector-meson-dominance mechnism.
For the $P_{b}$ production in the process $\gamma p\rightarrow \Upsilon p$, the dipole Pomeron
model is employed to calculate the background contribution, and the experimental data can be well
described. For the process $\pi ^{-}p\rightarrow \Upsilon n$, the Reggeized $t$-channel with
$\pi $ exchange is considered as the main background for the $P_{b}$ production. Near the threshold,
two-peak structure from the states $P_{b (11080)$ and $P_{b}(11125)$ can be observed if energy
bin width is chosen as 0.01 GeV, and the same result is obtained in the $\pi ^{-}p$ scattering. Moreover,
by taking the branching ratio of Br$[{P_{b}\rightarrow \pi N}]\simeq 0.05\%$, the numerical result
shows that the average value of cross section from the $P_{b}(11080)$ state produced in the $\gamma
p$ or $\pi ^{-}p$ scattering reaches at least 0.1 nb with a bin of 0.1 GeV. Even if we reduce the branching
ratio of the $P_{b}$ state into $\pi N$ channel by one order, the theoretical average of the cross
section from $P_{b}(11080)$ production in $\pi ^{-}p$ scattering can reach the order of 0.01 nb
with a bin of 0.1 GeV, which means that the signal can still be clearly distinguished from the background.
The experimental measurements and studies on the hidden-bottom pentaquark $P_{b}$ state production
in the $\gamma p $ or $\pi ^{-}p$ scattering near-threshold energy region around $W\simeq 11$ GeV
are strongly suggested, which are accessible at COMPASS and JPARC. Particularly, the result of
the photoproduction suggests that it is very promising to observe the hidden-bottom pentaquark
at proposed EicC facility in China.
