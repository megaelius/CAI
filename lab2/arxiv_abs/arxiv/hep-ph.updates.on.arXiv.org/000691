Among the promising ideas that have emerged over the past decades, arguably the most beautiful and
far reaching is supersymmetry. The exclusion of more and more energy ranges at LHC is quite natural,
but, the exclusions of the simplest supersymmetric grand unified theories take the physicists
in quandary. However, in these calculations in literature, the whole spectrum in electroweak sector
is conventionally generated at a single renormalization group evolution scale, the geometric
mean of stop masses, at which the electroweak symmetry breaking potential is minimized. We first
find the spectrum inaccurate and it leads to a wrong conclusion due to the facts that i) in every renormalized
theory each physical quantity must be evaluated at its own renormalization scale, not all quantities
at a single scale, ii) the renormalization scales spreads over a few orders of magnitude of energy
due to the wide range of spectrum, and iii) moreover, above chosen conventional scale in literature
is few orders of magnitude higher than the highest scale in standard model spectrum. The simplest
supersymmetric grand unified theories like constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model
and non-universal gaugino mass model etc. seized out from measured branching ratio of $B_s^0 \to
\mu^+\mu^-$ at LHC become accessible when it is calculated at its correct renormalization scale.
On the other hand, from the study of $b\to s\gamma$ decay we show an evidence that if one calculates
the branching ratio at the above conventional scale or at a scale much higher than its actual renormalization
scale then the theory becomes invalid having same value of branching ratio for different sets of
input parameters.
