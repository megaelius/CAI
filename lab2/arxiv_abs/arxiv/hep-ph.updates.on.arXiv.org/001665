We suggest the gauge groups SU(3), SU(2) and U(1) to share a common origin in U(3). We take the Lie group
U(3) to serve as an intrinsic configuration space for baryons. A spontaneous symmetry break in the
baryonic state selects a U(2) subgroup for the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs field enters the symmetry
break to relate the strong and electroweak energy scales by exchange of one quantum of action between
the two sectors. This shapes the Higgs potential to fourth order. Recently intrinsic quantum mechanics
has given a suggestion for the Cabibbo angle from theory (EPL124-2018) and a prediction for the Higgs
couplings to gauge bosons (EPL125-2019). Previously it has given the nucleon mass and the parton
distribution functions for u and d quarks in the proton (EPL102-2013). It has given a quite accurate
equation for the Higgs mass in closed form (IJMPA30-2015) and an N and Delta spectrum essentially
without missing resonances (arXiv:1109.4732). The intrinsic space is to be distinguished from
an interior space. The intrinsic space is non-spatial, i.e. no gravity in intrinsic space. The configuration
variable is like a generalized spin variable excited from laboratory space by kinematic generators:
momentum, spin and Laplace-Runge-Lenz operators. The baryon dynamics resides in a Hamiltonian
on U(3) and projects to laboratory space by the momentum form of the wavefunction. The momentum form
generates conjugate quark and gluon fields. Local gauge invariance in laboratory space follows
from unitarity of the configuration variable and left invariance of the coordinate fields on the
intrinsic space. Future work should aim to invoke leptons in the second and third generations and
quarks in the third.
