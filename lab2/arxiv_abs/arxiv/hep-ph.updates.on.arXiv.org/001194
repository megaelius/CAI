The in-medium partial decay widths of $\Upsilon (4S) \rightarrow B\bar B$ in magnetized asymmetric
nuclear matter are studied using a field theoretic model for composite hadrons with quark/antiquark
constituents. The medium modifications of the decay widths of $\Upsilon (4S)$ to $B\bar B$ pair
in magnetized matter, arise due to the mass modifications of the decaying $\Upsilon (4S)$ as well
as of the produced $B$ and $\bar B$ mesons. The effects of the anomalous magnetic moments for the proton
and neutron are taken into consideration in the present investigation. The presence of the external
magnetic field is observed to lead to different mass modifications within the $B (B^+, B^0)$ as well
as the $\bar B (B^-, \bar {B^0})$ doublets, even in isospin symmetric nuclear matter, due to the difference
in the interactions of the proton and the neutron to the electromagnetic field. This leads to difference
in the upsilon decay widths to the neutral ($B^0 \bar {B^0}$) and the charged ($B^+ B^-$) pairs in
the magnetized symmetric nuclear matter. The isospin asymmetry is observed to lead to quite different
behaviours for the $\Upsilon (4S)$ decay widths to the charged and neutral $B\bar B$. In the presence
of the magnetic field, the Landau level contributions give rise to positive shifts in the masses
of the charged $B$ and $\bar B$ mesons. This leads to the decay of $\Upsilon(4S)$ to the charged $B^+
B^-$ to be suppressed as compared to the neutral $B\bar B$ pair, especially at low densities. This
may lead to suppression in the production of the charged $B^\pm$ mesons as compared to the neutral
$B^0$ and $\bar {B^0}$ mesons at LHC and RHIC.
