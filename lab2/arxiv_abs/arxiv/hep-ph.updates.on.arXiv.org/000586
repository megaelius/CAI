Recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration have shown that the composition of ultrahigh-energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs) becomes gradually heavier with increasing energy. Although gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) have been promising sources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the
Auger results because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this work, we revisit
the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the sources of UHECR nuclei, and give new
predictions based on the intrajet nuclear composition models considering progenitor dependencies.
We find that the nuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the mass fraction
of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the connection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic
supernovae, we also consider the hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability
of UHECR nuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is easier for nuclei
to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically propagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs
with different composition models and compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data.
Our results show that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the Auger data
well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in fitting the spectrum. We argue
that our model is consistent with the newly reported cross correlation between the UHECRs and starburst
galaxies, since both LL GRBs and hypernovae are expected to be tracers of the star-formation activity.
LL GRBs have also been suggested as the dominant origin of IceCube neutrinos in the PeV range, and
the LL GRB origin of UHECRs can be critically tested by near-future multimessenger observations.
