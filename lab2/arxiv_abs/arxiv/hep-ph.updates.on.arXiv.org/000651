The successful joint observation of the gravitational wave event GW170817 and its multi-wavelength
electromagnetic counterparts first enables human to witness a definite merger event of two neutron
stars (NSs). This historical event confirms the origin of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),
and in particular, identifies the theoretically-predicted kilonova phenomenon that is powered
by radioactive decays of $r$-process heavy elements. However, whether a long-lived remnant NS
could be formed during this merger event remains unknown, although such a central engine has been
suggested by afterglow observations of some short-duration GRBs. By invoking this long-lived
remnant NS, we here propose a model of hybrid energy sources for the kilonova AT2017gfo associated
with GW 170817. While the early emission of AT2017gfo is still powered radioactively as usually
suggested, its late emission is primarily caused by delayed energy injection from the remnant NS.
In our model, only one single opacity is required and an intermediate value of $\kappa\simeq0.97\,\rm
cm^2g^{-1}$ is revealed, which could be naturally provided by lanthanide-rich ejecta that is deeply
ionized by the emission from a wind of the NS. These self-consistent results indicate that a long-lived
remnant NS, which must own a very stiff equation of state, had been formed during the merger event
of GW170817. This provides a very stringent constraint on the strong interaction in nuclear-quark
matter. It is further implied that such GW events could provide a probe of the early spin and magnetic
evolutions of NSs, e.g., the burying of surface magnetic fields.
