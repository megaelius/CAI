A model for neutrino masses and mixing is devised appointing the see-saw mechanism. The proffered
model is fabricated with a combination of Type -I and Type-II see-saw contributions of which the
latter dominates. The scalars and the leptons in the model are assigned $A4$ charges conducive to
obtain the mass matrices viable for the scheme. The Type -II see-saw mass matrix accommodates atmospheric
mass splitting and maximal mixing in the atmospheric sector ($\theta_{23}=\pi/4$). It is characterized
by vanishing solar mass splitting and $\theta_{13}$ whereas the third neutrino mixing angle is
free to acquire any value of $\theta_{12}^0$. Particular alternatives of $\theta_{12}^0$ corresponding
to the popular lepton mixings viz. $\theta_{12}^0=35.3^\circ$ (tribimaximal), $45.0^\circ$
(bimaximal), $31.7^\circ$ (golden ratio) are accounted for. Another choice of $\theta_{12}^0=0^\circ$
(no solar mixing) is reckoned. The subdominant Type-I see-saw constituent of the model propels
all the neutrino oscillation parameters into the ranges allowed by the data which in its turn get
interrelated owing to their common origin. This makes the model testable in the light of future experimental
data. As an example, $\theta_{23}$ emerges in the first (second) octant for normal (inverted) ordering.
CP-violation is governed by phases present in the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix,
$M_{\nu R}$. Only normal ordering is allowed if these phases are absent. If $M_{\nu R}$ is complex
the Dirac CP-violating phase $\delta$, is capable of being large, i.e., $\sim \pm \pi/2$, and inverted
ordering of neutrino masses is also permitted. T2K and NOVA preliminary data favouring normal ordering
and $\delta \sim -\pi/2$ predicts lightest neutrino mass to be 0.05 eV or more within the framework
of this model.
