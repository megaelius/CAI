At the earliest times after a heavy-ion collision, the magnetic field created by the spectator nucleons
will generate an extremely strong, albeit rapidly decreasing in time, magnetic field. The impact
of this magnetic field may have detectable consequences, and is believed to drive anomalous transport
effects like the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). We detail an exploratory study on the effects of a
dynamical magnetic field on the hydrodynamic medium created in the collisions of two ultrarelativistic
heavy-ions, using the framework of numerical ideal MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) with the ECHO-QGP
code. In this study, we consider a magnetic field captured in a conducting medium, where the conductivity
can receive contributions from the electromagnetic conductivity $\sigma$ and the chiral magnetic
conductivity $\sigma_{\chi}$. We first study the elliptic flow of pions, which we show is relatively
unchanged by the introduction of a magnetic field. However, by increasing the magnitude of the magnetic
field, we find evidence for an enhancement of the elliptic flow in peripheral collisions. Next,
we explore the impact of the chiral magnetic conductivity on electric charges produced at the edges
of the fireball. This initial $\sigma_\chi$ can be understood as a long-wavelength effective description
of chiral fermion production. We then demonstrate that this chiral charge, when transported by
the MHD medium, produces a charge dipole perpendicular to the reaction plane which extends a few
units in rapidity. Assuming charge conservation at the freeze-out surface, we show that the produced
charge imbalance can have measurable effects on some experimental observables, like $v_1$ or $\langle
\sin \phi \rangle$. This demonstrates the ability of a MHD fluid to transport the signature of the
initial chiral magnetic fields to late times.
