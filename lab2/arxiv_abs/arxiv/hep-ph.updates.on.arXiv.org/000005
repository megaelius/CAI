Many beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios involve Higgs couplings to additional electroweak
fields. It is well established that these new fields may modify Higgs gamma-gamma and gamma-Z decays
at one-loop. However, one unexplored aspect of such scenarios is that by electroweak symmetry one
should also expect modifications to the Higgs Z-Z coupling at one-loop and, more generally, modifications
to Higgs production and decay channels beyond tree-level. In this paper we investigate the full
BSM modified electroweak corrections to associated Higgs production at both the LHC and a future
lepton collider in two simple SM extensions. From both inclusive and differential NLO associated
production cross sections we find BSM-NLO corrections can be as large as O(>10%) when compared
to the SM expectation, consistent with other precision electroweak measurements, even in scenarios
where modifications to the Higgs diphoton rate are not significant. At the LHC such corrections
are comparable to the involved QCD uncertainties. At a lepton collider the Higgs associated production
cross section can be measured to high accuracy (O(1%) independent of uncertainties in total width
and other couplings), and such a deviation could be easily observed even if the new states remain
beyond kinematic reach. This should be compared to the expected accuracy for a model-independent
determination of the Higgs diphoton coupling at a lepton collider, which is O(15%). This work demonstrates
that precision measurements of the Higgs associated production cross section constitute a powerful
probe of modified Higgs sectors and will be valuable for indirectly exploring BSM scenarios.
