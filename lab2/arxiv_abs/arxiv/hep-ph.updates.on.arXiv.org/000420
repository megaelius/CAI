In the present work we study the production of vector resonances at the LHC by means of the vector boson
scattering $WZ \to WZ$ and explore the sensitivities to these resonances for the expected future
LHC luminosities. We are assuming that these vector resonances are generated dynamically from
the self interactions of the longitudinal gauge bosons, $W_L$ and $Z_L$, and work under the framework
of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian to describe in a model independent way the supposedly strong
dynamics of these modes. The properties of the vector resonances, mass, width and couplings to the
$W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons are derived from the inverse amplitude method approach. We implement all
these features into a single model, the IAM-MC, adapted for MonteCarlo, built in a Lagrangian language
in terms of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian and a chiral Lagrangian for the vector resonances,
which mimics the resonant behavior of the IAM and provides unitary amplitudes. The model has been
implemented in MadGraph, allowing us to perform a realistic study of the signal versus background
events at the LHC. In particular, we have focused our study on the $pp\to WZjj$ type of events, discussing
first on the potential of the hadronic and semileptonic channels of the final $WZ$, and next exploring
in more detail the clearest signals. These are provided by the leptonic decays of the gauge bosons,
leading to a final state with $\ell_1^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^+\nu jj$, $\ell=e,\mu$, having a very distinctive
signature, and showing clearly the emergence of the resonances with masses in the range of 1.5-2.5
TeV, which we have explored.
