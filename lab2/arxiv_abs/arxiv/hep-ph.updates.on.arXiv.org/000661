We consider the central exclusive production of the $p\bar{p}$ in the continuum and via resonances
in proton-proton collisions at high energies. We discuss the diffractive mechanism calculated
within the tensor-pomeron approach including pomeron, odderon, and reggeon exchanges. The theoretical
results are discussed in the context of existing WA102 and ISR experimental data and predictions
for planned or current experiments at the RHIC and the LHC are presented. The distribution in ${\rm
y}_{diff}$, the rapidity distance between proton and antiproton, is particularly interesting.
We find a dip at ${\rm y}_{diff} = 0$ for the $p \bar{p}$ production, in contrast to the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$
and $K^{+}K^{-}$ production. We predict also the $p \bar{p}$ invariant mass distribution to be
less steep than for the pairs of pseudoscalar mesons. We argue that these specific differences for
the $p \bar{p}$ production with respect to the pseudoscalar meson pair production can be attributed
to the proper treatment of the spin of produced particles. We discuss asymmetries that are due to
the interference of $C=+1$ and $C=-1$ amplitudes of $p \bar{p}$ production. We have also calculated
the cross section for the $pp \to pp \Lambda \overline{\Lambda}$ reaction. Here, the cross section
is smaller but the characteristic feature for $d\sigma/d{\rm y}_{diff}$ is predicted to be similar
to $p \bar{p}$ production. The presence of resonances in the $p \bar p$ channel may destroy the dip
at ${\rm y}_{diff} = 0$. This opens the possibility to study diffractively produced resonances.
We discuss the observables suited for this purpose.
