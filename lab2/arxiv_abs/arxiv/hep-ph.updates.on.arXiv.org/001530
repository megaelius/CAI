This paper presents a non-Hermitian PT-symmetric extension of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL)
model of quantum chromodynamics in 3+1 and 1+1 dimensions. In 3+1 dimensions, the SU(2)-symmetric
NJL Hamiltonian $H_{\textrm{NJL}} = \bar\psi (-i \gamma^k \partial_k + m_0) \psi - G [ (\bar\psi
\psi)^2 + (\bar\psi i \gamma_5 \vec{\tau} \psi)^2 ]$ is extended by the non-Hermitian, PT- and chiral-symmetric
bilinear term $ig\bar\psi \gamma_5 B_{\mu} \gamma^{\mu} \psi$; in 1+1 dimensions, where $H_{\textrm{NJL}}$
is a form of the Gross-Neveu model, it is extended by the non-Hermitian PT-symmetric but chiral symmetry
breaking term $g \bar\psi \gamma_5 \psi$. In each case, the gap equation is derived and the effects
of the non-Hermitian terms on the generated mass are studied. We have several findings: in previous
calculations for the free Dirac equation modified to include non-Hermitian bilinear terms, contrary
to expectation, no real mass spectrum can be obtained in the chiral limit; in these cases a nonzero
bare fermion mass is essential for the realization of PT symmetry in the unbroken regime. Here, in
the NJL model, in which four-point interactions are present, we {\it do} find real values for the
mass spectrum also in the limit of vanishing bare masses in both 3+1 and 1+1 dimensions, at least for
certain specific values of the non-Hermitian couplings $g$. Thus, the four-point interaction
overrides the effects leading to PT symmetry-breaking for these parameter values. Further, we
find that in both cases, in 3+1 and in 1+1 dimensions, the inclusion of a non-Hermitian bilinear term
can contribute to the generated mass. In both models, this contribution can be tuned to be small;
we thus fix the fermion mass to its value when $m_0=0$ in the absence of the non-Hermitian term, and
then determine the value of the coupling required so as to generate a bare fermion mass.
