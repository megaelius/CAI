We study the impact of perturbative reheating on primordial observables in models of multiple-field
inflation. By performing a sudden decay calculation, we derive analytic expressions for the local-type
non-linearity parameter $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}$, the scalar spectral index $n_\zeta$, and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_T$ as functions of the decay rates of the inflationary fields. We compare
our analytic results to a fully numerical classical field theory simulation, finding excellent
agreement. We find that the sensitivity of $f_{\rm NL}$, $n_\zeta$, and $r_T$ to the reheating phase
depends heavily on the underlying inflationary model. We quantify this sensitivity, and discuss
conditions that must be satisfied if observable predictions are to be insensitive to the dynamics
of reheating. We demonstrate that upon completion of reheating, all observable quantities take
values within finite ranges, the limits of which are determined completely by the conditions during
inflation. Furthermore, fluctuations in both fields play an important role in determining the
full dependence of the observables on the dynamics of reheating. By applying our formalism to two
concrete examples, we demonstrate that variations in $f_{\rm NL}$, $n_\zeta$, and $r_T$ caused
by changes in reheating dynamics are well within the sensitivity of Planck, and as such the impact
of reheating must be accounted for when making predictions for models of multiple-field inflation.
Our final expressions are very general, encompassing a wide range of two-field inflationary models,
including the standard curvaton scenario. Our results allow a much more unified approach to studying
two-field inflation including the effects of perturbative reheating. As such, entire classes
of models can be studied together, allowing a more systematic approach to gaining insight into the
physics of the early universe through observation.
