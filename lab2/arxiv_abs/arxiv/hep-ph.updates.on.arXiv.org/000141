In this review, we discuss various properties of topological solitons in dense QCD matter, with
a particular emphasis on the CFL phase exhibiting superfluidity and superconductivity, and their
phenomenological implications in terms of the effective field theories such as the Ginzburg-Landau
theory, the chiral Lagrangian, or the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equation. The most fundamental topological
excitations are non-Abelian vortices, which are 1/3 quantized superfluid vortices and color magnetic
flux tubes. They are created at a phase transition or a rotation such compact stars. The intervortex-interaction
is repulsive and consequently a vortex lattice is formed. Bosonic and fermionic zero-energy modes
are trapped in the vortex core and propagate along it as gapless excitations. The former consists
of translational zero modes (a Kelvin mode) with a quadratic dispersion and CP(2) Nambu-Goldstone
gapless modes with a linear dispersion, while the latter is the triplet Majorana fermion zero modes.
The low-energy effective theory of the bosonic zero modes is a non-relativistic free complex scalar
field and a CP(2) model in 1+1 dimensions. The effects of strange quark mass, electromagnetic interactions
and non-perturbative quantum corrections are taken into account. Colorful boojums at the CFL interface,
quantum color magnetic monopole confined by vortices, which supports the notion of quark-hadron
duality, and Yang-Mills instantons inside a vortex as lumps are discussed. The interactions between
a vortex and quasi-particles such as phonons, gluons, mesons, and photons are studied. A vortex
lattice is shown to behave as a cosmic polarizer. Non-Abelian vortices are shown to behave as a novel
kind of non-Abelian anyons. For the chiral symmetry breaking, we discuss fractional and integer
axial domain walls, Abelian and non-Abelian axial vortices, axial wall-vortex composites, and
Skyrmions.
