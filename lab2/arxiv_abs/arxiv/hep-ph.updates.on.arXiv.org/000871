In this work, within the QCD factorization approach, we study the localized integrated $CP$ violation
in the $B^-\rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decay and the branching fraction of the $B^-\rightarrow\sigma\pi^-$
decay. Both the resonance and nonresonance contributions are included when we study the localized
$CP$ asymmetry in the $B^-\rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decay. The resonance contributions from
the scalar $\sigma(600)$ and vector $\rho^0(770)$ mesons are included. For the $\sigma(600)$
meson, we apply both the Breit-Wigner and Bugg models to deal with its propagator, and obtain $\mathcal{B}(B^-\rightarrow
\sigma(600)\pi^-)<1.67\times10^{-6}$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^-\rightarrow \sigma(600) \pi^-)<1.946\times10^{-5}$
in these two models, respectively. We find that there is no allowed divergence parameters $\rho_S$
and $\phi_S$ to satisfy the experimental data $\mathcal{A_{CP}}(\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-)=0.584\pm0.082\pm0.027\pm0.007$
in the region $m_{\pi^+\pi^- \mathrm{high}}^2>15$ $\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and $m_{\pi^+\pi^-\mathrm{low}}^2<0.4$
$\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and the upper limit of $\mathcal{B}(B^-\rightarrow \sigma(600)\pi^-)$ in
the Breit-Wigner model, however, there exists the region $\rho_S\in[1.70,3.34]$ and $\phi_S
\in [0.50,4.50]$ satisfying the data for $\mathcal{A_{CP}}(\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-)$ and the upper
limit of $\mathcal{B}(B^-\rightarrow \sigma(600)\pi^-)$ in the Bugg model. This reveals that
the Bugg model is more plausible than the Breit-Wigner model to describe the propagator of the $\sigma(600)$
meson even though the finite width effects are considered in both models. The large values of $\rho_S$
indicate that the contributions from weak annihilation and hard spectator scattering processes
are both large, especially, the weak annihilation contribution should not be negleted for $B$ decays
to final states including a scalar meson.
