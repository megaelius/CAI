We present results of a lattice calculation of tetraquark states with quark contents $q_1q_2\bar{Q}\bar{Q},
\, q_1,q_2 \subset u,d,s,c$ and $Q \equiv b,c$ in both spin zero ($J=0$) and spin one ($J=1$) sectors.
These calculations are performed on three dynamical $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ highly improved staggered quark
ensembles at lattice spacings of about 0.12, 0.09 and 0.06 fm. We use the overlap action for light
to charm quarks while a non-relativistic action with non-perturbatively improved coefficients
with terms up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s v^4)$ is employed for the bottom quark. While considering
two heavy quarks as charm or bottom, we calculate the energy levels of various four-quark configurations
with light quark masses ranging from the physical strange quark mass to that of the corresponding
physical pion mass. Results for the spin one states show the presence of ground state energy levels
which are below their respective thresholds for all the light flavor combinations with both doubly
heavy quarks and particularly for the bottom quarks. Further, we identify a trend that the energy
splittings, defined as the energy difference between the ground state energy levels and their respective
thresholds, increase with decreasing the light quark masses and are maximum at the physical point
for all the spin one states. The rate of increase is however dependent on the light quark configuration
of the particular spin one state. We also present a study of hadron mass relations involving tetraquarks,
baryons and mesons arising in the limit of infinitely heavy quark and find that these relations are
more compatible with the heavy quark limit in the bottom sector but deviate substantially in the
charm sector. The ground state spectra of the spin zero tetraquark states with various flavor combinations
are seen to lie above their respective thresholds.
