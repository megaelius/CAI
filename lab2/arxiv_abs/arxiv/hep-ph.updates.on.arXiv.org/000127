We investigate how the 331 models face new data on B_{s,d}->mu^+mu^- and B_d->K^*mu^+mu^-
taking into account present constraints from Delta F=2 observables, low energy precision measurements,
LEP-II and the LHC data. In these models new flavour violating interactions of ordinary quarks and
leptons are dominated by a new heavy Z^prime gauge boson with the strength of the relevant couplings
governed by four new parameters in the quark sector and the parameter beta. We study the implications
of these models for beta=+-n/sqrt{3} with n=1,2,3. The case beta=-sqrt{3} leading to Landau singularities
for M_{Z'}approx 4Tev can be ruled out when the present constraints on Z^prime couplings, in particular
from LEP-II, are taken into account. For n=1,2 interesting results are found for M_{Z^prime}<
4Tev with largest NP effects for beta<0 in B_d->K^*mu^+mu^- and the ones in B_{s,d}->mu^+mu^-
for beta>0. As Re(C_9^NP) can reach the values -0.8 and -0.4 for n=2 and n=1, respectively the
B_d-> K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies can be softened with the size depending on Delta M_s/(Delta M_s)_SM
and the CP-asymmetry S_{psiphi}. A correlation between Re(C_9^NP) and BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-),
identified for beta<0, implies for negative Re(C_9^NP) uniquely suppression of BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-)
relative to its SM value which is favoured by the data. In turn also S_{psiphi}< S_{psiphi}^SM
is favoured having dominantly opposite sign to S_{psiphi}^SM. We find that the absence of B_d->
K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies in the future data and confirmation of the suppression of BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-)
relative to its SM value would favour beta=1/sqrt{3} and M_{Z'}approx 3Tev. Assuming lepton universality,
we find an upper bound |C_9^NP|<1.1(1.4) from LEP-II data for all Z' models with only left-handed
flavour violating couplings to quarks when NP contributions to Delta M_s at the level of 10%(15%)
are allowed.
