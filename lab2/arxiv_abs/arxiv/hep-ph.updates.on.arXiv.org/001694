The unitarily extended Bialas-Bzdak model of elastic proton-proton scattering is applied, without
modifications, to describe the differential cross-section of elastic proton-antiproton collisions
in the TeV energy range, and to extrapolate these differential cross-sections to LHC energies.
In this model-dependent study we find that the differential cross-sections of elastic proton-proton
collision data at 2.76 and 7 TeV energies differ significantly from the differential cross-section
of elastic proton antiproton collisions extrapolated to these energies. The difference is larger
than the theoretical error on these extrapolations. On the other hand, the elastic proton-proton
differential cross-sections, extrapolated to 1.96 TeV energy with the help of this extended Bialas-Bzdak
model do not differ significantly from that of elastic proton-antiproton collisions at this particular
energy, within the theoretical errors of the extrapolation. Taken together these results provide
a model-dependent, but statistically significant evidence for a crossing-odd component of the
elastic scattering amplitude. Obtained from the comparison of the extrapolated $p\bar p$ elastic
differential cross-section to measured $pp$ data at $\sqrt{s} = 2.76 $ TeV, within this model and
in the $ 0.372 \leq -t \leq 0.74$ range, the probability of Odderon observation is $P = 1 - CL \geq 0.99999999999891$,
corresponding to a confidence level $ CL \leq 1.09 \times 10^{-12}$ and to an at least 7.1 $\sigma$
statistical significance. Compared to these values, the extrapolation of $p\bar p$ differential
cross-section up to $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV results in an even larger model dependent significance and
observation probability of Odderon effects. From the reconstructed Odderon and Pomeron amplitudes,
we determine the $\sqrt{s}$ dependence of the correspondig total and differential cross-sections.
