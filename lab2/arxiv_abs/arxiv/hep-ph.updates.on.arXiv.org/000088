The Impact-Parameter dependent Color Glass Condensate (b-CGC) dipole model is based on the Balitsky-Kovchegov
non-linear evolution equation and improves the Iancu-Itakura-Munier dipole model by incorporating
the impact-parameter dependence of the saturation scale. Here we confront the model to the recently
released high precision combined HERA data and obtain its parameters. The b-CGC results are then
compared to data at small-x for the structure function, the longitudinal structure function, the
charm structure function, exclusive vector meson (J/\psi, \phi, \rho) production and Deeply Virtual
Compton Scattering (DVCS). We also compare our results with the Impact-Parameter dependent Saturation
model (IP-Sat). We show that most features of inclusive DIS and exclusive diffractive data, including
the Q^2, W, |t| and x dependence are correctly reproduced in both models. Nevertheless, the b-CGC
and the IP-Sat models give different predictions beyond the current HERA kinematics, namely for
the structure functions at very low x and high virtualities Q^2, and for the exclusive diffractive
vector meson and DVCS production at high t. This can be traced back to the different power-law behavior
of the saturation scale in x, and to a different impact-parameter b dependence of the saturation
scale in these models. Nevertheless, both models give approximately similar saturation scale
Q_S<1 GeV for the proton in HERA kinematics, and also both models lead to the same conclusion that
the typical impact-parameter probed in the total \gamma^{*}p cross-section is about b\approx
2\div 3 GeV^{-1}. Our results provide a benchmark for further investigation of QCD at small-x in
heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC and also at future experiments such as an Electron-Ion Collider
and the LHeC.
