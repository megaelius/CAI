All pieces of concrete evidence for phenomena outside the standard model (SM) - neutrino masses
and dark matter - are consistent with the existence of new degrees of freedom that interact very weakly,
if at all, with those in the SM. We propose that these new degrees of freedom organize themselves into
a simple dark sector, a chiral SU(3) x SU(2) gauge theory with the smallest nontrivial fermion content.
Similar to the SM, the dark SU(2) is spontaneously broken while the dark SU(3) confines at low energies.
At the renormalizable level, the dark sector contains massless fermions - dark leptons - and stable
massive particles - dark protons. We find that dark protons with masses between 10-100 TeV satisfy
all current cosmological and astrophysical observations concerning dark matter even if dark protons
are a symmetric thermal relic. The dark leptons play the role of right-handed neutrinos and allow
simple realizations of the seesaw mechanism or the possibility that neutrinos are Dirac fermions.
In the latter case, neutrino masses are also parametrically different from charged-fermion masses
and the lightest neutrino is predicted to be massless. Since the new "neutrino" and "dark matter"
degrees of freedom interact with one another, these two new-physics phenomena are intertwined.
Dark leptons play a nontrivial role in early universe cosmology while indirect searches for dark
matter involve, decisively, dark matter annihilations into dark leptons. These, in turn, may lead
to observable signatures at high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray observatories, especially once
one accounts for the potential Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross-section, derived
from the low-energy dark-sector effective theory, a possibility we explore quantitatively in
some detail.
