A brief review of the string percolation model and its results are presented together with the comparison
to experimental data. First, it is done an introduction to the quark-gluon phase diagram and the
lattice results concerning the confinement and the percolation of center domains. It is studied
the interaction of the strings produced in nucleus-nucleus and proton-proton collisions showing
how the string percolation arises. The main consequences of the string percolation, concerning
the dependence on the energy and centrality, on the multiplicities and the mean transverse momentum
are obtained comparing with experimental data. It is emphasized the non-abelian character of the
color field of the strings forming the cluster to reproduce the rise of the transverse momentum with
multiplicity and the relative suppression of multiplicities. It is also studied different observables
like multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions, dependence with multiplicity and transverse
momentum correlations, forward-backward correlations, the strength of the Bose-Einstein correlations,
dependence on the multiplicity of $J/\Psi$ production and its possible suppression in pp collisions
at high multiplicity, strangeness enhancement, elliptic flow, and ridge structure. The comparison
with the data shows an overall agreement. The thermodynamical properties of the extended cluster
formed in the collision are discussed computing its energy and entropy density, shear viscosity
over entropy density ratio, bulk viscosity, sound speed and trace anomaly as a function of temperature,
showing a remarkable agreement with lattice QCD evaluations. The string percolation can be regarded
as the initial frame able to describe the collective behavior produced in AA and pp collisions.
