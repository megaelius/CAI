The nucleon resonances are investigated within a dynamical coupled-channels model of pi N and gamma
N reactions up to the invariant mass W = 2 GeV. The meson-baryon (MB) channels included in the calculations
are MB = pi N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma, and pi pi N that has pi Delta, rho N, and sigma N resonant components.
The meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) are calculated from solving a set of coupled-channels
integral equations defined by an interaction Hamiltonian consisting of (a) meson-exchange interactions
v_{MB,M'B'} derived from phenomenological Lagrangian, and (b) vertex interactions N* -->
MB for describing the transition of a baryon B to a bare excited nucleon state N*. The parameters of
v_{MB,M'B'} are mainly constrained by the fit to the data of pi N --> pi N in the low energy region
up to W =1.4 GeV. The bare masses of N* and the N* --> MB parameters are then determined in simultaneous
fits to the data of pi N --> pi N up to W =2.3 GeV and those of pi N --> eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma and gamma
N --> pi N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma up to W = 2.1 GeV. The pole positions and residues of nucleon resonances
are extracted by analytically continuing the meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) to the complex
Riemann energy surface. From the extracted residues, we have determined the N* --> pi N, gamma
N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma transition amplitudes at resonance poles. We compare the resonance pole
positions from our analysis with those given by Particle Data Group and the recent coupled-channels
analyses by the Juelich and Bonn-Gatchina groups. Four results agree well only for the first N* in
each spin-parity-isospin (J^P,I) channel. For higher mass states, the number of states and their
resonance positions from four results do not agree well. We discuss the possible sources of the discrepancies
and the need of additional data from new hadron facilities such as J-PARC.
