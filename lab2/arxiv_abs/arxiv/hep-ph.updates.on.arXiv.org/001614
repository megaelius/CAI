In this work, we investigate the constraints on the total neutrino mass in the scenario of vacuum
energy interacting with cold dark matter (abbreviated as I$\Lambda$CDM) by using the latest cosmological
observations. We consider four typical interaction forms, i.e., $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, $Q=\beta
H \rho_{\rm c}$, $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm de}$, and $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm c}$, in the I$\Lambda$CDM
scenario. To avoid the large-scale instability problem in interacting dark energy models, we employ
the extended parameterized post-Friedmann method for interacting dark energy to calculate the
perturbation evolution of dark energy in these models. The observational data used in this work
include the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements from the Planck 2018 data release,
the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, the type Ia supernovae (SN) observation (Pantheon
compilation), and the 2019 local distance ladder measurement of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$ from
the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that, compared with those in the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$
model, the constrains on $\sum m_{\nu}$ are looser in the four I$\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$ models.
When considering the three mass hierarchies of neutrinos, the constraints on $\sum m_{\nu}$ are
tightest in the degenerate hierarchy case and loosest in the inverted hierarchy case. In addition,
in the four I$\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$ models, the values of coupling parameter $\beta$ are
larger using the CMB+BAO+SN+$H_{0}$ data combination than that using the CMB+BAO+SN data combination,
and $\beta>0$ is favored at more than 1$\sigma$ level when using CMB+BAO+SN+$H_{0}$ data combination.
The issue of the $H_{0}$ tension is also discussed in this paper. We find that, compared with the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum
m_{\nu}$ model, the $H_{0}$ tension can be alleviated in the I$\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$ model
to some extent.
