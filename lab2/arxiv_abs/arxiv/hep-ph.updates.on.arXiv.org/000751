The measurements of $R_K^{(*)}$ and $R_{D}^{(*)}$ by BaBar, Belle and the LHCb collaborations
could be showing a hint of lepton flavor universality violation that can be accommodated by the presence
of suitable leptoquarks at the TeV scale. We consider an effective description, with leptoquarks
arising as composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons as well as anarchic partial compositeness
of the SM fermions. Within this framework we study pair production of $S_3\sim(\bar 3,3)_{1/3}$
at the LHC. We focus on the component $S_3^{1/3}$ of the triplet, which decays predominantly to $t\tau$
and $b\nu$, and to $t\mu$ to a smaller extent, and study the bounds from existing searches at $\sqrt{s}=13$
TeV at the LHC. We find that sbottom searches in the $b\bar{b}+$MET final state best explore the region
in parameter space preferred by our model and currently exclude $S_3^{1/3}$ masses up to $\sim$1
TeV. Additional searches, considering the $t\tau$ and $t\mu$ decay modes, are required to probe
the full physical parameter space. In this paper we also recast existing searches for stops in $B-L$
$R$-parity violating scenarios and searches for SM 4-tops, and obtain the regions in parameter
space currently excluded. Practically the whole physical parameter space is currently excluded
for masses up to $\sim$0.8 TeV, which could be extended up to $\sim$1 TeV with the full Run 3 dataset.
We conclude that pair production searches for this leptoquark can benefit from considering the
final state $t \tau b +$MET, where the largest branching ratio is expected. We appraise that future
explorations of leptoquarks explaining the B-anomalies with masses beyond the TeV should also
consider single and non-resonant production in order to extend the mass reach.
