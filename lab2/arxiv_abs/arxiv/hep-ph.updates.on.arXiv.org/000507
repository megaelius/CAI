Studies of the nucleon resonance electroexcitation amplitudes in a wide range of photon virtualities
offer unique information on many facets of strong QCD behind the generation of all prominent excited
nucleon states. Advances in the evaluation of resonance electroexcitation amplitudes from the
data measured with the CLAS detector and the future extension of these studies with the CLAS12 detector
at Jefferson Lab are presented. For the first time, analyses of $\pi^0p$, $\pi^+n$, $\eta p$, and
$\pi^+\pi^-p$ electroproduction off proton channels have provided electroexcitation amplitudes
of most resonances in the mass range up to 1.8 GeV and at photon virtualities $Q^2 < 5$~GeV$^2$.Studies
of the resonance electroexcitation amplitudes revealed the $N^*$ structure as a complex interplay
between the inner core of three dressed quarks and the external meson-baryon cloud. The successful
description of the $\Delta(1232)3/2^+$ and $N(1440)1/2^+$ electrocouplings achieved within
the Dyson-Schwinger Equation approach under a traceable connection to the QCD Lagrangian and supported
by the novel light front quark model demonstrated the relevance of dressed quarks with dynamically
generated masses as an active structural component in baryons. Future experiments with the CLAS12
detector will offer insight into the structure of all prominent resonances at the highest photon
virtualities, $Q^2 < 12$~GeV$^2$, ever achieved in exclusive reactions, thus addressing the most
challenging problems of the Standard Model on the nature of hadron mass, quark-gluon confinement,
and the emergence of nucleon resonance structures from QCD. A search for new states of hadronic matter,
the so-called hybrid-baryons with glue as a structural component, will complete the long term efforts
on the resonance spectrum exploration.
