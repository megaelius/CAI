We analyze the prospects of observing the light CP-even neutral Higgs bosons ($h_1$) in their decays
into $b \bar b$ quarks, in the neutral and charged current production processes $e h_1 q$ and $\nu
h_1 q$ at the upcoming LHeC, with $\sqrt s \approx 1.296$ TeV. Assuming that the intermediate Higgs
boson ($h_2$) is Standard Model (SM)-like, we study the Higgs production within the framework of
NMSSM. We consider the constraints from Dark-matter, Sparticle masses, and the Higgs boson data.
The signal in our analysis can be classified as three jets, with electron (missing energy)coming
from the neutral (charged) current interaction. We demand that the number of b-tagged jets in the
central rapidity region be greater or equal to two. The remaining jet is tagged in the forward regions.
With this forward jet and two $b$-tagged jets in the central region, we reconstructed three jets
invariant masses. Applying some lower limits on these invariant masses turns out to be an essential
criterion to enhance the signal--to--background rates, with slightly different sets of kinematical
selections in the two different channels. We consider almost all reducible and irreducible SM background
processes. We find that the non-SM like Higgs boson, $h_1$, would be accessible in some of the NMSSM
benchmark points, at approximately 0.4$\sigma$ (2.5$\sigma$) level in the $e$+3j channel up to
Higgs boson masses of 75 GeV and in the $E\!\!\!\!/_T$+3j channel could be discovered with 1.7$\sigma$
(2.4$\sigma$) level up to Higgs boson masses of 88 GeV with 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data in a simple cut-based
(with optimization) selection. With ten times more data accumulation at the end of the LHeC run and
using optimization, one can have 5$\sigma$ discovery in the electron (missing energy) channel
up to 85 (more than 90) GeV.
