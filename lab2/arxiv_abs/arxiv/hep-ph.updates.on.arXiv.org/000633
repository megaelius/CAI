We perform a systematic study on the decorrelation of anisotropic flows along the pseudorapidity
in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC energies. The dynamical evolution of the
QGP fireball is simulated via the CLVisc (ideal) (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics model, with
the fully fluctuating initial condition from A-Multi-Phase-Transport (AMPT) model. Detailed
analysis is performed on the longitudinal decorrelations of elliptic, triangular and quadrangular
flows in terms of flow vectors, flow magnitudes and flow orientations (event planes). It is found
that pure flow magnitudes have smaller longitudinal decorrelation than pure flow orientations,
and the decorrelation of flow vectors is a combined effect of both flow magnitudes and orientations.
The longitudinal decorrelation of elliptic flow has a strong and non-monotonic centrality dependence
due to the initial elliptic collision geometry: smallest decorrelation in mid-central collisions.
In contrast, the decorrelations of triangular and quadrangular flows have weak centrality dependence,
slightly larger decorrelations in more peripheral collisions. Our numerical results for Pb+Pb
collisions at the LHC are in good agreement with the ATLAS data, while our RHIC results predict much
larger longitudinal decorrelations as compared to the LHC. We further analyze the longitudinal
structures of the AMPT initial conditions and find that the final-state longitudinal decorrelation
effects are strongly correlated with the lengths of the initial string structures in the AMPT model.
The decorrelation effects are typically larger at lower collision energies and in more peripheral
collisions due to shorter lengths of the string structures in the initial states.
