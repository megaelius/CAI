The Higgs pair production in gluon fusion is a sensitive probe of beyond-Standard Model (BSM) phenomena
and its detection is a major goal for the LHC and higher energy hadron collider experiments. In this
work we reanalyze the possible modifications of the Higgs pair production cross section within
low energy supersymmetry models. We show that the supersymmetric contributions to the Higgs pair
production cross section are strongly correlated with the ones of the single Higgs production in
the gluon fusion channel. Motivated by the analysis of ATLAS and CMS Higgs production data, which
allows moderate deviations of the Higgs coupling to gluons with respect to its Standard Model (SM)
value, we show that the Higgs pair production may be significantly increased with respect to the
SM predictions. In addition, the scalar superpartner's contribution may lead to significant modification
of the di-Higgs invariant mass distribution with respect to the SM predictions. These contributions,
however, become small for values of the lightest scalar top-quark (stop) mass significantly above
the weak scale and for small values of the stop mixing parameter. They are therefore constrained
by the experimental lower stop mass bound and the vacuum stability constraints. We also analyze
the combined effects on the di-Higgs production rate of a modification of the Higgs trilinear and
top-quark Yukawa couplings in the presence of light stops. In particular, we show that due to the
destructive interference of the triangle and box amplitude contributions to the di-Higgs production
cross section, even a small modification of the top-quark Yukawa coupling can lead to a significant
increase of the di-Higgs production rate.
