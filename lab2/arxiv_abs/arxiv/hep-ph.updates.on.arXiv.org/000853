A theory of two-pion photo- and electroproduction off the nucleon is derived considering all explicit
three-body mechanisms of the interacting $\pi\pi N$ system. The full three-body dynamics of the
interacting $\pi\pi N$ system is accounted for by the Faddeev-type ordering structure of the Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas
equations. The formulation is valid for hadronic two-point and three-point functions dressed
by arbitrary internal mechanisms provided all associated electromagnetic currents are constructed
to satisfy their respective (generalized) Ward-Takahashi identities. It is shown that coupling
the photon to the Faddeev structure of the underlying hadronic two-pion production mechanisms
results in a natural expansion of the full two-pion photoproduction current $M_{\pi\pi}^\mu$
in terms of multiple dressed loops involving two-body subsystem scattering amplitudes of the $\pi\pi
N$ system that preserves gauge invariance as a matter of course order by order in the number of (dressed)
loops. A closed-form expression is presented for the entire gauge-invariant current $M_{\pi\pi}^\mu$
with complete three-body dynamics. Individually gauge-invariant truncations of the full dynamics
most relevant for practical applications at the no-loop, one-loop, and two-loop levels are discussed
in detail. An approximation scheme to the full two-pion amplitude for calculational purposes is
also presented. It approximates, systematically, the full amplitude to any desired order of expansion
in the underlying hadronic two-body amplitude. Moreover, it allows for the approximate incorporation
of all neglected higher-order mechanisms in terms of a phenomenological remainder current. The
effect and phenomenological usefulness of this remainder current is assessed in a tree-level calculation
of the $\gamma N \to K K \Xi$ reaction.
