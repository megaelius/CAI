The Machine Learning (ML) techniques are rapidly finding their place as standard methods of the
data analysis in High Energy Physics. In this paper we continue discussion on their application
to measurement of the CP state of the Higgs boson discovered by Large Hadron Collider experiments
at CERN laboratory in 2012. We consider measurement in the $H \to \tau \tau$ decay channel and use
ML techniques to discriminate between models based on variables defined in the multi-dimensional
phase-space. We discuss and quantify possible improvements for the two most sensitive decay modes:
$\tau^\pm \to \rho^\pm \nu$ with $\rho^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0$ and $\tau^\pm \to a_1^\pm \nu$ with
$a_1^\pm \to \rho^0 \pi^\pm \to 3 \pi^\pm$. In previous publications information on the hadronic
decay products of the $\tau$ leptons was used. Discriminating between Higgs boson CP state was studied
as binary classification problem. Now we show how approximate constraints on the outgoing neutrinos
momenta, not accessible in a direct way, can help to improve classification performance. Added
to the ML clasification features significantly enhance the sensitivity for Higgs boson CP state.
In principle all information is provided with 4-momenta of the final state particles present in
the events. As we have observed in the past, not all of such information is straightforward to be identified
in ML training. We investigate how optimised high-level features, like some angles of neutrino
orientation, may improve ML results. This can be understood as an intermediate step toward choice
of better classifiers where expert variables will not be necessary. For the performance comparison,
in parallel to {\it Deep Learning Neural Network}, we use other ML methods: {\it Boosted Trees},
{\it Random Forest} and {\it Support Vector Machine}.
