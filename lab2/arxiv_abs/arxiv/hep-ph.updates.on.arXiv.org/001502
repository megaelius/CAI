There are two kinds of new physics effects on non-resonant di-Higgs process from gluon fusion, non-SM
Higgs trilinear self-coupling $\lambda_{hhh}$ or new colored particles running in the loop. With
the aim of disentangling different new physics contributions, we study their characteristics
in the kinematic distributions. Assuming that the total cross section is observed to be about three
times as large as the SM expectation, we consider the cases of $\lambda_{hhh}/\lambda_{hhh}^{\rm
SM} =-0.5, 5.5$ as well as a new physics model with heavy vectorlike quarks in a type-II two Higgs double
model, called the VLQ-2HDM. A reasonable benchmark point is suggested in the exact wrong-sign limit,
where the opposite sign between the up-type VLQ and down-type VLQ couplings to the Higgs boson causes
the cancellation of their contributions to the single-Higgs production from gluon fusion. Because
of the threshold effects from the heavy VLQs in the loop, the VLQ-2HDM accommodates the bumps in the
distributions of the invariant mass of the Higgs boson pair ($M_{hh}$) and the transverse momentum
of a Higgs boson ($p_T^h$). The positions of two bumps are closely related as $ M_{hh} \simeq 2 M_{\rm
VLQ}$ and $p_T^h \simeq M_{\rm VLQ}$. In addition, the bumps located at the heavy VLQ mass naturally
lift up the $M_{hh}$ and $p_T^h$ distributions into high-mass and high-$p_T^h$ regions. On the
other hand, the non-SM Higgs trilinear coupling cases have the distributions shift into low $ M_{hh}$
and $p_T^h$ regions. Therefore, the kinematic region with high $M_{hh}$ and high $p_T^h$ shall
be a smoking-gun signal for the VLQ-2HDM. Full HL-LHC simulations for the di-Higgs signals are also
performed, confirming that the $b \bar{b} b \bar{b}$ final state can distinguish the VLQ-2HDM.
