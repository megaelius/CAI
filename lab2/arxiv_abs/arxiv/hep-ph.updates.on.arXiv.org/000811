The $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies observed in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau\nu$ decays have attracted a lot
of attentions in recent years. In this paper, we study the $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau\nu$, $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c\tau\nu$,
$B_c\to (J/\psi,\,\eta_c)\tau\nu$, $B\to X_c\tau\nu$, as well as $B_c\to\tau\nu$ decays, all
being mediated by the same quark-level $b\to c\tau\nu$ transition, in the Standard Model Effective
Field Theory. The most relevant dimension-six operators for these processes are $Q_{lq}^{(3)}$,
$Q_{ledq}$, $Q^{(1)}_{lequ}$, and $Q^{(3)}_{lequ}$ in the Warsaw basis. The evolution of the
corresponding Wilson coefficients from the new physics scale $\Lambda=1$~TeV down to the typical
energy scale $\mu_b\simeq m_b$ is carried out at three-loop in QCD and one-loop in EW/QED. It is found
that, after taking into account the constraint ${\cal B}(B_c\to\tau\nu)\lesssim 10\%$, a single
$\left[C_{lq}^{(3)}\right]_{3323}(\Lambda)$ or $\left[C^{(3)}_{lequ}\right]_{3332}(\Lambda)$
can still be used to resolve the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies at $1\sigma$, while a single $\left[C^{(1)}_{lequ}\right]_{3332}(\Lambda)$
is already ruled out by the measured $R(D^{(\ast)})$ at more than $3\sigma$. By minimizing the $\chi^2(C_i)$
function constructed based on the current experimental data on $R(D)$, $R(D^\ast)$, $P_\tau(D^\ast)$,
$R(J/\psi)$ and $R(X_c)$, we obtain eleven most trustworthy scenarios, each of which can provide
a good explanation of the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies at $1\sigma$. In order to further discriminate
these different scenarios, we predict thirty-one observables associated with the processes considered
under each NP scenario. It is found that most of the scenarios can be differentiated from each other
by using these observables as well as their correlations.
