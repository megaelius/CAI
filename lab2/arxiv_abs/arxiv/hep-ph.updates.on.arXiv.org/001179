In this thesis, I describe a number of recent important developments in neutrino cosmology on three
fronts. Firstly, focusing on Large-Scale Structure (LSS) data, I will show that current cosmological
probes contain a wealth of information on the sum of the neutrino masses. I report on the analysis
leading to the currently best upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of $0.12\,{\rm eV}$. I
show how cosmological data exhibits a weak preference for the normal neutrino mass ordering because
of parameter space volume effects, and propose a simple method to quantify this preference. Secondly,
I will discuss how galaxy bias represents a severe limitation towards fully capitalizing on the
neutrino information hidden in LSS data. I propose a method for calibrating the scale-dependent
galaxy bias using CMB lensing-galaxy cross-correlations. Moreover, in the presence of massive
neutrinos, the usual definition of bias becomes inadequate, as it leads to a scale-dependence on
large scales which has never been accounted for. I show that failure to define the bias appropriately
will be a problem for future LSS surveys, and propose a simple recipe to account for the effect of massive
neutrinos on galaxy bias. Finally, I discuss implications of correlations between neutrino parameters
and other cosmological parameters. In non-phantom dynamical dark energy models, the upper limit
on the sum of the neutrino masses becomes tighter than the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Therefore, such models
exhibit an even stronger preference for the normal ordering, and their viability could be jeopardized
should near-future laboratory experiments determine that the mass ordering is inverted. I then
discuss correlations between neutrino and inflationary parameters. I find that our determination
of inflationary parameters is stable against assumptions about the neutrino sector. (abridged)
