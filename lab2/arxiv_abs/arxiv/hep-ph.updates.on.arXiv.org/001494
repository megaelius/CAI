Intensity mapping (IM) of spectral lines has the potential to revolutionize cosmology by increasing
the total number of observed modes by several orders of magnitude compared to the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropies. In this paper, we consider IM of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the redshift
range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$ employing a halo model approach where HI is assumed to follow the distribution
of dark matter (DM) halos. If a portion of the DM is composed of ultralight axions then the abundance
of halos is changed compared to cold dark matter below the axion Jeans mass. With fixed total HI density,
$\Omega_{\rm HI}$, assumed to reside entirely in halos, this effect introduces a scale-independent
increase in the HI power spectrum on scales above the axion Jeans scale, which our model predicts
consistent with N-body simulations. Lighter axions introduce a scale-dependent feature even
on linear scales due to its suppression of the matter power spectrum near the Jeans scale. We use the
Fisher matrix formalism to forecast the ability of future HI surveys to constrain the axion fraction
of DM and marginalize over astrophysical and model uncertainties. We find that a HIRAX-like survey
is a very reliable IM survey configuration, being affected minimally by uncertainties due to non-linear
scales, while the SKA1MID configuration is the most constraining as it is sensitive to non-linear
scales. Including non-linear scales and combining a SKA1MID-like IM survey with the Simons Observatory
CMB, the benchmark ''fuzzy DM'' model with $m_a = 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ can be constrained at the 10%
level. For lighter ULAs this limit improves below 1%, and allows the possibility to test the connection
between axion models and the grand unification scale across a wide range of masses.
