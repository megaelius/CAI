The tau-lepton plays an important role in the physics program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
It offers a probe in searches for New Physics and to measure parameters of the Standard Model. Spin
of tau lepton is an interesting phenomenological quantity for separation of signal from background
or in measuring properties of particles. A proper treatment of tau spin effects in the Monte Carlo
simulations is important for understanding the detector acceptance as well as for the measurements/use
of tau polarization and tau spin correlations. The TauSpinner is a tool to modify tau$spin effects
in any sample. Also production matrix elements can be modified with its help. The general principle
of TauSpinner algorithm rely on the kinematic of outgoing particles (or jets) only, and to average
over all possible initial states accordingly to assumed parton distributions and cross-sections.
Incoming on mass-shell parton four-momenta are reconstructed in approximation, but energy-momentum
conservation is obeyed. Samples of events featuring tau leptons with their decay products, can
be used as an input. The information on the polarization and spin correlations, and production/decay
matrix elements is reconstructed from the kinematics of the tau lepton(s) (also nu_tau in case of
W-mediated processes) and tau decay products (also jets). No other information is required. By
calculating spin (or production/decay matrix element) weights, attributed to each event, it enables
evaluation of modifications without regenerating events. Elements of program functionalities
together with explanation of the use are given in Appendices. Present publication collect program
documentation, previously scattered over several publiications.
