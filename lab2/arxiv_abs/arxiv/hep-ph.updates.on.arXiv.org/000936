Hadron tomography can be investigated by three-dimensional structure functions such as generalized
parton distributions (GPDs), transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions, and generalized
distribution amplitudes (GDAs). Here, we extract the GDAs, which are $s$-$t$ crossed quantities
of the GPDs, from cross-section measurements of hadron-pair production process $\gamma^* \gamma
\rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0$ at KEKB. This work is the first attempt to obtain the GDAs from the actual
experimental data. The GDAs are expressed by a number of parameters and they are determined from
the data of $\gamma^* \gamma \rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0$ by including intermediate scalar- and tensor-meson
contributions to the cross section. Our results indicate that the dependence of parton-momentum
fraction $z$ in the GDAs is close to the asymptotic one. The timelike gravitational form factors
$\Theta_1$ and $\Theta_2$ are obtained from our GDAs, and they are converted to the spacelike ones
by the dispersion relation.From the spacelike $\Theta_1$ and $\Theta_2$, gravitational densities
of the pion are calculated. Then, we obtained the mass (energy) radius and the mechanical (pressure
and shear force) radius from $\Theta_2$ and $\Theta_1$, respectively. They are calculated as $\sqrt
{\langle r^2 \rangle _{\text{mass}}} =0.32 \sim 0.39$ fm, whereas the mechanical radius is larger
$\sqrt {\langle r^2 \rangle _{\text{mech}}} =0.82 \sim 0.88$ fm. This is the first report on the
gravitational radius of a hadron from actual experimental measurements. It is interesting to find
the possibility that the gravitational mass and mechanical radii could be different from the experimental
charge radius $\sqrt {\langle r^2 \rangle _{\text{charge}}} =0.672 \pm 0.008$ fm for the charged
pion.
