In this paper, we present results based on a combination of four inclusive topology searches for
supersymmetry (SUSY) from the CMS experiment, and use this to determine universal mass limits on
gluino and third-generation squarks in the context of Natural-like SUSY spectra. The class of Natural-like
SUSY spectra considered follows the typical Natural SUSY model made up of a gluino, third-generation
squarks, and higgsino sparticles, but is extended to more complex spectra containing sleptons.
We show that the limits obtained from the combination of inclusive topology searches are far more
stable than those from individual searches, with respect to the assumed underlying complexity
of the spectra. Hence, these limits can be considered as universal mass limits on gluino and third-generation
squarks, defined in the context of this broad class of Natural-like SUSY spectra. Furthermore,
we present our results using a simple colour scheme that allows a straightforward interpretation
of any Natural-like SUSY spectrum with our limits. Complementing the final results of the 2011 searches
based on 5 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, with the first published results from
the 2012 searches using approximately 11 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$, we find that gluinos with a mass of
$m_{\tilde{g}}\approx$ 1050 GeV and third-generation top and bottom squarks with masses of $m_{\tilde{3G}}\approx$
575 GeV are excluded for low masses of the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). We also establish a prediction
of how these limits might evolve when the full 2012 data set is analysed, with both the CMS and ATLAS
experiments combined. The importance of combining relevant inclusive topology searches, in order
to make the most universal interpretations possible, is a general recommendation for future experimental
searches at the LHC.
