CPT symmetry, the combination of Charge Conjugation, Parity and Time reversal, is a cornerstone
of our model building strategy and therefore the repercussions of its potential violation will
severely threaten the most extended tool we currently use to describe physics, i.e. local relativistic
quantum fields. However, limits on its conservation from the Kaon system look indeed imposing.
In this work we will show that neutrino oscillation experiments can improve this limit by several
orders of magnitude and therefore are an ideal tool to explore the foundations of our approach to
Nature. Strictly speaking testing CPT violation would require an explicit model for how CPT is broken
and its effects on physics. Instead, what is presented in this paper is a test of one of the predictions
of CPT conservation, i.e., the same mass and mixing parameters in neutrinos and antineutrinos.
In order to do that we calculate the current CPT bound on all the neutrino mixing parameters and study
the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to such an observable. After deriving the most updated bound
on CPT from neutrino oscillation data, we show that, if the recent T2K results turn out to be the true
values of neutrino and antineutrino oscillations, DUNE would measure the fallout of CPT conservation
at more than 3$\sigma$. Then, we study the sensitivity of the experiment to measure CPT invariance
in general, finding that DUNE will be able to improve the current bounds on $\Delta(\Delta m^2_{31})$
by at least one order of magnitude. We also study the sensitivity to the other oscillation parameters.
Finally we show that, if CPT is violated in nature, combining neutrino with antineutrino data in
oscillation analysis will produce imposter solutions.
