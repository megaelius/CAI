Within the standard V - A theory of weak interactions, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the linear
sigma-model (LsM) of strong low-energy hadronic interactions we analyse gauge properties of hadronic
structure of the neutron and proton in the neutron radiative beta-decay. We show that the Feynman
diagrams, describing contributions of hadronic structure to the amplitude of the neutron radiative
beta-decay in the tree-approximation for strong low-energy interactions in the LsM, are gauge
invariant. In turn, the complete set of Feynman diagrams, describing the contributions of hadron-photon
interactions in the one-hadron-loop approximation, is not gauge invariant. In the infinite limit
of the scalar sigma-meson, reproducing the current algebra results (Weinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett.
18, 188 (1967)), and to leading order in the large nucleon mass expansion the Feynman diagrams, violating
gauge invariance, do not contribute to the amplitude of the neutron radiative beta-decay in agreement
with Sirlin's analysis of strong low-energy interactions in neutron beta decays. We assert that
the problem of appearance of gauge non-invariant Feynman diagrams of hadronic structure of the
neutron and proton is related to the following. The vertex of the effective V-A weak interactions
does not belong to the combined quantum field theory including the LsM and QED. We argue that gauge
invariant set of Feynman diagrams of hadrons, coupled to real and virtual photons in neutron beta
decays, can be obtained within the combined quantum field theory including the Standard Electroweak
Model (SEM) and the LsM, where the effective V-A vertex of weak interactions is a result of the W^-
- electroweak boson exchange.
