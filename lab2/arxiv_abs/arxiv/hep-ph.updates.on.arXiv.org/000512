It has long been known that photons and gravitons may appear as vector and tensor Goldstone modes
caused \ by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). Usually this approach is considered
for photons and gravitons separately. We develop the emergent electrogravity theory consisting
of the ordinary QED and the tensor field gravity model which mimics the linearized general relativity
in Minkowski spacetime. In this theory, Lorentz symmetry appears incorporated into higher global
symmetries of the length-fixing constraints put on the vector and tensor fields involved, $A_{\mu
}^{2}=\pm M_{A}^{2}$ and $H_{\mu \nu }^{2}=\pm M_{H}^{2}$ ($M_{A}$ and $M_{H}$ are the proposed
symmetry breaking scales). We show that such a SLIV pattern being related to breaking of global symmetries
underlying these constraints induces the massless Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone modes shared
among photon and graviton. While for a vector field case the symmetry of the constraint coincides
with Lorentz symmetry $SO(1,3)$ of the electrogravity Lagrangian, the tensor field constraint
itself possesses much higher global symmetry $SO(7,3)$, whose spontaneous violation provides
a sufficient number of zero modes collected in a graviton. Accordingly, while photon may only contain
true Goldstone modes, graviton appears at least partially composed from pseudo-Goldstone modes
rather than from pure Goldstone ones. When expressed in terms of these modes, the theory looks essentially
nonlinear and contains a variety of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings. However, all SLIV effects
turn out to be strictly cancelled in the lowest order processes that is considered in some detail.
How this emergent electrogravity theory could be observationally differed from conventional
QED and GR theories is also briefly discussed.
