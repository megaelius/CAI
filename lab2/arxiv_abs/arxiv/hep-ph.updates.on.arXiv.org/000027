After the recent discovery of a Higgs-like boson particle at the CERN LHC-collider, it becomes more
necessary than ever to prepare ourselves for identifying its standard or non-standard nature.
The Electroweak parameter Delta r relating the values of the gauge boson masses [MW,MZ] and the Fermi
constant [G_F] is the traditional observable encoding high precision information of the electroweak
physics at the quantum level. In this work we present a complete quantitative study of Delta r in the
framework of the general (unconstrained) Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). First of all we report
on a systematic analysis of Delta r at the full one loop level in the general 2HDM, which to our knowledge
was missing in the literature. Thereby we extract a theoretical prediction for the mass of the W-boson
in this model, taking MZ, \alpha_{em} and G_F as experimental inputs. We find typical corrections
leading to mass shifts $\delta MW \sim 20-40 MeV$ which help to improve the agreement with the experimentally
measured value, in a degree no less significant than in the MSSM case. In the second part of our study
we extend our calculation beyond the mere one-loop order. We devise an effective Lagrangian approach
that captures the dominant higher order quantum effects on delta rho (viz. that part of Delta r describing
the breaking of the approximate SU(2) custodial symmetry) in the limit of large Higgs boson self-interactions.
This limit constitutes a telltale property of the general 2HDM which is unmatched by e.g. the MSSM.
Our conclusion is that the Electroweak precision program to be conducted at the LHC, and maybe at
a future linear collider, can nicely complement the direct searches. Should these distinctive
loop effects be eventually found they would signal a smoking gun hinting at non-standard Higgs physics.
