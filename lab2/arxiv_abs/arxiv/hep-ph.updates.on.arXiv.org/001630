Exclusive photoproduction of $\rho^0(770)$ mesons is studied using the H1 detector at the $ep$
collider HERA. A sample of about 900000 events is used to measure single- and double-differential
cross sections for the reaction $\gamma p \to \pi^{+}\pi^{-}Y$. Reactions where the proton stays
intact (${m_Y{=}m_p}$) are statistically separated from those where the proton dissociates to
a low-mass hadronic system ($m_p{<}m_Y{<}10$ GeV). The double-differential cross sections are
measured as a function of the invariant mass $m_{\pi\pi}$ of the decay pions and the squared $4$-momentum
transfer $t$ at the proton vertex. The measurements are presented in various bins of the photon-proton
collision energy $W_{\gamma p}$. The phase space restrictions are $0.5 < m_{\pi\pi} < 2.2$ GeV,
${\vert t\vert < 1.5}$ GeV${}^2$, and ${20 < W_{\gamma p} < 80}$ GeV. Cross section measurements
are presented for both elastic and proton-dissociative scattering. The observed cross section
dependencies are described by analytic functions. Parametrising the \mpipi dependence with a
\Soding model of photon dissociation into $\pi^{+}pi^{-}$ together with resonance production
leads to a measurement of the $\rho^{0}(770)$ meson mass and width at $m_\rho = 770.8\ {}^{+2.6}_{-2.7}$
(tot) MeV and $\Gamma_\rho = 151.3\ {}^{+2.7}_{-3.6}$ (tot) MeV, respectively. The model is used
to extract the $\rho^0(770)$ contribution to the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ cross sections and measure
it as a function of $t$ and $W_{\gamma p}$. In a Regge asymptotic limit in which one Regge trajectory
$\alpha(t)$ dominates, the intercept $\alpha(t{=}0) = 1.0654\ {}^{+0.0098}_{-0.0067}$ (tot)
and the slope $\alpha^\prime(t{=}0) = 0.233\ {}^{+0.067 }_{-0.074 }$ (tot) GeV${}^{-2}$ of the
$t$ dependence are extracted for the case $m_Y{=}m_p$.
