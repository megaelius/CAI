The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed highly energetic neutrinos in excess of the expected
atmospheric neutrino background. It is intriguing to consider the possibility that such events
are probing physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. In this context, $\mathcal{O}$(PeV)
dark matter (DM) particles decaying to neutrinos have been considered while DM annihilation has
been dismissed invoking the unitarity bound as a limiting factor for the annihilation rate. However,
the latter claim was done ignoring the contribution from DM substructure, which in a PeV Cold DM scenario,
would extend down to a free streaming mass of $\mathcal{O}$($10^{-18}$M$_\odot$). Since the unitarity
bound is less stringent at low velocities, ($\sigma_{\rm ann}$v)$\leq4\pi/m_\chi^2v$, then,
it is possible that these cold subhalos would contribute dominantly to a DM-induced neutrino flux
and easily account for the events observed by IceCube. A DM model where annihilations are enhanced
by a Sommerfeld mechanism can naturally support such scenario. Interestingly, the spatial distribution
of the events shows features that are expected in a DM interpretation. Although not conclusive,
7 of the 28 events appear to be clustered around the Galactic Center region while 5 others spatially
coincide, within the reported angular errors, with 4 of 26 Milky Way satellites. However, a simple
estimate of the probability of the latter occurring by chance is $\sim30%$. More events are needed
to statistically test this hypothesis. PeV DM particles are massive enough that their abundance
as thermal relics would overclose the Universe. This issue can be solved in alternative scenarios,
for instance if the decay of new massive unstable particles generates significant entropy reheating
the Universe to a slightly lower temperature than the freeze-out temperature, $T_{\rm RH} \lesssim
T_{\rm f}\sim4\times10^4$GeV.
