In terms of the structure of exotic hadrons and heavy hadronic states, diquarks have been considered
as important effective degrees of freedom. The diquark is composed of two quarks with gluonic interaction,
and it still strongly interacts with gluons because of its non-zero color charge. We investigate
the gluonic dressing effect for a scalar diquark using the Schwinger-Dyson formalism in the Landau
gauge. The scalar diquark is treated as an extended fundamental field like a meson in effective hadron
models. The Schwinger-Dyson equation for the scalar diquark diagrammatically has an additional
4-point interaction term, in comparison with the single quark case. Here, we introduce an effective
size of the diquark inside a hadron, since it is a bound-state-like object of two quarks. The effective
size and the bare mass of the diquark are free parameters in this scalar theory. The diquark effective
size $R$ can be taken to be smaller than a hadron, $R\sim 1$ fm, and larger than a constituent quark,
$R\sim 0.3$ fm. The bare mass is considered as twice of constituent quark mass or twice of running
quark mass, which is determined by the Schwinger-Dyson equation for single quark. We find that the
compact diquark with $R\simeq 0.3$ fm has a large effective mass about 1 GeV in both cases of bare mass,
and therefore such a compact diquark is not acceptable in effective models for hadrons. We also consider
the artificial removal of 3- and 4-point interaction, respectively, to see the role of each term,
and find that the 4-point interaction plays the dominant role of the diquark self-energy. Finally,
we discuss the non-chiral origin mass generation mechanism of scalar diquark by non-perturbative
gluonic dressing effect.
