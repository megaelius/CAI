A valid prediction from quantum field theory for a physical observable should be independent of
the choice of renormalization scheme -- this is the primary requirement of renormalization group
invariance (RGI). Satisfying scheme invariance is a challenging problem for perturbative QCD
(pQCD), since truncated perturbation series do not automatically satisfy the requirements of
the renormalization group. Two distinct approaches for satisfying the RGI principle have been
suggested in the literature. One is the "Principle of Maximum Conformality" (PMC) in which the terms
associated with the $\beta$-function are absorbed into the scale of the running coupling at each
perturbative order; its predictions are scheme and scale independent at every finite order. The
other approach is the "Principle of Minimum Sensitivity" (PMS), which is based on local RGI; the
PMS approach determines the optimal renormalization scale by requiring the slope of the approximant
of an observable to vanish. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the PMC and PMS procedures
by analyzing two physical observables $R_{e+e-}$ and $\Gamma(H\to b\bar{b})$ up to four-loop
order in pQCD. At the four-loop level, the PMC and PMS predictions for both observables agree within
small errors with those of conventional scale setting, and each prediction shows small scale dependences.
However, the convergence of the pQCD series at high orders, behaves quite differently: The PMC displays
the best pQCD convergence since it eliminates the divergent renormalon terms; in contrast, the
convergence of the PMS prediction is questionable, often even worse than the conventional prediction
based on an arbitrary guess for the renormalization scale. ......
