In this paper, we consider a lopsided flavor texture compatible with thermal leptogenesis in partially
composite Pati--Salam unification. The Davidson--Ibarra bound for the successful thermal leptogenesis
can be recast to the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN) charge of the lopsided texture. We found the FN charge
$n_{\nu1}$ of the lightest right-handed neutrino $\nu_{R1}$ can not be larger than a upper bound,
$n_{\nu1} \lesssim 4.5$. To realize these FN charges, we utilize the partial compositeness. In
this picture, the hierarchies of the Yukawa matrices is a consequence of mixing between massless
chiral fermions $f$ and heavy vector fermions $F$. That is induced by the linear mixing terms $\lambda^{f}
\bar f_{L} F_{R}$ and $\lambda^{f'} \bar F'_{L} f'_{R}$. If the GUT breaking Higgs contributes
these linear mixing terms, the resulting Yukawa interactions can be different between quarks and
leptons. For this purpose, we use the bi-fundamental Higgs $H_{R}$ (4,1,2) under the PS group $G_{PS}
= SU(4)_{c} \times SU(2)_{L} \times SU(2)_{R}$. A particular set of non-renormalizable couplings
between this GUT Higgs and fermions generates GUT breaking linear mixing. As a result, the large
$\tan \beta$ case $n_{\nu i} = (1,0,0)$ in which leptons receive mass term seems to be natural. Moreover,
it is found that heavy (composite) neutrino sector should have (almost) same flavor structure to
reproduce the large mixing of neutrinos by the seesaw formula. If the VEV of GUT breaking Higgs mediates
some flavor structure, they contribute to some mass term. Then, this statement can be hold for even
in other Pati--Salam model, that does not assume the partial compositeness.
