We construct a generalized EFT approach to dense compact-star matter that exploits the CCP for hadron-quark
continuity at high density, hidden topology and hidden symmetries of QCD. No Landau-Ginzburg-Wilsonian-type
phase transition is involved. The microscopic DoF of QCD possibly intervening at high baryonic
density are traded in for fractionalized topological objects. Essential in the description are
symmetries invisible in QCD in the matter-free vacuum: Scale symmetry, flavor local symmetry and
parity-doubling. The partial emergence of scale symmetry is signaled by a dilatonic scalar in a
"pseudo-conformal" structure. Flavor gauge symmetry manifests with the $\rho$ meson mass going
toward a Wilsonian RGFP identified with the VMFP at which the gauge boson mass goes to zero. Parity
doubling is to take place as the quasi-nucleon mass converges to the chiral invariant $m_0$. The
theory accounts satisfactorily for all known properties of normal nuclear matter and makes certain
predictions that are drastically different from what's available in the literature. In particular,
it provides a topological mechanism, argued to be robust, for the cross-over from soft-to-hard
EoS that predicts the star properties in overall agreement with the presently available data, including
the maximum star mass $M_{max}\sim 2.3 M_\odot$ and the recent LIGO/Virgo GW data. What is most glaringly
different from all other approaches known, however, is the prediction for the rapid convergence
to a sound velocity of star $v_s^2\approx 1/3$ at a density $n\gsim 3 n_0$, far from the asymptotic
density $\gsim 50n_0$ expected in pQCD. We interpret this to signal the onset of albeit approximate
conformal symmetry in dense compact-star matter. The model developed here could bring out a new
paradigm in nuclear/hadron physics, exploiting ideas in condensed matter physics, nuclear and
particle physics and astrophysics.
