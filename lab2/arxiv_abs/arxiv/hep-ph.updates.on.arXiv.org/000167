Astrophysical charge-free black holes are known to satisfy no-hair relations through which all
multipole moments can be specified in terms of just their mass and spin angular momentum. We here
investigate the possible existence of no-hair-like relations among multipole moments for neutron
stars and quark stars that are independent of their equation of state. We calculate the multipole
moments of these stars up to hexadecapole order by constructing uniformly-rotating and unmagnetized
stellar solutions to the Einstein equations. For slowly-rotating stars, we construct stellar
solutions to quartic order in spin in a slow-rotation expansion, while for rapidly-rotating stars,
we solve the Einstein equations numerically with the LORENE and RNS codes. We find that the multipole
moments extracted from these numerical solutions are consistent with each other. We confirm that
the current-dipole is related to the mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of state independent
fashion, which does not break for rapidly rotating neutron stars or quark stars. We further find
that the current-octupole and the mass-hexadecapole moments are related to the mass-quadrupole
in an approximately equation of state independent way to $\sim 10%$, worsening in the hexadecapole
case. All of our findings are in good agreement with previous work that considered stellar solutions
to leading-order in a weak-field expansion. The quartic in spin, slowly-rotating solutions found
here allow us to estimate the systematic errors in the measurement of the neutron star's mass and
radius with future X-ray observations, such as NICER and LOFT. We find that the effect of these quartic-in-spin
terms on the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments and stellar eccentricity may dominate the error
budget for very rapidly-rotating neutron stars. The new universal relations found here should
help to reduce such systematic errors.
