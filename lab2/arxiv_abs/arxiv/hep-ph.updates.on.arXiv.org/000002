In this thesis we investigated, at partonic level and leading order, the LHC potencial operating
with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and integrated luminosity of $L=100\;{fb}^{-1}$ to probe "pure" (without
triple vertex contributions) anomalous electroweak quartic couplings, $WWWW$ and $WWZZ$, in
the semileptonic $pp \rightarrow l^{\pm}\nu_{l}jjjj$ channel, enhanced by the Vector Boson Fusion
collider signatures. Deviations on SM quartic couplings were parameterized in a model independent
approach, realized linearly ($L_{S0}$ and $L_{S1}$ operators) or not ($L_{4}$ and $L_{5}$ operators),
on the basis of effective lagrangians. Being our analysis essentially events counting-and-cut
based, we took into account all possible backgrounds (irreducible, QCD and top quarks processes)
considered at ${\cal O}(\alpha_{em}^{6})$, ${\cal O(\alpha_{em}^{4}\alpha_{s}^{2})$ and
${\cal O}(\alpha_{em}^{2}\alpha_{s}^{4})$. In this way, we have obtained the following constraints
for the non-linear $\alpha_{4}$ and $\alpha_{5}$ anomalous couplings: $|\alpha_{4,5}| \lesssim
0.01$ to 0.02 at 3$\sigma$. Based on non-linear results, we have estimated, for a specific choice
of factorization and renormalization scale, the linear parameters $f_{0}$ and $f_{1}$ constraints
as $-22 \leq \dfrac{f_{0}}{\Lambda^{4}}\;({TeV}^{-4}) \leq 20, \quad {and} \quad -26 \leq \dfrac{f_{1}}{\Lambda^{4}}\;({TeV}^{-4})
\leq 24$ at 3$\sigma$. On a different approach, manipulating one extension of the SM named $331_{RHN}$,
we have evaluated the contribution of new sources of FCNC for the difference of mass of neutral meson
systems, $K_{0}-\bar{K_{0}}$, $D^{0}-\bar{D^0}$ and $B^0_d-\bar{B^0_d}$. Bounds related
to these systems may be significantly strengthened in the presence of these new interactions allowing
stronger constraints on the parameter space of the model.
