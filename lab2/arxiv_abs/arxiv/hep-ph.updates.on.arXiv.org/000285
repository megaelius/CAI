We develop a higher-order perturbation theory for large-scale structure formation involving
a free-streaming hot or warm dark matter species. We focus on the case of mixed cold dark matter and
massive neutrinos, although our approach is applicable also to a single warm dark matter species.
In order to capture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small scales, we
account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space distribution using the Vlaslov equation,
and derive from it a formal closed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic
perturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to the neutrino density
contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed neutrino momentum distribution. We calculate
the leading-order total matter bispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark,
we test the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in perturbative
and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that combines the exact linear evolution with
the nonlinear structure of the fluid equations. Aiming at $\lesssim1\%$ accuracy, we find that
the total matter bispectrum with a low neutrino mass m=0.046 eV can be reproduced by all but the fluid
approximation, while for larger neutrino masses m=0.46-0.93 eV only the hybrid approach has the
desired accuracy on a large range of scales. This result serves as a cautionary note that approximate
nonlinear models of neutrino clustering that reproduce the gross features of some observables
may not suffice for precision calculations, nor are they guaranteed to apply to other observables.
All of the approximation schemes fail to reproduce the bispectrum of the neutrino density perturbations
at better than 20% accuracy across all scales, indicating that an exact treatment of nonlinear neutrino
perturbations is necessary.
