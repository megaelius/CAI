The discovery of quasar J1342+0928 (z=7.54) reinforces the time compression problem associated
with the premature formation of structure in LCDM. Adopting the Planck parameters, we see this quasar
barely 690 Myr after the big bang, no more than several hundred Myr after the transition from Pop III
to Pop II star formation. Yet conventional astrophysics would tell us that a 10 solar-mass seed,
created by a Pop II/III supernova, should have taken at least 820 Myr to grow via Eddington-limited
accretion. This failure by LCDM constitutes one of its most serious challenges, requiring exotic
`fixes', such as anomalously high accretion rates, or the creation of enormously massive (~10^5
solar-mass) seeds, neither of which is ever seen in the local Universe, or anywhere else for that
matter. Indeed, to emphasize this point, J1342+0928 is seen to be accreting at about the Eddington
rate, negating any attempt at explaining its unusually high mass due to such exotic means. In this
paper, we aim to demonstrate that the discovery of this quasar instead strongly confirms the cosmological
timeline predicted by the R_h=ct universe. We assume conventional Eddington-limited accretion
and the time versus redshift relation in this model to calculate when a seed needed to start growing
as a function of its mass in order to reach the observed mass of J1342+0928 at z=7.54. Contrary to the
tension created in the standard model by the appearance of this massive quasar so early in its history,
we find that in the R_h=ct cosmology, a 10 solar-mass seed at z~15 (the start of the Epoch of Reionization
at t~878 Myr) would have easily grown into an 8 x 10^8 solar-mass black hole at z=7.54 (t~1.65 Gyr)
via conventional Eddington-limited accretion.
