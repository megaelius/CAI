New Physics contributions to Delta F=2 transitions in models with constrained Minimal Flavour
Violation (CMFV), are parametrized by a single variable S(v), the value of the real box diagram function.
With already precise experimental values of epsilon_K, Delta M_d, Delta M_s, CP-asymmetry S_{psi
K_S} and of hat{B}_K entering the evaluation of epsilon_K, the future of CMFV in the Delta F=2 sector
depends crucially on the values of |Vcb|, |Vub|, gamma, F_{B_s} sqrt{hat B_{B_s}} and F_{B_d} sqrt{hat
B_{B_d}}. The ratio xi of the latter two parameters, rather precisely determined from lattice calculations,
allows then together with Delta M_s/Delta M_d and S_{psi K_S} to determine the range of gamma in the
unitarity triangle independently of the value of S(v). Imposing in addition the constraints from
epsilon_K and Delta M_d allows to determine the favorite CMFV values of |Vcb|, |Vub|, F_{B_s} sqrt{hat
B_{B_s}} and F_{B_d} sqrt{hat B_{B_d}} as functions of S(v) and gamma. The |Vcb|^4 dependence of
epsilon_K allows to determine |Vcb| for a given S(v) and gamma with a higher precision than it is presently
possible using tree-level decays. The same applies to |Vub|, |Vtd| and |Vts| that are automatically
determined as functions of S(v) and gamma. Typically F_{B_s}sqrt{hat B_{B_s}} and F_{B_d} sqrt{hat
B_{B_d}} have to be significantly lower than their present lattice values, while |Vcb| has to be
significantly higher than its tree-level determination. The region in the space of these three
parameters allowed by CMFV indicates visible problems in this class of models and hints for the presence
of new sources of flavour violation and/or new local operators in Delta F=2 data that are strongly
suppressed in these models. As a byproduct we propose to reduce the present uncertainty in the charm
contribution toepsilon_K by using the experimental value of Delta M_K.
