In this work we investigate the implication of $K\to \pi \nu \bar{\nu}$ from the recent KOTO and NA62
measurements for generic neutrino interactions and the new physics scale in effective field theories.
The interactions between quarks and left-handed Standard Model (SM) neutrinos are first described
by the low energy effective field theory (LEFT) below the electroweak scale. We match them to the
chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) at the chiral symmetry breaking scale to calculate the branching
fractions of Kaon semi-invisible decays and match them up to the SM effective field theory (SMEFT)
to constrain new physics above the electroweak scale. In the framework of effective field theories,
we prove that the Grossman-Nir bound is valid for both dim-6 and dim-7 LEFT operators, and the dim-6
vector and scalar operators dominantly contribute to Kaon semi-invisible decays based on LEFT
and chiral power counting rules. They are induced by multiple dim-6 lepton-number-conserving
operators and one dim-7 lepton-number-violating operator in the SMEFT, respectively. In the lepton-number-conserving
$s\to d$ transition, the $K\to \pi \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays provide the most sensitive probe for the
operators with $\tau\tau$ component and point to a corresponding new physics scale of $\Lambda_{\rm
NP} \in[47~\text{TeV},~72~\text{TeV}]$ associated with a single effective coefficient. The
lepton-number-violating operator can also explain the observed $K\to\pi\nu\bar{\nu}$ discrepancy
with the SM prediction within a narrow range $\Lambda_{\rm NP}\in [19.4~\text{TeV},~21.5~\text{TeV}]$,
which is consistent with constraints from Kaon invisible decays.
