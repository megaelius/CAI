Along the years, the Cornell Model has been extraordinarily successful in describing hadronic
phenomenology, in particular in physical situations for which an effective theory of the strong
interactions such as NRQCD cannot be applied. As a consequence of its achievements, a relevant question
is whether its model parameters can somehow be related to fundamental constants of QCD. We shall
give a first answer in this article by comparing the predictions of both approaches. Building on
results from a previous study on heavy meson spectroscopy, we calibrate the Cornell model employing
NRQCD predictions for the lowest-lying bottomonium states up to N$^3$LO, in which the bottom mass
is varied within a wide range. We find that the Cornell model mass parameter can be identified, within
perturbative uncertainties, with the MSR mass at the scale $R = 1\,$GeV. This identification holds
for any value of $\alpha_s$ or the bottom mass, and for all perturbative orders investigated. Furthermore,
we show that: a) the "string tension" parameter is independent of the bottom mass, and b) the Coulomb
strength $\kappa$ of the Cornell model can be related to the QCD strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$
at a characteristic non-relativistic scale. We also show how to remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon of
the static QCD potential and sum-up large logs related to the renormalon subtraction by switching
to the low-scale, short-distance MSR mass, and using R-evolution. Our R-improved expression for
the static potential remains independent of the heavy quark mass value and agrees with lattice QCD
results for values of the radius as large as $0.8\,$fm, and with the Cornell model potential at long
distances. Finally we show that for moderate values of $r$, the R-improved NRQCD and Cornell static
potentials are in head-on agreement.
