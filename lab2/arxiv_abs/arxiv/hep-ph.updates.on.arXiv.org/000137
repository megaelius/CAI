Type-II seesaw is a simple scenario in which Majorana neutrino masses are generated by the exchange
of a heavy scalar electroweak triplet. When endowed with additional heavy fields, such as right-handed
neutrinos or extra triplets, it also provides a compelling framework for baryogenesis via leptogenesis.
We derive in this context the full network of Boltzmann equations for studying leptogenesis in the
flavored regime. To this end we determine the relations which hold among the chemical potentials
of the various particle species in the thermal bath. This takes into account the SM Yukawa interactions
of both leptons and quarks as well as sphaleron processes which, depending on the temperature, may
be classified as faster or slower than the Hubble rate. We find that when leptogenesis is enabled
by the presence of an extra triplet, lepton flavor effects allow the production of the $B-L$ asymmetry
through lepton number conserving CP asymmetries. This scenario becomes dominant as soon as the
triplets couple more to leptons than to SM scalar doublets. In this case, the way the $B-L$ asymmetry
is created through flavor effects is novel: instead of invoking the effect of $L$-violating inverse
decays faster than the Hubble rate, it involves the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays slower
than the Hubble rate. We also analyze the more general situation where lepton number violating CP
asymmetries are present and actively participate in the generation of the $B-L$ asymmetry, pointing
out that as long as $L$-violating triplet decays are still in thermal equilibrium when the triplet
gauge scattering processes decouple, flavor effects can be striking, allowing to avoid all washout
suppression effects from seesaw interactions. In this case the amount of $B-L$ asymmetry produced
is limited only by a universal gauge suppression effect, which nevertheless goes away for large
triplet decay rates.
