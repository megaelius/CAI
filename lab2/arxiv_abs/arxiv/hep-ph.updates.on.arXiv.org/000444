The linear-sigma model, in which information about confining gluons is included through the Polyakov-loop
potential (PLSM), is considered in order to perform a systematic study for various magnetic properties
of QCD matter under extreme conditions of high temperatures and densities and finite magnetic field
strengths. The introduction of magnetic field to the PLSM Lagrangian requires suitable utilization
of Landau quantization, modification in the dispersion relations, and momentum-space dimension-reduction.
We observed that increasing the magnetic field leads to filling-up lower Landau levels first and
decreasing the number of occupied levels. We conclude that the population of Landau levels is most
sensitive to the magnetic field and to the quark charges. The influences of finite magnetic field
on the temperature dependence of chiral and deconfinement order-parameter(s) are studied. We
present estimations for the magnetization, the magnetic susceptibility, the permeability and
the catalysis properties of QCD matter as functions of temperature. The dependences of the resulting
freezeout parameters, temperatures and baryon chemical potentials on the corresponding magnetic
field strengths have been analyzed, as well. These calculations are compared with recent lattice
QCD simulations, whenever available. We conclude that the QCD matter seems to have paramagnetic
property at temperatures greater than the critical one. There is an evidence for weak diamagnetic
property at low temperatures. Last but not least, we observe that the magnetic catalysis is inverse,
namely the critical temperatures decrease with increasing the magnetic field.
