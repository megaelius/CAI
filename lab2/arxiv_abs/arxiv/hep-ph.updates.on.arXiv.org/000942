We analyse the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$)-spectra as a function of charged-particle multiplicity
at midrapidity ($|y| < 0.5$) for various identified particles such as $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$,
$K_S^0$, $p+\overline{p}$, $\phi$, $K^{*0} + \overline {K^{*0}}$, and $\Lambda$ + $\bar{\Lambda}$
in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV using Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast Wave (BGBW) model
and thermodynamically consistent Tsallis distribution function. We obtain the multiplicity
dependent kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{\rm kin}$) and radial flow ($\beta$) of various
particles after fitting the $p_{\rm T}$-distribution with BGBW model. Here, $T_{\rm kin}$ exhibits
mild dependence on multiplicity class while $\beta$ shows almost independent behaviour. The information
regarding Tsallis temperature and the non-extensivity parameter ($q$) are drawn by fitting the
$p_{\rm T}$-spectra with Tsallis distribution function. The extracted parameters of these particles
are studied as a function of charged particle multiplicity density ($dN_{ch}/d\eta$). In addition
to this, we also study these parameters as a function of particle mass to observe any possible mass
ordering. All the identified hadrons show a mass ordering in temperature, non-extensive parameter
and also a strong dependence on multiplicity classes, except the lighter particles. It is observed
that as the particle multiplicity increases, the $q$-parameter approaches to Boltzmann-Gibbs
value, hence a conclusion can be drawn that system tends to thermal equilibrium. The observations
are consistent with a differential freeze-out scenario of the produced particles.
