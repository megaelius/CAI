Exascale computing could soon enable a predictive theory of nuclear structure and reactions rooted
in the standard model of particle physics, with quantifiable and systematically improvable uncertainties.
Such a predictive theory will help us more fully exploit experiments that use nucleons and nuclei
as laboratories for testing the standard model and its limitations. Examples include direct dark
matter detection, neutrinoless double beta decay, and searches for permanent electric dipole
moments of the neutron and atoms. It will also help us connect quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to the
properties of cold neutron stars and hot supernova cores, environments governed by the strong interaction.
We argue here that a quantitative bridge between QCD and the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter
will require a synthesis of lattice QCD (especially as applied to two- and three-nucleon interactions),
effective field theory, and ab initio methods for solving the nuclear many-body problem. While
there are significant challenges that must be addressed in developing this triad of theoretical
tools, the rapid advance of computing is accelerating progress. In particular, we focus this review
on the anticipated advances from lattice QCD and how these advances will impact few-body effective
theories of nuclear physics. We review the status of lattice QCD applications to low-energy nuclear
physics and current challenges the field is facing. We describe progress in developing few-body
effective (field) theories of nuclear physics, including the expected use of lattice QCD to provide
first-principles determinations of their low-energy constants. We use the examples of neutrinoless
double beta decay and the nuclear-matter equation of state to illustrate how the coupling of lattice
QCD to effective theory might impact our understanding of symmetries and exotic astrophysical
environments.
