Cosmological observations usually map our present-day past light cone. However, it is also possible
to compare different past light cones. This is the concept behind the redshift drift, a model-independent
probe of fundamental cosmology. In simple physical terms, this effectively allows us to watch the
Universe expand in real time. While current facilities only allow sensitivities several orders
of magnitude worse than the expected signal, it should be possible to detect it with forthcoming
ones. Here we discuss the potential impact of measurements by three such facilities: the Extremely
Large Telescope (the subject of most existing redshift drift forecasts), but also the Square Kilometre
Array and intensity mapping experiments. For each of these we assume the measurement sensitivities
estimated respectively in Liske {\it et al.} (2008), Klockner {\it et al.} (2015) and Yu {\it et al.}
(2014). We focus on the role of these measurements in constraining dark energy scenarios, highlighting
the fact that although on their own they yield comparatively weak constraints, they do probe regions
of parameter space that are typically different from those probed by other experiments, as well
as being redshift-dependent. Specifically, we quantify how combinations of several redshift
drift measurements at different redshifts, or combinations of redshift drift measurements with
those from other canonical cosmological probes, can constrain some representative dark energy
models. Our conclusion is that a model-independent mapping of the expansion of the universe from
redshift $z=0$ to $z=4$---a challenging but feasible goal for the next generation of astrophysical
facilities---can have a significant impact on fundamental cosmology.
