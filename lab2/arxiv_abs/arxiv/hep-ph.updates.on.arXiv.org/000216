The local uplift via local SYZ mirror symmetry of (M)N (fractional)D3-branes, and wrapped N_f flavor
D7-branes in the presence of a black-hole resulting in a non-Kaehler resolved warped deformed conifold
(NKRWDC) in [1], was carried out in [2] and resulted in black M3-branes; the deviation from the ISD
condition of G_3 proportional to the square of the resolution parameter, in the limits of [1] and
MQGP limit of [2], imposed on (g_s,M,N), can be ignored [3]. The uplift, if valid globally, asymptotes
to M5-branes wrapping a two-cycle (homologously an (large) integer sum of two-spheres) in AdS_5xM_6.
Interestingly, in the limits of [1]/ [2], assuming the deformation > resolution, by estimating
the five SU(3) structure torsion (\tau) classes W_{1,2,3,4,5} we show that \tau\in W_5 in the large-r
limit, implying the NKRWDC reduces to a warped Kaehler deformed conifold. Further, the local T^3
of [2] in the large-r limit and the limits of [1] and the `MQGP' limit of [2], satisfies the same conditions
as the maximal T^2-invariant special Lagrangian three-cycle of T^*(S^3) of [4], partly justifying
use of local SYZ mirror symmetry in [2]. Using the Ouyang embedding in the DBI action of a D7-brane
or by dimensionally reducing the 11-dimensional EH action to five (R^{1,3},r) dimensions, we then
calculate a variety of gauge and metric-perturbation-modes' two-point functions using the prescription
of [5], and show: (i) diffusion constant D~1/T, (ii) the electrical conductivity \sigma~T, (iii)
the charge susceptibility \chi~ T^2, (iv) [using (i) - (iii)] the Einstein's relation \sigma/\chi=D,
is indeed satisfied, (v) the R-charge diffusion constant D_R~1/T, and (vi) the possibility of generating
\eta/s=1/4pi from solutions to the vector and tensor mode metric perturbations ' EOMs, separately.
All results are also valid for g_s~<1 as part of MQGP limit.
