For dark matter (DM) particles with masses in the 0.6 - 6 m_p range, we set stringent constraints on
the interaction cross-sections for scattering with ordinary baryonic matter. These constraints
follow from the recognition that such particles can be captured by - and thermalized within - the
Earth, leading to a substantial accumulation and concentration of DM that interact with baryons.
Here, we discuss the probability that DM intercepted by the Earth will be captured, the number of
DM particles thereby accumulated over Earth's lifetime, the fraction of such particles retained
in the face of evaporation, and the density distribution of such particles within the Earth. In the
latter context, we note that a previous treatment of the density distribution of DM, presented by
Gould and Raffelt and applied subsequently to DM in the Sun, is inconsistent with considerations
of hydrostatic equilibrium. Our analysis provides an estimate of the DM particle density at Earth's
surface, which may exceed 1.E+14 cm-3 for the mass range under consideration. Based upon our determination
of the DM density at Earth's surface, we derive constraints on the scattering cross-sections. These
constraints are placed by four considerations: (1) the lifetime of the relativistic proton beam
at the Large Hadron collider (LHC); (2) the orbital decay of spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO);
(3) the vaporization rate of cryogenic liquids in well-insulated storage dewars; and (4) the thermal
conductivity of Earth's crust. As an example application of our results, we show that for the scattering
cross-sections that were invoked recently in Barkana's original explanation for the anomalously
deep 21 cm absorption reported by EDGES, DM particle masses in the 0.6 - 4 m_p range are ruled out.
