Effective neutrino-quark generalized interactions are entirely determined by Lorentz invariance,
so they include all possible four-fermion non derivative Lorentz structures. They contain neutrino-quark
non-standard interactions as a subset, but span over a larger set that involves effective scalar,
pseudoscalar, axial and tensor operators. Using recent COHERENT data, we derive constraints on
the corresponding couplings by considering scalar, vector and tensor quark currents and assuming
no lepton flavor dependence. We allow for mixed neutrino-quark Lorentz couplings and consider
two types of scenarios in which: (i) one interaction at the nuclear level is present at a time, (ii)
two interactions are simultaneously present. For scenarios (i) our findings show that scalar interactions
are the most severely constrained, in particular for pseudoscalar-scalar neutrino-quark couplings.
In contrast, tensor and non-standard vector interactions still enable for sizable effective parameters.
We find as well that an extra vector interaction improves the data fit when compared with the result
derived assuming only the standard model contribution. In scenarios (ii) the presence of two interactions
relaxes the bounds and opens regions in parameter space that are otherwise closed, with the effect
being more pronounced in the scalar-vector and scalar-tensor cases. We point out that barring the
vector case, our results represent the most stringent bounds on effective neutrino-quark generalized
interactions for mediator masses of order $\sim 1\,$GeV. They hold as well for larger mediator masses,
case in which they should be compared with limits from neutrino deep-inelastic scattering data.
