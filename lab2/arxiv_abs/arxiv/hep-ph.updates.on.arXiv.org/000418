The QCD equation of state at zero baryon chemical potential is the only element of the standard dynamical
framework to describe heavy ion collisions that can be directly determined from first principles.
Continuum extrapolated lattice QCD equations of state have been computed using 2+1 quark flavors
(up/down and strange) as well as 2+1+1 flavors to investigate the effect of thermalized charm quarks
on QCD thermodynamics. Lattice results have also indicated the presence of new strange resonances
that not only contribute to the equation of state of QCD matter but also affect hadronic afterburners
used to model the later stages of heavy ion collisions. We investigate how these new developments
obtained from first principles calculations affect multiparticle correlations in heavy ion collisions.
We compare the commonly used equation of state S95n-v1, which was constructed using what are now
considered outdated lattice results and hadron states, to the current state-of-the-art lattice
QCD equations of state with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors coupled to the most up-to-date hadronic resonances
and their decays. New hadronic resonances lead to an enhancement in the hadronic spectra at intermediate
$p_T$. Using an outdated equation of state can directly affect the extraction of the shear viscosity
to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, of the quark-gluon plasma and results for different flow observables.
The effects of the QCD equation of state on multiparticle correlations of identified particles
are determined for both AuAu $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and PbPb $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV collisions.
New insights into the $v_2\{2\}$ to $v_3\{2\}$ puzzle in ultracentral collisions are found. Flow
observables of heavier particles exhibit more non-linear behavior regardless of the assumptions
about the equation of state, which may provide a new way to constrain the temperature dependence
of $\eta/s$.
