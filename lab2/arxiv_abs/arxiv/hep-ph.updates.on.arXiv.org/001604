After an introduction to the QCD phase diagram, the nuclear equations of state, and neutron star
mergers, I discuss three projects related to transport and nuclear matter in neutron star mergers.
The first is the nature of beta equilibrium in the portion of a merger that is transparent to neutrinos.
We calculate the weak interaction (Urca) rates and find that the beta equilibrium condition needs
to be modified by adding an additional chemical potential, which changes slightly the particle
content in neutrino-transparent beta equilibrium. Secondly, we calculate the bulk viscosity
in neutrino-transparent nuclear matter in conditions encountered in neutron star mergers. Bulk
viscosity arises from a phase lag between the pressure and density in the nuclear matter, which is
due to the finite rate of beta equilibration. When bulk viscosity is sufficiently strong, which
happens when the equilibration rate nearly matches the frequency of the density oscillation, it
can noticeably dampen the oscillation. We find that in certain thermodynamic conditions likely
encountered in mergers, oscillations in nuclear matter can be damped on timescales on the order
of 10 milliseconds, so we conclude that bulk viscosity should be included in merger simulations.
Finally, we study thermal transport due to axions in neutron star mergers. We conclude that axions
are never trapped in mergers, but instead escape, carrying energy away from the merger. We calculate
the cooling time due to the energy carried away by axions and find that within current constraints
on the axion-nucleon coupling, axions could cool fluid elements in mergers on timescales which
could affect the dynamics of the merger.
