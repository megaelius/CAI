The latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data severely constrain the conventional warm dark matter solution
to small-scale issues in the cold dark matter paradigm. It has been also reported that unconstrained
astrophysical processes may address the issues. In response to this situation, we revisit the decaying
dark matter solution to the issues, discussing possible signatures to discriminate decaying dark
matter from astrophysical processes as a solution to small-scale issues. We consider an axinolike
particle (ALPino) decaying into an axionlike particle (ALP) and gravitino with the lifetime around
the age of the Universe. The ALPino mass is sub-PeV and slightly ($\Delta m/m\sim 10^{-4}$) larger
than the gravitino mass, and thus the dark matter abundance does not alter virtually after the ALPino
decays. On the other hand, the gravitino produced from the ALPino decay obtains a kick velocity of
$\sim 30 \,{\rm km / s}$, which is sufficiently larger than a circular velocity of dwarf galaxies
to impact their dark matter distributions. The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest constraints are relieved
since only a small fraction ($\sim10$%) of dark matter experiences the decay at that time. Decaying
dark matter is thus promoted to a viable solution to small-scale issues. The ALPino relic abundance
is determined predominantly by the decay of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle. The
monochromatic ALP emission from the ALPino decay is converted to $\sim 50 \,{\rm GeV}$ photon under
the Galactic magnetic field. The morphology of the gamma-ray flux shows a distinctive feature of
the model when compared to decaying dark matter that directly decays into photons. Once detected,
such distinctive signals discriminate the decaying dark matter solution to small-scale issues
from unconstrained astrophysical processes.
