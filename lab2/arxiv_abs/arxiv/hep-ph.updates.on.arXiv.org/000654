The photon transverse momentum spectrum and its anisotropy from Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider energy $\sqrt {s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV are investigated within the integrated hydrokinetic
model (iHKM). Photon production is accumulated from the different processes at the various stages
of relativistic heavy ion collisions: from the primary hard photons of very early stage of parton
collisions to the thermal photons from equilibrated quark-gluon and hadron gas stages. Along the
way a hadronic medium evolution is treated in two distinct, in a sense opposite, approaches: chemically
equilibrated and chemically frozen system expansion. Studying the centrality dependence of the
results obtained allows us to conclude that a relatively strong transverse momentum anisotropy
of thermal radiation is suppressed by prompt photon emission which is an isotropic. We find out that
this effect is getting stronger as centrality increases because of the simultaneous increase in
the relative contribution of prompt photons in the soft part of the spectra. The substantial results
obtained in iHKM with nonzero viscosity ($\eta/s=0.08$) for photon spectra and $v_2$ coefficients
are mostly within the error bars of experimental data, but there is some systematic underestimation
of both observables for the near central events. We claim that a situation could be significantly
improved if an additional photon radiation that accompanies the presence of a deconfined environment
is included. Since a matter of a space-time layer where hadronization takes place is actively involved
in anisotropic transverse flow, both positive contributions to the spectra and $v_2$ are considerable,
albeit such an argument needs further research and elaboration.
