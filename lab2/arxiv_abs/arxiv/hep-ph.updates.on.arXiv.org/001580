One of the great challenges of QCD is to determine the partonic structure of the nucleon from first
principles. In this work, we provide such a determination of the unpolarized parton distribution
function (PDF), utilizing the non-perturbative formulation of QCD on the lattice. We apply Radyushkin's
pseudo-distribution approach to lattice results obtained using simulations with the light quark
mass fixed to its physical value; this is the first ever attempt for this approach directly at the
physical point. The extracted coordinate-space matrix elements are used to find the relevant physical
Ioffe time distributions from a matching procedure. The full Bjorken-$x$ dependence of PDFs is
resolved using several reconstruction methods to tackle the ill-conditioned inverse problem
encountered when using discrete lattice data. Another novelty of this calculation is the consideration
of the combination with antiquarks $q_v+2\bar{q}$. The latter, together with the non-singlet
valence quark PDF $q_v$, provides information on the full distribution. Good agreement is found
with PDFs from global fits already within statistical uncertainties and it is further improved
by quantifying several systematic effects. The results presented here are the first ever \emph{ab
initio} determinations of PDFs fully consistent with global fits in the whole $x$-range. Thus,
they pave the way to investigating a wider class of partonic distributions, such as e.g.\ singlet
PDFs and generalized parton distributions. Therefore, essential and yet missing first-principle
insights can be achieved, complementing the rich experimental programs dedicated to the structure
of the nucleon.
