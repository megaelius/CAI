We examine the perturbative calculation of the inclusive semi-leptonic decay rate $\Gamma$ for
the $b$-quark, using mass-independent renormalization. To finite order of perturbation theory
the series for $\Gamma$ will depend on the unphysical renormalization scale parameter $\mu$ and
on the particular choice of mass-independent renormalization scheme; these dependencies will
only be removed after summing the series to all orders. In this paper we show that all explicit $\mu$-dependence
of $\Gamma$, through powers of ln$(\mu)$, can be summed by using the renormalization group equation.
We then find that this explicit $\mu$-dependence can be combined together with the implicit $\mu$-dependence
of $\Gamma$ (through powers of both the running coupling $a(\mu)$ and the running $b$-quark mass
$m(\mu)$) to yield a $\mu$-independent perturbative expansion for $\Gamma$ in terms of $a(\mu)$
and $m(\mu)$ both evaluated at a renormalization scheme independent mass scale $I\!\!M$ which
is fixed in terms of either the ``$\overline{MS}$ mass'' $\overline{m}_b$ of the $b$ quark or its
pole mass $m_{pole}$. At finite order the resulting perturbative expansion retains a degree of
arbitrariness associated with the particular choice of mass-independent renormalization scheme.
We use the coefficients $c_i$ and $g_i$ of the perturbative expansions of the renormalization group
functions $\beta(a)$ and $\gamma(a)$, associated with $a(\mu)$ and $m(\mu)$ respectively, to
characterize the remaining renormalization scheme arbitrariness of $\Gamma$. We further show
that all terms in the expansion of $\Gamma$ can be written in terms of the $c_i$ and $g_i$ coefficients
and a set of renormalization scheme independent parameters $\tau_i$.
