A recent numerical lattice calculation of the kaon mixing matrix elements of general $\Delta S=2$
four-fermion operators using staggered fermions relied on two auxiliary theoretical calculations.
Here we describe the methodology and present the results of these two calculations. The first concerns
one-loop matching coefficients between staggered lattice operators and the corresponding continuum
operators. Previous calculations with staggered fermions have used a non-standard regularization
scheme for the continuum operators, and here we provide the additional matching factors needed
to connect to the standard regularization scheme. This is the scheme in which two-loop anomalous
dimensions are known. We also observe that all previous calculations of this operator matching
using staggered fermions have overlooked one matching step in the continuum. This extra step turns
out to have no impact on three of the five operators (including that relevant for $B_K$), but does
affect the other two operators. The second auxiliary calculation concerns the two-loop renormalization
group (RG) evolution equations for the $B$-parameters of the $\Delta S=2$ operators. For one pair
of operators, the standard analytic solution to the two-loop RG equations fails due to a spurious
singularity introduced by the approximations made in the calculation. We give a non-singular expression
derived using analytic continuation, and check the result using a numerical solution to the RG equations.
We also describe the RG evolution for "golden" combinations of $B$-parameters, and give numerical
results for RG evolution matrices needed in the companion lattice calculation.
