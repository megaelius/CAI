In the semi-constrained NMSSM (scNMSSM, or NMSSM with non-universal Higgs mass) under current
constraints, we consider a scenario where $h_2$ is the SM-like Higgs, $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ is singlino-dominated
LSP, $\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1$ and $\tilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}$ are mass-degenerated, light and higgsino-dominated
NLSPs (next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles). We investigate the constraints to these
NLSPs from searching for SUSY particles at the LHC Run-I and Run-II, discuss the possibility of discovering
these NLSPs in the future, and come to the following conclusions regarding the higgsino-dominated
$100\sim200{\rm GeV}$ NLSPs in scNMSSM: (i) Among the search results for electrowekinos, the multilepton
final state constrain our scenario most, and can exclude some of our samples. While up to now, the
search results by Atlas and CMS with Run I and Run II data at the LHC can still not exclude the higgsino-dominated
NLSPs of $100\sim200{\rm GeV}$. (ii) When the mass difference with $\tilde{\chi}^0_{1}$ is smaller
than $m_{h_2}$, $\tilde{\chi}^0_{2}$ and $\tilde{\chi}^0_{3}$ have opposite preference on
decaying to $Z/Z^*$ or $h_1$. (iii) The best channels to detect the NLSPs are though the real two-body
decay $\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1} \to \tilde{\chi}^0_1 W^{\pm}$ and $\tilde{\chi}^0_{2,3} \to
\tilde{\chi}^0_1 Z/h_2$. When the mass difference is sufficient, most of the samples can be checked
at $5\sigma$ level with future $300{~\rm fb}^{-1}$ data at the LHC. While with $3000 {~\rm fb}^{-1}$
data at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), nearly all of the samples can be checked at $5\sigma$ level
even if the mass difference is insufficient. (iv) The $a_1$ funnel and the $h_2/Z$ funnel are the
two main mechanisms for the singlino-dominated LSP annihilation, which can not be distinguished
by searching for NLSPs.
