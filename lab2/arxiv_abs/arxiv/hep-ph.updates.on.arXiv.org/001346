In recent years, experiments revealed intriguing hints for new physics (NP) in semi-leptonic $B$
decays. Both in charged current processes, involving $b \to c \tau \nu$ transitions, and in the neutral
currents $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$, a preference for NP compared to the standard model (SM) of more that
$3\sigma$ and $5\sigma$ was found, respectively. In addition, there is the long-standing tension
between the theory prediction and the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of the
muon ($a_\mu$) of more than $3\sigma$. Since all these observables are related to the violation
of lepton flavor universality (LFU), a common NP explanation seems not only plausible but is even
desirable. In this context, leptoquarks (LQs) are especially promising since they give tree-level
effects in semi-leptonic $B$ decays, but only loop-suppressed effects in other flavor observables
that agree well with their SM predictions. Furthermore, LQs can lead to a $m_t/m_\mu$ enhanced effect
in $a_{\mu}$, allowing for an explanation even with (multi) TeV particles. However, a single scalar
LQ representation cannot provide a common solution to all three anomalies. In this article we therefore
consider a model in which we combine two scalar LQs: the $SU(2)_L$ singlet and the $SU(2)_L$ triplet.
Within this model we compute all relevant one-loop effects and perform a comprehensive phenomenological
analysis, pointing out various interesting correlations among the observables. Furthermore,
we identify benchmark points which are in fact able to explain all three anomalies ($b \to c \tau \nu$,
$b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ and $a_\mu$), without violating bounds from other observables, and study
their predictions for future measurements.
