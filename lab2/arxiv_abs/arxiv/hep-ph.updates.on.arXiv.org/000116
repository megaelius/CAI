The Standard Model of particle physics has been strengthened by the recent discovery of the long-awaited
Higgs boson. The standard cosmological model has met the challenge of the high precision observations
in cosmology and astroparticle physics. However these two standard models face both several theoretical
issues, such as the naturalness problem in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model, as well as observational
issues, in particular the fact that an unknown kind of matter called Dark Matter accounts for the
majority of the matter content in our Universe. Attempts to solve such problems have led to the development
of New Physics models during the last decades. Supersymmetry is one such model which addresses the
fine-tuning problem in the Higgs sector and provides viable Dark Matter candidates. Current high
energy and high precision experiments give many new opportunities to probe the supersymmetric
models. It is in this context that this thesis is written. Considering the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM), the simplest supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model of particle
physics, and its conventional Dark Matter candidate, the neutralino, it is shown that collider
constraints could provide informations on the very early Universe at the inflation area. It is also
demonstrated that the Indirect Detection of Dark Matter, despite several drawbacks, can be a powerful
technique to probe supersymmetric Dark Matter models. Beyond the MSSM it is shown that unique characteristics
of the Dark Matter candidate in the NMSSM could be probed at colliders. The study of a supersymmetric
model with an extended gauge symmetry, the UMSSM, is also developed. The features of another Dark
Matter candidate of this model, the Right-Handed sneutrino, are analysed. More general constraints
such as those coming from low energy observables are finally considered in this model.
