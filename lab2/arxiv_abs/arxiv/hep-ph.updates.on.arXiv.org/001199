We complete the derivation of the conservative dynamics of binary systems to fourth Post-Newtonian
(4PN) order in the effective field theory (EFT) approach. We present a self-contained (ambiguity-free)
computation of the renormalized Lagrangian, entirely within the confines of the PN expansion.
While we confirm the final results reported in the literature, we clarify several issues regarding
intermediate infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences, as well as the renormalization procedure.
First, we properly identify the IR and UV singularities using (only) dimensional regularization
and the method of regions, which are the pillars of the EFT formalism. This requires a careful study
of scaleless integrals in the potential region, as well as conservative contributions from radiation
modes due to tail effects. As expected by consistency, the UV divergences in the near region (due
to the point-particle limit) can be absorbed into two counter-terms in the worldline effective
theory. The counter-terms can then be removed by field redefinitions, such that the renormalization
scheme-dependence has no physical effect to 4PN order. The remaining IR poles, which are spurious
in nature, are unambiguously removed by implementing the zero-bin subtraction in the EFT approach.
The procedure transforms the IR singularities into UV counter-parts. As anticipated, the left-over
UV poles explicitly cancel out against UV divergences in conservative terms from radiation-reaction,
uniquely determining the gravitational potential. Similar artificial IR/UV poles, which are
intimately linked to the split into regions, are manifest at lower orders. Starting at 4PN, both
local- and nonlocal-in-time contributions from the radiation region enter in the conservative
dynamics. Neither additional regulators nor ambiguity-parameters are introduced at any stage
of the computations.
