The extension of Non-Relativistic-to-Covariant classification scheme seems to be an urgent problem
in the Hadron Spectroscopy. Here are given the recent results of our research. 1) Brief history of
our way of the extension on Kinematical Frameworks: from SU(2)_{sigma} $\otimes$ O(3)_{L} to U
(4)_{DS,m} (Tensor-space of Dirac Spinor with the static unitary symm. SU(2)_{m}, which is new
Mass-Reversal symm. reflecting the situation of Q.C.) $\otimes O(2)_{r\perp v}$ (2-dim. internal
spatial-vector r vertical to Boost-velocity v, embedded in the O(3,1)_{Lorentz}). Also is brought
in Cov. scheme the thus far Overlooked Chirality Symm. of QCD/Stand. Gauge Model. 2) Propertime
tau-Quantum Mechanics for Conf. Q. System and Quantization of Comp. Hadron field is developed.
The similar to conventional procedures are performed in Lorentz-Inv. Particle Frame (Galilean
Inertial Frame with v=const) which becomes Lorentz-Cov. Observer F., when v=0. The one notable
feature of the tau-Q.M. is concerned only future-development, inducing the Crossing Rule; the
other also inducing Existence of the Chiral-Quark (JP=(1/2)-) in addition to Pauli-Quark (JP=(1/2)+),
which is Origin of SU(2)_m-symm., leading to Existence of New-Exotics. 3) Evolved framework of
hadron spectroscopy guided by tau-Q.M. is summarized: Especially, "Regge Trajectories", in qqbar
meson system are given by $M^2$ vs. $\hat{N}(n,l)$; $M^2=M_{0}^2+N \Omega$ (N=2n+l), Intrinsic
spin of Comp. Hadrons J=S, where Orbital l contributes only to N. 4) New Classif. scheme is applied
to Phenomenology of Bottomonium System.As a result is shown Remarkable Fact, including a serious
Problem in the N.R. scheme, concerned on Spin-Flip Mechanism of Heavy Quarks, seems to disappear
in our scheme. This seems to suggest that the phenomenological knowledge,thus far obtained resorting
on N.R.scheme, should be reexamined from the covariant one.
