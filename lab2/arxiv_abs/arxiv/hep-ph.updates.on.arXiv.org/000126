We analyze the impact of data from the full Run 1 of the LHC at 7 and 8 TeV on the CMSSM with mu > 0 and
< 0 and the NUHM1 with mu > 0, incorporating the constraints imposed by other experiments such
as precision electroweak measurements, flavour measurements, the cosmological density of cold
dark matter and the direct search for the scattering of dark matter particles in the LUX experiment.
We use the following results from the LHC experiments: ATLAS searches for events with MET accompanied
by jets with the full 7 and 8 TeV data, the ATLAS and CMS measurements of the mass of the Higgs boson,
the CMS searches for heavy neutral Higgs bosons and a combination of the LHCb and CMS measurements
of B_s to mu+mu- and B_d to mu+mu-. Our results are based on samplings of the parameter spaces of the
CMSSM for both mu>0 and mu<0 and of the NUHM1 for mu > 0 with 6.8 x 10^6, 6.2 x 10^6 and 1.6 x 10^7
points, respectively, obtained using the MultiNest tool. The impact of the Higgs mass constraint
is assessed using FeynHiggs 2.10.0, which provides an improved prediction for the masses of the
MSSM Higgs bosons in the region of heavy squark masses. It yields in general larger values of M_h than
previous versions of FeynHiggs, reducing the pressure on the CMSSM and NUHM1. We find that the global
chi^2 functions for the supersymmetric models vary slowly over most of the parameter spaces allowed
by the Higgs mass and the MET searches, with best-fit values that are comparable to the chi^2/dof
for the best Standard Model fit. We provide 95% CL lower limits on the masses of various sparticles
and assess the prospects for observing them during Run 2 of the LHC.
