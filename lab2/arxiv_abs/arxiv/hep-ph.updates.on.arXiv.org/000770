The renormalization-scheme and scale dependence of the truncated QCD perturbative expansions
is one of the main sources of theoretical error of the standard model predictions, especially at
intermediate energies. Recently, a class of renormalization schemes, parametrized by a single
real number $C$, has been defined and investigated in the frame of the standard perturbation expansions
in powers of the coupling. In the present paper we investigate the $C$-scheme variation of a Borel-improved
QCD perturbation series, which implements information about the large-order divergent character
of perturbation theory by means of an optimal conformal mapping of the Borel plane. In the new expansions,
the powers of the strong coupling are replaced by a set of expansion functions with properties which
resemble those of the expanded correlators, having in particular a singular behavior at the origin
of the complex coupling plane. On the other hand, the new expansions have a tamed increase at high
orders, as demonstrated by previous studies in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme.
Using as examples the Adler function and the hadronic decay width of the $\tau$ lepton, we investigate
the properties of the Borel-improved expansions in the $C$-scheme, in comparison with the standard
expansions in the $C$-scheme and the expansions in $\overline{\text{MS}}$. The variation with
the renormalization scale and the prescription for the choice of an optimal value of the parameter
$C$ are discussed. The good large-order behavior of the Borel-improved expansions is proved also
in the $C$-scheme, which is a further argument in favor of using them in applications of perturbative
QCD at intermediate energies.
