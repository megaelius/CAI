The future 100-km circular collider FCC at CERN is planned to operate in one of its modes as an electron-positron
FCC-ee machine. We give an overview comparing the theoretical status to the experimental demands
of one of four foreseen FCC-ee operating stages, Z-boson resonance energy physics, called the FCC-ee
Tera-Z stage for short. The FCC-ee Tera-Z will deliver the highest integrated luminosities as well
as very small systematic errors for a study of the Standard Model (SM) with unprecedented precision.
In fact, the FCC-ee Tera-Z will allow the study of at least one more perturbative order in quantum
field theory compared to the LEP/SLC precision. The real problem is that the present precision of
theoretical calculations of the various SM observables does not match that of the anticipated experimental
measurements. The bottle-necks to overcoming this situation are identified. In particular, the
issues of precise QED unfolding and the correct calculation of SM pseudo-observables are critically
reviewed. In an Executive Summary, we specify which basic theoretical calculations are needed
to meet the strong experimental expectations at the FCC-ee Tera-Z. Several methods, techniques
and tools needed for higher-order multi-loop calculations are presented. By inspection of the
Z-boson partial and total decay width analyses, it is argued that at the beginning of operation of
the FCC-ee Tera-Z, the theory predictions may be tuned to be precise enough not to limit the physics
interpretation of the measurements. This statement is based on anticipated progress in analytical
and numerical calculations of multi-loop and multi-scale Feynman integrals and on the completion
of two-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the SM pseudo-observables this year. However,
the above statement is conditional as the theoretical issues demand a very dedicated and focused
investment by the community.
