Very-high-energy (VHE) BL Lac spectra extending above $10 \, \rm TeV$ provide a unique opportunity
for testing physics beyond the standard model of elementary particle and alternative blazar emission
models. We consider the hadron beam, the photon to axion-like particle (ALP) conversion, and the
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) scenarios by analyzing their consequences and induced modifications
to BL Lac spectra. In particular, we consider how different processes can provide similar spectral
features (e.g. hard tails) and we discuss the ways they can be disentangled. We use HEGRA data of a
high state of Markarian 501 and the HESS spectrum of the extreme BL Lac (EHBL) 1ES 0229+200. In addition,
we consider two hypothetical EHBLs similar to 1ES 0229+200 located at redshifts $z=0.3$ and $z=0.5$.
We observe that both the hadron beam and the photon-ALP oscillations predict a hard tail extending
to energies larger than those possible in the standard scenario. Photon-ALP interaction predicts
a peak in the spectra of distant BL Lacs at about $20-30 \, \rm TeV$, while LIV produces a strong peak
in all BL Lac spectra around $\sim 100 \, \rm TeV$. The peculiar feature of the photon-ALP conversion
model is the production of oscillations in the spectral energy distribution, so that its detection/absence
can be exploited to distinguish among the considered models. The above mentioned features coming
from the three models may be detected by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Thus, future
observations of BL Lac spectra could eventually shed light about new physics and alternative blazar
emission models, driving fundamental research towards a specific direction.
