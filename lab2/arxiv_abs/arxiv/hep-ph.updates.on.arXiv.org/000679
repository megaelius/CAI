In this note, we introduce the new tool reSolve, a Monte Carlo differential cross-section and parton-level
event generator whose main purpose is to add transverse momentum resummation to a general class
of inclusive processes at hadron colliders, namely all those which do not involve hadrons or jets
in the measured final state. This documentation refers to the first main version release, which
will form the basis for continued developments, consequently it only implements the key features
of those we plan to ultimately include. This article acts as a manual for the program; describing
in detail its use, structure, validation and results; whilst also highlighting key aspects of the
resummation formalism applied. It details the two classes of processes so far included; these are
diphoton production and Drell-Yan production. A main concept behind the development of the tool
is that it is a hands-on white box for the user: significant effort has been made to give the program
a modular structure, making the various parts which comprise it independent of each other as much
as possible and ensuring they are transparently documented, customizable and, in principle, replaceable
with something that may better serve the users needs. reSolve is a new C++ program, based on an evolution
of the private Fortran code 2gres, previously used for the calculations in refs. [1] and [2]; it is
also influenced by the DYRes Fortran code of refs. [3] and [4]. This initial version calculates the
low transverse momentum contribution to the fully differential cross-section for two main categories
of processes; the inclusive production of two photons, and inclusive Drell-Yan production. In
all cases resummation up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithm (NNLL) is included. We aim to extend
the program to several more processes in the near future. The program is publicly available on Github.
