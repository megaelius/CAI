In this work, we explicate a new approach for eliminating renormalization scale and scheme (RSS)
dependence in physical observables. We develop this approach by matching RSS dependent observables
to a theory which is independent of both these forms of dependencies. We term the fundamental basis
behind this approach as the Principle of Observable Effective Matching (POEM), which entails matching
of a scale and scheme dependent observable with the fully physical and dynamical scale (PS) dependent
theory at the tree and at higher loop orders at which RSS independence is guaranteed. This is aimed
towards achieving a so-called "effective" RSS independent expression, as the resulting dynamical
dependence is derived from a particular order in RSS dependent perturbation theory and is sensitive
to the matching scale. With this matching, we obtain an "Effective Physical Observable (EPO)",
a finite-order RSS independent version of the RSS dependent observable. We illustrate our approach
with a study of the QCD cross section $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ which is demonstrated to achieve scale and
scheme independence utilizing the 3- and 4-loop order $\overline{MS}$ scheme expression in perturbation
theory via matching at both one-loop and two-loop orders for obtaining the EPO. At the tree-loop
matching, we find physical cutoff $\Lambda_{eff}$ of the physical observable which is RSS independent.
With one-loop matching, we obtain an EPO prediction of $\frac{3}{11}R_{e^{+}e^{-}}^{eff}=1.052738_{-0.0006}^{+0.0006}$
and $\frac{3}{11}R_{e^{+}e^{-}}^{eff}=1.052739_{-0.0006}^{+0.0006}$ from 2-loop EPO matching
at $Q=31.6 GeV$, which are both in excellent agreement with the experimental value of $\frac{3}{11}R_{e^{+}e^{-}}^{exp}=1.0527_{-0.005}^{+0.005}$.
