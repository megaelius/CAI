We calculate the contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment hadronic vacuum polarization
from the connected diagrams of up and down quarks, omitting electromagnetism. We employ QCD gauge-field
configurations with dynamical $u$, $d$, $s$, and $c$ quarks and the physical pion mass, and analyze
five ensembles with lattice spacings ranging from a~0.06-0.15 fm. The up- and down-quark masses
in our simulations have equal masses $m_l$. We obtain, in this world where all pions have the mass
of the $\pi^0$, $10^{10} a_\mu^{ll}({\rm conn.}) = 630.1(8.3)$, in agreement with independent
lattice-QCD calculations. We then combine this value with published lattice-QCD results for the
connected contributions from strange, charm, and bottom quarks, and an estimate of the uncertainty
due to the fact that our calculation does not include strong-isospin breaking, electromagnetism,
or contributions from quark-disconnected diagrams. We obtain for the total order $(\alpha^2)$
hadronic-vacuum polarization to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment $10^{10} a_\mu^{\rm HVP,LO}
= 691(8)_{u,d}(1)_{s,c,b} (13)_{\rm other}$, where the errors are from the light-quark connected
contribution, heavy-flavor connected contributions, and omitted effects listed above, respectively.
Our result agrees with both $ab-initio$ lattice-QCD calculations and phenomenological determinations
from experimental $e^+e^-$-scattering data. It is 1.7$\sigma$ below the "no new physics" value
of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution inferred from combining the BNL E821 measurement
of $a_\mu$ with theoretical calculations of the other contributions.
