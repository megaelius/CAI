After the recent historical discovery of gravitational wave, it is curious to speculate upon the
detection prospect of the quantum graviton in the terrestrial accelerator-based experiment.
We carefully investigate the "golden" channels, $J/\psi(\Upsilon)\to\gamma+\text{graviton}$,
which can be pursued at \textsf{BESIII} and \textsf{Belle 2} experiments, by searching for single-photon
plus missing energy events. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework of General Relativity
(GR) together with Nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), we are capable of making solid predictions for
the corresponding decay rates. It is found that these extremely suppressed decays are completely
swamped by the Standard Model background events $J/\psi (\Upsilon)\to \gamma+\nu\bar{\nu}$.
Meanwhile, we also study these rare decay processes in the context of massive gravity, and find the
respective decay rates in the limit of vanishing graviton mass drastically differ from their counterparts
in GR. Counterintuitive as the failure of smoothly recovering GR results may look, our finding is
reminiscent of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity widely known in classical gravity,
which can be traced to the finite contribution of the helicity-zero graviton in the massless limit.
Nevertheless, at this stage we are not certain about the fate of the discontinuity encountered in
this work, whether it is merely a pathology or not. If it could be endowed with some physical significance,
the future observation of these rare decay channels, would, in principle, shed important light
on the nature of gravitation, whether the graviton is strictly massless, or bears a very small but
nonzero mass.
