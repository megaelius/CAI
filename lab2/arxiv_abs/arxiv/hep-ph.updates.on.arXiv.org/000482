We perform the combined analysis of the double Higgs production via gluon fusion in the $b\bar{b}
\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ decay channels at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
To validate our analysis, we reproduce the ATLAS result of the $b\bar{b} \gamma\gamma$ process
including all contributions from fakes. For the $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ decay channel, we perform
the similar analysis to the CMS one. As an improvement, we also perform the multivariate analysis
employing the Boosted Decision Tree algorithm. Then, we derive 68% probability contours on anomalous
Higgs couplings in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach for various analyses. We find that
the $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ process outperforms the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ for measurement
of energy-growing operators, while adding the $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ process is least beneficial
for improving the precision of the Higgs self coupling (mainly set by the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$
process). We illustrate that the double Higgs production alone can be comparable to the single Higgs
process in constraining the modification of the top Yukawa coupling in the positive direction.
Focusing on the Higgs self coupling as a special interest, we derive the precision as a function of
various improvable parameters such as tag and mis-tag rates of tau-leptons, heavy flavor jets,
photon identification and di-photon mass resolution to take into account future phenomenological
studies. As an optimistic benchmark scenario, we illustrate that 68% and 95% probability intervals
of the Higgs self coupling, $\lambda_3/\lambda_{3}^{SM}$, at the HL-LHC can reach $[0.04,\, 2.7]
\cup [5.5,\, 5.6]$ and $[-0.1,\, 6.4]$ respectively where the correlation among the EFT coefficients
is taken into account
