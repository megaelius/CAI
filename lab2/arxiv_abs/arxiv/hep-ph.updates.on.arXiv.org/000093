We make a comparative and comprehensive study on the charmonium exclusive productions at the $e^+e^-$
collider with the collision energy either around the $Z^0$-boson mass for a super $Z$ factory or
equals to 10.6 GeV for the $B$ factories as Belle and BABAR. We study the total cross sections for the
charmonium production via the exclusive processes $e^+e^- \to \gamma^*/Z^0 \to H_{1}+H_{2}$
and $e^+e^- \to \gamma^*/Z^0 \to H_{1} +\gamma$, where $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ represent the dominant
color-singlet $S$-wave and $P$-wave charmonium states respectively. Total cross sections versus
the $e^+e^-$ collision energy $\sqrt{s}$, together with their uncertainties, are presented,
which clearly show the relative importance of these channels. At the $B$ factory, the production
channels via the virtual $\gamma^*$ propagator are dominant over the channels via the $Z^0$ propagator
by about four orders. While, at the super $Z$ factory, due to the $Z^0$-boson resonance effect, the
$Z^0$ boson channels shall provide sizable or even dominant contributions in comparison to the
channels via the $\gamma^*$ propagator. Sizable exclusive charmonium events can be produced at
the super $Z$ factory with high luminocity up to $10^{36}{\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}$, especially
for the channel of $e^+e^- \to Z^0 \to H_{1} +\gamma$, e.g. by taking $m_c=1.50\pm0.20$ GeV, we shall
have $(5.0^{+0.8}_{-0.6})\times10^4$ $J/\psi$, $(7.5^{+1.1}_{-0.9})\times10^3$ $\eta_c$,
$(6.2^{+3.3}_{-1.9})\times10^3$ $h_{c}$, $(3.1^{+1.7}_{-0.9})\times10^2$ $\chi_{c0}$,
$(2.2^{+1.0}_{-0.4})\times10^3$ $\chi_{c1}$, and $(7.7^{+4.1}_{-2.4})\times10^2$ $\chi_{c2}$
events by one operation year. Thus, in addition to the $B$ factories as BABAR and Belle, such a super
$Z$ factory shall provide another useful platform for studying the heavy quarkonium properties
and for testing QCD theories.
