We consider a class of SUSY models in which the MSSM gauge group is supplemented with a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$
symmetry and a global $U(1)_{R}$ symmetry. This extension introduces only electrically neutral
states, and the new SUSY partners effectively double the number of states in the neutralino sector
that now includes a blino (from $B-L$) and singlino from a gauge singlet superfield. If the DM density
is saturated by a LSP neutralino, the model yields quite a rich phenomenology depending on the DM
composition. The LSP relic density constraint provides a lower bound on the stop and gluino masses
of about 3 TeV and 4 TeV respectively, which is testable in the near future collider experiments such
as HL-LHC. The chargino mass lies between 0.24 TeV and about 2.0 TeV, which can be tested based on the
allowed decay channels. We also find $m_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}\gtrsim 500$ GeV, and $m_{\tilde{e}},m_{\tilde{\mu}},m_{\tilde{\nu}^{S,P}}
\gtrsim 1$ TeV. We identify chargino-neutralino coannihilation processes in the mass region $0.24
\,{\rm TeV} \lesssim m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\approx m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}}\lesssim
1.5$ TeV, and also coannihilation processes involving stau, selectron, smuon and sneutrinos for
masses around 1 TeV. In addition, $A_{2}$ resonance solutions are found around 1 TeV, and $H_{2}$
and $H_{3}$ resonance solutions are also shown around 0.5 TeV and 1 TeV . Some of the $A_{2}$ resonance
solutions with $\tan\beta \gtrsim 20$ may be tested by the $A/H\rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$
LHC searches. While the relic density constraint excludes the bino-like DM, it is still possible
to realize higgsino, singlino and blino-like DM for various mass scales. We show that all these solutions
will be tested in future direct detection experiments such as LUX-Zeplin and Xenon-nT.
