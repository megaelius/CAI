Motivated by the flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetry for unifying flavor physics and string theory,
we investigate a supersymmetric extension of standard model (SM) for a lucid explanation of inflation
and leptogenesis by introducing $U(1)$ symmetries such that the $U(1)$-$[gravity]^2$ anomaly-free
condition together with the SM flavor structure demands additional sterile neutrinos as well as
no axionic domain-wall problem. Such additional neutrinos may play a crucial role as a bridge between
leptogenesis and new neutrino oscillations along with high energy cosmic events. In the model gravitational
interactions explicitly break supersymmetry (SUSY) down to SUSY$_{\rm inf}\times$SUSY$_{\rm
vis}$, where SUSY$_{\rm inf}$ corresponds to the supergravity symmetry with its goldstino (mainly
as inflatino) eaten by gravitino, while the orthogonal SUSY$_{\rm vis}$ is approximate global
symmetry with its corresponding uneaten goldstino giving masses to all the supersymmetric SM superpartners.
In a realistic moduli stabilization, we show that the moduli backreaction effect on the inflationary
potential leads to the energy scale of inflation with the inflaton mass in a way that the power spectrum
of the curvature perturbation and the scalar spectral index are to be well fitted with the latest
Planck observation. We suggest that a new leptogenesis scenario could naturally be implemented
via Affleck-Dine mechanism. So we show that the resultant baryon asymmetry, constrained by the
sum of active neutrino masses and new high energy neutrino oscillations, crucially depends on the
reheating temperature $T_{\rm reh}$. And we show that the model has a prediction $T_{\rm reh}\simeq(59-84)$
TeV, which is compatible with the required $T_{\rm reh}$ to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.
