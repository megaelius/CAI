We develop a supersymmetric bi-axion model of high-scale inflation coupled to supergravity, in
which the axionic structure originates from, and is protected by, gauge symmetry in an extra dimension.
While local supersymmetry (SUSY) is necessarily Higgsed at high scales during inflation we show
that it can naturally survive down to the $\sim$ TeV scale in the current era in order to resolve the
electroweak hierarchy problem. We show how a suitable inflationary effective potential for the
axions can be generated at tree-level by charged fields under the higher-dimensional gauge symmetry.
The inflationary trajectory lies along the lightest direction in the bi-axion field space, with
periodic effective potential and an effective super-Planckian field range emerging from fundamentally
sub-Planckian dynamics. The heavier direction in the field space is shown to also play an important
role, as the dominant source of super-Higgsing during inflation. This model presents an interesting
interplay of tuning considerations relating the electroweak hierarchy, cosmological constant
and inflationary superpotential, where maximal naturalness favors SUSY breaking near the electroweak
scale after inflation. The scalar superpartner of the axionic inflaton, the "sinflaton", can naturally
have $\sim$ Hubble mass during inflation and sufficiently strong coupling to the inflaton to mediate
primordial non-Gaussianities of observable strength in future 21-cm surveys. Non-minimal charged
fields under the higher-dimensional gauge symmetry can contribute to periodic modulations in
the CMB, within the sensitivity of ongoing measurements.
