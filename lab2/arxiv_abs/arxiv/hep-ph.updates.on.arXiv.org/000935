We have investigated how the wakes in the induced charge density and in the potential due to the passage
of highly energetic partons through a thermal QCD medium get affected by the presence of strong magnetic
field. For that purpose, we wish to analyze first the dielectric responses of the medium both in presence
and absence of strong magnetic field. Therefore, we have revisited the general form for the gluon
self-energy tensor at finite temperature and finite magnetic field and then calculate the relevant
structure functions at finite temperature and SMF limit. We found that for slow moving partons,
the real part of dielectric function is not affected by the magnetic field whereas for fast moving
partons, for small k, it becomes very large and approaches towards its counterpart at B = 0, for large
k. On the other hand the imaginary part is decreased for both slow and fast moving partons. With these
ingredients, we found that the oscillation in the induced charge density, due to the very fast partons
becomes less pronounced in the presence of strong magnetic field whereas for smaller parton velocity,
no significant change is observed. For the wake potential along the motion of fast moving partons,
the depth of negative minimum in the backward region gets reduced drastically, resulting the decrease
of amplitude of oscillation due to the strong magnetic field. On the other hand in the forward region,
it remains the screened Coulomb one, except the screening now becomes much stronger for higher parton
velocity. Similarly for the wake potential transverse to the motion of partons in both forward and
backward regions, the depth of potential for fast moving partons gets decreased severely, but still
retains the forward-backward symmetry. However, for lower parton velocity, the magnetic field
does not affect it significantly.
