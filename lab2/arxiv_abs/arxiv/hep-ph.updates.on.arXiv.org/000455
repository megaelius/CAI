A general approach to the construction of bound states in quantum field theory, called the renormalization
group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP), was applied recently to single heavy-flavor
QCD in order to study its utility beyond illustration of its general features. This heavy-flavor
QCD is chosen as the simplest available context in which the dynamics of quark and gluon bound states
can be studied with the required rigor using Minkowski-space Hamiltonian operators in the Fock
space, taking the advantage of asymptotic freedom. The effective quarks and gluons differ from
the point-like canonical ones by having a finite size $s$. Their size plays the role of renormalization
group parameter. However, instead of integrating out high-energy degrees of freedom, our RGPEP
procedure is based on a transformation of the front-form QCD Hamiltonian from its canonical form
with counterterms to the renormalized, scale-dependent operator that acts in the Fock space of
effective quanta of quark and gluon fields, keeping all degrees of freedom intact but accounting
for them in a transformed form. We discuss different behavior of effective particles interacting
at different energy scales, corresponding to different size s. Namely, we cover phenomena ranging
from asymptotic freedom at highest energies down to the scales at which the formation of bound states
occurs. We briefly present recent applications of the RGPEP to quarks and gluons in QCD, which have
been developed using expansion in powers of the Fock-space Hamiltonian running coupling. After
observing that the QCD effective Hamiltonian satisfies the requirement of producing asymptotic
freedom, we derive the leading effective interaction between quarks in heavy-flavor QCD. An effective
confining effect is derived as a result of assuming that the non-Abelian and non-perturbative dynamics
causes effective gluons to have mass.
