We explore the dark matter freeze-in mechanism within the gauge mediation framework, which involves
a hidden Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP) coupling feebly with the messenger fields
while the messengers are still in the thermal bath. The FIMP is the fermionic component of the pseudo-moduli
in a generic metastable supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking model and resides in the hidden sector. The
relic abundance and the mass of the FIMP are determined by the SUSY breaking scale and the feeble coupling.
The gravitino, which is the canonical dark matter candidate in the gauge mediation framework, contributes
to the dark matter relic abundance along with the freeze-in of the FIMP. The hidden sector thus becomes
two- component with both the FIMP and gravitino lodging in the SUSY breaking hidden sector. We point
out that the ratio between the FIMP and the gravitino is determined by how SUSY breaking is communicated
to the messengers. In particular when the FIMP dominates the hidden sector, the gravitino becomes
the minor contributor in the hidden sector. Meanwhile, the neutralino is assumed to be both the Weakly
Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter candidate in the freeze-out mechanism and the
Lightest Observable SUSY Particle (LOSP). We further find out the neutralino has the sub-leading
contribution to the current dark matter relic density in the parameter space of our freeze-in gauge
mediation (FIGM) model. Our result links the SUSY breaking scale in the gauge mediation framework
with the FIMP freeze-in production rate leading to a natural and predicting scenario for the studies
of the dark matter in the hidden sector.
