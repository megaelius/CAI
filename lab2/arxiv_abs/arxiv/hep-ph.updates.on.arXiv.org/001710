We study the event shape variables, transverse energy energy correlation TEEC $(\cos \phi)$ and
its asymmetry ATEEC $(\cos \phi)$ in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) at the electron-proton collider
HERA, where $\phi$ is the angle between two jets defined using a transverse-momentum $(k_T)$ jet
algorithm. At HERA, jets are defined in the Breit frame, and the leading nontrivial transverse energy
energy correlations arise from the 3-jet configurations. With the help of the NLOJET++, these functions
are calculated in the leading order (LO) and the next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations in
QCD at the electron-proton center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=314$ GeV. We restrict the angular
region to $-0.8 \leq \cos \phi \leq 0.8$, as the forward- and backward-angular regions require resummed
logarithmic corrections, which we have neglected in this work. Following experimental jet-analysis
at HERA, we restrict the DIS-variables $x$, $y=Q^2/(x s)$, where $Q^2=-q^2$ is the negative of the
momentum transfer squared $q^2$, to $0 \leq x \leq 1$, $0.2 \leq y \leq 0.6$, and the pseudo-rapidity
variable in the laboratory frame $(\eta^{\rm {lab}})$ to the range $-1 \leq \eta^{\rm {lab}} \leq
2.5$. The TEEC and ATEEC functions are worked out for two ranges in $Q^2$, defined by $5.5~{\rm GeV}^2
\leq Q^2 \leq 80~{\rm GeV}^2$, called the low-$Q^2$-range, and $150~{\rm GeV}^2 \leq Q^2 \leq 1000~{\rm
GeV}^2$, called the high-$Q^2$-range. We show the sensitivity of these functions on the parton
distribution functions (PDFs), the factorization $(\mu_F)$ and renormalization $(\mu_R)$ scales,
and on $\alpha_s(M_Z)$. Of these the correlations are stable against varying the scale $\mu_F$
and the PDFs, but they do depend on $\mu_R$. These studies are useful in the analysis of the HERA data,
including the determination of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ from the shape variables.
