Experiments at the LHC may yet discover a dijet resonance indicative of Beyond the Standard Model
(BSM) physics. In this case, the question becomes: what BSM theories are consistent with the unexpected
resonance? We examine models featuring a "colorphilic graviton"-- a hypothetical phenomenological
spin-2 color-singlet particle which couples exclusively to the quark and gluon stress-energy
tensors-- and assess the possibility of this state's discovery in the dijet channel as $s$-channel
resonances. We report the regions of parameter space where colorphilic gravitons have not yet been
excluded by LHC-13 dijet channel data but still may be discovered in the dijet channel at LHC-14 for
integrated luminosities of $0.3$, $1$, and $3$ ab$^{-1}$. We then delineate which of those regions
remain accessible to future collider searches, once one accounts for applicability of the narrow-width
approximation, mass resolution of the detector, and self-consistency according to tree-level
partial-wave unitarity. We discover that--despite the strong constraints unitarity imposes
on collider searches--the colorphilic graviton remains potentially discoverable in the LHC dijet
channel. We also apply the color discriminant variable, a dimensionless combination of quantities
(production cross-section, total decay width, and invariant mass) that can be quickly measured
after the discovery of a dijet resonance. Previous publications have demonstrated the color discriminant
variable's utility when applied to theories containing vector bosons (colorons, $Z^\prime$),
excited quarks, and diquarks. We conclude that resolvable, discoverable dijet resonances consistent
with colorphilic gravitons span a narrower range of masses than those consistent with leptophobic
$Z^\prime$ models, and can be distinguished from those originating from coloron, excited quark,
and diquark models.
