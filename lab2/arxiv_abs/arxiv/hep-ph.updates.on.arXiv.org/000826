The phenomenology of dark matter is complicated if dark matter is a composite particle as a hadron
under a dark gauge group. Once a dark parton is produced at a high energy collider, it showers and evolves
to a jet-like object, eventually it provides a collider signature depending on interactions with
particles of the Standard Model (SM). For example, a finite lifetime of dark hadron would provide
a displaced vertex. Thus by considering features in various subdetectors, one can identify a jet
from a dark parton ("dark jet") with analysis methods in conventional exotic searches. However
if the lifetime of the dark hadron is collider-negligible (too short to manifest a displaced vertex),
it would be hard to tag a dark jet over Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) jets of SM. Thus conventional
analyses with information from various sub-detectors are not enough to probe dark matter physics
in general at colliders. We propose an analysis to utilize a combination of jet-substructure variables
to identify dark jets over backgrounds. We study features of jet-substructure variables for a dark
jet. We identify what parameters in dark jet are relevant to performance of a given jet-substructure
variable. To maximize performance we apply a boost decision tree (BDT) to jet-substructure variables
in tagging dark QCD jet over QCD jets. As an illustration, we perform the LHC four-jet analysis with
/ without jet-substructure variables. Our result shows that by combining various jet-substructure
variables, one could get a good discrimination performance to identify a dark jet over QCD backgrounds.
We also discuss systematic uncertainties from the choice of parameters in a Monte Carlo simulation
in estimating tagging efficiency.
