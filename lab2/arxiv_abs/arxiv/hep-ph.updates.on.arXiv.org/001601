In this work, we make a detailed discussion on the phenomenology of the scotogenic Dirac model, which
could accommodate the Dirac neutrino mass and dark matter. We have studied the LFV processes in this
model, which are mediated by the charged scalar $\phi^\pm$ and heavy fermions $N_i$. The experimental
bounds, especially given by decays $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to 3e$, have put severe constraints
on Yukawa $y_\Phi$ and masses $m_{N1}$, $m_\phi$. We select the heavy fermion $N_1$ as dark matter
candidate and find the correct relic density is basically by annihilating through another Yukawa
$y_\chi$. After satisfying LFV and dark matter relic density constraints, we consider the indirect
detections of dark matter annihilating into leptons. But the constraints are relatively loose.
Then we make a detailed discussion on the dark matter direct detections. Although two Yukawa can
both contribute to the direct detection processes, more attention has been paid on the $y_\Phi$-related
processes as the $y_\chi$-related process is bounded loosely. The current and future direct detection
experiments have been used to set constraints on the Yukawas and masses. The current direct detections
bounds are relatively loose and can barely exclude more parameter region beyond the LFV. For the
future direct detection experiments, the excluding capacities can be improved due to larger exposures.
The detecting capabilities in the large mass region have not been weakened as the existence of mass
enhancement from the magnetic dipole operator $\mathcal{O}_{\rm mag.}$. At last, we briefly discuss
the collider signal searching in this model, the most promising signature is pair produced $\phi^+\phi^-$
and decay into signal of $\ell^+\ell^-+\not{\!\!E}_T$. The exclusion limits from collider on
$m_{N1}$ and $m_\phi$ have provided a complementary detecting capability compared to the LFV and
dark matter detections.
