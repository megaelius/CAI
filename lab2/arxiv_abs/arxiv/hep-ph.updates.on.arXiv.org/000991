Nonstatistical fluctuation in pseudorapidity ($\eta$), azimuthal ($\phi$), and pseudorapidity-azimuthal
($\eta-\phi$) distribution spectra of primary particles of PYTHIA Monash (default) generated
$pp$ events at $\sqrt{s}=$ 2.76, 7, and 13 TeV have been studied using the scaled factorial moments
technique. A weak intermittent type of emission could be realized for minimum-bias (MB) $pp$ events
in $\chi(\eta-\phi)$ space and a much stronger intermittency could be observed in high-multiplicity
(HM) $pp$ events in all $\chi(\eta)$, $\chi(\phi)$, and $\chi(\eta-\phi)$ spaces at all the studied
energies. For HM $pp$ events, at a particular energy, the intermittency index $\alpha_{q}$ is found
to be largest in two-dimensional $\chi(\eta-\phi)$ space and least in $\chi(\eta)$ space, and
no center of mass energy dependence of $\alpha_{q}$ could be observed. The anomalous dimensions
$d_{q}$ are observed to be increased with the order of the moment $q$, suggesting a multifractal
nature of the emission spectra of various studied events. While, the coefficient $\lambda_q$ is
found to decrease monotonically with the order of the moment $q$ for two-dimensional analysis of
MB $pp$ events as well as for one-dimensional analysis of HM $pp$ events, a clear minimum in $\lambda_q$
values could be observed from the two-dimensional HM $pp$ data analysis. For PYTHIA Monash generated
sets of data, the strength of the intermittency is found to vary significantly with the variation
of the strength of the color reconnection (CR) parameter, i.e., reconnection range RR, for RR = 0.0,
1.8 and 3.0, thereby, establishing a strong connection between the CR mechanism and the observed
intermittent type of emission of primary charged particles of the studied high-multiplicity $pp$
events.
