We have studied the $P\to\gamma^\star\gamma^\star$ transition form-factors ($P=\pi^0,\eta,\eta'$)
within a chiral invariant framework that allows us to relate the three form-factors and evaluate
the corresponding contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$, through pseudoscalar
pole contributions. We use a chiral invariant Lagrangian to describe the interactions between
the pseudo-Goldstones from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the massive meson resonances.
We will consider just the lightest vector and pseudoscalar resonance multiplets. Photon interactions
and flavor breaking effects are accounted for in this covariant framework. This article studies
the most general corrections of order $m_P^2$ within this setting. Requiring short-distance constraints
fixes most of the parameters entering the form-factors, consistent with previous determinations.
The remaining ones are obtained from a fit of these form-factors to experimental measurements in
the space-like ($q^2\le0$) region of photon momenta. The combination of data, chiral symmetry
relations between form-factors and high-energy constraints allows us to determine with improved
precision the on-shell $P$-pole contribution to the Hadronic Light-by-Light scattering of the
muon anomalous magnetic moment: we obtain $a_{\mu}^{P,HLbL}=(8.47\pm 0.16)\cdot10^{-10}$
for our best fit. This result was obtained excluding BaBar $\pi^0$ data, which our analysis finds
in conflict with the remaining experimental inputs. This study also allows us to determine the parameters
describing the $\eta-\eta'$ system in the two-mixing angle scheme and their correlations. Finally,
a preliminary rough estimate of the impact of loop corrections ($1/N_C$) and higher vector multiplets
(asym) enlarges the uncertainty up to $a_\mu^{P,HLbL} = (8.47\pm 0.16_{\rm sta}\pm0.09_{1/N_C}{}^{+0.5}_{-0.0}{}_{\rm
asym})\cdot 10^{-10}$.
