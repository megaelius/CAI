We explain all features of lepton and quark mixing in a scenario with the flavor symmetry Delta (384)
and a CP symmetry, where these are broken in several steps. The residual symmetry in the neutrino
and up quark sector is a Klein group and CP, while a Z_3 and a Z_{16} symmetry are preserved among charged
leptons and down quarks, respectively. If the Klein group in the neutrino sector is further broken
down to a single Z_2 symmetry, we obtain predictions for all lepton mixing parameters in terms of
one real quantity, whose size is determined by the value of the reactor mixing angle. The Dirac and
Majorana phases are fixed, in particular sin (delta) = -0.936. A sum rule, relating these CP phases
and the reactor and atmospheric mixing angles, theta_{13} and theta_{23}, is given. In the quark
sector, we have for the Cabibbo angle theta_C= sin (pi/16) = 0.195 after the first step of symmetry
breaking. This is brought into full accordance with experimental data with the second step of symmetry
breaking, where either the Z_{16} group is broken to a Z_8 symmetry in the down quark sector or the
Klein group to one Z_2 symmetry only among up quarks. The other two quark mixing angles are generated
in the third and last symmetry breaking step, when the residual symmetries in the up and/or down quark
sector are further broken. If this step occurs among both up and down quarks, the amount of CP violation
in the quark sector is determined by the lepton sector and explaining the current neutrino oscillation
data entails that the Jarlskog invariant J_{CP}^q is in very good agreement with experimental findings.
Lastly, a sum rule is derived that contains the CP phase delta^q and theta_C of the quark sector and
the lepton mixing parameters theta_{13}, theta_{23} and delta.
