Leptonic CP Violating Phase $ \delta_{CP} $ in the light neutrino sector and leptogenesis via present
matter antimatter asymmetry of the Universe entails each other. Probing CP violation in light neutrino
oscillation is one of the challenging tasks today. The reactor mixing angle $ \theta_{13} $ measured
in reactor experiments, LBL, DUNE with high precision in neutrino experiments indicates towards
the vast dimension of scope to detect $ \delta_{CP} $. The correlation between leptonic Dirac CPV
phase $ \delta_{CP} $, reactor mixing angle $ \theta_{13} $, lightest neutrino mass $ m_{1} $ and
matter antimatter asymmetry of the Universe within the framework of $ \mu-\tau $ symmetry breaking
assuming the type I seesaw dominance is extensively studied here. Small tiny breaking of the $ \mu-\tau
$ symmetry allows a large Dirac CP violating phase in neutrino oscillation which in turn is characterised
by awareness of measured value of $ \theta_{13} $ and to provide a hint towards a better understanding
of the experimentally observed near maximal value of $ \nu_{\mu} -\nu_{\tau} $ mixing angle $ \theta_{23}\simeq
\frac{\pi}{4}$. Precise breaking of the $ \mu-\tau $ symmetry is achieved by adding a 120 plet Higgs
to the 10 $+$ $\bar{126}$ dimensional representation of Higgs. The estimated three dimensional
density parameter space of lightest neutrino mass $ m_{1} $, $ \delta_{CP} $, reactor mixing angle
$ \theta_{13} $, is constrained here for the requirement of producing the observed value of baryon
asymmetry of the Universe through the mechanism of leptogenesis. Carrying out numerical analysis
the allowed parameter space of $ m_{1} $, $ \delta_{CP} $, $ \theta_{13} $, is found out which can produce
the observed baryon to photon density ratio of the Universe.
