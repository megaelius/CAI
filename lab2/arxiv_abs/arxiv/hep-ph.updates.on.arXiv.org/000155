In this short review, we present the current status about the theoretical and experimental studies
for some important semileptonic decays of $B/B_s$ mesons. We firstly gave a brief introduction
for the experimental measurements for $B/B_s \to P (l^+l^-, l^-\bar{\nu}_l, \nu \bar{\nu})$ decays,
the BaBar's $R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$ anomaly, the $P_5^\prime$ deviation for $B^0 \to K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$
decay. We then made a careful discussion about the evaluations for the relevant form factors in the
light-cone QCD sum rule (LCSRs), the heavy quark effective theory, and the perturbative QCD factorization
approach. By using the form factors calculated in the perturbative (pQCD) approach, we then calculate
and show the pQCD predictions for the decay rates of many semileptonic decays of $B/B_s$ mesons.
We also made careful phenomenological analysis for these pQCD predictions and found, in general,
the following points: (a) For all the considered $B/B_s$ semileptonic decays, the next-to-leading
order (NLO) pQCD predictions for their decay rates agree well with the data and those from other different
theoretical methods; (b) For $R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$, the pQCD predictions agree very well with the
data, the BaBar's anomaly of $R(D^{(*)})$ are therefore explained successfully in the standard
model by employing the pQCD approach; and (c) We defined several new ratios $R_D^{l,\tau}$ and $R_{D_s}^{l,\tau}$,
they may be more sensitive to the QCD dynamics which controls the $B/B_s \to (D^{(*)},D_s^{(*)})$
transitions than the old ratios, we therefore strongly suggest LHCb and the forthcoming Super-B
experiments to measure these new ratios.
