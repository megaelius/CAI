We investigate the charged-neutral pion self-energy difference at finite temperature. Within
Chiral Perturbation Theory we extend previous analysis in the chiral and soft pion limits. Our analysis
with physical masses leads to additional contributions for temperatures typical of a meson gas,
including a momentum-dependent function for the self energy. In addition, a nonzero imaginary
part arises, which we define consistently in the Coulomb gauge and comes from an infrared enhanced
contribution due to thermal bath photons. For distributions typical of a heavy-ion meson gas, the
charged and neutral pion masses and their difference depend on temperature through slowly increasing
functions. Chiral symmetry restoration is ultimately responsible for keeping the corrections
smooth and compatible with observed pion spectra. We study phenomenological effects related to
the electromagnetic damping leading to corrections for transport coefficients and neutral-charged
mean free times differences. An important aspect is the connection with chiral symmetry restoration
through the relation of the pion mass difference with the vector-axial spectral function difference,
which holds at $T=0$ due to a sum rule in the chiral and soft pion limits. We analyze the modifications
of that sum rule including nonzero pion masses and temperature, up to order $T^2$ and $M_\pi^2$.
Both effects produce terms making the pion mass difference grow against chiral-restoring decreasing
contributions. Finally, we analyze the corrections to the previous ChPT and sum rule results within
the resonance saturation framework at finite temperature, including explicitly $\rho$ and $a_1$
exchanges. Our results show that the ChPT result is robust at low and intermediate temperatures,
the leading corrections being of order $T^2 M_\pi^2/M_R^2$ with $M_R$ the involved resonance masses.
