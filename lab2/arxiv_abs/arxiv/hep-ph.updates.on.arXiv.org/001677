The prime goal of this thesis is to study anomalous gauge boson self couplings, triple gauge boson
couplings in particular, with the help of spin polarization observables of the gauge bosons $Z$
and $W^\pm$ in the presence of beam polarizations where ever possible. The neutral triple gauge
boson couplings, i.e., $ZZZ$, $ZZ\gamma$, $Z\gamma\gamma$, are studied in $ZZ/Z\gamma$ ($2lq\bar{q}/2l\gamma$)
production at an $e^+e^-$ collider with and without beam polarization. Some of these anomalous
couplings are also studied in $ZZ$ ($4l$) production at the LHC. In the charge sector the anomalous
gauge boson couplings, i.e., $WWZ$, $WW\gamma$ have been studied at an $e^+e^-$ collider in $W^+W^-$
($l^-\bar{\nu_l}q^\prime\bar{q}$) production. The $WWZ$ anomalous couplings are also studied
in $ZW^\pm$ production at LHC in $3l$ + missing $E_T$ channel. All the analyses at an $e^+$-$e^-$
collider have been performed for center-of-mass (CM) energy of $500$ GeV and integrated luminosity
of $100$ fb$^{-1}$. The analyses at the LHC are performed at $13$ TeV CM energy of $pp$ collisions.
The cross sections and polarization asymmetries, along with other asymmetries (forward-backward,
azimuthal), are used to obtain simultaneous limits on the anomalous couplings using Markov-Chain--Monte-Carlo
(MCMC) method in each process. The polarization asymmetries can distinguish between $CP$-even
and $CP$-odd couplings and help to put tighter constraints on the couplings. The polarization of
the initial $e^-$ and $e^+$ beam, in case of $e^+e^-$ collider, are used to increase the signal to
background ratio, putting tighter constraints on the anomalous couplings. The polarization asymmetries
are instrumental in the measurement of anomalous couplings should a deviation from the SM be observed.
