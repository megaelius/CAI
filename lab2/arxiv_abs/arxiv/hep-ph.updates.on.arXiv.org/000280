A new critical survey is presented of all half-life, decay-energy and branching-ratio measurements
related to 20 superallowed 0+ --> 0+ beta decays. Included are 222 individual measurements of
comparable precision obtained from 177 published references. Compared with our last review in
2008, we have added results from 24 new publications and eliminated 9 references, the results from
which having been superseded by much more precise modern data. We obtain world-average ft-values
for each of the eighteen transitions that have a complete set of data, then apply radiative and isospin-symmetry-breaking
corrections to extract corrected Ft values. Fourteen of these Ft values now have a precision of order
0.1% or better. In the process of obtaining these results we carefully evaluate the available calculations
of the isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections by testing the extent to which they lead to Ft values
consistent with conservation of the vector current (CVC). Only one set of calculations satisfactorily
meets this condition. The resultant average Ft value, when combined with the muon liftime, yields
the up-down quark-mixing element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, Vud = 0.97417
+/- 0.00021. The unitarity test on the top row of the matrix becomes |Vud|^2 + |Vus|^2 + |Vub|^2 = 0.99978
+/- 0.00055 if the Particle Data Group recommended value for Vus is used. However, recent lattice
QCD calculations, not included yet in the PDG evaluation, have introduced some inconsistency into
kaon-decay measurements of Vus and Vus/Vud. We examine the impact of these new results on the unitarity
test and conclude that there is no evidence of any statistically significant violation of unitarity.
Finally, from the Ft-value data we also set limits on the possible existence of scalar interactions.
