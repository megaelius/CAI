We report a comprehensive analysis of the light and strange disconnected-sea quarks contribution
to the nucleon magnetic moment, charge radius, and the electric and magnetic form factors. The lattice
QCD calculation includes ensembles across several lattice volumes and lattice spacings with one
of the ensembles at the physical pion mass. We adopt a model-independent extrapolation of the nucleon
magnetic moment and the charge radius. We have performed a simultaneous chiral, infinite volume,
and continuum extrapolation in a global fit to calculate results in the continuum limit. We find
that the combined light and strange disconnected-sea quarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic
moment is $\mu_M\,(\text{DI})=-0.022(11)(09)\,\mu_N$ and to the nucleon mean square charge
radius is $\langle r^2\rangle_E\,\text{(DI)}=-0.019(05)(05)$ fm$^2$ which is about $1/3$ of
the difference between the $\langle r_p^2\rangle_E$ of electron-proton scattering and that of
muonic atom and so cannot be ignored in obtaining the proton charge radius in the lattice QCD calculation.
The most important outcome of this lattice QCD calculation is that while the combined light-sea
and strange quarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment is small at about $1\%$, a negative
$2.5(9)\%$ contribution to the proton mean square charge radius and a relatively larger positive
$16.3(6.1)\%$ contribution to the neutron mean square charge radius come from the sea quarks in
the nucleon. For the first time, by performing global fits, we also give predictions of the light
and strange disconnected-sea quarks contributions to the nucleon electric and magnetic form factors
at the physical point and in the continuum and infinite volume limits in the momentum transfer range
of $0\leq Q^2\leq 0.5$ GeV$^2$.
