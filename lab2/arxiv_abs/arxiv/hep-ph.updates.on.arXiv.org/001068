Inspired by observation of the pentaquark states $P_{c}(4312),P_{c}(4440) $ and $P_{c}(4457)$
at LHCb, photoproductions of these three $P_{c}$ states via $\gamma p\rightarrow J/\psi p$ reaction
are investigated in an effective Lagrangian approach. The $t$-channel Pomeron exchange diffractive
process is considered as main background for the $J/\psi$ photoproductions. The numerical results
show that the theoretical cross section, which is calculated by assuming branching ratio $Br[P_{c}\rightarrow
J/\psi p]\simeq 3\%$, is consistent with the existent experimental data of the $\gamma p\rightarrow
J/\psi p$ process. With such branching ratio, if experimental precision reaches 0.1 nb within a
bin of 100 MeV for photon energy, two peaks are expected to be obviously observed in the $J/\psi$ photoproduction.
To observe the two-peak structure from $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$, higher precision, about 0.1nb/10MeV,
is required to distinguish two close pentaquarks. If the physical branching ratio is larger, the
requirement of experimental precision will be reduced. The differential cross sections for $\gamma
p\rightarrow J/\psi p$ reaction are also present. It is found that the $t$-channel Pomeron exchange
provides a sharp increase at extreme forward angles and give a sizable contribution at most energy
points, while the contributions from the $s$-channel $P_{c}$ exchanges play important roles at
threshold energies. The experimental measurement of the $\gamma p\rightarrow J/\psi p$ process
in near-threshold energy region around $E_{\gamma }\simeq 9.4-10.5$ GeV is suggested, which is
accessible at CEBAF@JLab and COMPASS.
