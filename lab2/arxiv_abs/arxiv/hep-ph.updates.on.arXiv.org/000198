Jet suppression is a powerful tool to explore the QCD medium created at RHIC and LHC experiments,
and mapping the medium properties requires accurately comparing experimental measurements with
jet suppression predictions. Generating suppression predictions is currently based on a range
of different approaches, which take into account the energy loss and medium evolution with varying
degrees of reality; the approaches also differ in a number of free parameters that they require,
which clearly impacts the prediction power. It is currently unclear what is the range of validity
for these different approaches, and accounting for that, requires comprehensively comparing
theoretical predictions with the available experimental data. To that end, we here develop a numerical
procedure for comparing jet suppression predictions, based on the dynamical energy loss formalism,
with available and upcoming {\it non-central collision data} at RHIC and LHC. The formalism is based
on state-of-the-art pQCD energy loss calculations, but does not explicitly take into account the
medium evolution; the model also requires no free parameters, which allows comparing its predictions
with experimental data in a direct and unbiased manner. We generate suppression predictions for
all available centrality ranges, for both RHIC and LHC experiments, which include charged hadrons,
neutral pions, D mesons and J/$\psi$s. We obtain very good agreement of these predictions with the
data, across different observables, centrality ranges, particle species and with no free parameters
used in model testing. These (and our previous) results strongly suggest that the medium evolution
is not a significant effect in the suppression predictions for hard probes.
