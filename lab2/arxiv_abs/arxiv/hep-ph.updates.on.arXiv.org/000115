Applying exact QCD sum rules for the baryon charge and energy-momentum we demonstrate that if nucleons
are the only degrees of freedom of nuclear wave function, the structure function of a nucleus would
be the additive sum of the nucleon distributions at the same Bjorken x = AQ^2/2(p_Aq)< 0.5 up to
very small Fermi motion corrections if x>0.05. Thus the difference of the EMC ratio from one reveals
the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei. Using exact QCD sum rules we show that
the ratio R_A(x_p,Q^2) used in experimental studies, where x_p = Q^2/2q_0 m_p deviates from one
even if a nucleus consists of nucleons with small momenta only. Use of the Bjorken x leads to additional
decrease of R_A(x,Q^2) as compared to the x_p plots. Coherent contribution of equivalent photons
into photon component of parton wave function of a nucleus unambiguously follows from Lorentz transformation
of the rest frame nucleus Coulomb field. For A~200 photons carry ~0.0065 fraction of the light momentum
of nucleus almost compensates the difference between data analysis in terms of Bjorken x and x_p.
Different role of higher twist effects for Q^2 probed at electron and muon beams is emphasized. Direct
observations of large and predominantly nucleonic short-range correlations in nuclei pose a serious
challenge for most of the models of the EMC effect for x>0.6. The data are consistent with a scenario
in which the hadronic EMC effect reflects fluctuations of inter nucleon interaction due to fluctuations
of color distribution in the interacting nucleons. The dynamic realization of this scenario is
the model in which the 3q (3qg) configurations with x > 0.5 parton have a weaker interaction with
nearby nucleons, leading to suppression of such configurations giving a right magnitude of the
EMC effect. The directions for the future studies and challenging questions are outlined.
