We study in a model independent way models of new Physics featuring extra quarks (XQs). These XQs
are predicted by extensions of the Standard Model (SM) but have never been observed yet even though
many searches have been designed to find them at the LHC. After an introduction about the SM and the
LHC, we present the main properties of these XQs and a model independent parametrisation that can
be used to describe their phenomenology with generic hypotheses about their mixing with SM quarks,
both in the case of XQ coupling with SM bosons and with Dark Matter (DM) candidates. In these cases
we study the offshellness effects in pair-production and decay and show that if the Narrow-Width
Approximation (NWA) is a good approximation of the full result in the small width over mass ratio
limit, sizeable differences occur when the XQ width becomes larger. The conclusion of our analysis
is that even though the small width assumption is always conservative it is not possible to trivially
rescale the mass bounds obtained considering processes of pair production and decay in the NWA to
determine constraints for XQs with large widths. We also study the role of interference in the process
of pair production of new heavy XQs decaying to SM particles and show that in the NWA the interference
contribution can be described by considering a parameter which contains only the relevant couplings
and the scalar part of the propagators of the new quarks, both at the cross section level and at the
distribution level. Finally, we study how various SUSY searches perform for our simplified model
with XQs decaying to DM. We show that the bound for XQs can be obtained from the SUSY ones just by rescaling
the exclusion with the XQ cross section.
