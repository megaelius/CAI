We revisit the cosmological constraints on resonant and non-resonant conversion of photons to
axions in the cosmological magnetic fields. We find that the constraints on photon-axion coupling
and primordial magnetic fields are much weaker than previously claimed for low mass axion like particles
with masses $m_{\rm a} \lesssim 5\times 10^{-13}\,\text{eV}$. In particular we find that the axion
mass range $10^{-14}\,\text{eV} \le m_{\rm a} \le 5\times 10^{-13}\,\text{eV}$ is not excluded
by the CMB data contrary to the previous claims. We also examine the photon-axion conversion in the
Galactic magnetic fields. Resonant conversion in the large scale coherent Galactic magnetic field
results in $100\%$ polarized anisotropic spectral distortions of the CMB for the mass range $10^{-13}\,\text{eV}
\lesssim m_{\rm a} \lesssim 10^{-11}\,\text{eV}$. The polarization pattern traces the transverse
to line of sight component of the Galactic magnetic field while both the anisotropy in the Galactic
magnetic field and electron distribution imprint a characteristic anisotropy pattern in the spectral
distortion. Our results apply to scalar as well as pseudoscalar particles. For conversion to scalar
particles, the polarization is rotated by $90^{\circ}$ allowing us to distinguish them from the
pseudoscalars. For $m_{\rm a} \lesssim 10^{-14} \,\text{eV}$ we have non-resonant conversion
in the small scale turbulent magnetic field of the Galaxy resulting in anisotropic but unpolarized
spectral distortion in the CMB. These unique signatures are potential discriminants against the
isotropic and non-polarized signals such as primary CMB, and $\mu$ and $y$ distortions with the
anisotropic nature making it accessible to experiments with only relative calibration like Planck,
LiteBIRD, and CORE. We forecast for PIXIE as well as for these experiments using Fisher matrix formalism.
