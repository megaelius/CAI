We examine several issues pertaining to statistical predictivity of the string theory landscape
for weak scale supersymmetry (SUSY). We work within a predictive landscape wherein super-renormalizable
terms scan while renormalizable terms do not. We require stringy naturalness wherein the likelihood
of values for observables is proportional to their frequency within a fertile patch of landscape
including the MSSM as low energy effective theory with a pocket-universe value for the weak scale
nearby to its measured value in our universe. In the string theory landscape, it is reasonable that
the soft terms enjoy a statistical power-law draw to large values, subject to the existence of atoms
as we know them (atomic principle). We argue that gaugino masses, scalar masses and trilinear soft
terms should each scan independently. In addition, the various scalars should scan independently
of each other unless protected by some symmetry. The expected non-universality of scalar masses--
once regarded as an undesirable feature-- emerges as an asset within the context of the string landscape
picture. In models such as heterotic compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds, where the tree-level
gauge kinetic function depends only on the dilaton, then gaugino masses may scale mildly, while
scalar masses and A-terms, which depend on all the moduli, may scale much more strongly leading to
a landscape solution to the SUSY flavor and CP problems in spite of non-diagonal K\"ahler metrics.
We present numerical results for Higgs and sparticle mass predictions from the landscape within
the generalized mirage mediation SUSY model and discuss resulting consequences for LHC SUSY and
WIMP dark matter searches.
