Small system collectivity observed at the LHC energies along with enhancement of strangeness makes
high-multiplicity proton+proton collisions very interesting in order to look for QGP-like features,
usually found in heavy-ion collisions. It may be interesting to perform a double differential study
of different observables in pp collisions in terms of charged particle multiplicity and event shape
in order to understand the new dimensions in high-multiplicity pp physics. We study the correlation
between the number of multi-partonic interactions (nMPI), event shape (transverse spherocity)
and charged particle multiplicity classes. We report the simulation results on the spherocity
and multiplicity dependent study of identified particle production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=
13 TeV using PYTHIA 8. We explore the event shape dependence of the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$)
spectra, integrated yield, mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\rm{T}} \rangle$) and particle
ratios of the identified particles. A clear spherocity dependence of $p_{\rm{T}}$-spectra is
observed for all the particles. The $p_{\rm T}$-crossing point of the ratios of jetty and isotropic
events to the spherocity-integrated ones, depend on the multiplicity classes. The p/$\phi$ ratio
at low-$p_{\rm T}$ shows a weak $p_{\rm T}$ dependence for high-multiplicity isotropic events,
which is a hydrodynamic-like behavior. Larger dependence of integrated yield on spherocity is
observed for high multiplicity compared to the low multiplicity pp collisions. However, the $p_{\rm{T}}$-integrated
particle ratio shows less dependence on spherocity which suggests that, the relative increase
in integrated yield for different particles as a function of spherocity are similar.
