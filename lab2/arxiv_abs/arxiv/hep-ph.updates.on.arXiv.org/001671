We propose a new mechanism for the formation of dark matter clumps in the radiation era. We assume
that a light scalar field oscillates harmonically. We include self-interactions and consider
the nonrelativistic regime, where the scalar dynamics are akin to the one of a fluid whose pressure
depends on both quantum and self-interaction effects. When the squared speed of sound of the scalar
fluid becomes negative, an instability arises and the fluctuations of the scalar energy-density
field start growing and eventually reach the nonlinear regime, where clumps form. Subsequently,
the clumps aggregate and reach a universal regime. We apply this mechanism to a model with a negative
quartic term stabilised by a positive self-interaction of order six, and then to axion monodromy,
where a subdominant cosine potential corrects a mass term. In the first case, the speed of sound squared
becomes negative when the quartic term dominates, leading to a tachyonic instability. For axion
monodromy, the instability starts very slowly. First, the density perturbations perform acoustic
oscillations due to the quantum pressure. Eventually, they start growing exponentially due to
a parametric resonance. The mass and size of the clumps depend crucially on their formation mechanisms.
When a tachyonic phase takes place, the core density of the clumps is uniquely determined by the energy
density at the beginning of the instability. For axion monodromy, the core density scales with the
soliton mass and radius. This difference comes from the role that the quantum pressure plays in the
parametric resonance and in balancing the self-interactions and gravity to form static scalar
solitons. In both scenarios, we find that the formation redshift of the scalar clumps can span a large
range in the radiation era from $10^{-2}$ to $10^4 \, {\rm GeV}$ and the scalar-field mass can be from
$10^{-18}$ GeV to $100$ GeV.
