The Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment has observed two air shower events
with energy $\sim 500~{\rm PeV}$ emerging from the Earth with exit angles $\sim 30^\circ$ above
the horizon. As was immediately noted by the ANITA Collaboration, these events (in principle) could
originate in the atmospheric decay of an upgoing $\tau$-lepton produced through a charged current
interaction of a $\nu_\tau$ inside the Earth. However, the relatively steep arrival angles of these
perplexing events create tension with the standard model (SM) neutrino-nucleon interaction cross
section. Deepening the conundrum, the IceCube neutrino telescope and the Pierre Auger Observatory
with substantially larger exposures to cosmic $\nu_\tau$'s in this energy range have not observed
any events. This lack of observation implies that the messenger particle (MP) giving rise to ANITA
events must produce an air shower event rate at least a factor of 40 larger than that produced by a flux
of $\tau$-neutrinos to avoid conflicts with the upper limits reported by the IceCube and the Pierre
Auger collaborations. In addition, the sensitivity of ANITA to MP-induced events must be comparable
to or larger than those of IceCube and Auger to avoid conflict with the non-observation of any signal
at these facilities. Beyond SM interpretations of ANITA events can be classified according to whether
the MPs: (i) live inside the Earth, (ii) originate in neutrino-nucleon collisions inside the Earth,
(iii) come from cosmological distances. In this communication we investigate the positive and
negative facets of these three classes of models.
