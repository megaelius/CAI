Tests of lepton-universality as rate ratios in $b\to s \ell\ell$ transitions can be predicted very
accurately in the Standard Model. The deficits with respect to expectations reported by the LHCb
experiment in muon-to-electron ratios of the $B\to K^{(*)}\ell\ell$ decay rates thus point to
genuine manifestations of lepton non-universal new physics. In this paper, we analyse these measurements
in the context of effective field theory. First, we discuss the interplay of the different operators
in $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$ and provide predictions for $R_{K^*}$ in the Standard Model and in new-physics
scenarios that can explain $R_K$. We also provide approximate numerical formulas for these observables
in bins of interest as functions of the relevant Wilson coefficients. Secondly, we perform frequentist
fits to $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^*}$. The SM disagrees with these measurements at $3.7\sigma$ significance.
We find excellent fits in scenarios with combinations of $\mathcal O_{9(10)}^\ell=\bar s\gamma^\mu
b_L~\ell\gamma_\mu(\gamma_5) \ell$ operators, with pulls relative to the Standard Model in the
region of $4\sigma$. An important conclusion of our analysis is that a lepton-specific contribution
to $\mathcal O_{10}$ is essential to understand the data. Under the hypothesis that new-physics
couples selectively to the muons, we also present fits to other $b\to s\mu\mu$ data with a conservative
error assessment, and comment on more general scenarios. Finally, we discuss new lepton universality
ratios that, if new physics is the origin of the observed discrepancy, should contribute to the statistically
significant discovery of new physics in the near future.
