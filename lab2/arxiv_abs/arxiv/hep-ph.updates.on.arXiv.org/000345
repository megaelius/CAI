We compute the in-medium partial decay widths of the bottomonium states to open bottom mesons ($B\bar
B$) using a field theoretical model for composite hadrons with quark constituents. These decay
widths are calculated by using the explicit constructions for the bottomonium states and the open
bottom mesons ($B$ and $\bar B$), and, the quark antiquark pair creation term of the free Dirac Hamiltonian
written in terms of the constituent quark field operators. These decay widths in the hadronic medium
are calculated as arising from the mass modifications of the bottomonium states and the $B$ and $\bar
B$ mesons, obtained in a chiral effective model. The decay amplitude in the present model is multiplied
with a strength parameter for the light quark pair creation, which is fitted from the observed vacuum
partial decay width of the bottomonium state, $\Upsilon (4S)$ to $B\bar B$. The effects of the isospin
asymmetry, the strangeness fraction of the hadronic matter on the decay widths, arising due to the
mass modifications due to these effects, have also been studied. There is observed to be appreciable
effects from density, and the effects from isospin asymmetry on the parital decay widths of $\Upsilon
\rightarrow B\bar B$ are observed to be quite pronounced at high densities. These effects should
show up in the asymmetric heavy ion collisions in Compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiments
planned at the future facility at FAIR. The study of the $\Upsilon$ states will, however, require
access to energies higher than the energy regime planned at the CBM experiment. The density effects
on the decay widths of the bottomonium states should show up in the production of these states, as
well as, in dilepton spectra at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies.
