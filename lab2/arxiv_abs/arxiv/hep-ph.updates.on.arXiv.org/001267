Spin correlations in the t-channel single top quark production and its subsequent decay are investigated
for the case of contributions involving anomalous Wtb couplings. We obtained analytical expressions
for the differential width for the three-particle decay of a polarized t-quark in its rest frame
and also expressions for the differential cross sections of the full process of production and decay
of the t-quark ($2\to 4$) as a function of the energy of a charged lepton and two angles of orientation
of the quantization axis of the t-quark spin. The expression is presented in the most general form
for the case of real and imaginary vector and tensor anomalous Wtb couplings. It is shown that shapes
of certain multidimensional kinematic distributions of final state particles are significantly
different for the contributions proportional to different combinations of the anomalous couplings.
The most noticeable differences appear in the shape of the surfaces of two-dimensional distributions,
where one of the variables is the energy of a charged lepton and the other is one of the t-quark spin
orientation angles. Observed properties are confirmed by two methods of computations either from
the obtained symbolic expression for the differential cross sections of full process of production
and decay of the t-quark or by means of the CompHEP program for the complete process involving the
t-channel single top. In addition, using the obtained analytical expressions, we estimate the
statistical accuracy of extracting values of the anomalous Wtb couplings for different levels
of the expected integral luminosity at the LHC.
