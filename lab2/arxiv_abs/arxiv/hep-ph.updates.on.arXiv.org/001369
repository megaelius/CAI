We study the reasonable requirements of two anomalous $U(1)$s in a flavored-axion framework for
the anomaly cancellations of both $U(1)$-mixed gravity and $U(1)_Y\times[U(1)]^2$ which in turn
determine the $U(1)_Y$ charges where $U(1)_Y$ is the hypercharge gauge symmetry of the standard
model. We argue that, with a flavor symmetry group, axion-induced topology in symmetry-broken
phases plays crucial roles in describing how quarks and leptons are organized at a fundamental level
and make deep connections with each other. A unified model, as an example, is then proposed in a simple
way to describe a whole spectrum of particles where both flavored-axion interactions with normal
matter and the masses and mixings of fermions emerge from the spontaneous breaking of a given symmetry
group. Once a scale of active neutrino mass defined at a seesaw scale is fixed by the commensurate
$U(1)$ flavored-PQ charges of fermions, that of QCD axion decay constant $F_A$ is determined. In
turn, fundamental physical parameters complementary to each other are predicted with the help
of precision flavor experiments and astrophysical observations. Model predictions are extracted
on the characteristics of neutrino and flavored-axion as a good candidate of dark matter: $F_A=3.05^{\,+1.01}_{\,-1.01}\times10^{10}$
GeV (consequently, QCD axion mass $m_a=1.78^{+0.88}_{-0.44}\times10^{-4}$ eV, and axion to
electron coupling $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}|=2.51^{+0.62}_{-1.24}\times10^{-14}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$,
etc.); atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$, and $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay
rate for normal mass ordering and inverted one by taking quantum corrections into account. Future
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches and/or precise measurement of $\theta_{23}$ will exclude or
favor the example model, giving predictions on $\delta_{CP}$ and mass orderings.
