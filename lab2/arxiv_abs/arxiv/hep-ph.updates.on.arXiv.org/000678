The kurtosis and skewness of net-baryon number fluctuations are studied for the magnetized phase
diagram of three-flavor quark matter within the Polyakov extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model.
Two models with magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis are considered. A special attention
is given to their behavior in the neighborhood of the light and strange critical end points CEPs.
Several isentropic trajectories that come close the CEPs are studied in order to analyze possible
signatures of a CEP in the presence of external magnetic fields. The effect of the magnetic field
on the velocity of sound, $v_s^2$, when both the light and strange CEPs are approached from the crossover
region are also investigate by calculating their temperature and baryon chemical potential dependencies
at fixed distances from these CEPs. Regions with large fluctuations but no CEP in non-magnetized
matter, develop a CEP under the action of a strong magnetic field. Besides, the Landau quantization
of the quark trajectories may result in the appearance of extra CEPs, in particular, in the strange
sector, identifiable by the net-baryon number fluctuations. Stiffer (smoother) fluctuations
in the region of the CEP are characteristic of models that do not predict (do predict) the IMC at zero
chemical potential. Particularly interesting is the ratio $\chi^4_B/\chi^2_B$ that has a more
pronounced peak structure, indicating that it is eventually a more convenient probe for the search
of CEP. The speed of sound shows a much richer structure in quark magnetized matter and allows to identify
both chiral and deconfinement transitions.
