We review and update our results for K-> pipi decays and K^0-\bar K^0 mixing obtained by us in the
1980s within an approach based on the dual representation of QCD as a theory of weakly interacting
mesons for large N colours. In our analytic approach the dynamics behind the enhancement of ReA_0
and suppression of ReA_2, the so-called Delta I = 1/2 rule for K-> pi pi decays, has a simple structure:
the usual octet enhancement through quark-gluon renormalization group evolution down to the scales
O(1 GeV) is continued as a meson evolution down to zero momentum scales at which the factorization
of hadronic matrix elements is at work. The inclusion of lowest-lying vector meson contributions
in addition to the pseudoscalar ones and of Wilson coefficients in a momentum scheme improves significantly
the matching between quark-gluon and meson evolutions. In particular, the anomalous dimension
matrix governing the meson evolution exhibits the structure of the known anomalous dimension matrix
in the quark-gluon evolution. The recent results on ReA_2 and ReA_0 from the RBC-UKQC collaboration
give support for our approach. In particular, the signs of the two main contractions found numerically
by these authors follow uniquely from our analytic approach. At NLO in 1/N we obtain ReA_0/ReA_2=
16.0\pm 1.5 which amounts to an order of magnitude enhancement over the strict large N limit value
sqrt{2}. QCD penguins contribute at 15% level to this result. We also find \hat B_K=0.73\pm 0.02,
with the smallness of 1/N corrections to the large N value \hat B_K=3/4 resulting within our approach
from an approximate cancellation between pseudoscalar and vector meson one-loop contributions.
We summarize the status of Delta M_K in this approach.
