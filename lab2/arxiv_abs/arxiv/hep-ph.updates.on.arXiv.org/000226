In this study, we investigate the phenomenological viability of the $Y=0$ Triplet Extended Supersymmetric
Standard Model (TESSM) with the current experimental Higgs data from ATLAS, CMS, and Tevatron,
as well as the low energy observable $\mathcal{B}r(B_s\to X_s \gamma)$. We scan numerically the
parameter space for data points generating the measured particle mass spectrum as well as satisfying
current direct search constraints on new particles. We require all the couplings to be perturbative
up to the scale $\Lambda_{\rm UV}=10^4$ TeV, by running them with newly calculated two loop beta
functions, and find that TESSM retains perturbativity as long as $\lambda$, the triplet coupling
to the two Higgs doublets, is smaller than 1.34 in absolute value. For $|\lambda|\gtrsim 0.8$ we
show that the fine-tuning associated to each viable data point can be greatly reduced as compared
to values attainable in MSSM. We also find that for perturbatively viable data points it is possible
to obtain either enhancement or suppression in $h\rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ decay rate depending
mostly on the relative sign between $M_2$ and $\mu_D$. Finally, we perform a fit by taking into account
48 Higgs physics observables along with $\mathcal{B}r(B_s\to X_s \gamma)$, for which we calculate
the NLO prediction within TESSM. We see that although naturality prefers a large $|\lambda|$, the
data, mostly because of the measured value of $\mathcal{B}r(B_s\to X_s \gamma)$, disfavors it
compared to the small $|\lambda|$ region. We notice, though, that this situation might dramatically
change with the second run of LHC at 14 TeV, in case either the ATLAS or CMS results, which respectively
observed a large enhancement and suppression in the Higgs decay channel to diphoton, are confirmed.
