In order to explore the generic properties of a backreaction model for explaining the accelerated
expansion of the Universe, we exploit two metrics to describe the late time Universe. Since the standard
FLRW metric cannot precisely describe the late time Universe on small scales, the template metric
with an evolving curvature parameter $\kappa_{\mathcal{D}}(t)$ is employed. However, we doubt
the validity of the prescription for $\kappa_{\mathcal{D}}$, which motivates us apply observational
Hubble parameter data (OHD) to constrain parameters in dust cosmology. First, for FLRW metric,
by getting best-fit constraints of $\Omega^{{\mathcal{D}}_0}_m = 0.25^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$, $n
= 0.02^{+0.69}_{-0.66}$, and $H_{\mathcal{D}_0} = 70.54^{+4.24}_{-3.97}\ {\rm km \ s^{-1} \
Mpc^{-1}}$, the evolutions of parameters are explored. Second, in template metric context, by
marginalizing over $H_{\mathcal{D}_0}$ as a prior of uniform distribution, we obtain the best-fit
values of $n=-1.22^{+0.68}_{-0.41}$ and ${{\Omega}_{m}^{\mathcal{D}_{0}}}=0.12^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$.
Moreover, we utilize three different Gaussian priors of $H_{\mathcal{D}_0}$, which result in
different best-fits of $n$, but almost the same best-fit value of ${{\Omega}_{m}^{\mathcal{D}_{0}}}\sim0.12$.
Also, the absolute constraints without marginalization of parameter are obtained: $n=-1.1^{+0.58}_{-0.50}$
and ${{\Omega}_{m}^{\mathcal{D}_{0}}}=0.13\pm0.03$. With these constraints, the evolutions
of the effective deceleration parameter $q^{\mathcal{D}}$ indicate that the backreaction can
account for the accelerated expansion of the Universe without involving extra dark energy component
in the scaling solution context. Nevertheless, the results also verify that the prescription of
$\kappa_{\mathcal{D}}$ is insufficient and should be improved.
