The Neutrino Astronomy seems to be finally discovered by a sudden flavor variations at several tens
Tev and by the recent, but unique, correlation between the IceCube-170922A trough going muon track
with the TXS 0506+056 gamma source. However, we believe that several expected signatures of a sharp
Neutrino Astronomy are still absent. We discuss such puzzles regarding the last ICECUBE neutrino
High Energy Starting Events (HESE) set. In this frame we note for energies greater than 90 TeV an intriguing
paucity of downward HESE muon tracks respect to the corresponding up-going ones. This happened
in the previous 82 events set and is still present in the last one of 103 events. Moreover, the rare
(just one or two) downward HESE tracks are much less numerous respect to the corresponding more abundant
downward showers. These missing HESE tracks are proposing either an up-down cosmic flavor anisotropy
(or anomaly), or more realistically, an asymmetry due to the role of ICECUBE veto for all downward
HESE tracks occurring with any nearby collinear muon companion. Companion muons that are absent
for any astrophysical events. About the tau double bang absence or paucity we present a discussion
on the nature of the detected tau events considering the last declared detector efficiency. In particular
we underline the unprobable (few percent) statistical location of the energy of the two tau event
candidates respect to the ICECUBE efficiency detection curve. We conclude that a dominant atmospheric
charmed neutrino (with a marginal astrophysical component) may better fit all the ICECUBE data.
It is proposed an approach that may found confirmations in the ICECUBE data with new disentangling
technique or in the next upgoing or horizontal tau air-shower detectors and rate.
