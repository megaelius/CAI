Leptonic CP Violating Phase $ \delta_{CP} $ in the light neutrino sector and leptogenesis via present
matter antimatter asymmetry of the Universe entails each other. Probing CP violation in light neutrino
oscillation has been one of the most challenging tasks in this precision era for neutrino Physics.
With the discovery potential of $ \theta_{13} $, the reactor mixing angle measured with high precision
in neutrino experiments indicates towards the vast dimension of scope to detect $ \delta_{CP} $.
The correlation between leptonic Dirac CPV phase $ \delta_{CP} $, reactor mixing angle $ \theta_{13}
$, lightest neutrino mass $ m_{1} $ and matter antimatter asymmetry of the Universe within the framework
of $ \mu-\tau $ symmetry breaking assuming the type I seesaw dominance is extensively studied here.
Small tiny breaking of the $ \mu-\tau $ symmetry allows a large Dirac CP violating phase in neutrino
oscillation which in turn is characterised by awareness of measured value of $ \theta_{13} $ and
to provide a hint towards a better understanding of the experimentally observed near maximal value
of $ \nu_{\mu} -\nu_{\tau} $ mixing angle $ \theta_{23}\simeq \frac{\pi}{4}$. Precise breaking
of the $ \mu-\tau $ symmetry is achieved by adding a 120 plet Higgs to the 10 $+$ $\bar{126}$ dimensional
representation of Higgs. The estimated three dimensional density parameter space of lightest
neutrino mass $ m_{1} $, $ \delta_{CP} $, reactor mixing angle $ \theta_{13} $, is constrained here
for the requirement of producing the observed value of baryon asymmetry of the Universe through
the mechanism of leptogenesis.
