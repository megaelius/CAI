We calculate in three-flavor lattice QCD the short-distance hadronic matrix elements of all five
$\Delta C=2$ four-fermion operators that contribute to neutral $D$-meson mixing both in and beyond
the Standard Model. We use the MILC Collaboration's $N_f = 2+1$ lattice gauge-field configurations
generated with asqtad-improved staggered sea quarks. We also employ the asqtad action for the valence
light quarks and use the clover action with the Fermilab interpretation for the charm quark. We analyze
a large set of ensembles with pions as light as $M_\pi \approx 180$ MeV and lattice spacings as fine
as $a\approx 0.045$ fm, thereby enabling good control over the extrapolation to the physical pion
mass and continuum limit. We obtain for the matrix elements in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$-NDR
scheme using the choice of evanescent operators proposed by Beneke \emph{et al.}, evaluated at
3 GeV, $\langle D^0|\mathcal{O}_i|\bar{D}^0 \rangle = \{0.0805(55)(16), -0.1561(70)(31),
0.0464(31)(9), 0.2747(129)(55), 0.1035(71)(21)\}~\text{GeV}^4$ ($i=1$--5). The errors shown
are from statistics and lattice systematics, and the omission of charmed sea quarks, respectively.
To illustrate the utility of our matrix-element results, we place bounds on the scale of CP-violating
new physics in $D^0$~mixing, finding lower limits of about 10--50$\times 10^3$ TeV for couplings
of $\mathrm{O}(1)$. To enable our results to be employed in more sophisticated or model-specific
phenomenological studies, we provide the correlations among our matrix-element results. For
convenience, we also present numerical results in the other commonly-used scheme of Buras, Misiak,
and Urban.
