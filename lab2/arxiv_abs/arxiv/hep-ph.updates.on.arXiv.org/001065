Starting from a Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework, based on a running-coupling improved $k_T$-factorized
formula, we calculate bulk observables in several heavy-ion collision systems. This is done in
two ways: first we calculate the particle distribution directly implied from the CGC model, and
we compare this to the case where it is instead used as initial conditions for a hybrid hydrodynamic
simulation. In this way, we can assess the effects of hydrodynamic and hadronic evolution by quantifying
how much they change the results from a pure initial state approach and, therefore, to what extent
initial condition models can be directly compared to experimental data. We find that entropy production
in subsequent hydrodynamic evolution can increase multiplicity by as much as 50\%. However, disregarding
a single overall normalization factor, the centrality, energy, and system size dependence of charged
hadron multiplicity is only affected at the $\sim$5\% level. Because of this, the parameter-free
prediction for these dependencies gives reasonable agreement with experimental data whether
or not hydrodynamic evolution is included. On the other hand, our model results are not compatible
with the hypothesis that hydrodynamic evolution is present in large systems, but not small systems
like p-Pb, in which case the dependence of multiplicity on system size would be stronger than seen
experimentally. Moreover, we find that hydrodynamic evolution significantly changes the distribution
of momentum, so that observables such as mean transverse momentum are very different from the initial
particle production, and much closer to measured data. Finally, we find that a good agreement to
anisotropic flow data cannot be achieved due to the large eccentricity generated by this model.
