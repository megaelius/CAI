In this paper, we use the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the proper time regularization
to study the finite-volume effects of QCD chiral phase transition. Within a cubic volume of finite
size $L$, we choose the stationary wave condition (SWC) as the real physical spatial boundary conditions
of quark fields and compare our results with that by means of commonly used (anti-)period boundary
condition (APBC or PBC). It is found that the results by means of SWC are obviously different to the
results from the APBC or PBC. Although the three boundary conditions give the same chiral crossover
transition curve in the infinite volume limit, the limit size $L_0$ (when $L\geq L_{0}$, the chiral
quark condensate $-\left\langle { \bar \psi \psi} \right\rangle_L$ is indistinguishable from
that at $L=\infty$) using SWC is $L_0\approx 500$ fm which is much larger than the results obtained
using APBC or PBC. More importantly, $L_0\approx 500$ fm is also much large than the typical size
of the quark-gluon plasma produced by the relativistic heavy ion collisions. This means that the
finite volume effects play a very important role in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions. In addition,
we also found that when $L\leq 2$ fm, even at zero temperature the chiral symmetry is effectively
restored. Furthermore, to quantitatively reflect the finite volume effects on the QCD chiral phase
transition, we introduce a new vacuum susceptibility, $\chi_{1/L}(T)=-\frac{\partial \left\langle
{ \bar \psi \psi} \right\rangle}{\partial (1/L)}$. With this new vacuum susceptibility, it is
very interesting to find $\chi_{1/L}(T=0)=\chi_{1/L}(T=1/L)$ for SWC.
