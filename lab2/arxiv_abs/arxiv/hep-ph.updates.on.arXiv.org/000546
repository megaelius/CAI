We present a general study of 3-point functions of conformal field theory in momentum space, following
a reconstruction method for tensor correlators, based on the solution of the conformal Ward identities
(CWI' s), introduced in recent works by Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis (BMS). We investigate and
detail the structure of the CWI's and their non-perturbative solutions, and compare them to perturbation
theory, taking QED as an example. In a first part we address in full generality some methodological
issues emerging when re-expressing the conformal generators in momentum space from position space,
filling a gap in the related literature. Such are the violation of the Leibniz rule and the treatment
of the derivative of the Dirac $\delta$ terms related to conservation of the total momentum, induced
by the Fourier transform. We present a complete discussion of this transition. We then proceed with
an analysis of the $TJJ$ correlator, presenting independent and detailed re-derivations of the
conformal equations in the reconstruction method of BMS, originally formulated using a minimal
tensor basis in the transverse traceless sector. Our results are then exemplified in massless QED
at one-loop in $d$-dimensions expressed in terms of master integrals. The action of the conformal
generators on the $TJJ$ in $d$-dimensions is directly worked out on the corresponding master integrals.
We show how the conformal constraints are explicitly imposed and solved in such perturbative realization
of the conformal equations in their exact $d$-dimensional form and in their anomalous forms in $d=4$
after renormalization.
