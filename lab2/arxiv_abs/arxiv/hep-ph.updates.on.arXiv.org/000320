Search for new physics events at the LHC mostly rely on the assumption that the events are characterized
in terms of standard-reconstructed objects such as isolated photons, leptons, and jets initiated
by QCD-partons. While such strategy works for a vast majority of physics beyond the standard model
scenarios, there are examples aplenty where new physics give rise to anomalous objects (such as
collimated and equally energetic particles, decays due to long lived particles etc.) in the detectors,
which can not be classified as any of the standard-objects. Varied methods and search strategies
have been proposed, each of which is trained and optimized for specific models, topologies, and
model parameters. Further, as LHC keeps excluding all expected candidates for new physics, the
need for a generic method/tool that is capable of finding the unexpected can not be understated.
In this paper, we propose one such method that relies on the philosophy that all anomalous objects
are $\it{not}$ standard-objects. The anomaly finder, we suggest, simply is a collection of vetoes
that eliminate all standard-objects upto a pre-determined acceptance rate. Any event containing
at least one anomalous object (that passes all these vetoes), can be identified as a candidate for
new physics. Subsequent offline analyses can determine the nature of the anomalous object as well
as of the event, paving a robust way to search for these new physics scenarios in a model-independent
fashion. Further, since the method relies on learning only the standard-objects, for which control
samples are readily available from data, one can build the analysis in an entirely data-driven way.
