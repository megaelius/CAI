We investigate the various distributions explaining multi-dimensional structure of kaon at the
level of its constituents ($u$ and $\bar{s}$) using the light-cone quark model. The overlap form
of wavefunctions associated with the light-cone quark model is adopted for the calculations. The
generalized parton distributions(GPDs)of $u$ and $\bar{s}$ quarks are presented for the case
when the momentum transfer in the longitudinal direction is non-zero. The dependence of kaon GPDs
is studied in terms of variation of quark longitudinal momentum fraction, momentum transfer in
longitudinal direction and total momentum transfer to the final state of hadron. The transverse
impact-parameter dependent GPDs are also studied by taking the Fourier transformation of general
GPDs. Further, the quantum phase-space distributions; Wigner distributions are studied for the
case of unpolarized, longitudinally-polarized and transversely-polarized parton in an unpolarized
kaon. The Wigner distributions are analysed in the transverse impact-parameter plane, the transverse
momentum plane and the mixed plane. Further, to get a complete picture of kaon in terms of its valence
quarks, the variation of longitudinal momentum fraction carried by quark and antiquark in the generalized
transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) is studied for different values
of transverse quark and antiquark momentum $({\bf k}_\perp)$ as well as for different values of
momentum transferred to the kaon in transverse direction $({\bf \Delta}_\perp)$. This has been
done for zero as well as non-zero skewedness representing respectively the absence and presence
of momentum transfer to the final state of kaon in longitudinal direction. Furthermore, the possible
spin-orbit correlation for $u$ and $\bar{s}$ in kaon is elaborated in context of Wigner distributions
and GTMDs.
