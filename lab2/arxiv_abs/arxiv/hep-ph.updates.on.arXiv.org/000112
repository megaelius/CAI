Very intense neutrino beams and large neutrino detectors will be needed in order to enable the discovery
of CP violation in the leptonic sector. We propose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation
Source currently under construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation
neutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance neutrino beam. The baseline
program for the European Spallation Source linac is that it will be fully operational at 5 MW average
power by 2022, producing 2 GeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade
the linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron production and 14 pulses/s
for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the high current required in the pulsed neutrino
horn, the length of the pulses used for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\mu$s
with the aid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam and a megaton
underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines 300-600 km from Lund will make it
possible to discover leptonic CP violation at 5 $\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic
Dirac CP-violating phase range. This experiment could also determine the neutrino mass hierarchy
at a significance level of more than 3 $\sigma$ if this issue will not already have been settled by
other experiments by then. The mass hierarchy performance could be increased by combining the neutrino
beam results with those obtained from atmospheric neutrinos detected by the same large volume detector.
This detector will also be used to measure the proton lifetime, detect cosmological neutrinos and
neutrinos from supernova explosions. Results on the sensitivity to leptonic CP violation and the
neutrino mass hierarchy are presented.
