This work deals with form factors of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of spin-0 particles and the
unknown particle property D-term related to the EMT, and is divided into three parts. The first part
explores free, weakly and strongly interacting theories to study EMT form factors with the following
findings. (i) The free Klein-Gordon theory predicts for the D-term D = -1. (ii) Even infinitesimally
small interactions can drastically impact D. (iii) In strongly interacting theories one can encounter
large negative D though notable exceptions exist, which includes Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry
breaking. (iv) Contrary to common belief one cannot arbitrarily add "total derivatives" to the
EMT. Rather the EMT must be defined in an unambiguous way. The second part deals with the interpretation
of EMT form factors in terms of 3D-densities with following results. (i) The 3D-density formalism
is internally consistent. (ii) The description is subject to relativistic corrections which are
acceptably small in phenomenologically relevant situations including nucleon and nuclei. (iii)
The free field result D=-1 persists when a spin-0 boson is not point-like but "heuristically given
some internal structure." The third part investigates the question, whether such "giving of an
extended structure" can be implemented dynamically, and has the following insights. (i) We construct
a consistent microscopic theory which, in a certain parametric limit, interpolates between extended
and point-like solutions. (ii) This theory is exactly solvable which is rare in 3+1 dimensions,
admits non-topological solitons of Q-ball-type, and has a Gaussian field amplitude. (iii) The
interaction of this theory belongs to a class of logarithmic potentials which were discussed in
literature, albeit in different contexts including beyond standard model phenomenology, cosmology,
and Higgs physics.
