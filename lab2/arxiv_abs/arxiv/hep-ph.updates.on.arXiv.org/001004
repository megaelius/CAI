We review scenarios in which the particles that account for the Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe interact
only through their couplings with the Higgs sector of the theory, the so-called Higgs-portal models.
In a first step, we use a general and model-independent approach in which the DM particles are singlets
with spin $0,\frac12$ or $1$, and assume a minimal Higgs sector with the presence of only the Standard
Model (SM) Higgs particle observed at the LHC. In a second step, we discuss non-minimal scenarios
in which the spin-$\frac12$ DM particle is accompanied by additional lepton partners and consider
several possibilities like sequential, singlet-doublet and vector-like leptons. In a third step,
we examine the case in which it is the Higgs sector of the theory which is enlarged either by a singlet
scalar or pseudoscalar field, an additional two Higgs doublet field or by both; in this case, the
matter content is also extended in several ways. Finally, we investigate the case of supersymmetric
extensions of the SM with neutralino DM, focusing on the possibility that the latter couples mainly
to the neutral Higgs particles of the model which then serve as the main portals for DM phenomenology.
In all these scenarios, we summarize and update the present constraints and future prospects from
the collider physics perspective, namely from the determination of the SM Higgs properties at the
LHC and the search for its invisible decays into DM, and the search for heavier Higgs bosons and the
DM companion particles at high-energy colliders. We then compare these results with the constraints
and prospects obtained from the cosmological relic abundance as well as from direct and indirect
DM searches in astroparticle physics experiments. The complementarity of collider and astroparticle
DM searches is investigated in all the considered models.
