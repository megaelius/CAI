Scattering amplitudes at weak coupling are highly constrained by Lorentz invariance, locality
and unitarity, and depend on model details only through coupling constants and particle content.
In this paper, we develop an understanding of inflationary correlators which parallels that of
flat-space scattering amplitudes. Specifically, we study slow-roll inflation with weak couplings
to extra massive particles, for which all correlators are controlled by an approximate conformal
symmetry on the boundary of the spacetime. After classifying all possible contact terms in de Sitter
space, we derive an analytic expression for the four-point function of conformally coupled scalars
mediated by the tree-level exchange of massive scalars. Conformal symmetry implies that the correlator
satisfies a pair of differential equations with respect to spatial momenta, encoding bulk time
evolution in purely boundary terms. The absence of unphysical singularities completely fixes
this correlator. A spin-raising operator relates it to the correlators associated with the exchange
of particles with spin, while weight-shifting operators map it to the four-point function of massless
scalars. We explain how these de Sitter four-point functions can be perturbed to obtain inflationary
three-point functions. We reproduce many classic results in the literature and provide a complete
classification of all inflationary three- and four-point functions arising from weakly broken
conformal symmetry. The inflationary bispectrum associated with the exchange of particles with
arbitrary spin is completely characterized by the soft limit of the simplest scalar-exchange four-point
function of conformally coupled scalars and a series of contact terms. Finally, we demonstrate
that the inflationary correlators contain flat-space scattering amplitudes via a suitable analytic
continuation of the external momenta.
