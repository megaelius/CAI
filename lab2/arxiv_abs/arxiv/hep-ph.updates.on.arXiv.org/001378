The class of higher-dimensional scenarios, based on a brane-localised Higgs boson coupled to bulk
fermions, can address both the flavour puzzle and gauge hierarchy problem. A key question arises
due to the possibility of fermion profile discontinuities at the Higgs boundary: how to calculate
rigorously the fermion mass spectrum and effective four-dimensional (4D) Yukawa couplings? We
show that the proper treatment, leading to physically consistent solutions, does not rely on any
Higgs peak regularisation but requires the presence of certain Bilinear Brane Terms (BBT). In particular,
no profile jump should appear and the Higgs regularisations turn out to suffer from mathematical
discrepancies reflected in two non-commutativities of calculation steps debated in the literature.
The introduction of BBT can by replaced by vanishing conditions for probability currents at the
considered flat interval boundaries. Both contribute to the definition of the field geometrical
configuration of the model, even in the free case. The BBT could allow to elaborate an ultra-violet
origin of the chiral nature of the Standard Model and of its chirality distribution among quarks/leptons.
The current conditions are implemented via essential boundary conditions to be contrasted with
the natural boundary conditions derived from the action variation. All these theoretical conclusions
are confirmed in particular by the converging exact results of the 4D versus 5D approaches. The analysis
is completed by a description of the appropriate energy cut-off procedure. The new calculation
methods presented, implying the independence of excited fermion masses and 4D Yukawa couplings
on the 'wrong-chirality' Yukawa terms, have impacts on phenomenological results like the relaxing
of previously obtained strong bounds on Kaluza-Klein masses induced by flavour changing reactions
generated through exchanges of the Higgs field.
