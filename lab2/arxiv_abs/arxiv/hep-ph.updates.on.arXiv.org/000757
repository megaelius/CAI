The future 100-km circular collider FCC at CERN is planned to operate in one of its modes as an electron-positron
FCC-ee machine. We give an overview of the theoretical status compared to the experimental demands
of one of four foreseen FCC-ee operating stages, which is Z-boson resonance energy physics, FCC-ee
Tera-Z stage for short. The FCC-ee Tera-Z will deliver the highest integrated luminosities as well
as very small systematic errors for a study the Standard Model (SM) with unprecedented precision.
In fact, the FCC-ee Tera-Z will allow to study at least one more quantum field theoretical perturbative
order compared to the LEP/SLC precision. The real problem is that the present precision of theoretical
calculations of the various observables within the SM does not match that of the anticipated experimental
measurements. The bottle-neck problems are specified. In particular, the issues of precise QED
unfolding and of the correct calculation of SM pseudo-observables are critically reviewed. In
an Executive Summary we specify which basic theoretical calculations are needed to meet the strong
experimental expectations at the FCC-ee Tera-Z. Several methods, techniques and tools needed
for higher order multi-loop calculations are presented. By inspection of the Z-boson partial and
total decay widths analysis, arguments are given that at the beginning of operation of the FCC-ee
Tera-Z, the theory predictions may be tuned to be precise enough not to limit the physics interpretation
of the measurements. This statement is based on the anticipated progress in analytical and numerical
calculations of multi-loop and multi-scale Feynman integrals and on the completion of two-loop
electroweak radiative corrections to the SM pseudo-observables this year. However, the above
statement is conditional as the theoretical issues demand a very dedicated and focused investment
by the community.
