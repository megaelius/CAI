The productions of inclusive b-jet and $b\bar{b}$ dijets in Pb+Pb collisions have been investigated
by considering the heavy quark and the light quark in-medium evolution simultaneously. The initial
hard processes of inclusive b-jet and $b\bar{b}$ dijets productions are described by a next-to-leading
order (NLO) plus parton shower Monte Carlo (MC) event generator SHERPA which can be well matched
with the experimental data in p+p collisions. The framework combines the Langevin transport model
to describe the evolution of bottom quark also its collisional energy loss and the higher-twist
description to consider the radiative energy loss of both bottom and light quarks. We compare the
theoretical simulation of inclusive jet and inclusive b-jet $R_{\rm AA}$ in Pb+Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{S_{\rm NN}}=2.76$~TeV with the experimental data, and then present the theoretical simulation
of the momentum balance of the $b\bar{b}$ dijet in Pb+Pb collisions at $5.02$~TeV with the recent
CMS data for the first time. A similar trend as that in dijets has been observed in $b\bar{b}$ dijets,
the production-distribution shifted to smaller $x_J$ due to the jet quenching effect. At last,
the prediction of the normalized azimuthal angle distribution of the $b\bar{b}$ dijet in Pb+Pb
collisions at $5.02$ TeV has been reported. The medium induced energy loss effect of the $b\bar{b}$
dijets will overall suppress its production, but the near side ($\Delta \phi \to 0$ region) suffers
more energy loss than away side ($\Delta \phi \to \pi$ region), therefore lead to the suppression
on the near side and the enhancement on the away side in the normalized azimuthal angle distribution.
