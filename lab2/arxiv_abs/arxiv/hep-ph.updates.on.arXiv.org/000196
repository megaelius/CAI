We describe the evolution of Dark Matter (DM) abundance from the very onset of its creation from inflaton
decay under the assumption of an instantaneous reheating. Based on the initial conditions such
as the inflaton mass and its decay branching ratio to DM, reheating temperature, and the DM mass and
interaction rate with the thermal bath, the DM particles can either thermalize (fully/partially)
with the primordial bath or remain non-thermal throughout their evolution history. In the thermal
case, the final abundance is set by the standard freeze-out mechanism for large annihilation rates,
irrespective of the initial conditions. For smaller annihilation rates, it can be set by the freeze-in
mechanism, also independent of the initial abundance, provided it is small to begin with. For even
smaller interaction rates, the DM decouples while being non-thermal, and the relic abundance will
be essentially set by the initial conditions. We put model-independent constraints on the DM mass
and annihilation rate from over-abundance by exactly solving the relevant Boltzmann equations,
and identify the thermal freeze-out, freeze-in and non-thermal regions of the allowed parameter
space. We highlight a generic fact that inflaton decay to DM inevitably leads to an overclosure of
the Universe for a large range of DM parameter space, and thus poses a stringent constraint that must
be taken into account while constructing models of DM. For the thermal DM region, we also show the
complementary constraints from indirect DM search experiments, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic
Microwave Background, Planck measurements, and theoretical limits due to the unitarity of S-matrix.
For the non-thermal DM scenario, we show the allowed parameter space in terms of the inflaton and
DM masses for a given reheating temperature, and compute the comoving free-streaming length to
identify the hot, warm and cold DM regimes.
