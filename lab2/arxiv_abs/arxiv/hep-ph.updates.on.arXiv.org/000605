Solutions and their evolutions of the quark gap equation are studied in this work, especially the
Wigner solution, which is a basic issue for studying the QCD phase structure and locating the possible
CEP. Chiral symmetry plays important roles for our understanding of the origin of mass and evolution
of the Universe. Previously, people think that only in the chiral limit case of the vacuum will the
Nambu and the Wigner solutions coexist, while beyond the chiral limit the Wigner solution will immediately
disappear. With the help of the NJL model, we find that in the chiral limit case of the vacuum, chiral
symmetry will not be broken if the coupling strength is smaller than a critical value, and then the
system only has the Wigner solution. If we increase the coupling strength, two symmetric minima
would appear as the positive and "negative" Nambu solutions, however the solution $M=0$ now corresponds
to a maximum instead of a minimum of the thermodynamical potential, so is not a physically stable
state but a mathematical solution, or "pseudo-Wigner solution". Furthermore, we have checked
the parameter dependence of the solutions. It is shown that as the current quark mass increases,
the pseudo-Wigner solution will become negative, and disappear together with the negative Nambu
solution if the current quark mass is large enough. Similar things will happen if we increase the
temperature or quark chemical potential $\mu$. Some interesting phenomenon is, from some $\mu$
a second local minimum will show up, which of course means a new meta-stable phase. If $\mu$ is large
enough, it will be more stable than the Nambu solution, and it still survives even the Nambu solution
disappears for high $\mu$. Furthermore, it decreases and approaches the current quark mass gradually
as $\mu$ increases, so can be regarded as the Wigner solution we need.
