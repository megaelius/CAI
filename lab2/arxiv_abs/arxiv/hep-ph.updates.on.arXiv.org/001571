We present a non-extensive version of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model which is based on
the non-extentive statistical mechanics. This new statistics is characterized by a dimensionless
non-extensivity parameter $q$ that accounts for all possible effects violating the assumptions
of the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics (when $q\rightarrow1$, it returns to the Boltzmann-Gibbs case).
Using this q-Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and including two different Polyakov-loop potentials,
we discussed the influence of the parameter $q$ on chiral and deconfinement phase transition, various
thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients at finite temperature and zero quark chemical
potential. We found that the Stefan-Boltzmann limit is actually related to the choice of statistics.
For example, in the Tsallis statistics, the thermodynamic quantities $\frac{\epsilon}{T^{4}}$,
$\frac{p}{T^{4}}$ and $\frac{s}{T^{3}}$ all increase with $q$, exceed their usual Stefan-Boltzmann
limits and tend to a new $q$-related Tsallis limit at temperature high enough. Interestingly, however,
due to a surprising cancellation, the high temperature limit of $c_{s}^{2}$ is still its SB limit
$1/3$. In addition, we found some similarities between the non-extensive effect and the finite-size
effect. For example, as $q$ increases (size decreases), the criticality of $\frac{c_{v}}{T^{3}}$
and $c_{s}^{2}$ gradually disappears. Besides, in order to better study the non-extensive effect,
we defined a new susceptibility and calculated the response of thermodynamic quantities and transport
coefficients to $q$. And found that their response patterns are different.
