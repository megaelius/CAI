Various new measurements in charmless $B_{u,d,s}\to PP$ modes, where $P$ is a low lying pseudoscalar
meson, are reported by Belle and LHCb. These include the rates of $B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$, $\eta\pi^0$,
$B_s\to\eta'\eta'$, $B^0\to K^+K^-$ and $B^0_s\to\pi^+\pi^-$ decays. Some of these modes are
highly suppressed and are among the rarest $B$ decays. Direct CP asymmetries on various modes are
constantly updated. It is well known that direct CP asymmetries and rates of suppressed modes are
sensitive to final state interaction (FSI). As new measurements are reported and more data will
be collected, it is interesting and timely to revisit the rescattering effects in $B_{u,d,s}\to
PP$ states. We perform a $\chi^2$ analysis with all available data on CP-averaged rates and CP asymmetries
in $\overline B{}_{u,d,s}\to PP$ decays. Our numerical results are compared to data and those from
factorization approach. The quality of the fit is improved significantly from the factorization
results in the presence of rescattering. The relations on topological amplitudes and rescattering
are explored and they help to provide a better understanding of the effects of FSI. As suggested by
U(3) symmetry on topological amplitudes and FSI, a vanishing exchange rescattering scenario is
considered. The exchange, annihilation, $u$-penguin, $u$-penguin annihilation and some electroweak
penguin amplitudes are enhanced significantly via annihilation and total annihilation rescatterings.
In particular, the $u$-penguin annihilation amplitude is sizably enhanced by the tree amplitude
via total annihilation rescattering. These enhancements affect rates and CP asymmetries. Predictions
can be checked in the near future.
