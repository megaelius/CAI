Assuming that new physics effects are parametrized by the Standard-Model Effective Field Theory
(SMEFT) written in a complete basis of up to dimension-6 operators, we calculate the CP-conserving
one-loop amplitude for the decay $h\to \gamma\gamma$ in general $R_\xi$-gauges. We employ a simple
renormalisation scheme that is hybrid between on-shell SM-like renormalised parameters and running
$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ Wilson coefficients. The resulting amplitude is then finite, renormalisation
scale invariant, independent of the gauge choice ($\xi$) and respects SM Ward identities. Remarkably,
the $S$-matrix amplitude calculation resembles very closely the one usually known from renormalisable
theories and can be automatised to a high degree. We use this gauge invariant amplitude and recent
LHC data to check upon sensitivity to various Wilson coefficients entering from a more complete
theory at the matching energy scale. We present a closed expression for the ratio $\mathcal{R}_{h\to
\gamma\gamma}$, of the Beyond the SM versus the SM contributions as appeared in LHC $h\to \gamma\gamma$
searches. The most important contributions arise at tree level from the operators $Q_{\varphi
B}, Q_{\varphi W}, Q_{\varphi WB}$, and at one-loop level from the dipole operators $Q_{uB},Q_{uW}$.
Our calculation shows also that, for operators that appear at tree level in SMEFT, one-loop corrections
can modify their contributions by less than 10%. Wilson coefficients corresponding to these five
operators are bounded from current LHC $h\to \gamma\gamma$ data -- in some cases an order of magnitude
stronger than from other searches. With mild assumptions, we point out a set of possibilities for
a field theory content at higher energies which may generate sizeable corrections in $h\to \gamma\gamma$
amplitude. Finally, we correct results that appeared previously in the literature.
