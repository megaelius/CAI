We propose a novel method to search for axion-like particles (ALPs) at particle accelerator experiments
(exps). ALPs produced at the target via the Primakoff effect subsequently enter a region with a magnetic
field, where they are converted to photons that are then detected. Dubbed Particle Accelerator
helioScopes for Slim Axion-like-particle deTection (PASSAT), our proposal uses the principle
of the axion helioscope but replaces ALPs produced in Sun with those produced in a target material.
Since we rely on ALP-photon conversions, our proposal probes light (slim) ALPs that are otherwise
inaccessible to lab-based exps which rely on ALP decay, and complements astrophysical probes that
are more model-dependent. We first reinterpret existing data from the NOMAD exp in light of PASSAT,
and constrain the parameter space for ALPs lighter than ~100 eV and ALP-photon coupling larger than
~$10^{-4}$ GeV$^{-1}$. As benchmarks of feasible low-cost exps improving over the NOMAD limits,
we study the possibility of reusing the magnets of the CAST and the proposed BabyIAXO exps and placing
them at the proposed BDF facility at CERN, along with some new detectors. We find that these realizations
of PASSAT allow for a direct probe of the parameter space for ALPs lighter than ~100 eV and ALP-photon
coupling larger than ~4 x $10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-1}$, which are regions that have not been probed yet by
exps with lab-produced ALPs. In contrast to other proposals aiming at detecting 1 or 2-photon only
events in hadronic beam dump environments, that rely heavily on Monte Carlo simulations, the background
(BG) in our proposal can be directly measured in-situ, its suppression optimized, and the irreducible
BG statistically subtracted. Sensitivity studies with other beams will be the subject of future
work. The measurements suggested here represent an additional physics case for the BDF beyond those
already proposed.
