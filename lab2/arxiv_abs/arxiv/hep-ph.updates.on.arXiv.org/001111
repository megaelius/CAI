The recent discovery of double charm baryon states by the LHCb Collaborarion and their high precision
mass determination calls for a comprehensive analysis of the nonleptonic decays of double and single
heavy baryons. Nonleptonic baryon decays play an important role in particle phenomenology since
they allow to study the interplay of long and short distance dynamics of the Standard Model (SM).
Further, they allow one to search for New Physics effects beyond the SM. We review recent progress
in experimental and theoretical studies of the nonleptonic decays of heavy baryons with a focus
on double charm baryon states and their decays. In particular, we discuss new ideas proposed by the
present authors to calculate the $W$-exchange matrix elements of the nonleptonic decays of double
heavy baryons. An important ingredient in our approach is the compositeness condition of Salam
and Weinberg, and an effective implementation of infrared confinement both of which allow one to
describe the nonperturbative structure of baryons composed of light and heavy quarks. Further
we discuss an ab initio calculational method for the treatment of the so-called $W$-exchange diagrams
generated by $W^{\pm}$ boson exchange between quarks. We found that the $W^{\pm}$-exchange contributions
are not suppressed in comparison with the tree-level (factrorizing) diagrams and must be taken
into account in the evaluation of matrix elements. Moreover, there are decay processes such as the
doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $\Xi_c^+ \to p \phi$ recently observed by the LHCb Collaboration
which is contributed to only by one single $W$-exchange diagram.
