Recent data released by the AMS experiment on the primary spectra and secondary-to-primary ratios
in cosmic rays (CRs) can pose tight constraints to astrophysical models of CR acceleration and transport
in the Galaxy, thereby providing a robust baseline of the astrophysical background for dark matter
search via antimatter. However, models of CR propagation are affected by other important sources
of uncertainties, notably from solar modulation and nuclear fragmentation, that cannot be improved
with the sole use of the AMS data. The present work is aimed at assessing these uncertainties and their
relevance in the interpretation of the new AMS data on the boron-to-carbon (B/C) ratio. Uncertainties
from solar modulation are estimated using improved models of CR transport in the Heliosphere constrained
against various type of measurements: monthly-resolved CR data collected by balloon-born or space
missions, interstellar flux data from the Voyager-1 spacecraft, and counting rates from ground-based
neutron monitor detectors. Uncertainties from nuclear fragmentation are estimated using semiempirical
cross-section formulae constrained by measurements on isotopically-resolved and charge-changing
reactions. We found that a proper data-driven treatment of solar modulation can guarantee the desired
level of precision, in comparison with the improved accuracy of the recent data on the B/C ratio.
On the other hand, nuclear uncertainties represent a serious limiting factor over a wide energy
range. We therefore stress the need for establishing a dedicated program of cross-section measurements
at the O(100 GeV) energy scale.
