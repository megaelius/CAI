We present a systematic study on minimally perturbed neutrino mass matrices which at the leading
order give rise to Tri-BiMaximal (TBM) mixing due to a residual $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mu\tau}$
Klein symmetry in the neutrino mass term of the low energy effective seesaw Lagrangian. Considering
only the breaking of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mu\tau}$ with two relevant breaking parameters ($\epsilon_{4,6}^\prime$),
after a comprehensive numerical analysis, we show that the phenomenologically viable case in this
scenario is a special case of TM1 mixing. For this class of models, from the phenomenological perspective,
one always needs large breaking (more than $ 45\%$) in one of the breaking parameters. However, to
be consistent the maximal mixing of $\theta_{23}$, while more than $ 35\%$ breaking is needed in
the other, a range $49.4^\circ-53^\circ$ and $38^\circ-40^\circ$ could be probed allowing breaking
up to $ 25\%$ in the same parameter. Thus though this model cannot distinguish the octant of $\theta_{23}$,
non-maximal mixing is preferred from the viewpoint of small breaking. The model is also interesting
from leptogenesis perspective. Unlike the standard $N_1$-leptogenesis scenario, here all the
RH neutrinos contribute to lepton asymmetry due to the small mass splitting controlled by the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mu\tau}$
breaking parameters. Inclusion of flavour coupling effects (In general, which have been partially
included in all the leptogenesis studies in perturbed TBM framework) makes our analysis and results
pertaining to a successful leptogenesis more accurate than any other studies in existing literature.
Finally, in the context of recent discovery of the ultra high energy (UHE) neutrino events at IceCube,
assuming UHE neutrinos originate from purely astrophysical sources, we obtain prediction on the
neutrino flux ratios at neutrino telescopes.
