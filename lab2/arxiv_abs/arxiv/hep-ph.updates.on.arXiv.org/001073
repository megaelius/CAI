A phenomenological constituent quark model which has been successfully applied to the study of
spectrum and electromagnetic, strong and weak decays and reactions of heavy quarkonia is used herein
to compute ground- and excited-state energies of all the $QQQ$ baryons containing either $c$- or
$b$-quarks. There is no experimental information of this kind of baryons and we believe that our
potential model prediction could help experimentalists to their quest of finding them since it
is expected that quark models describe triply-heavy baryons to a similar degree of accuracy as the
charmonium and bottomonium sectors. The three-body bound-state problem is solved by means of the
Gau\ss ian expansion method which provides enough accuracy and simplifies the subsequent evaluation
of the matrix elements. We predict several low-lying states with quantum numbers $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{\pm}$,
$\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$, $\frac{5}{2}^{\pm}$ and $\frac{7}{2}^+$. There are lattice QCD results
for the low-energy spectrum of $\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons and our calculation
agrees nicely with them for the ground state masses. However, some discrepancies are found between
our computation of excited states and the recent one reported by lattice-regularized QCD. Only
the ground states with quantum numbers $\frac{1}{2}^+$ and $\frac{3}{2}^+$ for both $\Omega_{ccb}$
and $\Omega_{cbb}$ sectors have been recently computed by lattice QCD. Therefore, we compare our
spectrum with other theoretical formalisms; in fact, this is done for all the $QQQ$ baryons containing
either $c$- or $b$-quarks. There is a general trend of agreement between the different theoretical
approaches about what would be the lowest state in each sector and with what mass. For the excited
states, the predictions are scarce and scattered but, in general, our results compare reasonably
well when data exist.
