Dark photons (DP) are interesting as potential mediators between the dark matter (DM) sector and
the fields of the Standard Model (SM). The interaction of the DP, described by a broken $U(1)_D$ gauge
symmetry, with the SM is usually generated at the one-loop level via kinetic mixing through the existence
of portal matter (PM), here assumed to be fermionic, which carries both a dark charge as well as a SM
$U(1)_Y$ hypercharge. For theoretical consistency, as well as for many phenomenological reasons,
this PM must be vector-like with respect to the SM and dark gauge groups and, in particular, is shown
to be allowed only to transform as vector-like copies of the usual SM fields. The dark Higgs that is
responsible for the breaking of $U(1)_D$ can then generate a mixing between the PM and SM fields with
the same electric charge thus altering the DP interactions with (at least some of) the SM fields and
also providing a path for the PM fields to decay. In this paper we briefly explore the phenomenology
of some specific simple models of this PM including, for the case where the PM is leptonic in nature,
their potential impact on experiments probing low energy parity-violation and the g-2 of the muon.
In the case of color-triplet, bottom quark-like PM, their direct pair- and single-production at
the LHC is shown to be observable in final states that include missing $E_T$ and/or very highly boosted
lepton-jets together with pairs of high $p_T$ b-jets that can be used to trigger on such events. These
signatures are quite distinct from those usually employed in the search for vector-like quarks
at the LHC and, furthermore, we demonstrate that the conventional signal channels for vector-like
quarks involving the SM Higgs and gauge fields are essentially closed in the case of PM.
