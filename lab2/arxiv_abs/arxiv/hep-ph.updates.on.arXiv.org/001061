In the Second Order Theories (SOT) of real relativistic fluids, the non-ideal properties are described
by a new set of dynamical tensor variables. In this work we explore the non-linear dynamics of those
modes in a conformal fluid. Among all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the Divergence Type Theories
(DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied non-perturbatively.
In considering a perturbative scheme within this formalism, at next to leading order a set of Maxwell-Cattaneo
equations is obtained, as in e.g. Israel-Stewart theories. The tensor modes include two divergence-free
modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant Navier-Stokes equations, and that are
particularly relevant because they may couple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the dynamics
of this irreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories such as DTTs, thermal fluctuations
induce a stochastic stirring force in the equations of motion, which excites the tensor modes while
preserving energy momentum conservation. From fluctuation-dissipation considerations, it
follows that the random force is Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in
turn excite vector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing a consistent non-linear,
second order description of the divergence-free tensor dynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose
(MSR) formalism we obtain the two-point correlation function for these tensor modes at next to leading
order, and the induced stochastic component of the energy-momentum tensor. We find that the thermal
fluctuations induce a scale invariant spectrum at short scales, while preserving a white spectrum
at large scales. This result suggests that tensor modes could sustain an entropy cascade.
