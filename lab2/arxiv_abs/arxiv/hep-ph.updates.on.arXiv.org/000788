A new, strongly-coupled dark sector could be accessible to LHC searches now. These dark sectors
consist of composites formed from constituents that are charged under the electroweak group and
interact with the Higgs, but are neutral under Standard Model color. In these scenarios, the most
promising target is the dark meson sector, consisting of dark vector-mesons as well as dark pions.
In this paper we study dark meson production and decay at the LHC in theories that preserve a global
SU(2) dark flavor symmetry. Dark pions can be pair-produced through resonant dark vector meson
production, $p p\to\rho_D\to\pi_D\pi_D$, and decay in one of two distinct ways: gaugephobic,
when $\pi_D\to f\bar{f}'$ generally dominates; or gaugephilic, when $\pi_D\to W+h,Z+h$ dominates
once kinematically open. Unlike QCD, the decay $\pi^0_D\to\gamma\gamma$ is virtually absent
due to the dark flavor symmetry. We recast a vast set of LHC searches to determine the current constraints
on dark meson production and decay. When $m_{\rho_D}$ is slightly heavier than $2 m_{\pi_D}$ and
$\rho_D^{\pm,0}$ kinetically mixes with the weak gauge bosons, the 8 TeV same-sign lepton search
strategy sets the best bound, $m_{\pi_D}>500$ GeV. Yet, when only the $\rho^0_D$ kinetically mixes
with hypercharge, we find the strongest LHC bound is $m_{\pi_D}>130$ GeV, that is only slightly
better than what LEP II achieved. We find the relative insensitivity of LHC searches, especially
at 13 TeV, can be blamed mainly on their penchant for high mass objects or large MET. Dedicated searches
would undoubtedly yield substantially improved sensitivity. We provide a GitHub page to speed
the implementation of these searches in future LHC analyses. Our findings provide a strong motivation
for model-independent searches of the form $pp\to A\to B+C\to SM\, SM+SM\, SM$ where the theoretical
prejudice is for SM to be a t,b,$\tau$ or W,Z,h.
