(Abridged) In order to decode the neutrino burst signal from a Galactic core-collapse supernova
and reveal the complicated inner workings of the explosion we need a thorough understanding of the
neutrino flavor evolution from the proto-neutron star outwards. The flavor content of the signal
evolves due to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a highly interesting
interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper we investigate the supernova neutrino
flavor evolution in three different progenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution
of the Mikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage through the
star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium supernova we find that the impact
of turbulence is both brief and slight during a window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral
features of collective and shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost
turbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive progenitors we again
find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to a minimal modification of the signal, and
the emerging neutrino spectra retain both collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts
of turbulence is added, 30% and 50%, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the high
density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times. Yet at the same time we find
the other mixing channels - the low density resonance channel and the non-resonant channels - begin
to develop turbulence signatures. Large amplitude turbulent motions in the outer layers of more
massive, iron core-collapse supernovae may obscure the most obvious fingerprints of collective
and shock wave effects in the neutrino signal but cannot remove them completely, and additionally
bring about new features in the signal.
