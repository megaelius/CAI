The LIGO and Virgo Interferometers have so far provided 11 gravitational-wave (GW) observations
of black-hole binaries. Similar detections are bound to become very frequent in the near future.
With the current and upcoming wealth of data, it is possible to confront specific formation models
with observations. We investigate here whether current data are compatible with the hypothesis
that LIGO/Virgo black holes are of primordial origin. We compute in detail the mass and spin distributions
of primordial black holes (PBHs), their merger rates, the stochastic background of unresolved
coalescences, and confront them with current data from the first two observational runs, also including
the recently discovered GW190412. We compute the best-fit values for the parameters of the PBH mass
distribution at formation that are compatible with current GW data. In all cases, the maximum fraction
of PBHs in dark matter is constrained by these observations to be $f_{\text{PBH}}\approx {\rm few}\times
10^{-3}$. We discuss the predictions of the PBH scenario that can be directly tested as new data become
available. In the most likely formation scenarios where PBHs are born with negligible spin, the
fact that at least one of the components of GW190412 is moderately spinning is incompatible with
a primordial origin for this event, unless accretion or hierarchical mergers are significant.
In the absence of accretion, current non-GW constraints already exclude that LIGO/Virgo events
are all of primordial origin, whereas in the presence of accretion the GW bounds on the PBH abundance
are the most stringent ones in the relevant mass range. A strong phase of accretion during the cosmic
history would favour mass ratios close to unity, and a redshift-dependent correlation between
high masses, high spins and nearly-equal mass binaries, with the secondary component spinning
faster than the primary.
