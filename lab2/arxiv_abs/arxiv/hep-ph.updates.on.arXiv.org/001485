Second order beta-decay processes with and without neutrinos in the final state are key probes of
nuclear physics and of the nature of neutrinos. Neutrinoful double-beta decay is the rarest Standard
Model process that has been observed and provides a unique test of the understanding of weak nuclear
interactions. Observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would reveal that neutrinos are
Majorana fermions and that lepton number conservation is violated in nature. While significant
progress has been made in phenomenological approaches to understanding these processes, establishing
a connection between these processes and the physics of the Standard Model and beyond is a critical
task as it will provide input into the design and interpretation of future experiments. The strong-interaction
contributions to double-beta decay processes are non-perturbative and can only be addressed systematically
through a combination of lattice Quantum Chromoodynamics (LQCD) and nuclear many-body calculations.
In this review, current efforts to establish the LQCD connection are discussed for both neutrinoful
and neutrinoless double-beta decay. LQCD calculations of the hadronic contributions to the neutrinoful
process $nn\to pp e^- e^- \bar\nu_e\bar\nu_e$ and to various neutrinoless pionic transitions
are reviewed, and the connections of these calculations to the phenomenology of double-beta decay
through the use of effective field theory (EFTs) is highlighted. At present, LQCD calculations
are limited to small nuclear systems, and to pionic subsystems, and require matching to appropriate
EFTs to have direct phenomenological impact. However, these calculations have already revealed
qualitatively that there are terms in the EFTs that can only be constrained from double-beta decay
processes themselves or using inputs from LQCD. Future prospects for direct calculations in larger
nuclei are also discussed.
