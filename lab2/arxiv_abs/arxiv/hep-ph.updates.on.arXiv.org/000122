We report a global fit of parameters for fermion masses and mixing, including light sterile neutrinos,
within a local vector $SU(3)$ family symmetry model. In this scenario, ordinary heavy fermions,
top and bottom quarks and tau lepton, become massive at tree level from {\bf Dirac See-saw} mechanisms
implemented by the introduction of a new set of $SU(2)_L$ weak singlet vector-like fermions, $U,D,E,N$,
with $N$ a sterile neutrino. The $N_{L,R}$ sterile neutrinos allow the implementation of a $8\times
8$ general tree level See-saw Majorana neutrino mass matrix with four massless eigenvalues. Hence,
light fermions, including light neutrinos obtain masses from one loop radiative corrections mediated
by the massive $SU(3)$ gauge bosons. This BSM model is able to accommodate the known spectrum of quark
masses and mixing in a $4\times 4$ non-unitary $V_{CKM}$ as well as the charged lepton masses. The
explored parameter space region provide the vector-like fermion masses: $M_D \approx 914.365
$GeV, $M_U \approx 1.5 $TeV, $M_E \approx 5.97 $TeV, $SU(3)$ family gauge boson masses of $\mathcal{O}
(1-10) $TeV, the neutrino masses $(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, m_6, m_7, m_8)= (0,0.0085, 0.049, 0.22,
3.21 , 1749.96,1\times 10^8, 1\times 10^9 ) $eV, with the squared neutrino mass differences: $m_2^2-m_1^2
\approx 7.23 \times 10^{-5} \text{eV}^2$, $m_3^2-m_1^2 \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-3} \text{eV}^2$,
$m_4^2-m_1^2 \approx 0.049 \text{eV}^2$, $m_5^2-m_1^2 \approx 10.3 \text{eV}^2$. We also show
the corresponding $U_{PMNS}$ lepton mixing matrix. However, the neutrino mixing angles are extremely
sensitive to parameter space region, and an improved and detailed analysis is in progress.
