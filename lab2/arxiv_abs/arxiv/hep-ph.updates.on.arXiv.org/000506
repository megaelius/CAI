Given the high luminosities at which CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operates, multiple proton-proton
collisions occur during the same bunch crossing. Hard collisions are therefore contaminated by
several soft, zero-bias, ones. This effect, known as pileup pollutes the reconstruction of the
final state of the collision. This document is meant to provide a theoretical review of the methods
employed during Run I of the LHC and at the beginning of Run II to mitigate pileup effects. I will start
with a in-depth presentation of the area-median used for the vast majority of applications, including
several refinements of the original idea, their practical (numerical) implementation and an assessment
of their efficiency and robustness. I will then focus on several theoretical calculations that
can provide both quantitative and qualitative information on the area-median approach. In the
specific case of boosted jets, a field that has seen a wide interest recently, a set of methods, known
as grooming techniques has also been used. I will describe these techniques, address their performance
and briefly show that they are amenable to a theoretical, analytic, understanding. The last part
of this review will focus on ideas oriented towards future pileup mitigation techniques. This includes
a couple of new methods that have recently been proposed as well as a large series of alternative methods.
The latter are yet unpublished and have not received the same amount of investigation than the former
but they have the potential to bring new developments and further improvement over existing techniques
in a future where pileup mitigation will be crucial.
