Axions/axion-like particles (ALPs) are a well motivated extension of the Standard Model and are
generic within String Theory. The X-ray transparency of the intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy
clusters is a powerful probe of light ALPs (with mass $<10^{-11}\,{\rm eV}$); as X-ray photons from
an embedded or background source propagate through the magnetized ICM, they may undergo energy-dependent
quantum mechanical conversion into ALPs (and vice versa), imprinting distortions on the X-ray
spectrum. We present Chandra data for the active galactic nucleus NGC1275 at the center of the Perseus
cluster. Employing a 490ks High-Energy Transmission Gratings (HETG) exposure, we obtain a high-quality
1-9keV spectrum free from photon pileup and ICM contamination. Apart from iron-band features,
the spectrum is described by a power-law continuum, with any spectral distortions at the $<3\%$
level. We compute photon survival probabilities as a function of ALP mass $m_a$ and ALP-photon coupling
constant $g_{a\gamma}$ for an ensemble of ICM magnetic field models, and then use the NGC1275 spectrum
to constraint the $(m_a, g_{a\gamma})$-plane. Marginalizing over magnetic field realizations,
the 99.7% credible region limits the ALP-photon coupling to $g_{a\gamma}<6-8\times 10^{-13}\,
{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ (depending upon magnetic field model) for masses $m_a<1\times 10^{-12}\,{\rm
eV}$. These are the most stringent limit to date on $g_{a\gamma}$ for these light ALPs, and have already
reached the sensitivity limits of next-generation helioscopes and light-shining-through-wall
experiments. We highlight the potential of these studies with the next-generation X-ray observatories
Athena and Lynx, but note the critical importance of advances in relative calibration of these future
X-ray spectrometers.
