Recent string theory tests of swampland ideas like the distance or the dS conjectures have been performed
at weak coupling. Testing these ideas beyond the weak coupling regime remains challenging. We propose
to exploit the modular symmetries of the moduli effective action to check swampland constraints
beyond perturbation theory. As an example we study the case of heterotic 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ compactifications,
whose non-perturbative effective action is known to be invariant under modular symmetries acting
on the K\"ahler and complex structure moduli, in particular $SL(2,Z)$ T-dualities (or subgroups
thereof) for 4d heterotic or orbifold compactifications. Remarkably, in models with non-perturbative
superpotentials, the corresponding duality invariant potentials diverge at points at infinite
distance in moduli space. The divergence relates to towers of states becoming light, in agreement
with the distance conjecture. We discuss specific examples of this behavior based on gaugino condensation
in heterotic orbifolds. We show that these examples are dual to compactifications of type I' or Horava-Witten
theory, in which the $SL(2,Z)$ acts on the complex structure of an underlying 2-torus, and the tower
of light states correspond to D0-branes or M-theory KK modes. The non-perturbative examples explored
point to potentials not leading to weak coupling at infinite distance, but rather diverging in the
asymptotic corners of moduli space, dynamically forbidding the access to points with global symmetries.
We perform a study of general modular invariant potentials and find that there are dS maxima and saddle
points but no dS minima, and that all examples explored obey the refined dS conjecture.
