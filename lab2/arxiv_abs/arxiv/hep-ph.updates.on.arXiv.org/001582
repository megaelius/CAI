We investigate the semi-leptonic decays of $\bar B \to D^{(*)} \ell\bar\nu$ in terms of the Heavy-Quark-Effective-Theory
(HQET) parameterization for the form factors, which is described with the heavy quark expansion
up to $\mathcal O(1/m_c^2)$ beyond the simple approximation considered in the original CLN parameterization.
An analysis with this setup was first given in the literature, and then we extend it to the comprehensive
analyses including (i) simultaneous fit of $|V_{cb}|$ and the HQET parameters to available experimental
full distribution data and theory constraints, and (ii) New Physics (NP) contributions of the $V_2$
and $T$ types to the decay distributions and rates. For this purpose, we perform Bayesian fit analyses
by using Stan program, a state-of-the-art public platform for statistical computation. Then,
we show that our $|V_{cb}|$ fit results for the SM scenarios are close to the PDG combined average
from the exclusive mode, and indicate significance of the angular distribution data. In turn, for
the $\text{SM} + \text{NP}$ scenarios, our fit analyses find that non-zero NP contribution is favored
at the best fit point for both $\text{SM} + V_2$ and $\text{SM} + T$ depending on the HQET parameterization
model. A key feature is then realized in the $\bar B \to D^{(*)} \tau\bar\nu$ observables. Our fit
result of the HQET parameters in the $\text{SM} (+T)$ produces a consistent value for $R_D$ while
smaller for $R_{D^*}$, compared with the previous SM prediction in the HFLAV report. On the other
hand, $\text{SM}+V_2$ points to smaller and larger values for $R_D$ and $R_{D^*}$ than the SM predictions.
In particular, the $R_{D^*}$ deviation from the experimental measurement becomes smaller, which
could be interesting for future improvement on measurements at the Belle II experiment.
