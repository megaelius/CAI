By simulating the finite temperatures magnetized background in the RHIC and LHC energies, we systematically
study the characteristics of thermal widths and potentials of heavy quarkonia. It is found that
the magnetic field has less influence on the real potential, but has a significant influence on the
imaginary potential, especially in the low deconfined temperature. Extracted from the effect
of thermal worldsheet fluctuations about the classical configuration, the thermal width of $\Upsilon(1s)$
in the finite temperature magnetized background is investigated. It is found that at the low deconfined
temperature the magnetic field can generate a significant thermal fluctuation of the thermal width
of $\Upsilon(1s)$, but with the increase of temperature, the effect of magnetic field on the thermal
width becomes less important, which means the effect of high temperature completely exceeds that
of magnetic field and magnetic field become less important at high temperature. The thermal width
decreases with the increasing rapidity at the finite temperature magnetized background. It is
also observed that the effect of the magnetic field on the thermal width when dipole moving parallel
to the magnetic field direction are larger than that moving perpendicular to the magnetic field
direction, which implies that the magnetic field tends to enhance thermal fluctuation when dipole
moving parallel to the direction of magnetic field. The thermal width of $\Upsilon(1S)$ hardly
changes with the increasing temperature when dipole moving perpendicular to the magnetic field.
But when dipole moving parallel to the magnetic field, the thermal width at low temperature is obviously
larger than that at high temperature.
