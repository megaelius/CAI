The large branching ratios for pure annihilation $\bar{B}_s^0$ $\to$ $\pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\bar{B}_d^0$
$\to$ $K^+ K^-$ decays reported by CDF and LHCb collaborations recently and the so-called ${\pi}K$
and ${\pi}{\pi}$ puzzles indicate that spectator scattering and annihilation contributions
are important to the penguin-dominated, color-suppressed tree dominated, and pure annihilation
nonleptonic $B$ decays. Combining the available experimental data for $B_{u,d}$ ${\to}$ $\pi
\pi$, ${\pi}K$ and $K \bar{K}$ decays, we do a global fit on the spectator scattering and annihilation
parameters $X_H({\rho}_H$, ${\phi}_H)$, $X_A^i({\rho}_A^{i},{\phi}_A^{i})$ and $X_A^f({\rho}_A^{f},{\phi}_A^{f})$,
which are used to parameterize the endpoint singularity in amplitudes of spectator scattering,
nonfactorizable and factorizable annihilation topologies within the QCD factorization framework,
in three scenarios for different purpose. Numerically, in scenario II, we get $({\rho}_A^{i},{\phi}_A^{i}[^{\circ}])=(2.88^{+1.52}_{-1.30},-103^{+33}_{-40})$
and $({\rho}_A^{f},{\phi}_A^{f}[^{\circ}])=(1.21^{+0.22}_{-0.25},-40^{+12}_{-8})$ at
the $68\%$ confidence level, which are mainly demanded by resolving ${\pi}K$ puzzle and confirm
the presupposition that $X_A^i\neq X_A^f$. In addition, correspondingly, the $B$-meson wave
function parameter $\lambda_B$ is also fitted to be $0.18^{+0.11}_{-0.08}\, MeV$, which plays
an important role for resolving both ${\pi}K$ and $\pi\pi$ puzzles. With the fitted parameters,
the QCDF results for observables of $B_{u,d}$ $\to$ $\pi \pi$, $\pi K$ and $K \bar{K}$ decays are
in good agreement with experimental measurements. Much more experimental and theoretical efforts
are expected to understand the underlying QCD dynamics of spectator scattering and annihilation
contributions.
