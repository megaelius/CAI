Superheavy threshold corrections to the matching condition between matter Yukawa couplings of
the effective Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and the New Minimal Supersymmetric
(SO(10)) GUT(NMSGUT) provide a novel and generic mechanism for reducing the long standing and generically
problematic operator dimension 5 Baryon decay rates. In suitable regions of the parameter space
strong wave function renormalization of the effective MSSM Higgs doublets due to the large number
of heavy fields can take the wave function renormalization of the MSSM Higgs field close to the dissolution
value ($Z_{H,\overline{H}}=0$). Rescaling to canonical kinetic terms lowers the SO(10) Yukawas
required to match the MSSM fermion data. Since the same Yukawas determine the dimension 5 B violation
operator coefficients, the associated rates can be suppressed to levels compatible with current
limits. Including these threshold effects also relaxes the constraint $ y_b-y_\tau\simeq y_s-y_\mu$
operative between $\textbf{10} -\textbf{120} $ plet generated tree level MSSM matter fermion
Yukawas $y_f$. We exhibit accurate fits of the MSSM fermion mass-mixing data in terms of NMSGUT superpotential
couplings and 5 independent soft Susy breaking parameters specified at $10^{16.25}\,$ GeV with
the claimed suppression of Baryon decay rates. As before, our s-spectra are of the mini split supersymmetry
type with large $|A_0|,\mu,m_{H,\overline H} > 100\,\,$ TeV, light gauginos and normal s-hierarchy.
Large $A_0,\mu$ and soft masses allow significant deviation from the canonical GUT gaugino mass
ratios and ensure vacuum safety. Even without optimization, prominent candidates for BSM discovery
such as the muon magnetic anomaly, $b\rightarrow s\gamma$ and Lepto-genesis CP violation emerge
in the preferred ball park.
