We propose a systematic theoretical framework for the topological amplitudes of the heavy meson
decays and their $SU(N)$ decomposition. In the framework, the topological amplitudes are expressed
in invariant tensors and classified into tree- and penguin-operator-induced diagrams according
to which four-quark operators, tree or penguin, being inserted into their effective weak vertexes.
By decomposing the four-quark operators into irreducible representations of $SU(N)$ group, one
can derive the $SU(N)$ irreducible amplitudes from the tensor form of the topology. Taking the $D\to
PP$ decay ($P$ denoting a pseudoscalar meson) with $SU(3)_F$ symmetry as an example, we show our
framework in detail. The fact that some topologies are not independent in the $SU(3)_F$ limit is
explained by group theory. It is found that there are only nine independent topologies in all tree-
and penguin-operator-induced diagrams contributing to the $D\to PP$ decays in the Standard Model.
If a large quark-loop diagram is assumed, the large $\Delta A_{CP}$ and the very different $D^0\to
K^+K^-$ and $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$ branching fractions can be explained with a normal $U$-spin breaking.
Moreover, our framework provides a simple and systematic way to analyze the $SU(N)$ breaking effects.
As examples, the linear $SU(3)_F$ breaking and the high order $U$-spin breaking in charm decays
are re-investigated in our framework, which are consistent with literature. We propose the concepts
of splitting and degeneracy of topologies, and use them to describe the charm-less bottom decay.
We find $SU(3)_F$ analysis for the charm-less $B$ decays is different from the $D$ decays because
the charm-quark loop is beyond the $SU(3)$ symmetry and should be investigated in the symmetry breaking
chain of $SU(4)\to SU(3)$.
