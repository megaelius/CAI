The one loop self energy of the neutral rho meson is obtained for the effective $\rho\pi\pi$ and $\rho
NN$ interaction at finite temperature and density in presence of a constant background magnetic
field of arbitrary strength. In our approach, the eB-dependent vacuum part of the self energy is
extracted by means of dimensional regularization where the ultraviolet divergences corresponding
to the pure vacuum self energy manifest as the pole singularities of gamma as well as Hurwitz zeta
functions. This improved regularization procedure consistently reproduces the expected results
in the vanishing magnetic field limit and can be used quite generally in other self energy calculations
dealing with arbitrary magnetic field strength. In presence of the external magnetic field, the
general Lorentz structure for the in-medium vector boson self energy is derived which can also be
implemented in case of the gauge osons such as photons and gluons. It has been shown that with vanishing
perpendicular momentum of the external particle, essentially two form factors are sufficient
to describe the self energy completely. Consequently, two distinct modes are observed in the study
of the effective mass, dispersion relations and the spectral function of $\rho^0$ where one of the
modes possesses two fold degeneracy. For large baryonic chemical potential, it is observed that
the critical magnetic field required to block the $\rho^0\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-$ decay channel
increases significantly with temperature. However, in case of smaller values reaching down to
vanishing chemical potential, the critical field follows the opposite trend. The requirement
of smaller critical field makes the stability of $\rho^0$ against the $\pi^+\pi^-$ decay more likely
to be observed in heavy-ion collision experiments in LHC.
