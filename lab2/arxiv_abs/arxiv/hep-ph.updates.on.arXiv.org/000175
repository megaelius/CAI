The description of the VV'P form factors (V,V' stands for vector particles and P for a pseudoscalar
meson) for different particles virtualities remains a challenge for the theory of strong interactions.
While their chiral limit is well understood, recent measurements of the gamma^* omega pi^0 and gamma^*
gamma pi^0 form factors at high photon virtualities seem to depart from the simplest scaling behavior
suggested by QCD. Here we attempt to describe them in their whole measured energy regimes within
the Resonance Chiral Theory, a framework which naturally incorporates the chiral limit constraints
and extends to higher energies by including the resonances as active fields. Specifically, we obtained
an accurate description of the data up to 2 GeV on the former form factor by including three multiplets
of vector resonances. Good agreement with measurements of the latter was possible even in the single
resonance approximation, although we propose to measure the e^+e^- to mu^+mu^-pi^0 cross-section
and di-muon invariant mass distribution to better characterize this form factor. We have then evaluated
the pion exchange contribution to the muon g-2 obtaining (6.66\pm0.21)x10^{-10} with an accurate
determination of the errors. We have also recalled that approximating the whole pion exchange by
the pion pole contribution underestimates the corresponding result for the anomaly (by (15,20)%).
Based on these results, we have predicted the eta^(\prime) transition form factors obtaining good
agreement with data and obtained their respective contributions to the muon anomaly. In this way,
the contribution of the three lightest pseudoscalars to it yields (10.47\pm0.54)x10^{-10}, in
agreement with previous evaluations but with smaller error.
