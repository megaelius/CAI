This work studies collinearly factorizable nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) in
perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at next-to-leading order in the light of hadron-nucleus
collision data which have not been included in nPDF analyses previously. The aim is at setting new
constraints on the nuclear modifications of the gluon distribution and on the flavour separation
of quark nuclear modifications. The introductory part provides an outline of the theoretical framework
of QCD collinear factorization and the used statistical methods and relates the work presented
here to other similar contemporary analyses. As a result, a new set of nPDFs, EPPS16, is presented,
including for the first time electroweak-boson and dijet production data from CERN-LHC proton-lead
collisions and allowing a full flavour separation in the fit. The flavour separation is constrained
with Drell-Yan dilepton-production data from fixed target pion-nucleus experiments and neutrino-nucleus
deep-inelastic scattering data, which are shown to give evidence for the similarity of the u and
d valence-quark nuclear modifications. For studying the gluon degrees of freedom, collider data
are essential and in the EPPS16 analysis new constraints are derived from the dijet production at
the LHC. Possible further constraints for the gluons are investigated in terms of the LHC data on
nuclear modification ratios of dijet and D-meson production. Using a non-quadratically improved
Hessian reweighting method, these measurements are found to put stringent constraints on the gluon
modifications in the lead nucleus, reaching smaller values of the nucleon momentum fraction than
previously accessible. A study on the future prospects of constraining nPDFs within a multi-observable
approach with the BNL-RHIC is also given.
