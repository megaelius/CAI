Irrespective of the dark matter (DM) candidate, several potentially observable signatures derive
from the velocity distribution of DM in halos, in particular in the Milky Way (MW) halo. Examples
include direct searches for weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), $p$-wave suppressed
or Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation signals, microlensing events of primordial black holes
(PBHs), {\em etc}. Most current predictions are based on the Maxwellian approximation which is
not only theoretically inconsistent in bounded systems, but also not supported by cosmological
simulations. A more consistent method sometimes used in calculations for direct WIMP searches
relies on the so-called Eddington inversion method, which relates the DM phase-space distribution
function (DF) to its mass density profile and the total gravitational potential of the system. Originally
built upon the isotropy assumption, this method can be extended to anisotropic systems. We investigate
these inversion methods in the context of Galactic DM searches, motivated by the fact that the MW
is a strongly constrained system, and should be even more so with the ongoing Gaia survey. We still
draw conclusions that apply to the general case. In particular, we illustrate how neglecting the
radial boundary of the DM halo leads to theoretical inconsistencies. We also show that several realistic
configurations of the DM halo and the MW baryonic content entail ill-defined DFs, significantly
restricting the configuration space over which these inversion methods can apply. We propose consistent
solutions to these issues. Finally, we compute several observables inferred from constrained
Galactic mass models relevant to DM searches (WIMPs or PBHs), {\em e.g.} moments and inverse moments
of the DM speed and relative speed distributions.
