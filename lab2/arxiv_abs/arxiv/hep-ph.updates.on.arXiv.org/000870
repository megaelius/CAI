We summarize some of the results presented in arXiv:1801.07975 [nucl-th]\cite{FSIpaper}(to
be published in EPJC in 2018) on modeling electron and neutrino QE scattering on a variety of nuclei
within the impulse approximation. We find that with three parameters we can describe the final state
lepton energy for all of available electron QE data on Lithium, Carbon+Oxygen, Aluminum, Calcium+Argon,
Iron and Lead+Gold. The first parameter, the removal energy $\epsilon^{P,N}$ is extracted from
exclusive ee$^{\prime}$p spectral function data. The second parameter $V_{eff}$, which accounts
for the interaction of final state leptons and protons with the Coulomb potential of the nucleus,
is available from published comparisons of inclusive QE electron and positron cross section. We
extract the third parameter $U_{FSI}(\vec {q}_3^2)$, which accounts for the interaction of the
final state nucleon with the optical potential of the spectator nucleus (FSI), by fitting all available
inclusive QE cross sections on nuclear targets. Here $q_3$ is the three momentum transfer. With
these three parameters we can model the energy of final state electrons and nucleons for all available
electron QE scattering data. At present the uncertainty in the value of the removal energy parameters
is a the largest source of systematic error in the extraction of the neutrino oscillation parameter
$\Delta{m}^2$. The use of the updated parameters in neutrino Monte Carlo generators reduces the
systematic uncertainty in the combined removal energy (with FSI corrections) from $\pm$ 20 MeV
to $\pm$ 5 MeV. In this short contribution we only summarize the results for Carbon+Oxygen and Calcium+Argon
