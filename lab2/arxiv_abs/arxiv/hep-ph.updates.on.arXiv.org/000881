We demonstrate that a nonzero strangeness contribution to the spacelike electromagnetic form
factor of the nucleon is evidence for a strange-antistrange asymmetry in the nucleon's light-front
wave function, thus implying different nonperturbative contributions to the strange and antistrange
quark distribution functions. A recent lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon strange quark form
factor predicts that the strange quark distribution is more centralized in coordinate space than
the antistrange quark distribution, and thus the strange quark distribution is more spread out
in light-front momentum space. We show that the lattice prediction implies that the difference
between the strange and antistrange parton distribution functions, $s(x)-\bar{s}(x)$, is negative
at small-$x$ and positive at large-$x$. We also evaluate the strange quark form factor and $s(x)-\bar{s}(x)$
using a baryon-meson fluctuation model and a novel nonperturbative model based on light-front
holographic QCD. This procedure leads to a Veneziano-like expression of the form factor, which
depends exclusively on the twist of the hadron and the properties of the Regge trajectory of the vector
meson which couples to the quark current in the hadron. The holographic structure of the model allows
us to introduce unambiguously quark masses in the form factors and quark distributions preserving
the hard scattering counting rule at large-$Q^2$ and the inclusive counting rule at large-$x$.
Quark masses modify the Regge intercept which governs the small-$x$ behavior of quark distributions,
therefore modifying their small-$x$ singular behavior. Both nonperturbative approaches provide
descriptions of the strange-antistrange asymmetry and intrinsic strangeness in the nucleon consistent
with the lattice QCD result.
