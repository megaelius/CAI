We investigate possibility of emission of the bremsstrahlung photons in nuclear reactions with
hypernuclei for the first time. A new model of the bremsstrahlung emission which accompanies interactions
between $\alpha$ particles and hypernuclei is constructed, where a new formalism for the magnetic
momenta of nucleons and hyperon inside hypernucleus is added. For first calculations, we choose
$\alpha$ decay of the normal nucleus $^{210}{\rm Po}$ and the hypernucleus $^{211}_{\Lambda}{\rm
Po}$. We find that (1) emission for the hypernucleus $^{211}_{\Lambda}{\rm Po}$ is larger than
for normal nucleus $^{210}{\rm Po}$, (2) difference between these spectra is small. We propose
a way how to find hypernuclei, where role of hyperon is the most essential in emission of bremsstrahlung
photons during $\alpha$ decay. As demonstration of such a property, we show that the spectra for
the hypernuclei $^{107}_{\Lambda}{\rm Te}$ and $^{109}_{\Lambda}{\rm Te}$ are essentially
larger than the spectra for the normal nuclei $^{106}{\rm Te}$ and $^{108}{\rm Te}$. Such a difference
is explained by additional contribution of emission to the full bremsstrahlung, which is formed
by magnetic moment of hyperon inside hypernucleus. The bremsstrahlung emission formed by such
a mechanism, is of the magnetic type. A new formula for fast estimations of bremsstrahlung spectra
for even-even hypernuclei is proposed, where role of magnetic moment of hyperon of hypernucleus
in formation of the bremsstrahlung emission is shown explicitly. Such an analysis opens possibility
of new experimental study of properties of hypernuclei via bremsstrahlung study.
