The spectroscopic parameters and decay channels of the axial-vector tetraquark $T_{bb;\overline{u}\overline{s}}^{-}$
(in what follows $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$) are explored by means of the QCD sum rule
method. The mass and coupling of this state are calculated using the two-point sum rules by taking
into account various vacuum condensates up to dimension 10. Our prediction for the mass of this state
$m=(10215\pm 250)~\mathrm{MeV}$ confirms that it is stable against strong and electromagnetic
decays, and can dissociate to conventional mesons only through weak transformations. We investigate
the dominant semileptonic $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}} \to \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}l\overline{\nu}_l$
and nonleptonic $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}} \to \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}M$
decays of $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$. In these processes the $\mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}$
is a color-triplet scalar tetraquark with the quark content $bc\overline{u}\overline{s}$, whereas
$M$ is one of the vector mesons $\rho ^{-}, K^{\ast }(892), D^{\ast }(2010)^{-}$, and $D_{s}^{\ast
-}$. In order to calculate partial widths of these decays, we make use of the QCD three-point sum rule
approach and evaluate weak transition form factors $G_{i}$, $i=0.1,2,3$, which govern these processes.
The full width $\Gamma _{\mathrm{full}} =(12.9\pm 2.1)\times 10^{-8}~\mathrm{MeV}$, and mean
lifetime $\tau=5.1_{-0.71}^{+0.99}~\mathrm{fs}$ of the tetraquark $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$
are computed using aforementioned weak decays. Obtained information on parameters of $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$
and $\mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}$ is useful for experimental investigations of these
doubly-heavy exotic mesons.
