In this article, we review the HAL QCD method to investigate baryon-baryon interactions such as
nuclear forces in lattice QCD. We first explain our strategy in detail to investigate baryon-baryon
interactions by defining potentials in field theories such as QCD. We introduce the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter
(NBS) wave functions in QCD for two baryons below the inelastic threshold. We then define the potential
from NBS wave functions in terms of the derivative expansion, which is shown to reproduce the scattering
phase shifts correctly below the inelastic threshold. Using this definition, we formulate a method
to extract the potential in lattice QCD. Secondly, we discuss pros and cons of the HAL QCD method,
by comparing it with the conventional method, where one directly extracts the scattering phase
shifts from the finite volume energies through the L\"uscher's formula. We give several theoretical
and numerical evidences that the conventional method combined with the naive plateau fitting for
the finite volume energies in the literature so far fails to work on baryon-baryon interactions
due to contaminations of elastic excited states. On the other hand, we show that such a serious problem
can be avoided in the HAL QCD method by defining the potential in an energy-independent way. We also
discuss systematics of the HAL QCD method, in particular errors associated with a truncation of
the derivative expansion. Thirdly, we present several results obtained from the HAL QCD method,
which include (central) nuclear force, tensor force, spin-orbital force, and three nucleon force.
We finally show the latest results calculated at the nearly physical pion mass, $m_\pi \simeq 146$
MeV, including hyperon forces which lead to form $\Omega\Omega$ and $N\Omega$ dibaryons.
