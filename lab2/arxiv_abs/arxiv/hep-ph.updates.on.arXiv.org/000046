We present a coupled channel unitary approach to obtain states dynamically generated from the meson
baryon interaction with hidden charm, using constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry. We use as
basis of states, $\bar D B$, $\bar D^* B$ states, with $B$ baryon charmed states belonging to the 20
representations of SU(4) with $J^P=1/2^+,~3/2^+$. In addition we also include the $\eta_c N$ and
$J/\psi N$ states. The inclusion of these coupled channels is demanded by heavy quark spin symmetry,
since in the large $m_Q$ limit the $D$ and $D^*$ states are degenerate and are obtained from each other
by means of a spin rotation, under which QCD is invariant. The novelty in the work is that we use dynamics
from the extrapolation of the local hidden gauge model to SU(4) and we show that this dynamics fully
respects the constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry. With the full space of states demanded by
the heavy quark spin symmetry and the dynamics of the local hidden gauge we look for states dynamically
generated and find four basic states which are bound, corresponding to $\bar D \Sigma_c$, $\bar
D \Sigma_c^*$, $\bar D^* \Sigma_c$ and $\bar D^* \Sigma_c^*$, decaying mostly into $\eta_c N$ and
$J/\psi N$. All the states appear in isospin $I=1/2$ and we find no bound states or resonances in $I=3/2$.
The $\bar D \Sigma_c$ state appears in $J=1/2$, the $\bar D \Sigma_c^*$ in $J=3/2$, the $\bar D^*
\Sigma_c$ appears nearly degenerate in $J=1/2, ~3/2$ and the $\bar D^* \Sigma_c^*$ appears nearly
degenerate in $J=1/2, ~3/2, ~5/2$, with the peculiarity that in $J=5/2$ the state has zero width
in the space of states chosen. All the states are bound with about 50 MeV with respect to the corresponding
$\bar D B$ thresholds and the width, except for the $J=5/2$ state, is also of the same order of magnitude.
