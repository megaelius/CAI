We critically (re)examine the associated production process of a $J/\psi$ meson plus an open charm
hadron at the LHC in the proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-lead ($p{\rm Pb}$) collisions. Such a process
is very intriguing in the sense of tailoring to explore the double parton structure of nucleons and
to determine the geometry of partons in nuclei. In order to interpret the existing $pp$ data with
the LHCb detector at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, we introduce two overlooked mechanisms
for the double parton scattering (DPS) and single parton scattering (SPS) processes. Besides the
conventional DPS mode, where the two mesons are produced almost independently in the two separate
scattering subprocesses, we propose a novel DPS mechanism that the two constituent (heavy) quarks
stemming from two hard scatterings can form into a composite particle, like the $J/\psi$ meson,
during the hadronization phase. However, it turns out the corresponding contribution is small
in $J/\psi+c\bar{c}$ hadroproduction. On the contrary, we point out that the resummation of the
initial state logarithms due to gluon splitting into a charm quark pair is crucial to understand
the LHCb measurement, which was overlooked in the literature. We perform a proper matching between
the perturbative calculations in different initial-quark flavor number schemes, generically
referring to the variable flavor number scheme. The new variable flavor number scheme calculation
for the process strongly enhance the SPS cross sections, almost closing the discrepancies between
theory and experiment. Finally, we present our predictions for the forthcoming LHCb measurement
in $p{\rm Pb}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV. Some interesting observables are exploited
to set up the control regions of the DPS signal and to probe the impact-parameter dependent parton
densities in lead.
