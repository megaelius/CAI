We argue that the deep inelastic structure function $F_2^{\gamma p}(x, Q^2)$, regarded as a cross
section for virtual $\gamma^*p$ scattering, is hadronic in nature. This implies that its growth
is limited by the Froissart bound at high hadronic energies, giving a $\ln^2 (1/x)$ bound on $F_2^{\gamma
p}$ as Bjorken $x\rightarrow 0$. The same bound holds for the individual quark distributions. In
earlier work, we obtained a very accurate global fit to the combined HERA data on $F_2^{\gamma p}$
using a fit function which respects the Froissart bound at small $x$, and is equivalent in its $x$
dependence to the function used successfully to describe all high energy hadronic cross sections,
including $\gamma p$ scattering. We extrapolate that fit by a factor of $\lesssim$3 beyond the HERA
region in the natural variable $\ln(1/x)$ to the values of $x$ down to $x=10^{-14}$ and use the results
to derive the quark distributions needed for the reliable calculation of neutrino cross sections
at energies up to $E_\nu=10^{17}$ GeV. These distributions do not satisfy the Feynman "wee parton"
assumption, that they all converge toward a common distribution $xq(x,Q^2)$ at small $x$ and large
$Q^2$. This was used in some past calculations to express the dominant neutrino structure function
$F_2^{\nu(\bar{\nu})}$ directly in terms of $F_2^{\gamma p}$. We show that the correct distributions
nevertheless give results for $F_2^{\nu(\bar{\nu})}$ which differ only slightly from those obtained
assuming that the wee parton limit holds. In two Appendices, we develop simple analytic results
for the effects of QCD evolution and operator-product corrections on the distribution functions
at small $x$, and show that these effects amount mainly to shifting the values of $\ln(1/x)$ in the
initial distributions.
