Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a well motivated extension of the Standard Model and
are generic in String Theory. The X-ray transparency of the magnetized intracluster medium (ICM)
in galaxy clusters is a powerful probe of very light ALPs (masses $0<m_a<10^{-11}\,{\rm eV}$);
as X-ray photons propagate through the magnetic field of the ICM, they may undergo energy-dependent
quantum mechanical conversion into ALPs (and vice versa), imprinting distortions on the observed
X-ray spectrum. We present new Chandra data for the active galactic nucleus NGC1275 at the center
of the Perseus cluster. Employing the High-Energy Transmission Gratings (HETG) with a 490ks exposure,
we obtain a high-quality 1-9keV spectrum free from photon pileup and ICM contamination. Apart from
iron-band features, the spectrum is accurately described by a power-law continuum, with any spectral
distortions at the $<3$% level. We compute photon survival probabilities as a function of ALP mass
$m_a$ and ALP-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$ for an ensemble of ICM magnetic field models,
and then use the NGC1275 spectrum to derive constraints on the $(m_a, g_{a\gamma})$-plane. Marginalizing
over the magnetic field realizations, the 99.7% credible region limits the ALP-photon coupling
to $g_{a\gamma}<6-8\times 10^{-13}\, {\rm GeV}^{-1}$ (depending upon the magnetic field model)
for masses $m_a<1\times 10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. These are the most stringent limit to date on $g_{a\gamma}$
for these very light ALPs, and have already reached the sensitivity limits of next-generation helioscopes
and light-shining-through-wall experiments. We highlight the potential of these studies with
the next-generation X-ray observatories Athena and Lynx, but note the critical importance of advances
in relative calibration of these future X-ray spectrometers.
