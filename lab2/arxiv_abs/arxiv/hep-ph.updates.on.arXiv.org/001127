We present a systematic study for the statistical fits of the transverse momentum distributions
of charged pions, Kaons and protons produced at energies ranging between 7.7 and 2670 GeV to the extensive
Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) and the nonextensive statistics (Tsallis as a special type and the generic
axiomatic nonextensive approach). We also present a comprehensive review on various experimental
parametrizations proposed to fit the transverse momentum distributions of these produced particles.
The inconsistency that the BG approach is to be utilized in characterizing the chemical freezeout,
while the Tsallis approach in determining the kinetic freezeout is elaborated. The resulting energy
dependence of the different fit parameters largely varies with the particle species and the degree
of (non)extensivity. This manifests that the Tsallis nonextensive approach seems to work well
for p+p rather than for A+A collisions. Drawing a complete picture of the utilization of Tsallis
statistics in modeling the transverse momentum distributions of several charged particle produced
at a wide range of energies and accordingly either disprove or though confirm the relevant works
are main advantages of this review. We propose analytical expressions for the dependence of the
fit parameters obtained on the size of the colliding system, the energy, as well as the types of the
statistical approach applied. We conclude that the statistical dependence of the various fit parameters,
especially between Boltzmann and Tsallis approaches could be understood that the statistical
analysis ad hoc is biased to the corresponding degree of extensivity (Boltzmann) or nonextensivity
(Tsallis). Alternatively, the empirical parameterizations, the other models, and the generic
(non)extensive approach seem to relax this biasness.
