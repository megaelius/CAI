Monopoles have recently been discussed to be a dominant component in strong coupled quark gluon
plasma ( QGP ) and to play a role for chiral symmetry breaking as well as quark confinement. We analyze
monopole quark interactions and show that massless quarks colliding with the monopoles inevitably
change their chiralities keeping their flavors. The monopole quark interaction explicitly breaks
the chiral symmetry ( SU$_A(2)\times $U$_A$(1) ) just like bare quark masses. It is given by $\bar{q}q\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi$
with the monopole field $\Phi$. The pions are not Nambu-Goldstone bosons even in the vanishing bare
quark masses. Their masses are mainly determined by the interaction because the monopole condensation
generates a larger current quark mass than the bare quark masses. Based on the analysis of the monopole
quark interaction, we propose a phenomenological linear sigma model coupled with the monopoles.
The monopoles couple only with isoscalar scalar mesons e.g. sigma meson $\sigma$ such as $\sigma\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi$
indicated by the monopole quark interaction. The coupling explicitly breaks the chiral SU(2)$_A\times
$U$_A$(1) symmetry. Pion masses are generated by the chiral condensate, which arises only when
the monopole condensate takes place. We show that one of the monopoles is a color singlet and observable.
The monopole decays into hadrons ( pions, kaon, etc. ) through the coupling. Our analysis indicates
that $f_0(1500)$ meson is a candidate of the observable monopole. As phenomenological effects
of these monopoles, we point out that the masses of hadrons decrease in dense nuclear matters and
that chiral magnetic effects disappear in strong coupled QGP.
