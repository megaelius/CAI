We study the effects from light sfermions on the lightest Higgs boson production and decay at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We find that
the scenario with light coloured sfermions -- stops or sbottoms -- has the potential to explain a
non-universal alteration, as hinted by LHC data, of the gluon-gluon Fusion ($\mu_{ggF}$) with
respect to the Vector Boson Fusion ($\mu_{VBF}$) event rates and, in particular, can predict $\frac{\mu_{VBF}}{\mu_{ggF}}>1$
for all Higgs boson decay channels in large areas of the parameter space. We also find that the scenario
with a light stop/sbottom can be complemented by the scenario in which the total Higgs width, $\Gamma_{\rm
tot}$, is reduced due to a suppressed Yukawa coupling $Y_b$. In this case, the reduction of the Higgs
production rates in the $ggF$ process which occurs in the maximal mixing scenario is compensated
by the reduction of the $H\to b\bar{b}$ partial decay width, the largest component of $\Gamma_{\rm
tot}$. Furthermore, we highlight the fact that, in the light stop/sbottom scenario, event rates
with the Higgs boson decaying to a $b\bar{b}$ final state are predicted to be essentially below unity.
Therefore, during the future LHC runs, the measurement of $h\to b\bar{b}$ final states is a matter
of special importance. Amongst all viable MSSM configurations that we study (including revisiting
a light stau solution), we emphasise most the scenario with a light stop, as the latter is also motivated
by Dark Matter and Electro-Weak baryogenesis. For all scenarios which we study, we indicate the
specific regions of the MSSM parameter space which are compliant with LHC data, hence ameanable
to experimental investigation. We also perform fits of the MSSM against the LHC data, emphasising
the fact that in most cases these are better than for the SM.
