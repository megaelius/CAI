The Glasma is a gluonic state of matter which can be created in collisions of relativistic heavy ions
and is a precursor to the quark-gluon plasma. The existence of this state is a prediction of the color
glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. In many applications of the CGC framework, the boost invariant
approximation is employed. It assumes that the longitudinal extent of the nuclei can be approximated
as infinitesimally thin. Consequently, the Glasma produced from such a collision is boost invariant
and can be effectively described in 2+1D. Therefore, observables of the boost invariant Glasma
are by construction independent of rapidity. The main goal of this thesis is to develop a numerical
method for the non-boost-invariant setting where nuclei are assumed to be thin, but of finite longitudinal
extent. This is in conflict with a number of simplifications that are used in the boost invariant
case. In particular, one has to describe the collisions in 3+1D in the laboratory or center-of-mass
frame. The change of frame forces the explicit inclusion of the color charges of nuclei. The new method
is tested using an extension of the McLerran-Venugopalan model which includes a parameter for longitudinal
thickness. It reproduces the boost invariant setting as a limiting case. Studying the pressure
components of the Glasma, one finds the pressure anisotropy remains large. The energy density of
the Glasma depends on rapidity due to the explicit breaking of boost invariance. The width of the
observed rapidity profiles is controlled by the collision energy and can be shown to roughly agree
with experimental data. Finally, a new numerical scheme for real-time lattice gauge theory is developed
which provides higher numerical stability than the previous method. This new scheme is shown to
be gauge-covariant and conserves the Gauss constraint even for large time steps.
