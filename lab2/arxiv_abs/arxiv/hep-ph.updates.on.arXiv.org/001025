We extend the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach in the partonic sector
by explicitly calculating the total and differential partonic scattering cross sections as a function
of temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ on the basis of the effective propagators
and couplings from the Dynamical QuasiParticle Model (DQPM) that is matched to reproduce the equation
of state of the partonic system above the deconfinement temperature $T_c$ from lattice QCD. The
ratio of shear viscosity $\eta$ over entropy density $s$, i.e. $\eta/s$, is evaluated using the
collisional widths and compared to lQCD calculations for $\mu_B$ = 0 as well. We find only a very modest
change of $\eta/s$ with the baryon chemical $\mu_B$. This also holds for a variety of hadronic observables
from central A+A and C+Au collisions in the energy range 5 GeV $\leq \sqrt{s_{NN}} \leq$ 200 GeV when
implementing the differential cross sections into the PHSD approach. We only observe small differences
in the strangeness and antibaryon sector with practically no sensitivity of rapidity and $p_T$
distributions to the $\mu_B$ dependence of the partonic cross sections. Since we find only small
traces of a $\mu_B$-dependence in heavy-ion observables - although the effective partonic masses
and widths as well as their partonic cross sections clearly depend on $\mu_B$ - this implies that
one needs a sizable partonic density and large space-time QGP volume to explore the dynamics in the
partonic phase. These conditions are only fulfilled at high bombarding energies where $\mu_B$
is, however, rather low. On the other hand, when decreasing the bombarding energy and thus increasing
$\mu_B$, the hadronic phase becomes dominant and accordingly, it will be difficult to extract signals
from the partonic dynamics based on "bulk" observables.
