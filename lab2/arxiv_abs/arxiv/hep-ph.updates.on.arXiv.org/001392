Neutrino telescopes like IceCube, KM3NeT and Baikal-GVD offer physicists the opportunity to study
neutrinos with energies far beyond the reach of terrestrial accelerators. These neutrinos are
used to study high-energy neutrino interactions and to probe the Earth through absorption tomography.
Current studies of TeV neutrinos use cross sections which are calculated for free nucleons with
targets which are assumed to contain equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Here we consider modifications
of high-energy neutrino interactions due to two nuclear effects: modifications of the parton densities
in the nucleus, referred to here as shadowing, and the effect of non-isoscalar targets, with unequal
numbers of neutrons and protons. Both these effects depend on the interaction medium. Because shadowing
is larger for heavier nuclei, such as iron, found in the Earth's core, it introduces a zenith-angle
dependent change in the absorption cross section. These modifications increase the cross sections
by 1-2\% at energies below 100 TeV (antishadowing), and reduce it by 3-4\% at higher energies (shadowing).
Nuclear effects also alter the inelasticity distribution of neutrino interactions in water/ice
by increasing the number of low inelasticity interactions, with a larger effect for $\nu$ than $\bar\nu$.
These effects are particularly large in the energy range below a few TeV. These effects could alter
the cross sections inferred from events with tracks originating within the active detector volume
as well as the ratio $\nu/\bar\nu$ inferred from inelasticity measurements. The uncertainties
in these nuclear effects are larger than the uncertainties on the free-proton cross sections and
will thus limit the systematic precision of future high-precision measurements at neutrino telescopes.
