The "Cabibbo Angle Anomaly'' (CAA) originates from the disagreement between the CKM elements $V_{ud}$
and $V_{us}$ extracted from superallowed beta and kaon decays, respectively, once compared via
CKM unitarity. It points towards new physics with a significance of up to $4\,\sigma$, depending
on the theoretical input used, and can be explained through modified $W$ couplings to leptons. In
this context, vector-like leptons (VLLs) are prime candidates for a corresponding UV completion
since they can affect $W\ell\nu$ couplings at tree-level, such that this modification can have
the dominant phenomenological impact. In order to consistently asses the agreement with the data,
a global fit is necessary which we perform for gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators and all patterns
obtained for the six possible representations (under the SM gauge group) of VLLs. We find that even
in the lepton flavour universal case, including the measurements of the CKM elements $V_{us}$ and
$V_{ud}$ into the electroweak fit has a relevant impact, shifting the best fit point significantly.
Concerning the VLLs we discuss the bounds from charged lepton flavour violating processes and observe
that a single representation cannot describe experimental data significantly better than the
SM hypothesis. However, allowing for several representations of VLLs at the same time, we find that
the simple scenario in which $N$ couples to electrons via the Higgs and $\Sigma_1$ couples to muons
not only explains the CAA but also improves the rest of the electroweak fit in such a way that its best
fit point is preferred by more than $4\,\sigma$ with respect to the SM.
