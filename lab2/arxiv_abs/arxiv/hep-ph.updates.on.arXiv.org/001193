We present an analysis of the role that the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) resolution length, the minimal
distance by which two nearby colored charges in a jet must be separated such that they engage with
the plasma independently, plays in understanding the modification of jet substructure due to interaction
with QGP. We identify a set of observables that are sensitive to whether jets are quenched as if they
are single energetic colored objects or whether the medium that quenches them has the ability to
resolve the internal structure of the jet. Using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model, we find
that although the ungroomed jet mass is not suitable for this purpose (because it is more sensitive
to effects coming from particles reconstructed as a part of a jet that originate from the wake that
the jet leaves in the plasma), groomed observables such as the number of Soft Drop splittings $n_{\rm
SD}$, the momentum sharing fraction $z_g$, or the groomed jet mass are particularly well-suited
to discriminate the degree to which the QGP medium resolves substructure within a jet. In order to
find the optimal grooming strategy, we explore different cuts in the Lund plane that allow for a clear
identification of the regions of Soft Drop phase space that enhance the differences in the jet substructure
between jets in vacuum and quenched jets. Comparison with present data seems to disfavor an "infinite
resolution length", which is to say the hypothesis that the medium interacts with the jet as if it
were a single energetic colored object. Our analysis indicates that as the precision of experimental
measurements of jet substructure observables and the control over uncertainties in their calculation
improves, it will become possible to constrain the value of the resolution length of QGP, in addition
to seeing how the substructure of jets is modified via their passage through it.
