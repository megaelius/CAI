We have performed the most comprehensive resonance-model fit of $\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+$ states using
the results of our previously published partial-wave analysis (PWA) of a large data set of diffractive-dissociation
events from the reaction $\pi^- + p \to \pi^-\pi^-\pi^+ + p_\text{recoil}$ with a 190 GeV/$c$ pion
beam. The PWA results, which were obtained in 100 bins of three-pion mass, $0.5 < m_{3\pi} < 2.5$ GeV/$c^2$,
and simultaneously in 11 bins of the reduced four-momentum transfer squared, $0.1 < t' < 1.0$ $($GeV$/c)^2$,
are subjected to a resonance-model fit using Breit-Wigner amplitudes to simultaneously describe
a subset of 14 selected waves using 11 isovector light-meson states with $J^{PC} = 0^{-+}$, $1^{++}$,
$2^{++}$, $2^{-+}$, $4^{++}$, and spin-exotic $1^{-+}$ quantum numbers. The model contains the
well-known resonances $\pi(1800)$, $a_1(1260)$, $a_2(1320)$, $\pi_2(1670)$, $\pi_2(1880)$,
and $a_4(2040)$. In addition, it includes the disputed $\pi_1(1600)$, the excited states $a_1(1640)$,
$a_2(1700)$, and $\pi_2(2005)$, as well as the resonancelike $a_1(1420)$. We measure the resonance
parameters mass and width of these objects by combining the information from the PWA results obtained
in the 11 $t'$ bins. We extract the relative branching fractions of the $\rho(770) \pi$ and $f_2(1270)
\pi$ decays of $a_2(1320)$ and $a_4(2040)$, where the former one is measured for the first time.
In a novel approach, we extract the $t'$ dependence of the intensity of the resonances and of their
phases. The $t'$ dependence of the intensities of most resonances differs distinctly from the $t'$
dependence of the nonresonant components. For the first time, we determine the $t'$ dependence
of the phases of the production amplitudes and confirm that the production mechanism of the Pomeron
exchange is common to all resonances.
