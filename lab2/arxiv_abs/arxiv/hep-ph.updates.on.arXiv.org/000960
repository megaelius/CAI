The study of the internal structure of hadronic jets has become in recent years a very active area
of research in particle physics. Jet substructure techniques are increasingly used in experimental
analyses by the LHC collaborations, both in the context of searching for new physics and for Standard
Model measurements. On the theory side, the quest for a deeper understanding of jet substructure
algorithms has contributed to a renewed interest in all-order calculations in QCD. This has resulted
in new ideas about how to design better observables and how to provide a solid theoretical description
for them. In the last years, jet substructure has seen its scope extended, for example, with an increasing
impact in the study of heavy-ion collisions, or with the exploration of deep-learning techniques.
Furthermore, jet physics is an area in which experimental and theoretical approaches meet together,
where cross-pollination and collaboration between the two communities often bear the fruits of
innovative techniques. Despite the wealth of literature on this topic, we feel that a comprehensive
and, at the same time, pedagogical introduction to jet substructure is still missing. This makes
the endeavour of approaching the field particularly hard, as newcomers have to digest an increasing
number of substructure algorithms and techniques, too often characterised by opaque terminology
and jargon. Furthermore, while first-principle calculations in QCD have successfully been applied
in order to understand and characterise the substructure of jets, they often make use of calculational
techniques, such as resummation, which are not the usual textbook material. Thus, the idea of combining
our experience in different aspects of jet substructure phenomenology to put together this set
of lecture notes, which we hope could help and guide someone who moves their first steps in the physics
of jet substructure.
