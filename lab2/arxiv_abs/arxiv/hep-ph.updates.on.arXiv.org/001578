At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), several far detectors such as FASER and MATHUSLA have been proposed
to target the long-lived particles (LLPs) featured with displaced vertices. Naturally one question
arises as to the feasibility of installing similar far detectors at future lepton colliders like
the CEPC and FCC-ee. Because of the different kinematics of final state particles and the freedom
to locate both the experiment hall and the detectors, the future lepton collider with an additional
far detector may play a unique role in searching for LLPs. In this study, we consider various locations
and designs of far detectors at future $e^- e^+$ colliders and investigate their potentials for
discovering LLPs in the physics scenarios including exotic Higgs decays, heavy neutral leptons,
and the lightest neutralinos. Our analyses show that the kinematical distinctions between the
lepton and hadron colliders render the optimal positions of far detectors lying at the direction
perpendicular to the collider beams at future $e^- e^+$ colliders, in contrast to the LHC where a
boost in the forward direction can be exploited. We also find that when searching for LLPs, such new
experiments with far detectors at future lepton colliders may extend and complement the sensitivity
reaches of the experiments at the future lepton colliders with usual near detectors, and the present
and future experiments at the LHC. In particular, we find that, for the theory models considered
in this study, a MATHUSLA-sized far detector would give a modest improvement compared to the case
with a near detector only at future lepton colliders.
