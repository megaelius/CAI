We argue that the Standard Model (SM) in the Higgs phase does not suffer from a "hierarchy problem"
and that similarly the "cosmological constant problem" resolves itself if we understand the SM
as a low energy effective theory emerging from a cutoff-medium at the Planck scale. We actually take
serious Veltman's "The Infrared - Ultraviolet Connection" addressing the issue of quadratic divergences
and the related huge radiative correction predicted by the SM in the relationship between the bare
and the renormalized theory, usually called "the hierarchy problem" and claimed that this has to
be cured. We discuss these issues under the condition of a stable Higgs vacuum, which allows to extend
the SM up to the Planck cutoff. The bare Higgs boson mass then changes sign below the Planck scale,
such that the SM in the early universe is in the symmetric phase. The cutoff enhanced Higgs mass term
as well as the quartically enhanced cosmological constant term provide a large positive dark energy
which triggers the inflation of the early universe. Reheating follows via the decays of the four
unstable heavy Higgs particles, predominantly into top-antitop pairs, which at this stage are
still massless. Preheating is suppressed in SM inflation since in the symmetric phase bosonic decay
channels are absent at tree level. The coefficients of the shift between bare and renormalized Higgs
mass as well as of the shift between bare and renormalized vacuum energy density exhibit close-by
zeros at about $7.7 \times 10^{14}$ GeV and $3.1 \times 10^{15}$ GeV, respectively. The zero of of
the Higgs mass counter term triggers the electroweak phase transition from the low energy Higgs
phase and to the symmetric phase above the transition point. The scenario highly favors to understand
the SM and its main properties as a natural structure emerging at long distance.
