The electric ($\alpha_\pi$) and magnetic ($\beta_\pi$) Compton polarizabilities of both the
charged and the neutral pion are of fundamental interest in the low-energy sector of quantum chromodynamics
(QCD). Pion polarizabilities affect the shape of the $\gamma\pi\to\gamma\pi$ Compton scattering
angular distribution at back scattering angles and $\gamma\gamma\to\pi\pi$ absolute cross sections.
Theory derivations are given of the $\gamma\pi\to\gamma\pi$ Compton scattering differential
cross section, dispersion relations, and sum rules in terms of the polarizabilities. We review
experimental charged and neutral polarizability studies and theoretical predictions. The $\pi^0$
polarizabilities were deduced from DESY Crystal Ball $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^0\pi^0$ data, but
with large uncertainties. The charged pion polarizabilities were deduced most recently from (1)
radiative pion Primakoff scattering $\pi^- Z \to \pi^-Z\gamma$ at CERN COMPASS, (2) two-photon
pion pair production $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^-$ at SLAC Mark II, and (3) radiative pion photoproduction
$\gamma p\to\gamma \pi^+ n$ from the proton at MAMI in Mainz. A stringent test of chiral perturbation
theory (ChPT) is possible based on comparisons of precision experimental charged pion polarizabilities
with ChPT predictions. Only the CERN COMPASS charged pion polarizability measurement has acceptably
small uncertainties. Its value $\alpha_{\pi^\pm}-\beta_{\pi^\pm} = (4.0\pm 1.8)\times 10^{-4}\,\text{fm}^3$
agrees well with the two-loop ChPT prediction $\alpha_{\pi^\pm}-\beta_{\pi^\pm}=(5.7\pm 1.0)\times
10^{-4}\,\text{fm}^3$, strengthening the identification of the pion with the Goldstone boson
of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.
