The principle of maximum conformality (PMC) provides a way for setting the optimal renormalization
scales for high-energy processes, which can eliminate the conventional renormalization scale
error via an order-by-order manner. At present, we make a detailed PMC analysis on the Higgs decay
$H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ up to three-loop QCD corrections. As an important point of deriving
reliable PMC estimation, it is noted that only those $\{\beta_i\}$-terms that rightly determine
the running behavior of coupling constant via the renormalization group equation should be absorbed
into the coupling constant, and those $\{\beta_i\}$-terms that pertain to the quark mass renormalization
and etc. should be kept as a separate. To avoid confusion of separating and absorbing different types
of $\{\beta_i\}$-terms into the coupling constant, we first transform the decay width in terms
of top quark $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass into that of on-shell mass and then apply the PMC scale setting.
After applying PMC scale setting, the final estimation is conformal and is scheme-independent
and scale-independent. Up to three-loop QCD corrections, we obtain a PMC scale $\mu^{\rm PMC}_{r}=242.3$
GeV $\sim 2M_H$, which is optimal and highly independent of any choice of initial scale. Thus, we
obtain a more accurate scale-independent prediction by taking the Higgs mass as the same as that
of ATLAS and CMS measurements, i.e., $\Gamma(H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma)|_{\rm ATLAS}=9.502^{+0.229}_{-0.255}$
KeV and $\Gamma(H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma)|_{\rm CMS}=9.567^{+0.197}_{-0.193}$ KeV, where
the error is caused by the measured Higgs mass, i.e. the Higgs mass $M_{H}$ is taken as $125.5\pm0.2^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$
GeV for ATLAS and $125.7\pm0.3\pm0.3$ GeV for CMS, respectively.
