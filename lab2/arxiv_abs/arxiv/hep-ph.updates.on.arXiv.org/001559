Mixing of axion fields is widely used to generate EFTs with phenomenologically advantageous features,
such as hierarchies between axion couplings to different gauge fields and/or large effective field
ranges. While these features are strongly constrained by periodicity for models with only a single
axion, mixing has been used in the literature (sometimes incorrectly) to try to evade some of these
constraints. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to use axion mixing to generate an EFT of
axions that evades these constraints by flowing to a theory of a non-compact scalar in the IR. We conclude
that as long as the light axion is exactly massless, it will inherit the periodicity and associated
constraints of the UV theory. However, by giving the light axion a mass, we can relax these constraints
with effects proportional to the axion mass squared, including non-quantized couplings and the
realignment of monodromy to a light axion with a larger field range. To show this, we consider various
examples of axions mixing with other axions or with non-compact scalar fields, and work in a basis
where coupling quantization is manifest. This basis makes it clear that in the case where an axion
is eaten through the Higgs or Stuckelberg mechanism, the light axion does not have a large effective
field range, in contrast to some recent claims in the literature. Additionally, we relate our results
about axion EFTs to a well-known fact about gauge theory: that QFTs with compact gauge groups in the
UV flow to QFTs with compact gauge groups in the IR, and make this correspondence precise in the 2+1
dimensional case.
