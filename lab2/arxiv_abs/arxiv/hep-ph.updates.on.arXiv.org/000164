Naturalness predicts the existence of new physics at the TeV scale. However, given the observed
value of the Higgs mass, m_h ~ 126 GeV, and the current limits on superpartners from the LHC, supersymmetric
models are in general fine tuned in the percent to permille level depending on the model. The NMSSM
is known to be less fine tuned than the MSSM due to the presence of an additional tree-level contribution
to the physical Higgs mass --proportional to the singlet-doublet coupling, lambda. However, there
is an upper bound on lambda at the low scale (lambda <= 0.7) if one requires perturbativity to the
GUT scale. The presence of extra matter between the low and high scales relaxes the perturbativity
bound on lambda at low scales, allowing the Higgs mass at tree-level to be increased even more than
in the NMSSM. Here we present a comparative and systematic study of the fine tuning in Higgs sectors
in three scale-invariant NMSSM models: the first being the standard Z_3-invariant NMSSM; the second
is the NMSSM plus additional matter filling 3(5+5*) representations of SU(5) and is called the NMSSM+;
while the third model comprises 4(5+5*)and is called the NMSSM++. Naively, one would expect the
fine tuning in the plus-type models to be smaller than that in the NMSSM, but we find that LHC limits
on sparticles, especially the gluino mass, m_Gluino, can play an indirect, but vital, role in controlling
the fine tuning. In particular, working in a semi-constrained framework at the GUT scale, we find
that the masses of third generation stops are always larger in the plus-type models than in the NMSSM
without extra matter. This is an RGE effect which cannot be avoided, and as a consequence the fine
tuning in the NMSSM+ is significantly larger than in the NMSSM, with fine tuning in the NMSSM++ being
significantly larger than in the NMSSM+.
