We study the possibility of generating non-zero reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ by perturbing
the $\mu-\tau$ symmetric neutrino mass matrix. The leading order $\mu-\tau$ symmetric neutrino
mass matrix originates from type I seesaw mechanism whereas the perturbations to $\mu-\tau$ symmetry
originate from type II seesaw term. We consider four different realizations of $\mu-\tau$ symmetry:
Bimaximal Mixing(BM), Tri-bimaximal Mixing (TBM), Hexagonal Mixing (HM) and Golden Ratio Mixing
(GRM) all giving rise to $\theta_{13} = 0, \theta_{23} = \frac{\pi}{4}$ but different non-zero
values of solar mixing angle $\theta_{12}$. We assume a minimal $\mu-\tau$ symmetry breaking type
II seesaw mass matrix as a perturbation and calculate the neutrino oscillation parameters as a function
of type II seesaw strength. We then consider the origin of non-trivial leptonic CP phase in the charged
lepton sector and calculate the lepton asymmetry arising from the lightest right handed neutrino
decay by incorporating the presence of both type I and type II seesaw. We constrain the type II seesaw
strength as well as leptonic CP phase (and hence the charged lepton sector) by comparing our results
with experimental neutrino oscillation parameters as well as Planck bound on baryon to photon ratio.
Finally, we extend our analysis on lepton flavour violating decays like $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\mu
\to eee$ due to exchange of TeV scale Higgs triplet scalar within the low scale type II seesaw framework.
The branching ratios for these lepton flavour processes are examined with the small type II perturbation
term $\omega$ and the estimated values are very close to the experimental bound coming from current
search experiments.
