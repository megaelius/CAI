The quark rearrangement model for baryon-antibaryon annihilation and reproduction ($B\bar B\leftrightarrow
3M$) - incorporated in the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach - is extended
to the strangeness sector. A derivation of the transition probabilities for the three-body processes
is presented and a strangeness suppression factor for the invariant matrix element squared is introduced
to account for the higher mass of the strange quark compared to the light up and down quarks. In simulations
of the baryon-antibaryon annihilation and reformation in a box with periodic boundary conditions
we demonstrate that our numerical implementation fulfills detailed balance on a channel-by-channel
basis for more than 2000 individual $2 \leftrightarrow 3$ channels. Furthermore, we study central
Pb+Pb collisions within PHSD from 11.7$A$ GeV to 158$A$ GeV and investigate the impact of the additionally
implemented reaction channels in the strangeness sector. We find that the new reaction channels
have a visible impact essentially only on the rapidity spectra of antibaryons. The spectra with
the additional channels in the strangeness sector are closer to the experimental data than without
for all antihyperons. Due to the chemical redistribution between baryons/antibaryons and mesons
we find a slightly larger production of antiprotons thus moderately overestimating the available
experimental data. We additionally address the question if the antibaryon spectra (with strangeness)
from central heavy-ion reactions at these energies provide further information on the issue of
chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement. However, by comparing transport results with/without
partonic phase as well as including/excluding effects from chiral symmetry restoration we find
no convincing signals in the strange antibaryon sector for either transition due to the strong final-state
interactions.
