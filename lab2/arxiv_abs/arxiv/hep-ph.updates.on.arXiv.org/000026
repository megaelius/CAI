Colliding high energy hadrons either produce new particles or scatter elastically with their quantum
numbers conserved and no other particles produced. We consider the latter case here. Although inelastic
processes dominate at high energies, elastic scattering contributes considerably (18-25%) to
the total cross section. Its share first decreases and then increases at higher energies. Small-angle
scattering prevails at all energies. Some characteristic features are seen that provide informationon
the geometrical structure of the colliding particles and the relevant dynamical mechanisms. The
steep Gaussian peak at small angles is followed by the exponential (Orear) regime with some shoulders
and dips, and then by a power-law drop. Results from various theoretical approaches are compared
with experimental data. Phenomenological models claiming to describe this process are reviewed.
The unitarity condition predicts an exponential fall for the differential cross section with an
additional substructure to occur exactly between the low momentum transfer diffraction cone and
a power-law, hard parton scattering regime under high momentum transfer. Data on the interference
of the Coulomb and nuclear parts of amplitudes at extremely small angles provide the value of the
real part of the forward scattering nuclear amplitude. The real part of the elastic scattering amplitude
and the contribution of inelastic processes to the imaginary part of this amplitude (the so-called
overlap function) at nonforward transferred momenta are also discussed. Problems related to the
scaling behavior of the differential cross section are considered. The power-law regime at highest
momentum transfer is briefly described.
