Two-neutrino double-beta decay of certain nuclear isotopes is one of the rarest Standard Model
processes observed in nature. Its neutrinoless counterpart is an exotic lepton-number nonconserving
process that is widely searched for to determine if the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. In order
to connect the rate of these processes to the Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model interactions,
it is essential that the corresponding nuclear matrix elements are constrained reliably from theory.
Lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) and low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) are expected
to play an essential role in constraining the matrix element of the two-nucleon subprocess, which
could in turn provide the input into ab initio nuclear-structure calculations in larger isotopes.
Focusing on the two-neutrino process $nn \to pp \, (ee \bar{\nu}_e\bar{\nu}_e)$, the amplitude
is constructed in this work in pionless EFT at next-to-leading order, demonstrating the emergence
of a renormalization-scale independent amplitude and the absence of any new low-energy constant
at this order beyond those present in the single-weak process. Most importantly, it is shown how
a LQCD four-point correlation function in Euclidean and finite-volume spacetime can be used to
constrain the Minkowski infinite-volume amplitude in the EFT. The same formalism is provided for
the related single-weak process, which is an input to the double-$\beta$ decay formalism. The LQCD-EFT
matching procedure outlined for the double-weak amplitude paves the road toward constraining
the two-nucleon matrix element entering the neutrinoless double-beta decay amplitude with a light
Majorana neutrino.
