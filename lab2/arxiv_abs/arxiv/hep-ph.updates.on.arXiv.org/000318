Approaches based on viscous hydrodynamics for the hot and dense stage and hadronic transport for
the final dilute rescattering stage are successfully applied to the dynamic description of heavy
ion reactions at high beam energies. One crucial step in such hybrid approaches is the so called particlization,
the transition between the hydrodynamic description to microscopic degrees of freedom. For this
purpose, individual particles are sampled on the Cooper-Frye hypersurface. In this work, 4 different
realizations of sampling algorithms are compared, where three of them incorporate global conservation
laws of quantum numbers in each event. The algorithms are compared within two types of scenarios:
simple "box" hypersurface consisting of only one static cell and a typical particlization hypersurface
for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV. For all algorithms the mean multiplicities
(or particle spectra) remain unaffected by global conservation laws in the case of large volumes.
In contrast, the fluctuations of the particle numbers are affected considerably. The fluctuations
of the newly developed SPREW algorithm based on exponential weights and the recently suggested
SER algorithm based on ensemble rejection are smaller than without conservation laws and agree
with the expectation from the canonical ensemble. The previously applied mode sampling algorithm
produces dramatically larger fluctuations, than it is expected in the corresponding microcanonical
ensemble, and therefore should be avoided in fluctuation studies. This study might be of interest
for investigations of particle fluctuations and correlations, e.g. the suggested signatures
for a phase transition or a critical endpoint, in hybrid approaches that are affected by global conservation
laws.
