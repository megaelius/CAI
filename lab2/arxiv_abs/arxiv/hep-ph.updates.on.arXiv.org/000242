Background: A component of azimuth correlations from high-energy heavy ion collisions varying
as $\cos(2\phi)$ and denoted by symbol $v_2$ is conventionally interpreted to represent "elliptic
flow," a hydrodynamic manifestation of the initial-state \aa overlap geometry. Several numerical
methods are used to estimate $v_2$, resulting in various combinations of "flow" and "nonflow" that
reveal systematic biases in the $v_2$ estimates. QCD jets contribute strongly to azimuth correlations
and specifically to the $\cos(2\phi)$ component. Purpose: We question the extent of jet-related
("nonflow") bias in and hydrodynamic "flow" interpretations of $v_2$ measurements. Method: We
introduce two-dimensional (2D) model fits to angular correlation data that distinguish accurately
between jet-related correlation components and a {\em nonjet azimuth quadrupole} that might represent
"elliptic flow" if that were relevant. We compare measured jet-related and "flow"-related data
systematics and determine the jet-related contribution to $v_2$ measurements. Results: Jet structure
does introduce substantial bias to conventional $v_2$ measurements, making interpretation difficult.
The nonjet quadrupole exhibits very simple systematics on centrality and collision energy---the
two variables factorize. Within a \auau centrality interval where jets show no indication of rescattering
or medium effects the nonjet quadrupole amplitude rises to 60% of its maximum value. Conclusions:
Disagreements between nonjet quadrupole systematics and hydro theory expectations, the large
quadrupole amplitudes observed in more-peripheral \auau collisions and a significant nonzero
value in \nn $\approx$ \pp collisions strongly suggest that the nonjet quadrupole does not arise
from a hydrodynamic "flow" mechanism.
