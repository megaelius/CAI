Experimental data on $ R(D^{(*)}) $, $ R(K^{(*)}) $ and $ R(J/\psi) $ have shown sizable deviations
from the SM predictions. To look for similar possible anomalies in baryonic sector, we investigate
the effects of a vector leptoquark $U_3 (3,3, \frac{2}{3})$ on various physical quantities related
to the tree-level $ \Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda_c \ell ~ \overline{\nu}_\ell$ decays. We calculate
the differential branching ratio and forward-backward asymmetry at $ \mu $ and $ \tau $ lepton channels
in leptoquark model and compare their behavior with respect to $ q^2 $ with the predictions of the
standard model (SM). In the calculations we use the form factors calculated in full QCD as the main
inputs and take into account all the errors coming from the form factors and model parameters. It
is observed that, at $ \tau $ channel, the $ R_A $ fit solution to data related to the leptoquark model
sweeps some regions out of the SM band but it has a considerable intersection with the SM predictions.
The $ R_B$ type solution gives roughly the same results with the those of the SM on $ DBR(q^2)-q^2$.
At $ \mu $ channel, the leptoquark model gives consistent results with the SM predictions on the behavior
of $ DBR(q^2)$ with respect to $ q^2 $. As far as the $ q^2 $ behavior of the $ A_{FB}(q^2) $ is concerned,
the two types of fits in leptoquark model for $ \tau $ and the the predictions of this model at $ \mu $
channel give exactly the same results as the SM. We also investigate the behavior of the popular parameter
$ R(q^2) $ with respect to $ q^2 $ and the value of $ R(\Lambda_c) $ both in vector leptoquark and SM models.
Both types fit solutions lead to results that deviate considerably from the SM predictions on $DBR(q^2)-
q^2 $ as well as $ R(\Lambda_c) $ ....
