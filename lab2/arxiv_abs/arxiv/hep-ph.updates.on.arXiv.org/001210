Finding the existence and the location of the QCD critical point on the temperature T and baryon chemical
potential $\mu_{b}$ plane is one of the main goals of the RHIC beam energy scan program. To make theoretical
predictions and corroborate with the experimental data requires modelling the space-time evolution
of the matter created in heavy-ion collisions by some dynamical models such as the relativistic
hydrodynamics with a proper Equation of State (EoS). In the present exploratory study, we use a newly
developed ideal 2+1 dimensional event-by-event (e-by-e) hydrodynamic code with two different
Equation of State (EoS) (i) Lattice QCD + HRG EoS with a crossover transition, (ii) EoS with a first-order
phase transition. Using the MC-Glauber model initial condition we calculate the event-by-event
distribution of flow coefficients $v_{n}$ and eccentricities $\epsilon_{n}$ ($n=2-4$) for two
different centrality Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. We show that the Pearson correlation
coefficient $c(v_{2},v_{3})$ and $c(v_{3},v_{4})$ can be used as an EoS meter. We found $\sim 10\%$
difference in $c(v_{2},v_{3})$ and $c(v_{3},v_{4})$ for the two different EoSs for $20\%-30\%$
collision centrality irrespective of the initial condition used. The same observable was shown
to be quite insensitive to the initial state fluctuation and/or shear viscosity of the medium in
a previous study by Niemi et al. This indicates that these observables can be used to gain information
about the QCD EoS from experimental data. In addition to that, we also found $\sim 15\% -30\%$ difference
(depending on the model parameters and centrality of the collisions) in $c(\epsilon_{n}, v_{n})$
for $n=2-4$ for the two different EoSs. These observations may be attributed to very different evolutionary
dynamics of the system for the two different EoS.
