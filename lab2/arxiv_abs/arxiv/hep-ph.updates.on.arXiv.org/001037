To constrain the properties of dark matter (DM) that interacts with nucleons, we have conducted
an experimental search for any anomalous heating of ordinary baryonic matter at 77 K. Our tabletop
experiment is motivated by the possibility (discussed in a previous paper) that DM particles with
masses in the $\sim 1 - 2 m_{\rm p}$ range could be captured by and concentrated within the Earth. For
suitable parameters, this phenomenon could lead to a substantial density $\sim 10^{14}\,\rm cm^{-3}$
of thermalized (300 K) DM particles at Earth's surface that would heat cooler baryonic matter. Our
experiment involves precise differential measurements of the evaporation rate of liquid nitrogen
in a storage dewar within which various materials are immersed. The results revealed no statistically-significant
detections of heating in the 27 elements with molar fractions $> 10^{-5}$ in Earth's crust. For material
with the average composition of Earth's crust, our measurements imply a $3 \sigma$ upper limit of
$1.32 \times 10^{-27}\, n_{\rm 14}^{-1} (m_{\rm DM}/2\,m_{\rm p})^{-1/2}\,\rm cm^2$ on the mean
cross-section for scattering with thermal HIDM at 300 K, where $10^{14}\,n_{14} \, \rm cm^{-3}$
is the particle density at Earth's surface. In combination with a lower limit on the scattering cross-section,
obtained from a consideration of the heat flow through the Earth's crust (Neufeld, Farrar & McKee
2018), our experiment places an upper limit of $1.6 \times 10^{13}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ on the density
of DM at the Earth's surface. This in turn, significantly constrains the properties for any DM candidate
that interacts with baryons.
