We analyze signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from production and decay of Kaluza-Klein
(KK) gravitons in the context of "extended" warped extra-dimensional models, where the standard
model (SM) Higgs and fermion fields are restricted to be in-between the usual ultraviolet/Planck
brane and a $\sim O(10)$ TeV (new, "intermediate") brane, whereas the SM gauge fields (and gravity)
propagate further down to the $\sim O( \hbox{TeV} )$ infrared brane. Such a framework suppresses
flavor violation stemming from KK particle effects, while keeping the KK gauge bosons and gravitons
accessible to the LHC. We find that the signals from KK graviton are significantly different than
in the standard warped model. This is because the usually dominant decay modes of KK gravitons into
top quark, Higgs and longitudinal $W/Z$ particles are suppressed by the above spatial separation
between these two sets of particles, thus other decay channels are allowed to shine themselves.
In particular, we focus on two novel decay channels of the KK graviton. The first one is the decay into
a pair of radions, each of which decays (dominantly) into a pair of SM gluons, resulting in a resonant
4-jet final state consisting of two pairs of dijet resonance. On the other hand, if the radion is heavier
and/or KK gluon is lighter, then the KK graviton mostly decays into a KK gluon and a SM gluon. The resulting
KK gluon has a significant decay branching fraction into radion and SM gluon, thereby generating
(again) a 4-jet signature, but with a different underlying event topology, i.e., featuring now
three different resonances. We demonstrate that the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) has sensitivity
to KK graviton of (up to) $\sim 4$ TeV in both channels, whereas it is unlikely to have sensitivity
in the standard dijet resonance search channel from KK graviton decay into two gluons.
