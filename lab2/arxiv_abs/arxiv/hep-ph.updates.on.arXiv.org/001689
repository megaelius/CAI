Within the Type-I seesaw mechanism, quantum effects of the right-handed (RH) neutrinos in the gravitational
background lead to an asymmetric propagation of lepton and anti-leptons. This induces a curvature
and Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling dependent chemical potential and therefore a lepton asymmetry
in equilibrium. At high temperature, lepton number violating scattering processes try to maintain
a dynamically generated lepton asymmetry in equilibrium. However, when the temperature drops
down, the interactions become weaker, and the asymmetry freezes out. The frozen out asymmetry can
act as a pre-existing asymmetry prior to the standard Fukugita-Yanagida leptogenesis phase ($T_i\sim
M_i$, where $M_i$ is the mass of $i$th RH neutrino). It is then natural to consider the viability of
gravitational leptogenesis for a given RH mass spectrum which is not consistent with successful
leptogenesis from decays. Primary threat to this gravity-induced lepton asymmetry to be able to
successfully reproduce the observed baryon-to-photon ratio is the lepton number violating washout
processes at $T_i\sim M_i$. In a minimal seesaw set up with two RH neutrinos, these washout processes
are strong enough to erase a pre-existing asymmetry of significant magnitude. We show that when
effects of flavour on the washout processes are taken into account, the mechanism opens up the possibility
of successful leptogenesis (gravitational) for a mass spectrum $M_2\gg 10^9 {\rm GeV}\gg M_1$
with $M_1 \gtrsim 6.3 \times 10^6$ GeV. We then briefly discuss how, in general, the mechanism leaves
its imprints on the low energy CP phases and absolute light neutrino mass scale.
