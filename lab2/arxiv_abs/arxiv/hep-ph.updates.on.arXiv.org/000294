We present updated constraints on the free-streaming nature of cosmological neutrinos from cosmic
microwave background (CMB) power spectra, baryonic acoustic oscillation data, and local measurements
of the Hubble constant. Specifically, we consider a Fermi-like four-fermion interaction between
massless neutrinos, characterized by an effective coupling constant $ G_{\rm eff}$, and resulting
in a neutrino opacity $\dot{\tau}_\nu\propto G_{\rm eff}^2 T_\nu^5$. Using a conservative prior
on the parameter $\log_{10}\left(G_{\rm eff} {\rm MeV}^2\right)$, we find a bimodal posterior
distribution. The first of these modes is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
and corresponds to neutrinos decoupling at redshift $z_{\nu,{\rm dec}} > 1.3\times10^5$. The
other mode of the posterior, dubbed the "interacting neutrino mode", corresponds to neutrino decoupling
occurring within a narrow redshift window centered around $z_{\nu,{\rm dec}}\sim8300$. This
mode is characterized by a high value of the effective neutrino coupling constant, together with
a lower value of the scalar spectral index and amplitude of fluctuations, and a higher value of the
Hubble parameter. Using both a maximum likelihood analysis and the ratio of the two mode's Bayesian
evidence, we find the interacting neutrino mode to be statistically disfavored compared to the
standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Interestingly, the addition of CMB polarization and direct
Hubble constant measurements significantly raises the statistical significance of this secondary
mode, indicating that new physics in the neutrino sector could help explain the difference between
local measurements of $H_0$, and those inferred from CMB data. A robust consequence of our results
is that neutrinos must be free streaming long before the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
