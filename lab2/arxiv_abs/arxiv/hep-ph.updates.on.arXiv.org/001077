We report the effect of including repulsive interactions on various thermodynamic observables
calculated using a S-matrix based Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model to already available corresponding
results with only attractive interactions [A. Dash, S. Samanta, and B. Mohanty, Phys. Rev. C 97,
055208 (2018)]. The attractive part of the interaction is calculated by parameterizing the two
body phase shifts using K-matrix formalism while the repulsive part is included by fitting to the
experimental phase shifts which carry the information about the nature of the interaction. We find
that the bulk thermodynamic variables for a gas of hadrons such as energy density, pressure, entropy
density, speed of sound and specific heat are suppressed by the inclusion of repulsive interactions
and are more pronounced for second and higher order correlations and fluctuations, particularly
for the observables $\chi^2_Q$, $\chi^2_B-\chi^4_B$ and $C_{BS}$ in the present model. We find
a good agreement between lattice QCD simulations and the present model for $C_{BS}$. We have also
computed two leading order Fourier coefficients of the imaginary part of the first order baryonic
susceptibility at imaginary baryon chemical potential within this model and compared them with
the corresponding results from lattice. Additionally, assuming that the value of interacting
pressure versus temperature for a gas of hadrons calculated in S-matrix formalism is same as that
from a van der Waals HRG (VDWHRG) model, we have quantified the attractive and repulsive interactions
in our model in terms of attractive and repulsive parameters used in the VDWHRG model. The values
of parameters thus obtained are $a=1.54\pm 0.064$ GeV $\text{fm}^{3}$ and $r=0.81\pm 0.014$ fm.
