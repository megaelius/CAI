Towards experimental confirmations of the type-I seesaw mechanism, we explore a prospect of discovering
the heavy Majorana right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) from a resonant production of a new massive gauge
boson ($Z^{\prime}$) and its subsequent decay into a pair of RHNs ($Z^{\prime}\to NN$) at the future
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Recent simulation studies have shown that the discovery of the RHNs
through this process is promising in the future. However, the current LHC data very severely constrains
the production cross section of $Z^{\prime}$ boson into dilepton final states, $pp \to Z^{\prime}\to
\ell^{+}\ell^{-} $ ($\ell=e$ or $\mu$). Extrapolating the current bound to the future, we find
that a significant enhancement of the branching ratio ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN$) over ${\rm
BR}(Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$) is necessary for the future discovery of RHNs. As a well-motivated
simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) to incorporate the $Z^\prime$ boson and the type-I seesaw
mechanism, we consider the minimal U(1)$_X$ model, which is a generalization of the well-known
minimal $B-L$ model without extension of the particle content. We point out that this model can yield
a significant enhancement up to ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN)/{\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-})
\simeq 5$ (per generation). This is in sharp contrast with the minimal $B-L$ model, a benchmark model
commonly used in simulation studies, which predicts ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN)/{\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to
\ell^{+}\ell^{-}) \simeq 0.5$. With such an enhancement and a realistic model-parameter choice
to reproduce the neutrino oscillation data, we conclude that the possibility of discovering RHNs
in the future implies that the LHC experiments will soon discover the $Z^\prime$ boson.
