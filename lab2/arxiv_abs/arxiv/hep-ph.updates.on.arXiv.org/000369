We investigate the ability of two particular scalar leptoquarks to address the recent hints of lepton
universality violation in $B$ meson decays. These leptoquarks --- $S_3 (\overline{\mathbf{3}},\mathbf{3},1/3)$
and $\tilde{R}_2(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2},1/6)$ --- naturally emerge in the context of an $SU(5)$
GUT model without any conflict with the stringent limits from observed proton stability. Scalar
leptoquark $S_3$ with left-handed couplings to 2nd and 3rd generations of charged leptons and down-type
quarks seems well-suited to address both $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}$. We quantify this suitability
with numerical fits to a plethora of relevant flavor observables. The second state, i.e., $\tilde{R}_2$,
can help generate gauge coupling unification and neutrino masses in the context of the proposed
$SU(5)$ model. We accordingly include it in our study to investigate $\tilde{R}_2$'s ability to
offset adverse effects of $S_3$ and thus improve a quality of numerical fits. A global fit of the leptoquark
Yukawa couplings shows that large couplings of light $S_3$ to $\tau$ leptons are preferred, whereas
contributions of $\tilde R_2$ are not beneficial after all. We furthermore identify $B \to K^{(*)}
\bar\nu\nu$ as the most sensitive channel to probe the preferred region of parameter space. Large
couplings of $S_3$ to $\tau$ leptons are finally confronted with the experimental searches for
$\tau$ final states at the Large Hadron Collider. These searches comprise a study of decay products
of the leptoquark pair production, as well as, and more importantly, an analysis of the high-mass
$\tau\tau$ final states.
