We investigate the implications of the general frame approach for conformal Bjorken flow beyond
the earlier studies. We show that the power series solution at late times is not unique and is accompanied
by an exact solution of the form $1/\tau$, which becomes unphysical if taken on shell. In contrast
to the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart formalism, a matching between $\NFSYM$ results and the hydro expansion
is only possible up to the first order, which gives rise to $\eta/s=1/4\pi$. Matching the results
to the next order gives rise to causality/stability-violating values. Furthermore, we show that
the pressure anisotropy in the general frame cannot capture the hydrodynamization, and we introduce
an alternative measure to find the attractor. Using slow-roll expansion, we find an analytical
approximation form for the attractor. We also show that the early-time behavior of attractors is
related to stability and causality conditions. The attractor solutions outside the stable and
causal regime give rise to reheating and negative longitudinal pressures in early times, in contrast
to the stable and causal ones. We also comment on the violation of the second law of thermodynamics
by the off-shell parameters. We show that for the stable and causal choice of parameters, the off-shell
canonical entropy of the attractors, which is not a physical quantity, has a negative divergence
in early times before tending to its on-shell limit. On the other hand, the unstable and acausal attractors
have non-negative entropy divergence. We speculate that the violation of the second law by stable
and causal off-shell parameters is required for stability of the first-order hydrodynamics. We
investigate the analytical structure of the Borel-transformed series and find the proper relation
between the poles and nonhydro modes.
