We perform a comprehensive study of The Higgs potential of the two Higgs doublet model extended by
a real triplet scalar field $\Delta$. This model, dubbed 2HDM+T, has a rich Higgs spectrum consisting
of three CP-even Higgs h_{1,2,3}, one CP-odd A_0 and two pairs of charged Higgs H^\pm_{1,2}. First,
we determine the perturbative unitarity constraints and a set of non trivial conditions for the
boundedness from below (BFB). Then we derive the Veltman conditions by considering the quadratic
divergencies of Higgs boson self energies in 2HDM+T. We find that the parameter space is severely
delimited by these theoretical constraints, as well as experimental exclusion limits and Higgs
signal rate measurements at LEP and LHC. Using HiggsBounds-5.3.2beta and HiggSignals-2.2.3beta
public codes an exclusion test at 2\sigma is then performed on the physical scalars of 2HDM+T. Our
analysis provides a clear insight on the nonstandard scalar masses, showing that the allowed ranges
are strongly sensitive to the sign of mixing angle \alpha_1, essentially when naturalness is involved.
For \alpha_1 < 0 scenario, our results place higher limits on the bounds of all scalar masses, particularly
on m_{h_3} and m_{H_2^\pm} which are predicted to be nearly mass degenerate varying within the interval
[179, 290] GeV. When \alpha_1 turns positive, we show that consistency with theoretical constraints
and current LHC data, essentially on the diphoton decay channel, favors Higgs masses varying within
wide allowed ranges: [153, 973] GeV for m_{A_0}; [151, 929] GeV for (m_{h_2}, m_{H_1^\pm}) and [186,
979] GeV for (m_{h_3}, m_{H_2^\pm}). Finally, we find that the \gamma \gamma and Z\gamma Higgs decay
modes are generally correlated if \tan \beta lies within the reduced intervals 18 \le \tan \beta
\le 25 and \lambda_b parameter is frozen around 4 (3.75) for \sin \alpha_1 > 0 (\sin \alpha_1 < 0).
