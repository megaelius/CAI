In this paper we further develop a string model of hadrons by computing their strong decay widths
and comparing them to experiment. The main decay mechanism is that of a string splitting into two
strings. The corresponding total decay width behaves as $\Gamma=\frac\pi2 ATL$ where $T$ and $L$
are the tension and length of the string and $A$ is a dimensionless universal constant. We show that
this result holds for a bosonic string not only in the critical dimension. The partial width of a given
decay mode is given by $\Gamma_i/\Gamma=\Phi_i\exp(-2\pi Cm_{sep}^2/T)$ where $\Phi_i$ is a
phase space factor, $m_{sep}$ is the mass of the "quark" and "antiquark" created at the splitting
point, and $C$ is a dimensionless coefficient close to unity. Based on the spectra of hadrons we observe
that their (modified) Regge trajectories are characterized by a negative intercept. This implies
a repulsive Casimir force that gives the string a "zero point length". We fit the theoretical decay
width to experimental data for mesons on the trajectories of $\rho$, $\omega$, $\pi$, $\eta$, $K^*$,
$\phi$, $D$, and $D^*_s$, and of the baryons $N$, $\Delta$, $\Lambda$, and $\Sigma$. We examine
both the linearity in $L$ and the exponential suppression factor. The linearity was found to agree
with the data well for mesons but less for baryons. The extracted coefficient for mesons $A=0.095\pm0.015$
is indeed quite universal. The exponential suppression was applied to both strong and radiative
decays. We discuss the relation with string fragmentation and jet formation. We extract the quark-diquark
structure of baryons from their decays. A stringy mechanism for Zweig suppressed decays of quarkonia
is proposed and is shown to reproduce the decay width of $\Upsilon$ states. The dependence of the
width on spin and flavor symmetry is discussed. We further apply this model to the decays of glueballs
and exotic hadrons.
