Dileptons are considered as one of the cleanest signals of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), however,
the QGP radiation is masked by many 'background' sources from either hadronic decays or semileptonic
decays from correlated charm pairs. In this study we investigate the relative contribution of these
channels in heavy-ion collisions from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 8 GeV to 5 TeV with a focus on the competition
between the thermal QGP radiation and the semileptonic decays from correlated $D-$meson pairs.
As a 'tool' we employ the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach to study dilepton
spectra in Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions in a wide energy range incorporating for the first time a fully
microscopic treatment of the charm dynamics and their semileptonic decays. We find that the dileptons
from correlated $D-$meson decays dominate the 'thermal' radiation from the QGP in central Pb+Pb
collisions at the intermediate masses (1.2 GeV $< M <$ 3 GeV) for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} > $ 40 GeV, while
for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 8 to 20 GeV the contribution from $D,{\bar D}$ decays to the intermediate
mass dilepton spectra is subleading such that one should observe a rather clear signal from the QGP
radiation. We, furthermore, study the $p_T$-spectra and the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of single electrons
at different energies as well as the excitation function of the inverse slope of the $m_T$- spectra
for intermediate-mass dileptons from the QGP and from charm decays. We find moderate but characteristic
changes in the inverse slope parameter for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} > $ 20 GeV which can be observed experimentally
in high statistics data. Additionally, we provide detailed predictions for dilepton spectra from
Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 5.02 TeV.
