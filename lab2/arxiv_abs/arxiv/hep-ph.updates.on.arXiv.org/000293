This work is dedicated to the memory of R. Stora. In the Linear Sigma Model (LSM), towers of Ward-Takahashi
Identities (WTI) relate both 1-Scalar-Particle-Irreducible Green's functions and I-SP-Reducible
T-Matrix elements for external scalars (a doublet H and 3 pseudoscalars $\pi$). We extend these
WTI to the $SU(3)_CxSU(2)_LxU(1)_Y$ LSM including Standard Model (SM) fermions -- the ungauged
SM -- supplemented with right-handed neutrinos -- to extract powerful constraints on the effective
Lagrangian. The crucial observation is that ultraviolet quadratic divergences (UVQD) and all
other relevant operators, contribute only to $m_\pi$, a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) mass
appearing in intermediate calculations. The Goldstone Theorem enforces m=0 exactly for the true
NGB in the theory's spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) mode, causing all relevant operator contributions,
to vanish identically to all loop orders! A weak-scale renormalized H pole mass and <H> are therefore
not fine-tuned (FT) -- they are Goldstone Exceptional Natural (GEN), a more powerful suppression
of FT than accepted naturalness criteria. GEN is another (unfamiliar) consequence of global axial-vector
WTI, SSB and the Goldstone Theorem, and is a new exact property of the model's vacuum, spectrum and
dynamics. We show that our regularization-scheme-independent, WTI-driven results are unchanged
by addition of certain heavy matter. The Goldstone theorem and global axial-vector WTI still cause
all UVQD and finite relevant operators to vanish. We demonstrate with two examples: a heavy singlet
real scalar field S with discrete $Z_2$ symmetry and <S>=0; and a heavy singlet right-handed Type
I See-saw Majorana neutrino. Specifically, we prove that these heavy degrees of freedom decouple
completely from the low-energy effective Lagrangian, contributing only irrelevant operators
after quartic-coupling renormalization.
