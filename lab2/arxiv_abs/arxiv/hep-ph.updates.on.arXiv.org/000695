We study four-dimensional adjoint QCD with gauge group SU(2) and two Weyl fermion flavors, which
has an $SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry. The infrared behavior of this theory is not firmly established.
We explore candidate infrared phases by embedding adjoint QCD into $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory deformed by a supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M that preserves all global
symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. This includes 't Hooft anomalies that are only visible when the
theory is placed on manifolds that do not admit a spin structure. The consistency of this procedure
is guaranteed by a nonabelian spin-charge relation involving the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry that is familiar
from topologically twisted $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. Since every vacuum on the Coulomb branch
of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory necessarily matches all 't Hooft anomalies, we can generate candidate
phases for adjoint QCD by deforming the theories in these vacua while preserving all symmetries
and 't Hooft anomalies. One such deformation is the supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M itself,
which can be reliably analyzed when M is small. In this regime it gives rise to an exotic Coulomb phase
without chiral symmetry breaking. By contrast, the theory near the monopole and dyon points can
be deformed to realize a candidate phase with monopole-induced confinement and chiral symmetry
breaking. The low-energy theory consists of two copies of a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model, which
we analyze in detail. Certain topological couplings that are likely to be present in this $\mathbb{CP}^1$
model turn the confining solitonic string of the model into a topological insulator. We also examine
the behavior of various candidate phases under fermion mass deformations. We speculate on the possible
large-M behavior of the deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory and conjecture that the $\mathbb{CP}^1$
phase eventually becomes dominant.
