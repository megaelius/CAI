We propose to create a secondary beam of neutral kaons in Hall D at Jefferson Lab to be used with the
GlueX experimental setup for strange hadron spectroscopy. The superior CEBAF electron beam will
enable a flux on the order of $1\times 10^4~K_L/sec$, which exceeds the flux of that previously attained
at SLAC by three orders of magnitude. The use of a deuteron target will provide first measurements
ever with neutral kaons on neutrons. The experiment will measure both differential cross sections
and self-analyzed polarizations of the produced $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ hyperons
using the GlueX detector at the Jefferson Lab Hall D. The measurements will span CM $\cos\theta$
from $-0.95$ to 0.95 in the range W = 1490 MeV to 2500 MeV. The new data will significantly constrain
the partial wave analyses and reduce model-dependent uncertainties in the extraction of the properties
and pole positions of the strange hyperon resonances, and establish the orbitally excited multiplets
in the spectra of the $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ hyperons. Comparison with the corresponding multiplets
in the spectra of the charm and bottom hyperons will provide insight into he accuracy of QCD-based
calculations over a large range of masses. The proposed facility will have a defining impact in the
strange meson sector through measurements of the final state $K\pi$ system up to 2 GeV invariant
mass. This will allow the determination of pole positions and widths of all relevant $K^\ast(K\pi)$
$S$-,$P$-,$D$-,$F$-, and $G$-wave resonances, settle the question of the existence or nonexistence
of scalar meson $\kappa/K_0^\ast(700)$ and improve the constrains on their pole parameters. Subsequently
improving our knowledge of the low-lying scalar nonet in general.
