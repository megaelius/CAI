We document major new features and improvements of FlexibleSUSY, a Mathematica and C++ package
with a dependency on the external package SARAH, that generates fast and precise spectrum generators.
The extensions presented here significantly increase the generality and capabilities of the FlexibleSUSY
package, which already works with a wide class of models, while maintaining an elegant structure
and easy to use interfaces. The FlexibleBSM extension makes it possible to also create spectrum
generators for non-supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. The FlexibleCPV extension
adds the option of complex parameters to the spectrum generators, allowing the study of many interesting
models with new sources of $CP$ violation. FlexibleMW computes the decay of the muon for the generated
model and thereby allows FlexibleSUSY to predict the mass of the $W$ boson from the input parameters
by using the more precise electroweak input of $\{ G_F, M_Z, \alpha_{\text{em}} \}$ instead of $\{
M_W, M_Z, \alpha_{\text{em}} \}$. The FlexibleAMU extension provides a calculator of the anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon in any model FlexibleSUSY can generate a spectrum for. FlexibleSAS introduces
a new solver for the boundary value problem which makes use of semi-analytic expressions for dimensionful
parameters to find solutions in models where the classic two-scale solver will not work such as the
constrained E$_6$SSM. FlexibleEFTHiggs is a hybrid calculation of the Higgs mass which combines
the virtues of both effective field theory calculations and fixed-order calculations. All of these
extensions are included in FlexibleSUSY 2.0, which is released simultaneously with this manual.
