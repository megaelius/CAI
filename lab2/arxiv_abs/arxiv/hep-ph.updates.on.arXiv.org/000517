The evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals is one of the main challenges in the computation
of precise theoretical predictions for the cross sections measured at the LHC. In recent years,
the method of differential equations has proven to be a powerful tool for the computation of Feynman
integrals. It has been observed that the differential equation of Feynman integrals can in many
instances be transformed into a so-called canonical form, which significantly simplifies its
integration in terms of iterated integrals. The main result of this thesis is an algorithm to compute
rational transformations of differential equations of Feynman integrals into a canonical form.
Apart from requiring the existence of such a rational transformation, the algorithm needs no further
assumptions about the differential equation. In particular, it is applicable to problems depending
on multiple kinematic variables and also allows for a rational dependence on the dimensional regulator.
First, the transformation law is expanded in the dimensional regulator to derive differential
equations for the coefficients of the transformation. Using an ansatz in terms of rational functions,
these differential equations are then solved to determine the transformation. This thesis also
presents an implementation of the algorithm in the Mathematica package CANONICA, which is the first
publicly available program to compute transformations to a canonical form for differential equations
depending on multiple variables. The main functionality and its usage are illustrated with some
simple examples. Furthermore, the package is applied to state-of-the-art integral topologies
appearing in recent multi-loop calculations. These topologies depend on up to three variables
and include previously unknown topologies contributing to higher-order corrections to the cross
section of single top-quark production at the LHC.
