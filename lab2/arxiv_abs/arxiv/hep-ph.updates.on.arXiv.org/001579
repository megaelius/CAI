We have performed the first $n_f = 2+1+1$ lattice QCD computations of the properties (masses and
decay constants) of ground-state charmonium mesons. Our calculation uses the HISQ action to generate
quark-line connected two-point correlation functions on MILC gluon field configurations that
include $u/d$ quark masses going down to the physical point, tuning the $c$ quark mass from $M_{J/\psi}$
and including the effect of the $c$ quark's electric charge through quenched QED. We obtain $M_{J/\psi}-M_{\eta_c}$
(connected) = 120.3(1.1) MeV and interpret the difference with experiment as the impact on $M_{\eta_c}$
of its decay to gluons, missing from the lattice calculation. This allows us to determine $\Delta
M_{\eta_c}^{\mathrm{annihiln}}$ =+7.3(1.2) MeV, giving its value for the first time. Our result
of $f_{J/\psi}=$ 0.4104(17) GeV, gives $\Gamma(J/\psi \rightarrow e^+e^-)$=5.637(49) keV,
in agreement with, but now more accurate than experiment. At the same time we have improved the determination
of the $c$ quark mass, including the impact of quenched QED to give $\overline{m}_c(3\,\mathrm{GeV})$
= 0.9841(51) GeV. We have also used the time-moments of the vector charmonium current-current correlators
to improve the lattice QCD result for the $c$ quark HVP contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment
of the muon. We obtain $a_{\mu}^c = 14.638(47) \times 10^{-10}$, which is 2.5$\sigma$ higher than
the value derived using moments extracted from some sets of experimental data on $R(e^+e^- \rightarrow
\mathrm{hadrons})$. This value for $a_{\mu}^c$ includes our determination of the effect of QED
on this quantity, $\delta a_{\mu}^c = 0.0313(28) \times 10^{-10}$.
