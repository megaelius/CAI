The dynamics of baryon-antibaryon annihilation and reproduction ($B{\bar B} \leftrightarrow
3 M$) is studied within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach for Pb+Pb
and Au+Au collisions as a function of centrality from lower Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) up to
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies on the basis of the quark rearrangement model (QRM). At Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) energies we find a small net reduction of baryon-antibaryon ($B {\bar
B}$) pairs while for the LHC energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 GeV a small net enhancement is found
relative to calculations without annihilation (and reproduction) channels. Accordingly, the
sizeable difference between data and statistical calculations in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=
2.76 TeV for proton and antiproton yields \cite{53}, where a deviation of 2.7 $\sigma$ was claimed
by the ALICE Collaboration, should not be attributed to a net antiproton annihilation. This is in
line with the observation that no substantial deviation between the data and statistical hadronization
model (SHM) calculations is seen for antihyperons, since according to the PHSD analysis the antihyperons
should be modified by the same amount as antiprotons. As the PHSD results for particle ratios are
in line with the ALICE data (within error bars) this might point towards a deviation from statistical
equilibrium in the hadronization (at least for protons/antiprotons). Furthermore, we find that
the $B {\bar B} \leftrightarrow 3 M$ reactions are more effective at lower SPS energies where a net
suppression for antiprotons and antihyperons up to a factor of 2 -- 2.5 can be extracted from the PHSD
calculations for central Au+Au collisions.
