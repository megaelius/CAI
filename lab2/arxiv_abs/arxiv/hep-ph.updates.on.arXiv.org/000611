In the models with extended gauge symmetry, extra fields that couple to quarks and leptons are often
required to realize the realistic Yukawa couplings. For instance, some fields, in which Higgs $SU(2)_L$
doublets are embedded, are introduced to the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) and the realistic Yukawa
couplings consist of some Yukawa couplings between the SM fermions and the lightest mode among the
Higgs doubles. The GUT symmetry, in many cases, breaks down at the very high scale, and the Higgs doublets
survive up to the electroweak (EW) scale or some intermediate scales, as far as they do not gain masses
from the GUT symmetry breaking. In this paper, we discuss the multi-Higgs doublet models, that could
be effectively induced by the extended Standard Model (SM) where the SM fermions are unified. In
particular, we focus on the predictions in the supersymmetric left-right (LR) model, where the
down-type and the up-type Yukawa couplings are unified and the Yukawa couplings are expected to
be hermitian. Besides, the heavy Higgs doublets have flavor changing couplings with quarks and
leptons corresponding to the realization of the realistic fermion mass matrices. The LR symmetry
is assumed to break down at high energy, to realize the Type-I seesaw mechanism, and the EW symmetry
breaking is radiatively realized. In this case, the flavor-dependent interaction of the Higgs
fields is one promising prediction, so that we especially discuss the flavor physics induced by
the heavy Higgs fields in our work. Our prediction depends on the structure of neutrinos, e.g., the
neutrino mass ordering. We propose that our scenario could be proved by the $\mu \to 3 e$ process,
in one case where the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal.
