Extensions of the Standard Model are often highly constrained by cosmology. The presence of new
states can dramatically alter observed properties of the universe by the presence of additional
matter or entropy. In particular, attempts too solve the hierarchy problem through naturalness
invariably predict new particles near the weak scale which come into thermal equilibrium. Without
a means to deposit this energy into the SM, these models are often excluded. Scenarios of "neutral
naturalness" especially, such as the Twin Higgs frequently suffer from this. However, the Portalino,
a singlet fermion that marries gauge neutral fermion operators, can naturally help provide a portal
for entropy to return to the SM and to lift fermionic degrees of freedom in the Twin Sector. Together
with spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$ ${\rm SM \leftrightarrow {\rm Twin}}$ symmetry, there are
new opportunities to confront the cosmological challenges of these models. Here, we attempt to
develop such ideas. We shall show how one can lift many of the light fields by breaking $\ztwo$ with
a $U(1)_Y$ scalar and its Twin partner. The introduction of Portalinos can lift the remaining degrees
of freedom. We shall find that such models are highly constrained by precision SM measurements,
motivating moderate extensions beyond this. We will discuss two, one with additional weak matter
and another with additional colored matter. The weak model will involve simple two Higgs doublet
models on top of $\ztwo$ breaking. The strong model will involve the presence of new leptoquarks
and diquarks. We will discuss the implications for neutrino masses from radiative corrections
and possible colored signals even within these models of neutral naturalness, some of which might
appear at the LHC or future colliders.
