New physics in the neutrino sector might be necessary to address anomalies between different neutrino
oscillation experiments. Intriguingly, it also offers a possible solution to the discrepant cosmological
measurements of $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$. We show here that delaying the onset of neutrino free-streaming
until close to the epoch of matter-radiation equality can naturally accommodate a larger value
for the Hubble constant $H_0=72.3 \pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc and a lower value of the matter fluctuations
$\sigma_8=0.786\pm 0.020$, while not degrading the fit to the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
damping tail. We achieve this by introducing neutrino self-interactions in the presence of a non-vanishing
sum of neutrino masses. This strongly interacting neutrino cosmology prefers $N_{\rm eff} = 4.02
\pm 0.29$, which has interesting implications for particle model-building and neutrino oscillation
anomalies. We show that the absence of the neutrino free-streaming phase shift on the CMB can be compensated
by shifting the value of other cosmological parameters, hence providing an important caveat to
the detections made in the literature. Due to their impact on the evolution of the gravitational
potential at early times, self-interacting neutrinos and their subsequent decoupling leave a
rich structure on the matter power spectrum. In particular, we point out the existence of a novel
localized feature appearing on scales entering the horizon at the onset of neutrino free-streaming.
While the interacting neutrino cosmology provides a better global fit to current cosmological
data, we find that traditional Bayesian analyses penalize the model as compared to the standard
cosmological. Our analysis shows that it is possible to find radically different cosmological
models that nonetheless provide excellent fits to the data, hence providing an impetus to thoroughly
explore alternate cosmological scenarios.
