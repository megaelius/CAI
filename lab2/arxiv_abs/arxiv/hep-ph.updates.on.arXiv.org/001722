Supermassive black hole (SMBH) coalescences are ubiquitous in the history of the Universe and often
exhibit strong accretion activities and powerful jets. These SMBH mergers are also promising candidates
for future gravitational wave detectors such as Laser Space Inteferometric Antenna (LISA). In
this work, we consider neutrino counterpart emission originating from the jet-induced shocks.
The physical picture is that relativistic jets launched after the merger will push forward inside
the premerger disk wind material, and then they subsequently get collimated, leading to the formation
of internal shocks, collimation shocks, forward shocks and reverse shocks. Cosmic rays can be accelerated
in these sites and neutrinos are expected via the photomeson production process. We formulate the
jet structures and relevant interactions therein, and then evaluate neutrino emission from each
shock site. We find that month-to-year high-energy neutrino emission from the postmerger jet after
the gravitational wave event is detectable by IceCube-Gen2 within approximately five to ten years
of operation in optimistic cases where the cosmic-ray loading is sufficiently high and a mildly
super-Eddington accretion is achieved. We also estimate the contribution of SMBH mergers to the
diffuse neutrino intensity, and find that a significant fraction of the observed very high-energy
($E_\nu\gtrsim1$ PeV) IceCube neutrinos could originate from them in the optimistic cases. In
the future, such neutrino counterparts together with gravitational wave observations can be used
in a multimessenger approach to elucidate in greater detail the evolution and the physical mechanism
of SMBH mergers.
