The FCC at CERN, a proposed 100-km circular facility with several colliders in succession, culminates
with a 100 TeV proton-proton collider. It offers a vast new domain of exploration in particle physics,
with orders of magnitude advances in terms of Precision, Sensitivity and Energy. The implementation
plan foresees, as a first step, an Electroweak Factory electron-positron collider. This high luminosity
facility, operating between 90 and 365 GeV centre-of-mass energy, will study the heavy particles
of the Standard Model, Z, W, Higgs, and top with unprecedented accuracy. The Electroweak Factory
$e^+e^-$ collider constitutes a real challenge to the theory and to precision calculations, triggering
the need for the development of new mathematical methods and software tools. A first workshop in
2018 had focused on the first FCC-ee stage, the Tera-Z, and confronted the theoretical status of
precision Standard Model calculations on the Z-boson resonance to the experimental demands. The
second workshop in January 2019, which is reported here, extended the scope to the next stages, with
the production of W-bosons (FCC-ee-W), the Higgs boson (FCC-ee-H) and top quarks (FCC-ee-tt).
In particular, the theoretical precision in the determination of the crucial input parameters,
alpha_QED, alpha_QCD, M_W, m_t at the level of FCC-ee requirements is thoroughly discussed. The
requirements on Standard Model theory calculations were spelled out, so as to meet the demanding
accuracy of the FCC-ee experimental potential. The discussion of innovative methods and tools
for multi-loop calculations was deepened. Furthermore, phenomenological analyses beyond the
Standard Model were discussed, in particular the effective theory approaches.
