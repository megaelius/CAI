We consider Drell-Yan production $pp\to V^* X \to L X$ at small $q_T \ll Q$. Experimental measurements
require fiducial cuts on the leptonic state $L$, which introduce enhanced, linear power corrections
in $q_T/Q$. We show that they can be unambiguously predicted from factorization, and resummed to
the same order as the leading-power contribution. We thus obtain predictions for the fiducial $q_T$
spectrum to N3LL and next-to-leading-power in $q_T/Q$. Matching to full NNLO ($\alpha_s^2$),
we find that the linear power corrections are indeed the dominant ones, and the remaining fixed-order
corrections become almost negligible below $q_T \lesssim 40$ GeV. We also discuss the implications
for more complicated observables, and provide predictions for the fiducial $\phi^*$ spectrum
at N3LL+NNLO. We find excellent agreement with ATLAS and CMS measurements of $q_T$ and $\phi^*$.
We also consider the $p_T^\ell$ spectrum. We show that it develops leptonic power corrections in
$q_T/(Q - 2p_T^\ell)$, which diverge near the Jacobian peak $p_T^\ell \sim Q/2$ and must be kept
to all powers to obtain a meaningful result there. Doing so, we obtain for the first time an analytically
resummed result for the $p_T^\ell$ spectrum around the Jacobian peak at N3LL+NNLO. Our method is
based on performing a complete tensor decomposition for hadronic and leptonic tensors. In practice
this is equivalent to often-used recoil prescriptions, for which our results now provide rigorous,
formal justification. Our tensor decomposition yields nine Lorentz-scalar hadronic structure
functions, which directly map onto the commonly used angular coefficients, but also holds for arbitrary
leptonic final states. In particular, for suitably defined Born-projected leptons it still yields
a LO-like angular decomposition even when including QED final-state radiation. We also discuss
the application to $q_T$ subtractions.
