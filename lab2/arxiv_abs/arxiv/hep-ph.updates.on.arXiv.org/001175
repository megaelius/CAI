The FCC at CERN, a proposed 100-km circular facility with several colliders in succession, culminates
with a 100 TeV proton-proton collider. It offers a vast new domain of exploration in particle physics,
with orders of magnitude advances in terms of Precision, Sensitivity and Energy. The implementation
plan foresees, as a first step, an Electroweak Factory electron-positron collider. This high luminosity
facility, operating between 90 and 365 GeV centre-of-mass energy, will study the heavy particles
of the Standard Model, Z, W, Higgs, and top with unprecedented accuracy. The Electroweak Factory
$e^+e^-$ collider constitutes a real challenge to the theory and to precision calculations, triggering
the need for the development of new mathematical methods and software tools. A first workshop in
2018 had focused on the first FCC-ee stage, the Tera-Z, and confronted the theoretical status of
precision Standard Model calculations on the Z-boson resonance to the experimental demands. The
second workshop in January 2019, which is reported here, extended the scope to the next stages, with
the production of W-bosons (FCC-ee-W), the Higgs boson (FCC-ee-H) and top quarks (FCC-ee-tt).
In particular, the theoretical precision in the determination of the crucial input parameters,
alpha_QED, alpha_QCD, M_W, m_t at the level of FCC-ee requirements is thoroughly discussed. The
requirements on Standard Model theory calculations were spelled out, so as to meet the demanding
accuracy of the FCC-ee experimental potential. The discussion of innovative methods and tools
for multi-loop calculations was deepened. Furthermore, phenomenological analyses beyond the
Standard Model were discussed, in particular the effective theory approaches. The reports of 2018
and 2019 serve as white papers of the workshop results and subsequent developments.
