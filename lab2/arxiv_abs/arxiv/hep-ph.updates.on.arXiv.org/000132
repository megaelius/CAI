A second Higgs doublet arises naturally as a parity partner of the standard model (SM) Higgs, once
SM is extended to its left-right symmetric version (LRSM) to understand the origin of parity violation
in weak interactions as well as to accommodate small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The
flavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) effects in the minimal version of this model (LRSM), however,
push the second Higgs mass to more than 15 TeV making it inaccessible at the LHC. Furthermore since
the second Higgs mass is directly linked to the $W_R$ mass, discovery of a "low" mass $W_R$ ($M_{W_R}\leq
5-6$ TeV) at the LHC would require values for some Higgs self couplings larger than one. In this paper
we present an extension of LRSM by adding a vector-like $SU(2)_R$ quark doublet which weakens the
FCNH constraints allowing the second Higgs mass to be near or below TeV and a third neutral Higgs below
3 TeV for a $W_R$ mass below 5 TeV. It is then possible to search for these heavier Higgs bosons at the
LHC, without conflicting with FCNH constraints. A right handed $W_R$ mass in the few TeV range is
quite natural in this class of models without having to resort to large scalar coupling parameters.
The CKM mixings are intimately linked to the vector-like quark mixings with the known quarks, which
is the main reason why the constraints on the second Higgs mass is relaxed. We present a detailed theoretical
and phenomenological analysis of this extended LR model and point out some tests as well as its potential
for discovery of a second Higgs at the LHC. Two additional features of the model are: (i) a 5/3 charged
quark and (ii) a fermionic top partner with masses in the TeV range.
