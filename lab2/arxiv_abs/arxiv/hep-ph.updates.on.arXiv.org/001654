Experimental measurements collected by the BABAR, Belle, and LHCb experiments on different observables
associated with the semileptonic transition $b \to c \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$, indicate the existence
of disagreement respect with the Standard Model predictions. These so-called charged-current
$B$ meson anomalies include the eight years long-standing discrepancies on $R(D)$ and $R(D^\ast)$,
together with $R(J/\psi)$ and the polarizations $P_\tau(D^\ast)$ and $F_L(D^\ast)$ from $\bar{B}
\to D^\ast \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$. We analyse the charged scalar boson contributions to these anomalies
within the framework of two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with the most general Yukawa couplings to
quarks and leptons from the third generation, involving left-handed and right-handed (sterile)
neutrinos. Considering the most recent data from HFLAV world-average and Belle combination, the
upper limits ${\rm BR}(B_c^- \to \tau^- \bar{\nu}_{\tau}) < 30\%$ and $10\%$, and the inclusive
ratio $R(X_c)$, we perform a phenomenological study of the parameter space, by paying special attention
to the right-handed neutrino solutions. We also include the prospect measurements on $R(D^{(\ast)})$
that the Belle II experiment could achieve and explore the future implications to the charged scalar
boson scenario. Our results show that current experimental $b\rightarrow c \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$
data and Belle II projection favor the interpretation of a charged scalar boson interacting with
right-handed neutrinos. Lastly, we reexamine addressing the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies in the
context of the 2HDM of Type II. We show that with the current Belle combined data is possible to obtain
an available parameter space on the plane $(M_{H^{\pm}}, \tan\beta)$ for a simultaneous explanation
of the anomalies. Moreover, projections at the Belle II experiment suggest that the 2HDM of Type
II would be no longer disfavored.
