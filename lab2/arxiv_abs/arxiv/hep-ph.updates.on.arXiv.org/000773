We present a global fit to all data on the suppression of high energy jets and high energy hadrons in
the most central heavy ion collisions at the LHC for two different collision energies, within a hybrid
strong/weak coupling quenching model. Even though the measured suppression factors for hadrons
and jets differ significantly from one another and appear to asymptote to different values in the
high energy limit, we obtain a simultaneous description of all these data after constraining the
value of a single model parameter. We use our model to investigate the origin of the difference between
the observed suppression of jets and hadrons and relate it, quantitatively, to the observed modification
of the jet fragmentation function in jets that have been modified by passage through the medium produced
in heavy ion collisions. In particular, the observed increase in the fraction of hard fragments
in medium-modified jets, which indicates that jets with the fewest hardest fragments lose the least
energy, corresponds quantitatively to the observed difference between the suppression of hadrons
and jets. We argue that a harder fragmentation pattern for jets with a given energy after quenching
is a generic feature of any mechanism for the interaction between jets and the medium that they traverse
that yields a larger suppression for wider jets. We also compare the results of our global fit to LHC
data to measurements of the suppression of high energy hadrons in RHIC collisions, and find that
with its parameter chosen to fit the LHC data our model is inconsistent with the RHIC data at the $3\sigma$
level, suggesting that hard probes interact more strongly with the less hot quark-gluon plasma
produced at RHIC.
