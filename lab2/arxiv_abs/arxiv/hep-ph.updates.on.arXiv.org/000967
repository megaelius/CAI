Hot and dense quark matter with isospin and chiral imbalances is investigated in the framework of
the (3+1)-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model (NJL) in the large-$N_c$ limit ($N_c$ is the
number of quark colors). Its phase structure is considered in terms of baryon -- $\mu_B$, isospin
-- $\mu_I$ and chiral isospin -- $\mu_{I5}$ chemical potentials. It is shown in the paper that (i)
in the chiral limit there is a duality between chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) and charged pion condensation
(PC) phenomena. (ii) At the physical point, i.e. at nonzero bare quark mass $m_0$, and temperature
this duality relation is only approximate, although rather accurate. (iii) We have shown that the
chiral isospin chemical potential $\mu_{I5}$ in dense quark matter generates charged pion condensation
both at zero and nonzero $m_0$, and at $\mu_{I5}\ne 0$ this phase might be observed up to temperatures
as high as 100 MeV. (iv) Pseudo-critical temperature of the chiral crossover transition rises in
the NJL model with increasing $\mu_{I5}$. (v) It has been found an agreement between particular
sections of the phase diagram in the framework of NJL model and corresponding ones in lattice QCD
simulations. Two different plots from different lattice simulations that are completely independent
and are not connected at the first sight are in reality dual to each other, it means that lattice QCD
simulations support the hypothesis that in real quark matter there exists the (approximate) duality
between CSB and charged PC. Moreover, we can reverse the logic and we can predict the increase of pseudo-critical
temperature with chiral chemical potential, the much debated effect recently, just by the duality
notion, hence bolster confidence in this result (lattice QCD showed this feature for unphysically
large pion mass) and put it on the considerably more solid ground.
