A consistent nonperturbative approach (based on QFT) to neutral fermion creation (due to their
magnetic moments) in strong inhomogeneous magnetic fields is considered. It is demonstrated that
quantization in terms of neutral particles and antiparticles is possible in terms of the states
with well-defined spin polarization. Such states are localizable and can form wave packets in a
given asymptotic region. In this case, the problem can be technically reduced to the problem of charged-particle
creation by an electric step. In particular, the relation to the Schwinger method of an effective
action is established. As an example, we calculate neutral fermion creation from the vacuum by a
linearly growing magnetic field. We show that the total number and the vacuum-to-vacuum transition
probability of created pairs depend only on the gradient of the magnetic field, but not on its strength,
and this fact does not depend on the spacetime dimension. We show that the created flux aimed in one
of the directions is formed from fluxes of particles and antiparticles of equal intensity and with
the same magnetic moments parallel to the external field. In such a flux, particle and antiparticle
velocities that are perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic moment and flux direction are essentially
depressed. The creation of neutral fermions with anomalous magnetic moments leads to a smoothing
of the initial magnetic field, which in turn prevents appearance of superstrong constant magnetic
fields. Our estimations show that the vacuum instability with respect to the creation of neutrinos
and even neutrons in strong magnetic fields of the magnetars and fields generated during a supernova
explosion has to be taken into account in the astrophysics. In particular, it may be of significance
for dark matter studies.
