Possibility of using the polarized electron target (PET) for testing the neutrino nature is considered.
One assumes that the incoming electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) beam is the superposition of left chiral
states with right chiral ones. Consequently the non--vanishing transversal components of $\nu_e$
spin polarization may appear, both T-even and T-odd. $\nu_e$s are produced by the low energy monochromatic
(un)polarized emitter located at a near distance from the hypothetical detector which is able to
measure both the azimuthal angle and polar angle of the recoil electrons, and/or also the energy
of the outgoing electrons with a high resolution. A detection process is the elastic scattering
of $\nu_e$s (Dirac or Majorana) on the polarized electrons. Left chiral (LC) $\nu_e$s interact
mainly by the standard $V - A$ interaction, while right chiral (RC) ones participate only in the non-standard
$V + A$, scalar $S_R$, pseudoscalar $P_R$ and tensor $T_R$ interactions. We show that a distinction
between the Dirac and Majorana $\nu_e$s is possible both for the purely left chiral states and in
the case of left-right superposition. We analyze the various types of azimuthal asymmetries of
recoil electrons, the spectrum and the polar distribution of scattered electrons as tools for probing
the $\nu_e$ nature and the effects of time reversal violation in the leptonic processes. The basic
difference between the Dirac and Majorana $\nu_e$s arises from the absence of T and V interactions
in the Majorana scenario. Moreover, in the Majorana case the cross section contains the non-vanishing
interference between $V-A$ and $V+A$ interactions, proportional to the T-even longitudinal $\nu_e$
polarization. Our model-independent study is carried out for the flavor $\nu_e$ eigenstates in
the relativistic $\nu_e$ limit.
