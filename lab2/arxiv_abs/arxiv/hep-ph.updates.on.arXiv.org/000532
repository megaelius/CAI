Neutron stars (NSs) obtain kicks of typically several 100 km/s at birth. The gravitational tug-boat
mechanism can explain these kicks as consequences of asymmetric mass ejection during the supernova
(SN) explosion. Support for this hydrodynamic explanation is provided by observations of SN remnants
with associated NSs, which confirm the prediction that the bulk of the explosion ejecta, in particular
chemical elements between silicon and the iron group, are dominantly expelled in the hemisphere
opposite to the direction of the NS kick. Here, we present a large set of two- and three-dimensional
explosion simulations of electron-capture SNe, considering explosion energies between ~3x10^49
erg and ~1.6x10^50 erg. We find that the fast acceleration of the SN shock in the steep density gradient
delimiting the O-Ne-Mg core of the progenitor enables such a rapid expansion of neutrino-heated
matter that the growth of neutrino-driven convection freezes out quickly in a high-mode spherical
harmonics pattern. Since the corresponding momentum asymmetry of the ejecta is very small and the
gravitational acceleration by the fast-expanding ejecta abates rapidly, the NS kick velocities
are at most a few km/s. The extremely low core compactness of O-Ne-Mg-core progenitors therefore
favors hydrodynamic NS kicks much below the ~160 km/s measured for the Crab pulsar. This suggests
either that the Crab Nebula is not the remnant of an electron-capture SN, but of a low-mass iron-core
progenitor, or that the Crab pulsar was not accelerated by the gravitational tug-boat mechanism
but received its kick by a non-hydrodynamic mechanism such as, e.g., anisotropic neutrino emission.
