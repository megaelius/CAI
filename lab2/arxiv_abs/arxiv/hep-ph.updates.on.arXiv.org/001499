We present a generalization of the relativistic, finite-volume, three-particle quantization
condition for non-identical pions in isosymmetric QCD. The resulting formalism allows one to use
discrete finite-volume energies, determined using lattice QCD, to constrain scattering amplitudes
for all possible values of two- and three-pion isospin. As for the case of identical pions considered
previously, the result splits into two steps: The first defines a non-perturbative function with
roots equal to the allowed energies, $E_n(L)$, in a given cubic volume with side-length $L$. This
function depends on an intermediate three-body quantity, denoted $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{df},3}$,
which can thus be constrained from lattice QCD input. The second step is a set of integral equations
relating $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{df},3}$ to the physical scattering amplitude, $\mathcal M_3$.
Both of the key relations, $E_n(L) \leftrightarrow \mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{df},3}$ and $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{df},3}\leftrightarrow
\mathcal M_3$, are shown to be block-diagonal in the basis of definite three-pion isospin, $I_{\pi
\pi \pi}$, so that one in fact recovers four independent relations, corresponding to $I_{\pi \pi
\pi}=0,1,2,3$. We also provide the generalized threshold expansion of $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{df},3}$
for all channels, as well as parameterizations for all three-pion resonances present for $I_{\pi\pi\pi}=0$
and $I_{\pi\pi\pi}=1$. As an example of the utility of the generalized formalism, we present a toy
implementation of the quantization condition for $I_{\pi\pi\pi}=0$, focusing on the quantum
numbers of the $\omega$ and $h_1$ resonances.
