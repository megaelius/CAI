We present a lattice QCD study of charmonium resonances and bound states with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ and
$3^{--}$ near the open-charm threshold, taking into account their strong transitions to $\bar
DD$. Vector charmonia are the most abundant in the experimentally established charmonium spectrum,
while recently LHCb reported also the first discovery of a charmonium with likely spin three. The
$\bar DD$ scattering amplitudes for partial waves $l=1$ and $l=3$ are extracted on the lattice by
means of the L\"uscher formalism, using multiple volumes and inertial frames. Parameterizations
of the scattering amplitudes provide masses and widths of the resonances, as well as the masses of
bound states. CLS ensembles with 2+1 dynamical flavors of non-perturbatively $O(a)$ improved
Wilson quarks are employed with $m_\pi\simeq 280$ MeV, a single lattice spacing of $a\simeq0.086$
fm and two lattice spatial extents of $L=24$ and $32$. Two values of the charm quark mass are considered
to examine the influence of the position of the $\bar{D}D$ threshold on the hadron masses. For the
lighter charm quark mass we find the vector resonance $\psi(3770)$ with mass $m=3780(7)$ MeV and
coupling $g=16.0(^{+2.1}_{-0.2})$ (related to the width), both consistent with their experimental
values. The vector $\psi(2S)$ appears as a bound state with $m=3666(10)$ MeV. The charmonium resonance
with $J^{PC}=3^{--}$ is found at $m=3831(^{+10}_{-16})$ MeV, consistent with the $X(3842)$ recently
discovered by LHCb. At our heavier charm-quark mass the $\psi(2S)$ as well as the $\psi(3770)$ are
bound states and the $X(3842)$ remains a resonance. We stress that all quoted uncertainties are
only statistical, while lattice spacing effects and the approach to the physical point still need
to be explored. This study of conventional charmonia sets the stage for more challenging future
studies of unconventional charmonium-like states.
