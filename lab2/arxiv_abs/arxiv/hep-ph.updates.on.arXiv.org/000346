The energy-momentum tensor plays an important role in QCD thermodynamics. Its expectation value
contains information of the pressure and the energy density as its diagonal part. Further properties
like viscosity and specific heat can be extracted from its correlation function. Recently a new
method based on the gradient flow was introduced to calculate the energy-momentum tensor on the
lattice, and has been successfully applied to quenched QCD. In this paper, we apply the gradient
flow method to calculate the energy-momentum tensor in (2+1)-flavor QCD. As the first application
of the method with dynamical quarks, we study at a single but fine lattice spacing a=0.07 fm with heavy
u and d quarks ($m_\pi/m_\rho=0.63$) and approximately physical s quark. Performing simulations
on lattices with Nt=16 to 4, the temperature range of T=174-697 MeV is covered. We find that the results
of the pressure and the energy density by the gradient flow method are consistent with the previous
results using the T-integration method at T<280 MeV, while the results show disagreement at T>350
MeV (Nt<8), presumably due to the small-Nt lattice artifact of $O((aT)^2)=O(1/N_t^2)$. We also
apply the gradient flow method to evaluate the chiral condensate taking advantage of the gradient
flow method that renormalized quantities can be directly computed avoiding the difficulty of explicit
chiral violation with lattice quarks. We compute the renormalized chiral condensate in the MS-bar
scheme at renormalization scale $\mu=2$ GeV with a high precision to study the temperature dependence
of the chiral condensate and its disconnected susceptibility. Even with the Wilson-type quark
action, we obtain the chiral condensate and its disconnected susceptibility showing a clear signal
of pseudocritical temperature at T~190 MeV related to the chiral restoration crossover.
