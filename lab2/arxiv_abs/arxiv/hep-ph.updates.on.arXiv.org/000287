Lattice QCD results for the coefficient $c_2$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the pressure
show that this quantity raises with the temperature towards the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. On the
other hand, model approximations predict that when a vector repulsion, parametrized by $G_V$,
is present this coefficient reaches a maximum just after $T_c$ and then deviates from the lattice
predictions. Recently, this discrepancy has been used as a guide to constrain the (presently unknown)
value of $G_V$ within the framework of effective models at large-$N_c$ (LN). In the present investigation
we show that, due to finite $N_c$ effects, $c_2$ may also develop a maximum even when $G_V=0$ since
a vector repulsive term can be dynamically generated by exchange type of radiative corrections.
Here we apply the the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) method to the two flavor Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
model (at $G_V=0$) and compare the results with those furnished by lattice simulations an by the
LN approximation at $G_V=0$ and also at $G_V \ne 0$. The OPT numerical results for $c_2$ are impressively
accurate for $T \lesssim 1.2\, T_c$ but, as expected, predict that this quantity develops a maximum
at high-$T$. After identifying the mathematical origin of this extremum we argue that such a discrepant
behavior may naturally arise within these effective quark models (at $G_V=0$) whenever the first
$1/N_c$ corrections are taken into account. We then interpret this hypothesis as an indication
that beyond the large-$N_c$ limit the correct high temperature (perturbative) behavior of $c_2$
will be faithfully described by effective models only if they also mimic the asymptotic freedom
phenomenon.
