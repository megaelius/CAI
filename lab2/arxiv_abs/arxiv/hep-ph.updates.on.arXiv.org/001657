Nucleon-nucleon interactions, both bare and effective, play an important role in our understanding
of the non-perturbative strong interaction, as well as nuclear structure and reactions. In recent
years, tremendous efforts have been seen in the lattice QCD community to derive nucleon-nucleon
interactions from first principles. Because of the daunting computing resources needed, most
of such simulations were still performed with larger than physical light quark masses. In the present
work, employing the recently proposed covariant chiral effective field theory (ChEFT), we study
the light quark mass dependence of the nucleon-nucleon interaction extracted by the HALQCD group.
It is shown that the pion-full version of the ChEFT can describe the lattice QCD data with $m_\pi=469$
MeV and their experimental counterpart reasonably well, while the pion-less version can describe
the lattice QCD data with $m_\pi=672, 837, 1015, 1171$ MeV, for both the $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$
channels. The slightly better description of the single channel than the triplet channel indicates
that higher order studies are necessary for the latter. Our results confirmed previous studies
that the nucleon-nucleon interaction becomes more attractive for both the singlet and triplet
channels as the pion mass decreases towards its physical value. It is shown that the virtual bound
state in the $^1S_0$ channel remains virtual down to the chiral limit, while the deuteron only appears
for a pion mass smaller than about 400 MeV. It seems that proper chiral extrapolations of nucleon-nucleon
interaction are possible for pion masses smaller than 500 MeV, similar to the mesonic and one-baryon
sectors.
