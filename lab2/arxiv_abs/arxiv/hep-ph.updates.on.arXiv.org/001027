We study the implications for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^*\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and $\Lambda_b
\to \Lambda_c^*\pi^-$ $[\Lambda_c^*=\Lambda_c(2595)$ and $\Lambda_c(2625)]$ decays that
can be deduced from heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS). Identifying the odd parity $\Lambda_c(2595)$
and $\Lambda_c(2625)$ resonances as HQSS partners, with total angular momentum--parity $j_q^P=1^-$
for the light degrees of freedom, we find that the ratios $\Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda_c(2595)\pi^-)/\Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda_c(2625)\pi^-)$
and $\Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow \Lambda_c(2595) \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell)/ \Gamma(\Lambda_b\rightarrow\Lambda_c(2625)
\ell \bar{\nu}_\ell)$ agree, within errors, with the experimental values given in the Review of
Particle Physics. We discuss how future, and more precise, measurements of the above branching
fractions could be used to shed light into the inner HQSS structure of the narrow $\Lambda_c(2595)$
odd-parity resonance. Namely, we show that such studies would constrain the existence of a sizable
$j^P_q=0^-$ component in its wave-function, and/or of a two-pole pattern, in analogy to the case
of the similar $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance in the strange sector, as suggested by most of the approaches
that describe the $\Lambda_c(2595)$ as a hadron molecule. We also investigate the lepton flavor
universality ratios $R[\Lambda_c^*] = {\cal B}(\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^* \tau\,\bar\nu_\tau)/{\cal
B}(\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^* \mu\,\bar\nu_\mu)$, and discuss how $R[\Lambda_c(2595)]$ may
be affected by a new source of potentially large systematic errors if there are two $\Lambda_c(2595)$
poles.
