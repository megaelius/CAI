The current status of implementing Tsallis (nonextensive) statistics on high-energy physics
is briefly reviewed. The remarkably low freezeout-temperature, which apparently fails to reproduce
the first-principle lattice QCD thermodynamics and the measured particle ratios, etc. is discussed.
The present work suggests a novel interpretation for the so-called {\it "Tsallis-temperature"}.
It is proposed that the low Tsallis-temperature is due to incomplete implementation of Tsallis
algebra though exponential and logarithmic functions to the high-energy particle-production.
Substituting Tsallis algebra into grand-canonical partition-function of the hadron resonance
gas model seems not assuring full incorporation of nonextensivity or correlations in that model.
The statistics describing the phase-space volume, the number of states and the possible changes
in the elementary cells should be rather modified due to interacting correlated subsystems, of
which the phase-space is consisting. Alternatively, two asymptotic properties, each is associated
with a scaling function, are utilized to classify a generalized entropy for such a system with large
ensemble (produced particles) and strong correlations. Both scaling exponents define equivalence
classes for all interacting and noninteracting systems and unambiguously characterize any statistical
system in its thermodynamic limit. We conclude that the nature of lattice QCD simulations is apparently
extensive and accordingly the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is fully fulfilled. Furthermore, we
found that the ratios of various particle yields at extreme high and extreme low energies of RHIC-BES
is likely nonextensive but not necessarily of Tsallis type.
