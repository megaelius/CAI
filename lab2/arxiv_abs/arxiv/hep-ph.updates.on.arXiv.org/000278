The charged fermion masses of the three generations exhibit the two strong hierarchies m_3 >>
m_2 >> m_1. We assume that also neutrino masses satisfy m_{nu 3} > m_{nu 2} > m_{nu 1}
and derive the consequences of the hierarchical spectra on the fermionic mixing patterns. The quark
and lepton mixing matrices are built in a general framework with their matrix elements expressed
in terms of the four fermion mass ratios m_u/m_c, m_c/m_t, m_d/m_s, and m_s/m_b and m_e/m_mu, m_mu/m_tau,
m_{nu 1}/m_{nu 2}, and m_{nu 2}/m_{nu 3}, for the quark and lepton sector, respectively. In this
framework, we show that the resulting mixing matrices are consistent with data for both quarks and
leptons, despite the large leptonic mixing angles. The minimal assumption we take is the one of hierarchical
masses and minimal flavour symmetry breaking that strongly follows from phenomenology. No special
structure of the mass matrices has to be assumed that cannot be motivated by this minimal assumption.
This analysis allows us to predict the neutrino mass spectrum and set the mass of the lightest neutrino
well below 0.01 eV. The method also gives the 1 sigma allowed ranges for the leptonic mixing matrix
elements. Contrary to the common expectation, leptonic mixing angles are found to be determined
solely by the four leptonic mass ratios without any relation to symmetry considerations as commonly
used in flavor model building. Still, our formulae can be used to build up a flavor model that predicts
the observed hierarchies in the masses---the mixing follows then from the procedure which is developed
in this work.
