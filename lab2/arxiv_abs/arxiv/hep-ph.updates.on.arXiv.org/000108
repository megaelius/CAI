Two methods are developed to generate dark matter mass via the large Higgs self-coupling regime
of radiative symmetry breaking in an extension of the conformal Standard Model containing a singlet
scalar field with a Higgs portal interaction. In the first approach, the dark matter mass occurs
through a sequential process of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking followed by a conventional
Higgs mechanism for the scalar singlet, and can account for less than 13% of the cosmological dark
matter abundance. However, in the dynamical approach where the Higgs and scalar singlet masses
are generated simultaneously through radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, the scalar singlet
can achieve much higher levels of dark matter abundance. At one-loop level in the dynamical method,
the dark singlet mass $M_s$ prediction is relatively insensitive to its cosmological abundance;
$107 GeV<M_s<120 GeV$ mass predictions correspond to abundances in the range 10%--100%.
Because we are working in the large Higgs self-coupling regime, we estimate higher order contributions
and find a mass formula for the dark matter mass in the dynamical method. By using this mass formula,
we demonstrate that the one-loop dynamical-approach calculation over-estimates the dark matter
mass and abundance resulting in $83 GeV<M_s<96 GeV$ and 10%--26% abundance when higher order
contributions are included. The dynamical approach also predicts a small scalar-singlet self-coupling,
providing a natural explanation for the astrophysical observations that place upper bounds on
dark matter self-interaction. The predictions in both methods are within the detection region
of the next generation XENON experiment.
