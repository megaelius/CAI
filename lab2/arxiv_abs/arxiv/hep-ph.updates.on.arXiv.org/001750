We study the conformal window of asymptotically free gauge theories containing $N_f$ flavors of
fermion matter transforming to the vector and two-index representations of $SO(N),~SU(N)$ and
$Sp(2N)$ gauge groups. For $SO(N)$ we also consider the spinorial representation. We determine
the critical number of flavors $N_f^{\rm cr}$, corresponding to the lower end of the conformal window,
by using the conjectured critical condition on the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear at
an infra-red fixed point, $\gamma_{\bar{\psi}\psi,\,{\rm IR}}=1$ or equivalently $\gamma_{\bar{\psi}\psi,\,{\rm
IR}}(2-\gamma_{\bar{\psi}\psi,\,{\rm IR}})=1$. To compute $\gamma_{\bar{\psi}\psi,\,{\rm
IR}}$ we employ the scheme-independent (Banks-Zaks) conformal expansion at the $4$th order in
$\Delta_{N_f}$, where the expansion parameter is the distance from the onset of the loss of asymptotic
freedom, $\Delta_{N_f}=N_f^{\rm AF}-N_f$. To quantify the uncertainties in our analysis, which
potentially originate from nonperturbative effects, we propose two distinct approaches by assuming
the large order behavior of the conformal expansion separately, either convergent or divergent
asymptotic. In the former case, we take the difference in the Pad\'e approximants to the two definitions
of the critical condition, whereas in the latter case the truncation error associated with the singularity
in the Borel plane is taken into account. Our results are further compared to other analytical methods
as well as lattice results available in the literature. In particular, we find that $SU(2)$ with
six and $SU(3)$ with ten fundamental flavors are likely on the lower edge of the conformal window,
which are consistent with the recent lattice results. We also predict that $Sp(4)$ theories with
fundamental and antisymmetric fermions have the critical numbers of flavors, approximately ten
and five, respectively.
