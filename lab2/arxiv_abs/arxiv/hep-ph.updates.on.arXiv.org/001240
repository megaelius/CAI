The time evolution of the expanding Colorless Partonic Matter, created in Ultra-Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collisions and undergoing the confining phase transition towards a Hadronic Gas, is discussed
in the context of a unified model combining our Colorless QCD-MIT Bag Model with the boost invariant
Bjorken expansion. The Bjorken Equation in the case of a longitudinal expansion scenario of a non-ideal
relativistic medium in finite volume is solved using certain initial conditions $(\tau_i,T(\tau_i))$
and their effect is studied in detail. The evolution of the temperature as a function of the proper
time $T(\tau,V)$ is then obtained at different volumes. Different times characterising different
scales of the whole time evolution, like the time of the finite volume transition point $\tau_0(V)$,
the hadronic time $\tau_H(V)$ at which the hadronization is completed, the lifetime of the Colorless
Partonic Plasma $\Delta \tau_{CPP}(V)$ and the lifetime of the confining phase transition $\Delta
\tau_{PT}(V)$ are calculated and their finite size scaling properties are studied in detail. New
finite size scaling laws are derived. Also, the time evolution of some Thermal Response Functions
as the order parameter $\mathcal{H}(\tau,V)$, energy density $\epsilon(\tau,V)$, pressure
$\mathscr{P}(\tau,V)$ and the sound velocity $\mathscr{C}_{s}(\tau,V)$ are investigated and
studied in detail. We find that the time evolution of our system is really affected by the colorlessness
requirement and the initial conditions of the partonic matter: the closer the volume is to the thermodynamic
limit, the longer are the times and the lifetimes of the system. A detailed analysis of the temporal
decreasing, in negative power, of the energy density $\epsilon(\tau,V) \propto \tau^{-\theta}$
in each of the three stages of the Bjorken expansion is carried out.
