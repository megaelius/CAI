The relativistic corrections to the color-octet $J/\psi$ hadroproduction at the Tevatron and
LHC are calculated up to $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ in nonrelativistic QCD factorization frame. The short
distance coefficients are obtained by matching full QCD with NRQCD results for the partonic subprocess
$g+g\to J/\psi ({}^1S_0^{[8]},{}^3S_1^{[8]}, {}^3P_J^{[8]})+g$, $q+\bar{q}\to J/\psi ({}^1S_0^{[8]},{}^3S_1^{[8]},
{}^3P_J^{[8]})+g$ and $g+q({\bar{q}})\to J/\psi ({}^1S_0^{[8]},{}^3S_1^{[8]}, {}^3P_J^{[8]})+q({\bar{q}})$.
The short distance coefficient ratios of relativistic correction to leading order for color-octet
states ${^1}S_{0}^{[8]}$, ${^3}S_{1}^{[8]}$, and ${^3}P_{J}^{[8]}$ at large $p_T$ are approximately
-5/6, -11/6, and -31/30, respectively, for each subprocess, and it is 1/6 for color-singlet state
${^3}S_{1}^{[1]}$. If the higher order long distance matrix elements are estimated through velocity
scaling rule with adopting $v^2=0.23$ and the lower order long distance matrix elements are fixed,
the leading order cross sections of color-octet states are reduced by about a factor of $20\sim40%$
at large $p_T$ at both the Tevatron and the LHC. Comparing with QCD radiative corrections to color-octet
states, relativistic correction is ignored along with $p_T$ increasing. Using long distance matrix
elements extracted from the fit to $J/\psi$ production at the Tevatron, we can find the unpolarization
cross sections of $J/\psi$ production at the LHC taking into account both QCD and relativistic corrections
are changed by about $20\sim50%$ of that considering only QCD corrections. These results indicate
that relativistic corrections may play an important role in $J/\psi$ production at the Tevatron
and the LHC.
