We present our calculation of electromagnetic effects, induced by the spectator charge on Feynman-$x_F$
distributions of charged pions in peripheral $Pb+Pb$ collisions at CERN SPS energies, including
realistic initial space-time-momentum conditions for pion emission. The calculation is performed
in the framework of our simplified implementation of the fire-streak model, adopted to the production
of both $\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$ mesons. Isospin effects are included to take into account the asymmetry
in production of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ at high rapidity. A comparison to a simpler model from the literature
is made. We obtain a good description of the NA49 data on the $x_F$- and $p_T$-dependence of the ratio
of cross sections $\pi^+/\pi^-$. The experimental data favors short times ($0.5<\tau<2$~fm/$c$)
for fast pion creation in the local fire-streak rest frame. The possibility of the expansion of the
spectators is considered in our calculation, and its influence on the electromagnetic effect observed
for the $\pi^+/\pi^-$ ratio is discussed. In addition we discuss the relation between anisotropic
flow and the electromagnetic distortion of $\pi^+/\pi^-$ ratios, and study the influence of transverse
expansion of fire streaks as well as their vorticity on this distortion. In this latter study we find
that inclusion of rotation of fire streaks in our model gives a satisfactory description of the rapidity
dependence of pion directed flow. We conclude that {our implementation of the} fire-streak model,
which properly describes the centrality dependence of $\pi^-$ rapidity spectra at CERN SPS energies,
also provides a quantitative description of the electromagnetic effect on the $\pi^+/\pi^-$ ratio
as a function of $x_F$.
