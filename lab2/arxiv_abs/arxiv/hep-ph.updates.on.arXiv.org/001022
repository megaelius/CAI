We find an argument related to the existence of a Z_2-symmetry for the renormalization group flow
derived from the bare Yang-Mills Lagrangian, and show that the cancellation of the vacuum energy
may arise motivated both from the renormalization group flow solutions and the effective Yang-Mills
action. In the framework of the effective Savvidy's action, two Mirror minima are allowed, with
exactly equal and hold opposite sign energy densities. At the cosmological level, we explore the
stability of the electric and magnetic attractor solutions, both within and beyond the perturbation
theory, and find that thanks to these latter the cancellation between the electric and the magnetic
vacua components is achieved at macroscopic space and time separations. This implies the disappearance
of the conformal anomaly in the classical limit of an effective Yang-Mills theory. In this picture,
the tunneling probability from the Mirror vacua to the other vacua is exponentially suppressed
in the quantum non-thermal state --- similarly to what happens for electroweak instantonic tunneling
solutions. Specifically, we show that, in a dynamical Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) cosmological background, the Nielsen-Olsen argument --- on the instability of uniform
chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic Mirror vacua --- is subtly violated. The chromo-magnetic
and chromo-electric uniform vacua are unstable only at asymptotic times, when the attractor to
a zero energy density is already reached. The two vacua can safely decay into one anisotropic vacuum
that has zero energy-density. We also discover a new surprising pattern of solitonic and anti-solitonic
space-like solutions, which are sourced by the Yang-Mills dynamics in FLRW. We dub such non-perturbative
configurations, which are directly related to dynamical cancellation mechanism of the vacuum
energy, as {\it chronons}, or $\chi$-solutions.
