We construct a generalization of the JIMWLK Hamiltonian, going beyond the eikonal approximation,
which governs the high-energy evolution of the scattering between a dilute projectile and a dense
target with an arbitrary longitudinal extent (a nucleus, or a slice of quark-gluon plasma). Different
physical regimes refer to the ratio $L/\tau$ between the longitudinal size $L$ of the target and
the lifetime $\tau$ of the gluon fluctuations. When $L/\tau \ll 1$, meaning that the target can be
effectively treated as a shockwave, we recover the JIMWLK Hamiltonian, as expected. When $L/\tau
\gg 1$, meaning that the fluctuations live inside the target, the new Hamiltonian governs phenomena
like the transverse momentum broadening and the radiative energy loss, which accompany the propagation
of an energetic parton through a dense QCD medium. Using this Hamiltonian, we derive a non-linear
equation for the dipole amplitude (a generalization of the BK equation), which describes the high-energy
evolution of jet quenching. As compared to the original BK-JIMWLK evolution, the new evolution
is remarkably different: the plasma saturation momentum evolves much faster with increasing energy
(or decreasing Bjorken's $x$) than the corresponding scale for a shockwave (nucleus). This widely
opens the transverse phase-space for the evolution and implies the existence of large radiative
corrections, enhanced by the double logarithm $\ln^2(LT)$, with $T$ the temperature of the medium.
This confirms and explains from a physical perspective a recent result by Liou, Mueller, and Wu (
arXiv:1304.7677 ). The dominant corrections are smooth enough to be absorbed into a renormalization
of the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$. This renormalization is controlled by a linear equation
supplemented with a saturation boundary, which emerges via controlled approximations from the
generalized BK equation alluded to above.
