We study the impact of R-parity violating Supersymmetry (RPV SUSY) on the 125 GeV Higgs production
and decay modes at the LHC. We assume a heavy SUSY spectrum with multi-TeV squarks and SU(2) scalar
singlets as well as the decoupling limit in the SUSY Higgs sector. In this case the lightest CP-even
Higgs is SM-like when R-parity is conserved. In contrast, we show that when R-parity violating interactions
are added to the SUSY framework, significant deviations may occur in some production and decay channels
of the 125 GeV Higgs-like state. Indeed, we assume a single-flavor (mostly third generation) Bilinear
RPV (BRPV) interactions, which generate Higgs-sneutrino mixing, lepton-chargino mixing and
neutrino-neutralino mixing, and find that notable deviations of ${\cal O}(20-30\%)$ may be expected
in the Higgs signal strength observables in some channels, e.g., in $p p \to h \to \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+
\tau^-$. Moreover, we find that new and detectable signals associated with BRPV Higgs decays to
gauginos, $h\rightarrow\nu_{\tau}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}$ and $h\rightarrow\tau^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{\mp}$,
may also arise in this scenario. These decays yield a typical signature of $h \to \tau^\pm \ell^\mp
+ {{\not\!\! E_T}}$ ($\ell =e,\mu,\tau$) that can be much larger than in the SM, and may also be accompanied
by an ${\cal O}(20-30\%)$ enhancement in the di-photon signal $pp \to h \to \gamma \gamma$. We also
examine potential interesting signals of Trilinear R-parity violation (TRPV) interactions in
the production and decays of the Higgs-sneutrino BRPV mixed state (assuming it is the 125 GeV scalar)
and show that, in this case also, large deviations up to ${\cal O}(100\%)$ are expected in e.g., $p
p \to h \to \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-$, which are sensitive to the BRPV$\times$TRPV coupling product.
