In the paper, we present QCD predictions for $\eta_{c} + \gamma$ production at an electron-position
collider up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy without renormalization scale
ambiguities. The NNLO total cross-section for $e^{+}+e^{-}\to\gamma+\eta_{c}$ using the conventional
scale-setting approach has large renormalization scale ambiguities, usually estimated by choosing
the renormalization scale to be the $e^+ e^-$ center-of-mass collision energy $\sqrt{s}$. The
Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) provides a systematic way to eliminate such renormalization
scale ambiguities by summing the nonconformal $\beta$ contributions into the QCD coupling $\alpha_s(Q^2)$.
The renormalization group equation then sets the value of $\alpha_s$ for the process. The PMC renormalization
scale reflects the virtuality of the underlying process, and the resulting predictions satisfy
all of the requirements of renormalization group invariance, including renormalization scheme
invariance. After applying the PMC, we obtain a scale-and-scheme independent prediction, $\sigma|_{\rm
NNLO, PMC}\simeq 41.18$ fb for $\sqrt{s}$=10.6 GeV. The resulting pQCD series matches the series
for conformal theory and thus has no divergent renormalon contributions. The large $K$ factor which
contributes to this process reinforces the importance of uncalculated NNNLO and higher-order
terms. Using the PMC scale-and-scheme independent conformal series and the $\rm Pad\acute{e}$
approximation approach, we predict $\sigma|_{\rm NNNLO, PMC+Pade} \simeq 21.36$ fb, which is
consistent with the recent BELLE measurement $\sigma^{\rm obs}$=$16.58^{+10.51}_{-9.93}$
fb at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 10.6$ GeV. This procedure also provides a first estimate of the NNNLO contribution.
