In this paper we focus on the Earth matter effects for the solar parameter determination by a medium
baseline reactor experiment such as JUNO. We derive perturbative expansions for the mixing angles
$\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{13}$ as well as the $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$ in terms
of the matter potential relevant for JUNO. These expansions, up to second order in the matter potential,
while simple, allow one to calculate the electron antineutrino survival probability to a precision
much better than needed for the JUNO experiment. We use these perturbative expansions to semi-analytically
explain and confirm the shift caused by the matter effects on the solar neutrino mixing parameters
$\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ which were previously obtained by a purely numerical $\chi^2$
analysis. Since these shifts do not satisfy the naive expectations and are significant given the
precision that can be achieved by the JUNO experiment, a totally independent cross check using a
completely different method is of particular importance. We find that these matter effect shifts
do not depend on any of the details of the detector characteristics apart from the baseline and earth
mass density between reactor(s) and detector, but do depend on the normalized product of reactor
neutrino spectrum times the inverse-beta decay cross-section. The results of this manuscript
suggests an alternative analysis method for measuring $\sin^2 \theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$
in JUNO which would be a useful cross check of the standard analysis and for the understanding of the
Wolfenstein matter effect. The explanation of these shifts together with a quantitative understanding,
using a semi-analytical method, is the principal purpose of this paper.
