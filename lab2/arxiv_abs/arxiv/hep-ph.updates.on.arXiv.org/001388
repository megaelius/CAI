In this letter, we elaborate further on a Cosmological "Running-Vacuum" type model for the Universe,
suggested previously by the authors within the context of a string-inspired effective theory in
the presence of a Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravitational axion field which descends from the antisymmetric
tensor of the massless gravitational string multiplet. In the presence of this field, which has
anomalous CP violating interactions with the gravitons, primordial gravitational waves induce
gravitational anomalies, which in turn are responsible for the appearance of $H^2$ and $H^4$ contributions
to the vacuum energy density, these terms being characteristic of generic "running-vacuum-model
(RVM) type", where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. In this work we prove in detail the appearance of the
$H^4$ terms due to gravitational-anomaly-induced condensates in the energy density of the primordial
Universe, which can self-consistently induce inflation, and subsequent exit from it, according
to the generic features of RVM. We also argue in favour of the robustness of our results, which were
derived within an effective low-energy field theory approach, against Ultra Violet completion
of the theory. During the radiation and matter-dominated eras, gravitational anomalies cancel,
as required for the consistency of the quantum matter/radiation field theory. However, chiral
and QCD-axion-type anomalies survive and have important consequences for both cosmic magnetogenesis
and axionic dark matter in the Universe. Finally, the stringy RVM scenario presented here predicts
quintessence-like dynamical dark energy for the current Universe, which is compatible with the
existing fitting analyses of such model against observations
