Upcoming experimental programs will look for signatures of a possible critical point in the QCD
phase diagram in fluctuation observables. To understand and predict these signatures, one must
account for the fact that the dynamics of any critical fluctuations must be out-of-equilibrium:
because of critical slowing down, the fluctuations cannot stay in equilibrium as the droplet of
QGP produced in a collision expands and cools. Furthermore, their out-of-equilibrium dynamics
must also influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the cooling droplet. The recently developed
Hydro+ formalism allows for a consistent description of both the hydrodynamics and the out-of-equilibrium
fluctuations, including the feedback between them. We shall explicitly demonstrate how this works,
setting up a Hydro+ simulation in a simplified setting: a rapidity-independent fireball undergoing
radial flow with an equation of state in which we imagine a critical point close to the $\mu_B=0$ axis
of the phase diagram. Within this setup, we show that we can quantitatively capture non-equilibrium
phenomena, including critical fluctuations over a range of scales and memory effects. Furthermore,
we illustrate the interplay between the dynamics of the fluctuations and the hydrodynamic flow
of the fireball: as the fluid cools and flows, the dynamical fluctuations lag relative to how they
would evolve if they stayed in equilibrium; there is then a backreaction on the flow itself due to
the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations; and, in addition, the radial flow transports fluctuations
outwards by advection. Within our model, we find that the backreaction from the out-of-equilibrium
fluctuations does not yield dramatically large effects in the hydrodynamic variables. Further
work will be needed in order to check this quantitative conclusion in other settings but, if it persists,
this will considerably simplify future modelling.
