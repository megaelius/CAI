The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment (KATRIN) aims at a measurement of the neutrino mass with
a 90 %-C.L. sensitivity of 0.2 eV/c$^2$ by measuring the endpoint region of the tritium $\beta$-decay
spectrum. As a large-scale experiment with a sharp energy resolution and high source strength,
KATRIN is also potentially sensitive to keV-scale sterile neutrinos, which are promising dark
matter candidates. The mixing between active and sterile neutrinos would lead to a second spectral
component with a weak relative intensity of order $\sin^2\theta \lesssim 10^{-6}$ , which requires
additional experimental strategies to extract this small signature from the data and to eliminate
systematics. A possible strategy is to run the experiment in an alternative time-of-flight (TOF)
mode which would provide differential TOF spectra of the $\beta$-decay electrons in contrast to
the integrated spectrum given by the standard mode of operation. In this publication, the sensitivity
of a TOF mode to keV-scale sterile neutrinos has been investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. In
order to estimate the sensitivity from a reduced sample size, a new analysis method, called self-consistent
approximate Monte Carlo (SCAMC) has been developed and used. The simulations show that an ideal
TOF mode would be able to achieve a statistical sensitivity of $\sin^2\theta \sim 5 \times 10^{-9}$
at one $\sigma$, which is about a factor two improvement compared to the standard integral mode.
This relative benefit grows significantly stronger if additional exemplary systematics are considered.
A possible implementation of the TOF mode with existing hardware, called gated filtering, is investigated,
which, however, comes at the price of a reduced average signal rate.
