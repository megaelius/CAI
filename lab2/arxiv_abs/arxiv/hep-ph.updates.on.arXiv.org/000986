In this paper we show that the interaction between new light dark matter mediators and the SM particles
can be naturally suppressed if one employs a single, flat extra dimension (ED). In this setup, the
SM fields are localized in a finite width `fat' brane, similar to models of Universal Extra Dimensions
(UED), while DM, in turn, is confined to a thin brane at the opposite end of the ED interval. Including
brane localized kinetic terms on the fat brane for the mediator fields, the resulting coupling between
the SM and these light mediators can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding
ones between the mediators and DM which we assume to be a typical gauge coupling. We investigate the
implications of this scenario for both vector (i.e., dark photon, DP) and scalar mediator fields
in the 5-D bulk. In this setup kinetic mixing, which is usually employed to suppress light mediator
couplings, is not required. Here we assume that the SM particles couple to the DP via their $B-L$ charges
while the DP couples to the DM via a dark charge. Both the vector DP couplings and the corresponding
Higgs portal couplings with the SM are shown to be natural small in magnitude with a size dependent
on ratio of the 5-D compactification radius, $R^{-1} \sim 0.1-1$ GeV, and the SM brane thickness,
$L^{-1} \sim 2-10$ TeV, a range chosen to avoid LHC and other experimental constraints. In this framework
one can obtain the observed value of the DM relic abundance for a wide range of parameter choices,
while the constrains due to direct DM detection and the invisible width of the Higgs do not impose
significant challenges to the model. Finally, this mechanism can lead to distinct signatures in
both present and upcoming experiments as it combines some common features of UED and DP models in
a single ED setup.
