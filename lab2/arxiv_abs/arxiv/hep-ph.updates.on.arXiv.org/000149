The Higgs not only induces the masses of all SM particles, the Higgs, given its special mass value,
is the natural candidate for the inflaton and in fact is ruling the evolution of the early universe,
by providing the necessary dark energy which remains the dominant energy density. SM running couplings
not only allow us to extrapolate SM physics up to the Planck scale, but equally important they are
triggering the Higgs mechanism. This is possible by the fact that the bare mass term in the Higgs potential
changes sign at about mu_0 = 1.4x10^16 GeV and in the symmetric phase is enhanced by quadratic terms
in the Planck mass. Such a huge Higgs mass term is able to play a key role in triggering inflation in
the early universe. In this article we extend our previous investigation by working out the details
of a Higgs inflation scenario. We show how different terms contributing to the Higgs Lagrangian
are affecting inflation. Given the SM and its extrapolation to scales mu>mu_0 we find a calculable
cosmological constant V(0) which is weakly scale dependent and actually remains large during inflation.
This is different to the Higgs fluctuation field dependent Delta V(phi), which decays exponentially
during inflation, and actually would not provide a sufficient amount of inflation. The fluctuation
field has a different effective mass which shifts the bare Higgs transition point to a lower value
mu'_0 = 7.7x10^14 GeV. The vacuum energy V(0) being proportional to M_Pl^4 has a coefficient which
vanishes near the Higgs transition point, such that the bare and the renormalized cosmological
constant match at this point. The role of the Higgs in reheating and baryogenesis is emphasized.
