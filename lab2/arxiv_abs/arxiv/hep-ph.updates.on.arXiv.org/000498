An intriguing possibility for the dark sector of our universe is that the dark matter particle could
interact with a dark radiation component. If the non-gravitational interactions of the dark matter
and dark radiation species with Standard Model particles are highly suppressed, then astrophysics
and cosmology could be our only windows into probing the dynamics of such a dark sector. It is well
known that such dark sectors would lead to suppression of small scale structure, which would be constrained
by measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. In this work we consider the cosmological signatures
of such dark sectors on the reionization history of our universe. Working within the "ETHOS" (effective
theory of structure formation) framework, we show that if such a dark sector exists in our universe,
the suppression of low mass dark matter halos would also reduce the total number of ionizing photons,
thus affecting the reionization history of our universe. We place constraints on the interaction
strengths within such dark sectors by using the measured value of the optical depth from the Planck
satellite, as well as from demanding a successful reionization history. We compare and contrast
such scenarios with warm dark matter scenarios which also suppress structure formation on small
scales. In a model where dark matter interacts with a sterile neutrino, we find a bound on the ETHOS
parameter $a_4\lesssim 1.2\times10^6\textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$. For warm dark matter models, we constrain
the mass $m_{\textrm{WDM}}\gtrsim 0.7\textrm{ keV}$, which is comparable to bounds obtained
from Lyman-$\alpha$ measurements. Future 21-cm experiments will measure the global history of
reionization and the neutral hydrogen power spectrum, which could either lead to stronger constraints
or discovery of secret dark sector interactions.
