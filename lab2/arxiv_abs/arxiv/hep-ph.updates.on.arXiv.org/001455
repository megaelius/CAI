The spectroscopic parameters and decay channels of the axial-vector tetraquark $T_{bb;\overline{u}\overline{s}}^{-}$
(in what follows $T_{b: \overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$) are explored by means of the QCD sum rule
method. The mass and coupling of this state are calculated using the two-point sum rules by taking
into account various vacuum condensates up to dimension 10. Our prediction for the mass of this state
$m=(10215\pm 250)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ confirms that it is stable against strong and electromagnetic
decays, and can dissociate to conventional mesons only through weak transformations. We investigate
the dominant semileptonic $T_{b:\overline{s} }^{\mathrm{AV}} \to \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}l\overline{\nu}_l$
and nonleptonic $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}} \to \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s} }^{0}M$
decays of $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$. In these processes the $\mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}$
is a scalar tetraquark $[bc][\overline{u} \overline{s}]$ built of a color-triplet diquark and
antidiquark, whereas $M$ is one of the vector mesons $\rho ^{-}$, $K^{\ast}(892)$, $D^{\ast }(2010)^{-}$,
and $D_{s}^{\ast -}$. In order to calculate partial widths of these decays, we make use of the QCD
three-point sum rule approach and evaluate weak transition form factors $G_{i}$, $i=0.1,2,3$,
which govern these processes. The full width $\Gamma_{\mathrm{full}} =(12.9\pm 2.1)\times 10^{-8}~\mathrm{MeV}$,
and mean lifetime $ \tau=5.1_{-0.71}^{+0.99}~\mathrm{fs}$ of the tetraquark $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{
\mathrm{AV}}$ are computed using aforementioned weak decays. Obtained information on parameters
of $T_{b:\overline{s}}^{\mathrm{AV}}$ and $ \mathcal{Z}_{b:\overline{s}}^{0}$ is useful
for experimental investigations of these double-heavy exotic mesons.
