We estimate the effect of the spectator-induced electromagnetic interaction on the directed flow
of charged pions. For intermediate centrality Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$~GeV,
we demonstrate that the electromagnetic interaction between spectator charges and final state
pions results in charge splitting of positive and negative pion directed flow. Such a charge splitting
is visible in the experimental data reported by the STAR Collaboration. The magnitude of this charge
splitting appears to strongly depend on the actual distance between the pion emission site (pion
at freeze-out) and the spectator system. As such, the above electromagnetic effect brings new,
independent information on the space-time evolution of pion production in heavy ion collisions.
From the comparison of our present analysis to our earlier studies made for pions produced at higher
rapidity, we formulate conclusions on the rapidity dependence of the distance between the pion
emission site and the spectator system. This distance appears to decrease with increasing pion
rapidity, reflecting the longitudinal expansion of the strongly-interacting system responsible
for pion emission. Thus for the first time, information on the space-time characteristics of the
system is being provided by means of the spectator-induced electromagnetic interaction. The above
electromagnetic effect being in fact a straight-forward consequence of the presence of spectator
charges in the collision, we consider that it should be considered as a baseline for studies of other
phenomena, like those related to the electric conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma.
