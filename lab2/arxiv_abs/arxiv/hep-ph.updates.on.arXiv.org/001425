While LHC has discovered a very Standard Model-like Higgs boson of mass m_h~ 125 GeV, no solid signal
for physics beyond the Standard Model has emerged so far at LHC or at WIMP seach experiments. For the
case of weak scale supersymmetry (SUSY), LHC has found rather generally that gluinos are beyond
about 2.2 TeV whilst top squark must lie beyond 1.1 TeV. These limits contradict older simplistic
notions of naturalness that emerged in the 1980s-1990s, leading to the rather pessimistic view
that SUSY is now excluded except for perhaps some remaining narrow corners of parameter space. Yet,
this picture ignores several important developments in SUSY/string theory that emerged in the
21st century: 1. the emergence of the string theory landscape and its solution to the cosmological
constant problem, 2. a more nuanced view of naturalness including the notion of ``stringy naturalness'',
3. the emergence of anomaly-free discrete R-symmetries and their connection to R-parity, Peccei-Quinn
symmetry, the SUSY mu problem and proton decay and 4. the importance of including a solution to the
strong CP problem. Rather general considerations from the string theory landscape favor large
values of soft terms, subject to the vacuum selection criteria that electroweak symmetry is properly
broken (no CCB minima) and the resulting magnitude of the weak scale is not too far from our measured
value. Then stringy naturalness predicts a Higgs mass m_h~ 125 GeV whilst sparticle masses are typically
lifted beyond present LHC bounds. In light of these refinements in theory perspective confronted
by LHC and dark matter search results, we review the most likely LHC, ILC and dark matter signatures
that are expected to arise from weak scale SUSY as we understand it today.
