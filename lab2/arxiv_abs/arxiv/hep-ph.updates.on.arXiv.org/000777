We put forward an alternative way for estimations of the deconfinement temperature in bottom-up
holographic models. The deconfinement in AdS/QCD is related to the Hawking-Page phase transition,
in which the critical Hawking temperature is identified with the deconfinement one in the gauge
theory. The numeric estimation of the latter is only possible when the parameters of a $5D$ dual model
are previously determined from a consistency with other physical aspects, standardly, providing
description of the QCD resonances. The traditional way of fixation of parameters in simplest AdS/QCD
models is to reproduce the mass of the $\rho$ meson or the slope of the approximate radial Regge trajectory
of the $\rho$ excitations. Motivated by a general idea that the slope value originates in gluodynamics,
we propose to calculate the deconfinement temperature using the trajectory of scalar glueballs.
We consider several holographic models and use the recent idea of isospectral potentials to make
an additional check of the relevance of our approach. It is demonstrated that different models from
an isospectral family (i.e. the models leading to identical predictions for spectrum of hadrons
with fixed quantum numbers) result in different predictions for the deconfinement temperature.
This difference is found to be quite small in the scalar glueball channel but very large in the vector
one. The observed stability in the former case clearly favours the choice of the glueball channel
for thermodynamic predictions in AdS/QCD models. As a balanced approach we argue that either assuming
$f_0(1500)$ to have a dominating component of $0^{++}$ glueball or accepting the idea of the universality
in the radial Regge trajectories of light non-strange vector mesons, one can reproduce the results
for the deconfinement temperature obtained before in the lattice simulations in the background
of non-dynamical quarks.
