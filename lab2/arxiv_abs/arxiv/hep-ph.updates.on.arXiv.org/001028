The past seventeen years have witnessed tremendous progress on the experimental and theoretical
explorations of the multiquark states. The hidden-charm and hidden-bottom multiquark systems
were reviewed extensively in [Phys. Rept. 639 (2016) 1-121]. In this article, we shall update the
experimental and theoretical efforts on the hidden heavy flavor multiquark systems in the past
three years. Especially the LHCb collaboration not only confirmed the existence of the hidden-charm
pentaquarks but also provided strong evidence of the molecular picture. Besides the well-known
$XYZ$ and $P_c$ states, we shall discuss more interesting tetraquark and pentaquark systems either
with one, two, three or even four heavy quarks. Some very intriguing states include the fully heavy
exotic tetraquark states $XYZ$ $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ and doubly heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar q \bar
q$, where $Q$ is a heavy quark. The $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ states may be produced at LHC while the $QQ\bar
q \bar q$ system may be searched for at BelleII and LHCb. Moreover, we shall pay special attention
to various theoretical schemes. We shall emphasize the model-independent predictions of various
models which are truly/closely related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). There have also accumulated
many lattice QCD simulations through multiple channel scattering on the lattice in recent years,
which provide deep insights into the underlying structure/dynamics of the $XYZ$ states. In terms
of the recent $P_c$ states, the lattice simulations of the charmed baryon and anti-charmed meson
scattering are badly needed. We shall also discuss some important states which may be searched for
at BESIII, BelleII and LHCb in the coming years.
