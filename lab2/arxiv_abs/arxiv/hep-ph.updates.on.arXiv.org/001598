We explore the possibility of observing odderon exchange in the $pp \to pp K^{+}K^{-}$ and $pp \to
pp \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ reactions at the LHC. We consider the central exclusive production (CEP) of
the $\phi(1020)$ resonance decaying into $K^{+} K^{-}$ and $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. We compare the purely
diffractive contribution (odderon-pomeron fusion) to the photoproduction contribution (photon-pomeron
fusion). The theoretical results are calculated within the tensor-pomeron and vector-odderon
model for soft reactions. We include absorptive corrections at the amplitude level. In order to
fix the coupling constants for the photon-pomeron fusion contribution we discuss the reactions
$\gamma p \to \omega p$ and $\gamma p \to \phi p$ including $\phi$-$\omega$ mixing. We compare our
results for these reactions with the available data, especially those from HERA. Our coupling constants
for the pomeron-odderon-$\phi$ vertex are taken from an analysis of the WA102 data for the $p p \to
p p \phi$ reaction. We show that the odderon-exchange contribution significantly improves the
description of the $pp$ azimuthal correlations and the $dP_{t}$ "glueball-filter variable" dependence
of $\phi$ CEP measured by WA102. To describe the low-energy data more accurately we consider also
subleading processes with reggeized vector-meson exchanges. However, they do not play a significant
role at the LHC. We present predictions for two possible types of measurements: at midrapidity and
with forward measurement of protons (relevant for ATLAS-ALFA or CMS-TOTEM), and at forward rapidities
and without measurement of protons (relevant for LHCb). We discuss the influence of experimental
cuts on the integrated cross sections and on various differential distributions. With the corresponding
LHC data one should be able to get a decisive answer concerning the presence of an odderon-pomeron
fusion contribution in single $\phi$ CEP.
