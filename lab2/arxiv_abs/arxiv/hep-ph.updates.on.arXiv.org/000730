I study the "general" case that arises in the Extended Effective Field Theory of Inflation (gEEFToI),
in which the coefficients of the sixth order polynomial dispersion relation depend on the physical
wavelength of the fluctuation mode, hence they are time-dependent. At arbitrarily short wavelengths
the unitarity is lost for each mode. Depending on the values of the gEEFToI parameters in the unitary
gauge action, two scenarios can arise: in one, the coefficients of the polynomial become singular,
flip signs at some physical wavelength and asymptote to a constant value as the wavelength of the
mode is stretched to infinity. Starting from the WKB vacuum, the two-point function is essentially
singular in the infinite IR limit. In the other case, the coefficients of the dispersion relation
evolve monotonically from zero to a constant value in the infinite IR. In order to have a finite power
spectrum starting from the vacuum in this case, the mode function has to be an eigensolution of the
Confluent Heun (CH) equation, which leads to a very confined parameter space for gEEFToI. Finally,
I look at a solution of the CH equation which is regular in the infinite IR limit and yields a finite
power spectrum in either scenario. I demonstrate that this solution asymptotes to an excited state
in past infinity in both cases. The result is interpreted in the light of the loss of unitarity for
very small wavelengths. The outcome of such a non-unitary phase evolution should prepare each mode
in the excited initial state that yields a finite two-point function for all the parameter space.
This will be constraining of the new physics that UV completes such scenarios.
