Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping traces the large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe
and therefore should correlate with the gamma-ray emission originated from particle dark matter
annihilation or from active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies, since the related processes
occur in the same cosmic structures hosting HI. In this paper, we derive the cross-correlation signal
between the brightness temperature of the 21-cm line emission of the HI spin-flip transition in
the Universe and the unresolved gamma-ray background. Specifically, we derive forecasts for the
cross-correlation signal by focussing on the opportunities offered by the combination of the Fermi-Large
Area Telescope (LAT) gamma-ray sensitivity with the expectations of the HI intensity mapping measurements
from future radio telescopes, for which we concentrate on the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and MeerKAT,
one of its precursors. We find that the combination of MeerKAT with the current Fermi-LAT statistics
has the potential to provide a first hint of the cross-correlation signal originated by astrophysical
sources, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3.7. With SKA Phase 1 and SKA Phase 2, the SNR is predicted
to increase up to 5.7 and 8.2, respectively. The bounds on dark matter properties attainable with
SKA combined with the current statistics of Fermi-LAT are predicted to be comparable to those obtained
from other techniques able to explore the unresolved components of the gamma-ray background. The
enhanced capabilities of SKA Phase 2, combined with a future generation gamma-ray telescope with
improved specifications, can allow us to investigate the whole mass window for weakly interacting
massive particles up to the TeV scale.
