Criticality of chiral phase transition at finite temperature is investigated in a soft-wall AdS/QCD
model with $SU_L(N_f)\times SU_R(N_f)$ symmetry, especially for $N_f=2,3$ and $N_f=2+1$. It
is shown that in quark mass plane($m_{u/d}-m_s$) chiral phase transition is second order at a certain
critical line, by which the whole plane is divided into first order and crossover regions. The critical
exponents $\beta$ and $\delta$, describing critical behavior of chiral condensate along temperature
axis and light quark mass axis, are extracted both numerically and analytically. The model gives
the critical exponents of the values $\beta=\frac{1}{2}, \delta=3$ and $\beta=\frac{1}{3},
\delta=3$ for $N_f=2$ and $N_f=3$ respectively. For $N_f=2+1$, in small strange quark mass($m_s$)
region, the phase transitions for strange quark and $u/d$ quarks are strongly coupled, and the critical
exponents are $\beta=\frac{1}{3},\delta=3$; when $m_s$ is larger than $m_{s,t}=0.290\rm{GeV}$,
the dynamics of light flavors($u,d$) and strange quarks decoupled and the critical exponents for
$\bar{u}u$ and $\bar{d}d$ becomes $\beta=\frac{1}{2},\delta=3$, exactly the same as $N_f=2$
result and the mean field result of 3D Ising model; between the two segments, there is a tri-critical
point at $m_{s,t}=0.290\rm{GeV}$, at which $\beta=0.250,\delta=4.975$. In some sense, the current
results is still at mean field level, and we also showed the possibility to go beyond mean field approximation
by including the higher power of scalar potential and the temperature dependence of dilaton field,
which might be reasonable in a full back-reaction model. The current study might also provide reasonable
constraints on constructing a realistic holographic QCD model, which could describe both chiral
dynamics and glue-dynamics correctly.
