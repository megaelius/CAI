We analyze the $\tau^-\to(K\pi)^-\nu_\tau$ decays within an effective field theory description
of heavy new physics (NP) modifying the SM left-handed weak charged current and include refined
SM input for the participant meson form factors exploiting chiral symmetry, dispersion relations
and (lattice) data. We include the leading dimension six operators and work at linear order in the
effective couplings. Within this setting we: i) follow the derivation in Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 (2018)
no.14, 141803 where it was proved unambiguously that it is impossible to understand the BaBar anomaly
in the CP asymmetry measurement within this framework. We allow for reasonable variations of the
hadronic input involved and study the associated uncertainty; ii) first show that the anomalous
bump present in the published Belle data for the $K_S\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution close to
threshold cannot be due to heavy NP; iii) first bind the heavy NP effective couplings using $\tau^-\to(K\pi)^-\nu_\tau$
decays and show that they are competitive with those found in hyperon semileptonic decays (but clearly
not with those obtained in Kaon (semi)leptonic decays for NP scalar currents). We put forward that
the comparison of the considered tau decays with (semi)leptonic kaon and hyperon decays provide
with meaningful tests of lepton universality for (NP) tensor interactions. We also compare the
SM predictions with the possible deviations caused by NP in a couple of Dalitz plot distributions,
in the forward-backward asymmetry and in the di-meson invariant mass distribution and discuss
the most interesting measurements to be performed at Belle-II using these decays data.
