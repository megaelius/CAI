\begin{abstract} It is usually assumed that the difficulties arising from the indistinguishability
of the two electrons in the triplet produced by photons of high energy in the field of an electron may
be avoided simply by ruling out the contributions of all the Feynmann diagrams as well as the Borsellino.
In this way, the question of indistinguishability becomes meaningless, there is a clear distinction
between the recoil electron and the pair electron; and it is well-known that the entire mechanism
works well if the photon energy is high enough. In this work we have analyzed the eight Feynmann diagrams
and we have shown that for energies lower to $\sim 1000mc^2$, the assumption just described is not
a good approximation. We propose a different way to work: we classify the electrons into the less
energetic and the most energetic ones without taking into account their origin, and to define, only
to keep the experimental treatment that the less energetic ones will be called the recoil electrons,
while the most energetic ones will be called the pair or created electron. Under these conditions
(lower or higher energy value), we have calculated the contribution of the different diagrams to
the distribution, and how these distributions are modified by introducing a threshold for the momentum
detection for electrons. We also compare the energy distribution obtained by us with that obtained
by Haug. For the study of polarization it is important to know the final direction of the particles.
Considering this, results are also presented on the angular distribution of particles for high-energy
gamma rays (where only Borsellino diagrams predominate).
