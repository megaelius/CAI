There is a category of stable non-baryonic dark matter particles in the universe at the present time:
fermions or bosons with mass ~10^(-1) eV. The existence of these do not contradict the dip phenomena
of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic ray spectrum at ~10^(15) eV ("knee") and ~10^(18) eV ("ankle"),
nor the existence of galaxies at large red shift z~10. The mass scales sequence connected by a large
number A, especially the superstructure scale, is helpful in the understanding of the Hubble constant
and the cosmological constant. The extension part of this paper describes the extension of mass
scales sequence, new interactions, and new particles (u-particle, Planck particle, A-particle,
delta-particle...), which can be used to explore the state of matter with super-high density (much
greater than nuclear density), finite universe, inflation, lightest black hole (LBH) etc in the
early universe; 10^(18) eV is an important energy scale, when the universe tends to critical status
and the inflation appears as a step by step fission process of black holes, so the CMB may have a fine
grain structure. As for the LBH, they may be a candidate of dark matter, and especially, play an important
role in inflation. A Twofold Standard Model suggests pi'(0) particle, heavy electron, CGB and the
increase of GZK-limit; and the diagram of mass scales sequence hints a multi-fold SM (nonlinear).
For beyond SM, the key is to search for the TeV particles @CERN in near future. To accurately measure
the rate of change for the speed of light and the Planck constant h at the present time year after year
is a very important step, that can check whether the cosmological constant is existent or not.
