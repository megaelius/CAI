A very massive star with a carbon-oxygen core in the range of $64$ M$_{\odot}<M_{\mathrm{CO}}<133$
M$_{\odot}$ is expected to undergo a very different kind of explosion known as a pair instability
supernova. Pair instability supernovae are candidates for superluminous supernovae due to the
prodigious amounts of radioactive elements they create. While the basic mechanism for the explosion
is understood, how a star reaches a state is not, thus observations of a nearby pair-instability
supernova would allow us to test current models of stellar evolution at the extreme of stellar masses.
Much will be sought within the electromagnetic radiation we detect from such a supernova but we should
not forget that the neutrinos from a pair-instability supernova contain unique signatures of the
event that unambiguously identify this type of explosion. We calculate the expected neutrino flux
at Earth from two, one-dimensional pair-instability supernova simulations which bracket the
mass range of stars which explode by this mechanism taking into account the full time and energy dependence
of the neutrino emission and the flavor evolution through the outer layers of the star. We calculate
the neutrino signals in five different detectors chosen to represent present or near future designs.
We find the more massive progenitors explode as pair-instability supernova which can easily be
detected in multiple different neutrino detectors at the `standard' supernova distance of $10\;{\rm
kpc}$ producing several events in DUNE, JUNE and SuperKamiokande, while the lightest progenitors
only produce a handful of events (if any) in the same detectors. The proposed HyperKamiokande detector
would detect neutrinos from a large pair-instability supernova as far as $\sim 50\;{\rm kpc}$ allowing
it to reach the Megallanic Clouds and the several very high mass stars known to exist there.
