The dilaton low-energy effective field theory (EFT) of an emergent light scalar is probed in the
paradigm of strongly coupled near-conformal gauge theories. These studies are motivated by models
which exhibit small $\beta$-functions near the conformal window (CW), perhaps with slow scale-dependent
walking and a light scalar with ${ 0^{++} }$ quantum numbers. We report our results from the hypothesis
of a dilaton inspired EFT analysis with two massless fermions in the two-index symmetric (sextet)
representation of the SU(3) color gauge group. With important caveats in our conclusions, conformal
symmetry breaking entangled with chiral symmetry breaking would drive the near-conformal infrared
behavior of the theory predicting characteristic dilaton signatures of the light scalar from broken
scale invariance when probed on relevant scales of fermion mass deformations. From a recently reasoned
choice of the dilaton potential in the EFT description~\cite{Golterman:2016lsd} we find an unexpectedly
light dilaton mass in the chiral limit at $m_d/f_\pi = 1.42(25)$, set in units of the pion decay constant
$f_\pi$. Subject to further statistical and systematic tests of continued post-conference analysis,
this result is significantly lower than our earlier estimates from less controlled extrapolations
of the light scalar (the $\sigma$-particle) to the massless fermion limit of chiral perturbation
theory. We also discuss important distinctions between the dilaton EFT analysis and the linear
$\sigma$-model without dilaton signatures. For comparative reasons, we comment on dilaton tests
from recent work with fermions in the fundamental representation with $n_f=8$ flavors.
