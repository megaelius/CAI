We study a model with a down-type SU(2) singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) as a minimal extension of
the standard model (SM). In this model, flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs) arise at tree level
and the unitarity of the $3\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix does not hold. In this
paper, we constrain the FCNC coupling from $b\rightarrow s$ transitions, especially $B_s\rightarrow
\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$ processes. In order to analyze these processes,
we derive an effective Lagrangian which is valid below the electroweak symmetry breaking scale.
For this purpose, we first integrate out the VLQ field and derive an effective theory by matching
Wilson coefficients up to one-loop level. Using the effective theory, we construct the effective
Lagrangian for $b\rightarrow s\gamma^{(*)}$. It includes the effects of the SM quarks and the violation
of the CKM unitarity. We show the constraints on the magnitude of the FCNC coupling and its phase by
taking account of the current experimental data on $\Delta M_{B_s}$, $\mathrm{Br}[B_s\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-]$,
$\mathrm{Br}[\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma]$ and CKM matrix elements as well as theoretical
uncertainties. We find that the constraint from the $\mathrm{Br}[B_s\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-]$
is more stringent than that from the $\mathrm{Br}[\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$]. We also obtain
the bound for the mass of the VLQ and the strength of the Yukawa couplings related to the FCNC coupling
of $b\rightarrow s$ transition. Using the CKM elements which satisfy above constraints, we show
how the unitarity is violated on the complex plane.
