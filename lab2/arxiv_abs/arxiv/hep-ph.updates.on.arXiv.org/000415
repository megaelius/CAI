We consider the dark matter (DM) scenario in the context of the classically conformal U(1)' extended
standard model (SM), with three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) and the U(1)' Higgs field. The model
is free from all the U(1)' gauge and gravitational anomalies in the presence of the three RHNs. We
introduce a $Z_2$-parity in the model, under which an odd-parity is assigned to one RHN, while all
the other particles is assigned to be $Z_2$-even, and hence the $Z_2$-odd RHN serves as a DM candidate.
In this model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry is radiatively broken through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism,
by which the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered. There are three free parameters in our
model, the U(1)' charge of the SM Higgs doublet ($x_H$), the new U(1)' gauge coupling ($g_X$), and
the U(1)' gauge boson ($Z'$) mass ($m_{Z'}$), which are severely constrained in order to solve the
electroweak vacuum instability problem, and satisfy the LHC Run-2 bounds from the search for $Z'$
boson resonance. In addition to these constraints, we investigate the RHN DM physics. Because of
the nature of classical conformality, we find that a RHN DM pair mainly annihilates into the SM particles
through the $Z'$ boson exchange. This is the so-called $Z'$-portal DM scenario. Combining the electroweak
vacuum stability condition, the LHC Run-2 bounds, and the cosmological constraint from the observed
DM relic density, we find that all constrains complementarily work to narrow down the allowed parameter
regions, and, especially, exclude $m_{Z'} \lesssim 3.5$ TeV. For the obtained allowed regions,
we calculate the spin-independent cross section of the RHN DM with nucleons. We find that the resultant
cross section well below the current experimental upper bounds.
