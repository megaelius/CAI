We apply classical gluodynamics to early stages of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We
start by going through the space-time evolution of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions in
the color glass condensate framework and the basics of real-time gluodynamics on the lattice in
the temporal gauge. We study the plasmon mass scale in three- and two-dimensional systems by comparing
three different methods to measure the mass scale. The methods are a formula which can be derived
from Hard Thermal Loop effective theory at leading order (HTL), the effective dispersion relation
(DR) and measurement of the plasma oscillation frequency triggered by the introduction of a uniform
electric field (UE) into the system. We observe that in both systems the plasmon mass scale decreases
like a power law after an occupation number dependent initial transient time. In both cases the UE
and HTL methods are in rough agreement, and in the three-dimensional case the two agree in the continuum
limit. As a second way to study the quasiparticle properties, we derive, implement and test an algorithm
which can be used to simulate linearized fluctuations on top of the classical background. The algorithm
is derived by requiring conservation of Gauss' law and gauge invariance. We then apply the algorithm
to spectral properties of overoccupied gluodynamics using linear response theory. We establish
the existence of transverse and longitudinal quasiparticles by extracting their spectral functions.
We also extract the dispersion relation, effective mass, plasmon mass and damping rate of the quasiparticles.
Our results are consistent with the HTL effective theory, but we also observe effects beyond leading
order HTL.
