We propose an experimental setup to observe coherent elastic neutrino-atom scattering (CE$\nu$AS)
using electron antineutrinos from tritium decay and a liquid helium target. In this scattering
process with the whole atom, that has not beeen observed so far, the electrons tend to screen the weak
charge of the nucleus as seen by the electron antineutrino probe. The interference between the nucleus
and the electron cloud produces a sharp dip in the recoil spectrum at atomic recoil energies of about
9 meV, reducing sizeably the number of expected events with respect to the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering case. We estimate that with a 60 g tritium source surrounded by 500 kg of liquid helium
in a cylindrical tank, one could observe the existence of CE$\nu$AS processes at 3$\sigma$ in 5 years
of data taking. Keeping the same amount of helium and the same data-taking period, we test the sensitivity
to the Weinberg angle and a possible neutrino magnetic moment for three different scenarios: 60
g, 160 g, and 500 g of tritium. In the latter scenario, the Standard Model (SM) value of the Weinberg
angle can be measured with a statistical uncertainty of $\sin^2{\vartheta_W^{\mathrm{SM}}}^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$.
This would represent the lowest-energy measurement of $\sin^2{\vartheta_W}$, with the advantage
of being not affected by the uncertainties on the neutron form factor of the nucleus as the current
lowest-energy determination. Finally, we study the sensitivity of this apparatus to a possible
electron neutrino magnetic moment and we find that using 60 g of tritium it is possible to set an upper
limit of about $7\times10^{-13}\,\mu_B$ at 90% C.L., that is more than one order of magnitude smaller
than the current experimental limit.
