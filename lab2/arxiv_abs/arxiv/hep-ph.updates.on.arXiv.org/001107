We explore the possibility that the dark-matter relic abundance is generated in a context where
the inflaton is the only mediator between the visible and the hidden sectors of our universe. Due
to the relatively large mass of the inflaton field, such a portal leads to an extremely feeble interaction
between the dark and the visible sectors suggesting that the dark sector cannot reach any thermal
equilibrium with the visible sector. After the two sectors are populated by the decay of the inflaton,
a heavy dark-matter particle thermally decouples within the dark sector. Later, a lighter dark
particle, whose decay width is naturally suppressed by the inflaton propagator, decays into the
visible sector after it dominates the energy density of universe. This process dilutes the dark-matter
relic density by injecting entropy in the visible sector. We show that an inflaton mass of $\mathcal{O}(10^{13})$
GeV together with couplings of order one are fully compatible with a dark-matter relic abundance
$\Omega h^2\sim 0.1$. As a general feature of the model, the entropy dilution mechanism is accompanied
by a period of early matter domination, which modifies the amount of e-folds of inflation necessary
to accommodate Planck data. Moreover, the coupling of the inflaton to the dark and visible sectors
brings loop contributions to the inflationary potential which can destabilize the inflation trajectory.
Considering all these complementary constraints, we show that, in the context of a plateau-inflation
scenario such as the $\alpha$-attractor model, the inflaton can constitute a viable mediator between
the visible sector and a $\sim 10$ EeV dark-matter candidate. Furthermore, we show that improved
constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index could potentially rule out dark-matter
scenarios of this sort in the future.
