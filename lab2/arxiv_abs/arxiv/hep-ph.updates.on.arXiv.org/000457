QCD constituent counting rules define the scaling behavior of exclusive hadronic scattering and
electromagnetic scattering amplitudes at high momentum transfer in terms of the total number of
fundamental constituents in the initial and final states participating in the hard subprocess.
The scaling laws reflect the twist of the leading Fock state for each hadron and hence the leading
operator that creates the composite state from the vacuum. Thus, the constituent counting scaling
laws can be used to identify the twist of exotic hadronic candidates such as tetraquarks and pentaquarks.
Effective field theories must consistently implement the scaling rules in order to be consistent
with the fundamental theory. Here we examine how one can apply constituent counting rules for the
exclusive production of one or two neutral vector mesons $V^0$ in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation, processes
in which the $V^0$ can couple via intermediate photons. In case of a (narrow) real $V^0$, the photon
virtuality is fixed to a precise value $s_1 = m_{V^0}^2$, in effect treating the $V^0$ as a single
fundamental particle. Each real $V^0$ thus contributes to the constituent counting rules with
$N_{V_0} = 1$. In effect, the leading operator underlying the $V^0$ has twist 1. Thus, in the specific
physical case of single or double on-shell $V^0$ production via intermediate photons, the predicted
scaling from counting rules coincides with Vector Meson Dominance (VMD), an effective theory that
treats $V^0$ as an elementary field. However, the VMD prediction fails in the general case where
the $V^0$ is not coupled through an elementary photon field, and then the leading-twist interpolating
operator has twist $N_{V_0} = 2$. Analogous effects appear in $pp$ scattering processes.
