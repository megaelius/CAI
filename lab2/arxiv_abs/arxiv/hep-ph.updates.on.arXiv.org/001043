Neutrino-nucleus $\nu A\to \nu A$ and antineutrino-nucleus $\bar\nu A\to \bar\nu A$ interactions,
when the nucleus conserves its integrity, are discussed with coherent (elastic) and incoherent
(inelastic) scattering regimes taken into account. In the first regime the nucleus remains in the
same quantum state after the scattering and the cross-section depends on the quadratic number of
nucleons. In the second regime the nucleus changes its quantum state and the cross-section has an
essentially linear dependence on the number of nucleons. The coherent and incoherent cross-sections
are driven by a nuclear nucleon form-factor squared $|F|^2$ term and a $(1-|F|^2)$ term, respectively.
One has a smooth transition between the regimes of coherent and incoherent (anti)neutrino-nucleus
scattering. Due to the neutral current nature these elastic and inelastic processes are indistinguishable
if the nucleus recoil energy is only observed. One way to separate the coherent signal from the incoherent
one is to register $\gamma$ quanta from deexcitation of the nucleus excited during the incoherent
scattering. Another way is to use a very low-energy threshold detector and collect data at very low
recoil energies, where the incoherent scattering is vanishingly small. In particular, for ${}^{133}\text{Cs}$
and neutrino energies of 30--50 MeV the incoherent cross-section is about 15-20\% of the coherent
one. Therefore, the COHERENT experiment (with ${}^{133}\text{Cs}$) has measured the coherent
elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) with the inelastic admixture at a level of 15-20\%,
if the excitation $\gamma$ quantum escapes its detection.
