A coupling of a dark photon $A'$ from a $U(1)_{A'}$ with the standard model (SM) particles can be generated
through kinetic mixing represented by a parameter $\epsilon$. A non-zero $\epsilon$ also induces
a mixing between $A'$ and $Z$ if dark photon mass $m_{A'}$ is not zero. This mixing can be large when
$m_{A'}$ is close to $m_Z$ even if the parameter $\epsilon$ is small. Many efforts have been made
to constrain the parameter $\epsilon$ for a low dark photon mass $m_{A'}$ compared with the $Z$ boson
mass $m_Z$. We study the search for dark photon in $e^+e^- \to \gamma A' \to \gamma \mu^+ \mu^-$ for
a dark photon mass $m_{A'}$ as large as kinematically allowed at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. For
large $m_{A'}$, care should be taken to properly treat possible large mixing between $A'$ and $Z$.
We obtain sensitivities to the parameter $\epsilon$ for a wide range of dark photon mass at planed
$e^+\;e^-$ colliders, such as Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), International Linear
Collider (ILC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). For the dark photon mass $20~\text{GeV}\lesssim
m_{A^{\prime}}\lesssim 330~\text{GeV}$, the $2\sigma$ exclusion limits on the mixing parameter
are $\epsilon\lesssim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. The CEPC with $\sqrt{s}=240~\text{GeV}$ and FCC-ee
with $\sqrt{s}=160~\text{GeV}$ are more sensitive than the constraint from current LHCb measurement
once the dark photon mass $m_{A^{\prime}}\gtrsim 50~\text{GeV}$. For $m_{A^{\prime}}\gtrsim
220~\text{GeV}$, the sensitivity at the FCC-ee with $\sqrt{s}=350~\text{GeV}$ and $1.5~\text{ab}^{-1}$
is better than that at the 13~TeV LHC with $300~\text{fb}^{-1}$, while the sensitivity at the CEPC
with $\sqrt{s}=240~\text{GeV}$ and $5~\text{ab}^{-1}$ can be even better than that at 13~TeV
LHC with $3~\text{ab}^{-1}$ for $m_{A^{\prime}}\gtrsim 180~\text{GeV}$.
