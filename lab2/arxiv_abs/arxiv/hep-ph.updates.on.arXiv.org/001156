Heavy neutrinos $(N)$ remain one of most promising explanations for the origin of neutrinos' tiny
masses and large mixing angles. In light of broad advances in understanding and modeling of hadron
collisions at large momentum transfer, we revisit the long-standard search strategy for heavy
$N$ decaying to multiple charged leptons $(\ell)$, $pp \to N\ell X \to 3\ell \nu X$. For electroweak
and TeV-scale $N$, we propose a qualitatively new collider analysis premised on a dynamic jet veto
and discriminating, on an event-by-event basis, according to the relative amount of hadronic and
leptonic activity. We report that the sensitivity to $N$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be
improved by roughly an order of magnitude over the collider's lifetime. At $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV with
$\mathcal{L}=3~{\rm ab}^{-1}$, active-sterile mixing as small as $\vert V_{\ell N}\vert^2 =
10^{-2} ~(10^{-3})~[5\times10^{-4}]$ can be probed at $95\%$ CL for Dirac neutrinos masses $m_N
\lesssim 1200~(300)~[200]$ GeV, well beyond present constraints for such heavy states. The improvement
holds also for Majorana $N$, and is largely independent of whether charged lepton flavor is conserved
or violated. The analysis, built almost entirely from inclusive, transverse observables, is designed
to be robust across increasing collider energies, and hence serves as a basis for searches at future
colliders: With $\mathcal{L}=15~{\rm ab}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=27$ TeV, one can probe mixing below
$\vert V_{\ell N}\vert^2 = 10^{-2} ~(10^{-3})~[2\times10^{-4}]$ for $m_N \lesssim 3500~(700)~[200]$
GeV. At a hypothetical 100 TeV $pp$ collider with $\mathcal{L}=30~{\rm ab}^{-1}$, one can probe
below $\vert V_{\ell N}\vert^2 = 9\times10^{-5}~(10^{-3})~[10^{-2}]$ for $m_N \lesssim 200$
GeV ($4$ TeV) [$15$ TeV]. We anticipate these results can be further improved with detector-specific
tuning and application of machines learning techniques.
