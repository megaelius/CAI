Our main interest is the evolution of domain walls of the Higgs field in the early Universe. The aim
of this paper is to understand how dynamics of Higgs domain walls could be influenced by yet unknown
interactions from beyond the Standard Model. We assume that the Standard Model is valid up to certain,
high, energy scale $\Lambda$ and use the framework of the effective field theory to describe physics
below that scale. Performing numerical simulations with different values of the scale $\Lambda$
we are able to extend our previous analysis and determine its range of validity. We study domain walls
interpolating between the physical electroweak vacuum and the vacuum appearing at very high field
strengths. These domain walls could be formed from non-homogeneous configurations of the Higgs
field produced by quantum fluctuations during inflation or thermal fluctuations during reheating.
Our numerical simulations show that evolution of Higgs domain walls is rather insensitive to interactions
beyond the Standard Model as long as masses of new particles are grater than $10^{12}\ \textrm{GeV}$.
For lower values of $\Lambda$ the RG improved effective potential is strongly modified at field
strengths crucial to the evolution of domain walls. For instance its minima become degenerate for
$\Lambda$ around $10^{11}\ \textrm{GeV}$. We find that even in the case when the minima of the potential
are nearly degenerate Higgs domain walls decayed shortly after their formation for generic initial
conditions. On the other hand, in simulations with specifically chosen initial conditions Higgs
domain walls can live longer and enter the scaling regime. We also determine the energy spectrum
of gravitational waves produced by decaying domain walls of the Higgs field. For generic initial
field configurations the amplitude of the signal is too small to be observed in present and planned
detectors.
