Exclusive electroproduction of $\omega$ mesons on unpolarized hydrogen and deuterium targets
is studied in the kinematic region of Q$^2$>1.0 GeV$^2$, 3.0 GeV < W < 6.3 GeV, and -t'<
0.2 GeV$^2$. Results on the angular distribution of the $\omega$ meson, including its decay products,
are presented. The data were accumulated with the HERMES forward spectrometer during the 1996-2007
running period using the 27.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron or positron beam of HERA. The
determination of the virtual-photon longitudinal-to-transverse cross-section ratio reveals
that a considerable part of the cross section arises from transversely polarized photons. Spin
density matrix elements are presented in projections of Q$^2$ or -t'. Violation of s-channel helicity
conservation is observed for some of these elements. A sizable contribution from unnatural-parity-exchange
amplitudes is found and the phase shift between those amplitudes that describe transverse $\omega$
production by longitudinal and transverse virtual photons, $\gamma^{*}_{L} \to \omega_{T}$
and $\gamma^{*}_{T} \to \omega_{T}$, is determined for the first time. A hierarchy of helicity
amplitudes is established, which mainly means that the unnatural-parity-exchange amplitude
describing the $\gamma^*_T \to \omega_T$ transition dominates over the two natural-parity-exchange
amplitudes describing the $\gamma^*_L \to \omega_L$ and $\gamma^*_T \to \omega_T$ transitions,
with the latter two being of similar magnitude. Good agreement is found between the HERMES proton
data and results of a pQCD-inspired phenomenological model that includes pion-pole contributions,
which are of unnatural parity.
