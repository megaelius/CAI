We analyse new signals of Dark Matter (DM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in a 3-Higgs Doublet
Model (3HDM) where only one doublet acquires a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), preserving a parity
$Z_2$. The other two doublets are \textit{inert} and do not develop a VEV, leading to a {\it dark scalar
sector} controlled by $Z_2$, with the lightest CP-even dark scalar $H_1$ being the DM candidate.
This leads to the loop induced decay of the next-to-lightest scalar, $H_2 \to H_1 f \bar f$ ($f=u,d,c,s,b,e,\mu,\tau$),
mediated by both dark CP-odd and charged scalars. This is a smoking-gun signal of the 3HDM since it
is not allowed in the 2HDM with one inert doublet and is expected to be important when $H_2$ and $H_1$
are close in mass. In practice, this signature can be observed in the cascade decay of the SM-like
Higgs boson, $h\to H_1 H_2\to H_1 H_1 f \bar f$ into two DM particles and di-leptons/di-jets, where
$h$ is produced from either gluon-gluon Fusion (ggF) or Vector Boson Fusion (VBF). However, this
signal competes with the tree-level channel $q\bar q\to H_1H_1Z^*\to H_1H_1f \bar f$. We devise
some benchmarks, compliant with collider, DM and cosmological data, for which the interplay between
these modes is discussed. In particular, we show that the resulting detector signature, $\Et\;
f \bar f$, with invariant mass of $ f \bar f$ much smaller than $m_Z$, can potentially be extracted
already during Run 2 and 3. %Finally, we highlight that, once this $f \bar f$ signal is established
and some information on the $H_2$ and $H_1$ masses has been obtained, the latter can be used to extract
specific manifestations of the prevalent $H_2\to H_1\gamma^*$ decay, by considering, For example,
the $H_2\to H_1\gamma^*$ and $\gamma^*\to e^+e^-$ case will give a spectacular QED mono-shower
signal.
