We are discussing the properties of the QCD vacuum which might be important especially for the understanding
of hadrons with small quark core size $\sim0.3\,fm.$ We assume that at these distances the QCD vacuum
can be described by the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM). At larger distances, where confinement is
important, ILM should be extended to Dyons Liquid Model (DLM). The ILM has only two free parameters,
average instanton size $\rho\approx0.3\,fm$ and average inter-instanton distance $R\approx1\,fm$,
and can successfully describe the key features of light hadron physics. One of the important conceptual
results was prediction of the momentum dependent dynamical quark mass $M\sim(packing\,\,fraction)^{1/2}\,\,\rho^{-1}\approx360\,MeV$,
later confirmed numerically by evaluations in the lattice. The estimates show that gluon-instanton
interaction strength is also big and is controlled by the value of dynamical gluon mass $M_{g}\approx
M$. Heavy quarks interact with instantons much weaker. The heavy quark-instanton interaction
strength is given by $\Delta m_{Q}\sim packing\,\,fraction\,\,\rho^{-1}\approx70\,MeV.$
Nevertheless, the direct instanton contribution to the colorless heavy-heavy quarks potential
is sizable and must be taken into account. At small distances, where one-gluon exchange contribution
to this potential is dominated, we have to take into account dynamical gluon mass $M_{g}$. Also,
instantons are generating light-heavy quarks interactions and allow to describe the nonperturbative
effects in heavy-light quarks systems. %% MS: Not sure what is tt: % Also, tt were calculated their
contribution to the heavy-heavy quark potential (light quark flavors number $N_f=1$ case) and
also heavy quark-pions interaction term ($N_f=2$).
