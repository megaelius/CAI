Motivated by the persistent anomalies in the semileptonic $B$-meson decays, we investigate the
competency of the LHC data to constrain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$-favoured parameter space in two minimal
scenarios (I and II) with a charge $-1/3$ scalar leptoquark. Both the scenarios have only one free
coupling that has to be large to accommodate the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomalies. As a result, Scenario-I
dominantly yields non-resonant $\tau\tau$ and $\tau\nu$ events at the LHC through the $t$-channel
leptoquark exchange. So far, no experiment has searched for leptoquarks using these signatures
and the relevant resonant leptoquark searches are yet to put any strong exclusion limit on the parameter
space. We recast the latest $\tau\tau$ and $\tau\nu$ resonance search data to obtain new exclusion
limits in this scenario. The non-resonant processes strongly interfere (destructively in our
case) with the Standard Model background and play the determining role in setting the exclusion
limits. To obtain precise limits, we include non-negligible effects coming from the sub-dominant
(resonant) pair and inclusive single leptoquark productions systematically in our analysis.
To deal with a large destructive interference, we make use of the transverse mass distributions
from the experiments in our statistical analysis. In addition, we also recast the relevant direct
search results to obtain the most stringent limits on our minimal scenarios to date. We find that
the $R_{D^{(*)}}$-favoured parameter space in Scenario-I is already ruled out by the LHC data,
but it is largely allowed in Scenario-II. We also consider a next-to-minimal scenario where both
the free couplings from the minimal scenarios are present. We find that a sub-TeV leptoquark which
is still allowed by the LHC data can explain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomalies with order electroweak
couplings.
