In the standard model, the weak scale is the only parameter with mass dimensions. This means that
the standard model itself can not explain the origin of the weak scale. On the other hand, from the
results of recent accelerator experiments, except for some small corrections, the standard model
has increased the possibility of being an effective theory up to the Planck scale. From these facts,
it is naturally inferred that the weak scale is determined by some dynamics from the Planck scale.
In order to answer this question, we rely on the multiple point criticality principle as a clue and
consider the classically conformal $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant two scalar
model as a minimal model in which the weak scale is generated dynamically from the Planck scale. This
model contains only two real scalar fields and does not contain any fermions and gauge fields. In
this model, due to Coleman-Weinberg-like mechanism, one scalar field spontaneously breaks the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry with a vacuum expectation value connected with the cutoff momentum. We
investigate this using the 1-loop effective potential, renormalization group and large N limit.
We also investigate whether it is possible to reproduce the mass term and vacuum expectation value
of the Higgs field by coupling this model with the standard model in the Higgs portal framework. In
this case, the one scalar field that does not break $\mathbb{Z}_2$ can be a candidate for dark matter,
and have a mass of about several TeV in appropriate parameters. On the other hand, the other scalar
field breaks $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and has a mass of several tens of GeV. These results can be verified in
near future experiments.
