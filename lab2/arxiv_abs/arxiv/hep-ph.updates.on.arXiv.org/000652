In this work we revisit the question of whether Cosmology can be made compatible with scenarios with
light sterile neutrinos, as invoked to explain the SBL anomalies, in the presence of self-interaction
among sterile neutrinos mediated by massive gauge bosons. We examine this proposal by deriving
the cosmological predictions of the model in a wide range of the model parameters including the effective
interaction strength $G_X$, sterile neutrino mass $m_{\rm st}$ and active-sterile mixings. With
those we perform a statistical analysis of the cosmological data from BBN, CMB, and BAO data to infer
the posterior probabilities of the sterile self-interaction model parameters. BBN mostly provides
information about the effective interaction strength and we find that $\log_{10}(G_X/G_F)\geq
3.6$ can describe the primordial abundances at 95% CL. Our analysis of CMB and BAO data show that when
allowing a wide prior for the sterile neutrino mass its posterior is bounded to $m_{\rm st}\leq 0.91~{\rm
eV}$ (95% CL) considering CMB data only and $m_{\rm st}\leq 0.37~{\rm eV}$ (95% CL) when adding the
BAO information. So the mass bounds are slighly relaxed compared with that of a non-interacting
sterile neutrino model but a sterile neutrino mass of 1 eV is still excluded at more than $2\sigma$
CL. Conversely if fixing the sterile neutrino mass and mixing to the values prefered by short baseline
data we find that while that CMB data alone favors the self-interacting scenario, including the
BAO information severly degrades the agreement with the model. Altogether we conclude then that
adding the self-interaction can alleviate the tension between eV sterile neutrinos and CMB data,
but when including also the BAO results the self-interacting sterile neutrino model cannot lead
to a satisfactory description of the data.
