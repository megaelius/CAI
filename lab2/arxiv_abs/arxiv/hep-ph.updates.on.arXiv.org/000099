Under the conventional scale setting, the renormalization scale uncertainty usually constitutes
a systematic error for a fixed-order perturbative QCD estimation. The recently suggested principle
of maximum conformality (PMC) provides a principle to eliminate such scale ambiguity in a step-by-step
way. Using the PMC, all non-conformal terms in perturbative expansion series are summed into the
running coupling, and one obtains a unique, scale-fixed, scheme-independent prediction at any
finite order. In the paper, we make a detailed PMC analysis for both the polarized and the unpolarized
cross sections for the double charmonium production process, $e^{+} + e^{-} \to J/ \psi (\psi')
+ \chi_{cJ}$ with $(J=0,1,2)$. The running behavior for the coupling constant, governed by the
PMC scales, are determined exactly for the specific processes. We compare our predictions with
the measurements at the $B$ factories, BABAR and Belle, and the theoretical estimations obtained
in the literature. Because the non-conformal terms are different for various polarized and unpolarized
cross sections, the PMC scales of these cross sections are different in principle. It is found that
all the PMC scales are almost independent of the initial choice of renormalization scale. Thus,
the large renormalization scale uncertainty usually adopted in the literature up to $sim40%$ at
the NLO level, obtained from the conventional scale setting, for both the polarized and the unpolarized
cross sections are greatly suppressed. It is found that the charmonium production is dominated
by J=0 channel. After PMC scale setting, we obtain $\sigma(J/\psi+\chi_{c0}) = 12.25^{+3.70}_{-3.13}$
fb and $\sigma(\psi'+\chi_{c0}) =5.23^{+1.56}_{-1.32}$ fb,......
