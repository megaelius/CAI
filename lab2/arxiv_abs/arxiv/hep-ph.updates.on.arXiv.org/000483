We derive the electroweak (EW) collinear splitting functions for the Standard Model, including
the massive fermions, gauge bosons and the Higgs boson. We first present the splitting functions
in the limit of unbroken SU(2)xU(1) and discuss their general features in the collinear and soft-collinear
regimes. We then systematically incorporate EW symmetry breaking (EWSB), which leads to the emergence
of additional "ultra-collinear" splitting phenomena and naive violations of the Goldstone-boson
Equivalence Theorem. We suggest a particularly convenient choice of non-covariant gauge (dubbed
"Goldstone Equivalence Gauge") that disentangles the effects of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields
in the presence of EWSB, and allows trivial book-keeping of leading power corrections in the VEV.
We implement a comprehensive, practical EW showering scheme based on these splitting functions
using a Sudakov evolution formalism. Novel features in the implementation include a complete accounting
of ultra-collinear effects, matching between shower and decay, kinematic back-reaction corrections
in multi-stage showers, and mixed-state evolution of neutral bosons (gamma/Z/h) using density-matrices.
We employ the EW showering formalism to study a number of important physical processes at O(1-10
TeV) energies. They include (a) electroweak partons in the initial state as the basis for vector-boson-fusion;
(b) the emergence of "weak jets" such as those initiated by transverse gauge bosons, with individual
splitting probabilities as large as O(30%); (c) EW showers initiated by top quarks, including Higgs
bosons in the final state; (d) the occurrence of O(1) interference effects within EW showers involving
the neutral bosons; and (e) EW corrections to new physics processes, as illustrated by production
of a heavy vector boson (W') and the subsequent showering of its decay products.
