We consider the extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a strongly interacting QCD-like hidden
sector, at least two generations of right-handed neutrinos and one scalar singlet. Once scalar
singlet obtains a nonzero vacuum expectation value, active neutrino masses are generated through
type-I seesaw mechanism. Simultaneously, the electroweak scale is generated through the radiative
corrections involving these massive fermions. This is the essence of the scenario that is known
as the "neutrino option" for which the successful masses of right-handed neutrinos are in the range
$10^7-10^8$ GeV. The main goal of this work is to scrutinize the potential to accommodate dark matter
in such a realization. The dark matter candidates are Nambu-Goldstone bosons which appear due to
the dynamical breaking of the hidden chiral symmetry. The mass spectrum studied in this work is such
that masses of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and singlet scalar exceed those of right-handed neutrinos.
Having the masses of all relevant particles several orders of magnitude above $\mathcal{O}$(TeV),
the freeze-out of dark matter is not achievable and hence we turn to alternative scenarios, namely
freeze-in. The Nambu-Goldstone bosons can interact with particles that are not in SM but, however,
have non-negligible abundance through their not-too-small couplings with SM. Utilizing this,
we demonstrate that the dark matter in the model is successfully produced at temperature scale where
the right-handed neutrinos are still stable. We note that the lepton number asymmetry sufficient
for the generation of observable baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be produced in right-handed
neutrino decays. Hence, we infer that the model has the potential to simultaneously address several
of the most relevant puzzles in contemporary high-energy physics.
