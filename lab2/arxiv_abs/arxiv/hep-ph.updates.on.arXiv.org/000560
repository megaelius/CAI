We study the Monte Carlo uncertainties due to modeling of hadronization and showering in the extraction
of the top-quark mass from observables that use exclusive hadronic final states in top decays, such
as $t \rightarrow \text{anything+J/}\psi$ or $t\rightarrow \text{anything}+(B\rightarrow
\text{charged tracks})$, where $B$ is a $B$-hadron. To this end, we investigate the sensitivity
of the top-quark mass, determined by means of a few observables already proposed in the literature
as well as some new proposals, to the relevant parameters of event generators, such as HERWIG 6 and
PYTHIA 8. We find that constraining those parameters at $\mathcal{O}(1\%-10\%)$ is required to
avoid a Monte Carlo uncertainty on $m_t$ greater than 500 MeV. For the sake of achieving the needed
accuracy on such parameters, we examine the sensitivity of the top-quark mass measured from spectral
features, such as peaks, endpoints and distributions of $E_{B}$, $m_{B\ell}$, and some $m_{T2}$-like
variables. We find that restricting oneself to regions sufficiently close to the endpoints enables
one to substantially decrease the dependence on the Monte Carlo parameters, but at the price of inflating
significantly the statistical uncertainties. To ameliorate this situation we study how well the
data on top-quark production and decay at the LHC can be utilized to constrain the showering and hadronization
variables. We find that a global exploration of several calibration observables, sensitive to
the Monte Carlo parameters but very mildly to $m_{t}$, can offer useful constraints on the parameters,
as long as such quantities are measured with a 1% precision.
