We explore some aspects of models with two and three SU(2) scalar doublets that lead to mass degeneracies
among some of the physical scalars. In Higgs sectors with two scalar doublets, the exact degeneracy
of scalar masses, without an artificial fine-tuning of the scalar potential parameters, is possible
only in the case of the inert doublet model (IDM), where the scalar potential respects a global U(1)
symmetry that is not broken by the vacuum. In the case of three doublets, we introduce and analyze
the replicated inert doublet model, which possesses two inert doublets of scalars. We then generalize
this model to obtain a scalar potential, first proposed by Ivanov and Silva, with a CP4 symmetry that
guarantees the existence of pairwise degenerate scalar states among two pairs of neutral scalars
and two pairs of charged scalars. Here, CP4 is a generalized CP symmetry with the property that $({\rm
CP}4)^n$ is the identity operator only for integer $n$ values that are multiples of 4. The form of
the CP4-symmetric scalar potential is simplest when expressed in the Higgs basis, where the neutral
scalar field vacuum expectation value resides entirely in one of the scalar doublet fields. The
symmetries of the model permit a term in the scalar potential with a complex coefficient that cannot
be removed by any redefinition of the scalar fields within the class of Higgs bases (in which case,
we say that no real Higgs basis exists). A striking feature of the CP4-symmetric model is that it preserves
CP even in the absence of a real Higgs basis, as illustrated by the cancellation of the contributions
to the CP violating form factors of the effective ZZZ and ZWW vertices.
