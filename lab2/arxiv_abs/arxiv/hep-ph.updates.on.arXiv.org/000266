We consider the scenario, in which the light Higgs scalar boson appears as the Pseudo - Goldstone
boson. We discuss examples both in condensed matter and in relativistic field theory. In $^3$He-B
the symmetry breaking gives rise to 4 Nambu-Goldstone modes and 14 Higgs modes. At lower energy one
of the four NG modes becomes the Higgs boson with small mass. This is the mode measured in experiments
with the longitudinal NMR, and the Higgs mass corresponds to the Leggett frequency $M_{\rm H}=\hbar
\Omega_L$. The formation of the Higgs mass is the result of the violation of the hidden spin-orbit
symmetry at low energy. In this scenario the symmetry breaking energy scale $\Delta$ (the gap in
the fermionic spectrum) and the Higgs mass scale $M_{\rm H}$ are highly separated: $M_{\rm H}\ll
\Delta$. On the particle physics side we consider the model inspired by the models of \cite{dobrescu,Yamawaki}.
At high energies the $SU(3)$ symmetry is assumed that relates the left - handed top and bottom quarks
to the additional fermion $\chi_L$. This symmetry is softly broken at low energies. As a result the
only CP - even Goldstone boson acquires a mass and may be considered as the candidate for the role of
the $125$ GeV scalar boson. We consider the condensation pattern different from the one typical
for the top - seesaw models, where the condensate $\langle \bar{t}_L\chi_R \rangle$ is off - diagonal.
In our case the condensates are mostly diagonal. Unlike \cite{dobrescu,Yamawaki} the explicit
mass terms are absent and the soft breaking of $SU(3)$ symmetry is given solely by the four - fermion
terms. This reveals the complete analogy with $^3$He, where there is no explicit mass term and the
spin - orbit interaction has the form of the four - fermion interaction.
