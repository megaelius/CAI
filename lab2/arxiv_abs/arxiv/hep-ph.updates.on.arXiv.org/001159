In many extentions of standard model, dimension-5 scalar di-photon ($g_{\gamma\gamma\phi}\phi$
$F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$ ) or pseudoscalar di-photon ($g_{\gamma\gamma a}a\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}
F_{\mu\nu} $, ) interaction materializes due to scale symmetry breaking or $U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking.
In a magnetized vacuum (i.e., in an external background field $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu} $) the transverse
degrees of freedom of the photons-- for such systems-- can be described in terms of the form factors
constructed out of the background field strength tensor ($\bar{F}_{\mu\nu} $) and the same for
dynamical photon ($f^{\mu\nu}$); they happen to be $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}$ and ${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$.
These form factors transform differently under CP transformation. While $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}$
(describing polarization orthogonal to B ($|\gamma_{||} >$)) is CP even, the other one, ${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$(
describing polarization along B ($|\gamma_\bot >$), is CP odd. In the interaction Lagrangian,
if the scalar is interchanged with the pseudoscalar, the role of the two form factors just gets interchanged.
Thus for nearly degenerate strengths of the coupling constants ( $g_{\gamma\gamma\phi}$ and $g_{\gamma\gamma
_a}$ ) and masses ($m_\phi$ and $m_a$ ) of the respective candidates, proper identification of one
from the other may become very difficult in laboratory or astrophysics based experiments. The basic
motivation of this investigation is to reduce this uncertainty through incorporation of parity
violating ({\it originating through magnetized medium effects }) part of the photon self-energy
in the effective Lagrangian. This step, in turn affects the (Pseudo) Scalar Photon mixing dynamics
drastically and brings out a significant change in the spectrum of the electromagnetic beam undergoing
such interaction.
