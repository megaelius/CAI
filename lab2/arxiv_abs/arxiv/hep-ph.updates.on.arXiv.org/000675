New physics has traditionally been expected in the high-$p_T$ region at high-energy collider experiments.
If new particles are light and weakly-coupled, however, this focus may be completely misguided:
light particles are typically highly concentrated within a few mrad of the beam line, allowing sensitive
searches with small detectors, and even extremely weakly-coupled particles may be produced in
large numbers there. We propose a new experiment, ForwArd Search ExpeRiment, or FASER, which would
be placed downstream of the ATLAS or CMS interaction point (IP) in the very forward region and operated
concurrently there. Two representative on-axis locations are studied: a far location, $400~\text{m}$
from the IP and just off the beam tunnel, and a near location, just $150~\text{m}$ from the IP and right
behind the TAN neutral particle absorber. For each location, we examine leading neutrino- and beam-induced
backgrounds. As a concrete example of light, weakly-coupled particles, we consider dark photons
produced through light meson decay and proton bremsstrahlung. We find that even a relatively small
and inexpensive cylindrical detector, with a radius of $\sim 10~\text{cm}$ and length of $5-10~\text{m}$,
depending on the location, can discover dark photons in a large and unprobed region of parameter
space with dark photon mass $m_{A'} \sim 10~\text{MeV} - 1~\text{GeV}$ and kinetic mixing parameter
$\epsilon \sim 10^{-7} - 10^{-3}$. FASER will clearly also be sensitive to many other forms of new
physics. We conclude with a discussion of topics for further study that will be essential for understanding
FASER's feasibility, optimizing its design, and realizing its discovery potential.
