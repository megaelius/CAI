In this dissertation, we study the evolution and properties of the relic (or cosmic) neutrino distribution
from neutrino freeze-out at $T=O(1)$ MeV through the free-streaming era up to today, focusing on
the deviation of the neutrino spectrum from equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate the presence
of chemical non-equilibrium that continues to the present day. The work naturally separates into
two parts. The first focuses on aspects of the relic neutrinos that can be explored using conservation
laws. The second part studies the neutrino distribution using the full general relativistic Boltzmann
equation. Part one begins with an overview of the history of the Universe, from just prior to neutrino
freeze-out up through the present day, placing the history of cosmic neutrino evolution in its proper
context. Motivated by the Planck CMB measurements of the effective number of neutrinos, we derive
those properties of neutrino freeze-out that depend only on conservation laws and are independent
of the details of the scattering processes. Part one ends with a characterization of the present
day neutrino spectrum as seen from Earth. The second part of this dissertation focuses on the properties
of cosmic neutrinos that depend on the details of the neutrino reactions, as is necessary for modeling
the non-thermal distortions from equilibrium and computing freeze-out temperatures. We detail
a new spectral method for solving the Boltzmann equation, based on a dynamical basis of orthogonal
polynomials, as well as an improved procedure for analytically simplifying the corresponding
scattering integrals for subsequent numerical computation. We apply these novel solution methods
to solve the Boltzmann equation through the neutrino freeze-out period and perform parametric
studies of the dependence of neutrino freeze-out on standard model parameters.
