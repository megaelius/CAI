The SU(3) quark model encounters a great challenge in describing even-parity mesons. Specifically,
the $q\bar q$ quark model has difficulties in understanding the light scalar mesons below 1 GeV,
scalar and axial-vector charmed mesons and $1^+$ charmonium-like state $X(3872)$. A common wisdom
for the resolution of these difficulties lies on the coupled channel effects which will distort
the quark model calculations. In this work, we focus on the near mass degeneracy of scalar charmed
mesons, $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$, and its implications. Within the framework of heavy meson chiral
perturbation theory, we show that near degeneracy can be qualitatively understood as a consequence
of self-energy effects due to strong coupled channels. Quantitatively, the closeness of $D_{s0}^*$
and $D_0^{*0}$ masses can be implemented by adjusting two relevant strong couplings and the renormalization
scale appearing in the loop diagram. Then this in turn implies the mass similarity of $B_{s0}^*$
and $B_0^{*0}$ mesons. The $P_0^* P'_1$ interaction with the Goldstone boson is crucial for understanding
the phenomenon of near degeneracy. Based on heavy quark symmetry in conjunction with corrections
from QCD and $1/m_Q$ effects, we obtain the masses of $B^*_{(s)0}$ and $B'_{(s)1}$ mesons, for example,
$M_{B_{s0}^*}= (5715\pm1)\,{\rm MeV}+\delta\Delta_S$, $M_{B'_{s1}}=(5763\pm1)\,{\rm MeV}+\delta\Delta_S$
with $\delta\Delta_S$ being $1/m_Q$ corrections. We find that the predicted mass difference of
48 MeV between $B'_{s1}$ and $B_{s0}^*$ is larger than that of $20\sim 30$ MeV inferred from the relativistic
quark models, whereas the difference of 15 MeV between the central values of $M_{B'_{s1}}$ and $M_{B'_1}$
is much smaller than the quark model expectation of $60-100$ MeV.
