The exact analytical formulas for the transverse momentum distributions of the Bose-Einstein,
Fermi-Dirac and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics of particles with nonzero mass in the framework
of the Tsallis normalized and Tsallis unnormalized (also known as Tsallis-1 and Tsallis-2) statistics
have been consistently derived. The final exact results were expressed in terms of the series expansions
in the integral representation. The zeroth term approximation to both quantum and classical statistics
of particles has been introduced. We have revealed that the phenomenological classical Tsallis
distribution (widely used in high energy physics) is equal to the distribution of the Tsallis unnormalized
statistics in the zeroth term approximation, but the phenomenological quantum Tsallis distributions
(introduced by definition on the basis of the generalized entropy of the ideal gas) do not correspond
to the distributions of the Tsallis statistics. We have found that in the ranges of the entropic parameter
relevant to the processes of high-energy physics ($q<1$ for Tsallis-1 and $q>1$ for Tsallis-2)
the Tsallis statistics is divergent. Therefore, to obtain physical results, we have regularized
the Tsallis statistics by introducing an upper cut-off in the series expansion. The exact numerical
results for the Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics of particles in
the Tsallis normalized and unnormalized statistics have been obtained. We observed that the exact
results of the Tsallis statistics strongly enhanced the production of high-$p_{T}$ hadrons in
comparison with the usual phenomenological Tsallis distribution function at the same values of
$q$. The $q$-duality of the Tsallis normalized and unnormalized statistics for the massive particles
was studied.
