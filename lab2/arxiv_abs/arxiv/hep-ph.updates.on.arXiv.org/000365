Primordial black holes (PBHs) have long been a candidate for the elusive dark matter (DM), and remain
poorly constrained in the ~20-100 Msun mass range. PBH binaries were recently suggested as the possible
source of LIGO's first detections. In this paper, we thoroughly revisit existing estimates of the
merger rate of PBH binaries. We compute the probability distribution of orbital parameters for
PBH binaries formed in the early Universe, accounting for tidal torquing by all other PBHs, as well
as standard large-scale adiabatic perturbations. We then check whether the orbital parameters
of PBH binaries formed in the early Universe can be significantly affected between formation and
merger. Our analytic estimates indicate that the tidal field of halos and interactions with other
PBHs, as well as dynamical friction by unbound standard DM particles, do not do significant work
on nor torque PBH binaries. We estimate the torque due to baryon accretion to be much weaker than previous
calculations, albeit possibly large enough to significantly affect the eccentricity of typical
PBH binaries. We also revisit the PBH-binary merger rate resulting from gravitational capture
in present-day halos, accounting for Poisson fluctuations. If binaries formed in the early Universe
survive to the present time, as suggested by our analytic estimates, they dominate the total PBH
merger rate. Moreover, this merger rate would be orders of magnitude larger than LIGO's current
upper limits if PBHs make a significant fraction of the dark matter. As a consequence, LIGO would
constrain ~10-300 Msun PBHs to constitute no more than ~1% of the dark matter. To make this conclusion
fully robust, though, numerical study of several complex astrophysical processes - such as the
formation of the first PBH halos and how they may affect PBH binaries, as well as the accretion of gas
onto an extremely eccentric binary - is needed.
