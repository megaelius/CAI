We interpret anomalies, deviations, from the standard model as being in fact due to effects not given
by perturbation, because the top Yukawa coupling is after all so large that not by perturbation effects
become important. Most of the anomalies found have the character of signaling violation of lepton
universality. There are four lepton universality violating anomalies known at present, which
we shall fit with one overall scale parameter to order of magnitude accuracy. One can look at the picture
that we have found - due to the rather strong top Yukawa coupling - as a new sector of strongly interacting
particles analogous to quantum color dynamics inside the standard model! In addition we treat what
is presumably also an anomaly: the experimental value of the direct charge conjugation parity violation
parameter epsilon prime over epsilon turns out to be a factor 2 or more larger than the standard model
prediction,but fit our model. However if we include in our anomaly model such processes not involving
leptons (but only quarks), it seems superficially that we obtain very large - and unacceptable -
anomalies in meson zero meson zero bar etc. mixing. To rescue our model from this falsification,
we think of the interacting quarks as provided with clouds (on half terra electron volt scale) of,
and that too strongly interacting such clouds cannot penetrate into each other. Thereby the interactions
and thus the resulting anomalies are damped. Even with such a crutch for our theory we only barely
manage to avoid an overlarge anomaly in the indirect charge conjugation parity violation parameter
epsilon. Our modified model also predicts an anomalous contribution to the meson long to meson short
mass difference of the same order of magnitude as the experimental value, which is consistent with
the deviation from the standard model lattice value.
