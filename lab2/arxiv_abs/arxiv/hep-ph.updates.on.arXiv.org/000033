Most of the traditional Technicolor-based models are known to be in a strong tension with the electroweak
precision data. We show that this serious issue is naturally cured in strongly coupled sectors with
chiral-symmetric vector-like gauge interactions in the framework of gauged linear sigma model.
We discuss possible phenomenological implications of such non-standard chiral-symmetric Technicolor
scenario in its simplest formulation preserving the standard Higgs mechanism and (possibly) elementary
Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). For this purpose, we assume the existence of an extra technifermion
sector confined under extra SU(3)_TC at the energy scales reachable at the LHC, Lambda_TC ~ 0.1-1
TeV, and interacting with the SM gauge bosons in a chiral-symmetric (vector-like) way. In the framework
of this scenario, the SM Higgs vev acquires natural interpretation in terms of the condensate of
technifermions in confinement. We study the influence of the lowest lying composite physical states,
namely, technipions, technisigma and constituent technifermions, on the Higgs sector properties
in the SM and other observables at the LHC. We found out that the predicted Higgs boson signal strengths
in gamma gamma, vector-boson VV^* and fermion ffbar decay channels can, in principle, be sensitive
to the new strongly-coupled dynamics and are consistent with the current SM-like Higgs boson observations
in the limit of relatively small Higgs-technisigma mixing. At the same time, the chiral-symmetric
Technicolor provides rich technipion and technisigma phenomenology at the LHC, and its major implications
are discussed in detail.
