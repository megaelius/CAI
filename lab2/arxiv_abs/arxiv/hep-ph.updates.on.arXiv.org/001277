The swampland distance conjecture (SDC) addresses the ability of effective field theory to describe
distant points in moduli space. It is natural to ask whether there is a local version of the SDC: is
it possible to construct local excitations in an EFT that sample extreme regions of moduli space?
In many cases such excitations exhibit horizons or instabilities, suggesting that there are bounds
on the size and structure of field excitations that can be achieved in EFT. Static bubbles in ordinary
Kaluza-Klein theory provide a simple class of examples: the KK radius goes to zero on a smooth surface,
locally probing an infinite distance point, and the bubbles are classically unstable against radial
perturbations. However, it is also possible to stabilize KK bubbles at the classical level by adding
flux. We study the impact of imposing the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) on these solutions, finding
that a rapid pair production instability arises in the presence of charged matter with $q/m\gtrsim
1$. We also analyze 4d electrically charged dilatonic black holes. Small curvature at the horizon
imposes a bound $\log(M_{BH})\gtrsim |\Delta\phi|$, independent of the WGC, and the bound can
be strengthened if the particle satisfying the WGC is sufficiently light. We conjecture that quantum
gravity in asymptotically flat space requires a general bound on large localized moduli space excursions
of the form $ |\Delta\phi|\lesssim |\log(R\Lambda)|$, where $R$ is the size of the minimal region
enclosing the excitation and $\Lambda^{-1}$ is the short-distance cutoff on local EFT. The bound
is qualitatively saturated by the dilatonic black holes and Kaluza-Klein monopoles.
