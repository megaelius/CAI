Recently, DAMPE has released its first results on the high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons
(CREs) from about $25$ GeV to $4.6$ TeV, which directly detect a break at $\sim 1$ TeV. This result
gives us an excellent opportunity to study the source of the CREs excess. In this work, we used the
data fo proton and helium flux (from AMS-02 and CREAM), $\bar{\mathrm{p}}/\mathrm{p}$ ratio (from
AMS-02), positron flux (from AMS-02) and CREs flux (from DAMPE without the peak signal point at $\sim
1.4$ TeV) to do global fitting simultaneously, which can account the influence from the propagation
model, the nuclei and electron primary source injection and the secondary lepton production precisely.
For extra source to interpret the excess in lepton spectrum, we consider two separate scenarios
(pulsar and dark matter annihilation via leptonic channels) to construct the bump ($\gtrsim 100$
GeV) and the break at $\sim 1$ TeV. The result shows: (i) in pulsar scenario, the spectral index of
the injection should be $\nu_{\mathrm{psr}} \sim 0.65$ and the cut-off should be $R_{c} \sim 650$
GV; (ii) in dark matter scenario, the dark matter particle's mass is $m_{\chi} \sim 1208$ GeV and
the cross section is $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 1.48 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{cm}^{3} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
Moreover, in the dark matter scenario, the $\tau \bar{\tau}$ annihilation channel is highly suppressed.
Furthermore, we present two simple dark matter models to explain the DAMPE results by introducing
an SM singlet scalar $S$ as dark matter particle. In one model, we introduce a doublet scalar $H'$
as a mediator, while in the other model we introduce a pair of vector-like fermions $(XE, XE^c)$.
In these models, the real scalar dark matter can annihilate dominantly into the charged lepton pairs.
