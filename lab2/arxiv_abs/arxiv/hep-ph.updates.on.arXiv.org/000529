The particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions seems to be created in a dynamically
disordered system which can be best described by an extended exponential entropy. In distinguishing
between the applicability of this and Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) in generating various particle-ratios,
generic (non)extensive statistics (GNS) is introduced to the hadron resonance gas model. Accordingly,
the degree of (non)extensivity is determined by the possible modifications in the phase space.
Both BG extensivity and Tsallis nonextensivity are included as very special cases defined by specific
values of the equivalence classes $(c, d)$. We found that the particle ratios at energies ranging
between $3.8$ and $2760~$GeV are best reproduced by nonextensive statistics, where $c$ and $d$
range between $\sim0.9$ and $\sim1$. The present work aims at illustrating that the proposed approach
is well capable to manifest the statistical nature of the system on interest. We don't aim at highlighting
deeper physical insights. In other words, while the resulting nonextensivity is neither BG nor
Tsallis, the freezeout parameters are found very compatible with BG and accordingly with the well-known
freezeout phase-diagram, which is in an excellent agreement with recent lattice calculations.
We conclude that the particle production is nonextensive but should not necessarily be accompanied
by a radical change in the intensive or extensive thermodynamic quantities, such as internal energy
and temperature. Only, the two critical exponents defining the equivalence classes $(c, d)$ are
the physical parameters characterizing the (non)extensivity.
