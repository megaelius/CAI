We study the implications of the Planck temperature power spectrum at low multipoles, $\ell<1000$,
and SPTPol data. We show that this combination predicts consistent lensing-induced smoothing
of acoustic peaks within $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and yields the robust predictions of the cosmological
parameters. Combining only the Planck large-scale temperature data and the SPTPol polarization
and lensing measurements within $\Lambda$CDM model we found substantially lower values of linear
matter density perturbation $\sigma_8$ which bring the late-time parameter $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.763\pm0.022$
into accordance with galaxy clustering and weak lensing measurements. It also raises up the Hubble
constant $H_0=69.68\pm1.00{\rm \,\,km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ that reduces the Hubble tension to
the $2.5\sigma$ level. We examine the residual tension in the Early Dark Energy (EDE) model which
produces the brief energy injection prior to recombination. We implement both the background and
perturbation evolutions of the scalar field which potential scales as $V(\phi)\propto \phi^{2n}$.
Including cosmic shear measurements (KiDS, VIKING-450, DES) and local distance-ladder data (SH0ES)
to the combined fit we found that EDE completely alleviates the Hubble tension while not degradating
the fit to large-scale structure data. The EDE scenario significantly improves the goodness-of-fit
by $2.9\sigma$ in comparison with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. The account for the intermediate-redshift
data (the supernova dataset and baryon acoustic oscillation data) fits perfectly to our parameter
predictions and indicates the preference of EDE over $\Lambda$CDM at $3\sigma$.
