Strong gravitational lensing has been identified as a promising astrophysical probe to study the
particle nature of dark matter. In this paper we present a detailed study of the power spectrum of
the projected mass density (convergence) field of substructure in a Milky Way-sized halo. This
power spectrum has been suggested as a key observable that can be extracted from strongly lensed
images and yield important clues about the matter distribution within the lens galaxy. We use two
different $N$-body simulations from the ETHOS framework: one with cold dark matter and another
with self-interacting dark matter and a cutoff in the initial power spectrum. Despite earlier works
that identified $ k \gtrsim 100$ kpc$^{-1}$ as the most promising scales to learn about the particle
nature of dark matter we find that even at lower wavenumbers - which are actually within reach of observations
in the near future - we can gain important information about dark matter. Comparing the amplitude
and slope of the power spectrum on scales $0.1 \lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1} \lesssim 10$ from lenses at
different redshifts can help us distinguish between cold dark matter and other exotic dark matter
scenarios that alter the abundance and central densities of subhalos. Furthermore, by considering
the contribution of different mass bins to the power spectrum we find that subhalos in the mass range
$10^7 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ are on average the largest contributors to the power spectrum signal on
scales $2 \lesssim k/$kpc$^{-1} \lesssim 15$, despite the numerous subhalos with masses $> 10^8$
M$_{\odot}$ in a typical lens galaxy. Finally, by comparing the power spectra obtained from the
subhalo catalogs to those from the particle data in the simulation snapshots we find that the seemingly-too-simple
halo model is in fact a fairly good approximation to the much more complex array of substructure in
the lens.
