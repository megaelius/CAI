Evolution of spatially anisotropic perturbation created in the system formed after Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collisions has been studied. The microscopic evolution of the fluctuations has been examined
within the ambit of Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) in a hydrodynamically expanding background.
The expansion of the background composed of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is treated within the framework
of relativistic hydrodynamics. Spatial anisotropic fluctuations with different geometry have
been evolved through Boltzmann equation. It is observed that the trace of such fluctuation survive
the evolution. Within the relaxation time approximation analytical results have been obtained
for the evolution of these anisotropies. Explicit relations between fluctuations and transport
coefficients have been derived. The mixing of various Fourier (or $k$) modes of the perturbations
during the evolution of the system has been explicitly demonstrated. This study is very useful in
understanding the presumption that the measured anisotropies in the data from heavy ion collisions
at relativistic energies imitate the initial state effects. The evolution of correlation function
for the perturbation in pressure has been studied and shown that the initial correlation between
two neighbouring points in real space evolves to a constant value at later time which gives rise to
Dirac delta function for the correlation function in Fourier space. The power spectrum of the fluctuation
in thermodynamic quantities (like temperature estimated in this work) can be connected to the fluctuation
in transverse momentum of the thermal hadrons measured experimentally. The bulk viscous coefficient
of the QGP has been estimated by using correlations of pressure fluctuation with the help of Green-Kubo
relation. Angular power spectrum of the anisotropies has been estimated in the appendix.
