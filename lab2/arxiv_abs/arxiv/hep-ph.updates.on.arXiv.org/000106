The ${}_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{\ \ 4}$H bound state and the $S$-wave hypertriton(${}_\Lambda^{\,
3}$H)-$\Lambda$ scattering in spin singlet and triplet channels below the hypertriton breakup
momentum scale are studied in halo/cluster effective field theory at leading order by treating
the ${}_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{\ \ 4}$H system as a three-cluster ($\Lambda$-$\Lambda$-deuteron)
system. In the spin singlet channel, we find that the scattering length and phase shift can be described
by the effective range parameters of the $S$-wave deuteron-$\Lambda$ scattering in the hypertriton
channel. On the other hand, in the spin triplet channel, we find that the integral equations exhibit
a limit-cycle and shows a sensitivity to the momentum cutoff parameter $\Lambda_c$. We then introduce
the three-body contact-interaction and investigate its role in the ${}_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{\
\ 4}$H system. Because of the lack of empirical information, we employ the potential model calculations
to constrain the strength of the contact-interaction. When the three-body contact-interaction
is absent, the system is found to have a negative large scattering length, which implies a formation
of a quasi-bound state. With the three-body contact interaction whose strength is determined by
potential model calculations, we study the correlations between the two-$\Lambda$ separation
energy $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$ of ${}_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{\ \ 4}$H and the scattering length $a_1^{}$
of the hypertriton-$\Lambda$ scattering and their dependence on the cutoff momentum. The correlation
between $B_{\Lambda\Lambda}$ of ${}_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{\ \ 4}$H and the scattering length $a_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{}$
of $\Lambda\Lambda$ scattering in $^1S_0$ channel is also studied.
