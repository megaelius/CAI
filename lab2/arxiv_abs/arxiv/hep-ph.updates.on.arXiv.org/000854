In this work we advocate for the idea that two seemingly unrelated 80-year-old mysteries - the nature
of dark matter and the high temperature of the million degree solar corona - may have resolutions
that lie within the same physical framework. The current paradigm is that the corona is heated by
nanoflares, which were originally proposed as miniature versions of the observed solar flares.
It was recently suggested that the nanoflares could be identified as annihilation events of the
nuggets from the Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model. This model was invented as an explanation
of the observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$, based only on cosmological
and particle physics considerations. In this new paradigm, the AQN particles moving through the
coronal plasma and annihilating with normal matter can lead to the drastic change of temperatures
seen in the Sun's Transition Region (TR), and significantly contribute to the extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) excess of $10^{27}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. To test this proposal, we perform numerical simulations
with a realistically modeled AQN particle distribution and explore how the nuggets interact with
the coronal plasma. Remarkably, our simulations predict the correct energy budget for the solar
corona, and show that the energy injection mostly occurs at an altitude of around 2000 km, which is
where the TR lies. Therefore, we propose that these long unresolved mysteries could be two sides
of the same coin. We make several predictions based on this proposal, some of which could be tested
by the recently launched NASA mission, the Parker Solar Probe.
