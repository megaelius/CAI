The full quark-gluon vertex is a crucial ingredient for the dynamical generation of a constituent
quark mass from the standard quark gap equation, and its non-transverse part may be determined exactly
from the nonlinear Slavnov-Taylor identity that it satisfies. The resulting expression involves
not only the quark propagator, but also the ghost dressing function and the quark-ghost kernel,
and constitutes the non-abelian extension of the so-called "Ball-Chiu vertex", known from QED.
In the present work we carry out a detailed study of the impact of this vertex on the gap equation and
the quark masses generated from it, putting particular emphasis on the contributions directly
related with the ghost sector of the theory, and especially the quark-ghost kernel. In particular,
we set up and solve the coupled system of six equations that determine the four form factors of the
latter kernel and the two typical Dirac structures composing the quark propagator. Due to the incomplete
implementation of the multiplicative renormalizability at the level of the gap equation, the correct
anomalous dimension of the quark mass is recovered through the inclusion of a certain function,
whose ultraviolet behavior is fixed, but its infrared completion is unknown; three particular
Ans\"atze for this function are considered, and their effect on the quark mass and the pion decay
constant is explored. The main results of this study indicate that the numerical impact of the quark-ghost
kernel is considerable; the transition from a tree-level kernel to the one computed here leads to
a $20\%$ increase in the value of the quark mass at the origin. Particularly interesting is the contribution
of the fourth Ball-Chiu form factor, which, contrary to the abelian case, is nonvanishing, and accounts
for $10\%$ of the total constituent quark mass.
