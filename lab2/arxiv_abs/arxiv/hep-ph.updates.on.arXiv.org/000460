The recent measurement of $R_{K^*} \equiv \Gamma (B^0 \to K^{*0} \mu^+\mu^-)/\Gamma(B^0 \to K^{*0}
e^+ e^-)$ by LHCb collaboration along with the previous measurements of $R_K \equiv \Gamma(B^+
\to K^+ \,\mu^+\,\mu^-)/\Gamma(B^+ \to K^+\,e^+\,e^-)$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}\equiv \Gamma(B \to
D^{(*)}\, \tau \bar{\nu})/\Gamma(B \to D^{(*)}\, l \bar{\nu})$ $(l=e,\,\mu)$ hint towards lepton
flavor non universality. In this work we look for the simultaneous explanations of these measurements
in standard model like vector bosons (VB), $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector leptoquark ($U_1$), $SU(2)_L$-triplet
scalar leptoquark ($S_3$) and $SU(2)_L$ triplet vector leptoquark ($U_3$) models. We study these
models assuming a coupling only to the third generation in the gauge basis. We first perform a global
fit to all relevant data in the $B$ sector. We find that the vector boson model violates the current
upper bound on the branching ratio of $\tau \to 3\mu$ and hence is inconsistent with the present data.
The remaining three models, $U_1$, $U_3$ and $S_3$, cannot simultaneously accommodate $R_{K^{(*)}}$
and $R_{D^{(*)}}$ within 1$\sigma$, they can only explain the $R_{K^{(*)}}$ measurement. The
central values of $R_{K^{(*)}}$ in the central dilepton invariant mass-squared $q^2$ range ($1.0
\le q^2 \le 6.0 \, {\rm GeV}^2$), for these three models lies within 1 $\sigma$ experimental range.
We then perform fits with only $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ data and find that $U_1$, $S_3$ and $U_3$ can accommodate
$R_{K^{(*)}}$ data within 1 $\sigma$ except $R_{K^{*}}$ in the $q^2 $ range (0.045, 1.1). Further
in this case the agreement of $R_{D^{(*)}}$ for all these models become worse at the best fit point,
which can be an indication of $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ data not confronting $R_{D^{(*)}}$ within this
framework.
