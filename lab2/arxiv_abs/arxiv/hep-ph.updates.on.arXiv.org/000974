A non-perturbative lattice regularization of chiral fermions and bosons with anomaly-free symmetry
$G$ in 1+1D spacetime is proposed. More precisely, we ask "whether there is a local short-range quantum
Hamiltonian with a finite Hilbert space for a finite system realizing onsite symmetry $G$ defined
on a 1D spatial lattice with continuous time, such that its low energy physics produces a 1+1D anomaly-free
chiral matter theory of symmetry $G$?" In particular, we show that the 3$_L$-5$_R$-4$_L$-0$_R$
U(1) chiral fermion theory, with two left-moving fermions of charge-3 and 4, and two right-moving
fermions of charge-5 and 0 at low energy, can be put on a 1D spatial lattice where the U(1) symmetry
is realized as an onsite symmetry, if we include properly designed multi-fermion interactions
with intermediate strength. In general, we propose that any 1+1D U(1)-anomaly-free chiral matter
theory can be defined as a finite system on a 1D lattice with onsite symmetry by using a quantum Hamiltonian
with continuous time, but without suffered from Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem's fermion-doubling,
if we include properly-designed interactions between matter fields. We propose how to design such
interactions by looking for extra symmetries via bosonization/fermionization. We comment on
the new ingredients and the differences of ours compared to Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, Eichten-Preskill,
and Chen-Giedt-Poppitz (CGP) models, and suggest modifying CGP model to have successful mirror-decoupling.
As an additional remark, we show a topological non-perturbative proof on the equivalence relation
between the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions and the boundary fully gapping rules (e.g. Haldane's
stability conditions for Luttinger liquid) of U(1) symmetry. Our proof holds universally independent
from Hamiltonian or Lagrangian/path integral formulation of quantum theory.
