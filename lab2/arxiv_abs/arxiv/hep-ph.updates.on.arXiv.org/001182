With the advent of a new generation of neutrino experiments which leverage high-intensity neutrino
beams for precision measurements, it is timely to explore physics topics beyond the standard neutrino-related
physics. Given that the realm of beyond the standard model (BSM) physics has been mostly sought at
high-energy regimes at colliders, such as the LHC at CERN, the exploration of BSM physics in neutrino
experiments will enable complementary measurements at the energy regimes that balance that of
the LHC. This is in concert with new ideas for high-intensity beams for fixed target and beam-dump
experiments world-wide, e.g., those at CERN. The combination of the high intensity proton beam
facilities and massive detectors for precision neutrino oscillation parameter measurements
and for CP violation phase measurements will help make BSM physics reachable even in low energy regimes
in accelerator based experiments. Large mass detectors with highly precise tracking and energy
measurements, excellent timing resolution, and low energy thresholds will enable searches for
BSM phenomena from cosmogenic origin, as well. Therefore, it is conceivable that BSM topics in the
next generation neutrino experiments could be the dominant physics topics in the foreseeable future,
as the precision of the neutrino oscillation parameter and CPV measurements continues to improve.
In this spirit, this white paper provides a review of the current landscape of BSM theory in neutrino
experiments in two selected areas of the BSM topics - dark matter and neutrino related BSM - and summarizes
the current results from existing neutrino experiments to set benchmarks for both theory and experiment.
This paper then provides a review of upcoming neutrino experiments throughout the next 10 - 15 year
time scale and their capabilities to set the foundation for potential reach in BSM physics in the
two aforementioned themes.
