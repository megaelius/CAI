We present the first lattice $N_f=2+1+1$ determination of the tensor form factor $f_T^{D \pi(K)}(q^2)$
corresponding to the semileptonic $D \to \pi(K) \ell \nu_\ell$ decays as a function of the squared
four-momentum transfer $q^2$. Together with our recent determination of the vector and scalar
form factors we complete the set of hadronic matrix elements regulating the semileptonic $D \to
\pi(K)$ transition within and beyond the Standard Model, where a non-zero tensor coupling is possible.
Our analysis is based on the gauge configurations produced by ETMC with $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of dynamical
quarks, which include three different values of the lattice spacing and pion masses as small as 220
MeV. The matrix elements of the tensor current are determined for a plethora of kinematical conditions
in which parent and child mesons are either moving or at rest. As in the case of the vector and scalar
form factors, Lorentz symmetry breaking due to hypercubic effects is clearly observed also in the
data for the tensor form factor and included in the decomposition of the current matrix elements
in terms of additional form factors. After the extrapolations to the physical pion mass and to the
continuum and infinite volume limits we determine the tensor form factor in the whole kinematical
region accessible in the experiments. A set of synthetic data points for $f_T^{D \pi(K)}(q^2)$
at several selected values of $q^2$ is provided and the corresponding covariance matrix is also
available. At $q^2=0$ we get $f_T^{D \pi}(0) = 0.506(79)$ and $f_T^{D K}(0) = 0.687(54)$, which
correspond to $f_T^{D \pi}(0)/f_+^{D \pi}(0) = 0.827(114)$ and $f_T^{D K}(0)/f_+^{D K}(0)= 0.898(50)$.
