Primordial Black Holes (PBH) arise naturally from high peaks in the curvature power spectrum of
near-inflection-point single-field inflation, and could constitute today the dominant component
of the dark matter in the universe. In this letter we explore the possibility that a broad spectrum
of PBH is formed in models of Critical Higgs Inflation (CHI), where the near-inflection point is
related to the critical value of the RGE running of both the Higgs self-coupling $\lambda(\mu)$
and its non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi(\mu)$. We show that, for a wide range of model parameters,
a half-domed-shaped peak in the matter spectrum arises at sufficiently small scales that it passes
all the constraints from large scale structure observations. The predicted cosmic microwave background
spectrum at large scales is in agreement with Planck 2015 data, and has a relatively large tensor-to-scalar
ratio that may soon be detected by B-mode polarization experiments. Moreover, the wide peak in the
power spectrum gives an approximately lognormal PBH distribution in the range of masses $0.01 -
100\,M_\odot$, which could explain the LIGO merger events, while passing all present PBH observational
constraints. The stochastic background of gravitational waves coming from the unresolved black-hole-binary
mergers could also be detected by LISA or PTA. Furthermore, the parameters of the CHI model are consistent,
within $2\sigma$, with the measured Higgs parameters at the LHC and their running. Future measurements
of the PBH mass spectrum could allow us to obtain complementary information about the Higgs couplings
at energies well above the EW scale, and thus constrain new physics beyond the Standard Model.
