Cosmic-ray antiprotons represent an important channel for dark matter indirect-detection studies.
Current measurements of the antiproton flux at the top of the atmosphere and theoretical determinations
of the secondary antiproton production in the Galaxy are in good agreement, with no manifest deviation
which could point to an exotic contribution in this channel. Therefore, antiprotons can be used
as a powerful tool for constraining particle dark matter properties. By using the spectrum of PAMELA
data from 50 MV to 180 GV in rigidity, we derive bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section
(or decay rate, for decaying dark matter) for the whole spectrum of dark matter annihilation (decay)
channels and under different hypotheses of cosmic-rays transport in the Galaxy and in the heliosphere.
For typical models of galactic propagation, the constraints are significantly strong, setting
a lower bound on the dark matter mass of a "thermal" relic at about 50 -- 90 GeV for hadronic annihilation
channels. These bounds are enhanced to about 150 GeV on the dark matter mass, when large cosmic-rays
confinement volumes in the Galaxy are considered, and are reduced to 4-5 GeV for annihilation to
light quarks (no bound for heavy-quark production) when the confinement volume is small. Bounds
for dark matter lighter than few tens of GeV are due to the low energy part of the PAMELA spectrum, an
energy region where solar modulation is relevant: to this aim, we have implemented a detailed solution
of the transport equation in the heliosphere, which allowed us not only to extend bounds to light
dark matter, but also to determine the uncertainty on the constraints arising from solar modulation
modeling. Finally, we estimate the impact of soon-to-come AMS-02 data on the antiproton constraints.
