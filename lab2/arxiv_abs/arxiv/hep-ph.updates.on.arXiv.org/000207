The predicted Standard Model (SM) electric dipole moments (EDMs) of electrons and quarks are tiny,
providing an important window to observe new physics. Theories beyond the SM typically allow relatively
large EDMs. The EDMs depend on the relative phases of terms in the effective Lagrangian of the extended
theory, which are generally unknown. Underlying theories, such as string/M-theories compactified
to four dimensions, could predict the phases and thus EDMs in the resulting supersymmetric (SUSY)
theory. Earlier one of us, with collaborators, made such a prediction and found, unexpectedly,
that the phases were predicted to be zero at tree level in the theory at the unification or string scale
$\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{16}$ GeV). Electroweak (EW) scale EDMs still arise via running from the
high scale, and depend only on the SM Yukawa couplings that also give the CKM phase. Here we extend
the earlier work by studying the dependence of the low scale EDMs on the constrained but not fully
known fundamental Yukawa couplings. The dominant contribution is from two loop diagrams and is
not sensitive to the choice of Yukawa texture. The electron EDM should not be found to be larger than
about $ 5\times 10^{-30} e$ cm, and the neutron EDM should not be larger than about $5\times 10^{-29}e$
cm. These values are quite a bit smaller than the reported predictions from Split SUSY and typical
effective theories, but much larger than the Standard Model prediction. Also, since models with
random phases typically give much larger EDMs, it is a significant testable prediction of compactified
M-theory that the EDMs should not be above these upper limits. The actual EDMs can be below the limits,
so once they are measured they could provide new insight into the fundamental Yukawa couplings of
leptons and quarks. We comment also on the role of strong CP violation. EDMs probe fundamental physics
near the Planck scale.
