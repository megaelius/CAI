In this paper, we recast a "stealth stop" search in the notoriously difficult region of the stop-neutralino
Simplified Model parameter space for which $m(\tilde{t}) - m(\tilde{\chi}) \simeq m_t$. The properties
of the final state are nearly identical for tops and stops, while the rate for stop pair production
is $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of that for $t\bar{t}$. Stop searches away from this stealth region have
left behind a "splinter" of open parameter space when $m(\tilde{t}) \simeq m_t$. Removing this
splinter requires surgical precision: the ATLAS constraint on stop pair production reinterpreted
here treats the signal as a contaminant to the measurement of the top pair production cross section
using data from $\sqrt{s} = 7 \text{ TeV}$ and $8 \text{ TeV}$ in a correlated way to control for some
systematic errors. ATLAS fixed $m(\tilde{t}) \simeq m_t$ and $m(\tilde{\chi})= 1 \text{ GeV}$,
implying that a careful recasting of these results into the full $m(\tilde{t}) - m(\tilde{\chi})$
plane is warranted. We find that the parameter space with $m(\tilde{\chi})\lesssim 55 \text{ GeV}$
is excluded for $m(\tilde{t}) \simeq m_t$ --- although this search does cover new parameter space,
it is unable to fully pull the splinter. Along the way, we review a variety of interesting physical
issues in detail: (i) when the two-body width is a good approximation; (ii) what the impact on the
total rate from taking the narrow width is a good approximation; (iii) how the production rate is
affected when the wrong widths are used; (iv) what role the spin correlations play in the limits.
In addition, we provide a guide to using MadGraph for implementing the full production including
finite width and spin correlation effects, and we survey a variety of pitfalls one might encounter.
