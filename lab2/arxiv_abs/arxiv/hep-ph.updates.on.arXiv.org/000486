We consider two theoretical scenarios, each including a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-odd sector and leading
to an elementary dark matter candidate. The first one is a variant of the Type-III seesaw model where
one lepton triplet is $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-odd, together with a heavy sterile neutrino. It leads to
a fermionic dark matter, together with the charged component of the triplet being a quasi-stable
particle which decays only via a higher-dimensional operator suppressed by a high scale. The second
model consists of an inert scalar doublet together with a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-odd right-handed Majorana
neutrino dark matter. A tiny Yukawa coupling delays the decay of the charged component of the inert
doublet into the dark matter candidate, making the former long-lived on the scale of collider detectors.
The parameter space of each model has been constrained by big-bang nucleosynthesis constraints,
and also by estimating the contribution to the relic density through freeze-out of the long-lived
charged particle as well the freeze-in production of the dark matter candidate. We consider two
kinds of signals at the Large Hadron Collider for the first kind of models, namely two charged tracks
and single track + MET. For the second kind, the characteristic signals are opposite as well as same-sign
charged track pairs. We perform a detailed analysis using event selection criteria consistent
with the current experimental programmes. It is found that the scenario with a lepton triplet can
be probed upto 960(1190) GeV with an integrated luminosity of 300(3000) $fb^{-1}$, while the corresponding
numbers for the inert doublet scenario are 630(800) GeV. Furthermore, the second kind of signal
mentioned in each case allows us to differentiate different dark matter scenarios from each other.
