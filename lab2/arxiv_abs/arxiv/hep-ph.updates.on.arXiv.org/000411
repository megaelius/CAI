A continuum approach to the three valence-quark bound-state problem in quantum field theory is
used to perform a comparative study of the four lightest $(I=1/2,J^P = 1/2^\pm)$ baryon isospin-doublets
in order to elucidate their structural similarities and differences. Such analyses predict the
presence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark) correlations
within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar, isovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar,
and vector diquarks can all play a role. In the two lightest $(1/2,1/2^+)$ doublets, however, scalar
and pseudovector diquarks are overwhelmingly dominant. The associated rest-frame wave functions
are largely $S$-wave in nature; and the first excited state in this $1/2^+$ channel has the appearance
of a radial excitation of the ground state. The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different
picture: accurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector diquarks;
in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark cores contain roughly equal
fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the associated wave functions are predominantly
$P$-wave in nature, but possess measurable $S$-wave components. Moreover, the first excited state
in each negative-parity channel has little of the appearance of a radial excitation. In quantum
field theory, all differences between positive- and negative-parity channels must owe to chiral
symmetry breaking, which is overwhelmingly dynamical in the light-quark sector. Consequently,
experiments that can validate the contrasts drawn herein between the structure of the four lightest
$(1/2,1/2^\pm)$ doublets will prove valuable in testing links between emergent mass generation
and observable phenomena and, plausibly, thereby revealing dynamical features of confinement.
