We study the fluctuation theory analysis of multiple soft interactions that are used to design SIBYLL
2.1 and related cosmic ray event generators. We examine fluctuation stabilities of Lund string
fragmentation involving quark-antiquark and diquark-antidiquark pairs. Using the primordial
transverse momentum hadron-hadron pairs, we find that the resulting Gaussian distribution yields
an ill-defined ensemble under fluctuation of the model parameters of parent quark and diquarks.
Further, we investigate the nature of multiple soft interactions through Pomeron-Reggeon fluctuations
at various energy scales. We show that there are both stable and unstable regions under fluctuations
of the Reggeon and Pomeron densities and all initial energy scales. The optimal stability zone is
achieved at the Reggeon and Pomeron densities as predicted by GRV model. For hadron-hadron collisions,
the limiting Gaussian profile as a function of the impact parameters of soft interactions for proton-proton
collisions corresponds to an indeterminate statistical basis. Subsequently, we add higher order
corrections in the Regge trajectory of constituent hadrons that play an important role in determining
the shape of a proton or meson profile function in the realm of minijet model. We also discuss the accelerated
nucleons with jerks and soft profile functions at off-shell-conditions. In addition, we illustrate
the wall of stability/instability for multiple soft interactions by considering energy dependent
soft contributions to scattering cross section as the model embedding. Qualitative discussions
are provided at physical energy scales ranging from 1 GeV to 1800 GeV. This includes the analysis
of CDF, P238, UA5 and ZEUS experiments.
