In arXiv:1705.00745, an initial state "parton model" of quarks scattering off a dense nuclear target
was shown to qualitatively reproduce the systematics of multiparticle azimuthal anisotropy cumulants
measured in proton/deuteron-nucleus ($pA$) collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The systematics included
i) the behavior of the four-particle cumulant $c_2\{4\}$, which generates a real four-particle
second Fourier harmonic $v_2\{4\}$, ii) the ordering $v_2\{2\}>v_2\{4\}\approx v_2\{6\}\approx
v_2\{8\}$ for two-, four-, six-, and eight-particle Fourier harmonics, iii) the behavior of so-called
symmetric cumulants $\text{SC}(2,3)$ and $\text{SC}(2,4)$. These features of azimuthal multiparticle
cumulants were previously interpreted as a signature of hydrodynamic flow; our results challenge
this interpretation. We expand here upon our previous study and present further details and novel
results on the saturation scale and transverse momentum ($p_\perp$) dependence of multiparticle
azimuthal correlations. We find that the dependence of $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$ on the number
of color domains in the target varies with the $p_\perp$ window explored. We extend our prior discussion
of symmetric cumulants and compute as yet unmeasured symmetric cumulants. We investigate the $N_c$
dependence of $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$. We contrast our results, which include multiple scatterings
of each quark off the target, to the Glasma graph approximation, where each quark suffers at most
two gluon exchanges with the target. We find that coherent multiple scattering is essential to obtain
a positive definite $v_2\{4\}$. We provide an algorithm to compute expectation values of arbitrary
products of the "dipole" lightlike Wilson line correlators.
