We introduce new semilocal two-nucleon potentials up to fifth order in the chiral expansion. We
employ a simple regularization approach for the pion-exchange contributions which (i) maintains
the long-range part of the interaction, (ii) is implemented in momentum space and (iii) can be straightforwardly
applied to regularize many-body forces and current operators. We discuss in detail the two-nucleon
contact interactions at fourth order and demonstrate that three terms out of fifteen used in previous
calculations can be eliminated via suitably chosen unitary transformations. The removal of the
redundant contact terms results in a drastic simplification of the fits to scattering data and leads
to interactions which are much softer (i.e. more perturbative) than our recent semilocal coordinate-space
regularized potentials. Using the pion-nucleon low-energy constants from matching pion-nucleon
Roy-Steiner equations to chiral perturbation theory, we perform a comprehensive analysis of nucleon-nucleon
scattering and the deuteron properties up to fifth chiral order and study the impact of the leading
F-wave two-nucleon contact interactions which appear at sixth order. The resulting chiral potentials
lead to an outstanding description of the proton-proton and neutron-proton scattering data from
the self-consistent Granada-2013 database below the pion production threshold, which is significantly
better than for any other chiral potential. For the first time, the chiral potentials match in precision
and even outperform the available high-precision phenomenological potentials, while the number
of adjustable parameters is, at the same time, reduced by about ~40%. Last but not least, we perform
a detailed error analysis and, in particular, quantify for the first time the statistical uncertainties
of the fourth- and the considered sixth-order contact interactions.
