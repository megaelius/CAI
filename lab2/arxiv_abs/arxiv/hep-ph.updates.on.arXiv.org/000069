Vortex electrons, i.e. freely propagating electrons whose wavefunction has helical wavefronts,
could emerge as a novel tool for the physics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. They carry non-zero
intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) $\ell$ and, for $\ell \gg 1$, a large OAM-induced magnetic
moment, $\mu \approx \ell \mu_B$ ($\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton), which affects the radiation of
EM waves. Here, we consider in detail its influence on two forms of polarization radiation, namely
on Cherenkov and transition radiation. Due to large $\ell$, we can neglect quantum or spin-induced
effects, which are of order $\hbar \omega/E_e \ll 1$, but retain the magnetic moment contribution
$\ell \hbar \omega/E_e \lesssim 1$, which makes the quasiclassical approach to polarization radiation
applicable. We discuss magnetic moment contribution to polarization radiation, which has never
been experimentally observed, and study how its visibility depends on kinematical parameters
and permittivity of the medium. In particular, it is shown that this contribution can, in principle,
be detected in azimuthally non-symmetrical problems, for example when vortex electrons obliquely
cross a metallic screen (transition radiation) or move nearby it (diffraction radiation). We predict
left-right asymmetry of the transition radiation, which appears due to effective interference
between the charge and the magnetic moment radiation fields. Numerical values of this asymmetry
for vortex electrons with $E_e = 300$ keV and $\ell = {\cal O}(100-1000)$ are ${\cal O} (0.1-1%)$,
and we argue that this effect could be detected with today's technology. Finite conductivity of
the target and a frequency dispersion play the crucial roles in these predictions.
