The Standard-Model (SM) prediction for the CP-violating quantity $\epsilon_K^{\prime}/\epsilon_K$
deviates from its measured value by 2.8 $\sigma$. It has been shown that this tension can be resolved
within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) through gluino-squark box diagrams,
even if squarks and gluinos are much heavier than 1 TeV. The rare decays $K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$
and $K^+ \to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ are similarly sensitive to very high mass scales and the first one
also measures CP violation. In this article, we analyze the correlations between $\epsilon^{\prime}_K/\epsilon_K$
and $B(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})$ and $B(K^+ \to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ within the MSSM aiming
at an explanation of $\epsilon_K^{\prime}/\epsilon_K$ via gluino-squark box diagrams. The dominant
MSSM contribution to the $K \to \pi\nu\bar{\nu}$ branching fractions stems from box diagrams with
squarks, sleptons, charginos, and neutralinos, and the pattern of the correlations is different
from the widely studied $Z$-penguin scenarios. This is interesting in light of future precision
measurements by KOTO and NA62 at J-PARC and CERN, respectively. We find $B(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})/B^{SM}
(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})\lesssim 2\,(1.2)$ and $B(K^+ \to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu})/B^{SM}(K^+
\to \pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}) \lesssim 1.4\,(1.1)$, if all squark masses are above 1.5 TeV, gaugino masses
obey GUT relations, and if one allows for a fine-tuning at the $1\%\,(10\%)$ level for the gluino
mass. Larger values are possible for a tuned CP violating phase. Furthermore, the sign of the MSSM
contribution to $\epsilon_K^{\prime}$ imposes a strict correlation between $B(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})$
and the hierarchy between the masses $m_{\bar{U}}$, $m_{\bar{D}}$ of the right-handed up-squark
and down-squark: sgn$[B(K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})-B^{SM} (K_L \to \pi^0\nu\bar{\nu})] = $sgn$(m_{\bar{U}}-m_{\bar{D}})
$.
