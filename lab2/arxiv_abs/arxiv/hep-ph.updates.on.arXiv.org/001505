In this article we consider a comparative study between Type-I 2HDM and $Y=0$, $SU(2)$ triplet extensions
having one $Z_2$-odd doublet and triplet that render the desired dark matter(DM) for the respective
scenarios. For the inert doublet model (IDM) either a neutral scalar or a pseudoscalar can be a dark
matter (DM), whereas for inert triplet model (ITM) the DM candidate is a CP-even scalar. The bounds
from perturbativity and vacuum stability are studied for both the scenarios by calculating the
two-loop beta functions. While the quartic cpouplings are restricted to $0.1-0.2$ for a Planck
scale perturbativity for IDM, these are much relaxed ($0.8$ ) for ITM scenario. Later we consider
the RG-improved potential by Coleman-Weinberg to find out the regions of stability, meta-stability
and instability of the electro-weak vacuum. Contemplating the constraints coming from DM relic
and the direct-DM bounds, we realise that for IDM, the DM mass should be $\gtrsim 700$ GeV as compared
to ITM, where it is $\gtrsim 1176$ GeV for DM mass heavier than the discovered Higgs boson. The mass
gap among the various $Z_2$-odd particles can be $\mathcal{O}(M_W)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV for
IDM; whereas for ITM they are degenerate and $\mathcal{O}(166)$ MeV mass splitting comes from loop
corrections only. We calculated their decay branching fractions and the production cross-sections
for the associated Higgs-DM processes at the LHC with centre of mass energy of 14, 100 TeV. Mono-lepton
plus missing energy with prompt and displaced decays in the case of IDM and ITM can distinguish such
scenarios at the LHC along with other complementary modes.
