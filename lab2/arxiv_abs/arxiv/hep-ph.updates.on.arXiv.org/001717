Alerted by the recent LHCb discovery of exotic hadrons in the range (6.2 -- 6.9) GeV, we present new
results for the doubly-hidden scalar heavy $(\bar QQ) (Q\bar Q)$ charm and beauty molecules using
the inverse Laplace transform sum rule (LSR) within stability criteria and including the Next-to-Leading
Order (NLO) factorized perturbative and $\langle G^3\rangle$ gluon condensate corrections.
We also critically revisit and improve existing Lowest Order (LO) QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR)
estimates of the $({ \bar Q \bar Q})(QQ)$ tetraquarks analogous states. In the example of the anti-scalar-scalar
molecule, we separate explicitly the contributions of the factorized and non-factorized contributions
to LO of perturbative QCD and to the $\langle\alpha_sG^2\rangle$ gluon condensate contributions
in order to disprove some criticisms on the (mis)uses of the sum rules for four-quark currents. We
also re-emphasize the importance to include PT radiative corrections for heavy quark sum rules
in order to justify the (ad hoc) definition and value of the heavy quark mass used frequently at LO
in the literature. Our LSR results for tetraquark masses summarized in Table 2 are compared with
the ones from ratio of moments (MOM) at NLO and results from LSR and ratios of MOM at LO (Table 4). The
LHCb broad structure around (6.2 --6.7) GeV can be described by the $\overline{\eta}_{c}{\eta}_{c}$,
$\overline{J/\psi}{J/\psi}$ and $\overline{\chi}_{c1}{\chi}_{c1}$ molecules or/and their
analogue tetraquark scalar-scalar, axial-axial and vector-vector lowest mass ground states.
The peak at (6.8--6.9) GeV can be likely due to a $\overline{\chi}_{c0}{\chi}_{c0}$ molecule or/and
a pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar tetraquark state. Similar analysis is done for the scalar beauty
states whose masses are found to be above the $\eta_b\eta_b$ and $\Upsilon\Upsilon$ thresholds.
