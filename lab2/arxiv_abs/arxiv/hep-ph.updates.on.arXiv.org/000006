The exterior gravitational field of a slowly-rotating neutron star can be characterized by its
multipole moments, the first few being the neutron star mass, moment of inertia, and quadrupole
moment. In principle, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal structure,
and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy densities. We here find relations
between the moment of inertia, the Love numbers and the quadrupole moment (I-Love-Q relations)
that do not depend sensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. Such universality may
arise for two reasons: (i) these relations depend most sensitively on the internal structure far
from the core, where all realistic equations of state mostly approach each other; (ii) as the NS compactness
increases, the I-Love-Q trio approaches that of a BH, which does not have an internal-structure
dependence. Three important consequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational
astrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio would automatically
provide information about the other two, even when the latter may not be observationally accessible.
On a gravitational wave front, the I-Love-Q relations break the degeneracy between the quadrupole
moment and the neutron-star spins in binary inspiral waveforms, allowing second-generation ground-based
detectors to determine the (dimensionless) averaged spin to 0.01. On a fundamental physics front,
the I-Love-Q relations allow for tests of General Relativity in the neutron-star strong-field
that are both theory- and internal structure-independent. As an example, by combining gravitational-wave
and electromagnetic observations, one may constrain dynamical Chern-Simons gravity in the future
by more than 6 orders of magnitude more stringently than Solar System and table-top constraints.
