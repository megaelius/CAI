In this article, we construct the color-singlet-color-singlet type currents and the color-singlet-color-singlet-color-singlet
type currents to study the scalar $D^*\bar{D}^*$, $D^*D^*$ tetraquark molecular states and the
vector $D^*D^*\bar{D}^*$, $D^*D^*D^*$ hexaquark molecular states with the QCD sum rules in details.
In calculations, we choose the pertinent energy scales of the QCD spectral densities with the energy
scale formula $\mu=\sqrt{M^2_{T}-(2{\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ and $\sqrt{M^2_{H}-(3{\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$
for the tetraquark and hexaquark molecular states respectively in a consistent way. We obtain stable
QCD sum rules for the scalar $D^*\bar{D}^*$, $D^*D^*$ tetraquark molecular states and the vector
$D^*D^*\bar{D}^*$ hexaquark molecular state, but cannot obtain stable QCD sum rules for the vector
$D^*D^*D^*$ hexaquark molecular state. The connected (nonfactorizable) Feynman diagrams at
the tree level and their induced diagrams via substituting the quark lines make positive contributions
for the scalar $D^*D^*$ tetraquark molecular state, but make negative or destructive contributions
for the vector $D^*D^*D^*$ tetraquark molecular state, where the tree level denotes the lowest
order contributions shown in Figs.1-5. Lucha, Melikhov and Sazdjian assert that those nonfactorizable
Feynman diagrams can be deformed into the box diagrams. It is wrong, those nonfactorizable Feynman
diagrams can only be deformed into the box diagrams in the color space, not in the momentum space.
It is of no use or meaningless to distinguish the factorizable and nonfactorizable properties of
the Feynman diagrams in the color space in the operator product expansion so as to interpret them
in terms of the hadronic observables, we can only obtain information about the short-distance and
long-distance contributions.
