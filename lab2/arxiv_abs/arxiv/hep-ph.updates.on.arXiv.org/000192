The improved QCD light-cone sum rule (LCSR) provides an effective way to deal with the heavy-to-light
transition form factors (TFFs). Firstly, we adopt the improved LCSR approach to deal with the $B\to
D$ TFF $f^{+}(q^2)$ up to twist-4 accuracy. Due to the elimination of the most uncertain twist-3
contribution and the large suppression of the twist-4 contribution, the obtained LCSR shall provide
us a good platform for testing the $D$-meson leading-twist DA. For the purpose, we suggest a new model
for the $D$-meson leading-twist DA ($\phi_{3D}$), whose longitudinal behavior is dominantly
determined by a parameter $B$. Moreover, we find its second Gegenbauer moment $a^D_2\sim B$. Varying
$B$ within certain region, one can conveniently mimic the $D$-meson DA behavior suggested in the
literature. Inversely, by comparing the estimations with the experimental data on the $D$-meson
involved processes, one can get a possible range for the parameter $B$ and a determined behavior
for the $D$-meson DA. Secondly, we discuss the $B\to D$ TFF at the maximum recoil region and present
a detailed comparison of it with the pQCD estimation and the experimental measurements. Thirdly,
by applying the LCSR on $f^{+}(q^2)$, we study the CKM matrix element $\Vcb$ together with its uncertainties
by adopting two types of processes, i.e. the $B^0/\bar{B}^0$-type and the $B^{\pm}$-type. It is
noted that a smaller $B \precsim 0.20$ shows a better agreement with the experimental value on $\Vcb$.
For example, for the case of $B=0.00$, we obtain $|V_{cb}|(B^0/\bar{B}^0-{\rm type})=(41.28
{^{+5.68}_{-4.82}} {^{+1.13}_{-1.16}}) \times 10^{-3}$ and $|V_{cb}|(B^{\pm}-{\rm type})=(40.44
{^{+5.56}_{-4.72}} {^{+0.98}_{-1.00}}) \times 10^{-3}$, whose first (second) uncertainty
comes from the squared average of the mentioned theoretical (experimental) uncertainties.
