Recently, a tetraquark mixing framework has been proposed for light mesons and applied more or less
successfully to the isovector resonances, $a_0(980), a_0(1450)$, as well as to the isodoublet
resonances, $K^*_0(800), K^*_0(1430)$. In this work, we present a more extensive view on the mixing
framework and extend this to the isoscalar resonances, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_0 (1370)$,
$f_0(1500)$. Tetraquarks in this framework can have two spin configurations containing either
spin-0 diquark or spin-1 diquark and each configuration forms a nonet in flavor space. The two spin
configurations are found to mix strongly through the color-spin interactions. Their mixtures,
which diagonalize the hyperfine masses, can generate the physical resonances constituting the
two nonets, which, in fact, coincide roughly with the experimental observation. We identify that
$f_0 (500)$, $f_0(980)$ are the isoscalar members in the light nonet, and $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0(1500)$
are the similar members in the heavy nonet. This means that the spin configuration mixing, as it relates
the corresponding members in the two nonets, can generate $f_0 (500), f_0 (1370)$ among the members
in light mass, and $f_0(980), f_0(1500)$ in heavy mass. The complication arises because the isoscalar
members of each nonet are subject to an additional flavor mixing known as OZI rule so that $f_0 (500),
f_0 (980)$, and similarly $f_0 (1370), f_0 (1500)$, are the mixture of two isoscalar members belonging
to an octet and a singlet in SU$_f$(3). The tetraquark mixing framework including the flavor mixing
is tested for the isoscalar resonances in terms of the mass splitting and the fall-apart decay modes.
