Higgs bosons - the amplitude modes - have been experimentally investigated in condensed matter
for many years. An example is superfluid $^3$He-B, where the broken symmetry leads to 4 Goldstone
modes and at least 14 Higgs modes, which are characterized by angular momentum quantum number $J$
and parity. Based on the relation $E_{J+}^2+E_{J-}^2=4\Delta^2$ for the energy spectrum of these
modes, Yoichiro Nambu proposed the general sum rule, which relates masses of Higgs bosons and masses
of fermions. If this rule is applicable to Standard Model, one may expect that the observed Higgs
boson with mass $M_{{\rm H}1}=125$ GeV has a Nambu partner -- the second Higgs boson with mass $M_{{\rm
H}2}=325$ GeV. Together they satisfy the Nambu relation $M_{{\rm H}1}^2 + M_{{\rm H}2}^2 = 4 M_{\rm
top}^2$, where $M_{\rm top}$ is the top quark mass. Also the properties of the Higgs modes in superfluid
$^3$He-A, where the symmetry breaking is similar to that of the Standard Model, suggest the possible
existence of two electrically charged Higgs particles with masses $M_{{\rm H}+}=M_{{\rm H}-}\sim
245$ GeV, which together obey the Nambu rule $M_{{\rm H}+}^2 + M_{{\rm H}-}^2 = 4 M_{\rm top}^2$.
A certain excess of events at 325 GeV and at 245 GeV has been reported in 2011, though not confirmed
in 2012 experiments. Besides, we consider the particular relativistic model of top - quark condensation
that suggests the possibility that two twice degenerated Higgs bosons contribute to the Nambu sum
rule. This gives the mass around 210 GeV for the Nambu partner of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. We also discuss
the other possible lessons from the condensed matter to Standard Model, such as hidden symmetry,
where light Higgs emerges as quasi Nambu-Goldstone mode, and the role of broken time reversal symmetry.
