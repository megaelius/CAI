Asymmetric dark matter (ADM) is motivated by the similar cosmological mass densities measured
for ordinary and dark matter. We present a comprehensive theory for ADM that addresses the mass density
similarity, going beyond the usual ADM explanations of similar number densities. It features an
explicit matter-antimatter asymmetry generation mechanism, has one fully worked out thermal
history and suggestions for other possibilities, and meets all phenomenological, cosmological
and astrophysical constraints. Importantly, it incorporates a deep reason for why the dark matter
mass scale is related to the proton mass, a key consideration in ADM models. Our starting point is
the idea of mirror matter, which offers an explanation for dark matter by duplicating the standard
model with a dark sector related by a $Z_2$ parity symmetry. However, the dark sector need not manifest
as a symmetric copy of the standard model in the present day. By utilising the mechanism of "asymmetric
symmetry breaking" with two Higgs doublets in each sector, we develop a model of ADM where the mirror
symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to an electroweak scale in the dark sector that is significantly
larger than that of the visible sector. The weak sensitivity of the ordinary and dark QCD confinement
scales to their respective electroweak scales leads to the necessary connection between the dark
matter and proton masses. The dark matter is composed of either dark neutrons or a mixture of dark
neutrons and metastable dark hydrogen atoms. Lepton asymmetries are generated by the $CP$-violating
decays of heavy Majorana neutrinos in both sectors. These are then converted by sphaleron processes
to produce the observed ratio of visible to dark matter in the universe. The dynamics responsible
for the kinetic decoupling of the two sectors emerges as an important issue that we only partially
solve.
