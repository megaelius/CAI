A novel non-minimal interaction of neutral right-handed fermion and abelian gauge field in the
covariant $\Theta$-exact noncommutative standard model (NCSM) which is invariant under Very
Special Relativity (VSR) Lorentz subgroup, opens an avenue to study the top quark pair production
at linear colliders. Here the coupling denoted as $\kappa$ and the noncommutative (NC) scale $\Lambda$.
In this work, we consider two types of analysis, one is without considering helicity basis and another,
considering helicity states of the polarized and unpolarized initial and final particles. In the
first case, when $\kappa$ is positive and for certain values of $\Lambda$, we arrived a specific
threshold value of machine energy (units of GeV) $\sqrt{s_0}$ ($ \simeq 2.52 ~\Lambda + 39$ ) may
be quite useful to probe NCSM with the unpolarized beam. The statistical $\chi^2$ analysis of the
azimuthal anisotropy is quite possible when $\kappa$ takes negative value $0 >\kappa> -0.596$
which persuade a lower limit on NC scale $\Lambda$ ($ 1.0\, \text{to} \, 2.4\,\text{TeV}$) at $\kappa_{max}=-0.296
(95\%$ C.L) according to luminosity ranging from $100\,fb^{-1} \text{to}1000\,fb^{-1}$ at machine
energy $\sqrt{s}=1.4\,\text{TeV}\,\text{and}\, 3.0\,\text{TeV}$. In another case, we performed
polarized beam analysis to probe NCSM in the light of following observables azimuthal anisotropy,
helicity correlation, and top quark helicity left-right asymmetry. The polarization of the initial
beam $\{ P_{e^{-}},P_{e^{+}}\} = \{-0.8,0.3\}( \{-0.8,0.6\})$ enhances the ranges of lower limit
on $\Lambda$, $i.e.\, 1.13 \, \text{to} \, 2.80\,\text{TeV}$ at $\kappa_{max}$ alongside the
$\kappa_{max}$ enhanced into $-0.5445 \,(-0.607)$ $95\%$C.L accord with luminosity and $\sqrt{s}$.
Finally, we studied the intriguing mixing of the UV and the IR by invoking $T(2)$ VSR Lorentz subgroup
symmetry on NC tensor $\Theta_{\mu\nu}$.
