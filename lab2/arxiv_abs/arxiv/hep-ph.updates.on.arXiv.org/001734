For many-particle systems the mass of the bound states in the continuum (BIC) is greater than the
total mass of the initial particles. BICs which are stable and not-decaying, have been found and
studied in detail in various fields of physics. But, as far as we know, in particle physics such states
have not yet been analyzed. The idea of this work is to apply the BIC phenomenon to some elementary
particles and, in particular, to the description of muons. This study focuses on a composite fermion
formed by the three charged electron-like leptons in BIC, with the mass of 207 electron masses. The
structure of the positive charged composite fermion is formed by the two positron and the electron,
$(e^{+}e^{+}e^{-})_{BIC}$, and the negatively charged composite fermion is considered as $(e^{-}e^{-}e^{+})_{BIC}$.
In this theory the free electron and free positron are treated as ordinary, different particles,
each being characterized by the complete set of the Dirac plane waves. The integral equation for
the wave function of the composite fermion is derived by using the Bethe and Salpeter equation with
account for the lowest order of the pair interaction for the three particles. An approximate solution
of this equation gave results for the massive fermion wave function that predicted the particle
radius equal to 16 fm. The representation of the muon as the composite fermion formed by the three
charged electron-like leptons in BIC, is analyzed. Only in the case of considering the electron
and positron as ordinary, different particles, the possible decay channels of this heavy composite
fermion do not contradict those for the muons.
