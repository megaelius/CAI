(abridged) Both fundamental constants that describe the laws of physics and cosmological parameters
that determine the cosmic properties must fall within a range of values in order for the universe
to develop astrophysical structures and ultimately support life. This paper reviews current constraints
on these quantities. The standard model of particle physics contains both coupling constants and
particle masses, and the allowed ranges of these parameters are discussed first. We then consider
cosmological parameters, including the total energy density, the vacuum energy density, the baryon-to-photon
ratio, the dark matter contribution, and the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations. These
quantities are constrained by the requirements that the universe lives for a long time, emerges
from the BBN epoch with an acceptable chemical composition, and can successfully produce galaxies.
On smaller scales, stars and planets must be able to form and function. The stars must have sufficiently
long lifetimes and hot surface temperatures. The planets must be massive enough to maintain an atmosphere,
small enough to remain non-degenerate, and contain enough particles to support a complex biosphere.
These requirements place constraints on the gravitational constant, the fine structure constant,
and composite parameters that specify nuclear reaction rates. We consider specific instances
of possible fine-tuning in stars, including the triple alpha reaction that produces carbon, as
well as the effects of unstable deuterium and stable diprotons. For all of these issues, viable universes
exist over a range of parameter space, which is delineated herein. Finally, for universes with significantly
different parameters, new types of astrophysical processes can generate energy and support habitability.
