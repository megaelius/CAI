Studies of charmonium properties and production mechanism started with the discovery of $J/\psi$
meson. Since more than 40 years the charmonium production mechanism is still not entirely understood.
Following the era of investigations at $e^+e^-$ machines, nowadays, charmonium states are copiously
produced at hadron colliders, that allows systematic studies of their resonance parameters, production
observables and decays. Despite large production rates, many charmonium states are barely studied
due to the complications of their reconstruction against a large background level. The LHCb experiment
provides a unique opportunity to study S-wave and P-wave charmonium states using their decays to
hadrons. This allows measuring production observables of $\eta_c$ and $\chi_c$ charmonium states.
According to the theoretical formalism of Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD), the production observables
of the same wave charmonium states are linked. Hence, the LHCb measurements provide a series of stringent
tests of NRQCD. In the framework of this thesis, the first measurement of the $\eta_c(1S)$ differential
production cross-section at $\sqrt{s}=13\,TeV$ and the most precise to date single mass measurement
are performed, where the $\eta_c(1S)$ state is reconstructed via its decay to $p\bar{p}$. In addition,
the production of the $\chi_c$ and $\eta_c(2S)$ states in $b$-hadron decays is studied using decays
to $\phi\phi$. The obtained results are confronted with existing theory predictions. The original
phenomenological analysis concludes that the description of charmonium prompt production and
production in inclusive $b$-hadron decays in an entire range of transverse momentum remains a challenge.
