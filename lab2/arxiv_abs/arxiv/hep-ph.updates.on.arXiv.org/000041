We perform a study of the flavour evolution in the early universe of a multi-flavour active-sterile
neutrino system with parameters inspired by the short-baseline neutrino anomalies. In a neutrino-symmetric
bath a "thermal" population of the sterile state would quickly grow, but in the presence of primordial
neutrino asymmetries a self-suppression as well as a resonant sterile neutrino production can
take place, depending on temperature and chosen parameters. In order to characterize these effects,
we go beyond the usual average momentum and single mixing approximations and consider a multi-momentum
and multi-flavour treatment of the kinetic equations. We find that the enhancement obtained in
this case with respect to the average momentum approximation is significant, up to \sim 20 % of a degree
of freedom. Such detailed and computationally demanding treatment further raises the asymmetry
values required to significantly suppress the sterile neutrino production, up to large and preferentially
net asymmetries |L_{\nu}| > O(10^{-2}). For such asymmetries, however, the active-sterile
flavour conversions happen so late that significant distortions are produced in the electron (anti)neutrino
spectra. The larger |L_{\nu}|, the more the impact of these distortions takes over as dominant cosmological
effect, notably increasing the 4 He abundance in primordial nucleosynthesis (BBN). The standard
expression of the primordial yields in terms of the effective number of neutrinos and asymmetries
is also greatly altered. We numerically estimate the magnitude of such effects for a few representative
cases and comment on possible implications for forthcoming cosmological measurements.
