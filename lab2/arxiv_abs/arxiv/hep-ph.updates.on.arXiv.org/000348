The Maxwell-Proca electrodynamics corresponding to a finite photon mass causes a substantial
change of the Maxwell stress tensor and, under certain circumstances, may cause the electromagnetic
stresses to act effectively as "negative pressure." The paper describes a model where this negative
pressure imitates gravitational pull and may produce forces comparable to gravity and even become
dominant. The effect is associated with the random magnetic fields in the galactic disk with a scale
exceeding the photon Compton wavelength. The presence of a weaker regular field does not affect
the forces under consideration. The stresses act predominantly on the interstellar gas and cause
an additional force pulling the gas towards the center and towards the galactic plane. The stars
do not experience any significant direct force but get involved in this process via a "recycling
loop" where rapidly evolving massive stars are formed from the gas undergoing galactic rotation
and then lose their masses back to the gas within a time shorter than roughly 1/6 of the rotation period.
This makes their dynamics inseparable from that of the rotating gas. The lighter, slowly evolving
stars, as soon as they are formed, lose connection to the gas and are confined within the galaxy only
gravitationally. Numerical examples based on the parameters of our galaxy reveal both opportunities
and challenges of this model and motivate further analysis. The critical issue is the plausibility
of formation of the irregular magnetic field that would be force free. Another challenge is developing
a predictive model of the evolution of the gaseous and stellar population of the galaxy under the
aforementioned scenario. It may be interesting to also explore possible broader cosmological
implications of the negative-pressure model.
