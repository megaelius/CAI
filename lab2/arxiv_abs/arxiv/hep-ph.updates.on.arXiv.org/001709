We analyze the recent hints of lepton flavor universality violation in both charged-current and
neutral-current rare decays of $B$-mesons in an $R$-parity violating supersymmetric scenario.
Motivated by simplicity and minimality, we had earlier postulated the third-generation superpartners
to be the lightest (calling the scenario "RPV3") and explicitly showed that it preserves gauge coupling
unification and of course has the usual attribute of naturally addressing the Higgs radiative stability.
Here we show that both $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $R_{K^{(*)}}$ flavor anomalies can be addressed in this
RPV3 framework. Interestingly, this scenario may also be able to accommodate two other seemingly
disparate anomalies, namely, the longstanding discrepancy in the muon $(g-2)$, as well as the recent
anomalous upgoing ultra-high energy ANITA events. Based on symmetry arguments, we consider three
different benchmark points for the relevant RPV3 couplings and carve out the regions of parameter
space where all (or some) of these anomalies can be simultaneously explained. We find it remarkable
that such overlap regions exist, given the plethora of precision low-energy and high-energy experimental
constraints on the minimal model parameter space. The third-generation superpartners needed
in this theoretical construction are all in the 1-10 TeV range, accessible at the LHC and/or next-generation
hadron collider. We also discuss some testable predictions for the lepton-flavor-violating decays
of the tau-lepton and $B$-mesons for the current and future $B$-physics experiments, such as LHCb
and Belle II. Complementary tests of the flavor anomalies in the high-$p_T$ regime in collider experiments
such as the LHC are also discussed.
