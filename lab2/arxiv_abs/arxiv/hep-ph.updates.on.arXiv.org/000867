We present a general study of 3-point functions of conformal field theory in momentum space, following
a reconstruction method for tensor correlators, based on the solution of the conformal Ward identities
(CWI' s), introduced in recent works by Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis (BMS). We investigate and
detail the structure of the CWI's, their non-perturbative solutions and the transition to momentum
space, comparing them to perturbation theory by taking QED as an example. We then proceed with an
analysis of the $TJJ$ correlator, presenting independent and detailed re-derivations of the conformal
equations in the reconstruction method of BMS, originally formulated using a minimal tensor basis
in the transverse traceless sector. A careful comparison with a second basis introduced in previous
studies shows that this correlator is affected by one anomaly pole in the graviton (T) line, induced
by renormalization. The result shows that the origin of the anomaly, in this correlator, should
be necessarily attributed to the exchange of a massless effective degree of freedom. Our results
are then exemplified in massless QED at one-loop in $d$-dimensions, expressed in terms of perturbative
master integrals. An independent analysis of the Fuchsian character of the solutions, which bypasses
the 3K integrals, is also presented. We show that the combination of field theories at one-loop -
with a specific field content of degenerate massless scalar and fermions - is sufficient to generate
the complete non-perturbative solution, in agreement with a previous study in coordinate space.
The result shows that free conformal field theories, in specific dimensions, arrested at one-loop,
reproduce the general result for the $TJJ$. Analytical checks of this correspondence are presented
in $d=3,4$ and $5$ spacetime dimensions[..].
