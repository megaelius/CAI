The complete next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD correction has been studied to the di-lepton
invariant mass distribution within the Randall-Sundrum (RS) framework. In addition, the soft-virtual
(SV) cross-section at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) as well as threshold resummation
to next-to-next-to leading logarithms (NNLL) level have been presented. The analytical coefficient
for SV production has been obtained up to three loops very recently along with the process-dependent
coefficients needed to perform resummation up to NNLL. These coefficients are universal for any
universal spin-2 model where spin-2 particle couples to the Standard Model (SM) particles with
equal strength. We use these coefficients in predicting N$^3$LO SV results as well as matched NNLO+NNLL
results for invariant mass distribution for Drell-Yan (DY) production in RS model. We performed
a detailed phenomenological analysis and present prediction for the 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the search of such RS Kaluza-Klein (KK) resonances. The NNLO
cross-section adds about $21\%$ correction to the next-to-leading order (NLO) results. We found
that the SV correction at the N$^3$LO order decreases the cross-section by $0.7\%$ near the first
KK resonance ($M_1=1500$ GeV) whereas the resummed result shows an increment over NNLO by $7\%$
of LO. We performed a detailed analysis including scale variation and parton distribution function
(PDF) variations. These new results provide an opportunity to stringently constrain the parameters
of the model in particular in the search of heavy spin-2 resonances at the LHC.
