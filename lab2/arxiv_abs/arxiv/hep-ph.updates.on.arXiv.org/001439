The quarks and gluons are confined objects, they cannot be put on the mass-shell, it is questionable
to apply the Landau equation to study the Feynman diagrams in the QCD sum rules. Furthermore, we carry
out the operator product expansion in the deep Euclidean region $p^2\to -\infty$, where the Landau
singularities cannot exist. The Landau equation servers as a kinematical equation in the momentum
space, and is independent on the factorizable and nonfactorizable properties of the Feynman diagrams
in the color space. The meson-meson scattering state and tetraquark molecular state both have four
valence quarks, which form two color-neutral clusters, we cannot distinguish the contributions
based on the two color-neutral clusters in the factorizable Feynman diagrams. Lucha, Melikhov
and Sazdjian assert that the contributions at the order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^k)$ with $k\leq1$
in the operator product expansion, which are factorizable in the color space, are exactly canceled
out by the meson-meson scattering states at the hadron side, the tetraquark molecular states begin
to receive contributions at the order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. Such an assertion is questionable,
we refute the assertion in details, and choose an axialvector current and a tensor current to examine
the outcome of the assertion. After detailed analysis, we observe that the meson-meson scattering
states cannot saturate the QCD sum rules, while the tetraquark molecular states can saturate the
QCD sum rules. The Landau equation is of no use to study the Feynman diagrams in the QCD sum rules for
the tetraquark molecular states, the tetraquark molecular states begin to receive contributions
at the order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^0/\alpha_s^1)$ rather than at the order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$.
