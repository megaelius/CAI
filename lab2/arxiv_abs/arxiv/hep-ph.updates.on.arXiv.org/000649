A unique feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, is the possibility
for gluonic degrees of freedom to participate in the construction of physical hadrons, which are
color singlets, in an analogous manner to valence quarks. Hadrons with no valence quarks are called
glueballs, while hadrons where both gluons and valence quarks combine to form a color singlet are
called hybrids. The unambiguous identification of such states among the experimental hadron spectrum
has been thus far not possible. Glueballs are particularly difficult to establish experimentally
since the lowest lying ones are expected to strongly mix with conventional mesons. On the other hand,
hybrids should be easier to single out because the set of quantum numbers available to their lowest
excitations may be exotic, i.e., not realized in conventional quark-antiquark systems. Particularly
promising for discovery appear to be heavy hybrids, which are made of gluons and a heavy-quark-antiquark
pair (charm or bottom). In the heavy-quark sector systematic tools can be used that are not available
in the light-quark sector. In this paper we use a nonrelativistic effective field theory to uncover
for the first time the full spin structure of heavy-quark hybrids up to $1/m^2$-terms in the heavy-quark-mass
expansion. We show that such terms display novel characteristics at variance with our consolidated
experience on the fine and hyperfine splittings in atomic, molecular and nuclear physics. We determine
the nonperturbative contributions to the matching coefficients of the effective field theory
by fitting our results to lattice-QCD determinations of the charmonium hybrid spectrum and extrapolate
the results to the bottomonium hybrid sector where lattice-QCD determinations are still challenging.
