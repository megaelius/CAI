We have studied the $P\to\gamma^\star\gamma^\star$ transition form factors ($P=\pi^0,\,\eta,\,\eta'$)
within a chiral invariant framework that allows us to relate the three form-factors and evaluate
the corresponding contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu=(g_\mu-2)/2$,
through pseudoscalar pole contributions. We use a chiral invariant Lagrangian to describe the
interactions between the pseudo-Goldstones from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and
the massive meson resonances. We will consider just the lightest vector and pseudoscalar resonance
multiplets. Photon interactions and $U(3)$ flavor breaking effects are accounted for in this covariant
framework. This article studies the most general corrections of order $m_P^2$ within this setting.
Requiring short-distance constraints fixes most of the parameters entering the form-factors,
consistent with previous determinations. The remaining ones are obtained from a fit of these form-factors
to experimental measurements in the space-like ($q^2\le0$) region of photon momenta. No time-like
observable is included in our fits. The combination of data, chiral symmetry relations between
form-factors and high-energy constraints allows us to determine with improved precision the on-shell
$P$-pole contribution to the Hadronic Light-by-Light scattering of the muon anomalous magnetic
moment: we obtain $a_{\mu}^{P,HLbL}=(8.47\pm 0.16)\cdot10^{-10}$ for our best fit. This result
was obtained excluding BaBar $\pi^0$ data, which our analysis finds in conflict with the remaining
experimental inputs. This study also allows us to determine the parameters describing the $\eta-\eta'$
system in the two-mixing angle scheme and their correlations.
