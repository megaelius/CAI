In slow collisions of two bare nuclei with the total charge number larger than the critical value,
$Z_{\rm cr} \approx 173$, the initially neutral vacuum can spontaneously decay into the charged
vacuum and two positrons. Detection of the spontaneous emission of positrons would be the direct
evidence of this fundamental phenomenon. However, the spontaneous emission is generally masked
by the dynamical positron emission, which is induced by a strong time-dependent electric field
created by the colliding nuclei. In our recent paper [I.A. Maltsev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 113401
(2019)] it has been shown that the spontaneous pair production can be observed via measurements
of the pair-production probabilities for a given set of nuclear trajectories. In the present paper,
we have significantly advanced this study by exploring additional aspects of the process we are
interested in. We calculate the positron energy spectra and find that these spectra can give a clear
signature of the transition from the subcritical to the supercritical regime. It is found that focusing
on a part of the positron spectrum, which accounts for the energy region where the spontaneously
created positrons can contribute, allows to get a much stronger evidence of the transition to the
supercritical mode, making it very well pronounced in collisions, for example, of two uranium nuclei.
The possibility of extending this study to collisions of bare nuclei with neutral atoms is also considered.
The probability of a vacancy in the lowest-energy state of a quasimolecule which is formed in collisions
of a bare U nucleus with neutral U and Cm atoms has been calculated. The relatively large values of
this probability make such collisions suitable for observing the vacuum decay.
