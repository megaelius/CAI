This paper describes a computation of a part of the QED contribution to the electron anomalous magnetic
moment that was performed by the author with the help of a supercomputer. The computed part includes
all 5-loop QED Feynman graphs without lepton loops. The calculation has led to the result $A_1^{(2n)}[\text{no
lepton loops}]=6.793(90)$ that is slightly different than the value $7.668(159)$ presented by
T. Aoyama, T. Kinoshita, and M. Nio in 2018. The discrepancy is about $4.8\sigma$. The computation
gives the first independent check for that value. A shift in the fine-structure constant prediction
is revealed in the paper. The developed calculation method is based on (a) a subtraction procedure
for removing all ultraviolet and infrared divergences in Feynman parametric space before integration;
(b) a nonadaptive Monte Carlo integration that uses the probability density functions that are
constructed for each Feynman graph individually using its combinatorial structure. The method
is described briefly in the paper (with the corresponding references to the previous papers). The
values for the contributions of nine gauge-invariant classes splitting the whole set are presented
in the paper. Moreover, the whole set of all 5-loop graphs without lepton loops is split into 807 subsets
for comparison (in the future) of the calculated values with the values obtained by another methods.
These detailed results are presented in the supplemental materials. Also, the supplemental materials
contain the contribution values for each of 3213 individual Feynman graphs. An "oscillating" nature
of these values is discussed. Technical details of the realization are described.
