The weak-scale $U(1)_Y$-hypercharge Abelian Higgs Model (AHM) is the gauge theory of a complex
scalar $\phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(H+i\pi)$ and a vector $A^\mu$. When the $U(1)_Y$ is spontaneously
broken (SSB) the theory is in its Goldstone mode and $\phi\equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}{\tilde H}e^{i{\tilde
\pi}/<H>}$. The extended SSB E-AHM adds heavy ($M\gg m_{Weak}$) $U(1)_Y$ scalars $\Phi$ and fermions
$\psi$. In Lorenz gauge, the SSB E-AHM has a massless pseudo-scalar $\pi$, a conserved $U(1)_Y$
global current (but no conserved charge) and a Goldstone Theorem. $\tilde \pi$ becomes a Nambu-Goldstone
boson (NGB). Slavnov-Taylor IDs guarantee that on-shell T-matrix elements of physical states
$A^\mu$,$\phi$, $\Phi$, $\psi$ are invariant under anomaly-free $U(1)_Y$ local/gauge transformations,
though they break the global BRST symmetry. They are therefore also independent of anomaly-free
$U(1)_Y$ rigid/global transformations. Two towers of resulting "1-soft-pion" global WTI govern
the $\phi$-sector in Lorenz gauge. One gives relations among off-shell Green's functions, and
powerful constraints on the dynamics of the all-loop-orders $\phi$-sector effective E-AHM Lagrangian.
Another governs on-shell T-matrix elements with 1 additional soft pion. Adler self-consistency
relations for the E-AHM gauge theory guarantee infra-red finiteness for on-shell $\phi$-sector
T-matrix elements as $m_\pi^2\to 0$ in the SSB E-AHM. One of these on-shell WTI is the Goldstone theorem,
which results in an additional shift symmetry ${\tilde \pi}\to {\tilde \pi}+<H> \theta$. Therefore
SSB E-AHM physics has more symmetry than the effective Lagrangian. The NGB decouples from the observable
particle spectrum in the usual way, when the observable vector $B_\mu \equiv A_\mu + \frac{1}{e<H>}\partial_\mu{\tilde
\pi}$ absorbs it, hiding our WTI from observable particle physics.
