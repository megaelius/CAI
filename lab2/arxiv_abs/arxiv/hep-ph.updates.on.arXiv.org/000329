Primordial Black Holes (PBH) arise naturally from high peaks in the curvature power spectrum of
near-inflection-point single-field inflation, and could constitute today the dominant component
of the dark matter in the universe. In this letter we explore the possibility that a broad spectrum
of PBH is formed in models of Critical Higgs Inflation (CHI), where the near-inflection point is
related to the critical value of the RGE running of both the Higgs self-coupling $\lambda(\mu)$
and its non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi(\mu)$. We show that the half-domed-shaped peak in
the matter spectrum arises at sufficiently small scales that it passes all the constraints from
large scale structure observations. The predicted cosmic microwave background spectrum at large
scales is in agreement with Planck 2015 data. We find a relatively large tensor-to-scalar ratio,
that may be detected soon with B-mode polarization experiments. Moreover, the model predicts an
approximately lognormal PBH broad-mass distribution peaked at $\mu_{_{\rm PBH}}=12\, M_\odot$,
with dispersion $\sigma_{_{\rm PBH}}=0.8$, which is in the range of LIGO merger events, and passes
all present PBH constraints. The stochastic background of gravitational waves coming from the
unresolved black-hole-binary mergers could also be detected by LISA or PTA. Furthermore, the parameters
of the CHI model are consistent, within $2\sigma$, with the measured Higgs parameters at the LHC
and their running. Future measurements of the PBH mass spectrum will allow us to obtain complementary
information about the Higgs couplings at energies well above the EW scale, and thus constrain new
physics beyond the Standard Model.
