We revisit SN1987A constraints on light, hidden sector gauge bosons ("dark photons") that are coupled
to the standard model through kinetic mixing with the photon. These constraints are realized because
excessive bremsstrahlung radiation of the dark photon can lead to rapid cooling of the SN1987A progenitor
core, in contradiction to the observed neutrinos from that event. The models we consider are of interest
as phenomenological models of strongly self-interacting dark matter. We clarify several possible
ambiguities in the literature and identify errors in prior analyses. We find constraints on the
dark photon mixing parameter that are in rough agreement with the early estimates of Dent et al.,
but only because significant errors in their analyses fortuitously canceled. Our constraints
are in good agreement with subsequent analyses by Rrapaj & Reddy and Hardy & Lasenby. We estimate
the dark photon bremsstrahlung rate using one-pion exchange (OPE), while Rrapaj & Reddy use a soft
radiation approximation (SRA) to exploit measured nuclear scattering cross sections. We find
that the differences between mixing parameter constraints obtained through the OPE approximation
or the SRA approximation are roughly a factor of $\sim 2-3$. Hardy & Laseby include plasma effects
in their calculations finding significantly weaker constraints on dark photon mixing for dark
photon masses below $\sim 10\, \mathrm{MeV}$. We do not consider plasma effects. Lastly, we point
out that the properties of the SN1987A progenitor core remain somewhat uncertain and that this uncertainty
alone causes uncertainty of at least a factor of $\sim 2-3$ in the excluded values of the dark photon
mixing parameter. Further refinement of these estimates is unwarranted until either the interior
of the SN1987A progenitor is more well understood or additional, large, and heretofore neglected
effects, are identified.
