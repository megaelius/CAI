Exploring MSSM parameter space after the discovery of Higgs Boson with mass 125 GeV naturally demands
large top-squark mixing or large trilinear coupling parameter $A_t$ in particular, so as to avoid
excessively heavy squark, specially for the universal models like CMSSM. We study stability of
electroweak symmetry breaking vacua in possible presence of deeper charge-color symmetry breaking
minima within MSSM. Besides stable vacua, we consider scenarios characterized by the presence
of global CCB minima, with SM like charge and color conserving vacuum, having stability over cosmologically
large lifetime {(\it long-lived states)}. We allow vacuum expectation values for both stop as well
as sbottom fields, since these belong to the third generation of sfermions with larger Yukawa couplings
that have immediate effect on the tunneling time. Moreover, for large $\mu$ regions, radiative
corrections to Higgs boson mass from bottom-squark loop is quite significant. Regions of MSSM parameters
space become viable for large $A_t$ and large $\mu$ zones which are generically excluded via the
traditional analytical CCB constraints. For a large value of $\tan\beta$, safe vacua associated
with large values of $|\mu|$ and $|A_t|$ are predominantly long-lived and may be associated with
relatively light stop masses. We also identify low $\mu$ regions associated with long-lived states.
Both the above zones can be friendly to muon $g-2$ constraint. We also impose constraints from ${\rm
Br}(B \rightarrow X_s \gamma)$ and ${\rm Br}(B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$. We do the analysis
for a moderate and a large $\tan\beta$. Results are compatible with dark matter related constraints,
as expected.
