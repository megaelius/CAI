Changing the dimensionality of the space-time at the smallest and largest distances has manifold
theoretical advantages. If the space is lower dimensional in the high energy regime, then there
are no ultraviolet divergencies in field theories, it is possible to quantize gravity, and the theory
of matter plus gravity is free of divergencies or renormalizable. If the space is higher dimensional
at cosmological scales, then some cosmological problems (including the cosmological constant
problem) can be attacked from a completely new perspective. In this paper, we construct an explicit
model of "evolving dimensions" in which the dimensions open up as the temperature of the universe
drops. We adopt the string theory framework in which the dimensions are fields that live on the string
worldsheet, and add temperature dependent mass terms for them. At the Big Bang, all the dimensions
are very heavy and are not excited. As the universe cools down, dimensions open up one by one. Thus,
the dimensionality of the space we live in depends on the energy or temperature that we are probing.
In particular, we provide a kinematic Brandenberger-Vafa argument for how a discrete {\it causal
set}, and eventually a continuum $(3+1)$-dim spacetime along with Einstein gravity emerge in the
Infrared from the worldsheet action. The $(3+1)$-dim Planck mass and the string scale become directly
related, {\it without any} compactification. Amongst other predictions, we argue that LHC might
be blind to new physics even if it comes at the TeV scale. In contrast, cosmic ray experiments, especially
those that can register the very beginning of the shower, and collisions with high multiplicity
and density of particles, might be sensitive to the dimensional cross-over.
