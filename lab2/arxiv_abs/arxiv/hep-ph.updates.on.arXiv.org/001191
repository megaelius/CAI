The standard model of elementary particles (SM) suffers from various problems, such as power-law
ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity, exclusion of general relativity (GR), and absence of a dark matter
candidate. The LHC experiments, according to which the TeV domain appears to be empty of new particles,
started sidelining TeV-scale SUSY and other known cures of the UV sensitivity. In search for a remedy,
in this work, it is revealed that affine curvature can emerge in a way restoring gauge symmetries
explicitly broken by the UV cutoff. This emergent curvature cures the UV sensitivity and incorporates
GR as symmetry-restoring emergent gravity ({\it symmergent gravity}, in brief) if a new physics
sector (NP) exists to generate the Planck scale and if SM+NP is fermi-bose balanced. This setup,
carrying fingerprints of trans-Planckian SUSY, predicts that gravity is Einstein (no higher-curvature
terms), cosmic/gamma rays can originate from heavy NP scalars, and the UV cutoff might take right
value to suppress the cosmological constant (alleviating fine-tuning with SUSY). The NP does not
have to couple to the SM. In fact, NP-SM coupling can take any value from zero to $\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$
if the SM is not to jump from $\Lambda_{SM}\approx 500\, {\rm GeV}$ to the NP scale $\Lambda_{NP}$.
The zero coupling, certifying an undetectable NP, agrees with all the collider and dark matter bounds
at present. The {\it seesawic} bound $\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$, directly verifiable
at colliders, implies that: {\it (i)} dark matter must have a mass $\lesssim \Lambda_{SM}$, {\it
(ii)} Higgs-curvature coupling must be $\approx 1.3\%$, {\it (iii)} the SM RGEs must remain nearly
as in the SM, and {\it (iv)} right-handed neutrinos must have a mass $\lesssim 1000\, {\rm TeV}$.
These signatures serve as a concise testbed for symmergence.
