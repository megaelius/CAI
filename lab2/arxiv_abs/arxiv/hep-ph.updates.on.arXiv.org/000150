We describe a methodology for testing No-Scale Supergravity by the LAT instrument onboard the Fermi
Space Telescope via observation of gamma ray emissions from lightest supersymmetric (SUSY) neutralino
annihilations. For our test vehicle we engage the framework of the supersymmetric grand unified
model No-Scale Flipped $SU(5)$ with extra vector-like flippon multiplets derived from F-Theory,
known as $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$. We show that through compression of the light stau and light bino neutralino
mass difference, where internal bremsstrahlung (IB) photons give a dominant contribution, the
photon yield from annihilation of SUSY dark matter can be elevated to a number of events potentially
observable by the Fermi-LAT in the coming years. Likewise, the increased yield in No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$
may also have rendered the existing observation of a 133 GeV monochromatic gamma ray line visible,
if additional data should exclude systematic or statistical explanations. The question of intensity
aside, No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$ can indeed provide a natural weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP) candidate with a mass in the correct range to yield $\gamma \gamma$ and $\gamma Z$ emission
lines at $m_{\chi} \sim 133$ GeV and $m_{\chi} \sim 145$ GeV, respectively. Additionally, we elucidate
the emerging empirical connection between recent Planck satellite data and No-Scale Supergravity
cosmological models which mimic the Starobinsky model of inflation. Together, these experiments
furnish rich alternate avenues for testing No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$, and similarly structured
models, the results of which may lend independent credence to observations made at the LHC.
