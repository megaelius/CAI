We propose several different pseudo-entropy measures for CMB analysis that agree well with the
Wehrl entropy but are significantly faster to compute. All of the presented alternatives are rotationally
invariant measures that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity or anisotropy in the data. We provide
a simple proof that the projection pseudo-entropy converges to the Wehrl entropy with increasing
dimensionality of the ancilla projection space. Furthermore, for $l = 2$, we show that both the Wehrl
entropy and the angular pseudo entropy can be expressed as one-dimensional functions of the squared
chordal distance of multipole vectors, giving a tight connection between the two measures. We also
show that the angular pseudo entropy can clearly distinguish between Gaussian and non-Gaussian
temperature fluctuations at large multipoles and henceforth provides a non-brute force method
for identifying non-Gaussianities. This allows us to study possible hints of statistical anisotropy
and non-Gaussianity in the CMB up to multipole $l = 1000$ using Planck 2015, Planck 2018 and WMAP 7-year
data. We find that $l = 5$ and $l = 28$ have a large entropy at $2-3\sigma$ significance and a slight
hint towards a connection of this with the Cosmic Dipole. On a wider range of large angular scales
we do not find indications of violation of isotropy or Gaussianity. We also find a small scale range,
$l \in [895;905]$, that is incompatible with the assumptions at $3\sigma$-level, although how
much this significance can be reduced by taking into account the selection effect is left as an open
question. Furthermore, we find overall similar results in our analysis of the 2015 and the 2018 data.
Finally, we also demonstrate how a range of angular momenta can be studied with the range angular
pseudo entropy, which measures averages and correlations of different multipoles.
