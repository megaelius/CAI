We review our results in Refs.[1,2] for the masses and couplings of heavy-light DD(BB)-like molecules
and (Qq)(Qq)-like four-quark states from relativistic QCD Laplace sum rules (LSR) where next-to-next-to-leading
order (N2LO) PT corrections in the chiral limit, next-to-leading order (NLO) SU3 PT corrections
and non-perturbative contributions up to dimension d=6-8 are included. The factorization properties
of molecule and four-quark currents have been used for the estimate of the higher order PT corrections.
New integrated compact expressions of the spectral functions at leading order (LO) of perturbative
QCD and up to dimensions d< (6 - 8) non-perturbative condensates are presented. The results are summarized
in Tables 5 to 10, from which we conclude, within the errors, that the observed XZ states are good candidates
for being 1^{++} and 0^{++} molecules or/and four-quark states, contrary to the observed Y states
which are too light compared to the predicted 1^{-\pm} and 0^{-\pm} states. We find that the SU3 breakings
are relatively small for the masses (< 10(resp. 3)%) for the charm (resp. bottom) channels while
they are large (< 20%) for the couplings which decrease faster (1/m_{b}^{3/2}) than 1/m_{b}^{1/2}
of HQET. QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) approach cannot clearly separate (within the errors) molecules
from four-quark states having the same quantum numbers. Results for the BK (DK)-like molecules
and (Qq)(us)-like four-quark states from [3] are also reviewed which do not favour the molecule
or/and four-quark interpretation of the X(5568). We suggest to scan the charm (2327 ~ 2444) MeV and
bottom (5173 ~ 5226) MeV regions for detecting the (unmixed)(cu)ds and (bu)ds states. We expect
that future experimental data and lattice results will check our predictions.
