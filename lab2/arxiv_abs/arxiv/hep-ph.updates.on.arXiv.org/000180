We investigate the CP-averaged branching ratios, polarization fractions, relative phases, and
CP-violating asymmetries of penguin-dominated $B \to \phi K_1(1270) $ and $ \phi K_1(1400)$ decays
in the perturbative QCD(pQCD) approach, where $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$ are believed to be the
mixtures of two distinct types of axial-vector $K_{1A}(^3P_1)$ and $K_{1B}(^1P_1)$ states with
different behavior, however, their mixing angle $\theta_{K_1}$ is still a hot and controversial
topic presently. By numerical evaluations and phenomenological analysis, we find that: (a) the
pQCD results for branching ratio, longitudinal polarization fraction and direct CP violation
of $B^\pm \to \phi K_1(1270)^\pm$ decay with $\theta_{K_1} \sim 33^\circ$ are in good agreement
with the currently available data; (b) with the same mixing angle, the pQCD prediction of $Br(B^\pm
\to \phi K_1(1400)^\pm)$ exceeds significantly the available upper limits but is consistent with
that obtained in QCD factorization within errors. This result and other relevant predictions for
the considered modes will be further tested by the Large Hadron Collider beauty and forthcoming
Super-B experiments; (c) the weak annihilation contributions play an important role in $B \to \phi
K_1(1270)$ and $\phi K_1(1400)$ decays, apart from the very small enhancement to the branching
ratios of the former two modes, which will be helpful to shed light on the annihilation decay mechanism
in vector-vector and vector-axial-vector $B$ decays; (d) these pQCD predictions combined with
the future precision measurements can not only examine the reliability of the approach employed
here to study the decays involving a $p$-wave axial-vector meson, but also explore the complicated
QCD dynamics and mixing angle $\theta_{K_1}$ of the axial-vector $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$
system.
