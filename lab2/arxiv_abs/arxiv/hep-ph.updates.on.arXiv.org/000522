Without any shred of evidence for new physics from LHC, the last hiding spots of natural electroweak
supersymmetry seem to lie either in compressed spectra or in spectra where scalars are suppressed
with respect to the gauginos. While in the MSSM (or in any theory where supersymmetry is broken by
the $F$-vev of a chiral spurion), a hierarchy between scalar and gaugino masses requires special
constructions, it is automatic in scenarios where supersymmetry is broken by $D$-vev of a real spurion.
In the latter framework, gaugino mediated contributions to scalar soft masses are finite (loop
suppressed but not $\log$-enhanced), a feature often referred to as "supersoftness". Though phenomenologically
attractive, pure supersoft models suffer from the $\mu$-problem, potential color-breaking minima,
large $T$-parameter, etc. These problems can be overcome without sacrificing the model's virtues
by departing from pure supersoftness and including $\mu$-type operators that use the same $D$-vev,
a framework known as generalized supersoft supersymmetry. The main purpose of this paper is to point
out that the new operators also solve the last remaining issue associated with supersoft spectra,
namely that a right handed (RH) slepton is predicted to be the lightest superpartner, rendering
the setup cosmologically unfeasible. In particular, we show that the $\mu$-operators in generalized
supersoft generate a new source for scalar masses, which can raise the RH-slepton mass above bino
due to corrections from renormalisation group evolutions (RGEs). In fact, a mild tuning can open
up the bino--RH slepton coannihilation regime for a thermal dark matter. We derive the full set of
RGEs required to determine the spectrum at low energies. Beginning with input conditions at a high
scale, we show that completely viable spectra can be achieved.
