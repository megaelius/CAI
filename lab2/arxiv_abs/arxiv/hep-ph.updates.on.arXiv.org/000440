We discuss inflation models within supersymmetry and supergravity frameworks which possess an
axionic landscape and a shift symmetry which is broken by non-perturbative symmetry breaking terms
in the superpotential. The proposed models constitute consistent inflation for the following
reasons: The inflation potential arises dynamically with stabilized saxions, the axion decay
constant can lie in the sub-Planckian region, and consistency with the Planck data is achieved.
The axion landscape consisting of $m$ axion pairs is assumed with the axions in each pair having opposite
charges. A fast roll--slow roll splitting mechanism for the axion potential is proposed which is
realized with a special choice of the axion basis. In this basis the $2m$ coupled equations split
into $2m-1$ equations which enter in the fast roll and there is one unique linear combination of the
$2m$ fields which controls the slow roll and thus the power spectrum of curvature and tensor perturbations.
It is shown that a significant part of the parameter space exists where inflation is successful,
i.e., $N_{\rm pivot} = {[50, 60]}$, the spectral index $n_s$ of curvature perturbations, and the
ratio $r$ of the power spectrum of tensor perturbations and curvature perturbations, lie in the
experimentally allowed regions given by the Planck experiment. Further, it is shown that the model
allows for a significant region of the parameter space where the effective axion decay constant
can lie in the sub-Planckian domain. An analysis of the tensor spectral index $n_t$ is also given
and the future experimental data which constraints $n_t$ will further narrow down the parameter
space of the proposed inflationary models.
