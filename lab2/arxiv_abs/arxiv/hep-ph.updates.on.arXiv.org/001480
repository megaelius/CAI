In the paper, the physical observables for $D \to V(\omega,\rho, K^*)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ semileptonic
decays are investigated thoroughly with the SSE extrapolated HFFs, which are calculated within
the framework of QCD LCSR and up to twist-4. For the decay width parts, we find that $1/|V_{cq}|^2\times
\Gamma^{\rm L,T,total} (D \to V\ell^+\nu_\ell)$ decrease with the increase of final meson mass,
and the absolute change number of the transverse and longitudinal are almost the same. The transverse
differential decay width dominates in the small $q^2$ region, while the longitudinal differential
decay width dominates in the large $q^2$ region, and the dominant alternate point is near the midpoint
of the whole physically feasible region. We then calculate the branching fractions by applying
the $D^0(D^+)$ meson lifetime from the Particle Data Group. All those branching fraction results
are lower compared to other theories, but fits well with BES-III predictions within errors. For
the polarization parts, we study in detail the $q^2$ dependence of longitudinal and transverse
polarizations fractions of the charged lepton and the vector meson in the final state, i.e. $P_{\rm
L,T}^\ell$ and $F_{\rm L,T}^\ell$, the forward-backward asymmetry ${\cal A}_{\rm FB}^\ell$
and the lepton-side convexity parameters ${\cal C}_{\rm F}^\ell$. In the small $q^2$ region, all
those polarization observations have a singularity due to the $\delta_\ell$ factor, expect for
$F_{\rm {L, T}}^\ell$. With the increase of $q^2$, all polarization values tend to be more stable,
thus the polarization dependence on $q^2$ is smaller. Our predictions for their corresponding
average values have agreement with the theoretical group for Covariant Confining Quark Model results
within the errors.
