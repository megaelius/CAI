The signal strength of the $gg \to H \to \gamma \gamma$ reaction in $pp$ collisions at the LHC is studied
within the context of the SM with UED. The impact of an arbitrary number $n$ of UED on both the $gg\to
H$ and $H\to \gamma \gamma$ subprocesses is studied. The 1-loop contributions of Kaluza-Klein
excitations to these subprocesses are proportional to discrete and continuous sums, which can
diverge. By implementing dimensional regularization, it is shown that discrete regularized sums
can naturally be expressed as multidimensional Epstein functions, and that divergences, if exist,
emerge through the poles of these functions. It is found that continuous sums converge, but the discrete
ones diverge, with the exception of the $n=1$ case, in which the 1-dimensional Epstein function
converges. It is argued that divergences that arise from discrete sums for $n\geq 2$ are genuine
UV divergences, since they correspond to short-distance effects in the compact manifold. Then,
the amplitudes are renormalized in a modern sense by incorporating interactions of canonical dimension
higher than four that allow us to generate the required counterterms, which are determined using
a $\overline{\rm MS}$-like renormalization scheme. We find that the $gg\to H$ subprocess is quite
sensitive to both the size and the dimension of the compact manifold, but the SM prediction for $H\to
\gamma \gamma$ subprocess is practically unchanged. In the $n=1$ case, it is found that the experimental
constraint on the compactification scale $R^{-1}\geq 1.5$ TeV allow us to reproduce the experimental
limit on the signal strength $1.01\leq \mu^{(1)}_{\gamma \gamma}\leq 1.2$. In the $n\geq 2$ cases,
it is found that the experimental limit on $\mu^{(n)}_{\gamma \gamma}$ leads to stronger lower
bounds for the compactification scale given by $R^{-1}\geq 1.55, 2.45, 3.57, 5.10, 7.25$ TeVs for
$n=2, 4, 6, 8, 10$, respectively.
