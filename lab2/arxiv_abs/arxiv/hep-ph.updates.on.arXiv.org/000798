We study the collider phenomenology of non minimal universal extra dimensional (nmUED) model in
the context of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. nmUED is an incarnation of the Standard Model in
$(4+1)$ space-time dimensions compactified on an $\bf{S_1}/\bf{Z_2}$ orbifold supplemented
with boundary localized operators with unknown coefficients. These coefficients parametrize
the radiative corrections which are somehow arbitrary due to the lack of knowledge of the cut-off
scale of such effective theory. It is possible to tune the masses and couplings of the Kaluza Klein
(KK) excitations by tuning these parameters. Two scenarios with different mass hierarchies among
the KK-excitations have been considered. A detailed study of production cross-sections and different
decay modes of KK-particles are also presented. We calculate the correlated bounds on masses of
KK-particles using the LHC $nl + mj + E\!\!\!\!/_T$ data (in case of production of strongly interacting
particles) and $3l + E\!\!\!\!/_T$ data (in case of electroweak productions). We work in a KK-parity
conserving scenario where the lightest KK-particle is a potential dark (DM) matter candidate.
We use the additional constraints coming from the observed DM relic density of the universe to identify
the allowed parameter space. The current status of a nmUED model in the light of DM direct detection
data is also examined. The present investigation reveals that production and subsequent leptonic
decays of KK-electroweak gauge bosons as massive as 1 TeV, lead to observable trilepton signature
with a luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$ which will be realized in near future.
