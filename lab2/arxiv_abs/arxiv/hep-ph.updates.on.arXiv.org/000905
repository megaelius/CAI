New massive spin-2 particles are predicted in theoretical extensions to the Standard Model (SM)
attempting to solve the hierarchy problem. Such theories postulate that gravity is diluted compared
to the other fundamental forces because it can propagate in extra spatial dimensions. While such
theoretical models are of high experimental interest because they predict massive spin-2 particles
($Y_{2}$) potentially detectable by collider experiments, searches at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) have thus far produced no significant evidence for their existence. This work considers a
hypothetical physics scenario where low coupling strengths between the $Y_{2}$ and quarks/gluons
is the underlying reason behind the null $Y_{2}$ search results at the LHC, which have mainly relied
on Drell-Yan and gluon-gluon fusion production mechanisms. The focus of this paper is a feasibility
study to search for $Y_{2}$ particles using vector boson fusion (VBF) processes at the LHC. In the
context of an effective field theory approach with varying couplings $\kappa_{V}$ between $Y_{2}$
and the weak bosons of the SM, we consider the $Y_{2}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode to show that the
requirement of a diphoton pair combined with two high $p_{T}$ forward jets with large dijet mass
and with large separation in pseudorapidity can significantly reduce the SM backgrounds. Assuming
proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, we present the total VBF production cross sections,
$Y_{2}$ decay widths, and $Y_{2}\to\gamma\gamma$ branching ratios as a function of $m(Y_{2})$,
considering universal and non-universal couplings to the SM particles. The unitarity-violating
phase space is described. The proposed VBF $Y_{2}\to\gamma\gamma$ search is expected to achieve
a discovery reach with signal significance greater than 5$\sigma$ for $Y_{2}$ masses up to 4.4 TeV
and $\kappa_{V}$ couplings down to 0.5.
