We consider a class of unified models based on the gauge group $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ which with appropriate
choice of Higgs representations generate in a natural way a pair of light Higgs doublets needed to
accomplish electroweak symmetry breaking. In this class of models higher dimensional operators
of the form matter-matter-Higgs-Higgs in the superpotential after spontaneous breaking of the
GUT symmetry generate contributions to Yukawa couplings which are comparable to the ones from cubic
interactions. Specifically we consider an $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ model with a sector consisting of
$\mathsf{126+\overline{126} + 210}$ of heavy Higgs which breaks the GUT symmetry down to the standard
model gauge group and a sector consisting of $2\times \mathsf{10+120}$ of light Higgs fields. In
this model we compute the corrections from the quartic interactions to the Yukawa couplings for
the top and the bottom quarks and for the tau lepton. It is then shown that inclusion of these corrections
to the GUT scale Yukawas allows for consistency of the top, bottom and tau masses with experiment
for low $\tan\beta$ with a value as low as $\tan\beta$ of 5$-$10. We compute the sparticle spectrum
for a set of benchmarks and find that satisfaction of the relic density is achieved via a compressed
spectrum and coannihilation and three sets of coannihilations appear: chargino-neutralino,
stop-neutralino and stau-neutralino. We investigate the chargino-neutralino coannihilation
in detail for the possibility of observation of the light chargino at the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)
and at the high energy LHC (HE-LHC) which is a possible future 27 TeV hadron collider. It is shown that
all benchmark models but one can be discovered at HL-LHC and all would be discoverable at HE-LHC.
The ones discoverable at both machines require a much shorter time scale and a lower integrated luminosity
at HE-LHC.
