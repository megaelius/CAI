The dilaton-limit fixed point and the scaling properties of hadrons in the close vicinity of the
fixed point in dense baryonic matter uncovered in hidden local symmetry implemented with spontaneously
broken scale symmetry are shown to reveal a surprisingly intricate interplay, hitherto unsuspected,
between the origin of the bulk of proton mass and the renormalization-group flow of the $\omega$-nuclear
interactions. This rends a theoretical support to the previous (phenomenologically) observed
correlation between the dropping nucleon mass and the behavior of the $\omega$-nuclear interactions
in dense matter described in terms of half skyrmions that appear at a density denoted $n_{1/2}$ in
skyrmion crystals. The role of the $\omega$-meson degree of freedom in the source for nucleon mass
observed in this paper is highly reminiscent of its important role in the skyrmion description of
nucleon mass in hidden local symmetric theory. One of the most notable novel results found in this
paper is that the nucleon mass in dense baryonic medium undergoes a drop roughly linear in density
up to a density (denoted $\tilde{n}$) slightly above nuclear matter density ($n_0$) and then stays
more or less constant up to the dilaton limit fixed point. The possibility that we entertain is that
$\tilde{n}$ coincides with or at least close to $n_{1/2}$. We note that this feature can be economically
captured by the parity-doublet model for nucleons with the chiral-invariant mass $m_0\sim (0.7-0.8)
m_N$. It is found in one-loop renormalization-group analysis with the Lagrangian adopted that
while the $\rho$-NN coupling "runs" in density, the $\omega$-NN coupling does not scale: it will
scale at two-loop or higher-loop order, but at a slower pace, so it is more appropriate to say it "walks"
rather than runs.
