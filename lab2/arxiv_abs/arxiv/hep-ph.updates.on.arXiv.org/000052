The interference effects between an extra neutral spin-1 Z'-boson and the Standard Model background
in the Drell-Yan channel at the LHC are studied in detail. The final state with two oppositely charged
leptons is considered. The interference contribution to the new physics signal, currently neglected
by experimental collaborations in Z'-searches and in the interpretation of the results, can be
substantial. It may affect limits or discovery prospects of Z' at the LHC. As the Z'-boson interference
is model-dependent, a proper treatment would a priori require a dedicated experimental analysis
for each particular model. Doing so could potentially improve the sensitivity to new physics, but
would require a much bigger effort from the experimental side. At the same time, it is shown that one
can define an invariant mass window, valid for a wide range of models, for which the contribution
of the model-dependent interference to the Beyond the Standard Model signal is reduced down to O(10%)
level, comparable to the level of the combined uncertainty from parton densities and higher order
corrections. This quasi-model independent "magic cut" does not scale with the mass of the Z'-boson
and is approximately constant over a large range of masses. Such a control of the interference effects
relies on not-too-small branching ratios of Z' to leptons which can be suppressed, however, by an
additional new decay channels of the Z' increasing the interference effect. Under the general assumption
that these new decay chanels of Z' are not dominant, one can perform quasi-model independent analyses,
preserving the current scheme used by the experimental collaborations for the Z'-boson search
using the suggested invariant mass window cut.
