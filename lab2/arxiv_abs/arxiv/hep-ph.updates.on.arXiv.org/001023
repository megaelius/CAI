We review on a chiral power counting for in-medium chiral perturbation theory with nucleons and
pions as explicit degrees of freedom coupled to external sources. It allows for a systematic expansion
including both local and pion-mediated inter-nucleon interactions. One can identify from this
power counting classes of non-perturbative diagrams that require resummation. A non-perturbative
method based on Unitary Chiral Perturbation Theory was also developed for performing those resummations.
This power counting and non-perturbative techniques were firstly applied to calculate the pion
self-energy, the pion-decay constants and the quark condensate in nuclear matter up-to-and-including
next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions. The cancellation of the contributions at NLO to the
pion self-energy and decay constants from in-medium nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions was derived.
Some NLO NN contributions survive for the quark condensate due to the quark-mass dependence of the
pion mass. Next, we discuss the calculation of the energy density in the nuclear medium by employing
the in-medium NN scattering amplitudes. For symmetric and neutron matter it reproduces in good
agreement, and without fine tuning, calculations from realistic NN potentials with a model for
the three-nucleon interaction. These results are applied to derive the equation of state (EOS)
for neutron stars and obtain an upper limit for a neutron mass slightly above 2 solar masses. Our results
also fulfill other constraints from the detection of the gravitational waves in the event GW170817,
like the upper bound on the maximal mass of a neutron star and the allowed interval for the radius of
a 1.4-solar-mass neutron star. The knowledge of the neutron-matter EOS is also employed to give
an upper bound of the gravitational constant within the strong gravitational field of a 2 solar-mass
neutron star.
