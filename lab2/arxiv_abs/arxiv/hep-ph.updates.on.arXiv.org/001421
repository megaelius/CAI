Recently the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, with very-long baseline interferometric
observations, resolved structure at the scale of $\sim5$ Schwarzschild radii about the center
of M87$^*$, the supermassive black hole resident at the center of Messier 87. This important observation
has paved the way for testing what is known as the "no-hair" theorem, stating that isolated black
holes are described by the Kerr metric, parameterized only by their mass and spin. Generic, parameterized
spacetimes beyond Kerr allow one to arbitrarily test the no-hair theorem for deviations from the
Kerr result with no prior theoretical knowledge or motivation. In this paper, we present such a new
general, stationary, axisymmetric and asymptotically flat black hole solution with separable
geodesic equations (thus preserving symmetries of a Kerr black hole), extending the previous work
of Johannsen. In this new metric, five free non-linear functions parameterically deviate from
the Kerr result, allowing one to effectively transform to many alternative black hole solutions
present in the literature. We then derive analytic expressions for the Keplerian and epicyclic
frequencies, the orbital energy and angular momentum, and the location of the innermost stable
orbit of circular equatorial particle orbits. We also compute the image of the photon rings in the
new spacetime, which correspond to the boundary of the black hole shadow image taken by the Event
Horizon Telescope. We finally compare each quantity for the Kerr result against various parameterizations
of the metric, finding that, especially for highly rotating black holes, the two solutions disagree
significantly. Such a metric parameterization allows one to perform the no-hair tests in a model-independent
way, and finally map constraints to specific alternative theories of gravity.
