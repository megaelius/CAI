Within the chiral unitary approach and with the constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry, we study
the coupled channel interactions of ${\bar D}^{(*)}\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ channels, close to whose
thresholds three pentaquark-like $P_c$ states have been reported by the LHCb Collaboration. In
the present work, we take into account the contributions of pion exchanges via box diagrams to the
interaction potentials, and therefore lift the degeneracy in the masses of ${\bar D}^*\Sigma_c^{(*)}$
spin multiplets. Fitting the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distributions in the $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi
K^- p$ decay, we find that the LHCb pentaquark states can not be reproduced in the direct $J/\psi p$
production in the $\Lambda_b^0$ decay, and can only be indirectly produced in the final state interactions
of the $\Lambda_b^0$ decay products, ${\bar D}^*\Sigma_c^{(*)}$, which further supports the
nature of these states as $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$ molecules. Based on the fit results obtained, we study
the partial decay widths/branching ratios to other decay channels, $\bar{D}^* \Lambda_c$, $\bar{D}
\Lambda_c$, and $\eta_c N$, and the corresponding invariant mass distributions. The resonances
with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$, $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and the one of $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c^*$ around
4500 MeV, have large partial decay width into $\eta_c N$, and thus, can be easily seen in the $\eta_c
N$ invariant mass distributions. By contrast, the states with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$, $P_c(4457)$,
the (predicted) narrow $P_c(4380)$ and the bound state of $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c^*$ with a mass of
about 4520 MeV, do not decay into $\eta_c N$. Therefore, the $\eta_c N$ channel should be studied
in future to provide further insights into the nature of these states, especially that of the $P_c(4440)$
and $P_c(4457)$.
