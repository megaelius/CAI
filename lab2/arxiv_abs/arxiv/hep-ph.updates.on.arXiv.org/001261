We propose a model of quark flavor based on an additional $SU(2)\times U(1)$ local symmetry in a warped
extra dimensional bulk. In contrast to other works, we break the additional gauge symmetry in the
bulk via two complex scalars which acquire bulk vevs, rather than relying on brane-localized symmetry
breaking. A gauge-covariant Kaluza-Klein decomposition of a theory with a bulk spontaneously
broken gauge symmetry is performed, and exact expressions for the bulk profiles of all physical
particles in such systems are given. The SM quark masses and mixings are then recreated using gauge-covariant
bulk quark mass terms and Yukawa-like couplings to the new bulk scalars. A numerical sampling of
points in the model parameter space that recreate the quark masses and mixings is performed at a KK
scale of $M_{KK} =5$ TeV. We then compute the $\Delta F = 2$ 4-quark operators arising from our new
flavor gauge bosons and scalars, and those arising from Kaluza-Klein modes of SM gauge bosons. By
decoupling one of our bulk scalar fields to all quark fields except the right-handed up-like sector,
we find that it is possible to greatly suppress tree-level contributions to the highly constrained
Kaon mixing parameters. Instead, the dominant constraints on the model emerge from neutral $B_d$
and $D$ meson mixing. These constraints are explored with our numerical sampling of the model parameter
space, and the specific contribution of the new flavor gauge bosons and scalars is discussed. We
find that for a significant range of realistic flavor gauge couplings, the new gauge bosons compete
with the normally dominant gluon flavor-changing currents, but flavor-changing operators emerging
from the bulk scalar fields are highly suppressed. Finally, we briefly comment on flavor constraints
that are independent of the flavor gauge sector arising from the $Z \bar{b}_L b_L$ coupling and rare
top decays.
