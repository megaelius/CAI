We study the isospin breaking in the reactions $\chi_{c1} \to \pi^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\chi_{c1}
\to \pi^0 \pi^0 \eta$ and its relation to the $a_0(980) - f_0(980)$ mixing, which was measured by
the BESIII Collaboration. We show that the same theoretical model previously developed to study
the $\chi_{c1} \to \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ reaction (also measured by BESIII), and further explored in
the predictions to the $\eta_{c} \to \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$, can be successfully employed in the present
study. We assume that the $\chi_{c1}$ behaves as an $SU(3)$ singlet to find the weight in which trios
of pseudoscalars are created, followed by the final state interaction of pairs of mesons to describe
how the $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ are dynamically generated, using the chiral unitary approach
in coupled channels. The isospin violation is introduced through the use of different masses for
the charged and neutral kaons, either in the propagators of the pairs of mesons created in the $\chi_{c1}$
decay, or in the propagators inside the $T$ matrix, constructed through the unitarization of the
scattering and transition amplitudes of pairs of pseudoscalar mesons. We find that violating isospin
inside the $T$ matrix makes the $\pi^0\eta \to \pi^+\pi^-$ amplitude nonzero, which gives an important
contribution and also enhances the effect of the $K\bar{K}$ term. Also, we find that in the total
amplitude the most important effect is the isospin breaking inside the $T$ matrix, due to the constructive
sum of $\pi^0\eta \to \pi^+\pi^-$ and $K\bar{K} \to \pi^+ \pi^-$, which is essential to get a good
agreement with the experimental measurement of the mixing.
