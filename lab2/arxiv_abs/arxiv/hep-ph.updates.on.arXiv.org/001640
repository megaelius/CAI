The radiative correction to beta function is comprehensively studied at 1 loop in the context of
universal extra dimensions. Instead of using cutoffs to regularize 1-loop divergences, the dimensional
regularization scheme is used. Large momenta effects are removed from physical amplitudes by adjusting
the parameters of the appropriate counterterms. The use of a SU(N)-covariant gauge-fixing procedure
is stressed. 1-loop contributions of KK excitations are characterized by discrete KK sums and continuous
momenta sums, which can diverge. Two types of UVs are identified, one arising from poles of the gamma
function and associated with short-distance effects in the usual 4-dimensional spacetime manifold,
and the other emerging either from poles of the 1-dimensional Epstein function or from the gamma
function, and corresponding to short-distance effects in the compact manifold. We address the
cases of 5 and 4+n dimensions (n>1) separately. In 5 dimensions the 1-dimensional Epstein function
is convergent, so the usual counterterm renormalizes the vacuum polarization function. For 4+n
dimensions, the 1-dimensional Epstein function is divergent, so renormalization is implemented
by interactions of canonical dimension higher than 4, already present in the effective theory.
The polarization function is renormalized using both mass-dependent and mass-independent schemes,
with extra-dimensions effects decoupling in the former case but not in the latter. The beta function
is calculated for an arbitrary number of extra dimensions. Our main result is that Yang-Mills theory
remains perturbative at 1 loop, which is in disagreement with the results obtained in the literature
by using a cutoff regulator, which suggest that Yang-Mills theory in more than 4 dimensions ceases
to be perturbative. We emphasize the advantages of a mass-dependent scheme in this type of theories,
in which decoupling is manifest.
