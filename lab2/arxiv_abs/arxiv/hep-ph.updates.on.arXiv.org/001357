Background: The near-equilibrium properties of a QCD plasma can be encoded into transport coefficients
such as bulk and shear viscosity. In QCD, the ratio of these transport coefficients to entropy density,
$\zeta/s$ and $\eta/s$, depends non-trivially on the plasma's temperature. Purpose: We show that
in a 0+1D boost-invariant fluid, a temperature-dependent $\zeta/s(T)$ or $\eta/s(T)$ can be described
by an equivalent effective viscosity $\left\langle \zeta/s \right\rangle_{\textrm{eff}}$
or $\left\langle \eta/s \right\rangle_{\textrm{eff}}$. We extend the concept of effective viscosity
in systems with transverse expansion, and discuss how effective viscosities can be used to identify
families of $\zeta/s(T)$ and $\eta/s(T)$ that lead to similar hydrodynamic evolution. Results:
In 0+1D, the effective viscosity is expressed as a simple integral of $\zeta/s(T)$ or $\eta/s(T)$
over temperature, with a weight determined by the speed of sound of the fluid. The result is general
for any equation of state with a moderate temperature dependence of the speed of sound, including
the QCD equation of state. In 1+1D, a similar definition of effective viscosity is obtained in terms
of characteristic trajectories in time and transverse direction. This leads to an infinite number
of constraints on an infinite functional space for $\zeta/s(T)$ and $\eta/s(T)$. Conclusions:
The definition of effective viscosity in a 0+1D system clarifies how infinite families of $\zeta/s(T)$
and $\eta/s(T)$ can result in nearly identical hydrodynamic temperature profiles. By extending
the study to a boost-invariant cylindrical (1+1D) fluid, we identify an approximate but more general
definition of effective viscosity that highlight the potential and limits of the concept of effective
viscosity in fluids with limited symmetries.
