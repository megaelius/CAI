We propose to generate non-universal gaugino masses in SU(5) GUT with the generalized Planck-scale
mediation of SUSY breaking, in which the non-universality arises from introducing certain high-representation
Higgs fields either directly with their F-term VEVs or by wavefunction normalization with their
lowest component VEVs. The gluino-SUGRA-like scenario, where gluinos are much heavier than winos,
binos and universal scalar masses, can be easily realized with appropriate combinations of such
high-representation Higgs fields. With six GUT-scale free parameters in our scenario, we can solve
graciously the tension between mSUGRA and the present experimental results, including the muon
g-2, the dark matter (DM) relic density and the direct sparticle search bounds from the LHC. Taking
into account the current constraints in our numerical scan, we have the following observations:
(i) A large $|M_3|$ ($\gtrsim$ 5 TeV) or a large negative $A_0$ ($\lesssim$ -5 TeV) is needed to generate
the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs, while the stops, higgsinos and other Higgs bosons, mainly determined
by a large $|M_3|$, should be rather heavy; (ii) When $M_3$ is negative, we can obtain small contribution
to $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and large contribution to the muon g-2 (with 200-500 GeV smuons) even with
a light CP-odd Higgs ($\sim$ 2 TeV) and a medium $\tan\beta$ (20-40); (iii) To obtain the required
DM relic density, the annihilating mechanisms should be stau exchanging, stau coannihilating,
chargino coannihilating, slepton annihilating and the combination of two or three of them; (iv)
The spin-independent DM-nucleon cross section is typically much smaller than the present limits
of XENON1T 2018 and also an order of magnitude lower than the future detection sensitivity of LZ and
XENONnT experiments.
