The study of pion production in nuclei is important for signal and background determinations in
current and future neutrino oscillation experiments. The first step, however, is to understand
the pion production reactions at the free nucleon level. We present an exhaustive study of the charged-current
and neutral-current neutrino and antineutrino pion production off nucleons, paying a special
attention to the angular distributions of the outgoing pion. We show, using general arguments,
that parity violation and time-reversal odd correlations in the weak differential cross sections
are generated from the interference between different contributions to the hadronic current that
are not relatively real. Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of the art, microscopic
models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and we also confront their predictions with
polarized electron data, as a test of the vector content of these models. We also illustrate the importance
of carrying out a comprehensive test at the level of outgoing pion angular distributions, going
beyond comparisons done for partially integrated cross sections, where model differences cancel
to a certain extent. Finally, we observe that all charged and neutral current distributions show
sizable anisotropies, and identify channels for which parity violating effects are clearly visible.
Based on the above results, we conclude that the use of isotropic distributions for the pions in the
center of mass of the final pion-nucleon system, as assumed by some of the Monte Carlo event generators,
needs to be improved by incorporating the findings of microscopic calculations.
