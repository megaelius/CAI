We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the pre- and post-reconstruction
galaxy power spectrum multipoles from the final data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS). Geometric constraints are obtained from the positions of BAO peaks in reconstructed
spectra, analyzed in combination with the unreconstructed spectra in a full-shape (FS) likelihood
using a joint covariance matrix, giving stronger parameter constraints than FS-only or BAO-only
analyses. We introduce a new method for obtaining constraints from reconstructed spectra based
on a correlated theoretical error, which is shown to be simple, robust, and applicable to any flavor
of density-field reconstruction. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM with massive neutrinos, we analyze data
from two redshift bins $z_\mathrm{eff}=0.38,0.61$ and obtain $1.6\%$ constraints on the Hubble
constant $H_0$, using only a single prior on the current baryon density $\omega_b$ from Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and no knowledge of the power spectrum slope $n_s$. This gives $H_0 = 68.6\pm1.1\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
with the inclusion of BAO data sharpening the measurement by $40\%$, representing one of the strongest
current constraints on $H_0$ independent of cosmic microwave background data. Restricting to
the best-fit slope $n_s$ from Planck (but without additional priors on the spectral shape), we obtain
a $1\%$ $H_0$ measurement of $67.8\pm 0.7\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find
strong constraints on the cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of the FS, BAO, and Planck
data. This sets new bounds on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu < 0.14\,\mathrm{eV}$ (at $95\%$
confidence) and the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_\mathrm{eff} = 2.90^{+0.15}_{-0.16}$,
though contours are not appreciably narrowed by the inclusion of BAO data.
