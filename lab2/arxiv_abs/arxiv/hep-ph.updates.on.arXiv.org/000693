Neutrino-nucleus scattering $\nu A\to \nu A$, in which the nucleus conserves its integrity, is
considered. We show that elastic interactions keeping the nucleus in the same quantum state lead
to a quadratic enhancement of the corresponding cross-section in terms of the number of nucleons.
Meanwhile, the cross-section of inelastic processes in which the quantum state of the nucleus is
changed, essentially has a linear dependence on the number of nucleons. These two classes of processes
are referred to as coherent and incoherent, respectively. The coherent and incoherent cross-sections
are driven by factors $|F_{p/n}|^2$ and $(1-|F_{p/n}|^2)$, where $|F_{p/n}|^2$ is a proton/neutron
form-factor of the nucleus, averaged over its initial states. The coherent cross-section formula
used in the literature is revised and corrections depending on kinematics are estimated. As an illustration
of the importance of the incoherent channel we considered three experimental setups with different
nuclei. Experiments attempting to measure coherent neutrino scattering by solely detecting the
recoiling nucleus, as is typical, might be including an incoherent background that is indistinguishable
from the signal if the excitation gamma eludes its detection. However, as is shown here, the incoherent
component can be measured directly by searching for photons released by the excited nuclei inherent
to the incoherent channel. For a beam experiment these gammas should be correlated in time with the
beam, and their higher energies make the corresponding signal easily detectable at a rate governed
by the ratio of incoherent to coherent cross-sections. The detection of signals due to the nuclear
recoil and excitation gammas provides a more sensitive instrument in studies of nuclear structure
and possible signs of new physics.
