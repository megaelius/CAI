The Seebeck effect and Nernst effect, reflecting the appearances of a longitudinal electric field
and a transverse electric field, $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$, induced by a longitudinal thermal gradient,
respectively, are theoretically studied in QGP at a perpendicular magnetic field placed in $z$-axis.
The calculations of associated Seebeck coefficient ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst signal ($N$) are performed
using the relativistic Boltzmann equation under relaxation time approximation. In an isotropic
QGP, the influences of magnetic field ($B$) and quark chemical potential ($\mu_{q}$) on these thermoelectric
transport coefficients are investigated. In the presence (absence) of weak magnetic field, we
find $S_{xx}$ for a fixed $\mu_{q}$ is negative (positive) in sign, indicating dominant carriers
that convert heat gradient to electric field are negatively (positively) charged quarks. The absolute
value of $S_{xx}$ decreases with increasing temperature. Unlike $S_{xx}$, the sign of $N$ is dependent
of charge carrier type and its thermal behavior displays a peak structure. In the presence of strong
magnetic field, the motions of (anti-)quarks can be quantized to Landau level states, only the Seebeck
coefficient along the direction of magnetic field, $S_{zz}$, is concentrated in this work. The
results show that the value of $S_{zz}$ at a fixed $\mu_{q}$ always remains positive. Compared to
in lowest Landau level approximation, $S_{zz}$ within the effect of higher Landau levels has a significant
enhancement eventhough the increment can be slightly suppressed as Landau level increases. The
computation of these thermoelectric transport coefficients also extends to a medium with momentum
anisotropy induced by initial spatial expansion and strong magnetic field.
