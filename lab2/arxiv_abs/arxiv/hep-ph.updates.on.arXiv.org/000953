Based on the precise nuclei data released by AMS-02, we study the spectra hardening of both the primary
(proton, helium, carbon, oxygen, and the primary component of nitrogen) and the secondary (anti-proton,
lithium, beryllium, boron and the secondary component of nitrogen) cosmic ray (CR) nuclei. With
the diffusion-reacceleration model, we consider two schemes to reproduce the hardening in the
spectra: (i) A high-rigidity break in primary source injection; (ii) A high-rigidity break in diffusion
coefficient. The global fitting results show that both schemes could reproduce the spectra hardening
in current status. More precise multi-TV data (especially the data of secondary CR species) is needed
if one wants to distinguish these two schemes. In our global fitting, each of the nuclei species is
allocated an independent solar modulation potential and a re-scale factor (which accounts for
the isotopic abundance for primary nuclei species and uncertainties of production cross section
or inhomogeneity of CR sources and propagation for secondary nuclei species). The fitting values
of these two parameter classes show us some hints on some new directions in CR physics. All the fitted
re-scale factors of primary nuclei species have values that systematically smaller than 1.0, while
that of secondary nuclei species are systematically larger than 1.0. Moreover, both the re-scale
factor and solar modulation potential of beryllium have values which are obviously different from
other species. This might indicate that beryllium has the specificity not only on its propagation
in the heliosphere, but also on its production cross section. All these new results should be seriously
studied in the future.
