We consider a class of $b-\tau$ Yukawa unified Supersymmetric (SUSY) $SU(5)$ GUTs, in which the
asymptotic gaugino $M_{1,2,3}$ masses are generated through a combination of gravity and mirage
mediated supersymmetry breaking. Due to the contributions from mirage mediation, $M_{3}$ is always
lighter than M_{1} and M_{2}, and consequently for the range of asymptotic masses considered, the
gluino mass at low scale is bounded from above at about 4 TeV. We realize two different regions, one
in which the MSSM $\mu-$term is less than about 3 TeV. This region yields a stop mass up to 5 TeV, and
the stop mass is nearly degenerate with the LSP neutralino for mass around 0.8 to 1.7 TeV. A stau mass
can be realized up to about 5 TeV, and the stau mass is approximately degenerate with the LSP neutralino
for mass around 2 to 3 TeV. In addition, an A-funnel solution $m_{A}$ with mass $\sim 1.4-1.8$ TeV
is realized. A second region, on the other hand, arises for gluino around 1.1 TeV. The $\mu-$term
is rather large than 20 TeV, and the LSP neutralino is a bino-wino mixture. The gluino mass ($\sim
0.8-1.2$ TeV) is nearly degenerate with the LSP neutralino mass and hence, the gluino-neutralino
coannihilation processes play a role in reducing the relic abundance of LSP neutralino down to ranges
allowed by the current WMAP measurements. The two regions above can be distinguished through the
direct detection experiments. The first region with relatively low $\mu$ values yields Higgsino-like
DM, whose scattering on the nucleus typically has a large cross-section. We find that such solutions
are still allowed by the current results from the LUX experiment, and they will be severely tested
by the LUX-Zeplin experiment. The second region contains bino-wino DM whose scattering cross-section
is relatively low. These solutions are harder to rule out in the foreseeable future.
