This is the third out of five chapters of the final report [1] of the Workshop on Physics at HL-LHC,
and perspectives on HE-LHC [2]. It is devoted to the study of the potential, in the search for Beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) physics, of the High Luminosity (HL) phase of the LHC, defined as $3~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$
of data taken at a centre-of-mass energy of $14~\mathrm{TeV}$, and of a possible future upgrade,
the High Energy (HE) LHC, defined as $15~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ of data at a centre-of-mass energy of
$27~\mathrm{TeV}$. We consider a large variety of new physics models, both in a simplified model
fashion and in a more model-dependent one. A long list of contributions from the theory and experimental
(ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) communities have been collected and merged together to give a complete, wide,
and consistent view of future prospects for BSM physics at the considered colliders. On top of the
usual standard candles, such as supersymmetric simplified models and resonances, considered
for the evaluation of future collider potentials, this report contains results on dark matter and
dark sectors, long lived particles, leptoquarks, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, heavy
scalars, vector-like quarks, and more. Particular attention is placed, especially in the study
of the HL-LHC prospects, to the detector upgrades, the assessment of the future systematic uncertainties,
and new experimental techniques. The general conclusion is that the HL-LHC, on top of allowing to
extend the present LHC mass and coupling reach by $20-50\%$ on most new physics scenarios, will also
be able to constrain, and potentially discover, new physics that is presently unconstrained. Moreover,
compared to the HL-LHC, the reach in most observables will generally more than double at the HE-LHC,
which may represent a good candidate future facility for a final test of TeV-scale new physics.
