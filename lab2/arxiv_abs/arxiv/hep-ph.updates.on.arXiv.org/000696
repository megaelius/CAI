In this paper, the production of the charged Higgs pair associated with the $Z^0$ boson is analyzed
in the minimal extension of the standard model the so-called two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). The
process $e^+e^- \rightarrow H^+H^-Z^0$ is calculated at the tree level including all the possible
diagrams in 2HDM. The numerical analysis is performed in consideration of the current experimental
constraints and various scenarios for the free parameters of the model. The results are presented
as a function of center-of-mass energy, the charged Higgs mass ($m_{H^\pm}$), and the ratio of the
vacuum expectation values ($t_\beta$). The unpolarized cross section, taking into account the
results in the flavor physics, gets up to $0.278\text{ fb}$ for $m_{H^\pm}=175\text{ GeV}$, and
it declines with decreasing $m_{H^\pm}$ in Type-I. However, it gets down to $0.073\text{ fb}$ for
$m_{H^\pm}=500\text{ GeV}$ in Type-II. Further, the calculation is also carried out in the non-alignment
scenario and low-$m_{h^0}$ scenario. The effect of the polarized incoming $e^+$ and $e^-$ beams
shows that the cross section is enhanced by a factor up to 2.5 at P(+0.60,-0.80) polarization configuration.
Decay channels of the charged Higgs, possible final states of the process, and some differential
distributions belong to the charged Higgs and $Z^0$ boson are examined for each scenario. The analysis
shows that some channels have higher branching ratio such as $H^+\rightarrow t \bar{b}$, $H^+\rightarrow
W^+h^0$, and $H^+\rightarrow W^+H^0$. These decay channels are essential for the charged Higgs
searches in the lepton colliders regarding the scenarios interested. The detection of the charged
Higgs is a powerful sign for the extended scalar sectors, and the results show the potential of a future
lepton collider.
