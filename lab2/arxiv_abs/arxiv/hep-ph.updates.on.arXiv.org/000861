The Standard Model (SM)-like couplings of the observed Higgs boson impose strong constraints on
the structure of any extended Higgs sector. We consider the theoretical properties and the phenomenological
implications of a generic two Higgs doublet model (2HDM). This model constitutes a simple and attractive
extension of the SM that is consistent with the observation of the SM-like Higgs boson and precision
electroweak observables, while providing a potential new source of CP-violation. In this paper
we focus on the so-called Higgs alignment limit of the generic 2HDM, where the neutral scalar field~$H_1$,
with the tree-level couplings of the SM Higgs boson, is a mass eigenstate that is aligned in field
space with the direction of the Higgs vacuum expectation value. The properties of the two other heavier
neutral Higgs scalars, $H_2$ and $H_3$, in the alignment limit of the 2HDM are also elucidated. It
is shown that the couplings of $H_2$ and $H_3$ in the alignment limit are tightly constrained and
correlated. For example, in the exact alignment limit at tree level, for bosonic final states $\text{BR}(H_{2,3}
\to W^+W^-, ZZ, H_1 Z) = 0$ and $\text{BR}(H^\pm \to W^\pm H_1) = 0$, whereas for fermionic final states
$\Gamma(H_2 \to f\bar f)/\Gamma(H_3 \to f\bar f) \sim M_2/M_3$ (where $M_\alpha$ is the mass of
$H_\alpha$). In some cases, the results of the alignment limit differ depending on whether or not
alignment is achieved via the decoupling of heavy scalar states. In particular, in the exact alignment
limit without decoupling $\text{BR}(H_{2,3}\to H_1 H_1)=0$, whereas these branching ratios
are nonzero in the decoupling regime. Observables that could be used to test the alignment scenario
at the LHC are defined and discussed. The couplings of the Higgs bosons away from their exact alignment
values are determined to leading order, and some consequences are elucidated.
