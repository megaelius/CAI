Precise knowledge of the nucleon's axial-current form factors is crucial for modeling GeV-scale
neutrino-nucleus interactions. Unfortunately, the axial form factor remains insufficiently
constrained to meet the precision requirements of upcoming long-baseline neutrino-oscillation
experiments. This work studies the nucleon's axial and vector form factors using the light-front
approach to build a quark-diquark model of the nucleon with an explicit pion cloud. The light-front
wave functions in both the quark and pion-baryon Fock spaces are first calibrated to existing experimental
information on the nucleon's electromagnetic form factors, and then used to predict the axial form
factor. The resulting squared charge radius of the axial pseudo-vector form factor is predicted
to be $r_A^2\! =\! 0.29\! \pm\! 0.03\, \mathrm{fm}^2$, where the small error accounts for the model's
parametric uncertainty. We use our form factor results to explore the (quasi-)elastic scattering
of neutrinos by (nuclei)nucleons, with the result that the the widely-implemented dipole ansatz
is an inadequate approximation of the full form factor for modeling both processes. The approximation
leads to a $5\!-\!10\%$ over-estimation of the total cross section, depending on the (anti)neutrino
energy. We project over-estimations of similar size in the flux-averaged cross sections for the
upcoming DUNE long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiment. section, depending on the (anti)neutrino
