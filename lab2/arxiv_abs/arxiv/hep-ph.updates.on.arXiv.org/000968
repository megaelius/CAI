Heavy-quark symmetry as applied to heavy hadron systems implies that their interactions are independent
of their heavy-quark spin (heavy-quark spin symmetry) and heavy flavour contents (heavy flavour
symmetry). In the molecular hypothesis the $X(3872)$ resonance is a $1^{++}$ $D^*\bar{D}$ bound
state. If this is the case, the application of heavy-quark symmetry to a molecular $X(3872)$ suggests
the existence of a series of partner states, the most obvious of which is a possible $2^{++}$ $D^*\bar{D}^*$
bound state for which the two-body potential is identical to that of the $1^{++}$ $D^*\bar{D}$ system,
the reason being that these two heavy hadron-antihadron states have identical light-spin content.
As already discussed in the literature this leads to the prediction of a partner state at $4012\,{\rm
MeV}$, at least in the absence of other dynamical effects which might affect the location of this
molecule. However the prediction of further heavy-quark symmetry partners cannot be done solely
on the basis of symmetry and requires additional information. We propose to use the one boson exchange
model to fill this gap, in which case we will be able to predict or discard the existence of other partner
states. Besides the isoscalar $2^{++}$ $D^*\bar{D}^*$ bound state, we correctly reproduce the
location and quantum numbers of the isovector hidden-bottom $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ molecular
candidates. We also predict the hidden-bottom $1^{++}$ $B^*\bar{B}^*$ and $2^{++}$ $B^*\bar{B}^*$
partners of the $X(3872)$, in agreement with previous theoretical speculations, plus a series
of other states. The isoscalar, doubly charmed $1^+$ $D D^*$ and $D^* D^*$ molecules and their doubly
bottomed counterparts are likely to bind, providing a few instances of explicitly exotic systems.
