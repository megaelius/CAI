By solving the Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es integral equations, the scalar form factors of the semileptonic
heavy meson decays $D\to\pi \bar \ell \nu_\ell$, $D\to \bar{K} \bar \ell \nu_\ell$, $\bar{B}\to
\pi \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ and $\bar{B}_s\to K \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ are simultaneously studied. As
input, we employ unitarized heavy meson-Goldstone boson chiral coupled-channel amplitudes for
the energy regions not far from thresholds, while, at high energies, adequate asymptotic conditions
are imposed. The scalar form factors are expressed in terms of Omn\`es matrices multiplied by vector
polynomials, which contain some undetermined dispersive subtraction constants. We make use of
heavy quark and chiral symmetries to constrain these constants, which are fitted to lattice QCD
results both in the charm and the bottom sectors, and in this latter sector to the light-cone sum rule
predictions close to $q^2=0$ as well. We find a good simultaneous description of the scalar form
factors for the four semileptonic decay reactions. From this combined fit, and taking advantage
that scalar and vector form factors are equal at $q^2=0$, we obtain $|V_{cd}|=0.244\pm 0.022$,
$|V_{cs}|=0.945\pm 0.041$ and $|V_{ub}|=(4.3\pm 0.7)\times10^{-3}$ for the involved Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) matrix elements. In addition, we predict the following vector form factors at $q^2=0$: $|f_+^{D\to\eta}(0)|=0.01\pm
0.05$, $|f_+^{D_s\to K}(0)|=0.50 \pm 0.08$, $|f_+^{D_s\to\eta}(0)|=0.73\pm 0.03$ and $|f_+^{\bar{B}\to\eta}(0)|=0.82
\pm 0.08$, which might serve as alternatives to determine the CKM elements when experimental measurements
of the corresponding differential decay rates become available. Finally, we predict the different
form factors above the $q^2-$regions accessible in the semileptonic decays, up to moderate energies
amenable to be described using the unitarized coupled-channel chiral approach.
