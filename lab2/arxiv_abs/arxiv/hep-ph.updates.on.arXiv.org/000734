It is shown that odd harmonic azimuthal correlations, including the directed flow $v_1$, in forward
two-particle production in peripheral proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions can arise simply from
the radial nuclear profile of a large nucleus. This requires consideration of the C-odd part of the
gluonic generalized transverse momentum dependent (GTMD) correlator of nucleons in the nucleus.
The gluonic GTMD correlator is the Fourier transform of an off-forward hadronic matrix element
containing gluonic field strength tensors that are connected by gauge links. It is parametrized
in terms of various gluon GTMD distribution functions (GTMDs). We show (in a gauge invariant way)
that for the relevant dipole-type gauge link structure in the small-$x$ limit the GTMD correlator
reduces to a generalized Wilson loop correlator. The Wilson loop correlator is parametrized in
terms of a single function, implying that in the region of small $x$ there is only one independent
dipole-type GTMD, which can have a C-odd part. We show that the odderon Wigner distribution, which
is related to this C-odd dipole GTMD by a Fourier transform, generates odd harmonics in the two-particle
azimuthal correlations in peripheral $pA$ collisions. We calculate the first odd harmonic $v_1$
for forward production within the color glass condensate framework in the limit of a large number
of colors. We find that nonzero odd harmonics are present without breaking the rotational symmetry
of the nucleus, arising just from its inhomogeneity in the radial direction. Using a CGC model with
a cubic action, we illustrate that percent level $v_1$ can arise from this C-odd mechanism. In contrast,
we show that only even harmonics arise in diffractive dijet production in ultra-peripheral $pA$
collisions where this gluon dipole GTMD also appears.
