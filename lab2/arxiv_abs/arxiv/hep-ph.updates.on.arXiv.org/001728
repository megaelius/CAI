Using consistency requirements relating chiral condensates imposed by the so called Generalized
Konishi Anomaly, we show that dimensional transmutation via gaugino condensation {\emph{in the
ultraviolet}} drives gauge symmetry breaking in a large class of {\emph{asymptotically strong}}
Super Yang Mills Higgs theories. For Adjoint multiplet type chiral superfields $\Phi$ (transforming
as $r \times \bar r$ representations of a non Abelian gauge group G), solution of the Generalized
Konishi Anomaly(GKA) equations allows calculation of quantum corrected VEVs in terms of the dimensional
transmutation scale $\Lambda_{UV} \simeq M_X \, e^{\frac{8\pi^2}{ g^2(M_X) b_0}} $ which determines
the gaugino condensate. Thus the gauge coupling at the perturbative unification scale $M_X$ generates
GUT symmetry breaking VEVs by non-perturbative dimensional transmutation. This obviates the
need for large(or any) input mass scales in the superpotential. Rank reduction can be achieved by
including pairs of chiral superfields transforming as either $({\bf Q}(r),{ \bf\bar Q}(\bar r))$
or $ (\Sig((r\otimes r)_{symm})), \Sigb(({\bar r \otimes\bar r})_{symm})$, that form trilinear
matrix gauge invariants $\bar Q\cdot \Phi\cdot Q, \Sigb \cdot \Phi\cdot \Sig $ with $\Phi$. Novel,
robust and {\emph{ultraminimal}} Grand unification algorithms emerge from the analysis. We sketch
the structure of a realistic Spin(10) model, with the $16$-plet of Spin(10) as the base representation
$r$, which mimics the realistic Minimal Supersymmetric GUT but contains even fewer free parameters.
We argue that our results point to a large extension of the dominant and normative paradigms of Asymptotic
Freedom$/$IR colour confinement and potential driven spontaneous symmetry breaking that have
long ruled gauge theories.
