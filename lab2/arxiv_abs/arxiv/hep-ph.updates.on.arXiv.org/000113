The charged Higgs boson sector of the Minimal Manifest Left-Right Symmetric model (MLRSM) is investigated
in the context of LHC discovery search for new physics beyond Standard Model. We discuss and summarise
the main processes within MLRSM where heavy charged Higgs bosons can be produced at the LHC. We explore
the scenarios where the amplified signals due to relatively light charged scalars dominate against
heavy neutral $Z_2$ and charged gauge $W_2$ as well as heavy neutral Higgs bosons signals which are
dumped due to large vacuum expectation value $v_R$ of the right-handed scalar triplet. In particular,
production processes with one and two doubly charged Higgs bosons are considered. We further incorporate
the decays of those scalars leading to multi lepton signals at the LHC. Branching ratios for heavy
neutrino $N_R$, $W_2$ and $Z_2$ decay into charged Higgs bosons are calculated. These effects are
substantial enough and cannot be neglected. The tri- and four-lepton final states for different
benchmark points are analysed. Kinematic cuts are chosen in order to strength the leptonic signals
and decrease the Standard Model (SM) background. The results are presented using di-lepton invariant
mass and lepton-lepton separation distributions for the same sign (SSDL) and opposite sign (OSDL)
di-leptons as well as the charge asymmetry are also discussed. We have found that for considered
MLRSM processes tri-lepton and four-lepton signals are most important for their detection when
compared to the SM background. Both of the signals can be detected at 14 TeV collisions at the LHC with
integrated luminosity at the level of $300~fb^{-1}$ with doubly charged Higgs bosons up to approximately
600 GeV. Finally, possible extra contribution of the charged MLRSM scalar particles to the measured
Higgs to di-photon ($H_0^0 \to \gamma \gamma$) decay is computed and pointed out.
