We show that in order to obtain a successful description of the transverse momenta distribution
for charged particles in ion-ion collisions, one must include a thermal emission term. The temperature
of this emission $T_{\rm th}$ turns out to be proportional to the saturation scale, $T_{\rm th} =
1.8/2\pi \,Q_s$. The formalism for the calculation of the transverse momenta spectra in CGC/saturation
approach is developed, in which two stages of the process are seen: creation of the colour glass condensate,
and hadronization of the gluon jets. Our calculations are based on the observation that even for
small values of $p_T$, the main contribution in the integration over the dipole sizes stems from
the kinematic region in vicinity of the saturation momentum, where theoretically, we know the scattering
amplitude. Non-perturbativ corrections need to be included in the model of hadronization. This
model incorporates the decay of a gluon jet with effective mass $m^2_{\rm eff} = 2 Q_s \mu_{\rm soft}$
where $\mu_{\rm soft}$ denotes the soft scale, with the fragmentation functions at all values of
the transverse momenta. We use the KLN model which, provides a simple way to estimate the cross sections
for the different centrality classes. Comparing the results of this paper with the transverse distribution
in the proton-proton scattering, we see two major differences. First, a larger contribution of
the thermal radiation term is needed, in accord with higher parton densities of the produced colour
glass condensate. Second, even changing the model for the hadronization, without a thermal radiation
term, we fail to describe the $p_T$ spectrum. Consequently, we conjecture that theexistence of
the thermal radiation term is independent of the model of confinement.
