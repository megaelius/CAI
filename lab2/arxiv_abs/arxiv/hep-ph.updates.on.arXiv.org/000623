As a sequel of our preceding work[1], we carry out a comprehensive comparative study between the
quasi parton distribution functions (PDFs), distribution amplitudes (DAs) and their light-cone
counterparts for various flavor-neutral mesons, in the context of the 't Hooft model, that is, the
two-dimensional QCD in the large $N$ limit. In contrast to the original derivation via diagrammatic
techniques exemplified by Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations, here we employ the Hamiltonian
operator approach to reconstruct the celebrated 't Hooft equation in light-front quantization,
and Bars-Green equations in equal-time quantization. The novelty of our derivation is to employ
the soft momentum cutoff as the IR regulator. As a virtue of this operator approach, the functional
form of the quasi distributions can be transparently built out of the Bars-Green wave functions
and the Bogoliubov angle with the aid of bosonization technique. Equipped with various bound-state
wave functions numerically inferred in Ref.[1], we then investigate how rapidly the quasi distributions
approach their light-cone counterparts with the increasing meson momentum. We observe that, light
mesons' quasi distributions approach the light-cone distributions in a slower pace than the heavy
quarkonia. Curiously, lattice simulations of quasi distributions in four-dimensional QCD also
discover this feature. Furthermore, we also compute the partonic light-cone PDF and quasi-PDF
to one-loop order in perturbation theory, again employing the momentum cutoff as the IR regulator.
We explicitly verify one of the backbones underlying the Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET),
namely, both quasi-PDFs and light-cone PDFs in ${\rm QCD}_2$ indeed possess the same IR behavior
at leading order in $1/P^z$.
