The $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies observed in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau\nu$ decays have attracted much
attention in recent years. In this paper, we study the $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau\nu$, $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c\tau\nu$,
$B_c\to (J/\psi,\,\eta_c)\tau\nu$, $B\to X_c\tau\nu$, and $B_c\to\tau\nu$ decays, all being
mediated by the same quark-level $b\to c\tau\nu$ transition, in the Standard Model Effective Field
Theory. The most relevant dimension-six operators for these processes are $Q_{lq}^{(3)}$, $Q_{ledq}$,
$Q^{(1)}_{lequ}$, and $Q^{(3)}_{lequ}$ in the Warsaw basis. Evolution of the corresponding Wilson
coefficients from the new physics scale $\Lambda=1$~TeV down to the characteristic scale $\mu_b\simeq
m_b$ is performed at three-loop in QCD and one-loop in EW/QED. It is found that, after taking into
account the constraint ${\cal B}(B_c\to\tau\nu)\lesssim 10\%$, a single $\left[C_{lq}^{(3)}\right]_{3323}(\Lambda)$
or $\left[C^{(3)}_{lequ}\right]_{3332}(\Lambda)$ can still be used to resolve the $R(D^{(\ast)})$
anomalies at $1\sigma$, while a single $\left[C^{(1)}_{lequ}\right]_{3332}(\Lambda)$ is already
ruled out by the measured $R(D^{(\ast)})$ at more than $3\sigma$. By minimizing the $\chi^2(C_i)$
function constructed based on the current data on $R(D)$, $R(D^\ast)$, $P_\tau(D^\ast)$, $R(J/\psi)$,
and $R(X_c)$, we obtain eleven most trustworthy scenarios, each of which can provide a good explanation
of the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies at $1\sigma$. To further discriminate these different scenarios,
we predict thirty-one observables associated with the processes considered under each NP scenario.
It is found that most of the scenarios can be differentiated from each other by using these observables
and their correlations.
