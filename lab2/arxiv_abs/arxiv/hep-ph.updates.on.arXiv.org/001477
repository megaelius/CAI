Exact 2D analytic expressions for E and B fields and their potentials created by a linear beam of relativistic
charged particles between infinite perfectly conductive plates and ferromagnetic poles are derived.
The solutions are obtained by summing an infinite sequence of fields from linear charge-images
and current-images in complex space. Knowledge of the normal component of the E field on the conductor
surface makes it possible to calculate the induced electric charge surface density. In addition,
we derive within an improved linear approximation new analytical expressions for fields near the
beam in the case of an arbitrary beam offset from the median plane. The mathematical features of exact
solutions and limitations for the applicability of linear approximations are specified.The primary
goals of the future high-luminosity p-p and heavy-ion LHC programme are the search for yet unobserved
effects of physics beyond the SM, searches for rare or low-sensitivity processes in the Higgs sector,
and probing in more detail the mechanism of EW symmetry breaking. This programme relies on the stable
operation of the accelerator. However, as the beam luminosity increases, a number of destabilizing
phenomena occur, in particular field emission, enhancing the electron cloud effect. For the case
of a proton beam, we apply the exact 2D solution for estimating the intensity of electron field emission
activated by the electric field of the beam in collimators of the future high-luminosity LHC. Calculation
shows that the field emission intensity is very sensitive to a collimator surface roughness. In
addition, with a relatively small and accidental beam displacement from the median path, about
20% of the collimator half-gap, the emission intensity increases by a factor of 1.E+7. This will
partially neutralize the beam space charge, violating acceleration dynamics and enhancing instability
effects.
