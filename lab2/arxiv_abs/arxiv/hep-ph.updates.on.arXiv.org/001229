Extensions of the standard model with a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry contain gauge invariant kinetic mixing,
$\sin\chi$, and gauge non-invariant mass mixing, $\delta M^2$, between the hypercharge and the
new gauge boson $Z'$. These represent a priori incalculable but phenomenologically important
parameters of the theory. They become calculable if there exist spontaneously or softly broken
symmetries which forbid them at tree level but allow their generation at the loop level. We discuss
various symmetries falling in this category in the context of the gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models
and their interplay with lepton mixing. It is shown that one gets phenomenologically inconsistent
lepton mixing parameters if these symmetries are exact. Spontaneous breaking of these symmetries
can lead to consistent lepton mixing and also generates finite and calculable values of these parameters
at one or two loop order depending on the underlying symmetry. We calculate these parameters in two
specific cases: (i) the standard seesaw model with $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry broken by the masses of
the right-handed neutrinos and (ii) in a model containing a pair of vectorlike charged leptons which
break $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry. In case (i), the right-handed neutrinos are the only source of gauge
mixing. The kinetic mixing parameters are suppressed and vanish if the right-handed neutrinos
decouple from the theory. In contrast, there exists a finite gauge mixing in case (ii) which survives
even when the masses of vectorlike leptons are taken to infinity, exhibiting non-decoupling behaviour.
The seesaw model discussed here represents a complete framework with practically no kinetic mixing
and hence can survive a large number of experimental probes used to rule out specific ranges in the
coupling $g^\prime$ and mass $M_{Z^\prime}$. The model can generate non-universality in tau decays,
which can be tested in future experiments.
