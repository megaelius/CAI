We consider the constraints from Supernova 1987A on particles with small couplings to the Standard
Model. We discuss a model with a fermion coupled to a dark photon, with various mass relations in the
dark sector; millicharged particles; dark-sector fermions with inelastic transitions; the hadronic
QCD axion; and an axion-like particle that couples to Standard Model fermions with couplings proportional
to their mass. In the fermion cases, we develop a new diagnostic for assessing when such a particle
is trapped at large mixing angles. Our bounds for a fermion coupled to a dark photon constrain small
couplings and masses <200 MeV, and do not decouple for low fermion masses. They exclude parameter
space that is otherwise unconstrained by existing accelerator-based and direct-detection searches.
In addition, our bounds are complementary to proposed laboratory searches for sub-GeV dark matter,
and do not constrain several "thermal" benchmark-model targets. For a millicharged particle,
we exclude charges between 10^(-9) to a few times 10^(-6) in units of the electron charge; this excludes
parameter space to higher millicharges and masses than previous bounds. For the QCD axion and an
axion-like particle, we apply several updated nuclear physics calculations and include the energy
dependence of the optical depth to accurately account for energy loss at large couplings. We rule
out a hadronic axion of mass between 0.1 and a few hundred eV, or equivalently bound the PQ scale between
a few times 10^4 and 10^8 GeV, closing the hadronic axion window. For an axion-like particle, our
bounds disfavor decay constants between a few times 10^5 GeV up to a few times 10^8 GeV. In all cases,
our bounds differ from previous work by more than an order of magnitude across the entire parameter
space. We also provide estimated systematic errors due to the uncertainties of the progenitor.
