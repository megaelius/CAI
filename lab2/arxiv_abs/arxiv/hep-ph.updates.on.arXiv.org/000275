We study the dynamic critical exponent from effective and microscopic theories. We employ a simple
TDGL model, or model A in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin, as an effective theory and
the imaginary time formalism of the finite-temperature filed theory as a microscopic theory. Taking
an O(N) scalar model as an example and carrying out the 1/N expansion up to the NLO in the 1PI and 2PI
effective actions, we compare the low-energy and low-momentum behavior of the response function
in the effective theory and of the retarded Green's function in the microscopic theory. At the NLO
of the 1PI 1/N expansion the low-energy and low-momentum behavior of the two-point function is very
much different in the microscopic and effective theories: in the field theory it is dominated by
the propagating mode while in model A it is dominated by the diffusive mode. Also, in the microscopic
theory the dynamic critical exponent, z, depends on whether the kinematics is relativistic or nonrelativistic.
In contrast, at the NLO of the 2PI 1/N expansion the microscopic and effective theories are equivalent.
They satisfy exactly the same Kadanoff-Baym equation. Also, whether the kinematics is relativistic
or nonrelativistic in the microscopic theory becomes irrelevant. This implies that the diffusive
mode with z = 2 + O(1/N) is dominant at low energies and momenta even in the microscopic theory at the
NLO of the 2PI 1/N expansion, though we do not explicitly solve the Kadanoff-Baym equation. We also
try to improve the calculation of the dynamic critical exponent of model A by incorporating the static
2PI NLO correlations. The obtained critical exponent is slightly smaller than the previous result
and its N dependence is also milder than the previous one.
