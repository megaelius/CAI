A new fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS accelerator is proposed that will use decays of charm
mesons to search for Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs), which are right-handed partners of the Standard
Model neutrinos. The existence of such particles is strongly motivated by theory, as they can simultaneously
explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, account for the pattern of neutrino masses and oscillations
and provide a Dark Matter candidate. Cosmological constraints on the properties of HNLs now indicate
that the majority of the interesting parameter space for such particles was beyond the reach of the
previous searches at the PS191, BEBC, CHARM, CCFR and NuTeV experiments. For HNLs with mass below
2 GeV, the proposed experiment will improve on the sensitivity of previous searches by four orders
of magnitude and will cover a major fraction of the parameter space favoured by theoretical models.
The experiment requires a 400 GeV proton beam from the SPS with a total of 2x10^20 protons on target,
achievable within five years of data taking. The proposed detector will reconstruct exclusive
HNL decays and measure the HNL mass. The apparatus is based on existing technologies and consists
of a target, a hadron absorber, a muon shield, a decay volume and two magnetic spectrometers, each
of which has a 0.5 Tm magnet, a calorimeter and a muon detector. The detector has a total length of about
100 m with a 5 m diameter. The complete experimental set-up could be accommodated in CERN's North
Area. The discovery of a HNL would have a great impact on our understanding of nature and open a new
area for future research.
