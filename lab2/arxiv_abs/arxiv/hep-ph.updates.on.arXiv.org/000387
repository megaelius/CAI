Cosmic rays have extremely high particle energies (up to $10^{20}\;\text{eV}$) and are ideally
suited to search for violations of Lorentz invariance. We consider isotropic nonbirefringent
Lorentz violation in the photon sector and specialize to the case of a photon velocity larger than
the maximum attainable velocity of the standard fermions. Up to now, earth-based bounds on this
type of Lorentz violation have been determined from observations of TeV gamma rays. Here, we elaborate
on a novel approach to test Lorentz invariance with greatly improved sensitivity. This approach
is based on investigating extensive air showers which are induced by cosmic-ray particles in the
Earth's atmosphere. We study the impact of two Lorentz-violating decay processes on the longitudinal
development of air showers, notably the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum $X_\text{max}$.
Specifically, the two Lorentz-violating decay processes considered are photon decay into an electron-positron
pair and modified neutral-pion decay into two photons. We use Monte Carlo simulations performed
with the CONEX code, which was extended to include these two Lorentz-violating decay processes
at a magnitude still allowed by present bounds. Compared to standard physics, these Lorentz-violating
decay processes reduce the average $X_\text{max}$ for showers with primary energies above $10^{18}\;\text{eV}$
by an amount that is significantly larger than the average resolution of current air shower experiments.
Comparing to observations of the average $X_\text{max}$, new bounds on this type of Lorentz violation
are derived that improve previous earth-based bounds by more than three orders of magnitude. Prospects
of further studies are also discussed.
