We calculate the bag parameters for neutral $B$-meson mixing in and beyond the Standard Model, in
full four-flavour lattice QCD for the first time. We work on gluon field configurations that include
the effect of $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ sea quarks with the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action
at three values of the lattice spacing and with three $u/d$ quark masses going down to the physical
value. The valence $b$ quarks use the improved NRQCD action and the valence light quarks, the HISQ
action. Our analysis was blinded. Our results for the bag parameters for all five operators are the
most accurate to date. For the Standard Model operator between $B_s$ and $B_d$ mesons we find: $\hat{B}_{B_s}=1.232(53)$,
$\hat{B}_{B_d}=1.222(61)$. Combining our results with lattice QCD calculations of the decay
constants using HISQ quarks from the Fermilab/MILC collaboration and with experimental values
for $B_s$ and $B_d$ oscillation frequencies allows determination of the CKM elements $V_{ts}$
and $V_{td}$. We find $V_{ts} = 0.04189(93)$, $V_{td} = 0.00867(23)$ and $V_{ts}/V_{td} = 0.2071(27)$.
Our results agree well (within $2\sigma$) with values determined from CKM unitarity constraints
based on tree-level processes (only). Using a ratio to $\Delta M$ in which CKM elements cancel in
the Standard Model, we determine the branching fractions ${\text{Br}}(B_s\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-)
= 3.81(18) \times 10^{-9}$ and ${\text{Br}}(B_d\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-) = 1.031(54) \times 10^{-10}$.
We also give results for matrix elements of the operators $R_0$, $R_1$ and $\tilde{R}_1$ that contribute
to neutral $B$-meson width differences.
