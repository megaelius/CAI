We review some recent highlights from the applications of statistical-thermal models to different
experimental measurements and lattice QCD thermodynamics, that have been made during the last
decade. We start with a short review of the historical milestones on the path of constructing statistical-thermal
models for heavy-ion physics. We discovered that Heinz Koppe formulated in 1948 an almost complete
recipe for the statistical-thermal models. In 1950, Enrico Fermi generalized this statistical
approach, in which he started with a general cross-section formula and inserted into it simplifying
assumptions about the matrix element of the interaction process that likely reflects many features
of the high-energy reactions dominated by density in the phase space of final states. In 1964, Hagedorn
systematically analysed the high-energy phenomena using all tools of statistical physics and
introduced the concept of limiting temperature based on the statistical bootstrap model. It turns
to be quite often that many-particle systems can be studied with the help of statistical-thermal
methods. The analysis of yield multiplicities in high-energy collisions gives an overwhelming
evidence for the chemical equilibrium in the final state. The strange particles might be an exception,
as they are suppressed at lower beam energies. However, their relative yields fulfill statistical
equilibrium, as well. We review the equilibrium statistical-thermal models for particle production,
fluctuations and collective flow in heavy-ion experiments. We also review their reproduction
of the lattice QCD thermodynamics at vanishing and finite chemical potential. During the last decade,
five conditions have been suggested to describe the universal behavior of the chemical freeze out
parameters.
