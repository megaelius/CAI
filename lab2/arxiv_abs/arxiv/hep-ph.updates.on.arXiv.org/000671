Background: It has been proposed that the azimuthal distributions of heavy flavor quark-antiquark
pairs may be modified in the medium of a heavy-ion collision. Purpose: This work tests this proposition
through next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations of the azimuthal distribution, $d\sigma/d\phi$,
including transverse momentum broadening, employing $<k_T^2>$ and fragmentation in exclusive
$Q \bar Q$ pair production. While these studies were done for $p+p$, $p + \bar p$ and $p+$Pb collisions,
understanding azimuthal angle correlations between heavy quarks in these smaller, colder systems
is important for their interpretation in heavy-ion collisions. Methods: First, single inclusive
$p_T$ distributions calculated with the exclusive HVQMNR code are compared to those calculated
in the fixed-order next-to-leading logarithm approach. Next the azimuthal distributions are
calculated and sensitivities to $<k_T^2>$, $p_T$ cut, and rapidity are studied at $\sqrt{s} = 7$
TeV. Finally, calculations are compared to $Q \bar Q$ data in elementary $p+p$ and $p + \bar p$ collisions
at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and 1.96 TeV as well as to the nuclear modification factor $R_{p {\rm Pb}}(p_T)$
in $p+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV measured by ALICE. Results: The low $p_T$ ($p_T
< 10$ GeV) azimuthal distributions are very sensitive to the $k_T$ broadening and rather insensitive
to the fragmentation function. The NLO contributions can result in an enhancement at $\phi \sim
0$ absent any other effects. Agreement with the data was found to be good. Conclusions: The NLO calculations,
assuming collinear factorization and introducing $k_T$ broadening, result in significant modifications
of the azimuthal distribution at low $p_T$ which must be taken into account in calculations of these
distributions in heavy-ion collisions.
