The symmetron is a typical example of screened modified gravity, wherein the symmetron force is
dynamically suppressed in dense environments. This allows it to hide in traditional tests of gravity.
However, the past decade has seen great experimental progress towards measuring screened forces
in the laboratory or in space. Screening relies on nonlinearities in the equation of motion, which
significantly complicates the theoretical analysis of such forces. Here, we present a calculation
of the symmetron force between a dense plate and sphere surrounded by vacuum. This is done via semi-analytical
approaches in two limiting cases, based on the size of the sphere: large spheres are analyzed via
the proximity force approximation, whilst small spheres are treated as screened test particles.
In the intermediate regime we solve the problem numerically. Our results allow us to make contact
with Casimir force experiments, which often employ a plate and sphere configuration for practical
reasons, and may therefore be used to constrain symmetrons. We use our results to forecast constraints
on the symmetron's parameters for a hypothetical Casimir experiment that is based on the current
state of the art. The forecasts compare favorably to other leading laboratory tests of gravity,
particularly atom interferometry and bouncing neutrons. We thus conclude that near-future Casimir
experiments will be capable of placing tight new bounds on symmetrons. Our results for the symmetron
force are derived in a scale-invariant way, such that although we here focus on Casimir experiments,
they may be applied to any other plate-sphere system, ranging from microscopic to astrophysical
scales.
