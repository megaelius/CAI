In order to understand the nature of the accelerating expansion of the late-time universe, it is
important to experimentally determine whether dark energy is a cosmological constant or dynamical
in nature. If dark energy already exists prior to inflation, which is a reasonable assumption, then
one expects that a dynamical dark energy would leave some footprint in the anisotropy of the late-time
accelerated expansion. To demonstrate the viability of this notion, we invoke the quintessence
field with the exponential potential as one of the simplest dynamical dark energy models allowed
by observations. We investigate the effects of its quantum fluctuations (the physical origin of
the perturbation being isocurvature) generated during inflation and having fully positive correlation
with the primordial curvature perturbations, and estimate the anisotropy of the cosmic expansion
so induced. We show that the primordial amplitude of quantum fluctuations of quintessence field
{\delta\phi}_P can be related to the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and we calculate the perturbed luminosity
distance to first order and the associated luminosity distance power spectrum, which is an estimator
of anisotropicity of late-time accelerated expansion. We find that the gravitational potential
at large scales and late times is less decayed in QCDM compared to that in {\Lambda}CDM so that the
smaller the redshift and multipole, the more relative deficit of power in QCDM. Our results of luminosity
distance power spectrum also show the similar conclusions of suppression as that of the previous
investigation regarding the effect of quantum fluctuations of quintessence field on the CMB temperature
anisotropies.
