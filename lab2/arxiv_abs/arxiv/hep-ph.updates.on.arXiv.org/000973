The cosmic electron energy spectrum recently observed by the DAMPE experiment exhibits two interesting
features, including a break around 0.9 TeV and a sharp resonance near 1.4 TeV. In this analysis, we
propose a dark matter explanation to both exotic features seen by DAMPE. In our model, dark matter
annihilates in the galaxy via two different channels that lead to both a narrow resonance spectrum
near 1.4 TeV and electron excess events over an extended energy range thus generating the break structure
around TeV. The two annihilation channels are mediated by two gauge bosons that interact both with
dark matter and with the standard model fermions. Dark matter annihilations through the s-channel
process mediated by the heavier boson produce monoenergetic electron-positron pairs leading
to the resonance excess. The lighter boson has a mass smaller than the dark matter such that they can
be on-shell produced in dark matter annihilations in the galaxy; the lighter bosons in the final
state subsequently decay to generate the extended excess events due to the smeared electron energy
spectrum in this process. We further analyze constraints from various experiments, including
HESS, Fermi, AMS, and LHC, to the parameter space of the model where both excess events can be accounted
for. In order to interpret the two new features in the DAMPE data, dark matter annihilation cross
sections in the current galaxy are typically much larger than the canonical thermal cross section
needed for the correct dark matter relic abundance. This discrepancy, however, is remedied by the
nonperturbative Sommerfeld enhancement because of the existence of a lighter mediator in the model.
