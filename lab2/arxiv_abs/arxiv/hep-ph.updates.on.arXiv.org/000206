We consider cosmological inflationary models in which vector fields play some role in the generation
of the primordial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. Such models are interesting because the involved
vector fields naturally seed statistical anisotropy in the primordial fluctuations which eventually
could leave a measurable imprint on the CMB fluctuations. In this article, we estimate the size of
scale dependent effects on the non-Gaussianity (NG) parameters due to the scale dependent statistical
anisotropy in the distribution of the fluctuations. For concreteness, we use a power spectrum (PS)
of the fluctuations of the cuadrupolar form: $P_\zeta(\vec{k})\equiv P_\zeta(k)\left[1+g_\zeta(k)(\hat{n}
\cdot \hat{k})^2 \right]$, where $g_{\zeta}(k)$ is the only quantity which parametrizes the level
of statistical anisotropy and $\hat{n}$ is a unitary vector which points towards the preferred
direction. Then, we evaluate the contribution of the running of $g_{\zeta}(k)$ on the NG parameters
by means of the $\delta N$ formalism. We focus specifically in the details for the $f_{\rm NL}$ NG
parameter, associated to the bispectrum $B_\zeta$, but the structure of higher order NG parameters
is straightforward to generalize. Although the level of statistical anisotropy in the PS is severely
constrained by recent observations, the importance of statistical anisotropy signals in higher
order correlators remains to be determined, this being the main task that we address here. The precise
measurement of the running of statistical parameters such as the statistical anisotropy level
and the NG parameters could provide relevant elements for model building and for the determination
of the presence (or non presence) of inflationary vector fields and their role in the inflationary
mechanism.
