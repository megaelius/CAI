We study the perturbative stability of four settings that arise in String Theory, when dilaton potentials
accompany the breaking of Supersymmetry, in the USp(32) and U(32) orientifold models, and also
in the heterotic SO(16)xSO(16) model. The first two settings are a family of AdS3xS7 orientifold
vacua and a family of AdS7xS3 heterotic vacua, supported by form fluxes, with small world-sheet
and string-loop corrections within wide ranges of parameters. In both cases we find some unstable
scalar perturbations, as a result of mixings induced by fluxes, confirming for the first class of
vacua a previous result. However, in the second class they only affect the l=1 modes, so that a Z2 projection
induced by an overall internal parity suffices to eliminate them, leading to perturbative stability.
Moreover, the constant dilaton profiles of these vacua allow one to extend the analysis to generic
potentials, thus exploring the possible effects of higher-order corrections, and we exhibit wide
nearby regions of perturbative stability. The solutions in the third setting have nine-dimensional
Poincare' symmetry. They include regions with large world-sheet or string-loop corrections,
but we show that these vacua have no perturbative instabilities. Finally, the last setting concerns
cosmological solutions in ten dimensions where the "climbing" phenomenon takes place: they have
bounded string-loop corrections but large world-sheet ones close to the initial singularity.
We find that perturbations generally decay, but homogeneous tensor modes exhibit an interesting
logarithmic growth that signals a breakdown of isotropy. If the Universe then proceeds to lower
dimensions, milder potentials from other branes force all perturbations to remain bounded.
