Within the relativistic mean-field framework with hadron masses and coupling constants dependent
on the mean scalar field we study properties of nuclear matter at finite temperatures, baryon densities
and isospin asymmetries relevant for heavy-ion collisions at laboratory energies below 2$A$ GeV.
Previously constructed (KVORcut-based and MKVOR-based) models for the description of the cold
hadron matter, which differ mainly by the density dependence of the nucleon effective mass and symmetry
energy, are extended for finite temperatures. The baryon equation of state, which includes nucleons
and $\Delta$ resonances is supplemented by the contribution of the pion gas described either by
the vacuum dispersion relation or with taking into account the $s$-wave pion-baryon interaction.
Distribution of the charge between components is found. Thermodynamical characteristics on $T-n$
plane are considered. The energy-density and entropy-density isotherms are constructed and a
dynamical trajectory of the hadron system formed in heavy-ion collisions is described in these
terms. The effects of taking into account the $\Delta$ isobars and the $s$-wave pion-nucleon interaction
on pion differential cross sections, pion to proton and $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratios are studied. The liquid-gas
first-order phase transition is studied within the same models of the equation of state in isospin-symmetric
and asymmetric systems. We demonstrate that our models yield thermodynamic characteristics of
the phase transition compatible with available experimental results. In addition, we discuss
the scaled variance of baryon and electric charge in the phase transition region. Effect of the non-zero
surface tension on spatial redistribution of the electric charge is considered for a possible application
to heavy-ion collisions at low energies.
