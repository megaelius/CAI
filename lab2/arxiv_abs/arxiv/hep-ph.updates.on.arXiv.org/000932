Observables of neutrino oscillations in matter have, in general, contributions from the effective
matter potential. It contaminates the CP violation asymmetry adding a fake effect that has been
recently disentangled from the genuine one by their different behavior under T and CPT. Is the genuine
T-odd CPT-invariant component of the CP asymmetry coincident with the T asymmetry? Contrary to
CP, matter effects in uniform matter cannot induce by themselves a non-vanishing T asymmetry; however,
the question of the title remained open. We demonstrate that, in the presence of genuine CP violation,
there is a new non-vanishing CP-even, and so CPT-odd, component in the T asymmetry in matter, which
is of odd-parity in both the phase $\delta$ of the flavor mixing and the matter parameter $a$. The
two disentangled components, genuine $A^\mathrm{T;CP}_{\alpha\beta}$ and fake $A^\mathrm{T;CPT}_{\alpha\beta}$,
could be experimentally separated by the measurement of the two T asymmetries in matter ($\nu_\alpha
\leftrightarrow \nu_\beta$) and ($\bar\nu_\alpha \leftrightarrow \bar\nu_\beta$). For the
($\nu_\mu \leftrightarrow \nu_e$) transitions, the energy dependence of the new $A^\mathrm{T;CPT}_{\mu
e}$ component is like the matter-induced term $A^\mathrm{CP;CPT}_{\mu e}$ of the CP asymmetry
which is odd under a change of the neutrino mass hierarchy. We have thus completed the physics involved
in all observable asymmetries in matter by means of their disentanglement into the three independent
components, genuine $A^\mathrm{CP;T}_{\alpha\beta}$ and fake $A^\mathrm{CP;CPT}_{\alpha\beta}$
and $A^\mathrm{T;CPT}_{\alpha\beta}$.
