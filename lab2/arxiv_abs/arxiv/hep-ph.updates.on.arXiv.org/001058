A phenomenological constituent quark model which has been successfully applied to the study of
spectrum and electromagnetic, strong and weak decays and reactions of heavy quarkonia is used herein
to compute ground- and excited-state energies of all the $QQQ$ baryons containing either $c$- or
$b$-quarks. There is no experimental information of this kind of baryons and we believe that our
potential model prediction could help experimentalists to their quest of finding them since it
is expected that quark models describe triply-heavy baryons to a similar degree of accuracy as the
charmonium and bottomonium sectors. The three-body bound-state problem is solved by means of the
Gaussian expansion method which provides enough accuracy and simplifies the subsequent evaluation
of the matrix elements. We predict several low-lying states with quantum numbers $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{\pm}$,
$\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$, $\frac{5}{2}^{\pm}$ and $\frac{7}{2}^+$. There are lattice QCD results
for the low-energy spectrum of $\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons and our calculation
agrees nicely with them for the ground state masses. However, our computation of excited states
do not match lattice since its prediction is not reliable because radial excitations are few tens
of MeV above its ground state. No lattice data exist for $\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{cbb}$ sectors
and then we compare our spectrum with other theoretical formalisms; in fact, this is done for all
the $QQQ$ baryons containing either $c$- or $b$-quarks. There is a general trend of agreement between
the different theoretical approaches about what would be the lowest state in each sector and with
what mass. For the excited states, the predictions are scarce and scattered but, in general, our
results compare reasonably well when data exist.
