Conventionally invariant mass or transverse momentum techniques have been used to probe for any
formation of some exotic or unusual resonance states in high energy collision. In this work, we have
applied symmetry scaling based complex network approach to study exotic resonance/hadronic states
utilizing the clustering coefficients and associated scaling parameter extracted with the complex
network based technique of Visibility Graph. We have analyzed the data of Pb-Pb collision data sample
at 2.76 TeV from ALICE Collaboration and analyzed different patterns of symmetry scaling, scale-freeness,
correlation and clustering among the produced particles. This is a chaos-based complex network
technique where simple parameters like Average Clustering Coefficient and Power of Scale-freeness
of Visibility Graph(PSVG) may hint at formation of some exotic or unusual resonance states without
using conventional methods. From this experiment we may infer that highest range of Average clustering
coefficient, might be the resonance states/clusters from where the hadronic decay might have occurred
and few clusters with highest value of this parameter may indicate that those clusters may be the
ancestors of some strange particles. There have also been extensive study of dilepton production
since the study of lepton pair generation in Drell-Yan processes is immensely important as these
processes enable us to validate the Standard Model-SM predictions for the fundamental particles
interaction at the new energy region and also to probe for new physics beyond SM. Hence we have applied
the same methodology and extracted the same parameters for p-p collision data at 8TeV from CMS, to
detect possible resonance states eventually generating lepton pairs.
