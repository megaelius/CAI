We introduce three alternative angular variables-denoted by $\tilde{\omega}_\text{min}$,
$\hat{\omega}_\text{min}$, and $\chi_\text{min}$-for QCD multijet event suppression in supersymmetry
searches in events with large missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at the LHC
at CERN. In searches in all-hadronic final states in the CMS and ATLAS experiments, the angle $\Delta\varphi_i$,
the azimuthal angle between a jet and the missing transverse momentum, is widely used to reduce QCD
multijet background events with large missing transverse momentum, which is primarily caused
by a jet momentum mismeasurement or neutrinos in hadron decays-the missing transverse momentum
is aligned with a jet. A related angular variable-denoted by $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$, the
minimum of the azimuthal angles between a jet and the transverse momentum imbalance of the other
jets in the event-is used instead in a series of searches in all-hadronic final states in CMS to suppress
QCD multijet background events to a negligible level. In this paper, before introducing the alternative
variables, we review the variable $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$ in detail and identify room for
improvement, in particular, to maintain good acceptances for signal models with high jet multiplicity
final states. Furthermore, we demonstrate with simulated event samples that $\hat{\omega}_\text{min}$
and $\chi_\text{min}$ considerably outperform $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$ and $\Delta\varphi_i$
in rejecting QCD multijet background events and that $\hat{\omega}_\text{min}$ and $\tilde{\omega}_\text{min}$
are also useful for reducing the total standard model background events.
