We respond to two comments on our recent paper, Jeltema & Profumo (2014). The first comment by
Boyarsky et al. confirms the absence of a line from M31 in the 3-4 keV energy range, but criticizes
the energy range for spectral fitting on the basis that (i) the background model adopted between
3-4 keV is invalid outside that range and that (ii) extending the energy range multiple features
appear, including a 3.5 keV line. Point (i) is manifestly irrelevant (the 3-4 keV background model
was not meant to extend outside that range), while closer inspection of point (ii) shows that the
detected features are inconsistent and likely unphysical. We demonstrate that the existence of
an excess near 3.5 keV in the M31 data requires fitting a broad enough energy range such that the background
modeling near 3.5 keV is poor to a level that multiple spurious residual features become significant.
Bulbul et al. criticize our use of WebGuide instead of the full AtomDB package. While a technically
correct remark, this is only a red herring: our predictions are based on line ratios, and not on absolute
emissivities; line ratios, for atomic transitions with similar peak temperatures, are largely
temperature-independent, thus the line ratios we employed to draw our conclusions are substantially
correct. Bulbul et al. also present a new analysis of their data at lower energy, which excludes a
significant Cl contamination to the 3.5 keV line. Cl emission was however predicted to be subdominant
in our original study. Both of the Bulbul et al.'s criticisms are thus inconsequential to the conclusions
of our original study. Finally, we demonstrate that the multi-temperature models employed in Bulbul
et al. are, in fact, inconsistent, based on the Ca XX to Ca XIX line ratio: we show that the overestimated
cluster plasma temperatures they employ lead to gross underestimates of the K XVIII line emissivity.
