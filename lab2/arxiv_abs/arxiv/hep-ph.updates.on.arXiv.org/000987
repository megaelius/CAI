The Machine Learning (ML) techniques rapidly find place among methods of High Energy Physics data
analysis. We continue discussion of previous publications on the CP-parity state of the Higgs boson
measurement wit the H to tau tau decay channel. As before ML techniques are used for the multi-dimensional
space of variables/features from the consecutive tau_pm to rho_pm nu; rho_pm to pi_pm pi_0 and tau_pm
to a_1_pm nu; a_1_pm to rho_0 pi_pm to 3 pi_pm cascade decays. Discrimination of Higgs boson CP-parity
state was studied as binary classification. Information on the hadronic tau leptons decay products
was used. Now, we investigate possible improvements on ML classification from the constraints
on non measurable directly outgoing neutrinos. We find, that once added to the ML classification
features enhance the sensitivity sizably, even if only imperfect approximations can be achieved.
In principle, all information is provided with 4-momenta of the final state particles present in
the events and decay vertex positions (or decay impact parameters). Similar as in the past, not all
such information was efficiently identified and used in ML training. We investigate how optimized
high-level features, like some angles of neutrino orientation, improve ML performance. This can
be understood as an intermediate step. Better classifiers where expert variables will not be necessary
may be identified or developed. For the performance comparison, in parallel to Deep Learning Neural
Network, we use other ML methods: Boosted Trees, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. Finally,
we mention alternative methods of observable constructions where reconstruction of spin sensitive
tau lepton polarimetric vectors is performed.
