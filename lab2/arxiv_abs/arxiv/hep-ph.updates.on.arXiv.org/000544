If dark matter is composed of new particles, these may be gravitationally bound to the Sun after scattering
on solar nuclei, thermalize after further interactions, and finally annihilate into Standard
Model particles, generating neutrinos which we can detect on Earth. Typically, one assumes that
equilibration between capture and annihilations has been reached, so that the annihilation rate
is completely determined by the capture rate. For elastic interactions, this is usually an excellent
approximation, while it may not be so for dark matter scattering inelastically into a slightly heavier
($\mathcal{O} (10-100)$ keV) state. One issue is that the kinetic energy of the captured dark matter,
after having scattered a number of times, might not be sufficient to allow up-scattering, at which
point the thermalization process effectively stops. Moreover, down-scatterings from the excited
state may cause a large evaporation rate. In this work we perform a numerical simulation of the whole
process in order to check: if the distribution reaches a stationary state in a solar lifetime; if
thermalization with solar nuclei occurs, i.e., if the final distribution is isothermal (Maxwell-Boltzmann);
in case the distribution is not isothermal, whether the annihilation rate into neutrinos is sizeable,
and the conditions under which equilibrium between annihilation and capture is reached are satisfied;
and finally, whether evaporation plays an important role. We find that, unless the mass splitting
is very small ($\lesssim 50$ keV) and/or the dark matter has a sub-dominant elastic cross section,
the dark matter distribution does not reach a stationary state, it is not isothermal at the solar
temperature, annihilations are suppressed and equilibration is not reached. We also find that
evaporation induced by down-scattering is not effective in reducing the total dark matter abundance.
