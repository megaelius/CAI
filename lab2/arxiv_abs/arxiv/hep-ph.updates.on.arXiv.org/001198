To maximise the potential for new measurements and discoveries at the LHC, the machine delivers
as high as possible collision rates. As a consequence, multiple proton-proton collisions occur
whenever two bunches cross. Interesting high-energy (hard) collisions are therefore contaminated
by several soft, zero-bias, ones. This effect known as pileup pollutes the final state of the collision.
It complicates the reconstruction of the objects in this final state, resulting in increased experimental
uncertainties. To reduce these uncertainties, and improve the quality and precision of LHC measurements,
techniques are devised to correct for the effects of pileup. This document provides a theoretical
review of the main methods used during Run I and II of the LHC to mitigate pileup effects. I start with
an in-depth presentation of the area--median used for the majority of applications, including
several refinements of the original idea, their practical implementation and an assessment of
their efficiency and robustness. I then focus on several theoretical calculations that can provide
both quantitative and qualitative information on the area--median approach. In the case of boosted
jets, a field that has seen a wide interest recently, a set of methods, known as grooming techniques
has also been used. I describe these techniques, address their performance and briefly show that
they are amenable to a theoretical, analytic, understanding. The last part of this review focuses
on ideas oriented towards future pileup mitigation techniques. This includes new methods that
have recently been proposed as well as a large series of alternative ideas. The latter are yet unpublished
and have not received the same amount of investigation than the former but they have the potential
to bring new developments and further improvement over existing techniques in a future where pileup
mitigation will be crucial.
