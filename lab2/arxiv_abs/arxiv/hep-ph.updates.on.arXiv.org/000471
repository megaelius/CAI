Studying the smallest self-bound dark matter structure in our Universe can yield important clues
about the fundamental particle nature of dark matter. Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing
provides a unique way to detect and characterize dark matter substructures at cosmological distances
from the Milky Way. Within the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, the number of low-mass subhalos within
lens galaxies is expected to be large, implying that their contribution to the lensing convergence
field is approximately Gaussian and could thus be described by their power spectrum. We develop
here a general formalism to compute from first principles the substructure convergence power spectrum
for different populations of dark matter subhalos. As an example, we apply our framework to two distinct
subhalo populations: a truncated Navarro-Frenk-White subhalo population motivated by standard
CDM, and a truncated cored subhalo population motivated by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM).
We study in detail how the subhalo abundance, mass function, internal density profile, and concentration
affect the amplitude and shape of the substructure power spectrum. We determine that the power spectrum
is mostly sensitive to a specific combination of the subhalo abundance and moments of the mass function,
as well as to the average tidal truncation scale of the largest subhalos included in the analysis.
Interestingly, we show that the asymptotic slope of the substructure power spectrum at large wave
number reflects the internal density profile of the subhalos. In particular, the SIDM power spectrum
exhibits a characteristic steepening at large wave number absent in the CDM power spectrum, opening
the possibility of using this observable, if at all measurable, to discern between these two scenarios.
