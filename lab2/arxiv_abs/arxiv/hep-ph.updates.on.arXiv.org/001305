We compute the mass, radius and tidal deformability of stars containing phase transitions from
hadronic to quark phase(s). These quantities are computed for three types of hadronic envelopes:
purely nuclear, hyperonic, and $\Delta$-resonance--hyperon admixed matter. We consider either
a single first-order phase transition to a quark phase with a maximally stiff equation of state (EoS)
or two sequential first-order phase transitions mimicking a transition from hadronic to a quark
matter phase followed by a second phase transition to another quark phase. We explore the parameter
space which produces low mass twin and triplet configurations where equal mass stars have substantially
different radii and tidal deformabilities. We demonstrate that while for purely hadronic stiff
EoS the obtained maximum mass is inconsistent with the upper limit on this quantity placed by GW170817,
the inclusion of the hyperonic and $\Delta$-resonance degrees of freedom, as well as the deconfinement
phase transition at sufficiently low density, produce configuration of stars consistent with
this limit. The obtained hybrid star configurations are in the mass range relevant for the interpretation
of the GW170817 event. We compare our results for the tidal deformability with the limits inferred
from GW170817 showing that the onset of non-nucleonic phases, such as $\Delta$-resonance--hyperon
admixed phase or/and the quark phase(s) is favored by this data if the nuclear EoS is stiff. Also,
we show that low-mass twins and especially triplets proliferate the number of combinations of possible
types of star that can undergo a merger event, the maximal number being six in the case of triplets.
The prospects for uncovering the first-order phase transition(s) to and in quark matter via measurements
of tidal deformabilities in merger events are discussed.
