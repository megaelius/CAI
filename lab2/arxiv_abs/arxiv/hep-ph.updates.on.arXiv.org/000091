Predictions obtained with a confining, symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector-vector contact
interaction at leading-order in a widely used truncation of QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations are
presented for \Delta and \Omega baryon elastic form factors and the \gamma N -> \Delta transition
form factors. This simple framework produces results that are practically indistinguishable
from the best otherwise available, an outcome which highlights that the key to describing many features
of baryons and unifying them with the properties of mesons is a veracious expression of dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking in the hadron bound-state problem. The following specific results are
of particular interest. The \Delta elastic form factors are very sensitive to m_\Delta. Hence,
given that the parameters which define extant simulations of lattice-regularised QCD produce
\Delta-resonance masses that are very large, the form factors obtained therewith are a poor guide
to properties of the \Delta(1232). Considering the \Delta-baryon's quadrupole moment, whilst
all computations produce a negative value, the conflict between theoretical predictions entails
that it is currently impossible to reach a sound conclusion on the nature of the \Delta-baryon's
deformation in the infinite momentum frame. Results for analogous properties of the \Omega baryon
are less contentious. In connection with the N->\Delta transition, the Ash-convention magnetic
transition form factor falls faster than the neutron's magnetic form factor and nonzero values
for the associated quadrupole ratios reveal the impact of quark orbital angular momentum within
the nucleon and \Delta; and, furthermore, these quadrupole ratios do slowly approach their anticipated
asymptotic limits.
