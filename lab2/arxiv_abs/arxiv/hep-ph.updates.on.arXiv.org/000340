We analyze the flavor structure of composite vector bosons arising in a model of vectorlike technicolor,
often called hypercolor (HC), with eight flavors that form a one-family content of HC fermions.
Dynamics of the composite vector bosons, referred to as HC rho in this paper, are formulated together
with HC pions by the hidden local symmetry (HLS), in a way analogous to QCD vector mesons. Then coupling
properties to the standard model (SM) fermions, which respect the HLS gauge symmetry, are described
in a way that couplings of the HC rhos to the left-handed SM quarks and leptons are given by a well-defined
setup as taking the flavor mixing structures into account. Under the present scenario, we discuss
significant bounds on the model from electroweak precision tests, flavor physics, and collider
physics. We also try to address B anomalies in processes such as B -> K(*) mu+ mu- and B -> D(*) tau nu,
recently reported by LHCb, Belle, (ATLAS, and CMS in part.) Then we find that the present model can
account for the anomaly in B -> K(*) mu+ mu- consistently with the other constraints while it predicts
no significant deviations in B -> D(*) tau nu from the SM, which can be examined in the future Belle
II experiment. The former is archived with the form C9 = -C10 of the Wilson coefficients for effective
operators of b -> s mu+ mu-, which has been favored by the recent experimental data. We also investigate
current and future experimental limits at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and see that possible
collider signals come from dijet and ditau, or dimuon resonant searches for the present scenario
with TeV mass range. To conclude, the present b -> s mu+ mu- anomaly is likely to imply discovery of
new vector bosons in the ditau or dimuon channel in the context of the HC rho model. Our model can be
considered as a UV completion of conventional U(1)' model.
