We consider the freeze-in production of 7 keV axino dark matter (DM) in the supersymmetric Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky
(DFSZ) model in light of the 3.5 keV line excess. The warmness of such 7 keV DM produced from the thermal
bath, in general, appears in tension with Ly-$\alpha$ forest data, although a direct comparison
is not straightforward. This is because the Ly-$\alpha$ forest constraints are usually reported
on the mass of the conventional warm dark matter (WDM), where large entropy production is implicitly
assumed to occur in the thermal bath after WDM particles decouple. The phase space distribution
of freeze-in axino DM varies depending on production processes and axino DM may alleviate the tension
with the tight Ly-$\alpha$ forest constraint. By solving the Boltzmann equation, we first obtain
the resultant phase space distribution of axinos produced by 2-body decay, 3-body decay, and 2-to-2
scattering respectively. The reduced collision term and resultant phase space distribution are
useful for studying other freeze-in scenarios as well. We then calculate the resultant linear matter
power spectra for such axino DM and directly compare them with the linear matter power spectra for
the conventional WDM. In order to demonstrate realistic axino DM production, we consider benchmark
points with Higgsino next-to-light supersymmetric particle (NLSP) and wino NLSP. In the case of
Higgsino NLSP, the phase space distribution of axinos is colder than that in the conventional WDM
case, so the most stringent Ly-$\alpha$ forest constraint can be evaded with mild entropy production
from saxion decay inherent in the supersymmetric DFSZ axion model.
