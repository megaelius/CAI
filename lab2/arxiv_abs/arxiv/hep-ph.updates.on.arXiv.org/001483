We propose an algorithm for the application of the Laplace method for the calculation of the simplest
Feynman diagram with a single loop in the scalar {\phi}^3 theory. The calculation of the contribution
of such a diagram to the scattering amplitude requires the calculation of a fourfold integral over
the four-momenta components circulating in a loop. The essence of the Laplace method for the calculation
of multiple integrals lies in the fact that if the module of an integrand has a point of sufficiently
sharp maximum inside the integration domain, then the integral can be replaced by a Gaussian integral
by representing the integrand in the form of an exponent from the logarithm and expanding this logarithm
into Taylor series in the vicinity of a maximum point up to the second degree terms. We show that there
are two-dimensional and non-intersecting surfaces inside the four-dimensional region of integration,
on which the maximum of the module of integrand is reached. This leads to a problem that the integrand
is non-analytically dependent on the parameters responsible for bypassing the poles. Also the
derivatives of logarithm of the scattering amplitude are non-analytically dependent on these
parameters. However, in the paper we show that these non-analyticities compensate each other.
As a result of such a procedure, three of the four integrations can be done analytically, and the calculation
of the contribution of the diagram to the scattering amplitude is reduced to a numerical calculation
of the single integral in finite bounds from an expression that does not contain non-analyticities.
The described calculation method is used to construct a model dependence of elastic scattering
differential cross section d{\sigma}_elastic/dt on the square of the transmitted four-momentum
t (Mandelstam variable).
