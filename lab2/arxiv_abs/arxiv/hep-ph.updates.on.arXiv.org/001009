We calculate total and differential cross sections for $J/\psi$ photoproduction in ultrarelativistic
lead-lead collisions at the LHC energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We use a simple model based on
vector dominance picture and multiple scattering of the hadronic ($c \bar c$) state in a cold nucleus.
In our analysis we use Glauber formulae for calculating $\sigma_{tot,J/\psi Pb}$ which is a building
block of our model. For semi-central collisions a modification of the photon flux is necessary.
We discuss how to effectively correct photon fluxes for geometry effects. We try to estimate the
cross sections for different centrality bins and for $J/\psi$ mesons emitted in forward rapidity
range ($2.5<y<4$) corresponding to the ALICE experimental results. We discuss similar analysis
for dilepton production in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at very low pair transverse
momenta, $P_T\leq 0.15$\,GeV. We investigate the interplay of thermal radiation with photon annihilation
processes, $\gamma \gamma \to l^+ l^-$, due to the coherent electromagnetic fields of the colliding
nuclei. For the thermal radiation, we employ the emission from the QGP and hadronic phases with in-medium
vector spectral functions. We first verify that the combination of photon fusion, thermal radiation
and final-state hadron decays gives a fair description of the low-$P_T$ invariant-mass as well
as $P_T$ distributions as measured recently by the STAR collaboration in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200\,GeV
Au+Au collisions for different centralities. The coherent contribution dominates in peripheral
collisions, while thermal radiation shows a significantly stronger increase with centrality.
We also provide predictions for the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The resulting excitation function
reveals a nontrivial interplay of photoproduction and thermal radiation.
