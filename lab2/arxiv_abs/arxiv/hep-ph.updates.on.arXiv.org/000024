We perform an extensive study of flavor observables in a 2HDM with generic Yukawa structure (the
decoupling limit of the MSSM). We examine the effects in flavor physics and constrain the model both
from tree-level processes and loop-observables. The free parameters of the model are the heavy
Higgs mass, tan(\beta) and the "non-holomorphic" Yukawa couplings \epsilon^f_ij (f=u,d,\ell).
In our analysis we constrain the elements \epsilon^f_ij in various ways: In a first step we give order
of magnitude constraints on \epsilon^f_ij from 't Hooft's naturalness criterion. Then we constrain
the Yukawa structure of the type-III 2HDM from tree-level FCNC processes (B_s,d->\mu^+\mu^-,
\tau^-->\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-, etc.) and observe that all flavor off-diagonal elements except
\epsilon^u_32,31 and \epsilon^u_23,13 must be very small in order to satisfy the experimental
bounds. In a third step, we consider Higgs mediated loop contributions to FCNC processes (b->s,d\gamma,
\mu->e\gamma, etc.) finding that also \epsilon^u_13 and \epsilon^u_23 must be very small,
while the bounds on \epsilon^u_31 and \epsilon^u_32 are especially weak. Taking into account the
constraints from FCNC processes we study the possible size of contributions from tree-level charged
Higgs exchange. Interestingly, the unconstrained elements \epsilon^u_{32,31} enter directly
the branching ratios for B->\tau\nu, B->D\tau\nu and B->D*\tau\nu and we show that the
deviations from the SM predictions in these processes can be explained simultaneously. We give
upper limits on the branching ratios of the lepton flavor-violating neutral B meson decays and correlate
the radiative lepton decays to the corresponding neutral current lepton decays (\tau^- ->\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-,
\tau^- ->e^-\mu^+\mu^- and \mu^- ->e^-e^+e^-). A detailed appendix contains all relevant
information for the considered processes for general scalar-fermion-fermion couplings.
