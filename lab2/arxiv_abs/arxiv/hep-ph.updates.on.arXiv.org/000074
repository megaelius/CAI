Warm Dark Matter(WDM), considerably clarifies and simplifies galaxies and galaxy formation in
agreement with observations. WDM essentially works, naturally reproducing the astronomical
observations over all scales, small (galactic) as well as large and cosmological scales.Evidence
that CDM, CDM+baryons and proposed tailored cures do not work in galaxies is staggering, The Chalonge
Meudon Workshop 2012 approached DM in a fourfold coherent way: astronomical observations (galaxy
and cluster properties, haloes, rotation curves, density profiles, surface density), LambdaWDM
N-body simulations, WDM theory (Boltzmann-Vlasov evolution, halo mass functions, halo models,
improved perturbative approachs), quantum WDM fermions forming the observed cores, WDM particle
and nuclear physics (sterile neutrinos) and its experimental search. N Amorisco, P Biermann, S
Das, H J de Vega, A Kamada, E Ferri(MARE),I D Karanchetsev, W Liao, M Lovell, M Papastergis, N G Sanchez,
P Valageas,C Watson, J Zavala,He Zhang present their Highlights.Inside galaxy cores, N-body classical
physics simulations are incorrect for WDM because of important quantum effects at such scales.Quantum
WDM calculations (Thomas-Fermi) provide galaxy cores, galaxy masses, velocity dispersions and
density profiles in agreement with observations.Baryons (16% of DM) are expected to give a correction
to pure WDM results. The summary and conclusions by H. J. de Vega and N. G. Sanchez stress that all evidences
point to a DM particle mass around 2 keV. Peter Biermann in his live minutes concludes that a few keV
sterile neutrino is the most serious DM candidate. MARE -and hopefully KATRIN- could provide a sterile
neutrino signal.There is a formidable WDM work to perform ahead of us, these highlights point research
directions worthwhile to pursue.Photos of the Workshop are included (Abridged).
