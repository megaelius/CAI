The gauge boson sector in the renormalizable 3-3-1 model for the SM fermion mass and mixing is explored.
The data of rho parameter shows that a VEV of the first spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) ranges
from 3.6 TeV to 6.1 TeV. Therefore the mass of new heavy neutral gauge boson Z' ranges from 1.42 TeV
to 2.42 TeV, which is consistent with estimation from other 3-3-1 models. In that region of masses,
we find that the total cross section for the production of the heavy neutral gauge boson Z' at the LHC
via Drell-Yan mechanism ranges from 46.2 pb up to 2.89 pb. On the other hand, in a future 100 TeV proton-proton
collider the total cross section for the Drell-Yan production of a heavy Z'neutral gauge boson gets
significantly enhanced reaching values ranging from 1371 pb up to 235 pb. By the way, masses of new
bilepton gauge bosons Y and X are around 800 GeV which are quite good. The Higgs sector of the model
is explored. The Higgs potential with lepton number conserving was in details considered. The SM
Higgs boson was derived and as expected, is most contained from \eta_1^0. For the total potential
including lepton number violating, except CP-even sector, situation is similar. The potential
consists of enough number of Goldstone bosons for massive gauge bosons. The potential contains
a complex scalar candidate for Dark Matter $\va_2^0$ and a Mojoron but it is harmless since being
a singlet. The constraints arising from the estimation of the Dark Matter (DM) relic density, set
the mass of the scalar dark matter candidate in the range 300 GeV\ \lesssim m_{\va } \lesssim 600 GeV,
for a quartic scalar coupling $\la _{h^{2}\va ^{2}}$ in the window $0.5\lesssim \la _{h^{2}\va
^{2}}\lesssim 1$.
