We investigate the possible scenario of deconfinement of hyperon rich hadronic matter to quark
matter at high densities and the resulting hybrid star (HS) properties are analyzed. In the relativistic
mean-field framework, we construct the equation of state (EoS) of hadronic matter using the effective
chiral model while the pure quark matter is described using the MIT Bag model. We revisit the hyperon
puzzle and analyze the possibility of hadron-quark phase transition with proper choice of the bag
constant. In static condition the maximum mass of the resultant HSs are in good agreement with the
recent observational bounds on the same from high mass pulsars such as PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432.
On invoking the phenomenon of phase transition, the radius of canonical mass ($R_{1.4}$) and value
of $R_{1.6}$ predicted by the model lie within the range prescribed from binary neutron star (BNS)
merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration in 2017. The surface redshift obtained for the
HSs also satisfy the constraints from pulsars RX J0720.4-3125 and 1E 1207.4-5209. It is noteworthy
that unlike several other works, we add no modifications to the original form of the Bag model to satisfy
these recent observational and empirical constraints on NS properties. We also discuss the rotational
aspects of the HSs by calculating the properties like rotational mass, radius, energy density,
moment of inertia at different angular velocities. The maximum bound on rotational frequency from
the rapidly rotating pulsars like PSR B1937+21 and PSR J1748-2446ad are satisfied with the HS configuration.
We also test the universality of our hybrid EoS in terms of normalized moment of inertia.
