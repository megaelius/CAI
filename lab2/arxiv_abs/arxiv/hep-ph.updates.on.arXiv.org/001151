Searches for supersymmetric electroweakinos have entered a crucial phase, as the integrated luminosity
of the Large Hadron Collider is now high enough to compensate for their weak production cross-sections.
Working in a framework where the neutralinos and charginos are the only light sparticles in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model, we use gambit to perform a detailed likelihood analysis of the electroweakino
sector. We focus on the impacts of recent ATLAS and CMS searches with 36 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton
collision data. We also include constraints from LEP and invisible decays of the $Z$ and Higgs bosons.
Under the background-only hypothesis, we show that current LHC searches do not robustly exclude
any range of neutralino or chargino masses. However, a pattern of excesses in several LHC analyses
points towards a possible signal, with neutralino masses of $(m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0},
m_{\tilde{\chi}_3^0}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_4^0})$ = (8-155, 103-260, 130-473, 219-502) GeV and
chargino masses of $(m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^{\pm}}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^{\pm}})$ = (104-259, 224-507)
GeV at the 95% confidence level. The lightest neutralino is mostly bino, with a possible modest Higgsino
or wino component. We find that this excess has a combined local significance of $3.3\sigma$, subject
to a number of cautions. If one includes LHC searches for charginos and neutralinos conducted with
8 TeV proton-proton collision data, the local significance is lowered to 2.9$\sigma$. We briefly
consider the implications for dark matter, finding that the correct relic density can be obtained
through the Higgs-funnel and $Z$-funnel mechanisms, even assuming that all other sparticles are
decoupled. All samples, gambit input files and best-fit models from this study are available on
Zenodo.
