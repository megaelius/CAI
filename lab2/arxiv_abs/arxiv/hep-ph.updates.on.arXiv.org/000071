The nature of the Isotropic $\gamma$-ray Background (IGRB) measured by the Large Area Telescope
(LAT) on the Fermi $\gamma$-ray space Telescope ({\it Fermi}) remains partially unexplained.
Non-negligible contributions may originate from extragalactic populations of unresolved sources
such as blazars, star-forming galaxies or galactic milli-second pulsars. A recent prediction
of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with a large viewing angle
with respect to the line-of-sight (l.o.s.) has demonstrated that this faint but numerous population
is also expected to contribute significantly to the total IGRB intensity. A more exotic contribution
to the IGRB invokes the pair annihilation of dark matter (DM) weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs) into $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we evaluate the room left for galactic DM at high latitudes
($>10^\circ$) by including photons from both prompt emission and inverse Compton scattering,
emphasizing the impact of the newly discovered contribution from misaligned AGN (MAGN) for such
an analysis. Summing up all significant galactic and extragalactic components of the IGRB, we find
that an improved understanding of the associated astrophysical uncertainties is still mandatory
to put stringent bounds on thermally produced DM. On the other hand, we also demonstrate that the
IGRB has the potential to be one of the most competitive {\it future} ways to test the DM WIMP hypothesis,
once the present uncertainties are even slightly reduced. In fact, if MAGN contribute even at 90%
of the maximal level consistent with our current understanding, thermally produced WIMPs would
be severely constrained as DM candidates for masses up to several TeV.
