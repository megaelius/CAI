Heavy fermion pair production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation is a fundamental process in hadron physics
and is of considerable interest for various phenomena. In this paper, we will apply the Principle
of Maximum Conformality (PMC) to provide a comprehensive analysis of these processes. The PMC provides
a systematic, unambiguous method for determining the renormalization scales of the QCD coupling
constant for single-scale and multiple-scale applications. The resulting predictions eliminate
any renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities, eliminate the factorial renormalon divergences,
and are consistent with the requirements of the renormalization group. It is remarkable that two
distinctly different scales are determined by using the PMC for heavy fermion pair production near
the threshold region. One scale is the order of the fermion mass $m_f$, which enters the hard virtual
corrections, and the other scale is of order $ v\,m_f$, where $v$ is the quark velocity, which enters
the Coulomb rescattering amplitude. The conventional procedure of simply setting the renormalization
scales as $\mu_r=m_f$ violates the physical behavior of the subprocesses and leads to unreliable
predictions for fermion pair production in the threshold region. In contrast, the PMC scales yield
the correct physical behavior and reflect the virtuality of the propagating gluons (photons) for
the QCD (QED) processes. Moreover, we demonstrate the consistency of PMC scale setting from QCD
to QED. Perfect agreement between the Abelian unambiguous Gell-Mann-Low and the PMC scale-setting
methods in the limit of zero number of colors is demonstrated.
