The contributions of a second Higgs doublet to the electron electric dipole moment near the heavy
Higgs decoupling limit are determined within an effective field theory framework. In models that
satisfy the Glashow-Weinberg condition, the leading contributions in this limit at effective
dimension six are shown to come from two-loop Barr-Zee diagrams that include the Standard Model-like
Higgs boson. Additional diagrams that include heavy Higgs bosons are sub-leading and contribute
only at effective dimension eight near the decoupling limit. This simplification implies that
to leading order in this limit, contributions of a second Higgs doublet to the electron electric
dipole moment can be couched entirely in terms of the ratio of Higgs doublet expectation values and
a single universal phase appearing in the effective couplings of the Standard Model-like Higgs
boson to fermions, without direct reference to the heavy Higgs boson masses or couplings. The recent
bound from the ACME II experiment constrains the phases of the couplings of the Standard Model-like
Higgs boson to up-type quarks and leptons at the part per mil level in Type I and IV two Higgs doublet
models. In Type II and III models these phases are constrained at the two parts per mil or better level
except in a tiny sliver of parameter space with nearly equal Higgs doublet expectation values where
destructive interference among contributing diagrams happens to occur. In a more general phenomenological
parameterization with individual effective phases in the couplings of the Standard Model-like
Higgs boson to third generation fermions and the electron, the top quark and electron coupling phases
are constrained at the part per mil level except in tiny slivers of parameter space, while the bottom
quark and tau-lepton coupling phases are constrained only at the thirty percent level.
