Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type models are often employed as low-energy models for the theory of the strong
interaction to analyze its phase structure at finite temperature and quark chemical potential.
In particular at low temperature and large chemical potential, where the application of fully first-principles
approaches is currently difficult at best, this class of models still plays a prominent role to guide
our understanding of the dynamics of dense strong-interaction matter. In this work, we consider
a Fierz-complete version of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with two massless quark flavors and study
its renormalization group flow and fixed-point structure at leading order of the derivative expansion
of the effective action. Sum rules for the various four-quark couplings then allow us to monitor
the strength of the breaking of the axial $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry close to and above the phase boundary.
We find that the dynamics in the ten-dimensional Fierz-complete space of four-quark couplings
can only be reduced to a one-dimensional space associated with the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling
in the strict large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit. Still, the interacting fixed point associated with this
one-dimensional subspace appears to govern the dynamics at small quark chemical potential even
beyond the large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit. At large chemical potential, corrections beyond the large-$N_{\rm
c}$ limit become important and the dynamics is dominated by diquarks, favoring the formation of
a chirally symmetric diquark condensate. In this regime, our study suggests that the phase boundary
is shifted to higher temperatures when a Fierz-complete set of four-quark interactions is considered.
