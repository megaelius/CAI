We present a detailed investigation of a sub-dominant oscillating scalar field ('early dark energy',
EDE) in the context of resolving the Hubble tension. Consistent with earlier work, but without relying
on fluid approximations, we find that a scalar field frozen due to Hubble friction until ${\rm log}_{10}(z_c)\sim3.5$,
reaching $\rho_{\rm EDE}(z_c)/\rho_{\rm tot}\sim10$%, and diluting faster than matter afterwards
can bring cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryonic acoustic oscillations, supernovae luminosity
distances, and the late-time estimate of the Hubble constant from the SH0ES collaboration into
agreement. A scalar field potential which scales as $V(\phi) \propto \phi^{2n}$ with $2\lesssim
n\lesssim 3.4$ around the minimum is preferred at the 68% confidence level, and the {\em Planck}
polarization places additional constraints on the dynamics of perturbations in the scalar field.
In particular, the data prefers a potential which flattens at large field displacements. An MCMC
analysis of mock data shows that the next-generation CMB observations (i.e., CMB-S4) can unambiguously
detect the presence of the EDE at very high significance. This projected sensitivity to the EDE dynamics
is mainly driven by improved measurements of the $E$-mode polarization. We also explore new observational
signatures of EDE scalar field dynamics: (i) We find that depending on the strength of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, the presence of the EDE might imply the existence of isocurvature perturbations in the CMB.
(ii) We show that a strikingly rapid, scale-dependent growth of EDE field perturbations can result
from parametric resonance driven by the anharmonic oscillating field for $n\approx 2$. This instability
and ensuing potentially nonlinear, spatially inhomogenoues, dynamics may provide unique signatures
of this scenario.
