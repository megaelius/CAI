We consider three-flavor chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) at zero temperature and nonzero
isospin ($\mu_{I}$) and strange ($\mu_{S}$) chemical potentials. The effective potential is
calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the $\pi^{\pm}$-condensed phase, the $K^{\pm}$-condensed
phase, and the $K^0/\bar{K}^0$-condensed phase. It is shown that the transition from the vacuum
phase to these phases are second order and takes place when, $|\mu_I|=m_{\pi}$, $|{1\over2}\mu_I+\mu_S|=m_K$,
and $|-{1\over2}\mu_I+\mu_S|=m_K$, respectively at tree level and remains unchanged at NLO.
The transition between the two condensed phases is first order. The effective potential in the pion-condensed
phase is independent of $\mu_K$ and in the kaon-condensed phases, it only depends on the combinations
$\pm{1\over2}\mu_I+\mu_K$ and not separately on $\mu_I$ and $\mu_K$. We calculate the pressure,
isospin density and the equation of state in the pion-condensed phase and compare our results with
recent $(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD data. We find that three-flavor $\chi$PT is in excellent agreement
with lattice QCD near the second order phase transition at $\mu_{I}=m_{\pi}$ when using the central
values of the low energy constants (LECs), which includes the vacuum pion (and kaon) masses, pion
(and kaon) decay constants and the LECs ($L_{i}$) of the $\mathcal{O}(p^{4})$ $\chi$PT Lagrangian.
For larger values of the isospin chemical potential (and zero strange quark chemical potential),
while $\chi$PT and lattice QCD results are consistent for the observables including pressure,
isospin density and energy density, the central values of LECs produce observables that are overestimates
compared to the lattice results.
