The evidence of environmental dependence of Type Ia supernova luminosity has inspired recent discussion
about whether the late-universe cosmic acceleration is still supported by supernova data. We adopt
the $\Delta\mathrm{HR}/\Delta\mathrm{age}$ parameter, which describes the dependence of supernova
absolute magnitude on the age of supernova progenitor, as an additional nuisance parameter. Using
the Pantheon supernova data, a lower bound $\ge 12\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ on the cosmic age, and a Gaussian
prior $H_0 = 70\pm 2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ on the Hubble constant, we reconstruct the
cosmic acceleration history. Within the flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework,
we still find a $5.6\sigma$ detection of cosmic acceleration. This is because a matter dominated
decelerating universe would be too young to accommodate observed old stars with age $\gtrsim 12\,\mathrm{Gyr}$.
A decelerating but non-flat universe is marginally consistent with the data, however, only in the
presence of a negative spatial curvature $\sim$ two orders of magnitude beyond the current constraint
from cosmic microwave background data. Finally, we propose a more general Parameterization based
on the cosmic Age (PAge), which is {\it not} directly tied to the dark energy concept and hence is ideal
for a null test of the cosmic acceleration. We find that, for a magnitude evolution rate $\Delta\mathrm{HR}/\Delta\mathrm{age}
\lesssim 0.3\,\mathrm{mag}/5.3\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ (Kang et al 2019), a spatially flat and decelerating
PAge universe is fully consistent with the supernova data and the cosmic age bound, and has no tension
with the geometric constraint from the observed CMB acoustic angular scales.
