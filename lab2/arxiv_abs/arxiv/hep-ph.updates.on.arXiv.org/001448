The Galactic Center GeV excess (GCE) has garnered great interest as a possible signal of either dark
matter annihilation or some novel astrophysical phenomenon, such as a new population of gamma-ray
emitting pulsars. In a companion paper, we showed that in a $10^\circ$ radius region of interest
(ROI) surrounding the Galactic Center, apparent evidence for GCE point sources (PSs) from non-Poissonian
template fitting (NPTF) is actually an artifact of unmodeled north-south asymmetry of the GCE.
In this work, we develop a simplified analytic description of how signal mismodeling can drive an
apparent preference for a PS population, and demonstrate how the behavior pointed out in the companion
paper also appears in simpler simulated datasets that contain no PS signals at all. We explore the
generality of this behavior in the real gamma-ray data, and discuss the implications for past and
future studies using NPTF techniques. While the drop in PS preference once north-south asymmetry
is included is not ubiquitous in larger ROIs, we show that any overly-rigid signal model is expected
to yield a spurious PS signal that can appear very convincing: as well as apparent significance comparable
to what one would expect from a true PS population, the signal can exhibit stability against a range
of variations in the analysis, and a source count function that is very consistent with previous
apparent NPTF-based detections of a GCE PS population. This contrasts with previously-studied
forms of systematic mismodeling which are unlikely to mimic a PS population in the same way. In the
light of this observation, and its explicit realization in the region where the GCE is brightest,
we argue that a dominantly smooth origin for the GCE is not in tension with existing NPTF analyses.
