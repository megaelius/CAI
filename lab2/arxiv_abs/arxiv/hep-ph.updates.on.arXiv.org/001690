The proposed electron-proton collider LHeC is a unique facility where electroweak interactions
can be studied with a very high precision in a largely unexplored kinematic regime of spacelike momentum
transfer. We have simulated inclusive neutral- and charged-current deep-inelastic lepton proton
scattering cross section data at center-of-mass energies of 1.2 and 1.3 TeV including their systematic
uncertainties. Based on simultaneous fits of electroweak physics parameters and parton distribution
functions, we estimate the uncertainties of Standard Model parameters as well as a number of parameters
describing physics beyond the Standard Model, for instance the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, and
$U$. An unprecedented precision at the sub-percent level is expected for the measurement of the
weak neutral-current couplings of the light-quarks to the $Z$ boson, $g_{A/V}^{u/d}$, improving
their present precision by more than an order of magnitude. The weak mixing angle can be determined
with a precision of about $\Delta \sin^2\theta_\textrm{W} = \pm 0.00015$, and its scale dependence
can be studied in the range between about 25 and 700 GeV. An indirect determination of the $W$-boson
mass in the on-shell scheme is possible with an experimental uncertainty down to $\Delta m_{W}=\pm6\,\textrm{MeV}$.
We discuss how the uncertainties of such measurements in deep-inelastic scattering compare with
those from measurements in the timelike domain, e.g. at the $Z$-pole, and which aspects of the electroweak
interaction are unique to measurements at the LHeC, for instance electroweak parameters in charged-current
interactions. We conclude that the LHeC will determine electroweak physics parameters, in the
spacelike region, with unprecedented precision leading to thorough tests of the Standard Model
and possibly beyond.
