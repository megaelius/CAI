We investigate emission of bremsstrahlung photons during scattering of $\alpha$-particles off
nuclei. For that, we construct bremsstrahlung model for $\alpha$-nucleus scattering, where a
new formalism for coherent and incoherent bremsstrahlung emissions in elastic scattering and
mechanisms in inelastic scattering is added. Basing of this approach, we analyze experimental
bremsstrahlung cross-sections in the scattering of $\alpha$-particles off the \isotope[59]{Co},
\isotope[116]{Sn}, \isotope[\rm nat]{Ag} and \isotope[197]{Au} nuclei at 50 MeV of $\alpha$-particles
beam measured at the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Calcutta. We observe oscillations in the
calculated spectra for elastic scattering for each nucleus. But, for \isotope[59]{Co}, \isotope[116]{Sn}
and \isotope[\rm nat]{Ag} we obtain good agreement between calculated coherent spectrum with
incoherent contribution for elastic scattering with experimental data in the full photon energy
region. For heavy nucleus \isotope[197]{Au} we find that (1) Oscillating behavior of the calculated
spectrum of coherent emission in elastic scattering is in disagreement with experimental data,
(2) Inclusion of incoherent emission improves description of the data, but summarized spectrum
is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. To understand unknown modification of
wave function for scattering, we add new mechanisms of inelastic scattering to calculations and
extract information about unknown new amplitude of such mechanisms from experimental data analysis.
This amplitude has maxima at some energies, that characterizes existence of states of the most compact
structures (clusters) in nucleus-target. We explain origin of oscillations in the bremsstrahlung
spectra for elastic scattering (at first time). New information about coherent and incoherent
contributions is extracted for studied reactions.
