One of the explanations proposed for the recent rare $B$-decay anomalies is the existence of a scalar
leptoquark. We investigate a grand unification scenario where a single, charge -1/3 scalar leptoquark
($S_1$) is present as the only new physics candidate at the TeV-scale. This leptoquark along with
the Standard Model (SM) Higgs doublet originates from the 10-dimensional real scalar multiplet
in $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ grand unification framework. An $S_1$ residing in the same representation
as the SM Higgs motivates the idea that its mass is close to the electroweak scale as the peculiar mass
splittings within this multiplet do not occur. Therefore, possible detection of a TeV-scale $S_1$
leptoquark, unaccompanied by any other new particles, could be interpreted in favour of $\mathrm{SO}(10)$
grand unification. We explicitly show how the gauge coupling unification is achieved with only
one intermediate symmetry breaking scale at which the Pati-Salam gauge group, obtained from the
$\mathrm{SO}(10)$ breaking at the unification scale, is broken into the SM group. We investigate
the phenomenological implications of our scenario and show that an $S_1$ with a specific Yukawa
texture can still be a viable candidate to explain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomalies. In order to obtain
the allowed parameter space of our scenario, we consider the relevant flavour data including $R_{D^{(*)}}$
and $R_K^{\nu\nu}$ measurements, $Z\to\tau\tau$ decay and the latest $\tau\tau$ resonance search
data at the LHC. We find that the LHC data strongly constrain the $S_1$ parameter space. We also find
that there exist parts of parameter space where a single $S_1$ can still explain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$
anomalies without being in conflict with any of these constraints.
