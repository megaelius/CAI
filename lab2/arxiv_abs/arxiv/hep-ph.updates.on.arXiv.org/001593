We study quadratic gravity $R^2+R_{[\mu\nu]}^2$ in the Palatini formalism where the connection
and the metric are independent. This action has a {\it gauged} scale symmetry (also known as Weyl
gauge symmetry) of Weyl gauge field $v_\mu= (\tilde\Gamma_\mu-\Gamma_\mu)/2$, with $\tilde\Gamma_\mu$
($\Gamma_\mu$) the trace of the Palatini (Levi-Civita) connection, respectively. The underlying
geometry is non-metric due to the $R_{[\mu\nu]}^2$ term acting as a gauge kinetic term for $v_\mu$.
We show that the gauge field becomes massive by a gravitational Stueckelberg mechanism by absorbing
the derivative of the dilaton ($\partial_\mu\ln\phi$). Palatini quadratic gravity with dynamical
$\tilde\Gamma_\mu\sim v_\mu$ is thus a gauged scale invariant theory broken spontaneously. In
the broken phase one finds the Einstein-Proca action of $v_\mu$ of mass near the Planck scale ($M$)
with a positive cosmological constant. Below this scale $v_\mu$ decouples, the connection becomes
Levi-Civita and metricity and Einstein gravity are recovered. The results remain valid in the presence
of non-minimally coupled matter, with Palatini connection. This is similar to recent results by
the author for Weyl quadratic gravity, up to different non-metricity effects. When coupled to a
Higgs-like scalar field, Palatini quadratic gravity gives successful inflation and a specific
prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $0.007\leq r \leq 0.01$ for current spectral index $n_s$
(at $95\%$CL) and N=60 efolds. This value of $r$ is mildly larger than in inflation in Weyl gravity,
due to different non-metricity. This establishes a connection between non-metricity and inflation
predictions and enables us to test these theories by future CMB experiments.
