We present a study of fits to exclusive $B^{0} \to D^{*-} \ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}$ measurements for
the determination of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element magnitude $|V_{cb}|$, based
on the most recent Belle untagged measurement. Results are obtained with the Caprini-Lellouch-Neubert
(CLN) and Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) form factor parameterisations, with and without the inclusion
of preliminary Lattice QCD measurements of form factors at non-zero hadronic recoil from the JLQCD
collaboration. The CLN and BGL fits are also studied in different scenarios with reduced theoretical
assumptions, and at higher order expansions respectively. To avoid bias from high systematic uncertainty
correlations we use a toy MC approach with a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. We
find that $\mathcal{F}(1)\eta_{\rm EW}|V_{cb}| = (35.2 \pm 0.2 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-3}$ for CLN
and $(34.9 \pm 0.3 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-3}$ for BGL(1,0,2) without input from Lattice QCD. The errors
quoted correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. We find no evidence
to support lepton flavour dependence on the measurement of $|V_{cb}|$ but find some tension in the
results associated with the ratio of form factors $R_1$. We show how input from JLQCD allows for well
defined fit results with reduced model dependence in CLN and BGL. The results obtained using preliminary
values are consistent between different orders of parameterisations, ultimately providing a
method for a model-independent exclusive measurement of $|V_{cb}|$. Using preliminary inputs
from the JLQCD collaboration, $\mathcal{F}(1)\eta_{\rm EW}|V_{cb}|$ is found to be approximately
$(35.1 \pm 0.07 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-3}$ in BGL(2,2,2).
