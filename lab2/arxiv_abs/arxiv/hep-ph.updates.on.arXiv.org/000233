We compute nucleon and Delta elastic and transition form factors, and compare predictions made
using a framework built upon a Faddeev equation kernel and interaction vertices that possess QCD-like
momentum dependence with results obtained using a vector-vector contact-interaction. The comparison
emphasises that experiment is sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running couplings and
masses in the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model and highlights that the key to describing
hadron properties is a veracious expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the bound-state
problem. Amongst the results we describe, the following are of particular interest: $G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$
possesses a zero at $Q^2=9.5GeV^2$; any change in the interaction which shifts a zero in the proton
ratio to larger $Q^2$ relocates a zero in $G_E^n(Q^2)/G_M^n(Q^2)$ to smaller $Q^2$; and there is
likely a value of momentum transfer above which $G_E^n>G_E^p$. Regarding the $\Delta(1232)$-baryon,
we find that, inter alia: the electric monopole form factor exhibits a zero; the electric quadrupole
form factor is negative, large in magnitude, and sensitive to the nature and strength of correlations
in the $\Delta(1232)$ Faddeev amplitude; and the magnetic octupole form factor is negative so long
as rest-frame P- and D-wave correlations are included. In connection with the N-to-Delta transition,
the momentum-dependence of the magnetic transition form factor, $G_M^\ast$, matches that of $G_M^n$
once the momentum transfer is high enough to pierce the meson-cloud; and the electric quadrupole
ratio is a keen measure of diquark and orbital angular momentum correlations.
