We present in this work a study of tree-dominated charmless three-body decays of $B$ mesons, $B^-\to
K^+K^-\pi^-$ and $B^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$, within the factorization approach. The main results
are: (i) There are two distinct sources of nonresonant contributions: one arises from the $b\to
u$ tree transition and the other from the nonresonant matrix element of scalar densities $\langle
M_1M_2|\bar q_1 q_2|0\rangle^{\rm NR}$. It turns out that even for tree-dominated three-body
decays, dominant nonresonant contributions originate from the penguin diagram rather than from
the $b\to u$ tree process, as implied by the large nonresonant component observed recently in the
$\pi^- K^+$ system which accounts for one third of the $B^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ rate. (ii) The calculated
branching fraction of $B^-\to f_2(1270)\pi^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ is smaller than the LHCb by a factor
of $\sim 7$ in its central value, but the predicted $\B(B^-\to f_2(1270)\pi^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-)$
is consistent with the data. Branching fractions of $B^-\to f_2(1270)\pi^-$ extracted from the
LHCb measurements of these two processes also differ by a factor of seven! Therefore, it is likely
that the $f_2(1270)$ contribution to $B^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ is largely overestimated experimentally.
Including $1/m_b$ power corrections from penguin annihilation inferred from QCD factorization
(QCDF), a sizable CP asymmetry of 32\% in the $f_2(1270)$ component agrees with experiment. (iii)
A fraction of 5\% for the $\rho(1450)$ component in $B^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$ is in accordance with
the theoretical expectation. However, a large fraction of 30\% in $B^-\to K^+K^-\pi^-$ is entirely
unexpected. This issue needs to be clarified in the future.
