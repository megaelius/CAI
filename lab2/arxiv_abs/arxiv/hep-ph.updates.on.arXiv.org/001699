In the present work, we have extended the standard model by an abelian $U(1)_{X}$ gauge group and
additional particles. In particular, we have extended the particle content by three right handed
neutrinos, two singlet scalars and two vector like leptons. Charged assignments under different
gauge groups are such that the model is gauge anomaly free and the anomaly contributions cancel among
generations. Once the symmetry gets broken then three physical Higgses are produced, one axion
like particle (ALP), which also acts as the keV scale FIMP dark matter, is produced and the remaining
component is absorbed by the extra gauge boson. Firstly, we have successfully generated neutrino
mass by the type-I seesaw mechanism for normal hierarchy with the $3\sigma$ bound on the oscillation
parameters. The ALP in the present model can explain the Xenon-1T electron recoil signal at keV scale
through its coupling with the electron. We also have vector like leptons which help in producing
the dark matter from their decay by the freeze in mechanism. Electron and tauon get mass from dimensional-5
operators at Planck scale and if we consider the vevs $v_{1,2} \simeq 10^{12}$ GeV then we can obtain
the correct value of the electron mass but not the tauon mass. Vector like leptons help in getting
the correct value of the tauon mass through another higher dimensional operator which also has a
role in DM production by the $2 \rightarrow 2$ process, giving the correct ballpark value of relic
density for suitable reheat temperature of the Universe. We have shown that the ALP production by
the higher dimensional operator can explain the electron, tauon mass and Xenon-1T signal simultaneously
whereas the decay production can not explain all of them together.
