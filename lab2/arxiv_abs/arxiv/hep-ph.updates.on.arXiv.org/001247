Both the neutron skin thickness $\Delta R_{np}$ of atomic nuclei and the low-energy neutrino-nucleon
($\nu N$) interactions are of fundamental importance in nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics
as well as new physics beyond the standard model (SM) but largely uncertain currently, and the coherent
elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) provides a clean way to extract their information.
New physics beyond the SM may cause effectively a shift of the SM weak mixing angle $\theta_W$ in low-energy
$\nu N$ interactions, leading to an effective weak mixing angle $\theta^*_W$. By analyzing the
CE$\nu$NS data of the COHERENT experiment, we find that while a one-parameter fit to the COHERENT
data by varying $\Delta R_{np}$ produces $\Delta R^{\rm{CsI}}_{np} \simeq 0.68^{+0.91}_{-1.13}$
fm for CsI with an unrealistically large central value by fixing $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$ at the low-energy
SM value of $\sin^2\theta_W^{\rm{SM}} = 0.23857$, a two-dimensional fit by varying $\Delta R_{np}$
and $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$ leads to a strong positive correlation between $\Delta R_{np}$ and $\sin^2
\theta^*_W$ with significantly smaller central values of $\Delta R^{\rm {CsI}}_{np} \simeq 0.24_{-2.03}^{+2.30}$
fm and $\sin^2 \theta^*_W = 0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.13}$. Although the uncertainty is too large to claim
a determination of $\Delta R^{\rm{CsI}}_{np}$ and $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$, the present study suggests
that the multi-dimensional fit is important in future analyses of high-precision CE$\nu$NS data.
The implication of the possible deviation of $\sin^2 \theta^*_W$ from $\sin^2\theta_W^{\rm{SM}}$
on new physics beyond the SM is also discussed.
