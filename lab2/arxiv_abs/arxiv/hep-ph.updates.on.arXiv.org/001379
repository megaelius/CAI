Despite decades of research, we still lack a detailed quantitative understanding of the way quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) generates the spectrum of hadrons. Precise experimental studies of the hadron
excitation spectrum and the dynamics of hadrons help to improve models and to test effective theories
and lattice QCD simulations. In addition, QCD seems to allow hadrons beyond the three-quark and
quark-antiquark configurations of the constituent-quark model. These so-called exotic hadrons
contain additional constituent (anti)quarks or excited gluonic fields that contribute to the
quantum numbers of the hadron. The COMPASS experiment at CERN is studying the excitation spectrum
of light mesons composed of up, down, and strange quarks. The excited mesons are produced via the
strong interaction by scattering a 190 GeV/c pion beam off proton or nuclear targets. On heavy nuclear
targets, in addition the electromagnetic interaction contributes in the form of quasi-real photon
exchange at very low four-momentum transfer squared. COMPASS has performed the most comprehensive
analyses to date of isovector resonances decaying into multi-particle final states. In this review,
we give a general introduction into scattering theory and the employed partial-wave analysis techniques.
We also describe novel methods developed for the high-precision COMPASS data. The COMPASS results
are summarized and compared to previous measurements. In addition, we discuss possible signals
for exotic mesons and conclude that COMPASS data provide solid evidence for the existence of the
manifestly exotic $\pi_1(1600)$, which has quantum numbers forbidden for a quark-model state,
and of the $a_1(1420)$, which does not fit into the quark-model spectrum. By isolating the contributions
from quasi-real photon exchange, COMPASS has measured the radiative widths of the $a_2(1320)$
and, for the first time, that of the $\pi_2(1670)$.
