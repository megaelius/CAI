Pseudoscalars appearing in particle physics are reviewd systematically. From the fundamental
point of view at an ultra-violat completed theory, they can be light if they are realized as pseudo-Goldstone
bosons of some spontaneously broken global symmetries. The spontaneous breaking scale is parametrized
by the decay constant $f$. The global symmetry is defined by the lowest order terms allowed in the
effective theory consistent with the gauge symmetry in question. Since any global symmetry is known
to be broken at least by quantum gravitational effects, all pseudoscalars should be massive. The
mass scale is determined by $f$ and the explicit breaking terms $\Delta V$ in the effective potential
and also anomaly terms $\Delta\Lambda^4_G$ for some non-Abelian gauge groups $G$. The well-known
example by non-Abelian gauge group breaking is the potential for the "invisible" QCD axion, via
the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which constitutes a major part of this review. Even if there is no breaking
terms from gauge anomalies, there can be explicit breaking terms $\Delta V$ in the potential in which
case the leading term suppressed by $f$ determines the pseudoscalar mass scale. If the breaking
term is extremely small and the decay constant is trans-Planckian, the corresponding pseudoscalar
can be a candidate for a `quintessential axion'. In general, $(\Delta V)^{1/4}$ is considered to
be smaller than $f$, and hence the pseudo-Goldstone boson mass scales are considered to be smaller
than the decay constants. In such a case, the potential of the pseudo-Goldstone boson at the grand
unification scale is sufficiently flat near the top of the potential that it can be a good candidate
for an inflationary model, which is known as `natural inflation'. We review all these ideas in the
bosonic collective motion framework.
