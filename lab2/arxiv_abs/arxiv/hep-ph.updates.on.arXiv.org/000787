A set of eight self-consistent, time-dependent supernova (SN) simulations in three spatial dimensions
(3D) for 9 solar-mass and 20 solar-mass progenitors is evaluated for the presence of dipolar asymmetries
of the electron lepton-number emission as discovered by Tamborra et al. and termed lepton-number
emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). The simulations were performed with the Aenus-Alcar
neutrino/hydrodynamics code, which treats the energy- and velocity-dependent transport of neutrinos
of all flavors by a two-moment scheme with algebraic M1 closure. For each of the progenitors, results
with fully multi-dimensional (FMD) neutrino transport and with ray-by-ray-plus (RbR+) approximation
are considered for two different grid resolutions. While the 9 solar-mass models develop explosions,
the 20 solar-mass progenitor does not explode with the employed version of simplified neutrino
opacities. In all 3D models we observe the growth of substantial dipole amplitudes of the lepton-number
(electron neutrino minus antineutrino) flux with stable or slowly time-evolving direction and
overall properties fully consistent with the LESA phenomenon. Models with RbR+ transport develop
LESA dipoles somewhat faster and with temporarily higher amplitudes, but the FMD calculations
exhibit cleaner hemispheric asymmetries with a far more dominant dipole. In contrast, the RbR+
results display much wider multipole spectra of the neutrino-emission anisotropies with significant
power also in the quadrupole and higher-order modes. Our results disprove speculations that LESA
is a numerical artifact of RbR+ transport. We also discuss LESA as consequence of a dipolar convection
flow inside of the nascent neutron star and establish, tentatively, a connection to Chandrasekhar's
linear theory of thermal instability in spherical shells.
