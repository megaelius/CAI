We present a master formula describing the neutrinoless-double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$)
rate induced by lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators up to dimension nine in the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory. We provide an end-to-end framework connecting the possibly very high LNV
scale to the nuclear scale, through a chain of effective field theories. Starting at the electroweak
scale, we integrate out the heavy Standard Model degrees of freedom and we match to an $SU(3)_c\otimes
U(1)_{\mathrm{em}}$ effective theory. After evolving the resulting effective Lagrangian to
the QCD scale, we use chiral perturbation theory to derive the lepton-number-violating chiral
Lagrangian. The chiral Lagrangian is used to derive the two-nucleon $0\nu\beta\beta$ transition
operators to leading order in the chiral power counting. Based on renormalization arguments we
show that in various cases short-range two-nucleon operators need to be enhanced to leading order.
We show that all required nuclear matrix elements can be taken from existing calculations. Our final
result is a master formula that describes the $0\nu\beta\beta$ rate in terms of phase-space factors,
nuclear matrix elements, hadronic low-energy constants, QCD evolution factors, and high-energy
LNV Wilson coefficients, including all the interference terms. Our master formula can be easily
matched to any model where LNV originates at energy scales above the electroweak scale. As an explicit
example, we match our formula to the minimal left-right-symmetric model in which contributions
of operators of different dimension compete, and we discuss the resulting phenomenology.
