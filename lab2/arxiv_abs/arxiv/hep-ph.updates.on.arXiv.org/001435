We investigate neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in the presence of sterile neutrinos
with Majorana mass terms. These gauge-singlet fields are allowed to interact with Standard-Model
(SM) fields via renormalizable Yukawa couplings as well as higher-dimensional gauge-invariant
operators up to dimension seven in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory extended with sterile
neutrinos. At the GeV scale, we use Chiral effective field theory involving sterile neutrinos to
connect the operators at the level of quarks and gluons to hadronic interactions involving pions
and nucleons. This allows us to derive an expression for $0\nu\beta\beta$ rates for various isotopes
in terms of phase-space factors, hadronic low-energy constants, nuclear matrix elements, the
neutrino masses, and the Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators. The needed hadronic
low-energy constants and nuclear matrix elements depend on the neutrino masses, for which we obtain
interpolation formulae grounded in QCD and chiral perturbation theory that improve existing formulae
that are only valid in a small regime of neutrino masses. The resulting framework can be used directly
to assess the impact of $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments on scenarios with light sterile neutrinos
and should prove useful in global analyses of sterile-neutrino searches. We perform several phenomenological
studies of $0\nu\beta\beta$ in the presence of sterile neutrinos with and without higher-dimensional
operators. We find that non-standard interactions involving sterile neutrinos have a dramatic
impact on $0\nu\beta\beta$ phenomenology, and next-generation experiments can probe such interactions
up to scales of $\mathcal O(100)$ TeV.
