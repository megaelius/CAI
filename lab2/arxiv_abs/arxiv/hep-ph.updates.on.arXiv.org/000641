Both collision geometry and event-by-event fluctuations are encoded in the experimentally observed
flow harmonic distribution $p(v_n)$ and $2k$-particle cumulants $c_n\{2k\}$. In the present
study, we systematically connect these observables to each other and quantify the deviation of
$p(v_n)$ from Bessel-Gaussianity in terms of cumulants $c_n\{2k\}$. We employ Gram-Charlier
A series, a well-known method in statistics, to associate $p(v_n)$ with $c_n\{2k\}$. We show that
the corrected Bessel-Gaussian distribution can fit the simulation data better than the Bessel-Gaussian
distribution in the more peripheral collisions. Inspired by Gram-Charlier A series, we introduce
a new set of cumulants $q_n\{2k\}$ that are more natural to study distributions near Bessel-Gaussian.
These new cumulants are obtained from $c_n\{2k\}$ where the collision geometry effect is extracted
from it, and the effect of fluctuations is remained. For $n=2$, the non-vanishing $q_2\{2k\}$ for
$k>1$, which can be written in terms of fine-splitting $v_2\{2p\}-v_2\{2q\}$, indicates the non-Bessel-Gaussianity
of $p(v_2)$. We know that the averaged ellipticity $\bar{v}_2$ is non-zero due to the collision
geometry in the non-central collisions. By exploiting $q_2\{2k\}$, we introduce a new set of estimators,
namely $v_2\{6\}-\sqrt{v_2\{6\}(v_2\{4\}-v_2\{6\})}$ for averaged ellipticity. Based on
the event-by-event hydrodynamic calculations, these estimators are more accurate compared to
$v_2\{2k\}$ for $k>1$. As another application of $q_2\{2k\}$, we show we are able to restrict the
phase space of $v_2\{4\}$, $v_2\{6\}$ and $v_2\{8\}$ by demanding the consistency of $\bar{v}_2$
and $v_2\{2k\}$ with $q_2\{2k\}$ equation. The allowed phase space is a region such that $v_2\{4\}-v_2\{6\}\gtrsim
0$ and $12 v_2\{6\}-11v_2\{8\}-v_2\{4\}\gtrsim 0$, which is compatible with the experimental
observations.
