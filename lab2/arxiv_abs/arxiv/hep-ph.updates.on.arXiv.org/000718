We include $p p \to p \Delta^{+} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ and $p p \to \Delta^{+} \Delta^{+} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$
processes in addition to the standard $p p \to p p \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ process both in equivalent-photon
approximation (EPA) and in exact $2 \to 4$ calculations. For comparison we calculate also the continuum
proton dissociation in a recently developed $k_{t}$-factorization approach to $\gamma \gamma$-involved
processes with parametrizations of $F_{2}$ structure function known from the literature. The
calculated cross section including all the processes is considerably larger than the one measured
recently by the ATLAS collaboration. We calculate absorption effects for $p p \to p p \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$
process in the momentum space. The final cross section with absorption effects is by 10\% larger
than the one measured by the ATLAS collaboration which is difficult to explain. Several differential
distributions with the ATLAS experimental cuts are presented. It is shown that the processes with
electromagnetic $p \to \Delta(1232)$ and $p \to N(1440)$ transitions, that have similar characteristics
as the $p p \to p p \mu^+ \mu^-$ process, increase the cross section for $\mu^+ \mu^-$ production and
thus can affect its theoretical interpretation when the leading baryons are not detected as is the
case for the CMS and ATLAS measurements. The mechanism of dissociation into hadronic continuum
is not under full control as the corresponding absorption effects are not fully understood. We present
first predictions for future ATLAS experiment with the ALFA sub-detectors and discuss observables
relevant for this measurement.
