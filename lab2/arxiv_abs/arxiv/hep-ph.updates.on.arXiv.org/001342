Using generic (non)extensive statistics, in which the underlying system autonomously manifests
its extensive and nonextensive statistical nature, we extract various fit parameters from the
CMS experiment and compare these to the corresponding results obtained from Tsallis and Boltzmann
statistics. The present study is designed to indicate the possible variations between the three
types of statistical approaches and characterizes their dependence on collision energy, multiplicity,
and size of the system of interest. We analyze the transverse momentum spectra $p_T$ of the strange
hadrons \Kslxi produced in Pb+Pb collisions, at 2.76 TeV, in p+Pb collisions, at 5.02 TeV, and in
$p+p$ collisions, at 7 TeV. From the comparison of the resulting fit parameters; temperature $T$,
volume $V$, and nonextensvie parameter $d$, with calculations based on Tsallis and Boltzmann statistics,
remarkable differences between the three types of statistics are determined besides a strong dependence
on size and type of the colliding system. We conclude that the produced particles with large masses
and large strange quantum numbers likely freeze out earlier than the ones with smaller masses and
less strange quantum numbers. This conclusion seems not depending on the type of the particle or
the collision but apparently manifesting transitions from chemical (larger temperature) to the
kinetic freezeouts (lower temperature). For the first university (equivalent) class c=1, the
decrease in the second one, $d$, with increasing energy and collision centrality highlights that
the system departs from nonextensivity (non-equilibrium) and apparently approaches extensivity
(equilibrium) indicating that the Boltzmann statistics becomes the proper statistical approach
in describing that system. Last but not least, we present analytical expressions for the energy
dependence of the various fit parameters.
