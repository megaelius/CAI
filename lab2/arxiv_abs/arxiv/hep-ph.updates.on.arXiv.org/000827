Experiments at the LHC are collecting a wealth of data with an unprecedented level of precision.
As a consequence, the theoretical error is now starting to lag behind the experimental one, and a
ceaseless effort is required to reduce the theory uncertainty to match the precision of the data.
At hadron colliders, QCD predictions are obtained by convoluting perturbative parton-level results
with non-perturbative PDFs, whose precise determination is crucial to reach percent-accurate
theoretical predictions. At the parton level, cross sections are obtained through a perturbative
expansion in the strong coupling. In some cases, large terms appear at all orders and spoil the convergence
of the series. The perturbative description is rescued by resumming the series to all orders, thereby
making theory calculations accurate in regions where a fixed-order treatment is not sufficient.
In this thesis I first present two global PDF sets where fixed-order calculations are supplemented
by threshold and high-energy resummation, respectively. In the first case, it is found that including
resummation into PDFs can compensate for the enhancement in the partonic cross sections, with implications
for high-mass resonance searches. In the second case, resummation quantitatively improves the
description of the HERA structure functions, thus providing evidence of the onset of a new dynamical
regime of QCD in the HERA data. I then focus on Higgs production in gluon fusion. The effect of threshold
resummation on the total cross section is found to significantly improve the convergence of the
perturbative series and to provide a robust method for estimating missing higher order uncertainty.
Finally, I present predictions for the Higgs transverse-momentum spectrum both in the inclusive
case and within fiducial cuts, exploiting a novel approach where transverse-momentum resummation
is performed in direct space.
