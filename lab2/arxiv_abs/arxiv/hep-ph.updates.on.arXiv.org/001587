Measurements of a permanent neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) potentially probe Beyond-the-Standard
Model (BSM) sources of CP-violation. At low energy the CP-violating BSM interactions are parametrized
by flavor-conserving CP-violating operators of dimension higher than four. QCD calculations
of the nucleon matrix elements of these operators are required to fully reconstruct the sources
and magnitudes of the different CP-violating contributions to the nucleon EDM. Herein we study
the quark-chromo electric dipole moment (qCEDM) operator and the three-gluon Weinberg operator.
The non-perturbative determination, using lattice QCD, of the nucleon matrix elements of these
CP-violating operators is hampered by their short-distance behavior. Under renormalization
these operators mix with lower dimensional operators, which induces power divergences in the lattice
spacing, as the continuum limit is approached. We study the short-distance behavior of the qCEDM
and the Weinberg operators using the gradient flow. We perform a short flow time expansion and determine,
in perturbation theory, the expansion coefficients of the linearly-divergent terms stemming
from the mixing with the pseudoscalar density and the topological charge, confirming the expectations
of the operator product expansion. We introduce a new method to perform calculations at non-zero
flow-time for arbitrary values of the external momenta. This method allows us to work in four dimensions
for most of the calculations described in this paper, avoiding the complications associated with
defining $\gamma_5$ in generic d dimensions. We show that leading contributions in the external
momenta can be reproduced by defining $\gamma_5$ using the 't Hooft-Veltman-Breitenlohner-Maison
scheme.
