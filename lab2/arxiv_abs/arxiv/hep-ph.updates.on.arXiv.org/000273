We perform a detailed study of the signal rate of the lightest Higgs boson in the diphoton channel
($\mu_{\gamma \gamma}$), recently analyzed by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large
Hadron Collider, in the framework of $U(1)_R-$ lepton number model with a right handed neutrino
superfield. The corresponding neutrino Yukawa coupling, `$f$', plays a very important role in
the phenomenology of this model. A large value of $f\sim\mathcal O(1)$ provides an additional tree
level contribution to the lightest Higgs boson mass along with a very light (mass $\sim$ a few hundred
MeV) bino like neutralino and a small tree level mass of one of the active neutrinos that is compatible
with various experimental results. In the presence of this light neutralino, the total decay width
of the Higgs boson and its various branching fractions are affected. When studied in conjunction
with the recent LHC results, these put significant constraints on the parameter space. The signal
rate $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}$ obtained in this scenario is compatible with the recent results from
both the ATLAS and the CMS collaborations at 1$\sigma$ level. A small value of `$f$', on the other
hand, is compatible with a sterile neutrino acting as a 7 keV dark matter that can explain the observation
of a mono-energetic X-ray photon line by the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory. Because of the absence
of a light neutralino, the total decay width of the lightest Higgs boson in this case remains close
to the SM expectation. Hence, in the small `$f$' scenario we obtain a relatively larger value of $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}$
which is closer to the central values reported recently by these two collaborations.
