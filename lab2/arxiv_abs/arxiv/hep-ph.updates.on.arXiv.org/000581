We identify new astrophysical signatures of dark matter that implodes neutron stars (NSs), which
could decisively test whether NS-imploding dark matter is responsible for missing pulsars in the
Milky Way galactic center, the source of some $r$-process elements, and the origin of fast-radio
bursts. First, NS-imploding dark matter forms $\sim 10^{-10}$ solar mass or smaller black holes
inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into $\sim$1.5 solar mass BHs. This
decreases the number of neutron star mergers seen by LIGO/Virgo (LV) and associated merger kilonovae
seen by telescopes like DES, BlackGEM, and ZTF, and instead, producing a population of "black mergers"
containing $\sim$1.5 solar mass black holes. Second, dark matter-induced neutron star implosions
may create a new kind of kilonovae that lacks a detectable, accompanying gravitational signal,
which we call "quiet kilonovae." Using DES data and the Milky Way's r-process abundance, we constrain
quiet kilonovae. Third, the spatial distribution of neutron star merger kilonovae and quiet kilonovae
in galaxies can be used to detect dark matter. NS-imploding dark matter destroys most neutron stars
at the centers of disc galaxies, so that neutron star merger kilonovae would appear mostly in a donut
at large radii. We find that as few as ten neutron star merger kilonova events, located to $\sim$1
kpc precision could validate or exclude dark matter-induced neutron star implosions at $2 \sigma$
confidence, exploring dark matter-nucleon cross-sections 4-10 orders of magnitude below current
direct detection experimental limits. Similarly, NS-imploding dark matter as the source of fast
radio bursts can be tested at $2 \sigma$ confidence once 20 bursts are located in host galaxies by
radio arrays like CHIME and HIRAX.
