A recent work [2006.16996] suggests that a 4d nonperturbative global anomaly of mod 16 class hinting
a possible new hidden gapped topological sector beyond the Standard Model (SM) and Georgi-Glashow
$su(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with 15n chiral Weyl fermions and a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$
symmetry of $X=5({\bf B- L})-4Y$. This $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ class global anomaly is a mixed gauge-gravitational
anomaly between the discrete $X$ and spacetime backgrounds. The new topological sector has a GUT
scale high energy gap, below its low energy encodes either a 4d noninvertible topological quantum
field theory (TQFT), or a 5d short-range entangled invertible TQFT, or their combinations. This
hidden topological sector provides the 't Hooft anomaly matching of the missing sterile right-handed
neutrinos (3 generations of 16th Weyl fermions), and possibly also accounts for the Dark Matter
sector. In the SM and $su(5)$ GUT, the discrete $X$ can be either a global symmetry or gauged. In the
$so(10)$ GUT, the $X$ must become gauged, the 5d TQFT becomes noninvertible and long-range entangled
(which can couple to dynamical gravity). In this work, we further examine the anomaly and cobordism
constraints at higher energy scales above the $su(5)$ GUT to $so(10)$ GUT and $so(18)$ GUT (with
Spin(10) and Spin(18) gauge groups precisely). We also find [2006.16996]'s proposal on new hidden
gapped topological sectors can be consistent with anomaly matching under the energy/mass hierarchy.
Novel ingredients along tuning the energy include various energy scales of anomaly-free symmetric
mass generation (i.e., Kitaev-Wen mechanism), the Topological Mass/Energy Gap from anomalous
symmetric topological order (attachable to a 5d $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$-symmetric topological superconductor),
possible topological quantum phase transitions, and Ultra Unification that includes GUT with
new topological sectors.
