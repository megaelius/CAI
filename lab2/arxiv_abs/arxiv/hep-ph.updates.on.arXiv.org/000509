Various methods are used in the literature for predicting the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass
in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Fixed-order diagrammatic calculations
capture all effects at a given order and yield accurate results for scales of supersymmetric (SUSY)
particles that are not separated too much from the weak scale. Effective field theory calculations
allow a resummation of large logarithmic contributions up to all orders and therefore yield accurate
results for a high SUSY scale. A hybrid approach, where both methods have been combined, is implemented
in the computer code FeynHiggs. So far, however, at large scales sizeable differences have been
observed between FeynHiggs and other pure EFT codes. In this work, the various approaches are analytically
compared with each other in a simple scenario in which all SUSY mass scales are chosen to be equal to
each other. Three main sources are identified that account for the major part of the observed differences.
Firstly, it is shown that the scheme conversion of the input parameters that is commonly used for
the comparison of fixed-order results is not adequate for the comparison of results containing
a series of higher-order logarithms. Secondly, the treatment of higher-order terms arising from
the determination of the Higgs propagator pole is addressed. Thirdly, the effect of different parametrizations
in particular of the top Yukawa coupling in the non-logarithmic terms is investigated. Taking into
account all of these effects, in the considered simple scenario very good agreement is found for
scales above 1 TeV between the results obtained using the EFT approach and the hybrid approach of
FeynHiggs.
