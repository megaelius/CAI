The discrepancy between the Standard Model theory and experimental measurement of the muon magnetic
moment anomaly, $a_{\mu}=\left(g_{\mu}-2\right)/2$, is connected to precision electroweak
(EW) predictions via their common dependence on hadronic vacuum polarization effects. The same
data for the total $e^+e^- \rightarrow \text{hadrons}$ cross section, $\sigma_{\rm had}(s)$,
are used as input into dispersion relations to estimate the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions,
$a_{\mu}^{\rm had,\,VP}$, as well as the five-flavor hadronic contribution to the running QED
coupling at the $Z$-pole, $\Delta\alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_{Z}^2)$, which enters natural relations
and global EW fits. The EW fit prediction of $\Delta\alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_{Z}^2) = 0.02722(41)$
agrees well with $\Delta\alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_{Z}^2) = 0.02761(11)$ obtained from the dispersion
relation approach, but exhibits a smaller central value suggestive of a larger discrepancy $\Delta
a_{\mu}=a_{\mu}^{\rm exp} - a_{\mu}^{\rm SM}$ than currently expected. Postulating that the
$\Delta a_{\mu}$ difference may be due to missing $\sigma_{\rm had}(s)$ contributions, implications
for $M_W$, $\sin^2 \! \theta^{\rm lep}_{\rm eff}$ and $M_H$ obtained from global EW fits are investigated.
Shifts in $\sigma_{\rm had}(s)$ needed to bridge $\Delta a_{\mu}$ are found to be excluded above
$\sqrt{s} \gtrsim 0.7$ GeV at the 95\%CL. Moreover, prospects for $\Delta a_{\mu}$ originating
below that energy are deemed improbable given the required increases in the cross section. Such
hypothetical changes to the hadronic data are also found to affect other related observables, such
as the electron anomaly, $a_e^{\rm SM}$, the ratio $R_{e/\mu} = (m_\mu/m_e)^2 (a_{e}^{\rm had,\,LO\,VP}/a_{\mu}^{\rm
had,\,LO\,VP})$ and the running of the weak mixing angle at low energies, although the consequences
of these are currently less constraining.
