We seek to obtain a usable form of the nuclear energy density functional that is rooted in the modern
theory of nuclear forces. We thus consider a functional obtained from the density matrix expansion
of local nuclear potentials from chiral effective field theory. We propose a parametrization of
this functional carefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that
is suitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. The first component of this functional
is a non-local functional of the density and corresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the
expectation value of local chiral potentials on a Slater determinant. A second component is a local
functional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix expansion to the exchange
part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the local chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization
protocol to determine the coupling constants of this energy functional. We obtain a set of microscopically-constrained
functionals for local chiral potentials from leading-order up to next-to-next-to-leading order
with and without three-body forces and contributions from $\Delta$ excitations. These functionals
are validated on the calculation of nuclear and neutron matter, nuclear mass tables, single-particle
shell structure in closed-shell nuclei and the fission barrier of $^{240}$Pu. Quantitatively,
they perform noticeable better than the more phenomenological Skyrme functionals. The inclusion
of higher-order terms in the chiral perturbation expansion seems to produce a systematic improvement
in predicting nuclear binding energies. This result is especially promising since all the fits
have been performed at the single reference level of the energy density functional approach, where
important collective correlations such as center-of-mass correction have not been taken into
account yet.
