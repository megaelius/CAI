In Part I (in this journal) we argued that the structure function $F_2^{\gamma p}(x,Q^2)$ in deep
inelastic $ep$ scattering, regarded as a cross section for virtual $\gamma^*p$ scattering, has
a saturated Froissart-bounded form behaving as $\ln^2 (1/x)$ at small $x$. This form provides an
excellent fit to the low $x$ HERA data, including the very low $Q^2$ regions, and can be extrapolated
reliably to small $x$ using the natural variable $\ln(1/x)$. We used our fit to derive quark distributions
for values of $x$ down to $x=10^{-14}$. We use those distributions here to evaluate ultra-high energy
(UHE) cross sections for neutrino scattering on an isoscalar nucleon, $N=(n+p)/2$, up to laboratory
neutrino energies $E_\nu \sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}$ GeV where there are now limits on neutrino fluxes.
We estimate that these cross sections are accurate to $\sim$2% at the highest energies considered,
with the major uncertainty coming from the errors in the parameters that were needed to fit $F_2^{\gamma
p}(x,Q^2)$. We compare our results to recently published neutrino cross sections derived from
NLO parton distribution functions, which become much larger at high energies because of the use
of power-law extrapolations of quark distributions to small $x$. We argue that our calculation
of the UHE $\nu N$ cross sections is the best one can make based the existing experimental deep inelastic
scattering data. Further, we show that the strong interaction Froissart bound of $\ln^2 (1/x)$
on $F_2^{\gamma p}$ translates to an exact bound of $\ln^3E_\nu$ for leading-order-weak $\nu N$
scattering. The energy dependence of $\nu N$ total cross section measurements consequently has
important implications for hadronic interactions at enormous cms (center-of-mass) energies
not otherwise accessible.
