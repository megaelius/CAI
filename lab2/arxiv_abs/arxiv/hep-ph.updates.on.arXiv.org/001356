As an extension of our previous work [J.Qiao, T.Zhu, W.Zhao & A.Wang, arXiv:1909.03815], in this
article, we calculate the effects of parity violation on gravitational-wave (GW) waveforms during
their propagation in the most general parity-violating gravities, including Chern-Simons modified
gravity, ghost-free scalar-tensor gravity, symmetric teleparallel equivalence of GR theory,
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity and so on. For this purpose, we consider the GWs generated by the coalescence
of compact binaries and concentrate on the imprints of the parity violation in the propagation of
GWs. With a unified description of GW in the theories of parity-violating gravity, we study the effects
of velocity and amplitude birefringence on the GW waveforms. Decomposing the GWs into the circular
polarization modes, the two birefringence effects exactly correspond to the modifications in
phase and amplitude of GW waveforms respectively. We find that, for each circular polarization
mode, the amplitude, phase and velocity of GW can be modified by both the parity-violating terms
and parity-conserving terms in gravity. Therefore, in order to test the parity symmetry in gravity,
we should compare the difference between two circular polarization modes, rather than measuring
an individual mode. Combining two circular modes, we obtain the GW waveforms in the Fourier domain,
and obtain the deviations from those in General Relativity. The GW waveforms derived in this paper
are also applicable to the theories of parity-conserving gravity, which have the modified dispersion
relations (e.g. massive gravity, double special relativity theory, extra-dimensional theories,
etc), or/and have the modified friction terms (e.g. nonlocal gravity, gravitational theory with
time-dependent Planck mass, etc).
