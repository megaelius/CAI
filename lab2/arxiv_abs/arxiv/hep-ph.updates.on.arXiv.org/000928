We develop an effective-model description arising from a recently proposed scale-invariant hidden
scalar-QCD sector,which has been used to explain the dynamical origin of the electroweak scale.
In addition to the previous works, our new effective model includes the dynamical scale-anomaly
effect from the hidden QCD gluons, to explicitly break the classical-scale invariance at the level
of an effective field theory, which is known as the leading-order scale-symmetry (LOSS). In the
phenomenological analysis, the proposed model predicts a light composite dilaton composed of
hidden scalar quarks and gluons with the mass around electroweak scale (around 280 GeV), and has
only one input parameter, which is the mixing angle between the Higgs boson and the composite dilaton.
Our result for the dilaton mass is in accord with the lattice simulation for scalar QCD, where the
scalar-quark bound states acquire a large effective mass from the hidden gluon contribution. Furthermore,
we predict several significant deviations from the SM, like the resonant and non-resonant diHiggs
production cross sections (maximally about 6.8 times larger than the SM prediction), that could
be directly tested at the high luminosity LHC. It is also the first study for the diHiggs production
signal predicted from a scale(conformal)-invariant hidden sector, even from dark/hidden QCD.
Our proposed effective model is thus significantly different than the conventional realization
of scale-invariant hidden-scalar QCD without the scale anomaly effect, and can potentially provide
a competitive explanation for many exotic phenomena beyond the standard model, such as new dark
matter candidates and a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition.
