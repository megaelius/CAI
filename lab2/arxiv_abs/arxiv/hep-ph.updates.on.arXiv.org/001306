We investigate the confinement-deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature of the SU(3)
Yang-Mills(YM) theory on the lattice from a viewpoint of the dual superconductor picture based
on the novel reformulation of the YM theory. In particular, we compare the conventional Abelian
dual superconductor picture with the non-Abelian dual superconductor picture proposed in our
previous works as the mechanism of quark confinement in the SU(3) YM theory. For the SU(3) YM theory,
the reformulation allows two possible options called maximal and minimal. The maximal option corresponds
to the manifestly gauge-invariant extension of the Abelian projection scheme, while the minimal
option is really new to give the non-Abelian dual superconductor picture. Keeping these differences
in mind, we present the numerical evidences that the confinement/deconfinement phase transition
is caused by appearance/disappearance of the dual Meissner effects. First, we measure the Polyakov
loop average at various temperatures to determine the critical temperature separating the low-temperature
confined phase and the high-temperature deconfined phase. Second, we measure the static quark-antiquark
potential. Third, we measure the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic flux created by a pair of quark
and antiquark at temperatures below and above the critical temperature. We observe no more squeezing
of the chromoelectric flux tube above the critical temperature. Finally, we measure the associated
magnetic--monopole current induced around the chromo-flux tube and observe that the confinement/deconfinement
phase transition is associated with the appearance/disappearance of the induced magnetic--monopole
current, respectively. We confirm that these results are also obtained by the restricted field
alone in both options, indicating the restricted field dominance in quark confinement at finite
temperature.
