Kaon condensation in compact-star matter can be considered as a quantum critical phenomenon with
the kaon mass tuned to zero by the baryon density plus the electron chemical potential that increases
at the increase of the density. We approach this problem with a renormalization group flow at one
loop of the system of anti-kaons considered as pseudo-Goldstone bosons coupled to nucleonic matter
described as a Fermi liquid near its fixed point. While the Weinberg-Tomozawa term in chiral Lagrangians
is of leading order in describing kaon-nucleon interactions in chiral perturbation theory, hence
widely employed in the literature, it is irrelevant in the RG sense, therefore plays, if any, a less
important role in the condensation process. The consequence is that the $\Lambda (1405)$ resonance
which is driven by the Weinberg-Tomozawa term is irrelevant for triggering kaon condensation.
On the contrary, the $KN$ sigma term $\Sigma_{KN}$, subleading in chiral counting, can play a more
crucial role in renormalization group flow by becoming "relevant" under certain kinematic (or
dynamical) conditions and play the driving role for the kaons to condense. In the chemical and weak
equilibrium present in the compact-star matter, the electron chemical potential can effectively
tune the kaon mass, together with increasing density due to gravity, so as to drive kaons to condense
at a relatively low density and will affect significantly the EoS of compact stars. It is suggested
that hidden local symmetry can play a significant role in the process at a density commensurate with
the appearance of strangeness in compressed baryonic matter.
