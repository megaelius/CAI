Based on the renormalization group summation method of McKeon ${\it et\; al.}$, it is shown that
the renormalization group equation, while related to the radiatively mass scale $\mu$, would perform
a summation over QCD perturbative terms. Employing the full QCD $\beta$-function within this summation,
all logarithmic corrections can be presented as log-independent contributions. In another step
of this approach, the renormalization scheme dependence of QCD observables, characterized by
Stevenson, is required to be examined. In this regard, two choices of renormalization scheme would
be exposed. In one of them, the QCD observable is expressed in terms of two powers of running coupling
constant. In the other one, the perturbative series expansion is written as an infinite series in
terms of the two-loop running coupling represented by the Lambert $W$-function. In both cases,
the QCD observable involves parameters which are renormalization scheme invariant and a coupling
constant which is independent of the renormalization scale. We then consider the approach of complete
renormalization group improvement (CORGI). In this approach, using the self consistency principle,
it is possible to reconstruct the conventional perturbative series in terms of scheme invariant
quantities and the coupling constant as a function of Lambert $W$-function. One of the key differences
between CORGI and the renormalization group summation method of McKeon ${\it et\; al.}$ is that
the later treats renormalization scale and scheme independently while the former would encounter
both dependencies together. In continuation, numerical results of the two approaches are compared
for $R_{e^+e^-}$ ratio and the Higgs decay width to gluon-gluon.
