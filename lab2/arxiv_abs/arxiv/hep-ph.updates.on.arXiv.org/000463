We study the nucleon electromagnetic (EM) form factors in symmetric nuclear matter as well as in
vacuum within a light-front approach using the in-medium inputs calculated by the quark-meson
coupling model. The same in-medium quark properties are used as those used for the study of in-medium
pion properties. The zero of the proton EM form factor ratio in vacuum, the electric to magnetic form
factor ratio $\mu_p G_{Ep}(Q^2)/G_{Mp}(Q^2)$ ($Q^2 = -q^2 > 0$ with $q$ being the four-momentum
transfer), is determined including the latest experimental data by implementing a hard constituent
quark component in the nucleon wave function. A reasonable fit is achieved for the ratio $\mu_pG_{Ep}(Q^2)/G_{Mp}(Q^2)$
in vacuum, and we predict that the $Q_0^2$ value to cross the zero of the ratio to be about 15 GeV$^2$.
In addition the double ratio data of the proton EM form factors in $^4$He and H nuclei, $[G^{^4{\rm
He}}_{Ep}(Q^2)/G^{^4{\rm He}}_{Mp}(Q^2)]/[G^{^1{\rm H}}_{Ep}(Q^2)/G^{^1{\rm H}}_{Mp}(Q^2)]$,
extracted by the polarized ($\vec{e}, e' \vec{p}$) scattering experiment on $^4$He at JLab, are
well described. We also predict that the $Q_0^2$ value satisfying $\mu_pG_{Ep}(Q_0^2)/G_{Mp}(Q_0^2)
= 0$ in symmetric nuclear matter, shifts to a smaller value as increasing nuclear matter density,
which reflects the facts that the faster falloff of $G_{Ep}(Q^2)$ as increasing $Q^2$ and the increase
of the proton mean-square charge radius. Furthermore, we calculate the neutron EM form factor double
ratio in symmetric nuclear matter for $0.1 < Q^2 < 1.0$ GeV$^2$. The result shows that the neutron
double ratio is enhanced relative to that in vacuum, while for the proton it is quenched, and agrees
with an existing theoretical prediction.
