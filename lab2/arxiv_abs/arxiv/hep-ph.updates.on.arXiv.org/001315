We classify and characterize fully all invertible anomalies and all allowed topological terms
related to various Standard Models (SM), Grand Unified Theories (GUT), and Beyond Standard Model
(BSM) physics. By all anomalies, we mean the inclusion of (1) perturbative/local anomalies captured
by Feynman diagram loop calculations, classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ free classes, and (2) non-perturbative/global
anomalies, classified by finite group $\mathbb{Z}_N$ torsion classes. Our theory built from [arXiv:1812.11967]
fuses the math tools of Adams spectral sequence, Thom-Madsen-Tillmann spectra, and Freed-Hopkins
theorem. For example, we compute bordism groups $\Omega^{H}_d$ and their invertible topological
field theory invariants, which characterize $d$d topological terms and $(d-1)$d anomalies, protected
by the following symmetry group $H$: ${{Spin\times \frac{SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)}{\Gamma_q}}}$
for SM with ${\Gamma_q} :=\mathbb{Z}_q$ as $q=1,2,3,6$; ${\frac{Spin \times Spin(n)}{\mathbb{Z}_2^F}}$
or ${Spin \times SO(n)}$ for SO(10) or SO(18) GUT as $n=10, 18$; ${Spin \times SU(n)}$ for Georgi-Glashow
SU(5) GUT as $n=5$; $(Spin\times \frac{SU(4)\times(SU(2)\times SU(2))}{\Gamma_q})/\mathbb{Z}_2^F$
for Pati-Salam GUT as $q=1,2$; etc. Our approach offers an alternative view of all anomaly matching
constraints built from the lower-energy (B)SM or GUT, in contrast to high-energy Quantum Gravity
or String Theory Swampland program, as bottom-up/top-down complements. Symmetries and anomalies
provide constraints of kinematics, we further comment on constraints of quantum gauge dynamics,
and new predictions of possible extended defects/excitations plus hidden BSM non-perturbative
topological sectors.
