Motivated by the persistent anomalies in the semileptonic $B$-meson decays, we investigate the
competency of the LHC data to constrain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$-favoured parameter space in two minimal
scenarios (I and II) with a charge $-1/3$ scalar leptoquark (LQ). Both the scenarios have only one
free coupling that has to be large to accommodate the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomalies. As a result, Scenario-I
dominantly yields non-resonant $\tau\tau$ and $\tau\nu$ events at the LHC through the $t$-channel
LQ exchange. So far, no experiment has searched for LQs using these signatures and the relevant resonant
LQ searches are yet to put any strong exclusion limit on the parameter space. We recast the latest
$\tau\tau$ and $\tau\nu$ resonance search data to obtain new exclusion limits in this scenario.
The non-resonant processes strongly interfere (destructively in our case) with the Standard Model
background and play the determining role in setting the exclusion limits. To obtain precise limits,
we include non-negligible effects coming from the sub-dominant (resonant) pair and inclusive
single LQ productions systematically in our analysis. To deal with a large destructive interference,
we make use of the transverse mass distributions from the experiments in our statistical analysis.
In addition, we also recast the relevant direct search results to obtain the most stringent limits
on our minimal scenarios to date. We find that the $R_{D^{(*)}}$-favoured parameter space in Scenario-I
is already ruled out by the LHC data, but it is largely allowed in Scenario-II. We also consider a next-to-minimal
scenario where both the free couplings from the minimal scenarios are present. If we ignore other
flavour or electroweak precision constraints and rely only on the LHC data, we find that it still
allows a sub-TeV LQ that can explain the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomalies with order electroweak couplings.
