In three spatial dimensions, the Compton wavelength $(R_C \propto M^{-1}$) and Schwarzschild
radius $(R_S \propto M$) are dual under the transformation $M \rightarrow M_{P}^2/M$, where $M_{P}$
is the Planck mass. This suggests that there is a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty
Principle or Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary particles in the $M
< M_{P}$ regime and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the presence of $n$ extra dimensions,
compactified on some scale $R_E$, one expects $R_S \propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R < R_E$, which breaks
this duality. However, it may be restored in some circumstances because the effective Compton wavelength
depends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is spherically symmetric,
then one still has $R_C \propto M^{-1}$, as in the $3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length
is then increased and the Planck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and
black hole production at the LHC. However, if the wave function is pancaked in the extra dimensions
and maximally asymmetric, then $R_C \propto M^{-1/(1+n)}$, so that the duality between $R_C$ and
$R_S$ is preserved. In this case, the effective Planck length is reduced but the Planck mass is unchanged,
so TeV quantum gravity is precluded and black holes cannot be generated in collider experiments.
Nevertheless, the extra dimensions could still have consequences for the detectability of black
hole evaporations and the enhancement of pair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$.
Though phenomenologically general for higher-dimensional theories, our results are shown to
be consistent with string theory via the minimum positional uncertainty derived from $D$-particle
scattering amplitudes.
