Physics beyond the Fermi scale could show up through deviations of the gauge couplings predicted
by the electroweak Yang-Mills sector. This possibility is explored in the context of the International
Linear Collider (ILC) through the helicity amplitudes for the gamma e -> W nu_e reaction to which
contributes the trilinear WWgamma coupling. The new physics effects on this vertex are parametrized
in a model-independent fashion through an effective electroweak Yang-Mills sector, which is constructed
by considering two essentially different sources of new physics. In one scenario, Lorentz violation
will be considered exclusively as the source of new physics effects. This type of new physics is considered
in an extension of the Standard Model that is known as the Standard Model Extension (SME), which is
an effective field theory that contemplates CPT and Lorentz violation in a model-independent fashion.
Any source of new physics that respects the Lorentz symmetry, will be considered within the general
context of the well known Conventional Effective Standard Model (CESM) extension. Both the SME
and the CESM descriptions include gauge invariant operators of dimension higher than four, which,
in general, transform as Lorentz tensors of rank higher than zero. Whereas in the former theory observer
Lorentz invariants are constructed by contracting these operators with constant Lorentz tensors,
in the latter the corresponding Lorentz invariant interactions are obtained contracting such
operators with products of the metric tensor. We focus our study on the possibility of experimentally
distinguish both types of new physics effects on the WWgamma vertex. It is found that for a new physics
scale of the same order of magnitude and under determined circumstances, both types of new physics
effects will be clearly distinguished.
