Over the past years, experiments accumulated intriguing hints for new physics (NP) in flavor observables,
namely in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu$), in $R(D^{(*)})={\rm Br}(B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu)/{\rm
Br}(B\to D^{(*)}\ell\nu)$ and in $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ transitions, which are all at the $3-4\,\sigma$
level. In this article we point out that one can explain the $R(D^{(*)})$ anomaly using two scalar
leptoquarks (LQs) with the same mass and coupling to fermions related via a discrete symmetry: an
$SU(2)$ singlet and an $SU(2)$ triplet, both with hypercharge $Y=-2/3$. In this way, potentially
dangerous contributions to $b\to s\nu\nu$ are avoided and non-CKM suppressed effects in $R(D^{(*)})$
can be generated. This allows for smaller overall couplings to fermions weakening the direct LHC
bounds. In our model, $R(D^{(*)})$ is directly correlated to $b\to s\tau^+\tau^-$ transitions
where an enhancement by orders of magnitude compared to the standard model (SM) is predicted, such
that these decay modes are in the reach of LHCb and BELLE II. Furthermore, one can also naturally explain
the $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ anomalies (including $R(K)$) by a $C_9=-C_{10}$ like contribution without
spoiling $\mu-e$ universality in charged current decays. In this case sizable effects in $b\to
s\tau\mu$ transitions are predicted which are again well within the experimental reach. One can
even address the longstanding anomaly in $a_\mu$, generating a sizable decay rate for $\tau\to\mu\gamma$.
However, we find that out of the three anomalies $R(D^{(*)})$, $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ and $a_{\mu}$
only two (but any two) can be explained simultaneously.
