We investigate the hypothesis that Coulomb-type interactions between dark matter (DM) and baryons
explain the anomalously low 21cm brightness-temperature minimum at redshift z ~ 17 that was recently
measured by the EDGES experiment. In particular, we reassess the validity of the scenario where
a small fraction of the total DM is millicharged, focusing on newly derived constraints from Planck
2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Crucially, the CMB power spectrum is sensitive to
DM-baryon scattering if the fraction of interacting DM is larger than (or comparable to) the fractional
uncertainty in the baryon energy density. Meanwhile, there is a mass-dependent lower limit on the
fraction for which the required interaction to cool the baryons sufficiently is so strong that it
drives the interacting-DM temperature to the baryon temperature prior to their decoupling from
the CMB. If this occurs as early as recombination, the cooling saturates. We precisely determine
the viable parameter space for millicharged DM, and find that only a fraction (m_chi/MeV) 0.0115%
<~ f <~ 0.4% of the entire DM content, and only for DM-particle masses between 0.5 MeV - 35 MeV, can be
charged at the level needed to marginally explain the anomaly, without violating limits from SLAC,
CMB, Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or stellar and SN1987A cooling. In reality, though, we demonstrate
that at least moderate fine tuning is required to both agree with the measured absorption profile
and overcome various astrophysical sources of heating. Finally, we point out that a ~0.4% millicharged
DM component which is tightly coupled to the baryons at recombination may resolve the current 2-sigma
tension between the BBN and CMB determinations of the baryon energy density. Future CMB-S4 measurements
will be able to probe this scenario directly.
