Using the production of a Higgs boson in association with a $W$ boson as a test case, we assess the impact
of dimension-8 operators within the context of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Dimension-8--SM-interference
and dimension-6-squared terms appear at the same order in an expansion in $1/\Lambda$, hence dimension-8
effects can be treated as a systematic uncertainty on the new physics inferred from analyses using
dimension-6 operators alone. To study the phenomenological consequences of dimension-8 operators,
one must first determine the complete set of operators that can contribute to a given process. We
accomplish this through a combination of Hilbert series methods, which yield the number of invariants
and their field content, and a step-by-step recipe to convert the Hilbert series output into a phenomenologically
useful format. The recipe we provide is general and applies to any other process within the dimension
$\le 8$ Standard Model Effective Theory. We quantify the effects of dimension-8 by turning on one
dimension-6 operator at a time and setting all dimension-8 operator coefficients to the same magnitude.
Under this procedure and given the current accuracy on $\sigma(pp \to h\,W^+)$, we find the effect
of dimension-8 operators on the inferred new physics scale to be small, $\mathcal O(\text{few}\,\%)$,
with some variation depending on the relative signs of the dimension-8 coefficients and on which
dimension-6 operator is considered. The impact of the dimension-8 terms grows as $\sigma(pp \to
h\,W^+)$ is measured more accurately or (more significantly) in high-mass kinematic regions.
We provide a FeynRules implementation of our operator set to be used for further more detailed analyses.
