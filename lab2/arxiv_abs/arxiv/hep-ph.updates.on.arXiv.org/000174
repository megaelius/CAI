We introduce a new fermionic variational wavefunction, generalizing the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) wavefunction, which is suitable for interacting multi-species spinful systems and sustaining
superfluidity. Applications range from quark matter to the high temperature superconductors.
A wide class of Hamiltonians, comprising interactions and hybridization of arbitrary momentum
dependence between different fermion species, can be treated in a comprehensive manner. This is
the case, as both the intra-species and the inter-species interactions are treated on equally rigorous
footing, which is accomplished via the introduction of a new quantum index attached to the fermions.
The index is consistent with known fermionic physics, and allows for heretofore unaccounted for
fermion-fermion correlations. We have derived the finite temperature version of the theory, thus
obtaining the renormalized quasiparticle dispersion relations, and we discuss the appearance
of charge and spin density wave order. We present numerical solutions for two electron species in
2 dimensions. Based on these solutions, we show that, for equivalent spin up and down fermions, the
Fermi occupation factor (per spin) equals 1/2 deep in the Fermi sea. This constitutes a unique experimental
prediction of the theory, both for the normal and superfluid states. Interestingly, this result,
obtained in the thermodynamic limit, is consistent with Fermi occupation factor (in-)equalities
for finite systems of electrons, derived (in a different context) by Borland and Dennis, J. Phys.
