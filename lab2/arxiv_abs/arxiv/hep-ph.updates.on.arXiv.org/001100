The $tthh$ production at colliders contain rich information on the nature of Higgs boson. In this
article, we systematically studied its physics at High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC),
using exclusive channels with multiple ($\geq 5$) $b$-jets and one lepton ($5b1\ell$), multiple
($\geq 5$) $b$-jets and opposite-sign di-lepton ($5b2\ell$), same-sign di-lepton (SS2$\ell$),
multiple leptons (multi-$\ell$), and di-tau resonance ($\tau\tau$). The scenarios analyzed
include: (1) the $tthh$ production in Standard Model; (2) the $tthh$ production mediated by anomalous
cubic Higgs self-coupling and $tthh$ contact interaction; (3) heavy Higgs ($H$) production with
$tt H \to tthh$; and (4) pair production of fermionic top partners ($T$) with $T T \to tthh$. To address
the complication of event topologies and the mess of combinatorial backgrounds, a tool of Boosted-Decision-Tree
was applied in the analyses. The $5b1\ell$ and SS2$\ell$ analyses define the two most promising
channels, resulting in slightly different sensitivities. For non-resonant $tthh$ production,
a combination of these exclusive analyses allows for its measurment in the SM with a statistical
significance $\sim 0.9\sigma$ (with $S/B > 1 \%$), and may assist partially breaking the sensitivity
degeneracy w.r.t. the cubic Higgs self-coupling, a difficulty usually thought to exist in gluon
fusion di-Higgs analysis at HL-LHC. These sensitivities were also projected to future hadron colliders
at 27 TeV and 100 TeV. For resonant $tthh$ productions, the heavy Higgs boson in type II Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model
could be efficiently searched for between the mass thresholds $2 m_h < m_H < 2 m_t$ and even beyond
that, for relatively small $\tan\beta$, while the fermionic top partners in composite Higgs models
could be probed for up to $\sim 1.5$ TeV and $\sim 1.7$ TeV, for Br$(T\to th)=25\%$ and $50\%$, respectively.
