The combined analysis of $\nu_\mu$ disappearance and $\nu_e$ appearance data of NO$\nu$A experiment
leads to three nearly degenerate solutions. This degeneracy can be understood in terms of deviations
in $\nu_e$ appearance signal, caused by unknown effects, with respect to the signal expected for
a reference set of oscillations parameters. We define the reference set to be vacuum oscillations
in the limit of maximal $\theta_{23}$ and no CP-violation. We then calculate the deviations induced
in the $\nu_e$ appearance signal event rate by three unknown effects: (a) matter effects, due to
normal or inverted hierarchy (b) octant effects, due to $\theta_{23}$ being in higher or lower octant
and (c) CP-violation, whether $\delta_{CP} \sim - \pi/2$ or $\delta_{CP} \sim \pi/2$. We find that
the deviation caused by each of these effects is the same for NO$\nu$A. The observed number of $\nu_e$
events in NO$\nu$A is equivalent to the increase caused by one of the effects. Therefore, the observed
number of $\nu_e$ appearance events of NO$\nu$A is the net result of the increase caused by two of
the unknown effects and the decrease caused by the third. Thus we get the three degenerate solutions.
We also find that further data by NO$\nu$A can not distinguish between these degenerate solutions
but addition of one year of neutrino run of DUNE can make a distinction between all three solutions.
The distinction between the two NH solutions and the IH solution becomes possible because of the
larger matter effect in DUNE. The distinction between the two NH solutions with different octants
is a result of the synergy between the anti-neutrino data of NO$\nu$A and the neutrino data of DUNE.
