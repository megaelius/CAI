Possibility of using the polarized electron target (PET) for testing the neutrino nature is considered.
One assumes that the incoming electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) beam is the superposition of left chiral
states with right chiral ones. Consequently the non-vanishing transversal components of $\nu_e$
spin polarization may appear, both T-even and T-odd. $\nu_e$s are produced by the low energy monochromatic
(un)polarized emitter located at a near distance from the hypothetical detector which is able to
measure both the azimuthal angle and polar angle of the recoil electrons, and/or also the energy
of the outgoing electrons with a high resolution. A detection process is the elastic scattering
of $\nu_e$s (Dirac or Majorana) on the polarized electrons. Left chiral (LC) $\nu_e$s interact
mainly by the standard $V - A$ interaction, while right chiral (RC) ones participate only in the non-standard
$V + A$, scalar $S_R$, pseudoscalar $P_R$ and tensor $T_R$ interactions. All the interactions are
of flavour-conserving type (FC). We show that a distinction between the Dirac and the Majorana $\nu_e$
s is possible both for the longitudinal and the transversal $\nu_e$ polarizations. In the first
case a departure from the standard prediction of the azimuthal asymmetry of recoil electrons is
caused by the interferences between the non-standard complex S and T couplings. Such a deviation
would indicate the Dirac $\nu_e$ nature and the presence of time reversal symmetry violation (TRSV)
interactions. In the second case the azimuthal asymmetries, polar distribution and energy spectrum
of scattered electrons are sensitive to the interference terms between the standard and exotic
interactions, proportional to the various angular correlations. Our model-independent study
is carried out for the flavour $\nu_e$ eigenstates in the relativistic $\nu_e$ limit.
