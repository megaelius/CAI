In this paper, we calculated the CP-averaged branching ratios and the CP-violating asymmetries
of the twenty one $\bar{B}^0_s \to PV $ decays ( here $P=(\pi,K, \eta, \eta^\prime)$ and $V=(\rho,
K^*, \phi, \omega)$ ) by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach. Besides
the full leading-order (LO) contributions, all the next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions
currently known are taken into account. We found numerically that: (a) the effects of the NLO contributions
to the considered decay modes are varying from channel to channel: some of them are large in magnitude
and could be tested by future experiments; (b) the NLO contributions can provide $\sim 40\%$ enhancement
to the LO PQCD predictions for ${\cal B}(\bar{B}_s^0 \to K^0 \bar{K}^{*0})$ and $ {\cal B}( \bar{B}_s^0
\to K^{\pm}K^{*\mp})$, or $\sim 37\% $ reduction to $ {\cal B}(\bar{B}_s^0 \to \pi^{-} K^{*+})$;
and we proved that the inclusion of the NLO contributions can improve significantly the agreement
between the theory and the experimental measurements; (c) the effects on the PQCD predictions due
to the inclusion of the NLO twist-2 and twist-3 contributions to the relevant form factors are generally
small: less than $ 10\%$ in magnitude; (d) for $\bar B_s^0\to K^+ \rho^- $ and $ \pi^0 K^{*0}$ decays,
the big difference between the PQCD predictions for their decay rates are induced by different topological
structure and by interference effects among the decay amplitude ${\cal A}_{T,C}$ and ${\cal A}_P$;
and (e) for $\bar{B}_s^0 \to V(\eta, \eta^\prime)$ decays, the complex pattern of the PQCD predictions
for their branching ratios can be understood by rather different topological structures and the
interference effects between the decay amplitude ${\cal A}(V\eta_q)$ and ${\cal A}(V\eta_s)$
due to the $\eta-\eta^\prime$ mixing.
