In this work, our prime focus is to study the one to one correspondence between the conduction phenomena
in electrical wires with impurity and the scattering events responsible for particle production
during stochastic inflation and reheating implemented under a closed quantum mechanical system
in early universe cosmology. In this connection, we also present a derivation of fourth order corrected
version of the Fokker Planck equation and its analytical solution for studying the dynamical features
of the particle creation events in the stochastic inflation and reheating stage of the universe.
It is explicitly shown from our computation that quantum corrected Fokker Planck equation describe
the particle creation phenomena better for Dirac delta type of scatterer. In this connection, we
additionally discuss It$\hat{o}$, Stratonovich prescription and the explicit role of finite
temperature effective potential for solving the probability distribution profile. Furthermore,
we extend our discussion to describe the quantum description of randomness involved in the dynamics.
We also present a computation to derive the expression for the measure of the stochastic non-linearity
arising in the stochastic inflation and reheating epoch of the universe, often described by Lyapunov
Exponent. Apart from that, we quantify the quantum chaos arising in a closed system by a more strong
measure, commonly known as Spectral Form Factor using the principles of Random Matrix Theory (RMT).
Additionally, we discuss the role of out of time order correlation (OTOC) function to describe quantum
chaos in the present non-equilibrium field theoretic setup. Finally, for completeness, we also
provide a bound on the measure of quantum chaos arising due to the presence of stochastic non-linear
dynamical interactions into the closed quantum system of the early universe in a completely model-independent
way.
