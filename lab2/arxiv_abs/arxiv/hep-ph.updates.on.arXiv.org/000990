We discuss the compatibility of the combined annual modulation effect measured by DAMA/LIBRA-phase1
and DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 with an explanation in terms of inelastic scattering events induced by the
most general Galilean-invariant effective contact interaction of a Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP) dark matter particle of spin 0, 1/2 or 1. We take into account all the possible interferences
among operators by studying the intersections among the ellipsoidal surfaces of constant signal
of DAMA and other experiments in the space of the coupling constants of the effective theory. In our
analysis we assume a standard Maxwellian velocity distribution in the Galaxy. We find that, compared
to the elastic case, inelastic scattering partially relieves but does not eliminate the existing
tension between the DAMA effect and the constraints from the null results of other experiments.
Such tension is very large in all the parameter space with the exception of a small region for WIMP
mass $m_{\chi}\simeq$ 10 GeV and mass splitting $\delta\gtrsim$ 20 keV, where it is partially,
but not completely relieved. In such region the bounds from fluorine targets are evaded in a kinematic
way because the minimal WIMP incoming speed required to trigger upscatters off fluorine exceeds
the maximal WIMP velocity in the Galaxy, or is very close to it. As a consequence, we also find that
the residual tension between DAMA and other results is more sensitive on the astrophysical parameters
compared to the elastic case. We find that the configurations with the smallest tension can produce
enough yearly modulation in some of the DAMA bins in compliance with the constraints from other experiments,
but the ensuing shape of the modulation spectrum is too steep compared to the measured one. For such
configurations the recent COSINE-100 bound is evaded in a natural way due to their large expected
modulation fractions.
