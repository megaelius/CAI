Well-motivated extensions of the standard model predict ultra-light and fundamental pseudo-scalar
particles (e.g., axions or axion-like particles: ALPs). Similarly to the Primakoff-effect for
axions, ALPs can mix with photons and consequently be searched for in laboratory experiments and
with astrophysical observations. Here, we search for energy-dependent modulations of high-energy
gamma-ray spectra that are tell-tale signatures of photon-ALPs mixing. To this end, we analyze
the data recorded with the Fermi -LAT from Galactic pulsars selected to have a line of sight crossing
spiral arms at a large pitch angle. The large-scale Galactic magnetic field traces the shape of spiral
arms, such that a sizable photon-ALP conversion probability is expected for the sources considered.
In nine years of Fermi -LAT data, we detect significant spectral features in the selected source-sample
consistent with photon-ALPs oscillation with a combined statistical significance of 5.52 {\sigma}
. Notably, sources with neighboring lines of sight share similar spectral features. From a common
fit to all sources, we determine the most-likely parameters for mass $m_{a}$ and coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$
to be $m_a=(3.6 \substack{+0.5_ \mathrm{stat.}\\-0.2_ \mathrm{stat.}}\pm 0.2_\mathrm{syst.}
)$ neV and $g_{a\gamma\gamma}=(2.3\substack{+0.3_ \mathrm{stat.}\\-0.4_ \mathrm{stat.}}\pm
0.4_\mathrm{syst.})\times 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$. In the error budget, we consider instrumental
effects, scaling of the adopted Galactic magnetic field model ($\pm~20~\%$), and uncertainties
on the distance of individual sources. We note that an astrophysical interpretation of the detected
modulation is not obvious.
