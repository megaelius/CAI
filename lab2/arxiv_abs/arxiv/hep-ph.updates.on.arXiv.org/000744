We present a lattice calculation of the leading Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution
of the light $u$- and $d$-quarks to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(ud)$,
adopting the gauge configurations generated by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC)
with $N_f = 2+1+1$ dynamical quarks at three values of the lattice spacing ($a \simeq 0.062, 0.082,
0.089$ fm) with pion masses in the range $M_\pi \simeq 210 - 450$ MeV. Thanks to the ETMC setup we perform
a careful investigation of finite-volume effects (FVEs), which represent one of main source of
uncertainty in modern lattice calculations of $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(ud)$. In order to remove FVEs we
develop an analytic representation of the vector correlator, which describes the lattice data
for time distances larger than $\simeq 0.2$ fm. The representation is based on quark-hadron duality
at small and intermediate time distances and on the two-pion contributions in a finite box at larger
time distances. After removing FVEs we extrapolate the corrected lattice data to the physical pion
point and to the continuum limit taking into account the chiral logs predicted by Chiral Perturbation
Theory (ChPT). We obtain $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(ud) = 619.4 ~ (16.6) \cdot 10^{-10}$. Adding the contribution
of strange and charm quarks, obtained by ETMC, and an estimate of the isospin-breaking corrections
and quark-disconnected diagrams from the literature we get $a_\mu^{\rm HVP}(udsc) = 683 ~ (18)
\cdot 10^{-10}$, which is consistent with recent results based on dispersive analyses of the experimental
cross section data for $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadrons. Using our analytic representation
of the vector correlator we provide also the first eleven moments of the polarization function and
we compare them with recent results of the dispersive analysis of the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ channels.
