We derive expressions for the cross section of the multiparton interactions based on the analysis
of the relevant Feynman diagrams. We express the cross sections through the double (triple, ...)
generalized parton distributions (GPDs). In the mean field approximation for the double GPDs the
answer is expressed through the integral over two gluon form factor which was measured in the exclusive
DIS vector meson production.We explain under what conditions the derived expressions correspond
to an intuitive picture of hard interactions in the impact parameter representation. The mean field
approximation in which correlations of the partons are neglected fail to explain the data, while
pQCD induced correlation enhance large $p_\perp$ and $ 0.001 < x < 0.1$ typically enhance the cross
section by a factor of 1.5 -- 2 explaining the current data. We argue that in the small x kinematics
($10^{-4} \le x \le 10^{-3}$) where effects of perturbative correlations diminish, the nonperturbative
mechanism kicks in and generates positive correlations comparable in magnitude with the perturbative
ones. We explain how our technique can be used for calculations of MPI in the proton - nucleus scattering.
The interplay of hard interactions and underlying event is discussed, as well as different geometric
pictures for each of MPI mechanisms-pQCD, nonperturbative correlations and mean field. Predictions
for value of \effs for various processes and a wide range of kinematics are given. We show that together
different MPI mechanisms give good description of experimental data, both at Tvatron, and LHC,
including the central kinematics studied by ATLAS and CMS detectors, and forward (heavy flavors)
kinematics studied by LHCb.
