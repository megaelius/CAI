The valence double parton distribution of the pion is analyzed in the framework of chiral quark models,
where in the chiral limit factorization between the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom
occurs. This feature leads, at the quark-model scale, to a particularly simple distribution of
the form $D(x_1,x_2, \vec{q}) = \delta(1-x_1-x_2) F(\vec{q})$, where $x_{1,2}$ are the longitudinal
momentum fractions carried the valence quark and antiquark and $\vec{q}$ is their relative transverse
momentum. For $\vec{q}=\vec{0}$ this result complies immediately to the Gaunt-Sterling sum rules.
The DGLAP evolution to higher scales is carried out in terms of the Mellin moments. We then explore
its role on the longitudinal correlation quantified with the ratio of the double distribution to
the product of single distributions, $D(x_1,x_2, \vec{q}=\vec{0})/D(x_1)D(x_2)$. We point
out that the ratios of moments $\langle x_1^n x_2^m \rangle / \langle x_1^n \rangle \langle x_2^m
\rangle $ are independent of the evolution, providing particularly suitable measures to be tested
in the upcoming lattice simulations. The transverse form factor $F(\vec{q})$ and its Fourier conjugate
in the relative transverse coordinate $\vec{b}$ are obtained in variants of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
model with the spectral and Pauli-Villars regularizations.The results are valid in the soft-momentum
domain. Interestingly, with the spectral regularization of the model, the effective cross section
for the double parton scattering of pions is exactly equal to the geometric cross section, $\sigma_{\rm
eff}=\pi \langle \vec{b}^2 \rangle$ and yields about 20~mb.
