We review the spin equations for the muon in the 1.45~T muon storage ring at Brookhaven National Laboratory,
which has subsequently been relocated to Fermilab. Muons are stored in a uniform 1.45~T magnetic
field, and vertical focusing is provided by four sets of electrostatic quadrupoles placed symmetrically
around the storage ring. The storage ring is operated at the "magic $\gamma = 29.3$" so that the effect
of the motional magnetic field cancels for muons at the magic momentum. We point out the relative
sizes of the various terms in the spin equations, and show that for experiments that use the magic
$\gamma$ and electric quadrupole focusing to store the muon beam, any proposed effect that multiplies
either the motional magnetic field $\vec \beta \times \vec E$ or the muon pitching motion $\vec \beta
\cdot \vec B$ term, will be smaller by three or more orders of magnitude, relative to the spin precession
from the storage ring magnetic field. We use a recently proposed General Relativity correction
as an example, to demonstrate the smallness of any such contribution, and point out that the revised
preprint from these authors still contains a conceptual error, that significantly overestimates
the magnitude of their proposed correction. We have prepared this document in the hope that future
authors will find it useful, should they wish to propose corrections from some additional term added
to the Thomas equation, Eq. 13, below. Our goal is to clarify how the experiment is done, and how the
small corrections due to the presence of the radial electric field and the vertical pitching motion
of themuons (betatron motion) in the storage ring are taken into account.
