We examined the effects of the weak magnetic field on the dissociation of heavy quarkonia immersed
in a thermal medium of quarks and gluons. For that purpose, we have revisited the general structure
of gluon self-energy tensor in the presence of a weak magnetic field in thermal medium and obtained
the relevant structure functions. The structure functions give the real and imaginary parts of
the resummed gluon propagator, which further give the respective dielectric permittivities.
The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity will be used to evaluate the real and
imaginary parts of the complex heavy quark potential. The real-part of the potential is found to
be more screened, whereas the magnitude of the imaginary-part of the potential gets increased on
increasing the value of both temperature and magnetic field. In addition to this, we have observed
that the real-part gets slightly more screened while the imaginary part gets increased in the presence
of a weak magnetic field as compared to their counterparts in the absence of a magnetic field. The
increase in the screening of the real-part of the potential leads to the decrease of binding energies
of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$, whereas the increase in the magnitude of the imaginary part leads to
the increase of thermal width with the temperature and magnetic field both. Also the binding energy
and thermal width in the presence of weak magnetic field become smaller and larger, respectively,
as compared to that in the pure thermal case. We have finally obtained the dissociation temperatures
for $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$, which become slightly lower in the presence of weak magnetic field.
This observation leads to the slightly early dissociation of quarkonia because of the presence
of a weak magnetic field.
