The study of dense matter at ultra-high density has a very long history, which is meaningful for us
to understand not only cosmic events in extreme circumstances but also fundamental laws of physics.
It is well known that the state of cold matter at supra-nuclear density depends on the non-perturbative
nature of quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD) and is essential for modeling pulsars. A so-called H-cluster
matter is proposed in this paper as the nature of dense matter in reality. In compact stars at only
a few nuclear densities but low temperature, quarks could be interacting strongly with each other
there. That might render quarks grouped in clusters, although the hypothetical quark-clusters
in cold dense matter has not been confirmed due to the lack of both theoretical and experimental evidence.
Motivated by recent lattice QCD simulations of the H-dibaryons (with structure uuddss), we are
therefore considering here a possible kind of quark-clusters, H-clusters, that could emerge inside
compact stars during their initial cooling, as the dominant components inside (the degree of freedom
could then be H-clusters there).Taking into account the in-medium stiffening effect, we find that
at baryon densities of compact stars $H$-cluster matter could be more stable than nuclear matter.
We also find that for the H-cluster matter with lattice structure, the equation of state could be
so stiff that it would seem to be "superluminal" in most dense region. However, the real sound speed
for H-cluster matter is in fact hard to calculate, so at this stage we do not put constraints on our
model from the usual requirment of causality.
