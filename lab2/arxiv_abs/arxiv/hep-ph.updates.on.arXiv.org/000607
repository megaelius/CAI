The appealing feature of inverse seesaw models is that the Standard Model (SM) neutrino mass emerges
from the exchange of TeV scale singlets with sizable Yukawa couplings, which can be tested at colliders.
However, the tiny Majorana mass splitting between TeV singlets, introduced to accommodate small
neutrino masses, is left unexplained. Moreover, we argue that these models suffer from a structural
limitation that prevents a successful leptogenesis if one insists on having unsuppressed Yukawa
couplings and TeV scale singlets. In this work we propose a hybrid seesaw model, where we replace
the mass splitting with a coupling to a high scale seesaw module including a TeV scalar. We show that
this structure achieves the goal of filling both the above gaps with couplings of order unity. The
necessary structure automatically arises embedding the seesaw mechanism in composite Higgs models,
but may also be enforced by new gauge symmetries in a weakly-coupled theory. Our hybrid seesaw models
have distinguishing features compared to the standard high scale type-I seesaw and inverse seesaw.
Firstly, they have much richer phenomenology. Indeed, they generally predict new TeV scale physics
(including scalars) potentially accessible at present and future colliders, whereas weakly-coupled
versions may also have astrophysical and cosmological signatures due to the presence of a light
Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to neutrinos. Secondly, our scenario features an interesting interplay
between high scale and TeV scale physics in leptogenesis and enlarges the range of allowed high scale
singlet masses beyond the usual $\sim 10^9-10^{ 15 }$ GeV, without large hierarchies in the Yukawa
couplings nor small mass splitting among the singlets.
