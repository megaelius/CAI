The two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) is the most minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) containing
extra Higgs doublet fields. Given the multiplicity of Higgs states in a 2HDM, its Higgs potential
is significantly more involved than the SM one. Importantly, it contains a multitude of Higgs triple
self-couplings, unlike the SM, which only has one. These interactions are key to understanding
the phenomenology of the 2HDM, as they uniquely determine the form of the potential. Several studies
analysing the prospects of measuring these couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have found
them to be quite low generally. However, such studies have largely concentrated on Higgs pair-production
induced by gluon-gluon scattering, either via direct annihilation or followed by their splitting
into $b$-(anti)quark pairs, which in turn annihilate leaving behind spectator $b$-(anti)quarks.
Both of these channels are therefore governed by QCD dynamics. We compare here the yields of such
channels to those initiated by (primarily) valence quarks, which involve Electro-Weak (EW) interactions
only, for neutral multi-Higgs final states. We find that EW production can be dominant over QCD production
for certain final state combinations. We also illustrate that charged final states, which can only
be produced via EW modes, could serve as important probes of some $H^\pm$ triple couplings, that
are inaccessible in QCD-induced processes, during Run 2 and 3 of the LHC. Our analysis covers regions
of the parameter space of the Type-I 2HDM that have escaped the most up-to-date experimental constraints
coming from EW precision data, LHC measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs boson properties, searches
for additional Higgs states, and flavour physics.
