The cores of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been suggested as the sources of IceCube neutrinos,
and recent numerical simulations have indicated that hot AGN coronae of Seyfert galaxies and radiatively
inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) of low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) may be promising sites of
ion acceleration. We present detailed studies on detection prospects of high-energy multi-messenger
emissions from RIAFs in nearby LLAGNs. We construct a model of RIAFs that can reproduce the observational
features of the current X-ray observations of nearby LLAGNs. We then calculate the high-energy
particle emissions from nearby individual LLAGNs, including MeV gamma rays from thermal electrons,
TeV--PeV neutrinos produced by non-thermal protons, and sub-GeV to sub-TeV gamma rays from proton-induced
electromagnetic cascades. We find that, although these are beyond the reach of current facilities,
proposed future experiments such as e-ASTROGAM and IceCube-Gen2 should be able to detect the MeV
gamma rays and the neutrinos, respectively, or else they can place meaningful constraints on the
parameter space of the model. On the other hand, the detection of high-energy gamma rays due to the
electromagnetic cascades will be challenging with the current and near-future experiments, such
as Fermi and Cherenkov Telescope Array. In an accompanying paper, we demonstrate that LLAGNs can
be a source of the diffuse soft gamma-ray and TeV--PeV neutrino backgrounds, whereas in the present
paper, we focus on the prospects for multi-messenger tests which can be applied to reveal the nature
of the high-energy neutrinos and photons from LLAGNs.
