The strangeonium-like $s\bar{s}g$ hybrids are investigated from lattice QCD in the quenched approximation.
In the Coulomb gauge, spatially extended operators are constructed for $1^{--}$ and $(0,1,2)^{-+}$
states with the color octet $s\bar{s}$ component being separated from the chromomagnetic field
strength by spatial distances $r$, whose matrix elements between the vacuum and the corresponding
states are interpreted as Bethe-Salpeter (BS) wave functions. In each of the $(1,2)^{-+}$ channels,
the masses and the BS wave functions are reliably derived. The $1^{-+}$ ground state mass is around
2.1-2.2 GeV, and that of $2^{-+}$ is around 2.3-2.4 GeV, while the masses of the first excited states
are roughly 1.4 GeV higher. This mass splitting is much larger than the expectation of the phenomenological
flux-tube model or constituent gluon model for hybrids, which is usually a few hundred MeV. The BS
wave functions with respect to $r$ show clear radial nodal structures of non-relativistic two-body
system, which imply that $r$ is a meaningful dynamical variable for these hybrids and motivate a
color halo picture of hybrids that the color octet $s\bar{s}$ is surrounded by gluonic degrees of
freedom. In the $1^{--}$ channel, the properties of the lowest two states comply with those of $\phi(1020)$
and $\phi(1680)$. We have not obtained convincing information relevant to $\phi(2170)$ yet, however,
we argue that whether $\phi(2170)$ is a conventional $s\bar{s}$ meson or a $s\bar{s}g$ hybrid within
the color halo scenario, the ratio of partial decay widths $\Gamma(\phi \eta)$ and $\Gamma (\phi
\eta')$ observed by BESIII can be understood by the mechanism of hadronic transition of a strangeonium-like
meson along with the $\eta-\eta'$ mixing.
