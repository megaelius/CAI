Neutron stars serve as excellent next-generation thermal detectors of dark matter, heated by the
scattering and annihilation of dark matter accelerated to relativistic speeds in their deep gravitational
wells. However, the dynamics of neutron star cores are uncertain, making it difficult at present
to unequivocally compute dark matter scattering in this region. On the other hand, the physics of
an outer layer of the neutron star, the crust, is more robustly understood. We show that dark matter
scattering solely with the low-density crust still kinetically heats neutron stars to infrared
temperatures detectable by forthcoming telescopes. We find that for both spin-independent and
spin-dependent scattering on nucleons, the crust-only cross section sensitivity is $10^{-43}
- 10^{-41}$~cm$^2$ for dark matter masses of 100 MeV $-$ 1 PeV, with the best sensitivity arising
from dark matter scattering with a crust constituent called nuclear pasta (including gnocchi,
spaghetti, and lasagna phases). For dark matter masses from 10 eV to 1 MeV, the sensitivity is $10^{-39}
- 10^{-34}$~cm$^2$, arising from exciting collective phonon modes in a neutron superfluid in the
inner crust. Furthermore, for any $s$-wave or $p$-wave annihilating dark matter, we show that dark
matter will efficiently annihilate by thermalizing just with the neutron star crust, regardless
of whether the dark matter ever scatters with the neutron star core. This implies efficient annihilation
in neutron stars for any electroweakly interacting dark matter with inelastic mass splittings
of up to 200 MeV, including Higgsinos. We conclude that neutron star crusts play a key role in dark
matter scattering and annihilation in neutron stars.
