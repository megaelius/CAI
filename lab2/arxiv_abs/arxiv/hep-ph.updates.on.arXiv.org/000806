It is widely accepted that dark matter contributes about a quarter of the critical mass-energy density
in our Universe. The nature of dark matter is currently unknown, with the mass of possible constituents
spanning nearly one hundred orders of magnitude. The ultralight scalar field dark matter, consisting
of extremely light bosons with $m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV and often called "fuzzy" dark matter, provides
intriguing solutions to some challenges at sub-Galactic scales for the standard cold dark matter
model. As shown by Khmelnitsky and Rubakov, such a scalar field in the Galaxy would produce an oscillating
gravitational potential with nanohertz frequencies, resulting in periodic variations in the
times of arrival of radio pulses from pulsars. The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) has been monitoring
20 millisecond pulsars at two to three weeks intervals for more than a decade. In addition to the detection
of nanohertz gravitational waves, PPTA offers the opportunity for direct searches for fuzzy dark
matter in an astrophysically feasible range of masses. We analyze the latest PPTA data set which
includes timing observations for 26 pulsars made between 2004 and 2016. We perform a search in this
data set for evidence of ultralight dark matter in the Galaxy using Bayesian and Frequentist methods.
No statistically significant detection has been made. We therefore place upper limits on the local
dark matter density. Our limits, improving on previous searches by a factor of two to five, constrain
the dark matter density of ultralight bosons with $m \leq 10^{-23}$ eV to be below $6\,\text{GeV}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$
with 95\% confidence in the Earth neighborhood. Finally, we discuss the prospect of probing the
astrophysically favored mass range $m \gtrsim 10^{-22}$ eV with next-generation pulsar timing
facilities.
