We apply on-shell methods to the bottom-up construction of electroweak amplitudes, allowing for
both renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions. We use the little-group covariant
massive-spinor formalism, and flesh out some of its details along the way. Thanks to the compact
form of the resulting amplitudes, many of their properties, and in particular the constraints of
perturbative unitarity, are easily seen in this formalism. Our approach is purely bottom-up, assuming
just the standard-model electroweak spectrum as well as the conservation of electric charge and
fermion number. The most general massive three-point amplitudes consistent with these symmetries
are derived and studied in detail, as the primary building blocks for the construction of scattering
amplitudes. We employ a simple argument, based on tree-level unitarity of four-point amplitudes,
to identify the three-point amplitudes that are non-renormalizable at tree level. This bottom-up
analysis remarkably reproduces many low-energy relations implied by electroweak symmetry through
the standard-model Higgs mechanism and beyond it. We then discuss four-point amplitudes. The gluing
of three-point amplitudes into four-point amplitudes in the massive spinor helicity formalism
is clarified. As an example, we work out the $\psic\psi Zh$ amplitude, including also the non-factorizable
part. The latter is an all-order expression in the effective-field-theory expansion. Further
constraints on the couplings are obtained by requiring perturbative unitarity. In the $\psic\psi
Zh$ example, one for instance obtains the renormalizable-level relations between vector and fermion
masses and gauge and Yukawa couplings. We supplement our bottom-up derivations with a matching
of three- and four-point amplitude coefficients onto the standard-model effective field theory
(SMEFT) in the broken electroweak phase.
