Towards experimental confirmations of the type-I seesaw mechanism, we explore a prospect of discovering
the heavy Majorana right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) from a resonant production of a new massive gauge
boson ($Z^{\prime}$) and its subsequent decay into a pair of RHNs ($Z^{\prime}\to NN$) at the future
LHC. Recent simulation studies have shown that the discovery of the RHNs through this process is
promising in the future. However, the current LHC data very severely constrains the production
cross section of the $Z^{\prime}$ boson into a dilepton final states, $pp \to Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}
$ ($\ell=e$ or $\mu$). Extrapolating the current bound to the future, we find that a significant
enhancement of the branching ratio ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN$) over ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to
\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$) is necessary for the future discovery of RHNs. As a well-motivated simple extension
of the Standard Model (SM) to incorporate the $Z^\prime$ boson and the type-I seesaw mechanism,
we consider the minimal U(1)$_X$ model. We point out that this model can yield a significant enhancement
up to ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN)/{\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}) \simeq 5$ (per generation).
This is in sharp contrast with the minimal $B-L$ model, a benchmark scenario commonly used in simulation
studies, which predicts ${\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to NN)/{\rm BR}(Z^{\prime}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-})
\simeq 0.5$ (per generation). With such an enhancement and a realistic model-parameter choice
to reproduce the neutrino oscillation data, we conclude that the possibility of discovering RHNs
with a $300 \; {\rm fb}^{-1}$ luminosity implies that the $Z^\prime$ boson will be discovered with
a luminosity of $170.5 \;{\rm fb}^{-1}$ ($125 \; {\rm fb}^{-1}$) for the normal (inverted) hierarchy
of the light neutrino mass pattern.
