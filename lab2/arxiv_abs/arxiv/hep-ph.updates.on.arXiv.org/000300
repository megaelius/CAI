We present the minimal model of electroweak baryogenesis induced by fermions. The model consists
of an extension of the Standard Model with one electroweak singlet fermion and one pair of vector
like doublet fermions with renormalizable couplings to the Higgs. A strong first order phase transition
is radiatively induced by the singlet-doublet fermions, while the origin of the baryon asymmetry
is due to asymmetric reflection of the same set of fermions on the expanding electroweak bubble wall.
The singlet-doublet fermions are stabilized at the electroweak scale by chiral symmetries and
the Higgs potential is stabilized by threshold corrections coming from a multi-TeV ultraviolet
completion which does not play any significant role in the phase transition. We work in terms of background
symmetry invariants and perform an analytic semiclassical calculation of the baryon asymmetry,
showing that the model may effectively generate the observed baryon asymmetry for percent level
values of the unique invariant CP violating phase of the singlet-doublet sector. We include a detailed
study of electron electric dipole moment and electroweak precision limits, and for one typical
benchmark scenario we also recast existing collider constraints, showing that the model is consistent
with all current experimental data. We point out that fermion induced electroweak baryogenesis
has irreducible phenomenology at the $13 \, \textrm{TeV}$ LHC since the new fermions must be at the
electroweak scale, have electroweak quantum numbers and couple strongly with the Higgs. The most
promising searches involve topologies with multiple leptons and missing energy in the final state.
