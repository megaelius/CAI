The equation of state $p(\epsilon)$ and speed of sound squared $c_s^2$ are studied in grand canonical
ensemble of all hadron resonances having masses $\leq 2\,$GeV. This large ensemble is divided into
strange and non-strange hadron resonances and furthermore to pionic, bosonic and femionic sectors.
It is found that the pions represent the main contributors to $c_s^2$ and other thermodynamic quantities
including the equation of state $p(\epsilon)$ at low temperatures. At high temperatures, the main
contributions are added in by the massive hadron resonances. The speed of sound squared can be calculated
from the derivative of pressure with respect to the energy density, $\partial p/\partial \epsilon$,
or from the entropy-specific heat ratio, $s/c_v$. It is concluded that the physics of these two expressions
is not necessarily identical. They are distinguishable below and above the critical temperature
$T_c$. This behavior is observed at vanishing and finite chemical potential. At high temperatures,
both expressions get very close to each other and both of them approach the asymptotic value, $1/3$.
In the HRG results, which are only valid below $T_c$, the difference decreases with increasing the
temperature and almost vanishes near $T_c$. It is concluded that the HRG model can very well reproduce
the results of the lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of $\partial p/\partial \epsilon$ and
$s/c_v$, especially at finite chemical potential. In light of this, energy fluctuations and other
collective phenomena associated with the specific heat might be present in the HRG model. At fixed
temperatures, it is found that $c_s^2$ is not sensitive to the chemical potential.
