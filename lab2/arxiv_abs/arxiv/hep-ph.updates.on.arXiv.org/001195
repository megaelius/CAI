The mass and coupling of the axial-vector tetraquark $T_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{d} }^{0}$ are calculated
by means of the QCD two-point sum rule method. In computations we take into account contributions
arising from various quark, gluon and mixed vacuum condensates up to dimension 10. The central value
of the mass $m=(7105 \pm 155)~\mathrm{MeV}$ lies below the thresholds for the strong and electromagnetic
decays of $T_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{d}}^{0}$ state, and hence it transforms to conventional mesons
only through the weak decays. In the case of upper value $m=7260~\mathrm{MeV}$ the tetraquark $T_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{d}}^{0}$
becomes the strong- and electromagnetic-interaction unstable particle. In the first case we estimate
the full width and mean lifetime of $T_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{d}}^{0}$ using its dominant semileptonic
decays $T_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{d}}^{0}\rightarrow T_{cc;\bar{u}\bar{d}}^{+}l \overline{\nu
}_{l}$ ($l=e,\ \mu, \tau$), where the final-state tetraquark is a scalar state. In the context of
the second scenario we calculate partial widths of $S$-wave strong decays $T_{bc}^{0}\to B^{\ast
-}D^{+}$ and $T_{bc}^{0}\rightarrow \overline{B^{\ast }}D^{0}$, and using these channels evaluate
the full width of $T_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{d}}^{0}$. Predictions for the full width $\Gamma=(3.3\pm
0.5)\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{MeV}$ and mean lifetime $\tau=1.99_{-0.26}^{+0.36}~\mathrm{ps}$
of $T_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{d} }^{0}$ obtained in the context of the first option, as well as the full
width $\Gamma=(63.5\pm 8.9)~\mathrm{MeV}$ extracted in the second scenario may be useful for
experimental and theoretical exploration of double-heavy exotic mesons.
