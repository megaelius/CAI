We investigate probing the hot and dense nuclear matter with strange vector mesons ($K^*, \bar{K}^*$).
Our analysis is based on PHSD which incorporates partonic and hadronic dof and describes the full
dynamics of HICs. This allows to study the $K^*$ and $\bar{K}^*$ meson formation from the QGP and
the in-medium effects related to the modification of their properties during the propagation in
dense and hot matter. We employ relativistic Breit-Wigner spectral functions for the $K^*,\bar{K}^*$
mesons with self-energies obtained from a G-matrix approach to study the role of in-medium effects
on the $K^*$ and $\bar{K}^*$ meson dynamics in HIC from FAIR/NICA to LHC energies. According to our
analysis most of the final $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s, that can be observed experimentally, are produced
during the late hadronic phase and stem dominantly from the $K (\bar{K}) + \pi \to K^*(\bar{K}^*)$
formation channel. The amount of $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s originating from the QGP channel is comparatively
small even at LHC energies and such $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s can hardly be reconstructed experimentally
due to the rescattering of final pions and (anti-)kaons. This mirrors the results from our previous
study on the strange vector-meson production in HICs at RHIC energies. The influence of the in-medium
effects on the dynamics of the $K^*/\bar{K}^*$ is rather small since they are mostly produced at
low baryon densities. Additional cuts on the shape of the observed signal and the range of the invariant
mass region of the $K^*/\bar{K}^*$ also affect the final spectra. We demonstrate that the $K^*/\bar{K}^*$
in-medium effects are more visible at lower beam energy, e.g. FAIR/NICA and BES RHIC energies, where
the production of $K^*/\bar{K}^*$s occurs at larger baryon densities. Finally, we present the
experimental procedures to extract information on the in-medium masses and widths by fitting final
mass spectra at LHC energies.
