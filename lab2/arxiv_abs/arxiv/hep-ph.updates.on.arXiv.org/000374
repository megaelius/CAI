Jet substructure techniques are playing an essential role in exploring the TeV scale at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), since they facilitate the efficient reconstruction and identification
of highly-boosted objects. Both for the LHC and for future colliders, there is a growing interest
in using jet substructure methods based only on charged-particle information. The reason is that
silicon-based tracking detectors offer excellent granularity and precise vertexing, which can
improve the angular resolution on highly-collimated jets and mitigate the impact of pileup. In
this paper, we assess how much jet substructure performance degrades by using track-only information,
and we demonstrate physics contexts in which calorimetry is most beneficial. Specifically, we
consider five different hadronic final states - W bosons, Z bosons, top quarks, light quarks, gluons
- and test the pairwise discrimination power with a multi-variate combination of substructure
observables. In the idealized case of perfect reconstruction, we quantify the loss in discrimination
performance when using just charged particles compared to using all detected particles. We also
consider the intermediate case of using charged particles plus photons, which provides valuable
information about neutral pions. In the more realistic case of a segmented calorimeter, we assess
the potential performance gains from improving calorimeter granularity and resolution, comparing
a CMS-like detector to more ambitious future detector concepts. Broadly speaking, we find large
performance gains from neutral-particle information and from improved calorimetry in cases where
jet mass resolution drives the discrimination power, whereas the gains are more modest if an absolute
mass scale calibration is not required.
