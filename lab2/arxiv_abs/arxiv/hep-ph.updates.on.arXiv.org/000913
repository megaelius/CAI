There exist two methods to study two-baryon systems in lattice QCD: the direct method which extracts
eigenenergies from the plateaux of the temporal correlator and the HAL QCD method which extracts
observables from the non-local potential associated with the tempo-spatial correlator. Although
the two methods should give the same results theoretically, qualitatively different results have
been reported. Recently, we pointed out that the separation of the ground state from the excited
states is crucial to obtain sensible results in the former, while both states provide useful signals
in the latter. In this paper, we identify the contribution of each state in the direct method by decomposing
the two-baryon correlators into the finite-volume eigenmodes obtained from the HAL QCD method.
We consider the $\Xi\Xi$ system in the $^1$S$_0$ channel at $m_\pi = 0.51$ GeV in 2+1 flavor lattice
QCD using the wall and smeared quark sources. We demonstrate that the "pseudo-plateau" at early
time slices (t = 1~2 fm) from the smeared source in the direct method indeed originates from the contamination
of the excited states, and the true plateau with the ground state saturation is realized only at t
> 5~15 fm corresponding to the inverse of the lowest excitation energy. We also demonstrate that
the two-baryon operator can be optimized by utilizing the finite-volume eigenmodes, so that (i)
the finite-volume energy spectra from the HAL QCD method agree with those from the optimized temporal
correlator and (ii) the correct spectra would be accessed in the direct method only if highly optimized
operators are employed. Thus we conclude that the long-standing issue on the consistency between
the L\"uscher's finite volume method and the HAL QCD method for two baryons is now resolved: They
are consistent with each other quantitatively only if the excited contamination is properly removed
in the former.
