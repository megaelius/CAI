We investigate the possibility that GW170817 has not been the merger of two conventional neutron
stars (NS) but that at least one of them was a hybrid star with a quark matter core, possibly belonging
to a third family of compact stars. We present a Bayesian analysis method for selecting the most probable
equation of state (EoS) under a set of constraints, which include besides the maximum mass also the
tidal deformability from GW170817 and the first mass and radius measurement by the NICER Collaboration
for PSR J0030+0451. We apply this method for the first time to a two-parameter family of hybrid EoS
based on the DD2 model with nucleonic excluded volume for hadronic matter and the color superconducting
generalized nlNJL model for quark matter. The model has a variable onset density for deconfinement
and can mimic effects of pasta phases with the possibility of producing a third family of hybrid stars
in the mass-radius ($M-R$) diagram. The main findings of this study are that: 1) the presence of multiple
configurations for a given mass corresponds to a set of disconnected lines in the $\Lambda_1-\Lambda_2$
diagram of tidal deformabilities for binary mergers, so that merger events from the same mass range
may result in a probability landscape with different peak positions; 2) the Bayesian analysis with
the above observational constraints favors an early onset of the deconfinement transition, at
masses of $M_{\rm onset}\approx 0.5~M_\odot$ with a $M-R$ relationship that in the range of observed
neutron star masses is almost indistinguishable from that of a soft hadronic APR EoS; 3) a yet fictitious
measurement of the NICER experiment with a $1\sigma$ range that is half of the present value and a
larger mass (within the present $1\sigma$ range) would change the posterior likelihood so that
a phase transition onset at $M_{\rm onset} = 1.6~M_\odot $ would be favored.
