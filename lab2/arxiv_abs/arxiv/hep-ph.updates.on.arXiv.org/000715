We give here an overview of recent developments in high energy physics and cosmology and their interconnections
that relate to unification, and discuss prospects for the future. Thus there are currently three
empirical data that point to supersymmetry as an underlying symmetry of particle physics: the unification
of gauge couplings within supersymmetry, the fact that nature respects the supersymmetry prediction
that the Higgs boson mass lie below 130 GeV, and vacuum stability up to the Planck scale with a Higgs
boson mass at $\sim 125$ GeV while the standard model does not do that. Coupled with the fact that supersymmetry
solves the big hierarchy problem related to the quadratic divergence to the Higgs boson mass square
along with the fact that there is no alternative paradigm that allows us to extrapolate physics from
the electroweak scale to the grand unification scale consistent with experiment, supersymmetry
remains a compelling framework for new physics beyond the standard model. The large loop correction
to the Higgs boson mass in supersymmetry to lift the tree mass to the experimentally observable value,
indicates a larger value of the scale of weak scale supersymmetry, making the observation of sparticles
more challenging but still within reach at the LHC for the lightest ones. Recent analyses show that
a high energy LHC (HE-LHC) operating at 27 TeV running at its optimal luminosity of $2.5 \times 10^{35}$
cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ can reduce the discovery period by several years relative to HL-LHC and significantly
extend the reach in parameter space of models. In the coming years several experiments related to
neutrino physics, searches for supersymmetry, on dark matter and dark energy will have direct impact
on the unification frontier.
