Conventionally invariant mass or transverse momentum techniques have been used to probe for any
formation of some exotic or unusual resonance states in high energy collision. There have also been
extensive study of dilepton production since the study of lepton pair generation in Drell-Yan processes
is immensely important as these processes enable us to validate the Standard Model-SM predictions
for the fundamental particles interaction at the new energy region and also to probe for new physics
beyond SM. In this work, we have applied symmetry scaling based complex network approach to study
exotic resonance/hadronic states utilizing the clustering coefficients and associated scaling
parameter extracted with the complex network based technique of Visibility Graph. We have analyzed
both the data of Pb-Pb collision data sample at 2.76 TeV from ALICE Collaboration and p-p collision
data at 8 TeV from CMS collaboration and analyzed how the patterns of symmetry scaling, scale-freeness
and correlation and clustering among the produced particles are are changing from p-p collision
to heavy ion one. This chaos-based complex network technique where simple parameters like Average
Clustering Coefficient and Power of Scale-freeness of Visibility Graph may hint at formation of
some exotic or unusual resonance states without using conventional methods. From this experiment
we may infer that higher range of Average clustering coefficient, might be the resonance states
from where the hadronic decay might have occurred and few clusters with highest value of this parameter
may indicate that those few clusters might have been ancestors of some strange particles.
