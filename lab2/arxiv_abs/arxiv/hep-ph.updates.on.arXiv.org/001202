We present new results on the calculation of the dark matter relic abundance within the Higgs induced
right-handed neutrino mixing model, solving density matrix equation. For a benchmark value of
the dark matter mass $M_{\rm DM} = 220\,{\rm TeV}$, we show the evolution of the abundance and how
this depends on reheat temperature, dark matter lifetime and source right-handed neutrino mass
$M_{\rm S}$, with the assumption $M_{\rm S} < M_{\rm DM}$. We compare the results with those obtained
within the Landau-Zener approximation showing that the latter largely overestimates the final
dark matter abundance. However, we also notice that since in the density matrix formalism the production
is non-resonant, this allows source right-handed neutrino masses below the W boson mass, making
dark matter more stable at large values of its mass and this still allows an allowed region in the case
of initial vanishing source right-handed neutrino abundance. For example, for $M_{\rm S} \gtrsim
1\,{\rm GeV}$, we find $M_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 20\,{\rm PeV}$. Otherwise, for $M_{\rm S} > M_W \sim 100\,{\rm
GeV}$, one has to assume a thermalisation of the source right-handed neutrinos prior to the freeze-in
of the dark matter abundance. In this case one has a large allowed range for the dark matter mass, depending
on $M_{\rm S}$. For example, imposing $M_{\rm S} \gtrsim 300\,{\rm GeV}$, allowing also successful
leptogenesis from decays, we find $500 \,{\rm GeV }\lesssim M_{\rm DM} \lesssim 0.5 \,{\rm PeV}$.
We also comment on how an initial thermal source right-handed neutrino abundance can be justified
and notice that our results suggest that also the interesting case $M_{\rm DM} < M_{\rm S}$, embaddable
in usual high scale two right-handed neutrino seesaw models, might be viable.
