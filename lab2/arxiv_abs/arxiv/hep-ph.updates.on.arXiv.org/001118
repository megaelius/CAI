Extensions of the Standard Model featuring a warped extra dimension compactified on an $S^1/Z_2$
orbifold, in which the fermions and gauge bosons live in the bulk of the fifth dimension, offer one
of the most compelling mechanisms for addressing both the hierarchy problem and the flavor puzzle
of the Standard Model. However, the five-dimensional mass terms of bulk fermions must be odd functions
on the orbifold, and as such they should be described by a field depending on the coordinate of the
extra dimension. We demonstrate the feasibility of dynamically generating these fermion bulk
masses with a bulk scalar field in warped extra dimensions. The bulk scalar acquires a vacuum expectation
value, which is odd under the orbifold symmetry and gives rise to the fermion bulk masses through
Yukawa-like interactions. Like in the conventional Randall-Sundrum setup, the localization
of the different fermion zero modes along the extra dimension naturally explains the observed flavor
structure and four-dimensional mass hierarchy of the SM fermions. We study the phenomenological
implications of the backreaction on the metric and the modified fermion profiles due to the bulk
scalar field on electroweak precision and flavor observables. Using up-to-date data, we show that
the unsuppressed contributions to the S, T, and $\epsilon_K$ parameters push the mass of the first
KK gluon above 10 TeV, both in minimal and custodially extended models, regardless of the effect
of the backreaction or the bulk scalar field. Furthermore, effective flavor-changing interactions
among the SM fermions induced by the bulk scalar are discussed. We also comment on the potential impact
of the Higgs portal interaction of the bulk scalar on the couplings of the Higgs boson.
