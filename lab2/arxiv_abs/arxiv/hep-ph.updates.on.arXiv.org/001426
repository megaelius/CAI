A comprehensive analysis on the photon self-energy, the fermion self-energy, and the fermion vertex
function is presented at one loop in the context of quantum electrodynamics (QED) with 1 extra dimension.
In 5-dimensional theories, characterized by an infinite number of Kaluza-Klein fields, one-loop
amplitudes involve discrete as well as continuous sums, $\sum^\infty_{n=1}\int d^4k$, that could
diverge. Using dimensional regularization, we express such sums as products of gamma and Epstein
functions, both defined on the complex plane, with divergences arising from poles of these functions
in the limit as $ D \to 4$. Using the analytical properties of the Epstein function, we show that the
ultraviolet divergences generated by the Kaluza-Klein sums can be consistently renormalized,
which means that the corresponding renormalized quantities reduce to the usual ones of QED at the
limit of a very large compactification scale $R^{-1}$. The main features of QED at the one-loop level
were studied. We use the mass-dependent $\mu$-scheme to calculate, in QED with an arbitrary number
$n$ of extra dimensions, a beta function fulfilling all desirable physical requirements. We argue
that in this type of theories, with a large mass spectrum covering a wide energy range, beta functions
should not be calculated by using mass-independent renormalization schemes. We show that the beta
function is finite for any energy $\mu$. In particular, it reduces to the usual QED result $e^3/12\pi^2$
for $m\ll \mu \ll R^{-1}$ and vanishes for $m\gg \mu$, with $m$ the usual fermion mass. Throughout
the work, the decoupling nature of all our results obtained from the analytical properties of the
Epstein function is stressed.
