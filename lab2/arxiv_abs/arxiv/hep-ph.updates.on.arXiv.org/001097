The one loop self energy of the neutral $\rho$ meson is obtained for the effective $\rho\pi\pi$ and
$\rho NN$ interaction at finite temperature and density in the presence of a constant background
magnetic field of arbitrary strength. In our approach, the eB-dependent vacuum part of the self
energy is extracted by means of dimensional regularization where the ultraviolet divergences
corresponding to the pure vacuum self energy manifest as the pole singularities of gamma as well
as Hurwitz zeta functions. This improved regularization procedure consistently reproduces the
expected results in the vanishing magnetic field limit and can be used quite generally in other self
energy calculations dealing with arbitrary magnetic field strength. In presence of the external
magnetic field, the general Lorentz structure for the in-medium vector boson self energy is derived
which can also be implemented in case of the gauge bosons such as photons and gluons. It has been shown
that with vanishing perpendicular momentum of the external particle, essentially two form factors
are sufficient to describe the self energy completely. Consequently, two distinct modes are observed
in the study of the effective mass, dispersion relations and the spectral function of $\rho^0$ where
one of the modes possesses two fold degeneracy. For large baryonic chemical potential, it is observed
that the critical magnetic field required to block the $\rho^0\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-$ decay channel
increases significantly with temperature. However, in case of smaller values reaching down to
vanishing chemical potential, the critical field follows the opposite trend.
