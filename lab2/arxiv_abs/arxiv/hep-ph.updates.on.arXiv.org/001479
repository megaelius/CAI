Cluster and hypernuclei production in heavy-ion collisions is presently under active experimental
and theoretical investigation. Since clusters are weekly bound objects, their production is very
sensitive to the dynamical evolution of the system and its interactions. The theoretical description
of cluster formation is related to the n-body problem. Here we present the novel n-body dynamical
transport approach PHQMD (Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics) which is designed to provide
a microscopic description of nuclear cluster and hypernucleus formation as well as of general particle
production in heavy-ion reactions at relativistic energies. In difference to the coalescence
or statistical models, often used for the cluster formation, in PHQMD clusters are formed dynamically
due to the interactions between baryons described on a basis of Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD)which
allows to propagate the n-body Wigner density and n-body correlations in phase-space, essential
for the cluster formation. The clusters are identified by the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) or the
SACA ('Simulated Annealing Cluster Algorithm') algorithm which finds the most bound configuration
of nucleons and clusters. Collisions among hadrons as well as Quark-Gluon-Plasma formation and
parton dynamics in PHQMD are treated in the same way as in the established PHSD (Parton-Hadron-String
Dynamics)transport approach. In order to verify our approach with respect to the general dynamics
we present here the first PHQMD results for general 'bulk' observables such as rapidity distributions
and transverse mass spectra for hadrons ($\pi, K, \bar K, p, \bar p, \Lambda, \bar \Lambda$) from
SIS to RHIC energies. We find a good description of the 'bulk' dynamics which allows us to proceed
with the results on cluster production, including hypernuclei.
