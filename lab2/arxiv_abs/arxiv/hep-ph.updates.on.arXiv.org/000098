Perturbative QCD (pQCD) running coupling a(Q^2) (=alpha_s(Q^2)/pi) is expected to get modified
at low spacelike momenta 0 < Q^2 < 1 GeV^2 so that, instead of having unphysical (Landau) singularities
it remains smooth and finite there, due to infared (IR) fixed point. This behavior is suggested by:
Gribov-Zwanziger approach, Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE), lattice calculations, light-front
holographic mapping AdS/CFT modified by a dilaton background, and by most of the analytic (holomorphic)
QCD models. All such couplings, A(Q^2), differ from the pQCD couplings a(Q^2) at |Q| > 1 GeV by
nonperturbative (NP) terms, typically by some power-suppressed terms ~1/(Q^2)^N. Evaluations
of low-energy physical QCD quantities in terms of such A(Q^2) couplings (with IR fixed point) at
a level beyond one-loop are usually performed with (truncated) power series in A(Q^2). We argue
that such an evaluation is not correct, because the NP terms in general get out of control as the number
of terms in the power series increases. The series consequently become increasingly unstable under
the variation of the renormalization scale, and have a fast asymptotic divergent behavior compounded
by the renormalon problem. We argue that an alternative series in terms of logarithmic derivatives
of A(Q^2) should be used. Further, a Pad\'e-related resummation based on this series gives results
which are renormalization scale independent and show very good convergence. Timelike low-energy
observables can be evaluated analogously, using the integral transformation which relates the
timelike observable with the corresponding spacelike observable.
