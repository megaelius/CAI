Within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization framework, we have computed the ${\mathcal
O}(\alpha_s^2)$ corrections to the exclusive production of $P$-wave spin-triplet charmonia
$\chi_{cJ}(J=0,1,2)$ accompanied by a hard photon at $B$ factories. For the first time, we have
explicitly verified the validity of NRQCD factorization for exclusive $P$-wave quarkonium production
at two-loop order. Unlike the $\chi_{cJ}$ electromagnetic decay processes, the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$
corrections are found to be smaller than the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ corrections in all three
channels $e^+e^-\to \chi_{c0,1,2}+\gamma$. In particular, the ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^2)$
corrections appear moderate for $\chi_{c1}$ case, and insignificant for $\chi_{c0}$. In addition,
the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) predictions for the production rates of $\chi_{c0,1}+\gamma$
are insensitive to the renormalization and factorization scales. All of these features may indicate
that perturbative expansion in these two channels exhibits a decent convergence behavior. By contrast,
both the ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s)$ and ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ corrections to the $\chi_{c2}+\gamma$
production cross section are sizable, which even reduces the Born order cross section by one order
of magnitude after including the NNLO perturbative correction. Taking the values of the long-distance
NRQCD matrix elements from nonrelativistic potential model, our prediction to $\chi_{c1}+\gamma$
production rate is consistent with the recent {\tt Belle} measurement. The NNLO predictions for
the $\chi_{c0,2}+\gamma$ production rates are much smaller than that for $\chi_{c1}+\gamma$,
which seems to naturally explain why the $e^+e^-\to \chi_{c0,2}+\gamma$ channels have escaped
experimental detection to date.
