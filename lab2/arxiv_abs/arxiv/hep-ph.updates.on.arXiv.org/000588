How the axial coupling constant $g_A$ in nuclear Gamow-Teller transitions described in shell model
gets "quenched" to a universal constant close to 1 can be explained by nuclear correlations in Fermi-liquid
fixed point theory using a scale-symmetric chiral Lagrangian supplemented with hidden local symmetric
vector mesons. Contrary to what one might naively suspect -- and has been discussed in some circles,
there is no fundamental quenching at nuclear matter density due to QCD condensates. When the density
of many-body systems treated with the same Lagrangian increases beyond the density $n=n_{1/2}\gsim
2n_0$ (where $n_0$ is the normal nuclear matter density) at which skyrmions representing baryons
fractionize to half-skyrmions, with the $\rho$ meson driven toward the vector manifestation fixed
point and a scalar meson $\sigma$ driven to the dilaton-limit fixed point with the nucleons parity
doubled, the dense matter supports the "pseudo-conformal" sound velocity for $n\gsim n_{1/2}$
while the trace of the energy momentum tensor remains non-vanishing. This signals the emergence
of scale symmetry not explicitly present in QCD in the vacuum. The fundamental constant $g_A$, unaffected
by QCD condensates for $n< n_{1/2}$, does go to 1 as the dilaton-limit fixed point is approached before
arriving at chiral restoration, but it is not directly related to the "quenched $g_A$" in nuclei
which can be explained as a Fermi-liquid fixed point quantity. The mechanism that produces a precocious
pseudo-conformal sound velocity impacts on the tidal deformability $\Lambda$ in gravity waves
from coalescing neutron stars.
