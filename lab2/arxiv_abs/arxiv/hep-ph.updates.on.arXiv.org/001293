The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations feature (BAO) imprinted in the clustering correlation function
is known to furnish us cosmic distance determinations that are independent of the cosmological-background
model and the primordial perturbation parameters. These measurements can be accomplished rigorously
by means of the Purely Geometric BAO methods. To date two different Purely Geometric BAO approaches
have been proposed. The first exploits the linear-point standard ruler. The second, called correlation-function
model-fitting, exploits the sound-horizon standard ruler. A key difference between them is that,
when estimated from clustering data, the linear point makes use of a cosmological-model-independent
procedure to extract the ratio of the ruler to the cosmic distance, while the correlation-function
model-fitting relies on a phenomenological cosmological model for the correlation function.
Nevertheless the two rulers need to be precisely defined independently of any specific observable.
We define the linear point and sound horizon and we characterize and compare the two rulers' cosmological-parameter
dependence. We find that they are both geometrical within the required accuracy, and they have the
same parameter dependence for a wide range of parameter values. We estimate the rulers' best-fit
values and errors given the cosmological constraints obtained by the Planck Satellite team from
the CMB measurements. We do this for three different cosmological models encompassed by the Purely
Geometric BAO methods. In each case we find that the relative errors of the two rulers coincide and
they are insensitive to the assumed cosmological model. Interestingly both the linear point and
the sound horizon shift by $0.5\sigma$ when we do not fix the spatial geometry to be flat in LCDM. This
points toward a sensitivity of the rulers to different cosmological models when they are estimated
from the CMB.
