We show the importance of searches for heavy resonant scalars. Taking cue from the present searches,
we make projections for searches in an extended scalar sector at the high luminosity $($HL$)$ run
of the Large Hadron Collider $($LHC$)$. We study the three most relevant search channels, $viz.$,
$H \rightarrow hh, H/A \rightarrow t\bar{t}$ and $b\bar{b}H/A$, where $H$ $(A)$ is a heavy scalar
$($pseudoscalar$)$. Upon studying multifarious final states for the resonant double Higgs production,
we find that the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ channels impose the strongest
limits. One can probe $\sigma(pp \rightarrow H \rightarrow hh)$ between $(104,17)$ fb for $m_H$
lying between $(300,600)$ GeV and between $(8,4)$ fb for $m_H$ lying between $(800,1000)$ GeV in
the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ channels, respectively, at $95\%$ CL. For
the $b\bar{b}H$ channel, we can exclude $\sigma(pp \rightarrow b\bar{b}H)$ between $(15,3)$
fb for $m_H$ lying between $(300,500)$ GeV. Our analyses will hold for several scenarios with heavy
Higgs extensions. However, we consider the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model $($pMSSM$)$ as an example and impose the present constraints from the SM$-$like Higgs measurements
and our future direct search limits and obtain strong constraints on the $m_A-\tan{\beta}$ parameter
space, where $m_A$ and $\tan{\beta}$ are respectively the mass of the pseudoscalar and the ratio
of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. Assuming that the heavy Higgs boson decays
only to Standard Model $($SM$)$ states, we find that the $H \rightarrow hh \rightarrow b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$
$(H \rightarrow t\bar{t})$ channel excludes $\tan{\beta}$ as low as $4$ ($m_A$ between $(400,800)$
GeV) at $95\%$ CL. This weakens up to $6.5$ when the $b\bar{b}H$ dominates. However, upon allowing
for non$-$SM decay modes, the limits change.
