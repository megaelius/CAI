In this thesis we try to discuss certain phenomenological aspects of an R-parity violating non-minimal
supersymmetric model, called $\mu\nu$SSM. We show that $\mu\nu$SSM can provide a solution to the
$\mu$-problem of supersymmetry and can simultaneously accommodate the existing three flavour
global data from neutrino experiments even at the tree level with the simple choice of flavour diagonal
neutrino Yukawa couplings. We show that it is also possible to achieve different mass hierarchies
for light neutrinos at the tree level itself. In $\mu\nu$SSM, the effect of R-parity violation together
with a seesaw mechanism with TeV scale right-handed neutrinos are instrumental for light neutrino
mass generation. We also analyze the stability of tree level neutrino masses and mixing with the
inclusion of one-loop radiative corrections. In addition, we investigate the sensitivity of the
one-loop corrections to different light neutrino mass orderings. Decays of the lightest supersymmetric
particle were also computed and ratio of certain decay branching ratios was observed to correlate
with certain neutrino mixing angle. We extend our analysis for different natures of the lightest
supersymmetric particle as well as with various light neutrino mass hierarchies. We present estimation
for the length of associated displaced vertices for various natures of the lightest supersymmetric
particle which can act as a discriminating feature at a collider experiment. We also present an unconventional
signal of Higgs boson in supersymmetry which can lead to a discovery, even at the initial stage of
the large hadron collider running. Besides, we show that a signal of this kind can also act as a probe
to the seesaw scale. Certain other phenomenological issues have also been addressed.
