We study the effect of various perturbative and nonperturbative QCD corrections on the free nucleon
structure functions ($F_{iN}^{WI}(x,Q^2); ~i=1-3$) and their implications in the determination
of nuclear structure functions. The evaluation of the nucleon structure functions has been performed
by using the MMHT 2014 PDFs parameterization, and the TMC and HT effects are incorporated following
the works of Schienbein et al. and Dasgupta et al., respectively. These nucleon structure functions
are taken as input in the determination of nuclear structure functions. The numerical calculations
for the $\nu_l/\bar\nu_l-A$ DIS process have been performed by incorporating the nuclear medium
effects like Fermi motion, binding energy, nucleon correlations, mesonic contributions, shadowing
and antishadowing in several nuclear targets such as carbon, polystyrene scintillator, iron and
lead which are being used in MINERvA, and in argon nucleus which is relevant for the ArgoNeuT and DUNE
experiments. The differential scattering cross sections $\frac{d^2\sigma_A^{WI}}{dx dy}$
and $(\frac{d\sigma_A^{WI}}{dx}/\frac{d\sigma_{CH}^{WI}}{dx})$ have also been studied in
the kinematic region of MINERvA experiment. The theoretical results are compared with the recent
experimental data of MINERvA and the earlier data of NuTeV, CCFR, CDHSW and CHORUS collaborations.
Moreover, a comparative analysis of the present results for the ratio $(\frac{d\sigma_A^{WI}}{dx}/\frac{d\sigma_{CH}^{WI}}{dx})$,
and the results from the MC generator GENIE and other phenomenological models of Bodek and Yang,
and Cloet et al., has been performed in the context of MINERvA experiment. The predictions have also
been made for $\bar\nu_l-A$ cross section relevant for MINERvA experiment.
