We extend recently developed methods used for determining the electromagnetic charge radius and
$a_\mu^{\pi\pi}$ to obtain a determination of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion, $F_\pi^V(t)$,
in several significant kinematical regions, using a parametrization-free formalism based on
analyticity and unitarity, and with the inclusion of precise inputs from both timelike and spacelike
regions. On the unitarity cut, below the first inelastic threshold we use the precisely known phase
of the form factor, known from $\pi\pi$ elastic scattering via the Fermi-Watson theorem, and above
the inelastic threshold a conservative integral condition on the modulus. We also use as input the
experimental values of the modulus at several energies in the elastic region, where the data from
$e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ and $\tau$ hadronic decays are mutually consistent, as well as the most
recent measurements at spacelike momenta. The experimental uncertainties are implemented by
Monte Carlo simulations. At spacelike values $Q^2=-t>0$ near the origin, our predictions are consistent
and significantly more precise than the recent QCD lattice calculations. The determinations at
larger $Q^2$ confirm the late onset of perturbative QCD for exclusive quantities. From the predictions
of $|F_\pi^V(t)|^2$ on the timelike axis below 0.63 GeV, we obtain the hadronic vacuum polarization
(HPV) contribution to the muon anomaly, $a_\mu^{\pi\pi}|_{\leq 0.63\gev} = (132.97\pm 0.70)\times
10^{-10}$, using input from both $e^+e^-$ annihilation and $\tau$ decay, and $a_\mu^{\pi\pi}|_{\leq
0.63 \gev} = (132.91\pm 0.76)\times 10^{-10}$ using only $e^+e^-$ input. Our determinations can
be readily extended to obtain such contributions in any interval of interest lying between $2 m_\pi$
and 0.63 GeV.
