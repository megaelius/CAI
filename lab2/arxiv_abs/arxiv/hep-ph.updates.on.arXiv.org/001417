As the increasing of neutrino energy or matter density, the neutrino oscillation in matter may undergo
"vacuum-dominated", "resonance" and "matter-dominated" three different stages successively.
Neutrinos endure very different matter effects, and therefore present very different oscillation
behaviors in these three different cases. In this paper, we focus on the less discussed matter-dominated
case (i.e., $|A^{}_{\rm CC}| \gg |\Delta m^{2}_{31}|$), study the effective neutrino mass and
mixing parameters as well as neutrino oscillation probabilities in dense matter using the perturbation
theory. We find that as the matter parameter $|A^{}_{\rm CC}|$ growing larger, the effective mixing
matrix in matter $\tilde{V}$ evolves approaching a fixed $3 \times 3$ constant real matrix which
is free of CP violation and can be described using only one simple mixing angle $\tilde{\theta}$
which is independent of $A^{}_{\rm CC}$. As for the neutrino oscillation behavior, $\nu^{}_{e}$
decoupled in the matter-dominated case due to its intense charged-current interaction with electrons
while a two-flavor oscillation are still presented between $\nu^{}_{\mu}$ and $\nu^{}_{\tau}$.
Numerical analysis are carried on to help understanding the salient features of neutrino oscillation
in matter as well as testing the validity of those concise approximate formulas we obtained. At the
end of this paper, we make a very bold comparison of the oscillation behaviors between neutrinos
passing through the Earth and passing through a typical white dwarf to give some embryo thoughts
on under what circumstances these studies will be applied and put forward the interesting idea of
possible "neutrino lensing" effect.
