We propose a quantum gravity-extended form of the classical length contraction law obtained in
Special Relativity. More specifically, the framework of our discussion is the UV self-complete
theory of quantum gravity. Against this background, we show how our results are consistent with,
i) the generalised form of the Uncertainty Principle (GUP), ii) the so called hoop-conjecture which
we interpret, presently, as the saturation of a Lorentz boost by the formation of a black hole in a
two-body scattering, and iii) the intriguing notion of "classicalization" of trans-Planckian
physics. Pushing these ideas to their logical conclusion, we argue that there is a physical limit
to the Lorentz contraction rule in the form of some minimal universal length determined by quantum
gravity, say the Planck Length, or any of its current embodiments such as the string length, or the
TeV quantum gravity length scale. In the latter case, we determine the \emph{critical boost} that
separates the ordinary "particle phase," characterized by the Compton wavelength, from the "black
hole phase", characterized by the effective Schwarzschild radius of the colliding system. Finally,
with the "classicalization" of quantum gravity in mind, we comment on the remarkable identity,
to our knowledge never noticed before, between three seemingly independent universal quantities,
namely, a) the "string tension", b) the "linear energy density," or \emph{tension} that exists
at the core of all Schwarzschild black holes, and c) the "superforce" i.e., the Planckian limit of
the static electro-gravitational force and, presumably, the unification point of all fundamental
forces.
