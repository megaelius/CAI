It is well established that the central deficit of dark matter (DM) observed in many dwarf galaxies
disagrees with the cuspy DM haloes predicted in the collision-less and cold DM (CDM) model. Plausible
solutions to this problem are based on an effective energy deposition into the central halo with
an origin that is either based on baryonic physics (e.g. supernova-driven gas blowouts; SNF) or
on new DM physics (e.g. self-interacting DM, SIDM). We argue that the fundamental difference between
the two is whether the process is impulsive or adiabatic, and explore novel ways to distinguishing
them by looking at the response of stellar orbits. We perform idealised simulations of tracers embedded
in a $1.48\times 10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ spherical halo, and model the creation of a $\sim1$kpc
DM matter core in SIDM with $\sigma_T/m_{\chi} = 2\,{\rm cm}^2{\rm g}^{-1}$ and through SNF by impulsively
removing a mass equivalent to $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the halo's potential energy. Choosing idealised
initial orbital configurations for the tracers, we find that radial actions are conserved (changed)
in the SIDM (impulsive) case. The adiabaticity of the SIDM case prevents tracers from changing their
orbital family during core formation whereas SNF separates tracers of initially the same family
to a variety of orbits. We show that these key features remain in a cosmological halo, albeit for a
few dynamical timescales. The number density and velocity dispersion profile of a Plummer sphere
with $r_{1/2} = 500$ pc change only marginally under adiabatic core formation, whereas SNF causes
a substantial expansion of the sphere driving it out of Jeans equilibrium. Our results point towards
promising ways of differentiating adiabatic from impulsive core formation.
