The polarized nucleon structure function in the nonsinglet case is investigated here by a new insight
rather than conventional perturbative QCD (pQCD). For this purpose we note that the solution of
the evolution equations in moment space involves noninteger powers of the coupling constant. Therefore
it is possible to employ a new approach which is called fractional analytical perturbation theory
Consequently, it is possible to remove the Landau singularities of the renormalized coupling,
i.e., at the scales $Q \sim \Lambda$, using this approach. This provides an opportunity to continue
the desired calculations toward small values of energy scales even less than the $\Lambda$ scale.
To modify the analytical perturbation theory, a newer approach is introduced, called 2$\delta$anQCD,
in which the spectral function of the holomorphic coupling is parameterized in the low-energy region
by two delta functions. This model gives us more reliable results for the considered QCD observables,
even in the deep infrared region. We calculate the nonsinglet part of the polarized nucleon structure
function, using the 2$\delta$anQCD model, and compare it with the result from the underlying pQCD
where both are in a new defined scheme, called the Lambert scheme. For this purpose we employ the anQCD
package in the \textit{Mathematica} environment to establish the analytic (holomorphic) coupling
constant. The results at various energy scales are also compared with the available experimental
data, and it turns out that there is a good consistency between them. The results show that the obtained
nucleon structure function at small energy scales has smoother behavior when using the 2$\delta$anQCD
model than the underlying pQCD. In fact the coupling constant in analytic QCD behaves moderately
and it makes the result approach the available data in a better way.
