We examine the robustness of collider phenomenology predictions for a dark sector scenario with
QCD-like properties. Pair production of dark quarks at the LHC can result in a wide variety of signatures,
depending on the details of the new physics model. A particularly challenging signal results when
prompt production induces a parton shower that yields a high multiplicity of collimated dark hadrons
with subsequent decays to Standard Model hadrons. The final states contain jets whose substructure
encodes their non-QCD origin. This is a relatively subtle signature of strongly coupled beyond
the Standard Model dynamics, and thus it is crucial that analyses incorporate systematic errors
to account for the approximations that are being made when modeling the signal. We estimate theoretical
uncertainties for a canonical substructure observable designed to be sensitive to the gauge structure
of the underlying object, the two-point energy correlator $e_2^{(\beta)}$, by computing envelopes
between resummed analytic distributions and numerical results from Pythia. We explore the separability
against the QCD background as the confinement scale, number of colors, number of flavors, and dark
quark masses are varied. Additionally, we investigate the uncertainties inherent to modeling
dark sector hadronization. Simple estimates are provided that quantify one's ability to distinguish
these dark sector jets from the overwhelming QCD background. Such a search would benefit from theory
advances to improve the predictions, and the increase in statistics using the additional data to
be collected at the high luminosity LHC.
