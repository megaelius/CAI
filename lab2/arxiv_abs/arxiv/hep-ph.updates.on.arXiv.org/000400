We present the results of an improved Monte Carlo Glauber (MCG) model of relevance for collisions
involving nuclei at center-of-mass energies of BNL RHIC ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=0.2$ TeV), CERN LHC
($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$-$8.8$ TeV), and proposed future hadron colliders ($\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}}\approx 10$-$63$ TeV). The inelastic pp cross sections as a function of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$
are obtained from a precise data-driven parametrization that exploits the many available measurements
at LHC collision energies. We describe the nuclear transverse profile with two separated 2-parameter
Fermi distributions for protons and neutrons to account for their different densities close to
the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, we model the nucleon degrees of freedom inside the nucleus
through a lattice with a minimum nodal separation, combined with a "recentering and reweighting"
procedure, that overcomes some limitations of previous MCG approaches. The nuclear overlap function,
number of participant nucleons and binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, participant eccentricity
and triangularity, overlap area and average path length are presented in intervals of percentile
centrality for lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-lead (pPb) collisions at all collision energies. We
demonstrate for collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV that the central values of the Glauber
quantities change by up to 7%, in a few bins of reaction centrality, due to the improvements implemented,
though typically remain within the previously assigned systematic uncertainties, while their
associated uncertainties are generally smaller (mostly below 5%) at all centralities than for
earlier calculations. Tables for all quantities versus centrality at present and foreseen collision
energies involving Pb nuclei, as well as for collisions of XeXe at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.44$, and
AuAu and CuCu at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=0.2$ TeV, are provided.
