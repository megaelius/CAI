We introduce a 3-Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) with two Inert (or dark) (pseudo)scalar doublets and
an active Higgs one, hence termed I(2+1)HDM, in the presence of a discrete $Z_3$ acting upon the three
doublet fields. Assuming a maximally symmetric configuration of the parameters related to the
two dark doublets, known in literature as `dark democracy', we show that such a construct yields
a two-component Dark Matter (DM) model and the two DM candidates have opposite CP parity. Herein,
the most interesting solutions, those that saturate the relic density and where contributions
to the latter from the two DM candidates are of similar magnitude, are achieved when there is a high
level of degeneracy in the (dark) charged sector. %we show that such a construct yields a two-component
Dark Matter (DM) model. Herein, the most interesting solutions, those that saturate the relic density
and where contributions to the latter from the two DM candidates are of similar magnitude, are normally
found when the two DM states have opposite CP parity. Furthermore, such dynamics is achieved when
there is a high level of degeneracy in the (dark) charged sector. In order to probe this phenomenology,
we have produced a set of benchmark scenarios in the I(2+1)HDM, with the invoked $Z_3$ symmetry,
which are further compliant with (in)direct searches for DM as well as other experimental data impinging
on both the dark and Higgs sectors of the model, chiefly, in the form of Electro-Weak Precision Observables
(EWPOs), Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
and void searches for additional (pseudo)scalar states at the CERN machine and previous colliders.
