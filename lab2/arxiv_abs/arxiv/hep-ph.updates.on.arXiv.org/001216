I study the flavor evolution of a dense neutrino gas by considering vacuum contributions, matter
effects and neutrino self-interactions. Assuming a system of two flavors in a uniform matter background,
the time evolution of the many-body system in discretized momentum space is computed. The multi-angle
neutrino-neutrino interactions are treated exactly and compared to both the single-angle approximation
and mean field calculations. The time unit chosen is $\mu_0^{-1}=(\frac{G_F}{2\sqrt{2}V})^{-1}$.
The mono-energetic two neutrino beam scenario is solved analytically. I proceed to solve flavor
oscillations for mono-energetic cubic lattices and quadratic lattices of two energy levels. In
addition I study various configurations of twelve, sixteen, and twenty neutrinos. I find that when
all neutrinos are initially of the same flavor, all methods agree. When both flavors are present,
I find fast collective oscillations and rapid flavor equilibration develop both for mono-energetic
scenarios and when neutrinos have different momentum magnitudes. However, this is not seen in the
mean field treatment. The difference can be ascribed to non-negligible flavor polarization correlations
being present. Even in dense matter environments I find rapid flavor equilibration from the many-body
treatment while the mean field approximation shows no flavor oscillation at all. Entanglement
entropy is significant in all such cases. The relevance for supernovae or neutron stars mergers
is contingent upon the value of the normalization volume $V$ and the large $N$ dependence of the timescale
associated with oscillations. In future work, I intend study this dependence using larger lattices
and include anti-neutrinos.
