Observations of gravitational radiation from compact binary systems provide an unprecedented
opportunity to test General Relativity in the strong field dynamical regime. In this paper, we investigate
how future observations of gravitational radiation from binary neutron star mergers might provide
constraints on finite-range forces from a universally coupled massive scalar field. Such scalar
degrees of freedom are a characteristic feature of many extensions of General Relativity. For concreteness,
we work in the context of metric $f(R)$ gravity, which is equivalent to General Relativity and a universally
coupled scalar field with a non-linear potential whose form is fixed by the choice of $f(R)$. In theories
where neutron stars (or other compact objects) obtain a significant scalar charge, the resulting
attractive finite-range scalar force has implications for both the inspiral and merger phases
of binary systems. We first present an analysis of the inspiral dynamics in Newtonian limit, and
forecast the constraints on the mass of the scalar and charge of the compact objects for the Advanced
LIGO gravitational wave observatory. We then perform a comparative study of binary neutron star
mergers in General Relativity with those of a one-parameter model of $f(R)$ gravity using fully
relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. These simulations elucidate the effects of the scalar
on the merger and post-merger dynamics. We comment on the utility of the full waveform (inspiral,
merger, post-merger) to probe different regions of parameter space for both the particular model
of $f(R)$ gravity studied here and for finite-range scalar forces more generally.
