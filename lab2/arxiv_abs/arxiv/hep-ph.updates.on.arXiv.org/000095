The current status of various thermal and statistical descriptions of particle production in the
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions experiments is presented in detail. We discuss the formulation
of various types of thermal models of a hot and dense hadron gas (HG) and the methods incorporated
in implementing the interactions between hadrons. We first obtain the parameterization of center-of-mass
energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) in terms of temperature ($T$) and baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$)
obtained by analyzing the particle ratios at the freeze-out over a broad energy range from the lowest
Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) energy to the highest Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider
(RHIC) energies. The results of various thermal models together with the experimental results
for the various ratios of yields of produced hadrons are then compared. We have derived some new universal
conditions emerging at the chemical freeze-out of HG fireball which demonstrate the independence
with respect to the energy as well as the structure of the nuclei used in the collision. Further, we
perform the calculation of various transport properties of HG such as shear viscosity-to-entropy
density ratio ($\eta/s$) etc. using thermal model and compare with the results of other models.
We also present the calculation of the rapidity as well as transverse mass spectra of various hadrons
in the thermal HG model. The purpose of this review article is to organize and summarize the experimental
data obtained in various experiments with heavy-ion collisions and then to examine and analyze
them using thermal models so that a firm conclusion regarding the formation of quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) can be obtained.
