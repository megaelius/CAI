Two major problems call for an extension of the Standard Model (SM): the hierarchy problem in the
Higgs sector and the dark matter in the Universe. The discovery of a Higgs boson with mass of about
125 GeV was clearly the most significant piece of news from CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In
addition to representing the ultimate triumph of the SM, it shed new light on the hierarchy problem
and opened up new ways of probing new physics. The various measurements performed at Run I of the LHC
constrain the Higgs couplings to SM particles as well as invisible and undetected decays. In this
thesis, the impact of the LHC Higgs results on various new physics scenarios is assessed, carefully
taking into account uncertainties and correlations between them. Generic modifications of the
Higgs coupling strengths, possibly arising from extended Higgs sectors or higher-dimensional
operators, are considered. Furthermore, specific new physics models are tested. This includes,
in particular, the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. While a Higgs boson
has been found, no sign of beyond the SM physics was observed at Run I of the LHC in spite of the large
number of searches performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The implications of the negative
results obtained in these searches constitute another important part of this thesis. First, supersymmetric
models with a dark matter candidate are investigated in light of the negative searches for supersymmetry
at the LHC using a so-called "simplified model" approach. Second, tools using simulated events
to constrain any new physics scenario from the LHC results are presented. Moreover, during this
thesis the selection criteria of several beyond the SM analyses have been reimplemented in the MadAnalysis
5 framework and made available in a public database.
