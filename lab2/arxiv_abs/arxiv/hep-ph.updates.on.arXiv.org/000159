The eXciting Dark Matter (XDM) model was proposed as a mechanism to efficiently convert the kinetic
energy (in sufficiently hot environments) of dark matter into e+e- pairs. The standard scenario
invokes a doublet of nearly degenerate DM states, and a dark force to mediate a large upscattering
cross section between the two. For heavy ($\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs in large (galaxy-sized
or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy positrons. For lighter dark matter, this is
kinematically impossible, and the unique observable signature becomes an X-ray line, arising
from $\chi \chi \rightarrow \chi^* \chi^*$, followed by $\chi^* \rightarrow \chi \gamma$. This
variant of XDM is distinctive from other DM X-ray scenarios in that it tends to be most present in more
massive, hotter environments, such as clusters, rather than nearby dwarfs, and has different dependencies
from decaying models. We find that it is capable of explaining the recently reported X-ray line at
3.56 keV. For very long lifetimes of the excited state, primordial decays can explain the signal
without the presence of upscattering. Thermal models freeze-out as in the normal XDM setup, via
annihilations to the light boson $\phi$. For suitable masses the annihilation $\chi \chi \rightarrow
\phi \phi$ followed by $\phi \rightarrow SM$ can explain the reported gamma-ray signature from
the galactic center. Direct detection is discussed, including the possibility of explaining DAMA
via the "Luminous" dark matter approach. Quite generally, the proximity of the 3.56 keV line to the
energy scale of DAMA motivates a reexamination of electromagnetic explanations. Other signals,
including lepton jets and the modification of cores of dwarf galaxies are also considered.
