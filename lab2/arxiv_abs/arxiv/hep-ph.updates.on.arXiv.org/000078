The current flow of high accuracy astrophysical data, among which are the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, offers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain
the inflationary theory. This is however a challenging project given the size of the inflationary
landscape which contains hundreds of different scenarios. Given that there is currently no observational
evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature perturbations or any other non-minimal
extension of the inflationary paradigm, a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models
first, namely the slow-roll single field models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us
with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and efficient strategies.
It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of approximate model independent methods while
a more ambitious alternative is to study the inflationary scenarios one by one. We have developed
the new publicly available runtime library ASPIC to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code
provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating consistent observable predictions within
this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an evolutive code which presently supports 70
different models, a number that may be compared with three or four representing the present state
of the art. In this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in a systematic
manner, thereby constituting the first Encyclopaedia Inflationaris. Finally, we discuss how
this procedure and ASPIC could be used to determine the best model of inflation by means of Bayesian
inference.
