Recent results from direct and indirect searches for dark matter (DM) have motivated the study of
particle physics models that can provide weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in the mass
range 1-50 GeV. Viable candidates for light WIMP DM must fulfil stringent constraints. On the one
hand, the observation at the LHC of a Higgs boson with Standard Model properties set an upper bound
on the coupling of light DM particles to the Higgs, thereby making it difficult to reproduce the correct
relic abundance. On the other hand, the recent results from direct searches in the CDMSlite, SuperCDMS
and LUX experiments have set upper constraints on the DM scattering cross section. In this paper,
we investigate the viability of light right-handed sneutrino DM in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric
Model (NMSSM) in the light of these constraints. To this aim, we have carried out a scan in the NMSSM
parameter space, imposing experimental bounds on the Higgs sector and low-energy observables,
such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment and branching ratios of rare decays. We demonstrate that
the enlarged Higgs sector of the NMSSM, together with the flexibility provided by the RH sneutrino
parameters, make it possible to obtain viable RH sneutrino DM with a mass as light as 2 GeV. We have
also considered the upper bounds on the annihilation cross section from Fermi LAT data on dwarf spheroidal
galaxies, and extracted specific examples with mass in the range 8-50 GeV that could account for
the apparent low-energy excess in the gamma-ray emission at the Galactic Centre. Then, we have computed
the theoretical predictions for the elastic scattering cross-section of RH sneutrinos. Finally,
after imposing the recent bounds from SuperCDMS and LUX, we have found a wide area of the parameter
space that could be probed by future low-threshold direct detection experiments.
