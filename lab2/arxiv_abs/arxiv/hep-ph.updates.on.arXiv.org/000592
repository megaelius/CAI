In this paper we show, that the $J/\psi$ production in DIS, is the main source of information about
the events with two parton shower production. We attempt to develop our theoretical acumen of this
process, to a level compatible with the theoretical description of inclusive DIS. We revisit the
problem of the linear evolution equation for the double gluon densities, and include Bose-Einstein
enhancement to these equations. We find that the Bose-Einstein correlations lead to an increase
of the anomalous dimension, which turns out to be suppressed as $1/(N^2_c -1)^2$, in agreement with
the estimates for the twist four anomalous dimension. We believe that understanding what happens
to these contributions at ultra high energies, is a key question for an effective theory, based on
high energy QCD. We derive the evolution equation for the scattering amplitude of two dipoles with
a nucleus, taking into account the shadowing corrections, and investigate the analytical solutions
in two distinct kinematic regions: deep in the saturation region, and in the vicinity of the saturation
scale. The suggested non-linear evolution equation is a direct generalization of the Balitsky-Kovchegov
equation, which has to be solved with the initial condition that depends on the saturation scale
$Q_s(Y=Y_0,b)$. With the goal of finding a new small parameter, it is instructive to compare the
solution of the non-linear equation with the qusi-classical approximation, in which in the initial
condition we replace $Q_s(Y=Y_0,b)$ by $Q_s(Y,b)$. Our final result is that the shadowing corrections
in the elastic amplitude generate the survival probability, which suppresses the growth of the
amplitude with energy, caused by the Bose-Einstein enhancement.
