By comparing the two- and three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models, we demonstrate that
the naively expected vacuum superconductivity (VSC) in constant magnetic field ${\bf B}=B\hat
z$ is disfavored due to the splitting magnetic catalysis effect (MCE) to chiral condensates with
different quark flavors. Based on the simple two-flavor NJL model, we illuminate, in the lowest
Landau level approximation, the similar origins of $\pi^0$ and $\bar{\rho}^+_1$ (${\rho}^+$
meson with spin $S_z=1$) mass reductions with smaller $B$ and their different features at larger
$B$. With the full Landau levels, the two-flavor NJL model is found to be invalid to study the magnetic
field effect to $\bar{\rho}^+_1$ meson with physical vacuum mass $775~{\rm MeV}$. Then, restricted
to $\rho$ meson mass below two-quark threshold in vacuum, that is $m_\rho^v<2m_q^v$, it is found
that $\pi^0$ mass decreases and then increases with $B$ slowly, and $\bar{\rho}^+_1$ mass vanishing
point is delayed to larger $B$ compared to the point particle result. In the more realistic three-flavor
NJL model, all the quark masses split in strong magnetic field as a combinatorial result of their
different current masses and electric charges. By choosing a vacuum mass closer to the physical
one, $\bar{\rho}^+_1$ meson mass is found to be consistent with the LQCD results semi-quantitatively
in smaller $B$ region but increase in larger $B$ region. These features are mainly outcomes of the
interplay between the $S_z-B$ coupling effect and splitting MCE to the composite $u$ and $d$ quarks,
which definitely disfavors VSC when the latter dominates. Furthermore, mesonic flavor mixing
is modified by $B$ among the neutral pseudoscalars: $\pi^0,\eta_0$ and $\eta_8$, which is very
important to suppress the mass enhancement of the effective mass eigenstates at large $B$.
