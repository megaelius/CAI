We derive fermionic Green's functions in the background of the Euclidean solitons describing false
vacuum decay in a prototypal Higgs-Yukawa theory. In combination with appropriate counterterms
for the masses, couplings and wave-function normalization, these can be used to calculate radiative
corrections to the soliton solutions and transition rates that fully account for the inhomogeneous
background provided by the nucleated bubble. We apply this approach to the archetypal example of
transitions between the quasi-degenerate vacua of a massive scalar field with a quartic self-interaction.
The effect of fermion loops is compared with those from additional scalar fields, and the loop effects
accounting for the spacetime inhomogeneity of the tunneling configuration are compared with those
where gradients are neglected. We find that scalar loops lead to an enhancement of the decay rate,
whereas fermion loops lead to a suppression. These effects get relatively amplified by a perturbatively
small factor when gradients are accounted for. In addition, we observe that the radiative corrections
to the solitonic field profiles are smoother when the gradients are included. The method presented
here for computing fermionic radiative corrections should be applicable beyond the archetypal
example of vacuum decay. In particular, we work out methods that are suitable for calculations in
the thin-wall limit, as well as others that take account of the full spherical symmetry of the solution.
For the latter case, we construct the Green's functions based on spin hyperspherical harmonics,
which are eigenfunctions of the appropriate angular momentum operators that commute with the Dirac
operator in the solitonic background.
