Solving by a canonical string theory, of closed strings for the glueballs and open strings for the
mesons, the 't Hooft large-$N$ expansion of QCD is a long-standing problem that resisted all the
attempts despite the advent of the celebrated gauge/gravity duality in the framework of string
theory. We demonstrate that in the canonical string framework such a solution does not actually
exist because an inconsistency arises between the renormalization properties of the QCD S matrix
at large $N$ -- a consequence of the asymptotic freedom (AF) -- and the open/closed duality of the
would-be string solution. Specifically, the would-be open-string one-loop corrections to the
tree glueball amplitudes must be ultraviolet (UV) divergent. Hence, naively, the inconsistency
arises because these amplitudes are dual to tree closed-string diagrams, which are universally
believed to be both UV finite -- since they are closed-string tree diagrams -- and infrared finite
because of the glueball mass gap. In fact, the inconsistency follows from a low-energy theorem of
the NSVZ type that controls the renormalization in QCD-like theories. The inconsistency extends
to the would-be canonical string for a vast class of 't Hooft large-$N$ QCD-like theories including
$\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY QCD. We also demonstrate that the presently existing SUSY string models with
a mass gap -- such as Klebanov-Strassler, Polchinski-Strassler (PS) and certain PS variants --
cannot contradict the above-mentioned results since they are not asymptotically free. Moreover,
we shed light on the way the open/closed string duality may be perturbatively realized in these string
models compatibly with a mass gap in the 't Hooft-planar closed-string sector and the low-energy
theorem because of the lack of AF. Finally, we suggest a noncanonical way-out for QCD-like theories
based on topological strings on noncommutative twistor space.
