We propose an effective model arising from a scale-invariant hidden scalar-QCD sector, to explain
the dynamical origin of electroweak symmetry breaking, together with the origin of mass and the
fine-tuning of Higgs mass term. This effective model includes the dynamical-scale anomaly-effect
from the hidden QCD gluons, to explicitly break the classical scale invariance at the level of an
effective field theory, known as the leading-order scale-symmetry (LOSS). In the phenomenological
analysis, the proposed model predicts a light composite dilaton composed of hidden scalar quarks
and gluons with the mass around electroweak scale (around 280 GeV), and has only one input parameter,
which is the mixing angle between the Higgs boson and the composite dilaton. Our result for dilaton
mass is in accord with the lattice simulation for scalar QCD, where the scalar-quark bound states
acquire a large effective mass from the hidden gluon contribution. Furthermore, we predict several
significant deviations from the SM, like the resonant and non-resonant diHiggs production cross
section, that could be directly tested at the high luminosity LHC. We present the first study of diHiggs
production signal predicted from a scale(conformal)-invariant hidden sector, even from dark/hidden
QCD. This model can thus potentially provide a competitive explanation for many exotic phenomena
beyond the standard model, that can be directly probed in the future experiment, not merely including
the possibility of dark matter candidates and a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition,
as have extensively been explored in the literature.
