We have explored how the electrical and thermal conductivities in a thermal QCD medium get affected
in weak-momentum anisotropy arising due to a strong magnetic field. This study, in turn, facilitates
to understand the duration of strong magnetic field, Wiedemann-Franz law, and the Knudsen number.
We calculate the conductivities by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in relaxation-time
approximation. The interactions among partons are incorporated within the quasiparticle approach
at finite $T$ and strong $B$. We have found that the electrical conductivity decreases with the temperature
in a magnetic field-driven anisotropy, which is opposite to its behavior in an expansion-driven
anisotropy. Whereas the thermal conductivity increases very slowly with the temperature, unlike
its rapid increase in the expansion-driven anisotropy, thus both $\sigma_{\rm el}$ and $\kappa$
may distinguish the origin of anisotropies. The above findings in conductivities are attributed
to three factors: {\em Firstly}, the weak-momentum anisotropies are generated either by the strong
magnetic field or by the asymptotic expansion. {\em Secondly}, the phase-space factor. {\em Thirdly}
the relaxation-time of quarks. We have extracted the time-dependence of initially produced strong
magnetic field by $\sigma_{\rm el}$, where the magnetic field expectedly decays slower than in
vacuum. However, due to the presence of weak-anisotropy, magnetic field decays relatively faster
than in isotropic one. The Knudsen number decreases with the temperature, but the presence of expansion-driven
anisotropy reduces its magnitude. However, the strong magnetic field raises its value but, remains
less than one. Finally, $\kappa/\sigma_{\rm el}$ in magnetic field, increases with temperature,
but with a magnitude larger than in isotropic medium and smaller than in expansion-driven anisotropic
medium.
