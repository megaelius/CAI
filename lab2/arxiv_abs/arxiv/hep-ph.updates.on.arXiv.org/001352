Theoretical predictions for ttbb production are of crucial importance for ttH measurements in
the H->bb channel at the LHC. To address the large uncertainties associated with the modelling of
extra QCD radiation in ttbb events, in this paper we present a calculation of pp->ttbbj at NLO QCD.
The behaviour of NLO corrections is analysed in a variety of observables, and to assess theoretical
uncertainties we use factor-two rescalings as well as different dynamic scales. In this context,
we propose a systematic alignment of dynamic scales that makes it possible to disentangle normalisation
and shape uncertainties in a transparent way. Scale uncertainties at NLO are typically at the level
of 20-30% in fiducial cross sections, and below 10% for the shapes of distributions. The kinematics
of QCD radiation is investigated in detail, including the effects of its recoil on the objects of
the ttbb system. In particular, we discuss various azimuthal correlations that allow one to charaterise
the QCD recoil pattern in a precise and transparent way. In general, the calculation at hand provides
a variety of precise benchmarks that can be used to validate the modelling of QCD radiation in ttbb
generators. Moreover, as we will argue, pp->ttbbj at NLO entails information that can be used to
gain insights into the perturbative convergence of the inclusive ttbb cross section beyond NLO.
Based on this idea, we address the issue of the large NLO K-factor observed in the ttbb cross section,
and we provide evidence that supports the reduction of this K-factor through a mild adjustment of
the QCD scales that are conventionally used for this process. The presented 2->5 NLO calculations
have been carried out using OpenLoops 2 in combination with Sherpa and Munich.
