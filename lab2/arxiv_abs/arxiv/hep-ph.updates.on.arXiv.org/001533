Exascale computing could soon enable a predictive theory of nuclear structure and reactions rooted
in the Standard Model, with quantifiable and systematically improvable uncertainties. Such a
predictive theory will help exploit experiments that use nucleons and nuclei as laboratories for
testing the Standard Model and its limitations. Examples include direct dark matter detection,
neutrinoless double beta decay, and searches for permanent electric dipole moments of the neutron
and atoms. It will also help connect QCD to the properties of cold neutron stars and hot supernova
cores. We discuss how a quantitative bridge between QCD and the properties of nuclei and nuclear
matter will require a synthesis of lattice QCD (especially as applied to two- and three-nucleon
interactions), effective field theory, and ab initio methods for solving the nuclear many-body
problem. While there are significant challenges that must be addressed in developing this triad
of theoretical tools, the rapid advance of computing is accelerating progress. In particular,
we focus this review on the anticipated advances from lattice QCD and how these advances will impact
few-body effective theories of nuclear physics by providing critical input, such as constraints
on unknown low-energy constants of the effective (field) theories. We also review particular challenges
that must be overcome for the successful application of lattice QCD for low-energy nuclear physics.
We describe progress in developing few-body effective (field) theories of nuclear physics, with
an emphasis on HOBET, a non-relativistic effective theory of nuclear physics, which is less common
in the literature. We use the examples of neutrinoless double beta decay and the nuclear-matter
equation of state to illustrate how the coupling of lattice QCD to effective theory might impact
our understanding of symmetries and exotic astrophysical environments.
