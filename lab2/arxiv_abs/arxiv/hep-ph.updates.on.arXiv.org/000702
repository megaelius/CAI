By employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach, we calculated the branching
ratios, CP-violating asymmetries, the longitudinal and transverse polarization fractions and
other physical observables of the thirteen charmless hadronic $\bar{B}^0_s \to V V $ decays with
the inclusion of all currently known next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions. We focused on
the examination of the effects of all those currently known NLO contributions and found that: (a)
for the measured decays $\bar{ B}_s^0 \to \phi \phi, K^{*0} \phi,\bar K^{*0} K^{*0}$ and $\rho^0
\phi$, the NLO contributions can provide $\sim 20\%$ to $\sim 40\%$ enhancements to the leading
order (LO) PQCD predictions of their CP-averaged branching ratios, and consequently the agreement
between the PQCD predictions and the measured values are improved effectively after the inclusion
of the NLO contributions; (b) for the measured decays, the NLO corrections to the LO PQCD predictions
for $(f_L,f_\perp)$ and $(\phi_{\|},\phi_{\bot})$ are generally small in size, but the weak penguin
annihilation contributions play an important role in understanding the data about their decay
rates, $f_L$ and $f_\perp$; (c) the NLO PQCD predictions for above mentioned physical observables
do agree with the measured ones and the theoretical predictions from the QCDF, SCET and FAT approaches;
(d) for other considered $B_s^0 \to VV$ decays, the NLO PQCD predictions for their decay rates and
other physical observables are also basically consistent with the theoretical predictions from
other popular approaches, future precision measurements could help us to test or examine these
predictions.
