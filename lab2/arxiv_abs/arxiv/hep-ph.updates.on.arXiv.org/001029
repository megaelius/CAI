The conventional approach to fixed-order perturbative QCD predictions is based on an arbitrary
choice of the renormalization scale, together with an arbitrary range. This {\it ad hoc} assignment
of the renormalization scale causes the coefficients of the QCD running coupling at each perturbative
order to be strongly dependent on the choice of both the renormalization scale and the renormalization
scheme. However, such ambiguities are not necessary, since as a basic requirement of renormalization
group invariance (RGI), any physical observable must be independent of the choice of both the renormalization
scheme and the renormalization scale. In fact, if one uses the {\it Principle of Maximum Conformality}
(PMC) to fix the renormalization scale, the coefficients of the pQCD series match the series of conformal
theory, and they are thus scheme independent. It has been found that the elimination of the scale
and scheme ambiguities at all orders relies heavily on how precisely we know the analytic form of
the QCD running coupling $\alpha_s$. In this review, we summarize the known properties of the QCD
running coupling and its recent progresses, especially for its behavior within the asymptotic
region. We also summarize the current progress on the PMC and some of its typical applications, showing
to what degree the conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities can be eliminated
after applying the PMC. We also compare the PA approach for the conventional scale-dependent pQCD
series and the PMC scale-independent conformal series. We observe that by using the conformal series,
the PA approach can provide a more reliable estimate of the magnitude of the uncalculated terms.
And if the conformal series for an observable has been calculated up to $n_{\rm th}$-order level,
then the $[N/M]=[0/n-1]$-type PA series provides an important estimate for the higher-order terms.
