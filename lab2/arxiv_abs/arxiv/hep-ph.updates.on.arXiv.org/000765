Recently the Belle collaboration has discovered a narrow $S=-3$ baryon, the $\Omega(2012)$. We
explore the possibility that the $\Omega(2012)$ is a $\Xi(1530)\,\bar K$ molecule, where the binding
mechanism is the coupled channel dynamics with the $\Omega\,\eta$ channel. The characteristic
signature of a molecular $\Omega(2012)$ will be its decay into the three body channel $\Xi \pi \bar{K}$,
for which we expect a partial decay width of $2-3\,{\rm MeV}$. The partial decay width into the $\Xi
\bar{K}$ channel should lie in the range of $1-11\,{\rm MeV}$, a figure compatible with experiment
and which we have deduced from the assumption that the coupling involved in this decay is of natural
size. For comparison purposes the decay of a purely compact $\Omega(2012)$ into the $\Xi \bar{K}$
and $\Xi \pi \bar{K}$ channels is of the same order of magnitude as and one order of magnitude smaller
than in the molecular scenario, respectively. This comparison indicates that the current experimental
information is insufficient to distinguish between a compact and a molecular $\Omega(2012)$ and
further experiments will be required to determine its nature. A molecular $\Omega(2012)$ will
also imply the existence of two- and three-body molecular partners. The two-body partners comprise
two $\Lambda$ hyperons located at $1740$ and $1950\,{\rm MeV}$ respectively, the first of which
might correspond to the $\Lambda(1800)$ while the second to the $\Lambda(2000)$ or the $\Lambda(2050)$.
The three-body partners include a $\Xi(1530) K\bar{K}$ and a $\Xi(1530) \eta \bar{K}$ molecule,
with masses of $M = 2385-2445\,{\rm MeV}$ and $M = 2434-2503\,{\rm MeV}$ respectively. We might
be tempted to identify the first with the $\Xi(2370)$ and the latter with the $\Omega(2470)$ listed
in the PDG.
