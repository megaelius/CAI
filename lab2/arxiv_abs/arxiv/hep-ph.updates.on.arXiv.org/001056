For leptogenesis with heavy sterile neutrinos above the electroweak scale, asymmetries produced
at early times (in the relativistic regime) are relevant, if they are protected from washout. This
can occur for weak washout or when the asymmetry is partly protected by being transferred to spectator
fields. We thus study the relevance of relativistic effects for leptogenesis in a minimal seesaw
model with two sterile neutrinos in the strongly hierarchical limit. Starting from first principles,
we derive a set of momentum-averaged fluid equations to calculate the final $B-L$ asymmetry as a
function of the washout strength and for different initial conditions at order one accuracy. For
this, we take the leading fluid approximation for the relativistic $CP$-even and odd rates. Assuming
that spectator fields remain in chemical equilibrium, we find that for weak washout, relativistic
corrections lead to a sign flip and an enhancement of the asymmetry for a vanishing initial abundance
of sterile neutrinos. As an example for the effect of partially equilibrated spectators, we consider
bottom-Yukawa and weak-sphaleron interactions in leptogenesis driven by sterile neutrinos with
masses $\gtrsim 5\times10^{12}$ GeV. For a vanishing initial abundance of sterile neutrinos,
this can give rise to another flip and an absolute enhancement of the final asymmetry in the strong
washout regime by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the cases either without spectators or
with fully equilibrated ones. These effects are less pronounced for thermal initial conditions
for the sterile neutrinos. The $CP$-violating source in the relativistic regime at early times
is important as it is proportional to the product of lepton-number violating and lepton-number
conserving rates, and therefore less suppressed than an extrapolation of the nonrelativistic
approximations may suggest.
