Prior to recombination, Silk damping causes the dissipation of energy from acoustic waves into
the monopole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), resulting in spectral distortions. These
can be used to probe the primordial scalar power spectrum on smaller scales than it is possible with
CMB anisotropies. An enhancement of power on these scales is nevertheless required for the resulting
distortions to be detectable by future experiments like PIXIE. In this paper, we examine all 49 single-field
inflation models listed by Martin et al. in the Encyclopaedia Inflationaris [1] and find that only
one of these may lead to a detectable level of distortions in a tuned region of its parameter space,
namely the original hybrid model. Three effective multi-field scenarios are also studied: with
softly and suddenly turning trajectories, and with a mild waterfall trajectory. Softly turning
trajectories do not induce distortions at any detectable level, whereas a sudden turn in the field
space or a mild waterfall trajectory predicts a peak (plus damped oscillations in the sudden turn
case) in the scalar power spectrum, which can lead to an observable amount of CMB distortions. Finally,
another scenario leading to potentially detectable distortions involves a curvaton whose blue
spectrum is subdominant on CMB angular scales and overtakes the inflaton spectrum on smaller scales.
In this case however, we show that the bounds from ultra compact minihaloes are not satisfied. Expectations
for an ultimate PRISM-class experiment characterized by an improvement in sensitivity by a factor
of ten are discussed for some models.
