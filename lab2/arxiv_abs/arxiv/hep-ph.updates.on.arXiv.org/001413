Background: The LHCb Collaboration has studied a number of kinematic correlations between $B$-hadron
pairs through their subsequent decays to $J/\psi$ pairs at 7 and 8 TeV for four minimum values of the
$J/\psi$ $p_T$. Purpose: In this work, these measurements are compared to calculations of $b \bar
b$ pairs and their hadronization and inclusive decays to $J/\psi J/\psi$ are compared to the same
observables. Potential cold matter effects on the $b \bar b$ pair observables are discussed to determine
which are most likely to provide insights about the system and why. Methods: The calculations, employing
the exclusive HVQMNR code, assume the same intrinsic $k_T$-broadening and fragmentation as in
[R. Vogt, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 98} (2018) 034907]. The pair distributions presented by LHCb are calculated
in this approach, both for the parent $b \bar b$ and the $J/\psi J/\psi$ pairs produced in their decay.
The sensitivity of the results to the intrinsic $k_T$ broadening is shown. The theoretical uncertainties
due to the $b$ quark mass and scale variations on both the initial $b \bar b$ pairs and the resulting
$J/\psi$ pairs are also shown. Possible effects due to the presence of the nucleus are studied by
increasing the size of the $k_T$ broadening and modification of the fragmentation parameter. Results:
Good agreement with the LHCb data is found for all observables. The parent $b \bar b$ distributions
are more sensitive to the $k_T$ broadening than are the final-state $J/\psi$ pairs. Conclusions:
Next-to-leading order calculations with $k_T$ broadening, as in [R. Vogt, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 98}
(2018) 034907], can describe all correlated observables. Multiple measurements of correlated
observables are sensitive to different nuclear effects which can help distinguish between them.
