The effect of the linear polarization of gluons on the transverse momentum distribution in Higgs
production is studied within the framework of TMD factorization. For this purpose we consider the
TMD evolution for general colorless scalar boson production, from the lower mass $C$-even scalar
quarkonium states $\chi_{c0}$ and $\chi_{b0}$ to the Higgs mass scale. In the absence of an intrinsic
nonperturbative linearly polarized gluon distribution the results agree with the CSS formalism,
indicating a rather rapid decrease with increasing energy scale. At the Higgs mass scale the contribution
from linearly polarized gluons is in this case found to be well below the percent level, in agreement
with an earlier finding in the literature. At the lower mass scale of quarkonium states $\chi_{c0}$
and $\chi_{b0}$ we find contributions at the 5-10% level, albeit with considerable uncertainty.
In the presence of an intrinsic linear gluon polarization, percent level effects are found at the
Higgs mass scale, as well as a considerably slower evolution. Although these results were obtained
using a model for the TMDs that are approximately Gaussian at small transverse momenta and have the
correct perturbative power law fall off at large transverse momenta, it illustrates well the difference
that can exist between results obtained from a TMD formalism as compared to a CSS formalism. The behavior
of the TMDs at small $p_T$ can enhance the results for all transverse momenta of the produced boson,
even for a particle as heavy as the Higgs. The TMD evolution from $\chi_{c0}$ to $\chi_{b0}$ may be
used to constrain the nonperturbative contributions and improve on the prediction of the effect
at the Higgs mass scale.
