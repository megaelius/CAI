The DUNE near detector will collect an unprecedented large number of neutrino interactions, allowing
the precise measurement of rare processes such as neutrino trident production, i.e. the generation
of a lepton-antilepton pair through the scattering of a neutrino off a heavy nucleus. The event rate
of this process is a powerful probe to a well-motivated parameter space of new physics beyond the
Standard Model. In this paper, we perform a detailed sensitivity study of the DUNE near detector
to neutrino tridents. We provide state-of-the-art predictions for the Standard Model cross sections
and corresponding event rates at the near detector for the nu_mu -> nu_mu mu^+ mu^-, nu_mu -> nu_mu
e^+e^- and nu_mu -> nu_e e^+ mu^- trident interactions (and the corresponding anti-neutrino modes),
discussing their uncertainties. We analyze all relevant backgrounds, utilize a Geant4-based
simulation of the DUNE-near detector liquid argon TPC (the official DUNE simulation at the time
of writing this paper), and identify a set of selection cuts that would allow the DUNE near detector
to measure the nu_mu -> nu_mu mu^+ mu^- cross section with a ~25% accuracy after running in neutrino
and anti-neutrino modes for ~3 years each. This would lead to the most precise measurement of the
trident process, surpassing the previous measurement by the CCFR collaboration. We show that this
measurement would be highly sensitive to new physics, and, in particular, we find that the parameter
space of models with gauged L_mu - L_tau that can explain the (g-2)_mu anomaly could be covered almost
entirely. As a byproduct, a new Monte Carlo tool to generate neutrino trident events is made publicly
available.
