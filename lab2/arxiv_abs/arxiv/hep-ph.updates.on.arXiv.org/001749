We present a novel scenario, in which light (mass $\sim$ few \rm{eV}) sterile neutrinos interact
with a dynamical scalar field and for some duration prior to matter-radiation equality (MRE), the
neutrino-scalar fluid behaves like early dark energy (EDE) as the field adiabatically stays at
minimum of effective potential. In this scenario, when (sterile) neutrino becomes non-relativistic
before MRE, we show that, neutrino-scalar fluid develops instability in perturbations followed
by formation of neutrino-nuggets which redshifts like cold dark matter. The sterile fermions get
trapped in nuggets of degenerate matter that are stable over cosmological timescales. As the scalar
field adiabaticaly relaxes into the minimum of an effective potential of neutrino-scalar interaction,
the early dark energy behaviour of the neutrino-scalar fluid increases the local Hubble expansion
rate and relaxes Hubble anomaly. As neutrino mass scale is comparable to MRE temperature, the duration
and scale of this early DE happens naturally prior to recombination. As it goes through an intermediate
phase of nugget formation, we find that our model does not worsen $S_8$ tension. As soon as the nugget
forms, the neutrinos decouple from the scalar field and the combined fluids no longer behave like
EDE, thus escaping the constraints from late time cosmology. The stability of the dark matter nugget
is achieved when the Fermi pressure balances the attractive scalar force and we numerically find
the mass and radius of nuggets by solving the static configuration. We also show that the nugget lifetime
can be easily greater than the age of the Universe.
