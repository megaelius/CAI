In this article we report on our results about the computation of the elliptic flow of the quark-gluon-plasma
produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions, simulating the expansion of the fireball by solving
the relativistic Boltzmann equation for the parton distribution function tuned at a fixed shear
viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$. Our main goal is to put emphasis on the role of a saturation
scale in the initial gluon spectrum, which makes the initial distribution far from a thermalized
one. We find that the presence of the saturation scale reduces the efficiency in building-up the
elliptic flow, even if the thermalization process is quite fast $\tau_{therm} \approx 0.8 \,\rm
fm/c$ and the pressure isotropization even faster $\tau_{isotr} \approx 0.3 \,\rm fm/c$. The impact
of the non-equilibrium implied by the saturation scale manifests for non-central collisions and
can modify the estimate of the viscosity respect to the assumption of full thermalization in $p_T$-space.
We find that the estimate of $\eta/s$ is modified from $\eta/s \approx 2/4\pi$ to $\eta/s \approx
1/4\pi$ at RHIC and from $\eta/s \approx 3/4\pi$ to $\eta/s \approx 2/4\pi$ at LHC. We complete our
investigation by a study of the thermalization and isotropization times of the fireball for different
initial conditions and values of $\eta/s$ showing how the latter affects both isotropization and
thermalization. Lastly, we have seen that the range of values explored by the phase-space distribution
function $f$ is such that at $p_T<0.5\, \rm GeV$ the inner part of the fireball stays with occupation
number significantly larger than unity despite the fast longitudinal expansion, which might suggest
the possibility of the formation of a transient Bose-Einstein Condensate.
