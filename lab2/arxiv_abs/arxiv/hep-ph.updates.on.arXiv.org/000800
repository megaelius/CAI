Understanding the nature of the Dark Matter (DM) is one of the current challenges in modern astrophysics
and cosmology. Knowing the properties of the DM particle would shed light on physics beyond the Standard
Model and even provide us with details of the early Universe. In fact, the detection of such a relic
would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) period, an epoch from which
we have no data, and could even hint at inflationary physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion
rate of the Universe after inflationary is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field $\phi$,
in the so-called "kination" model. We assume that the $\phi$ field decays into both radiation and
DM particles, which we take to be Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The present abundance
of WIMPs is then fixed during the kination period through either a thermal "freeze-out" or "freeze-in"
mechanism, or through a non-thermal process governed by the decay of $\phi$. We explore the parameter
space of this theory with the requirement that the present WIMP abundance provides the correct DM
relic budget. Requiring that BBN occurs during the standard cosmological scenario sets a limit
on the temperature at which the kination period ends. Using this limit and assuming the WIMP has a
mass $m_\chi = 100\,$GeV, we obtain that the thermally-averaged WIMP annihilation cross section
has to satisfy the constraints $4 \times 10^{-16}{\rm \,GeV^{-2}} \lesssim \langle\sigma v\rangle
\lesssim 2\times 10^{-5} {\rm \,GeV^{-2}}$ in order for having at least one of the production mechanism
to yield the observed amount of DM. This result shows how the properties of the WIMP particle, if ever
measured, can yield information on the pre-BBN content of the Universe.
