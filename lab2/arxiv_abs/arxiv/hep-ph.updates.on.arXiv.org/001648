We present a comprehensive discussion on lattice techniques for the simulation of scalar and gauge
field dynamics in an expanding universe. After reviewing the continuum formulation of scalar and
gauge field interactions in Minkowski and FLRW backgrounds, we introduce basic tools for the discretization
of field theories, including lattice gauge invariant techniques. Following, we discuss and classify
numerical algorithms, ranging from methods of $O(dt^2)$ accuracy like $staggered~leapfrog$
and $Verlet$ integration, to $Runge-Kutta$ methods up to $O(dt^4)$ accuracy, and the $Yoshida$
and $Gauss-Legendre$ higher-order integrators, accurate up to $O(dt^{10})$. We adapt these methods
for their use in classical lattice simulations of the non-linear dynamics of scalar and gauge fields
in an expanding grid in $3+1$ dimensions, including the case of `self-consistent' expansion sourced
by the volume average of the fields' energy and pressure densities. We present lattice formulations
of canonical cases of: $i)$ Interacting scalar fields, $ii)$ Abelian $U(1)$ gauge theories, and
$iii)$ Non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In all three cases we provide symplectic integrators,
with accuracy ranging from $O(dt^2)$ up to $O(dt^{10})$. For each algorithm we provide the form
of relevant observables, such as energy density components, field spectra and the Hubble constraint.
We note that all our algorithms for gauge theories always respect the Gauss constraint to machine
precision, even in the case of 'self-consistent' expansion. As a numerical example we analyze the
post-inflationary dynamics of an oscillating inflaton charged under $SU(2)\times U(1)$. We note
that the present manuscript is meant as part of the theoretical basis for the code $CosmoLattice$,
a multi-purpose MPI-based package for simulating the non-linear evolution of field theories in
an expanding universe, to be released in 2020.
