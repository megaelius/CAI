The thesis contains studies of properties quark-gluon plasma, using some non-perturbative techniques.
It contains a brief introduction of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and discussion on various signatures
along with a motivation for this thesis work. It presents the basic mathematical tools and ingredients
required for the thesis, i.e. basics of QCD, Imaginary and Real Time Formalism, Hard Thermal Loop
perturbation theory (HTLpt), Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ) action, the Correlation Function along with
the Spectral Function and Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and QCD in magnetized medium. OPE is
used to compute the dilepton rate in intermediate mass range by incorporating the non-perturbative
dynamics of QCD through the inclusion of non-vanishing quark and gluon condensates in combination
with the Green functions in momentum space. Also the magnetic scale (g^2T) in the HTL perturbation
theory, related to the confining properties of the QCD is taken into account using the GZ action through
a mass parameter, which reflects a new space-like quark mode in the collective excitation. The impact
of this new exciting mode on the DPR has been studied and its important consequences has been discussed.
A hot magnetized medium introduces another scale in the system in addition to temperature. Electromagnetic
spectral properties and DPR are studied completely analytically in presence of both strong and
weak background magnetic fields at finite temperature. The Debye screening in a hot and magnetized
medium has been studied which reveals some of the intriguing properties of the medium in presence
of both strong and weak magnetic field. Also an important quantity that characterizes the QGP, namely
quark number susceptibility has been investigated. Most of the non-perturbative results discussed
in this thesis are compared with those of perturbative ones and lattice QCD.
