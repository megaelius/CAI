My dissertation is about the formulation and application of anisotropic hydrodynamics as a successful
non-equilibrium hydrodynamics model for studying the QGP. For this purpose, I introduce the basic
conformal anisotropic hydrodynamics formalism and then explain the ways we included realistic
features (bulk degree of freedom, quasiparticle implementation of realistic equation of state,
more realistic collisional kernel), to make it a suitable hydrodynamics model for studying the
QGP generated in heavy-ion collisions. For verification of our model we have compared the evolution
of model parameters predicted by aHydro and vHydro, with exact solution of the Boltzmann equation.
However, the system is not conformal and the aHydro needed to be improved to include a realistic prescription
for the equation of state which takes care of non-ideal effect in the dynamics. I have then designed
a novel method for implementing the realistic equation of state (provided by lattice QCD) in the
aHydro formalism. This model, called the quasiparticle aHydro model, integrates the non-conformal
effects in the aHydro model. The non-conformal effects are due to strong interactions of plasma
constituents which leads to temperature-dependence of the particles' effective mass in the system.
Based on the quasiparticle picture, we have developed the quasiparticle aHydro (aHydroQP) model.
We have then compared the phenomenological predictions of the aHydroQP model with experimental
observations. Comparisons illustrate a high level of consistency between our model and the experimental
data. Finally, I have calculated the quark self-energy in an anisotropic QGP. The quark self-energy
is important because it encodes the way quarks gain interactional mass while in the hot QGP. I also
have presented the calculation of gluon self-energy in hard loop approximation in an anisotropic
QGP.
