We conduct a numerical study over the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), Next-to-MSSM (NMSSM) and $U(1)$
extended MSSM (UMSSM) to probe the allowed mass ranges of the charged Higgs boson and its dominant
decay patterns, which might come into prominence in near future collider experiments. {We present
results obtained from a limited scan for CMSSM} as a basis and compare its predictions with the extended
models. We observe within our data that a wide mass range is allowed as $0.5(1) \lesssim m_{H^{\pm}}
\lesssim 17$ TeV in UMSSM (NMSSM). We find that the dominant decay channel is mostly $H^{\pm}\rightarrow
tb$ such that ${\rm BR}(H^{\pm}\rightarrow tb) \sim 80\%$. While this mode remains dominant over
the whole allowed parameter space of CMSSM, we realize some special domains in the NMSSM and UMSSM,
in which ${\rm BR}(H^{\pm}\rightarrow tb) \lesssim 10\%$. In this context, the decay patterns
of the charged Higgs can play a significant role to distinguish among the SUSY models. In addition
to the $tb$ decay mode, we find that the narrow mass scale in CMSSM allows only the decay modes for the
charged Higgs boson to $\tau\nu$ ($\sim 16\%$), and their supersymmetric partners $\tilde{\tau}\tilde{\nu}$
($\sim 13\%$). On the other hand, it is possible to realize the mode in NMSSM and UMSSM in which the
charged Higgs boson decays into a chargino and neutralino pair up to about $25\%$. {This decay mode
requires non-universal boundary conditions within the MSSM framework to be available, since CMSSM
yields ${\rm BR} (H^{\pm}\rightarrow \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}) \lesssim
1\%$.} It can also be probed in near future collider experiments through the missing energy and CP-violation
measurements...
