We analyze a model for the Higgs sector with two scalar doublets and a softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry.
One of the doublets breaks the electroweak symmetry and has tree-level Yukawa couplings to fermions.
The other doublet has no vacuum expectation value and no tree-level couplings to fermions. Because
the $Z_2$ parity is broken the two doublets can mix, which leads to a distinct and novel phenomenology.
This Stealth Doublet Model can be seen as a generalization of the Inert Doublet Model with a broken
$Z_2$ symmetry. We outline the model and present constraints from theory, electroweak precision
tests and collider searches, including the recent observation of a Higgs boson at the LHC. The CP-odd
scalar $A$ and the charged scalar $H^\pm$ couple to fermions at one-loop level. We compute the decays
of $A$ and $H^\pm$ and in particular the one-loop decays $A \to f \bar{f}$, $H^\pm \to f \bar{f}^\prime
$, $H^\pm \to W^\pm Z $ and $H^\pm \to W^\pm \gamma$. We also describe how to calculate and renormalize
such processes in our model. We find that if one of $H^\pm$ or $A$ is the lightest scalar, $H^\pm \to
W^\pm \gamma$ or $ A \to b \bar{b} $ are typically their respective dominating decay channels. Otherwise,
the dominating decays of $H^\pm$ and $A$ are into a scalar and a vector. Due to the absence of tree-level
fermion couplings for $H^\pm$ and $A$, we consider pair production and associated production with
vector bosons and scalars at the LHC. If the parameter space of the model that favors $H^\pm \to W^\pm
\gamma$ is realized in Nature, we estimate that there should be a considerable amount of such events
in the present LHC data.
