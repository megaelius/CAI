Current neutrino experiments measure the neutrino mixing parameters with an unprecedented accuracy.
The upcoming generation of experiments will be sensitive to subdominant effects that can give information
on the unknown neutrino parameters: the Dirac CP-violating phase, the mass ordering and the $\theta_{23}$
octant. Determining the exact values of neutrino mass and mixing parameters is crucial to test neutrino
models and flavor symmetries. In the first part of this review, we summarize the current status of
neutrino oscillation parameters. We consider the most recent data from solar experiments and the
atmospheric data from Super-Kamiokande, IceCube and ANTARES. We implement the data from the reactor
experiments KamLAND, Daya Bay, RENO and Double Chooz as well as the long baseline data from MINOS,
T2K and NOvA. If in addition to the standard interactions, neutrinos have subdominant Non-Standard
Interactions (NSI) with matter, extracting the values of these parameters will suffer from new
degeneracies. We review such effects and formulate the conditions on the NSI parameters under which
the precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters can be distorted. Like standard
weak interactions, NSI can be categorized into Charged and Neutral Current NSI. Our focus will be
on NC NSI since it is possible to build a class of models giving rise to sizeable NC NSI with effects
on neutrino oscillations. These models are based on new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry with a boson of mass
$\lesssim 10$ MeV. The UV complete model should be electroweak invariant which implies that along
with neutrinos, charged fermions acquire new interactions on which there are strong bounds. We
enumerate the bounds that exist on such models and show that it is possible to build viable models
avoiding all the bounds. We review methods to test these models and suggest approaches to break the
degeneracies caused by NSI.
