The LHCb collaboration has recently observed three pentaquark peaks, the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$
and $P_c(4457)$. They are very close to a pair of heavy baryon-meson thresholds, with the $P_c(4312)$
located $8.9\,{\rm MeV}$ below the $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ threshold, and the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$
located $21.8$ and $4.8\,{\rm MeV}$ below the $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ one. The spin-parities of these
three states have not been measured yet. In this work we assume that the $P_c(4312)$ is a $J^P = \tfrac{1}{2}^{-}$
$\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ bound state, while the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ are $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$
bound states of unknown spin-parity, where we notice that the consistent description of the three
pentaquarks in the one-boson-exchange model can indeed determine the spin and parities of the later,
i.e. of the two $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ molecular candidates. For this determination we revisit first
the one-boson-exchange model, which in its original formulation contains a short-range delta-like
contribution in the spin-spin component of the potential. We argue that it is better to remove these
delta-like contributions because, in this way, the one-boson-exchange potential will comply
with the naive expectation that the form factors should not have a significant impact in the long-range
part of the potential (in particular the one-pion-exchange part). Once this is done, we find that
it is possible to consistently describe the three pentaquarks, to the point that the $P_c(4440)$
and $P_c(4457)$ can be predicted from the $P_c(4312)$ within a couple of MeV with respect to their
experimental location. In addition the so-constructed one-boson-exchange model predicts the
preferred quantum numbers of the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ molecular pentaquarks to be $\tfrac{3}{2}^-$
and $\tfrac{1}{2}^-$, respectively.
