The search for additional Higgs particles and the exact measurements of Higgs (self-) couplings
is a major goal of future collider experiments. In this paper we investigate the possible sizes of
new physics signals in these searches in the context of the $CP$-conserving two-Higgs doublet model
of type II. Using current constraints from flavour, electroweak precision, and Higgs signal strength
data, we determine the allowed sizes of the triple Higgs couplings and the branching fractions of
the heavy Higgs bosons into lighter Higgs bosons. Identifying the observed Higgs resonance with
the light $CP$-even 2HDM Higgs boson $h$, we find that the $hhh$ coupling cannot exceed its SM value,
but can be reduced by a factor of $0.56$ at the 2 $\sigma$ level. The branching fractions of the heavy
neutral Higgs bosons $H$ and $A$ into two-fermion or two-vector-boson final states can be reduced
by factors of $0.4$ and $0.01$, respectively, if decays into lighter Higgs boson are possible and
if the mass of the decaying Higgs is below the $t\bar t$ threshold. To facilitate future studies of
collider signatures in 2HDM scenarios with large triple Higgs couplings or decay modes of the heavy
Higgs bosons not covered by the SM Higgs searches we provide a set of benchmark points which exhibit
these features and agree with all current constraints. We also discuss the effect of the heavy Higgs
bosons on the $gg\to hh$ cross section at a 14 TeV LHC for some of these benchmarks. For $m_H$ below
the $hh$ threshold we see a reduction of the SM $gg\to hh$ cross section due to destructive interference,
but for $m_H$ above the $hh$ threshold current constraints allow enhancement factors above 50.
An enhancement factor of 6 is still possible in scenarios in which the heavy Higgs particles would
not be discovered by standard searches after 300 fb${}^{-1}$ of data.
