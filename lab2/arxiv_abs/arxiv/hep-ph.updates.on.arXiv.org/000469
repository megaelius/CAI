Proton-philic spin-dependent inelastic Dark Matter is a Weakly Inelastic Massive Particle scenario
that can explain the DAMA yearly modulation effect in compliance with the constraints from other
direct detection Dark Matter searches. We obtain updated ranges for its parameters both in a halo-independent
approach and adopting a truncated Maxwellian for the WIMP velocity distribution constructing
approximate frequentist confidence intervals from an effective chi-square including, among
others, the latest experimental constraints from XENON1T, PANDAX-II, SuperCDMS and CDMSlite.
In the halo-independent analysis we have implemented the dependence on the WIMP velocity distribution
through a step-wise parameterization of the halo function. For the calculation of the profile likelihood
we used a Markov Chain Montecarlo generator that required a large number of evaluations of the expected
rates. To reduce computational time we introduced expected rates expressions suitable for a fast
evaluation through tabulation and interpolation. Our frequentist analysis confirms the present
viability of the pSIDM scenario as a possible explanation of the DAMA effect. In terms of the WIMP
mass $m_{\chi}$ and of the mass splitting $\delta$ we find the 1-sigma ranges $\mbox{12.5 GeV} \le
m_{\chi}\le \mbox{15.7 GeV}$, $\mbox{22.1 keV} \le \delta \le \mbox{26.1 keV}$ for the halo--independent
analysis and $\mbox{11.4 GeV} \le m_{\chi}\le \mbox{13.6 GeV}$, $\mbox{24.4 keV} \le \delta \le
\mbox{27.0 keV}$ for the Maxwellian case. We find that a full year of data taking of XENON1T should
allow to start probing the pSIDM scenario.
