We elaborate further on the compatibility of the ``vacuumon potential '' that characterises the
inflationary phase of the Running Vacuum Model (RVM) with the Swampland criteria. The work is motivated
by the fact that, as demonstrated recently by the authors [1-3], the RVM framework can be derived
as an effective gravitational field theory stemming from underlying microscopic (critical) string
theory models with gravitational anomalies, involving condensation of primordial gravitational
waves. Although believed to be a classical scalar field description, not representing a fully fledged
quantum field, nonetheless we show here that the vacuumon potential satisfies certain Swampland
criteria for the relevant regime of parameters and field range. We link the criteria to the Gibbons-Hawking
entropy that has been argued to characterise the RVM during the de Sitter phase. These results imply
that the vacuumon may, after all, admit under certain conditions, a r\^ole as a quantum field during
the inflationary (almost de Sitter) phase of the running vacuum. The conventional slow-roll interpretation
of this field, however, fails just because it satisfies the Swampland criteria. The RVM effective
theory derived from the low-energy effective action of string theory does, however, successfully
describe inflation thanks to the $\sim H^4$ terms induced by the gravitational anomalous condensates.
In addition, the stringy version of the RVM involves the Kalb-Ramond (KR) axion field, which, in
contrast to the vacuumon, does perfectly satisfy the slow-roll condition. We conclude that the
vacuumon description is not fully equivalent to the stringy formulation of the RVM.
