In this master's thesis, the minimal dark matter models with radiative neutrino masses introduced
in arXiv:1308.3655 are examined both in general and, using the model T1-3-B ($\alpha = 0$) as a representative,
in more detail. In the process, it is both shown how such models are built and a numerical analysis
tool chain is established, automating as many steps as possible from the very beginning (deriving
the Lagrangian from a given field content) to the very end (calculating observables such as the dark
matter relic density, the direct detection cross section and the neutrino masses and mixing matrices).
As an important result in laying out the mathematical groundwork, a convention for representations
of SU(2) is established which, in this form, is not found in previous works. Another major result
is the development of the program minimal-lagrangians, whose capabilities are described in the
thesis. It is of great use both for the construction of Lagrangians for new models as well their verification
or quick surveys. minimal-lagrangians can be applied to any model within the class it is designed
to handle, extending its utility far beyond a one-time result that is only obtained for a single model.
Finally, the first steps in the analysis of the model T1-3-B ($\alpha = 0$) are taken. It is shown that
the model can reproduce both the singlet-doublet fermion dark matter model and the inert triplet
model in the appropriate limits. Moreover, the neutrino mass matrix is found and it is demonstrated
that the model can accommodate current constraints on the neutrino masses. Lastly, the behavior
of the dark matter relic density as it depends on the parameter responsible for the generation of
neutrino masses is investigated. Further in-depth study of the model T1-3-B ($\alpha = 0$) was performed
in a separate publication (arXiv:1812.11133).
