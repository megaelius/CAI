In extended supersymmetric models with a hidden sector the lightest $R$-parity odd particle can
reside in the hidden sector and act as dark matter. We consider the case when the hidden sector has
ultraweak interactions with the visible sector. An interesting phenomenon arises if the LSP of
the visible sector is charged in which case it will decay to the hidden sector dark matter. Due to the
ultraweak interactions, the LSP of the visible sector will be long-lived decaying outside the detector
after leaving a track inside. We investigate this possibility in the framework of a $U(1)_X$-extended
MSSM/SUGRA model with a small gauge kinetic mixing and mass mixing between the $U(1)_X$ and $U(1)_Y$
where $U(1)_Y$ is the gauge group of the hypercharge. Specifically we investigate the case when
the LSP of MSSM is a stop which decays into the hidden sector dark matter and has a lifetime long enough
to traverse the LHC detector without decay. It is shown that such a particle can be detected at the
HL-LHC and HE-LHC as an $R$-hadron which will look like a slow moving muon with a large transverse
momentum $p_T$ and so can be detected by the track it leaves in the inner tracker and in the muon spectrometer.
Further, due to the ultraweak couplings between the hidden sector and the MSSM fields, the dark matter
particle has a relic density arising from a combination of the freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms.
It is found that even for the ultraweak or feeble interactions the freeze-out contribution relative
to freeze-in contribution to the relic density is substantial to dominant, varying between 30\%
to 74\% for the model points considered. It is subdominant to freeze-in for relatively small stop
masses with relatively larger stop annihilation cross-sections and the dominant contribution
to the relic density for relatively large stop masses and relatively smaller stop annihilation
cross-sections.
