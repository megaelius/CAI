The simplicity of the CMB data, so well described by single-field inflation, raises the question
whether there might be an equally simple multi-field realization consistent with the observations.
We explore the idea that an approximate 'angular' shift symmetry in field space (an isometry) protects
the dynamics of coupled inflationary perturbations. This idea relates to the recent observation
that multi-field inflation mimics the predictions of single-field inflation, if the inflaton
is efficiently and constantly coupled to a second massless degree of freedom (the isocurvature
perturbation). In multi-field inflation, the inflationary trajectory is in general not aligned
with the gradient of the potential. As a corollary the potential does not reflect the symmetries
of perturbations. We propose a new method to reconstruct simultaneously a two-field action and
an inflationary trajectory which proceeds along an `angular' direction of field space, with a constant
radius of curvature, and that has a controlled mass of `radial' isocurvature perturbations (entropy
mass). We dub this `Orbital Inflation'. In this set-up the Hubble parameter determines the behavior
of both the background and the perturbations. First, Orbital Inflation provides a playground for
quasi-single field inflation. Second, the exquisite analytical control of these models allows
us to exactly solve the phenomenology of Orbital Inflation with a small entropy mass and a small radius
of curvature, a regime not previously explored. The predictions are single-field-like, although
the consistency relations are violated. Moreover, the value of the entropy mass dictates how the
inflationary predictions fan out in the ($n_s$, $r$) plane. Depending on the size of the self interactions
of the isocurvature perturbations, the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$ can range from slow-roll
suppressed to $\mathcal{O}(\text{a few})$.
