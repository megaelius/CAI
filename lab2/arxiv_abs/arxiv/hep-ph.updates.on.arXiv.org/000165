We consider the contributions of individual new particles to the anomalous magnetic moment of the
muon, utilizing the generic framework of simplified models. We also present analytic results for
all possible one-loop contributions, allowing easy application of these results for more complete
models which predict more than one particle capable of correcting the muon magnetic moment. Additionally,
we provide a Mathematica code to allow the reader straightforwardly compute any 1-loop contribution.
Furthermore, we derive bounds on each new particle considered, assuming either the absence of other
significant contributions to $a_\mu$ or that the anomaly has been resolved by some other mechanism.
In summary we found the following particles capable of explaining the current discrepancy, assuming
unit couplings: $2$TeV ($0.3$TeV) neutral scalar with pure scalar (chiral) couplings, $4$TeV
doubly charged scalar with pure pseudoscalar coupling, $0.3-1$TeV neutral vector boson depending
on what couplings are used (vector, axial, or mixed), $0.5-1$TeV singly-charged vector boson depending
on which couplings are chosen, and $3$TeV doubly-charged vector-coupled bosons. We also derive
the following $1\sigma$ lower bounds on new particle masses assuming unit couplings and that the
experimental anomaly has been otherwise resolved: a doubly charged pseudoscalar must be heavier
than $7$~TeV, a neutral scalar than $3$TeV, a vector-coupled new neutral boson $600$GeV, an axial-coupled
neutral boson $1.5$TeV, a singly-charged vector-coupled $W^\prime$ $1$TeV, a doubly-charged
vector-coupled boson $5$TeV, scalar leptoquarks $10$TeV, and vector leptoquarks $10$TeV.
