We explore the phenomenology of models containing one Vector-Like Quark (VLQ), $t'$, which can
decay into the Standard Model (SM) top quark, $t$, and a new spin-0 neutral boson, $S$, the latter
being either a scalar or pseudoscalar state. We parametrise the underlying interactions in terms
of a simplified model which enables us to capture possible Beyond the SM (BSM) scenarios. We discuss
in particular three such scenarios: one where the SM state is supplemented by an additional scalar,
one which builds upon a 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) framework and another which realises a Composite
Higgs Model (CHM) through partial compositeness. Such exotic decays of the $t'$ can be competitive
with decays into SM particles, leading to new possible discovery channels at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC). Assuming $t'$ pair production via strong interactions, we design signal regions optimised
for one $t'\rightarrow S t$ transition (while being inclusive on the other \bar{t'} decay, and vice
versa), followed by the decay of $S$ into the two very clean experimental signatures $S\rightarrow
\gamma \gamma$ and $S\rightarrow Z(\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-)\gamma$. We perform a dedicated
signal-to-background analysis in both channels, by using Monte Carlo (MC) event simulations modelling
the dynamics from the proton-proton to the detector level. Under the assumption of BR$(t' \rightarrow
S t) = 100\%$, we are therefore able to realistically quantify the sensitivity of the LHC to both the
$t'$ and $S$ masses, assuming both current and foreseen luminosities. This approach paves the way
for the LHC experiments to surpass current VLQ search strategies based solely on $t'$ decays into
SM bosons ($W^\pm, Z$, $h$).
