Heavy neutrinos $(N)$ remain one of most promising explanations for the origin of neutrinos' tiny
masses and large mixing angles. In light of broad advances in understanding and modeling of hadron
collisions at large momentum transfers, we revisit the long-standard search strategy for heavy
$N$ decaying to multiple charged leptons $(\ell)$, $pp \to N\ell X \to 3\ell \nu X$. For electroweak
and TeV-scale $N$, we propose a qualitatively new collider analysis premised on a dynamic jet veto
and discriminating, on an event-by-event basis, according to the relative amount of hadronic and
leptonic activity. We report that the sensitivity to heavy neutrinos at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) can be improved by roughly an order of magnitude over the collider's lifetime. At $\sqrt{s}=14$
TeV with $\mathcal{L}=3~{\rm ab}^{-1}$, we find active-sterile mixing as small as $\vert V_{\ell
N}\vert^2 = 10^{-2} ~(10^{-3})$ can be probed for heavy Dirac neutrinos masses $m_N \lesssim 1200~(300)$
GeV. The improvement holds also for Majorana $N$ and is largely independent of whether charged lepton
flavor is conserved or violated. The analysis, built almost exclusively from inclusive, transverse
observables, is designed to be robust across increasing collider energies, and hence serves as
a basis for searches at future colliders: With $\mathcal{L}=15~{\rm ab}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=27$
TeV, one can probe mixing below $\vert V_{\ell N}\vert^2 = 10^{-2} ~(10^{-3})$ for $m_N \lesssim
3500~(700)$ GeV. At a hypothetical 100 TeV $pp$ collider with $\mathcal{L}=30~{\rm ab}^{-1}$,
one can probe mixing below $10^{-4}$ for $m_N \lesssim 200$ GeV, below $10^{-3}$ for $m_N \lesssim
4$ TeV, and below $10^{-2}$ for $m_N \lesssim 15$ TeV. We anticipate these results can be further
improved with detector-specific tuning and application of multi-variant / machines learning
techniques.
