We implement type-II seesaw dominance for neutrino mass and baryogenesis through heavy scalar
triplet leptogenesis in a class of minimal non-supersymmetric SO(10) models where matter parity
as stabilising discrete symmetry as well as WIMP dark matter (DM) candidates are intrinsic predictions
of the GUT symmetry. We also find modifications of relevant CP-asymmetry formulas in such minimal
models. Baryon asymmetry of the universe as solutions of Boltzmann equations is further shown to
be realized for both normal and inverted mass orderings in concordance with cosmological bound
and best fit values of the neutrino oscillation data including $\theta_{23}$ in the second octant
and large values of leptonic Dirac CP-phases. Type-II seesaw dominance is at first successfully
implemented in two cases of spontaneous SO(10) breakings through SU(5) route where the presence
of only one non-standard Higgs scalar of intermediate mass $\sim 10^9-10^{10}$ GeV achieves unification.
Lower values of the SU(5) unification scales $\sim 10^{15}$ GeV are predicted to bring proton lifetimes
to the accessible ranges of Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. Our prediction
of WIMP DM relic density in each model is due to a $\sim$ TeV mass matter-parity odd real scalar singlet
($\subset {16}_H \subset$ SO(10)) verifiable by LUX and XENON1T experiments. This DM is also noted
to resolve the vacuum stability issue of the standard scalar potential. When applied to the unification
framework of M. Frigerio and T. Hambye, in addition to the minimal fermionic triplet DM solution
of $2.7$ TeV mass, this procedure of type-II seesaw dominance and triplet leptogenesis is also found
to make an alternative prediction of triplet fermion plus real scalar singlet DM at the TeV scale.
