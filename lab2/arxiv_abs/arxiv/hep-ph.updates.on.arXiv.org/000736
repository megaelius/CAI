Recent data from LHC13 by the TOTEM Collaboration have indicated an unexpected decrease in the value
of the $\rho$ parameter and a $\sigma_{tot}$ value in agreement with the trend of previous measurements
at 7 and 8 TeV. These data at 13 TeV are not simultaneously described by the predictions from Pomeron
models selected by the COMPETE Collaboration, but show agreement with the maximal Odderon dominance,
as recently demonstrated by Martynov and Nicolescu. Here we present a detailed analysis on the applicability
of Pomeron dominance by means of a general class of forward scattering amplitude, consisting of
even-under-crossing leading contributions associated with single, double and triple poles in
the complex angular momentum plane. We carry out fits to $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ data in the interval
5 GeV - 13 TeV. The data set comprises all the accelerator data below 7 TeV and we consider two independent
ensembles by adding either only the TOTEM data or TOTEM and ATLAS data at the LHC energy region. In
the data reductions to each ensemble the uncertainty regions are evaluated with both one and two
standard deviation ($\sim$ 68 \% and $\sim$ 95 \% CL, respectively). Besides the general analytic
model, we investigate four particular cases of interest, three of them typical of outstanding models
in the literature. We conclude that, within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties and
both ensembles, the general model and three particular cases are not able to describe the $\sigma_{tot}$
and $\rho$ data at 13 TeV simultaneously. However, if the discrepancies between the TOTEM and ATLAS
data are not resolved, one Pomeron model, associated with double and triple poles and with only 7
free parameters, seems not to be excluded by the complete set of experimental information presently
available.
