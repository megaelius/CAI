Radiatively-driven natural supersymmetry, a theoretically and experimentally well-motivated
framework, centers around the predicted existence of four light, nearly mass-degenerate Higgsinos
with mass $\sim 100-200$ GeV (not too far above $m_Z$). The small mass splittings amongst the higgsinos,
typically 4-20 GeV, results in very little visible energy arising from decays of the heavier higgsinos.
Given that other SUSY particles are considerably heavy, this makes detection challenging at hadron
colliders. On the other hand, the clean environment of an electron-positron collider with $\sqrt{s}>2m_{higgsino}$
would enable a decisive search of these required higgsinos, and thus either the discovery or exclusion
of natural SUSY. We present a detailed simulation study of precision measurements of higgsino masses
and production cross sections at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV of the proposed International Linear Collider
currently under consideration for construction in Japan. The study is based on a Geant4 simulation
of the International Large Detector concept. We examine several benchmark points just beyond the
HL-LHC reach, with four light higgsinos directly accessible by the ILC, and the mass differences
between the lightest SUSY particle and the heavier states ranging from about 4 to 20 GeV. It can be
shown that their masses and production cross sections can be precisely measured to approximately
1\% precision or better. These precise measurements allow for extracting the underlying weak scale
SUSY parameters, giving predictions for the masses of heavier SUSY states. These provide motivation
for future high-energy colliders. Additionally, dark matter properties may be derived. Evolution
of the measured gaugino masses to high energies should allow testing the hypothesis of gaugino mass
unification.
