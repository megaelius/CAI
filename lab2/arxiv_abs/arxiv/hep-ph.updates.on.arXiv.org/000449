We study the prospects of observing the non-resonant di-Higgs pair production in the Standard Model
(SM) at the high luminosity run of the 14 TeV LHC (HL-LHC), upon combining multiple final states chosen
on the basis of their yield and cleanliness. In particular, we consider the $b\bar{b}\gamma \gamma,
b\bar{b} \tau^+ \tau^-, b\bar{b} WW^*, WW^*\gamma \gamma$ and $4W$ channels mostly focusing on
final states with photons and/or leptons and study 11 final states. We employ multivariate analyses
to optimise the discrimination between signal and backgrounds and find it performing better than
simple cut-based analyses. The number of signal events originating from SM di-Higgs production
in each final state is small and for this reason measurement of differential distributions may not
be possible. In order to extract the Higgs quartic coupling, we have to rely on the total number of
events in each final state and these channels can be contaminated by various new physics scenarios.
Furthermore, we consider various physics beyond the standard model scenarios to quantify the effects
of contamination while trying to measure the SM di-Higgs signals in detail. In particular, we study
generic resonant heavy Higgs decays to a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons or to a pair of top quarks, heavy
pseudoscalar decaying to an SM-like Higgs and a $Z$-boson, charged Higgs production in association
with a top and a bottom quark and also various well-motivated supersymmetric channels. We set limits
on the cross-sections for the aforementioned new physics scenarios, above which these can be seen
as excesses over the SM background and affect the measurement of Higgs quartic coupling. We also
discuss the correlations among various channels which can be useful to identify the new physics
model.
