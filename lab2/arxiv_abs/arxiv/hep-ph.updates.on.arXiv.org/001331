Finding the existence and the location of the QCD critical point is one of the main goals of the RHIC
beam energy scan program. To make theoretical predictions and corroborate with the experimental
data requires modelling the space-time evolution of the matter created in heavy-ion collisions
by some dynamical models such as the relativistic hydrodynamics with a proper Equation of State
(EoS). In the present exploratory study, we use a newly developed ideal 2+1 dimensional event-by-event
(e-by-e) hydrodynamic code at finite baryon densities with two different EoSs (i) Lattice QCD +
HRG with a crossover transition and (ii) EoS with a first-order phase transition. The MC Glauber
model is used to initialise the system with two different variants (a) wounded nucleons ($\varepsilon_{WN}$)
and (b) binary collisions ($\varepsilon_{BC}$), for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$
GeV and 62.4 GeV. We found that the correlations $c(v_{2},v_{3})$ and $c(v_{3},v_{4})$ are always
larger for the first-order phase transition than the cross over phase transition irrespective
of the initial conditions. The same correlations were shown to be quite insensitive to the shear
viscosity of the medium in a previous study by Niemi et al \cite{Niemi:2012aj}. This indicates that
these observables can be used to gain information about the QCD EoS from experimental data and can
be used as an EoS meter. Besides, we also found $\sim 10\% -30\%$ difference in $c(\epsilon_{2},
v_{2})$ for the two different EoSs. These observations may be attributed to very different evolutionary
dynamics of the system for the two different EoSs.
