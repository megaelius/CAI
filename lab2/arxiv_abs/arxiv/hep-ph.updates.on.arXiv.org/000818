Volume or centrality fluctuations (CF) is one of the main uncertainties for interpreting the centrality
dependence of many experimental observables. The CF is constrained by centrality selection based
on particle multiplicity in a reference subevent, and contributes to observables measured in another
subevent. Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the influence of CF on several
distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities $\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\epsilon_n)$,
$p(\epsilon_n,\epsilon_m)$ and $p(N,\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using
multi-particle cumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation
is established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the reference subevent.
In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle production sources is strongly distorted,
we find these cumulants exhibit rich sign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity
in the underlying distributions. The details of sign-change pattern change with the size of the
collision systems. Simultaneous comparison of these different types cumulants between model
prediction and experimental data can be used to constrain the CF and particle production mechanism
in heavy-ion collisions. Since the concept of centrality and CF are expected to fluctuate in the
longitudinal direction within a single event, we propose to use pseudorapidity-separated subevent
cumulant method to explore the nature of intra-event fluctuations of centrality and collective
dynamics. The subevent method can be applied for any bulk observable that is sensitive to centrality,
and has the potential to separate different mechanisms for multiplicity and flow fluctuations
happening at different time scales. The forward detector upgrades at RHIC and LHC will greatly enhance
such studies in the future.
