The neutralino dark matter (DM) predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)
has been probed in several search modes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), one of the leading ones
among which is the trilepton plus missing transverse momentum channel. The experimental analysis
of this mode has, however, been designed to probe mainly a bino-like DM, originating in the decays
of a pair of next-to-lightest neutralino and lightest chargino, both of which are assumed to be wino-like.
In this study, we analyse how this trilepton channel can be tuned for probing also the wino-like DM.
We note that, while the mentioned standard production mode generally leads to a relatively poor
sensitivity for the wino-like DM, there are regions in the MSSM parameter space where the net yield
in the trilepton final state can be substantially enhanced at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. This
is achieved by taking into account also an alternative channel, pair-production of the wino-like
DM itself in association with the heavier chargino, and optimisation of the kinematical cuts currently
employed by the LHC collaborations. In particular, we find that the cut on the transverse mass of
the third lepton highly suppresses both the signal channels and should therefore be discarded in
this DM scenario. We perform a detailed detector-level study of some selected parameter space points
that are consistent with the most important experimental constraints, including the recent ones
from the direct and indirect DM detection facilities. Our analysis demonstrates the high complementarity
of the two channels, with their combined significance reaching above 4$\sigma$ for a wino-like
DM mass around 100 GeV, with an integrated luminosity as low as 100 fb$^{-1}$.
