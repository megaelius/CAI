Gravitational-wave echoes in the post-merger signal of a binary coalescence are predicted in various
scenarios, including near-horizon quantum structures, exotic states of matter in ultracompact
stars, and certain deviations from general relativity. The amplitude and frequency of each echo
is modulated by the photon-sphere barrier of the remnant, which acts as a spin- and frequency-dependent
high-pass filter, decreasing the frequency content of each subsequent echo. Furthermore, a major
fraction of the energy of the echo signal is contained in low-frequency resonances corresponding
to the quasi-normal modes of the remnant. Motivated by these features, in this work we provide an
analytical gravitational-wave template in the low-frequency approximation describing the post-merger
ringdown and the echo signal of a spinning ultracompact object. Besides the standard ringdown parameters,
the template is parametrized in terms of only two physical quantities: the reflectivity coefficient
and the compactness of the remnant. We discuss novel effects related to the spin and to the complex
reflectivity, such as a more involved modulation of subsequent echoes, the mixing of two polarizations,
and the ergoregion instability in case of perfectly-reflecting spinning remnants. Finally, we
compute the errors in the estimation of the template parameters with current and future gravitational-wave
detectors using a Fisher matrix framework. Our analysis suggests that models with almost perfect
reflectivity can be excluded/detected with current instruments, whereas probing values of the
reflectivity smaller than $80\%$ at $3\sigma$ confidence level requires future detectors (Einstein
Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, LISA). The template developed in this work can be easily implemented
to perform a matched-filter based search for echoes and to constrain models of exotic compact objects.
