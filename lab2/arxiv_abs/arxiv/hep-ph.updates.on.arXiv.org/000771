The low-energy limit of several string theories feature the "axiverse", a plethora of light axions
with masses spanning various orders of magnitude. Within the simplest picture, the masses of the
resulting axions depend on a hard non-perturbative scale related to the supersymmetry breaking
scale $M_{\rm susy}$, and the dimensionless instanton action $S$ responsible for breaking the
axion shift symmetry. We explore whether these two parameters can be probed using cosmology, taking
into account current limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the primordial isocurvature fraction,
and measurements of the dark matter energy density today. Adopting string-inspired flat priors
on $\log_{10}M_{\rm susy}$ and $S$, and imposing that $M_{\rm susy}$ be sub-Planckian, we find
$S=198\pm28$ at 68\%~C.L., in striking agreement with the theoretical expectation that $S \approx
200$, whereas $M_{\rm susy}$ remains unconstrained. These bounds imply $\log_{10}\left(m_a/{\rm
eV}\right) = -21.5^{+1.3}_{-2.3}$, with $m_a$ the axion mass, suggesting that cosmological data
complemented with string-inspired priors select a quite narrow axion mass range within the axiverse.
In order to break the $M_{\rm susy}$-$S$ degeneracy, we explore the impact of fixing $S=198$ and
$S=153$ (mean and 2$\sigma$ lower limit of $S$). In the latter case we find $M_{\rm susy} \lesssim
8 \times 10^3\,{\rm TeV}$ at 95\%~C.L., potentially leading to interesting signatures at the proposed
100 TeV collider. Performing a final analysis where we instead impose flat priors on $\log_{10}m_a$
and $\log_{10}f_a$, with $f_a$ the axion decay scale, we find $\log_{10} (m_a/{\rm eV}) = -11.1^{+11.5}_{-5.9}$.
This result differs from of our string-inspired analysis because imposing that the supersymmetry
breaking scale lie below the Planck scale leads to a preference for lower axion masses, in agreement
with theoretical results. (abridged)
