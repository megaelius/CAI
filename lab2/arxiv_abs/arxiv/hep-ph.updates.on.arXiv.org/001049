Matter consisting of up, down and strange quarks, socalled Strange Quark Matter, has been hypothesized
to be stable in bulk, and conceivably stable or metastable in finite systems---strangelets---as
an alternative state to ordinary baryonic matter. Strangelets, if they exist, may be relics from
the hot and dense early universe, or they could be produced in high energy events, such as collisions
of heavy nuclei at relativistic speeds. This thesis investigates the implications of various effects
that affects the possible (meta-) stability of strangelets, such as finite size, distribution
of quark states (shell model), interaction with a hadron gas, non-zero temperature and QCD constraints
of color singletness of the wave function. These effects are studied within the phenomenological
MIT bag model of quark matter using the multiple reflection expansion for a liquid drop model equation
of state with comparison to a shell model. Finite size, non-zero temperature and color singlet constraints
have a destabilizing effect on strangelets, and can suppress their production in heavy ion collisions.
