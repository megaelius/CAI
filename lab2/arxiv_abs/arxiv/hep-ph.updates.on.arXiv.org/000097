Experimental data measured in sqrt(s)=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC show a significant enhancement
of events with an unbalanced pair of reconstructed jet momenta in comparison with p+p collisions.
This enhancement of momentum imbalance is caused by different momentum loss of the initial back-to-back
di-partons by scatterings within the created dense medium. For investigating the underlying partonic
momentum loss we extended the on-shell transport model BAMPS (Boltzmann Approach for Multi-Parton
Scattering) for full heavy-ion collisions, which numerically solves the 3+1D Boltzmann equation
based on 2->2 as well as 2<->3 scattering processes, with the possibility of virtual initial
partonic branching processes for jet particles. Due to the employed test-particle approach jet
reconstruction within BAMPS events is not trivial. We introduce a method that nevertheless allows
the microscopic simulation of the full evolution of both the shower particles and the underlying
bulk medium in one common microscopic framework. With this method it is for the first time possible
to use well-established experimental subtraction algorithms within a theoretical calculation.
Furthermore, we investigate the influence of multiple in-medium scattering processes of the shower
partons on the momentum imbalance A_J. Due to the available particle information in configuration
as well as momentum space within BAMPS, it is possible to reproduce the entire evolution of the reconstructed
jets within the medium. With this information we investigate the dependence of the jet momentum
loss from the difference in the partonic in-medium path lengths.
