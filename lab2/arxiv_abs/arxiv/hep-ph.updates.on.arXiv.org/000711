We study the prospects of observing the non-resonant di-Higgs pair production in the Standard Model
(SM) at the high luminosity run of the 14 TeV LHC (HL-LHC), upon combining multiple final states chosen
on the basis of their yield and cleanliness. In particular, we consider the $b\bar{b}\gamma \gamma,
b\bar{b} \tau^+ \tau^-, b\bar{b} WW^*, WW^*\gamma \gamma$ and $4W$ channels mostly focusing on
final states with photons and/or leptons and study 11 final states. We employ multivariate analyses
to optimise the discrimination between signal and backgrounds and find it performing better than
simple cut-based analyses. The various differential distributions for the Higgs pair production
have non-trivial dependencies on the Higgs self-coupling ($\lambda_{hhh}$). We thus explore
the implications of varying $\lambda_{hhh}$ for the most sensitive search channel for the double
Higgs production, \textit{viz.}, $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$. The number of signal events originating
from SM di-Higgs production in each final state is small and for this reason measurement of differential
distributions may not be possible. Furthermore, we consider various physics beyond the standard
model scenarios to quantify the effects of contamination while trying to measure the SM di-Higgs
signals in detail. In particular, we study generic resonant heavy Higgs decays to a pair of SM-like
Higgs bosons or to a pair of top quarks, heavy pseudoscalar decaying to an SM-like Higgs and a $Z$-boson,
charged Higgs production in association with a top and a bottom quark and also various well-motivated
supersymmetric channels. We set limits on the cross-sections for the aforementioned new physics
scenarios, above which these can be seen as excesses over the SM background and affect the measurement
of Higgs quartic coupling. We also discuss the correlations among various channels which can be
useful to identify the new physics model.
