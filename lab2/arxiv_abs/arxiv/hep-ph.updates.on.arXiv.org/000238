We study CP-conserving rare flavor violating processes in the recently proposed theory of Maximally
Natural Supersymmetry (MNSUSY). MNSUSY is an unusual supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the Standard
Model (SM) which, remarkably, is un-tuned at present LHC limits. It employs Scherk-Schwarz breaking
of SUSY by boundary conditions upon compactifying an underlying 5-dimensional (5D) theory down
to 4D, and is not well-described by softly-broken $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY, with much different phenomenology
than the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its variants. The usual CP-conserving
SUSY-flavor problem is automatically solved in MNSUSY due to a residual almost exact $U(1)_R$ symmetry,
naturally heavy and highly degenerate 1st- and 2nd-generation sfermions, and heavy gauginos and
Higgsinos. Depending on the exact implementation of MNSUSY there exist important new sources of
flavor violation involving gauge boson Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. The spatial localization
properties of the matter multiplets, in particular the brane localization of the 3rd generation
states, imply KK-parity is broken and {\it tree-level} contributions to flavor changing neutral
currents are present in general. Nevertheless, we show that simple variants of the basic MNSUSY
model are safe from present flavor constraints arising from kaon and $B$-meson oscillations, the
rare decays $B_{s,d} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\mu \to {\bar e}ee$ and $\mu$-$e$ conversion in nuclei.
We also briefly discuss some special features of the radiative decays $\mu \to e \gamma$ and ${\bar
B}\to X_s \gamma$. Future experiments, especially those concerned with lepton flavor violation,
should see deviations from SM predictions unless one of the MNSUSY variants with enhanced flavor
symmetries is realized.
