The process of electron-positron annihilation into two photons in the presence of an intense classical
plane wave of an arbitrary shape is investigated analytically by employing light-cone quantization
and by taking into account the effects of the plane wave exactly. We introduce a general description
of second-order 2-to-2 scattering processes in a plane-wave background field, indicating the
necessity of considering the localization of the colliding particles, and that is achieved by means
of wave packets. We define a local cross section in the background field, which generalizes the vacuum
cross section and which, though not being directly an observable, allows for a comparison between
the results in the plane wave and in vacuum without relying on the shape of the incoming wave packets.
Two possible cascade or two-step channels have been identified in the annihilation process and
an alternative way of representing the two-step and one-step contributions via a "virtuality"
integral has been found. Finally, we compute the total local cross section to leading order in the
coupling between the electron-positron field and the quantized photon field, excluding the interference
between the two leading-order diagrams arising from the exchange of the two final photons, and express
it in a relatively compact form, which contains the dependence on the plane-wave field only via the
dressed fermion momenta. In contrast to processes in a background field initiated by a single particle,
the pair annihilation into two photons, in fact, also occurs in vacuum. Our result naturally embeds
the vacuum part and reduces to the vacuum expression, known in the literature, in the case of a vanishing
laser field.
