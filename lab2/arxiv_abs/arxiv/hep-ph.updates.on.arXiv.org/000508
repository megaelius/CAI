We construct an effective theory for the SM with extra dimensions. We start from a theory governed
by the extra-dimensional groups ISO$(1,3+n)$ and $G_{\rm SM}({\cal M}^{4+n})=SU_C(3,{\cal
M}^{4+n})\times SU_L(2,{\cal M}^{4+n})\times U_Y(1,{\cal M}^{4+n})$, characterized by an
unknown energy scale $\Lambda$ and valid at energies far below this scale. Assuming that the extra
dimensions are much larger than the distance scale of this theory, we construct an effective theory
with symmetry groups ISO(1,3), $G_{\rm SM}({\cal M}^{4})$. The theories are connected by a canonical
transformation that hides ISO$(1,3+n)$, $G_{\rm SM}({\cal M}^{4+n})$ into ISO(1,3), $G_{\rm
SM}({\cal M}^{4})$; KK fields receive mass. Using a set of orthogonal functions $\{f^{(\underline{0})},f^{(\underline{m})}\}$,
generated by the Casimir invariant $\bar{P}^2$ associated with the translations subgroup $T(n)\subset$ISO$(n)$,
we expand the degrees of freedom of ISO$(1,3+n)$, $G_{\rm SM}({\cal M}^{4+n})$ in general Fourier
series, whose coefficients are the degrees of freedom of ISO(1,3), $G({\cal M}^{4})$. These functions,
which correspond to the projection on $\{|\bar{x}\big>\}$ of the discrete basis $\{|0\big>,|p^{(\underline{m})}\big>\}$
of $\bar{P}^2$, are central to define the effective theory. Components along the ground state $f^{(\underline{0})}=\big
<\bar x|0\big>$ do not receive mass at the compactification scale, so they are the SM fields; components
along excited states $f^{(\underline{m})}=\big<\bar x|p^{(\underline{m})}\big>$ get mass
at this scale, so they are KK excitations. For any direction $|p^{(\underline{m})}\neq0\big>$
there are a massive gauge field and a pseudo-Goldstone boson. We stress resemblances of this mass-generating
mechanism with the Englert-Higgs mechanism and discuss physical implications. We include a full
catalog of Lagrangian terms that can be used to calculate Feynman rules.
