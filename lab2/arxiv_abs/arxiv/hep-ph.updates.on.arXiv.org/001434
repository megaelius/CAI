In Supersymmetry deviations from the SM signal strengths of the 125 GeV Higgs boson can occur, because
of possible SUSY contributions in diagrams with loops, which leads to different deviations in signal
strengths for processes with and without loop diagrams. In the Next-to Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (NMSSM) additional deviations may occur, because of the mixing with the additional
singlet-like Higgs boson and/or additional decays into pairs of light particles, like neutralinos,
pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons or singlet-like Higgs bosons. In this paper we study these "genuine"
NMSSM deviations in detail to check not only their possible size, but also look for correlations
or anti-correlations with respect to other channels in the hope to find specific patterns in the
deviations as for the SUSY contributions, which occur predominantly in processes including loops
in the diagrams. The whole NMSSM parameter space is sampled in a deterministic way. The novel scanning
method is discussed in detail in the Appendix. We found three different regions with "genuine" NMSSM
deviations, which are largely independent of the production mode. What was surprising: some regions
show negativ correlations between final states with fermions and bosons meaning if the signal strengths
for fermions decrease the signal strengths for bosonic final states increase, while other regions
show positive correlations. The sign of the correlations is a strong function of the mass difference
between the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson and the Higgs singlet, so looking for correlations could
give useful hints about the existence and mass of the singlet Higgs boson. The features of these "genuine"
NMSSM effects have been investigated in representative benchmark points for each of the three regions
where a single effect is dominant. These benchmark points have been detailed in the Appendix.
