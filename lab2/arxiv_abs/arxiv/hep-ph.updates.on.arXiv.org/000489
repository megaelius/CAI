With the Planck 2015 result, most of the well known canonical large field inflation models turned
out to be strongly disfavored. Axion inflation is one of such models which is becoming marginalized
with the increasing precession of CMB data. In this paper, we have shown that with a simple Galileon
type modification to the marginally favored axion model calling G-axion, we can turn them into one
of the most favored models with its detectable prediction of $r$ and $n_s$ within its PLANCK $1\sigma
$ range for a wide range of parameters. Interestingly it is this modification which plays the important
role in turning the inflationary predictions to be independent of the explicit value of axion decay
constant $f$. However, dynamics after the inflation turned out to have a non-trivial dependence
on $f$. For each G-axion model there exists a critical value of $f_c$ such that for $f>f_c$ we have
the oscillating phase after inflation and for $f<f_c$ we have non-oscillatory phase. Therefore,
we obtained a range of sub-Planckian value of model parameters which give rise to consistent inflation.
However for sub-Planckian axion decay constant the inflaton field configuration appeared to be
singular after the end of inflation. To reheat the universe we, therefore, employ the instant preheating
mechanism at the instant of first zero crossing of the inflaton. To our surprise, the instant preheating
mechanism turned out to be inefficient as opposed to usual non-oscillatory quintessence model.
For another class of G-axion model with super-Planckian axion decay constant, we performed in detail
the reheating constraints analysis considering the latest PLANCK result.
