In this work, we investigate additional signatures to support the tetraquark mixing framework
that has been recently proposed as a possible structure for the two nonets, namely $a_0 (980)$, $K_0^*
(800)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$ in the light nonet, $a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$,
$f_0 (1500)$ in the heavy nonet. %More supporting arguments will be presented in favor of the tetraquark
picture for the two nonets %rather than a two-quark picture or a meson-meson bound state. First,
we advocate that the two nonets form the flavor nonet approximately satisfying the Gell-Mann--Okubo
mass relation. Then we reexamine the mass ordering generated from the tetraquark nonets and show
that this mass ordering is satisfied by the two nonets although the ordering in the heavy nonet is
marginal. The marginal mass ordering however can be regarded as another signature for tetraquarks
because it can be explained partially by the hyperfine masses calculated from the tetraquark mixing
framework. The tetraquark mixing parameters are found to be independent of isospins giving additional
support for the formation of the flavor nonets. In addition, we discuss the other approaches like
two-quark pictures or meson-meson bound states, and their possible limitations in explaining
the two nonets. As a peculiar signature distinguished from other approaches, we investigate the
fall-apart coupling strengths into two vector mesons from our tetraquarks. Coupling strengths
into the two-vector modes are found to enhance strongly in the heavy nonet while they are suppressed
in the light nonet. The coupling ratios, which depend on the isospin channel, are found to be huge
around $\sim 15$. This trend in the two-vector modes, which is opposite to that in the two-pseudoscalar
fall-apart modes, can provide another testing ground for the tetraquark mixing framework.
