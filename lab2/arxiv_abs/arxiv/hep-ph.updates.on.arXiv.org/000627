Discrete residual symmetries and flavour dependent CP symmetries consistent with them have been
used to constrain neutrino mixing angles and CP violating phases. We discuss here role of such CP
symmetries in obtaining a pseudo-Dirac neutrino which can provide a pair of neutrinos responsible
for the solar splitting. It is shown that if (a) $3\times 3$ Majorana neutrino matrix $M_\nu$ is invariant
under a discrete $Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetry generated by $S_{1,2}$, (b) CP symmetry $X$ transform
$M_\nu$ as $X^T M_\nu X=M_\nu^*$, and (c) $X$ and $S_{1,2}$ obey consistency conditions $X S_{1,2}^*
X^\dagger=S_{2,1}$, then two of the neutrino masses are degenerate independent of specific forms
of $X$, $S_1$ and $S_2$. Explicit examples of this result are discussed in the context of $\Delta(6
n^2)$ groups which can also be used to constrain neutrino mixing matrix $U$. Degeneracy in two of
the masses does not allow complete determination of $U$ but it can also be fixed once the perturbations
are introduced. We consider explicit perturbations which break $Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetries but
respect CP. These are shown to remove the degeneracy and provide a predictive description of neutrino
spectrum. In particular, a correlation $\sin 2\theta_{23}\sin\delta_{CP}=\pm {\rm Im}[p]$
is obtained between the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ and the CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}$
in terms of a group theoretically determined phase factor $p$. Experimentally interesting case
$\theta_{23}=\frac{\pi}{4}$, $\delta_{CP}=\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ emerges for groups which predict
purely imaginary $p$. We present detailed predictions of the allowed ranges of neutrino mixing
angles, phases and the lightest neutrino mass for three of the lowest $\Delta(6 n^2)$ groups with
$n=2,4,6$.
