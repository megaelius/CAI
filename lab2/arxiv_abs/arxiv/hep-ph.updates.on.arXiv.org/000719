We study the sensitivity to the shape of the Higgs potential of single, double, and triple Higgs production
at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. Physics beyond the Standard Model is parameterised through the inclusion
of higher-dimensional operators $(\Phi^\dagger \Phi- v^2/2)^n/\Lambda^{(2n-4)}$ with $n=3,4$,
which allows a consistent treatment of independent deviations of the cubic and quartic self couplings
beyond the tree level. We calculate the effects induced by a modified potential up to one loop in single
and double Higgs production and at the tree level in triple Higgs production, for both $Z$ boson associated
and $W$ boson fusion production mechanisms. We consider two different scenarios. First, the dimension
six operator provides the dominant contribution (as expected, for instance, in a linear effective-field-theory(EFT));
we find in this case that the corresponding Wilson coefficient can be determined at $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$
accuracy by just combining accurate measurements of single Higgs cross sections at $\sqrt{\hat
s}=$240-250 GeV and double Higgs production in $W$ boson fusion at higher energies. Second, both
operators of dimension six and eight can give effects of similar order, i.e., independent quartic
self coupling deviations are present. Constraints on Wilson coefficients can be best tested by
combining measurements from single, double and triple Higgs production. Given that the sensitivity
of single Higgs production to the dimension eight operator is presently unknown, we consider double
and triple Higgs production and show that combining their information colliders at higher energies
will provide first coarse constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficient.
