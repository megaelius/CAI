This paper studies new possibilities to directly measure a hypothetical $CP$-odd (pseudoscalar)
component in the top-quark Yukawa coupling. In particular, the role of the $t{\bar t} h$ center-of-mass
rest frame in the associated production of a top pair and a $h$ boson at the LHC is explored. The $h$
boson is assumed to have both a $CP$-even (scalar) and a $CP$-odd coupling to the top quark. The relative
strength of the scalar and pseudoscalar components is regulated by an angle $\alpha$. Observables
sensitive to the nature of the top-quark Yukawa coupling are proposed. These observables are defined
in terms of the transverse and longitudinal projections of $t$, $\bar{t}$ and $h$ momenta with respect
to the beam axis in the $t{\bar t} h$ rest frame. Distributions differential with respect to those
observables are evaluated up to NLO in QCD. These distributions are found to be sensitive to the $CP$
nature of the coupling. Dileptonic final states of the $t{\bar t} h$ system (with $h\rightarrow
b\bar b$) are used, after fast DELPHES detector simulation and full event reconstruction through
a kinematic fit, as a case study to test the observables' sensitivity to the $CP$ nature of the coupling.
Confidence levels are presented as a function of the total integrated LHC luminosity for the case
of exclusion of a pure $CP$-odd coupling against the Standard Model $CP$-even hypothesis. By using
observables evaluated in the $t{\bar t} h$ system, the luminosity needed to directly probe the $CP$
properties of the top-quark Yukawa coupling at the High-Luminosity run of the LHC can be decreased
by a few hundred inverse femtobarns, when compared to analyses that use observables in the laboratory
rest frame. In addition, transverse momentum distributions of the $h$ boson and top quarks are found
to provide no more discriminant power than a counting experiment.
