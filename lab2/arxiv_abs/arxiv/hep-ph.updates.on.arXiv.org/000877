The observed low-energy values of the SU(3)x SU(2)x U(1) gauge couplings, extrapolated via the
minimal Standard Model Renormalization Group evolution, hint at the exciting possibility of a
Grand Unified Theory (GUT) at M_U \sim 10^14 GeV --- a scale, however, too high to probe directly via
collider searches. Fortunately, since the Hubble scale H can be as high as 5 x 10^13 GeV \sim M_U during
the inflationary era, such GUT scale states can be cosmologically produced at that time and leave
direct on-shell signatures such as their masses and spins, via primordial non-Gaussianity (NG).
We explore this possibility in one of its simplest realizations given by the extra-dimensional
framework of orbifold GUTs, in which proton decay can be straightforwardly suppressed to be within
the stringent bounds. Here, along with the massive GUT states there must also be H-mass spin-2 Kaluza-Klein
(KK) gravitons, collectively giving rise to striking NG signatures. In our set-up we localize the
inflaton on one of the boundaries of an extra dimension. The inflationary vacuum energy can readily
lead to formation of a horizon in the bulk, where the KK modes then form a continuum above a mass gap
of ~ O(H). We find that the optimal case for observable NG signals is when the extra dimension is stabilized
close to the onset of this horizon, ensuring a discrete KK spectrum such that the lightest KK modes
can be cosmologically produced without significant Boltzmann suppressions. Although we mostly
focus on the case where there is no higher-dimensional cosmological constant, we also obtain considerable
holographic insights from the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence when such a cosmological constant is
included.
