In this paper, we will make systematic calculations for the branching ratios and the CP-violating
asymmetries of the twenty one $\bar{B}^0_s \to PV $ decays by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD)
factorization approach. Besides the full leading-order (LO) contributions, all currently known
next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions are taken into account. We found numerically that:
(a) the NLO contributions can provide $\sim 40\%$ enhancement to the LO PQCD predictions for ${\cal
B}(\bar{B}_s^0 \to K^0 \bar{K}^{*0})$ and $ {\cal B}(\bar{B}_s^0 \to K^{\pm}K^{*\mp})$, or a
$\sim 37\% $ reduction to $ \calb(\bar{B}_s^0 \to \pi^{-} K^{*+})$, and we confirmed that the inclusion
of the known NLO contributions can improve significantly the agreement between the theory and those
currently available experimental measurements, (b) the total effects on the PQCD predictions
for the relevant $B\to P$ transition form factors after the inclusion of the NLO twist-2 and twist-3
contributions is generally small in magnitude: less than $ 10\%$ enhancement respect to the leading
order result, (c) for the "tree" dominated decay $\bar B_s^0\to K^+ \rho^- $ and the "color-suppressed-tree"
decay $\bar B_s^0\to \pi^0 K^{*0}$, the big difference between the PQCD predictions for their branching
ratios are induced by different topological structure and by interference effects among the decay
amplitude ${\cal A}_{T,C}$ and ${\cal A}_P$: constructive for the first decay but destructive
for the second one, and (d) for $\bar{B}_s^0 \to V(\eta, \etar)$ decays, the complex pattern of the
PQCD predictions for their branching ratios can be understood by rather different topological
structures and the interference effects between the decay amplitude $\cala(V\eta_q)$ and $\cala(V\eta_s)$
due to the $\eta-\etar$ mixing.
