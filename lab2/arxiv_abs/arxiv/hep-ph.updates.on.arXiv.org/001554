We study the feasibility of realizing supersymmetric new inflation model, introduced by Senoguz
and Shafi in [1], for $SU(5)$ and flipped $SU(5)$ models of grand unified theories (GUTs). This realization
requires an additional $U(1)_R \times Z_{n}$ symmetry for its successful implementation. The
standard model (SM) gauge singlet scalar components of $24_H$ and $10_H$ GUT Higgs superfields
are respectively employed to realize successful inflation in $SU(5)$ and flipped $SU(5)$ models.
The predictions of the various inflationary observables lie within the recent Planck bounds on
the scalar spectral index, $n_s$, for $n \geq 5$ in $SU(5)$ model and for $n \geq 6$ in flipped $SU(5)$
model. In particular, the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ and the running of spectral index $d n_s/ d\ln
k$ are negligibly small and lie in the range, $10^{-12} \lesssim r \lesssim 10^{-8}$ and $10^{-9}
\lesssim dn_s/d\ln k \lesssim 10^{-3}$, for realistic values of $n$. In numerical estimation of
the various predictions, we fix the gauge symmetry breaking scale, $M$, around $2 \times 10^{16}$
GeV. The issue of gauge coupling unification in $R$-symmetric $SU(5)$ is evaded by adding vectorlike
families with mass splitting within their multiplets. The dilution of monopoles beyond the observable
limit is naturally achieved in the breaking of $SU(5)$ gauge symmetry during inflation. A realistic
scenario of reheating with non-thermal leptogenesis is employed for both models. The predicted
range of reheat temperature within Planck bounds, $3 \times 10^{7}\text{ GeV }\lesssim T_r \lesssim
2 \times 10^{9}$ GeV, is safe from the gravitino problem for the gravitino mass, $m_{3/2} \gtrsim
10$ TeV. Finally, the $U(1)_R \times Z_{n}$ symmetry is also observed to play a crucial role in suppressing
the various fast proton decay operators.
