We have proposed a generation mechanism of non repeating ( repeating ) fast radio bursts: They arise
by axion star collisions with neutron stars ( accretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion
star as coherent state of axions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating
with frequency $m_a/2\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons coherently
oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The radiations stop when thermal fluctuations
produced by the oscillation disturb the coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is
determined by the time scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra of
the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally broaden spectra have
a feature that the bandwidths $\delta\nu$ are proportional to their center frequencies $\nu_c$.
The presence of various center frequencies ( $1.2$GHz$\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is
attributed to Doppler shifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk.
On the other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center frequencies. They come
from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift also makes the durations of the bursts with
higher frequencies become shorter. Because the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed
to be stronger than those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating FRBs are
larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields of the neutron stars also lead
to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs, which are over the extent of the receiver frequency
range. The spectral features of the recently discovered new repeating FRB 180814.J0422+75 are
coincident with our general analyses of the repeating FRB 121102.
