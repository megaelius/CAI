We studied the effect of a strong magnetic field ($B$) on the electrical conductivity of hot quark
matter. The electrical conductivity is a key transport coefficient determining the time dependence
and strength of magnetic fields generated in a relativistic heavy-ion collision. A~magnetic field
induces Hall anisotropic conduction, phase-space Landau-level quantization and, if sufficiently
strong, interferes with prominent QCD phenomena such as dynamical quark mass generation, likely
affecting the quark matter electrical conductivity, which depends strongly on the quark masses.
To address these issues, we used a quasi-particle description of quark matter in which the electric
charge carriers are constituent quarks with temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent masses
predicted by a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The model accurately describes recent lattice QCD results
showing magnetic catalysis at low temperatures and inverse magnetic catalysis at temperatures
close to the pseudocritical temperature ($T_{\rm pc}$) of the QCD phase transition. We found that
the magnetic field increases the conductivity component parallel to it and decreases the transverse
component, in qualitative agreement with recent lattice QCD results. In addition, we found that:
(1)~for a fixed value of $B$, increasing temperature causes enhancement in all the components of
the conductivity, (2)~the anisotropy increases with~$B$, (3)~longitudinal conductivity is
increased due to the quantum effects leading to phase-space Landau-level quantization, (4)~lowest
Landau level approximation behaves poorly for temperatures close to $T_{\rm pc}$, and (5)~inverse
magnetic catalysis leaves a distinctive signal in all components of the conductivity, a kink at
$T_{\rm pc}$.
