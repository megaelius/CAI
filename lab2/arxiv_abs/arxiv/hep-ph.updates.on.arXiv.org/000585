In this work, an independent and detailed statistical analysis of the Double Chooz experiment is
performed. In order to have a thorough understanding of the implications of the Double Chooz data
on both oscillation parameters $\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$, we decided to
analyze the data corresponding to the Far detector, with no additional restriction. This differs
from previous analyses which only aim to estimate the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$. By doing this,
confidence regions and best fit values are obtained for ($\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13}),\Delta m^2_{31}$).
This analysis yields an out-of order $\Delta m^2_{31}$ minimum, which has already been mentioned
in previous works, and it is corrected with the inclusion of additional restrictions. With such
restrictions it is obtained that $\sin ^{2}(2 \theta _{13})=0{.}084_{-0{.}028}^{+0{.}030}$
and $\Delta m^2_{31}=2.444^{+0.187}_{-0.215} \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$/c$^4$. Our analysis allows
us to study the effects of the so called "spectral bump" around 5 MeV, it is observed that a variation
of this spectral bump may be able to move the $\Delta m^2_{31}$ best fit value, in such a way that $\Delta
m^2_{31}$ takes the order of magnitude of the MINOS' value. In other words, if we allow the variation
of the spectral bump, then we may be able to determine both oscillation parameters using Far Detector
Data only, with no further restrictions from other experiments. Finally, we performed two different
analyses, aiming to eliminate the effects of the energy bump. As a consequence, it is found that unlike
the Far Detector analysis, the Near Detector Data may be able to fully determine both oscillation
parameters by itself, resulting in, $\sin^2(2\theta_{13}) = 0.095 \pm 0.053$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{31}
= 2.63^{+0.98}_{-1.15} \times 10^{-3} \text{eV}^2 / \text{c}^4$.
