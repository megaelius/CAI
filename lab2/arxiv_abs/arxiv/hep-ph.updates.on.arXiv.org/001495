We argue that theories with gauge Landau poles in the ultraviolet reorganise themselves into a symmetry
restored confining high energy phase. This phase is characterised by the formation of {\emph{physical}}
gauge-singlet condensates that form an ineluctable background present in all the symmetry broken
phases allowed in the weak coupling region below the gauge Landau pole. Using consistency requirements
relating chiral condensates imposed by the so called Generalized Konishi Anomaly(GKA), we show
that dimensional transmutation via gaugino condensation {\emph{in the ultraviolet}} drives
gauge symmetry breaking in a large class of {\emph{asymptotically strong}} Supersymmetric gauge
theories. For Adjoint multiplet type chiral superfields $\Phi$ (transforming as $r \times \bar
r$ representations of a non Abelian gauge group G), solution of the GKA equations allows calculation
of quantum corrected vevs in terms of the dimensional transmutation scale $\Lambda \simeq M_X \,
e^{\frac{8\pi^2}{ g^2(M_X) b_0}} $ which determines the G-singlet physical gaugino condensate.
Thus the gauge coupling at the perturbative unification scale $M_X$ generates GUT symmetry breaking
vevs by non-perturbative dimensional transmutation. This obviates the need for large(or any)
input mass scales in the superpotential. Rank reduction can be achieved by including pairs of chiral
superfields transforming as either $({\bf Q}(r),{ \bf\bar Q}(\bar r))$ or $ (\Sigma((r\otimes
r)_{symm})), {\bar\Sigma}(({\bar r \otimes\bar r})_{symm})$, that form trilinear matrix gauge
invariants $\bar Q\cdot \Phi\cdot Q, {\bar\Sigma} \cdot \Phi\cdot \Sigma $ with $\Phi$. Novel,
robust and {\emph{ultraminimal}} Grand unification algorithms emerge from the analysis. We sketch
the structure of a realistic Spin(10) model, with the $16$-plet of Spin(10) as the base representation
$r$ which mimics the realistic MSGUT.
