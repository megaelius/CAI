Leading (large) logarithms in non-renormalizable theories have been investigated in the recent
past. Besides some general considerations, explicit results for the expansion coefficients (in
terms of leading logarithms) of partial wave amplitudes and of scalar and vector form factors have
been given. Analyticity and unitarity constraints haven been used to obtain the expansion coefficients
of partial waves in massless theories, yielding form factors and the scalar two-point function
to five-loop order in the O(4)/O(3) model. Later, the all order solutions for the partial waves in
any O(N+1)/O(N) model were found. Also, results up to four-loop order exist for massive theories.
Here we extend the implications of analyticity and unitarity constraints on the leading logarithms
to arbitrary loop order in massless theories. We explicitly obtain the scalar and vector form factors
as well as to the scalar two-point function in any O(N) and SU(N) type models. We present relations
between the expansion coefficients of these quantities and those of of the relevant partial waves.
Our work offers a consistency check on the published results in the O(N) models for form factors,
and new results for the scalar two-point function. For the SU(N) type models, we use the known expansion
coefficients for partial waves to obtain those for scalar and vector form factors as well as for the
scalar two-point function. Our results for the form factor offer a check for the known and future
results for massive O(N) and SU(N) type models when the massless limit is taken. Mathematica notebooks
which can be used to calculate the expansion coefficients are provided as ancillary files.
