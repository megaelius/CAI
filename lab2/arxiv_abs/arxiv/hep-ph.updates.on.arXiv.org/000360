It has long been known that photons and gravitons may appear as vector and tensor Goldstone modes
caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). Usually this approach is considered
for photons and gravitons separately. We develop an emergent electrogravity model where both photons
and gravitons appear as states solely consisting of zero modes. This SLIV is realized through the
length-fixing constraints put on vector and tensor fields, A_{mu}^2=(+-)M_{A}^2 and H_{mu,nu}^2=(+-)M_{H}^2
(M_{A} and M_{H} are the proposed scales for Lorentz violation) in the theory consisting of the ordinary
QED and the tensor field gravity model which mimics the linearized general relativity in Minkowski
spacetime. We show that such a SLIV pattern being related to breaking of the global symmetries of
the above nonlinear constraints rather than directly with Lorentz violation induces the massless
Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone modes shared among the physical photon and graviton. While for
the vector field case symmetry of the constraint coincides with Lorentz symmetry, for the tensor
field this symmetry appear much higher that provides a sufficient number of zero modes to complete
simultaneously both photon and graviton components. Accordingly, while photon may only contain
true Goldstone modes, some pseudo-Goldstone modes appear necessary to be collected in graviton
together with true Goldstone modes. When expressed in terms of these modes, the theory looks essentially
nonlinear and contains a variety of Lorentz and CPT violating couplings. However, all SLIV effects
turn out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered in detail.
