A unification of left-right $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\mathrm{L}} \times \mathrm{SU}(3)_{\mathrm{R}}$,
color $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\mathrm{C}}$ and family $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetries
in a maximal rank-8 subgroup of $\mathrm{E}_8$ is proposed as a landmark for future explorations
beyond the Standard Model (SM). While the product of the first three $\mathrm{SU}(3)$'s is known
as the gauge trinification originating from $\mathrm{E}_6$, an addition of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\mathrm{F}}$
family symmetry represents yet another possible but unexplored layer of high-scale unification
due to an $\mathrm{E}_6 \times \mathrm{SU}(3)_{\mathrm{F}} \subset \mathrm{E}_8$ embedding.
We discuss the implications of such an embedding in a supersymmetric (SUSY) model based on the trinification
gauge $\left[ \mathrm{SU}(3) \right]^3$ and global $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\mathrm{F}}$ family symmetries
with a constrained set of SUSY conserving and soft SUSY breaking operators. Among the key properties
of this model are the unification of SM Higgs and lepton sectors predicting a common Yukawa coupling
for chiral fermions, the absence of the $\mu$-problem, gauge couplings unification and baryon
number conservation at the Grand Unification scale, as well as light SM fermions. The minimal field
content that may lead to a consistent SM-like effective theory at low energies is composed of one
$\mathrm{E}_6$ $27$-plet per generation as well as three gauge and one family $\mathrm{SU}(3)$
octets belonging to the fundamental sector of $\mathrm{E}_8$. The details of the corresponding
(SUSY and gauge) symmetry breaking scheme and the resulting effective low-energy scenarios are
discussed.
