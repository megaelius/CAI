This work is dedicated to the memory of Raymond Stora (1930-2015). $SU(2)_L$ is the simplest spontaneous
symmetry breaking (SSB) non-Abelian gauge theory: a complex scalar doublet $\phi =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}H+i\pi_3
-\pi_2 + i\pi_1\end{bmatrix}\equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\tilde{H}e^{2i\tilde{t}\cdot\tilde{\vec{\pi}}/<H>}\begin{bmatrix}1
0\end{bmatrix}$ and a vector $\vec{W}^\mu$. In Landau gauge, $\vec{W}^\mu$ is transverse, $\vec{\tilde{\pi}}$
are massless derivatively coupled Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGB). A global shift symmetry enforces
$m^{2}_{\tilde{\pi}}=0$. We observe that on-shell T-matrix elements of physical states ${\vec
W}^\mu$,$\phi$ are independent of global $SU(2)_{L}$ transformations, and that the associated
global current is exactly conserved for amplitudes of physical states. We identify two towers of
"1-soft-pion" global Ward-Takahashi Identities (WTI), which govern the $\phi$-sector, and represent
a new global symmetry which we call $SU(2)_L\otimes$BRST, a symmetry not of the Lagrangian but of
the physical states. The first gives relations among off-shell Green's functions, the second governs
on-shell T-matrix elements, replacing the Adler self-consistency conditions. These WTI constrain
the all-loop-orders scalar-sector effective Lagrangian and guarantee IR finiteness of the theory.
These on-shell WTI include a Lee-Stora-Symanzik (LSS) theorem, which enforces the condition $m_{\pi}^{2}=0$
(far stronger than $m_{\tilde{\pi}}^{2}=0$) and causes all relevant-operator contributions
to the effective Lagrangian to vanish exactly. The global $SU(2)_L$ and the BRST transformations
commute in $R_\xi$ gauges. With the on-shell T-matrix constraints, the physics therefore has more
symmetry than does its BRST invariant Lagrangian. We also show that the statements made above hold
for the electroweak sector of the Standard Model bosons.
