The gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model can provide for additional contributions to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment by means of a loop involving the $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson. However, the
parameter space of such models is severely constrained if one combines the latest muon $(g-2)$ data
with various neutrino experiments, such as neutrino trident production, $\nu -e$ and $\nu -q$ elastic
scattering, etc. In a supersymmetric $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model, a larger region of parameter
space opens up, thus enabling one to explore otherwise forbidden regions of parameter space in nonsupersymmetric
models involving the new gauge coupling ($g_X$) and the mass of the $Z^\prime$ gauge boson ($M_{Z^{\prime}}$)
. We show that the minimal model with the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) field content
is strongly disfavored from $Z$-boson decay and neutrino data. We also show that the nonminimal
model with two extra singlet superfields can lead to correct neutrino masses and mixing involving
both tree-level and one-loop contributions. We find that, in this model, both muon $(g-2)$ and neutrino
data may be simultaneously explained in a parameter region consistent with experimental observations.
In addition, we observe that the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly can be accommodated even with higher values
of electroweak sparticle masses compared to the MSSM. Charged lepton-flavor-violating processes
(like $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$, $\tau\rightarrow \mu\gamma$, etc.) may have potentially large
branching ratios in this scenario. Depending on the magnitude of the supersymmetry contribution
to these processes, they may constrain hitherto unconstrained regions of the $M_{Z^{\prime}}-g_X$
parameter space. However, we find that these branching fractions never exceed their upper bounds
in a region where both muon $(g-2)$ and neutrino oscillation data can be simultaneously accommodated.
