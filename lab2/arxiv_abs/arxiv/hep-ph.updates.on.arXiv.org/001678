We calculate the gauge terms of the one-loop anomalous dimension matrix for the dimension-six operators
of the Standard Model effective field theory (SM EFT). Combining these results with our previous
results for the $\lambda$ and Yukawa coupling terms completes the calculation of the one-loop anomalous
dimension matrix for the dimension-six operators. There are 1350 $CP$-even and $1149$ $CP$-odd
parameters in the dimension-six Lagrangian for 3 generations, and our results give the entire $2499
\times 2499$ anomalous dimension matrix. We discuss how the renormalization of the dimension-six
operators, and the additional renormalization of the dimension $d \le 4$ terms of the SM Lagrangian
due to dimension-six operators, lays the groundwork for future precision studies of the SM EFT aimed
at constraining the effects of new physics through precision measurements at the electroweak scale.
As some sample applications, we discuss some aspects of the full RGE improved result for essential
processes such as $gg \to h$, $h \to \gamma \gamma$ and $h \to Z \gamma$, for Higgs couplings to fermions,
for the precision electroweak parameters $S$ and $T$, and for the operators that modify important
processes in precision electroweak phenomenology, such as the three-body Higgs boson decay $h
\rightarrow Z \, \ell^+ \, \ell^-$ and triple gauge boson couplings. We discuss how the renormalization
group improved results can be used to study the flavor problem in the SM EFT, and to test the minimal
flavor violation (MFV) hypothesis. We briefly discuss the renormalization effects on the dipole
coefficient $C_{e\gamma}$ which contributes to $\mu \to e \gamma$ and to the muon and electron magnetic
and electric dipole moments.
