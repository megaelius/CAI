Dimensionless effective coupling constants $g_{2k}$ which determine nonlinear susceptibilities
and enter the scaling equation of state possess universal values at the Curie point. They are calculated
on the base of $n$-vector field model within the frame of pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansion approach.
Pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions for $g_6$ and $g_8$ originating from 4-loop and 3-loop renormalization
group (RG) series respectively are derived for arbitrary $n$. The series for ratios $R_6 = g_6/g_4^2$
and $R_8 = g_8/g_4^3$ are also found and the pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansion for Wilson fixed point
location $g_{4}^*$ that descends from 6-loop RG expansion for $\beta$-function is reported. Numerical
results are presented for $0 \le n \le 64$, with particular attention paid to the cases $n = 0, 1, 2,
3$ that are of prime physical importance. Pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions for quartic and sextic
couplings have rapidly diminishing coefficients, so simple Pad\'e resummation is sufficient
to yield precise numerical estimates. Moreover, direct summation of these series with optimal
truncation yields the critical values of $g_4$ and $R_6$ that are almost as accurate as those given
by Pad\'e technique. Numerical estimates for $g_8^*$ and $R_8^*$ given by pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansions
are found to be much worse than that for the lower-order couplings independently on the resummation
method used. Numerical effectiveness of the pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansion approach in two dimensions
is also studied. Pseudo-$\epsilon$ expansion for $g_4^*$ originating from 5-loop RG series for
$\beta$-function of 2D $n$-vector field model is used to get numerical estimates for $n$ ranging
from 0 to 64. The approach discussed is shown to give precise enough values of $g_{4}^*$ down to $n
= 2$ and leads to fair estimates in physical cases $n = 1, 0$.
