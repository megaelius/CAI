We have conducted extensive lattice simulations to study the post-inflation dynamics of multifield
models involving nonminimal couplings. We explore the parameter dependence of preheating in these
models and describe the various time-scales that control such nonlinear processes as energy transfer,
re-scattering, and the approach to radiation-domination and thermalization. In the limit of large
nonminimal couplings ($\xi_I \sim 100$), we find that efficient transfer of energy from the inflaton
condensate to radiative degrees of freedom, emergence of a radiation-dominated equation of state,
and the onset of thermalization each consistently occur within $N_{\rm reh} \lesssim 3$ $e$-folds
after the end of inflation, largely independent of the values of the other couplings in the models.
The exception is the case of negative ellipticity, in which there is a misalignment between the dominant
direction in field-space along which the system evolves and the larger of the nonminimal couplings
$\xi_I$. In those cases, the field-space-driven parametric resonance is effectively shut off.
More generally, the competition between the scalar fields' potential and the field-space manifold
structure can yield interesting phenomena such as two-stage resonances. Despite the explosive
particle production, which can lead to a quick depletion of the background energy density, the nonlinear
processes do not induce any super-horizon correlations after the end of inflation in these models,
which keeps predictions for CMB observables unaffected by the late-time amplification of isocurvature
fluctuations. Hence the excellent agreement between primordial observables and recent observations
is preserved for this class of models, even when we consider post-inflation dynamics.
