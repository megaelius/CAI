Deep inelastic scattering is investigated here as a tool to probe the polarized nucleon structure
function in nonsinglet case. During the solution of evolution equations in moment space we will
encounter with non-integer power of coupling constant. Therefore it is possible to use the approach
of fractional analytical perturbation theory (FAPT). Using this approach, the singularity of
renormalized coupling constant is removed at $Q=\Lambda$ scale as Landau pole and an opportunity
would be performed to employ the perturbative calculations at small values of energy scales even
less than $\Lambda$ sclae. To modify the analytical perturbation theory, a newer approach is introduced,
called 2$\delta$anQCD in which the analytical coupling constant at low energy region is controlling
by two delta functions. This model give us more reliable results for the concerned QCD observable
and ends up with safe infrared result. We intend to calculate the nonsinglet part of polarized nucleon
structure function, using 2$\delta$anQCD model and compare it with the result from conventional
perturbative QCD (pQCD). For this purposes we employ anQCD package in Mathematica environment
to establish the analytic coupling constant. The results at some energy scales are also compared
with the available experimental data which involves good consistency with them. Investigating
the results indicates that the nucleon structure function at small energy scales contain smoother
behaviour, using 2$\delta$anQCD model than the conventional pQCD. It is due to the more converging
consequence of pertutbative series in the analytic perturbation theory. We also consider the $Q^2$
dependence of Bjorken sum rule (BSR), using 2$\delta$anQCD model. There is good agreement between
the available experimental data for BSR and the result from utilized model, specially at low energy
scales.
