Anisotropic momentum diffusion and the drag coefficients of heavy quarks have been computed in
a strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma beyond the static limit within the framework of Langevin
dynamics. Depending on the orientation of the motion of the heavy quark with respect to the direction
of the magnetic field, five components of the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficients have
been estimated in the magnetized thermal medium. The current focus is on the regime $M\gg\sqrt{eB}\gg
T$, $M$ being the mass of heavy quark. The light quarks/antiquarks follow $1+1-$dimensional Landau
level kinematics, and heavy quark dynamics are not directly affected by the magnetic field in the
medium. It is observed that for the case of heavy quark motion parallel to the magnetic field, the
component of diffusion coefficient transverse both to the field and the heavy quark velocity $(\kappa^{\parallel}_{TT})$
turns out to be dominant compared to the component longitudinal to both the field and motion $(\kappa^{\parallel}_{LL})$,
$i.e.$, $\kappa^{\parallel}_{TT}\gg \kappa^{\parallel}_{LL}$. On the other hand, for heavy
quark moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, the component of diffusion coefficient along
the direction of the magnetic field and transverse to the heavy quark velocity is dominant in comparison
to the components parallel and perpendicular to the heavy quark velocity in the plane transverse
to the magnetic field, $i.e.$, $\kappa^{\perp}_{TL}\gg\kappa^{\perp}_{LT}\gg\kappa^{\perp}_{TT}$.
Sensitivity of the various diffusion coefficients on the strength of the magnetic field and velocity
of the heavy quark is also explored.
