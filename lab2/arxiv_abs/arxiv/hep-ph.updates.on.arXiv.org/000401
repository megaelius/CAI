The approach in which the electron and positron are treated as ordinary, different particles, each
being characterized by the complete set of the Dirac plane waves, is examined. This completely symmetric
representation that is beyond the standard QED, makes it necessary to choose another solution of
the Dirac equation for the free particle propagator as compared to that used currently. The Bethe-Salpeter
equation with these particle propagators is studied in the ladder approximation. A new branch of
the massless composite bosons formed by the coupled electron-positron pairs with the coupling
equal to the fine structure constant, has been found. It has been obtained that: 1) the massless bosons
have the normalized complex wave functions, which are transversely compressed plane waves; 2)
the transverse radius of the wave functions diverges as the boson energy goes to zero that is, the
composite bosons cannot be at rest; 3) the extension of the transverse wave function in the momentum
space and the compression of the coordinate wave function are continuously occurred with increasing
the boson energy. The reaction $e^{-}e^{+}\to B\gamma\gamma$ products of which are the massless
composite boson and two photons, is investigated. The cross-section of this reaction is derived
for the non-relativistic colliding beams of the spin-polarized electrons and positrons. In this
case the $2\gamma$ angular correlation spectrum is characterized by a narrow peak with the full-width-at-half-maximum
not exceeding 0.2 mrad. It is shown that to establish whether there is the conventional annihilation
of singlet electron-positron pair with the two-photon emission or the investigated reaction,
products of which are the three particles, experiments with the extremely non-relativistic colliding
beams should be conducted.
