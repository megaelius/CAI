Recently, the KOTO experiment at J-PARC has observed three anomalous events in the flavor-changing
rare decay $K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar\nu$, which indicates that the corresponding branching ratio
is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the Standard Model (SM) prediction. Taking this intriguing
result at face value, we explore model implications of its viable explanation by a long-lived light
SM-singlet scalar ($S$) emission, i.e. $K_L \to \pi^0 S$, with $S$ decaying outside the KOTO detector.
We derive constraints on the parameter space of such a light scalar in the context of three simple
models: (i) a real singlet scalar extension of the SM; (ii) a $B-L$ extension where neutrino masses
arise via type-I seesaw mechanism from $B-L$ breaking; and (iii) a TeV-scale left-right symmetric
model. The flavor-changing couplings needed to explain the KOTO excess in models (i) and (ii) originate
from tree-level mixing of the scalar with SM Higgs field ($h$), and in model (iii), from the mixing
of $S$ and $h$ with the neutral component of the heavy bidoublet Higgs field. After taking into account
the stringent constraints from high-precision searches for flavor-changing charged and neutral
kaon decays at NA62, E949, KOTO and CHARM experiments, as well as the astrophysical and cosmological
constraints on a light scalar, such as those from supernova energy loss, big bang nucleosynthesis
and relativistic degrees of freedom, we find that the light scalar interpretation of the KOTO excess
is excluded in models (i) and (ii) by the supernova limit. However, there is still a narrow parameter
space available in the TeV-scale left-right symmetric model to explain the KOTO excess, which can
be tested in future NA62 and DUNE experiments.
