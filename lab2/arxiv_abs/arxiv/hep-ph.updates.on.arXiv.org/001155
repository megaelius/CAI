We consider the $1s$ Lamb shift in hydrogen and helium ions, a quantity, required for an accurate
determination of the Rydberg constant and the proton charge radius by means of hydrogen spectroscopy,
as well as for precision tests of the bound-state QED. The dominant QED contribution to the uncertainty
originates from $\alpha^8m$ external-field contributions (i.e., the contributions at the non-recoil
limit). We discuss the two- and three-loop cases and in particular, we revisit calculations of the
coefficients $B_{61}, B_{60}, C_{50}$ in standard notation. We have found a missing logarithmic
contribution of order $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^6m$. We have also obtained leading pure self-energy
logarithmic contributions of order $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^8m$ and $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^9m$ and
estimated the subleading terms of order $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^7m$, $\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^8m$, and
$\alpha^2(Z\alpha)^9m$. The determination of those higher-order contributions enabled us to
improve the overall accuracy of the evaluation of the two-loop self-energy of the electron. We investigated
the asymptotic behavior of the integrand related to the next-to-leading three-loop term (order
$\alpha^3(Z\alpha)^5m$, coefficient $C_{50}$ in standard notation) and applied it to approximate
integration over the loop momentum. Our result for contributions to the $1s$ Lamb shift for the total
three loop next-to-leading term is $(-3.3\pm10.5)(\alpha^3/\pi^3)(Z\alpha)^5m$. Altogether,
we have completed the evaluation of the logarithmic contributions to the $1s$ Lamb shift of order
$\alpha^8m$ and reduced the overall $\alpha^8m$ uncertainty by approximately a factor of three
for H, D, and He$^+$ as compared with the most recent CODATA compilation.
