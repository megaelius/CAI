We performed systematic studies for the effects of event-by-event efficiency fluctuations on
efficiency correction for cumulant analysis in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments.
Experimentally, particle efficiencies of events measured with different experimental conditions
should be different. For fluctuation measurements, the final event-by-event multiplicity distributions
should be the superposed distributions of various type of events measured under different conditions.We
demonstrate the efficiency fluctuation effects in a numerical simulation, in which we construct
an event ensemble consists of events with two different efficiencies. By using the mean particle
efficiencies, we find the efficiency corrected cumulants show large deviations from the original
inputs when the discrepancy of the two efficiencies are large. We further studied the effects of
efficiency fluctuations for the cumulants of net-proton distributions by implementing the UrQMD
events of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV in a realistic STAR detector acceptance.
We consider the unequal efficiency in two sides of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), multiplicity
dependent efficiency and the event-by-event variations of the collision vertex position along
the longitudinal direction ($V_\mathrm{z}$). When the efficiencies fluctuate dramatically
within the studied event sample, the effects of efficiency fluctuations have significant impacts
on the efficiency corrections of cumulants with the mean efficiencies. We find that this effect
can be effectively suppressed by binning the entire event ensemble into various sub-event samples,
in which the efficiency variations are relative small. The final efficiency corrected cumulants
can be calculated from the weighted average of the corrected factorial moments of the sub-event
samples with the mean efficiencies.
