We study the properties of the cross section for two-gluon production in heavy-light ion collisions
derived in our previous paper on the subject in the saturation/Color Glass Condensate framework.
Concentrating on the energy and geometry dependence of the corresponding correlation functions
we find that the two-gluon correlator is a much slower function of the center-of-mass energy than
the one- and two-gluon production cross sections. The geometry dependence of the correlation function
leads to stronger azimuthal near- and away-side correlations in the tip-on-tip U+U collisions
than in the side-on-side U+U collisions, an exactly opposite behavior from the correlations generated
by the elliptic flow of the quark-gluon plasma: a study of azimuthal correlations in the U+U collisions
may thus help to disentangle the two sources of correlations. We demonstrate that the cross section
for two-gluon production in heavy-light ion collisions contains a power-law infrared (IR) divergence
even for fixed produced gluon momenta: while saturation effects in the target regulate some of the
power-law IR-divergent terms in the lowest-order expression for the two-gluon correlator, other
power-law IR-divergent terms remain, possibly due to absence of saturation effects in the dilute
projectile. Finally we rewrite our result for the two-gluon production cross-section in a $k_T$-factorized
form, obtaining a new factorized expression involving a convolution of one- and two-gluon Wigner
distributions over both the transverse momenta and impact parameters. We show that the two-gluon
production cross-section depends on two different types of unintegrated two-gluon Wigner distribution
functions.
