We provide a systematic renormalization group formalism for the mass effects in the relation of
the pole mass $m_Q^{\rm pole}$ and short-distance masses such as the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass $\overline{m}_Q$
of a heavy quark $Q$, coming from virtual loop insertions of massive quarks lighter than $Q$. The
formalism reflects the constraints from heavy quark symmetry and entails a combined matching and
evolution procedure that allows to disentangle and successively integrate out the corrections
coming from the lighter massive quarks and the momentum regions between them and to precisely control
the large order asymptotic behavior. With the formalism we systematically sum logarithms of ratios
of the lighter quark masses and $m_Q$, relate the QCD corrections for different external heavy quarks
to each other, predict the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^4)$ virtual quark mass corrections in the pole-$\overline{\rm
MS}$ mass relation, calculate the pole mass differences for the top, bottom and charm quarks with
a precision of around $20$ MeV and analyze the decoupling of the lighter massive quark flavors at
large orders. The summation of logarithms is most relevant for the top quark pole mass $m_t^{\rm
pole}$, where the hierarchy to the bottom and charm quarks is large. We determine the ambiguity of
the pole mass for top, bottom and charm quarks in different scenarios with massive or massless bottom
and charm quarks in a way consistent with heavy quark symmetry, and we find that it is $250$ MeV. The
ambiguity is larger than current projections for the precision of top quark mass measurements in
the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.
