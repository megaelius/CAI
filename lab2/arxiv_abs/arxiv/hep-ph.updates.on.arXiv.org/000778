Various quantum gravity approaches that extend beyond the standard model predict Lorentz Invariance
and Charge-Parity-Time Violation at energies approaching the Planck scale. These models frequently
predict a wavelength dependent speed of light, which would result in time delays between promptly
emitted photons at different energies, as well as a wavelength-dependent rotation of the plane
of linear polarization for photons resulting from vacuum birefringence. Here, we describe a pilot
program with an automated system of small telescopes that can simultaneously conduct high cadence
optical photometry and polarimetry of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in multiple passbands. We use
these observations as a proof-of-principle to demonstrate how such data can be used to test various
Lorentz Violation models, including special cases of the Standard Model Extension (SME). In our
initial campaign with this system, the Array Photo Polarimeter, we observed two AGN sources, including
BL Lacertae at redshift z = 0.069, and S5 B0716+714 at z = 0.31. We demonstrate that optical polarimetry
with a broadband Luminance filter combined with simultaneous $I_c$-band observations yields
SME parameter constraints that are up to ~10 and ~30 times more sensitive than with a standard $I_c$-band
filter, for SME models with mass dimension d = 5 and d = 6, respectively. Using only a small system of
telescopes with an effective 0.45-m aperture, we further demonstrate d = 5 constraints for individual
lines of sight that are within a factor of ~1-10 in sensitivity to comparable constraints from optical
polarimetry with a 3.6-m telescope. Such an approach could significantly improve existing SME
constraints via a polarimetric all-sky survey of AGN with multiple 1-meter class telescopes.
