Determinations of the proton's collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) are emerging with
growing precision due to increased experimental activity at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider.
While this copious information is valuable, the speed at which it is released makes it difficult
to quickly assess its impact on the PDFs, short of performing computationally expensive global
fits. As an alternative, we explore new methods for quantifying the potential impact of experimental
data on the extraction of proton PDFs. Our approach relies crucially on the Hessian correlation
between theory-data residuals and the PDFs themselves, as well as on a newly defined quantity ---
the sensitivity --- which represents an extension of the correlation and reflects both PDF-driven
and experimental uncertainties. This approach is realized in a new, publicly available analysis
package PDFSense, which operates with these statistical measures to identify particularly sensitive
experiments, weigh their relative or potential impact on PDFs, and visualize their detailed distributions
in a space of the parton momentum fraction $x$ and factorization scale $\mu$. This tool offers a new
means of understanding the influence of individual measurements in existing fits, as well as a predictive
device for directing future fits toward the highest impact data and assumptions. Along the way,
many new physics insights can be gained or reinforced. As one of many examples, PDFSense is employed
to rank the projected impact of new LHC measurements in jet, vector boson, and $t\bar{t}$ production
and leads us to the conclusion that inclusive jet production will play an indispensable role in future
PDF fits --- comparable to HERA deep-inelastic scattering --- by providing key leverage on the PDF
uncertainty of the Higgs production cross section, gluon, strangeness and other sea-quark flavors.
