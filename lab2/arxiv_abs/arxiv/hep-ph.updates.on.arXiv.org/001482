The production of the $f_{0}(980)$ meson at high energies is not well understood. We investigate
two different potential mechanisms for inclusive scalar meson production in the $k_t$-factorization
approach: color-singlet gluon-gluon fusion and color evaporation model. The $\gamma^* \gamma^*
\to f_0(980)$ form factor(s) can be constraint from the $f_0(980)$ radiative decay width. The $g^*
g^* \to f_0(980)$ form factors are obtained by a replacement of $\alpha_{\rm{em}}$ electromagnetic
coupling constant by $\alpha_{\rm{s}}$ strong coupling constant and appropriate color factors.
The form factors for the two couplings are parametrized with a function motivated by recent results
for scalar quarkonia. The differential cross sections are calculated in the $k_t$-factorization
approach with modern unintegrated gluon distributions. Unlike for quarkonia it seems rather difficult
to describe a preliminary ALICE data for inclusive production of $f_0(980)$ exclusively by the
color singlet gluon-gluon fusion mechanism. Two different scenarios for flavour structure of
$f_0(980)$ are considered in this context. We consider also mechanism of fusion of quark-antiquark
associated with soft gluon emission in a phenomenological color evaporation model (CEM) used sometimes
for quarkonium production. Here we use $k_t$-factorization version of CEM to include higher-order
contributions. In addition, for comparison we consider also NLO collinear approach with $q \bar{q}
q$ and $q \bar{q} g$ color octet partonic final states. Both approaches lead to a similar result.
However, very large probabilities are required to describe the preliminary ALICE data. The pomeron-pomeron
fusion mechanism is also discussed and results are quantified.
