The improved QCD light-cone sum rule (LCSR) approach provides an effective way to estimate the properties
of the heavy-to-light transition form factors (TFFs). At present, we adopt it to deal with the $B\to
D$ TFF $f^{+}(q^2)$ up to twist-4 accuracy. Our newly obtained LCSR on $f^{+}(q^2)$ provides a strong
constraint on the $D$ meson leading-twist DA, which is due to the elimination of most uncertain twist-3
contributions and the highly suppressed twist-4 contributions. Furthermore, we suggest a $D$
meson DA model based on the Brodsky-Huang-Lepage prescription, whose second Gegenbauer moment
is dominantly determined by a parameter $B$. Varying $B$ within certain region, one can conveniently
mimic the $D$ meson DA behavior suggested in the literature. Inversely, by comparing the estimations
with the experimental data on $D$ meson involved processes, one can get the possible range for the
parameter $B$ and then a determined behavior of $D$ meson DA. By applying the LCSR on $f^{+}(q^2)$
in whole allowable region, we study the matrix element $\Vcb$ together with its uncertainties by
adopting two types of processes, i.e. the $B^0/\bar{B}^0$-type and the $B^{\pm}$-type. It is noted
that a smaller $B \precsim 0.20$ shows a better agreement with the experimental value on $\Vcb$.
For example, for the case of $B=0.00$, we obtain $|V_{cb}|(B^0/\bar{B}^0-{\rm type})=(41.28
{^{+5.68}_{-4.82}} {^{+1.13}_{-1.16}}) \times 10^{-3}$ and $|V_{cb}|(B^{\pm}-{\rm type})=(40.44
{^{+5.56}_{-4.72}}~ {^{+0.98}_{-1.00}}) \times 10^{-3}$, whose first (second) uncertainty
comes from the squared average of the mentioned theoretical (experimental) uncertainties.
