We conduct a numerical study over the constrained versions of MSSM, Next-to-MSSM (NMSSM) and $U(1)$
extended MSSM (UMSSM) to probe the allowed mass ranges of the charged Higgs boson and its dominant
decay patterns, which might come into prominence in near future collider experiments. We present
the results for MSSM as a basis and compare its predictions with the extended models. Despite the
narrow mass range in MSSM as 2-3 TeV, much wider mass range is allowed as 0.5(1)-17 TeV for the Charged
Higgs boson in UMSSM (NMSSM). Such wide mass ranges for the charged Higgs boson can allow certain
decay modes, which might not be possible to realize in MSSM. We find that the dominant decay channel
is mostly tb (~ 80%). While this mode remains dominant over the whole allowed parameter space of MSSM,
we realise some special domains in NMSSM and UMSSM, in which this decay mode is less than 10%. In this
context, the decay patterns of the charged Higgs can play a significant role to distinguish among
the SUSY models. In addition to the tb decay mode, we find that the narrow mass scale in MSSM allows
only the decay modes for the charged Higgs boson to tau nu (~ 21%), and their supersymmetric partners
(~ 25%). On the other hand, it is possible to realise the mode in NMSSM and MSSM in which the charged
Higgs boson decays into a chargino and neutralino pair up to about 25%. This decay mode can be used
to distinguish these models, since MSSM does not allow such modes anymore. It can also be probed in
near future collider experiments through the missing energy and CP-violation measurements. Moreover,
the chargino mass is realized as ~ 1 TeV in NMSSM and UMSSM, and these solutions will be likely tested
soon in collider experiments through the chargino-neutralino production.
