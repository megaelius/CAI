The project of \emph{"quantum spacetime phenomenology"} focuses on searching pragmatically
for the Planck scale quantum features of spacetime. Among these features is the existence of a characteristic
length scale addressed commonly by effective approaches to quantum gravity (QG). This characteristic
length scale could be realized, for instance and simply, by generalizing the standard Heisenberg
uncertainty principle (HUP) to a \emph{"generalized uncertainty principle"} (GUP). While usually
it is expected that phenomena belonging to the realm of QG are essentially probable solely at the
so-called Planck energy, here we show how a GUP proposal containing the most general modification
of coordinate representation of the momentum operator could be probed by a \emph{"cold atomic ensemble
recoil experiment"} (CARE) as a low energy quantum system. This proposed atomic interferometer
setup has advantages over the conventional architectures owing to the enclosure in a high finesse
optical cavity which is supported by a new class of low power consumption integrated devices known
as \emph{"micro-electro-opto-mechanical systems"} (MEOMS). The proposed system comprises
of a micro mechanical oscillator instead of spherical confocal mirrors as one of the components
of high finesse optical cavity. In the framework of a bottom-up QG phenomenological viewpoint and
by taking into account the measurement accuracy realized for the fine structure constant (FSC)
from the Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) CARE, we set some constraints as upper bounds on the characteristic
parameters of the underlying GUP. In the case of superposition of the possible GUP modification
terms, we managed to set a tight constraint as $0.999978<\lambda_0<1.00002$ for the dimensionless
characteristic parameter.
