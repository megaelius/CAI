The electromagnetic form factors of a composite vector particle within the light-front formulation
of the Mandelstam formula is investigated. In order to extract the form factors from the matrix elements
of the plus component of the current in the Drell-Yan frame, where the momentum transfer is chosen
such that $q^+=q^0+q^3=0$, one has in principle the freedom to choose between different linear
combinations of matrix elements of the current operator. The different prescriptions to calculate
the electromagnetic form factors, $G_0,G_1$ and $G_2$, i.e., charge form factor, magnetic and
quadrupole respectively. If the covariance is respected, all prescriptions give the same results,
misfortune, is not the situation, the light-front approach produce different results, which depend
of the prescriptions as utilized to extract the electromagnetic form factors in the case of the spin-1
particles. The main differences of the prescriptions appear because of the light-front matrix
elements of the electromagnetic current are contaminated by the zero-modes contributions to the
same with the plus component of the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current. However, the
Inna Grach prescription is immune to the zero-modes contributions to the electromagnetic current,
then the electromagnetic form factors extracted with that prescriptions do not have zero-modes
contribution and give the same result compared with the instant form quantum field theory. Another's
prescriptions with the light-front approach are contaminated by the zero-modes contributions
to the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current with the plus component of the current.
