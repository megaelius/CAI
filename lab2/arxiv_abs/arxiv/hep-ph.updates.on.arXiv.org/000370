Higgsinos and Wino have strong motivations for being Dark Matter (DM) candidates in supersymmetry,
but their annihilation cross sections are quite large. For thermal generation and a single component
DM setup the higgsinos or wino may have masses of around 1 or 2-3 TeV respectively. For such DM candidates,
a small amount of slepton coannihilation may decrease the effective DM annihilation cross section.
This, in turn reduces the lower limit of the relic density satisfied DM mass by more than 50%. Almost
a similar degree of reduction of the same limit is also seen for squark coannihilations. However,
on the contrary, for near degeneracy of squarks and higgsino DM, near its generic upper limit, the
associated coannihilations may decrease the relic density, thus extending the upper limit towards
higher DM masses. We also compute the direct and indirect detection signals. Here, because of the
quasi-mass degeneracy of the squarks and the LSP, we come across a situation where squark exchange
diagrams may contribute significantly or more strongly than the Higgs exchange contributions
in the spin-independent direct detection cross section of DM. For the higgsino-DM scenario, we
observe that a DM mass of 600 GeV to be consistent with WMAP/PLANCK and LUX data for sfermion coannihilations.
The LUX data itself excludes the region of 450 to 600 GeV, by a half order of magnitude of the cross-section,
well below the associated uncertainty. The similar combined lower limit for a wino DM is about 1.1
TeV. There is hardly any collider bound from the LHC for squarks and sleptons in such a compressed
scenario where sfermion masses are close to the mass of a higgsino/wino LSP.
