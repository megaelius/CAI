We discuss the properties and LHC phenomenology of a potentially discoverable heavy scalar boson
($s$) that arises in the context of the renormalizable coloron model; the model also contains a light
scalar, $h$, identifiable with the 125 GeV state discovered by the LHC. These two scalar mass eigenstates
are admixtures of a weak doublet gauge eigenstate and a weak singlet gauge eigenstate. A previous
study set exclusion limits on the heavy $s$ scalar, using the stability of the scalar potential,
unitarity, electroweak precision tests, LHC searches for the 125 GeV Higgs; it also briefly discussed
the $\sqrt{s} = 7,8$ TeV LHC searches for a heavy Higgs. In this work, we show how the projected LHC
sensitivity at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV to the presence of a heavy Higgs and to the detailed properties
of the 125 GeV Higgs will further constrain the properties of the new heavy $s$ scalar. Since the renormalizable
coloron model may contain spectator fermions to remove anomalies, we examine several representative
scenarios with different numbers of spectator fermions. Our results are summarized in plots that
overlay the current exclusion limits on the $s$ boson with the projected sensitivity of the $\sqrt{s}
= 14$ TeV LHC to the new state. We find that the upcoming LHC searches should be sensitive to an $s$ scalar
of mass less than 1 TeV for essentially all of the model parameter space in which the $h$ state differs
from the Higgs boson of the SM. More precisely, unless the mixing between the weak doublet and weak
singlet gauge-eigenstate scalars is zero, the 14 TeV LHC will be sensitive to the presence of the
non-standard heavy $s$ state that is characteristic of the renormalizable coloron model.
