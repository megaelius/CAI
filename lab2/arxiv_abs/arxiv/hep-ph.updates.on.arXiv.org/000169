Jet vetoes play an important role at the LHC in the search for the Higgs and ultimately in precise measurements
of its properties. Many Higgs analyses divide the cross section into exclusive jet bins to maximize
the sensitivity in different production and decay channels. For a given jet category, the veto on
additional jets introduces sensitivity to soft and collinear emissions, which causes logarithms
in the perturbative expansion that need to be resummed to obtain precise predictions. We study the
higher-order resummation properties of several conceptually distinct kinematic variables that
can be used to veto jets in hadronic collisions. We consider two inclusive variables, the scalar
sum over pT and beam thrust, and two corresponding exclusive variables based on jet algorithms,
namely the largest pT and largest beam thrust of a jet. The inclusive variables can, in principle,
be resummed to higher orders. We show that for the jet-based variables, there are dual effects due
to clustering in the jet algorithm for both large and small jet radius R that make a complete resummation
at or beyond next-to-leading logarithmic order (NLL) challenging. For R~1, the clustering of soft
and collinear emissions gives O(1) contributions starting at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic
order that are not reproduced by an all-orders soft-collinear factorization formula and therefore
are not automatically resummed by it. For R<<1, clustering induces logarithms of R that contribute
at NLL in the exponent of the cross section, which cannot be resummed with currently available methods.
We explicitly compute the leading jet clustering effects at two loops and comment on their numerical
size.
