In a novel standard model extension it has been suggested that, even in the absence of right-handed
neutrinos and type-I seesaw, purely triplet leptogenesis leading to baryon asymmetry of the universe
can be realised by two heavy Higgs triplets which also provide type-II seesaw ansatz for neutrino
masses. In this work we discuss this model for hierarchical neutrino masses in concordance with
recently determined cosmologocal bound and oscillation data including $\theta_{23}$ in the second
octant and large Dirac CP phases. We also address the issues on dark matter and vacuum stability of
the scalar potential in a minimal extension of this model. We find that for both normal and inverted
orderings, the model fits the oscillation data with the sum of the three neutrino masses well below
the cosmological bound determined by Planck satellite data. The model also successfully predicts
the observed value of baryon asymmetry for lighter triplet mass $M_{\Delta_2}=10^{12}$ GeV and
its trilinear coupling $\mu_2=6\times 10^{10}\,\,(7.5\times 10^{10})$ GeV for normal (inverted)
ordering. With additional $Z_2$ discrete symmetry, a minimal extension of this model is shown to
be capable of predicting a scalar singlet WIMP dark matter in concordance with direct and indirect
observations. Whereas in the original model, the renormalization group running of the scalar potential
renders it negatve for the Higgs field values $|\phi|=5\times 10^9 - 10^{13}$ GeV leading to vacuum
instability, the presence of this scalar singlet dark matter in the minimally extended model is
found to ensure stability. Although the combined constraints due to relic density and direct detection
cross section allow this scalar singlet dark matter mass to be $m_{\xi}=750$ GeV, the additional
vacuum stability constraint pushes this limiting value to $m_{\xi}=1.3$ TeV which is verifiable
by ongoing experiments.
