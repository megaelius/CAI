A class of phenomenological relativistic models of hadronic systems motivated by QCD that have
dual representations as models of mesons and nucleons or quarks and gluons are investigated. These
models are designed to provided qualitative insight into the role of sea quarks in hadronic structure
and reactions. The model assumption is that the Hamiltonian can be divided into two parts; one that
involves degrees of freedom in the same connected local and global color singlet and the remaining
interactions that allow the connected local and global color singlets to interact. The first class
of interactions results in infinite towers of bare "particles" with hadronic quantum numbers.
All but a finite number of these remain stable when the second class of interactions is included.
The model interactions are expressed in terms of sub-hadronic degrees of freedom, which determine
the bare hadronic spectrum and the interactions involving the bare hadrons in terms of a small number
of sub-hadronic model parameters. As a first test, this paper considers the simplest case of mesons
that interact via a string-breaking interaction. One virtue of this model is that all of the bare
meson masses and eigenfunctions can be computed analytically. In addition, the string breaking
interaction leads to production vertices that can also be computed analytically. The relativistic
wave functions have a light-front kinematic symmetry. The goal is to find a simple model based on
sub-hadronic degrees of freedom that can provide an efficient qualitative consistent description
of hadronic masses, lifetimes, cross sections, sea quark effects, and electromagnetic properties.
The simplicity of the model makes it a potentially useful tool to study the impact of sea quarks on
hadronic structure and reactions.
