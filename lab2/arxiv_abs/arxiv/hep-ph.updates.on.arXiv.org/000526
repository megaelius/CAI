Studies of fluctuations and correlations of soft hadrons and hard and electromagnetic probes of
the dense and strongly interacting medium require event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of
high-energy heavy-ion collisions that are computing intensive. We develop a (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic
model -- CLVisc that is parallelized on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using Open Computing Language
(OpenCL) with 60 times performance increase for space-time evolution and more than 120 times for
the Cooper-Frye particlization relative to that without GPU parallelization. The pseudo-rapidity
dependence of anisotropic flow $v_n(\eta)$ are then computed in CLVisc with initial conditions
given by the A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, with energy density fluctuations both in the
transverse plane and along the longitudinal direction. Although the magnitude of $v_n(\eta)$
and the ratios between $v_2(\eta)$ and $v_3(\eta)$ are sensitive to the effective shear viscosity
over entropy density ratio $\eta_v/s$, the shape of the $v_{n}(\eta)$ distributions in $\eta$
do not depend on the value of $\eta_v/s$. The decorrelation of $v_n$ along the pseudo-rapidity direction
due to the twist and fluctuation of the event-planes in the initial parton density distributions
is also studied. The decorrelation observable $r_n(\eta^a, \eta^b)$ between $v_n\{-\eta^a\}$
and $v_n\{\eta^a\}$ with the auxiliary reference window $\eta^b$ is found not sensitive to $\eta_v/s$
when there is no initial fluid velocity. For small $\eta_v/s$, the initial fluid velocity from mini-jet
partons introduces sizable splitting of $r_n(\eta^a, \eta^b)$ between the two reference rapidity
windows $\eta^b \in [3, 4]$ and $\eta^b \in [4.4, 5.0]$, as has been observed in experiment. The implementation
of CLVisc and guidelines on how to efficiently parallelize scientific programs on GPUs are also
provided.
