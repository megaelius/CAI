In this paper, we study a range of collision systems involving deformed ions and compare the elliptic
and triangular flow harmonics produced in a hydrodynamics scenario versus a color glass condensate
(CGC) scenario. For the hydrodynamics scenario, we generate initial conditions using TRENTO and
work within a linear response approximation to obtain the final flow harmonics. For the CGC scenario,
we use the explicit calculation of two-gluon correlations taken in the high-$p_T$ ``(semi)dilute-(semi)dilute''
regime to express the flow harmonics in terms of the density profile of the collision. We consider
ultracentral collisions of deformed ions as a testbed for these comparisons because the difference
between tip-on-tip and side-on-side collisions modifies the multiplicity dependence in both
scenarios, even at zero impact parameter. We find significant qualitative differences in the multiplicity
dependence obtained in the initial conditions+hydrodynamics scenario and the CGC scenario, allowing
these collisions of deformed ions to be used as a powerful discriminator between models. We also
find that sub-nucleonic fluctuations have a systematic effect on the elliptic and triangular flow
harmonics which are most discriminating in $0-1\%$ ultracentral symmetric collisions of small
deformed ions and in $0-10\%$ $\mathrm{d} {}^{197}\mathrm{Au}$ collisions. The collision systems
we consider are ${}^{238}\mathrm{U} {}^{238}\mathrm{U}$, $\mathrm{d} {}^{197}\mathrm{Au}$,
${}^{9}\mathrm{Be} {}^{197}\mathrm{Au}$, ${}^{9}\mathrm{Be} {}^{9}\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}
{}^{3}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{3}\mathrm{He} {}^{197}\mathrm{Au}$.
