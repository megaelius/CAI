We examine new aspects of leptoquark (LQ) phenomenology using effective field theory (EFT). We
construct a complete set of leading effective operators involving SU(2) singlets scalar LQ and
the SM fields up to dimension six. We show that, while the renormalizable LQ-lepton-quark interaction
Lagrangian can address the persistent hints for physics beyond the Standard Model in the B-decays
$\bar B \to D^{(*)} \tau \bar\nu$, $\bar B \to \bar K \ell^+ \ell^-$ and in the measured anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon, the LQ higher dimensional effective operators may lead to new interesting
effects associated with lepton number violation. These include the generation of one-loop sub-eV
Majorana neutrino masses, mediation of neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay and novel LQ collider
signals. For the latter, we focus on 3rd generation LQ ($\phi_3$) in a framework with an approximate
$Z_3$ generation symmetry, and show that one class of the dimension five LQ operators may give rise
to a striking asymmetric same-charge $\phi_3 \phi_3$ pair-production signal, which leads to low
background same-sign leptons signals at the LHC. For example, with $M_{\phi_3} \sim 1$ TeV and a
new physics scale of $\Lambda \sim 5$ TeV, we expect about $5000$ positively charged $\tau^+ \tau^+$
events via $pp \to \phi_3 \phi_3 \to \tau^+ \tau^+ + 2 \cdot j_b$ ($j_b$=b-jet) at the 13 TeV LHC with
an integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$. It is interesting to note that, in the LQ EFT framework,
the expected same-sign lepton signals have a rate which is several times larger than the QCD LQ-mediated
opposite-sign leptons signals, $gg,q \bar q \to \phi_3 \phi_3^* \to \ell^+ \ell^- +X$. We also consider
the same-sign charged lepton signals in the LQ EFT framework at higher energy hadron colliders such
as a 27 TeV HE-LHC and a 100 TeV FCC-hh.
