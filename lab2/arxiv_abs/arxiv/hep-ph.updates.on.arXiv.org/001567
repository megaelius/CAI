Models of inflation where the entropic directions have large and negative masses $|m_s| \gg H$ can
be well described by a single-field EFT with an imaginary sound speed $c_s$. Among other features,
they predict an exponential enhancement of the spectrum of scalar perturbations which however
is not inherited by non-Gaussianities. In this work, I complete the calculation of the trispectrum
in this EFT by considering the contributions from the contact interaction and the exchange diagram.
While for most shapes the trispectrum is approximately constant, I find that for certain configurations
where all the momenta collapse to a line the trispectrum is proportional to $(m_s/H)^5$ for the contact
interaction and to $(m_s/H)^6$ for the exchange diagram, as anticipated by previous work. I also
discuss the UV sensitivity of the results and argue why the EFT provides a good order of magnitude
estimate. In the end, I confront the different predictions for the scalar spectrum against observations.
In models where the entropic mass is proportional to a positive power of the slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$, like in hyperinflation, the spectrum grows on small scales and becomes constrained
by the overproduction of primordial black holes. Imposing such constraint jointly with the correct
amplitude and spectral tilt at CMB scales excludes a large set of potentials. Only those where the
spectral tilt is controlled by $m_s \delta/H \sim {\cal O}(-0.01)$, where $\delta=\dot{\epsilon}/(\epsilon
H)$ is the second slow-roll parameter, are likely observationally viable. Finally, the constraints
on the bispectrum generically impose $|c_s m_s|/H \lesssim 10-20$ while those on the trispectrum
give a weaker bound when using the constraints on $g_\text{NL}^{\dot{\sigma}^4}$ as a proxy. For
hyperinflation the bispectrum bound translates into $\omega \lesssim 11$ where $\omega$ is the
turning rate in field-space.
