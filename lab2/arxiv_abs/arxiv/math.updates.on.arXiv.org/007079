The complex Langevin (CL) method is a classical numerical strategy to alleviate the numerical sign
problem in the computation of lattice field theories. Mathematically, it is a simple numerical
tool to compute a wide class of high-dimensional and oscillatory integrals. However, it is often
observed that the CL method converges but the limiting result is incorrect. The literature has several
unclear or even conflicting statements, making the method look mysterious. By an in-depth analysis
of a model problem, we reveal the mechanism of how the CL result turns biased as the parameter changes,
and it is demonstrated that such a transition is difficult to capture. Our analysis also shows that
the method works for any observables only if the probability density function generated by the CL
process is localized. To generalize such observations to lattice field theories, we formulate
the CL method on general groups using rigorous mathematical languages for the first time, and we
demonstrate that such localized probability density function does not exist in the simulation
of lattice field theories for general compact groups, which explains the unstable behavior of the
CL method. Fortunately, we also find that the gauge cooling technique creates additional velocity
that helps confine the samples, so that we can still see localized probability density functions
in certain cases, as significantly broadens the application of the CL method. The limitations of
gauge cooling are also discussed. In particular, we prove that gauge cooling has no effect for Abelian
groups, and we provide an example showing that biased results still exist when gauge cooling is insufficient
to confine the probability density function.
