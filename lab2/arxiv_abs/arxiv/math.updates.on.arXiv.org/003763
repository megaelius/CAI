Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a waveform matching procedure, which can provide a subsurface
model with a wavelength-scale resolution. However, this high resolution makes FWI prone to cycle
skipping, which drives the inversion to a local minimum when the initial model is not accurate enough.
Other sources of nonlinearities and ill-posedness are noise, uneven illumination, approximate
wave physics and parameter cross-talks. All these sources of error require robust and versatile
regularized optimization approaches to mitigate their imprint on FWI while preserving its intrinsic
resolution power. To achieve this goal, we implement bound constraints and total variation (TV)
regularization in the so-called frequency-domain wavefield-reconstruction inversion (WRI)
with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In the ADMM framework, WRI relies
on an augmented Lagrangian function, a combination of penalty and Lagrangian functions, to extend
the FWI search space by relaxing the wave-equation constraint during early iterations. Moreover,
ADMM breaks down the joint wavefield reconstruction plus parameter estimation problem into a sequence
of two linear subproblems, whose solutions are coordinated to provide the solution of the global
problem. The decomposability of ADMM is further exploited to interface in a straightforward way
bound constraints and TV regularization with WRI via variable splitting and proximal operators.
The resilience of our regularized WRI formulation to cycle skipping and noise as well as its resolution
power are illustrated with two targets of the large-contrast BP salt model. Starting from a 3Hz frequency
and a crude initial model, the extended search space allows for the reconstruction of the salt and
subsalt structures with a high fidelity.
