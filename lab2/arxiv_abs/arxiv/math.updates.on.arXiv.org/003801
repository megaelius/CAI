This article is a part of a project investigating the relationship between the dynamics of completely
integrable or close to completely integrable billiard tables, the integral geometry on them, and
the spectrum of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operators. It is concerned with new isospectral
invariants and with the spectral rigidity problem for families of Laplace-Beltrami operators
with Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary conditions, associated with C^1 families of billiard
tables. We introduce a notion of weak isospectrality for such deformations. The main dynamical
assumption on the initial billiard table is that the corresponding billiard ball map or an iterate
of it has a Kronecker invariant torus with a Diophantine frequency and that the corresponding Birkhoff
Normal Form is nondegenerate in Kolmogorov sense. Then we obtain C^1 families of Kronecker tori
with Diophantine frequencies. If the family of the Laplace-Beltrami operators satisfies the weak
isospectral condition, we prove that the average action on the tori and the Birkhoff Normal Form
of the billiard ball maps remain the same along the perturbation. As an application we obtain infinitesimal
spectral rigidity for Liouville billiard tables in dimensions two and three. Applications are
obtained also for strictly convex billiard tables of dimension two as well as in the case when the
initial billiard table admits an elliptic periodic billiard trajectory. Spectral rigidity of
billard tables close elliptical billiard tables is obtained. The results are based on a construction
of C^1 families of quasi-modes associated with the Kronecker tori and on suitable KAM theorems for
C^1 families of Hamiltonians.
