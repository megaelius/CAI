The algebras $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ have been introduced by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus and
Buffenoir-Roche in the middle of the 1990's, in the program of combinatorial quantization of the
moduli space of flat connections over the surface $\Sigma_{g,n}$ of genus $g$ with $n$ open disks
removed. In this thesis we apply these algebras $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ to low-dimensional topology
(mapping class groups and skein algebras of surfaces), under the assumption that the gauge algebra
$H$ is a finite dimensional factorizable ribbon Hopf algebra which is not necessarily semisimple,
the guiding example being the restricted quantum group $\bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ (where $q$
is a $2p$-th root of unity). First, we construct from $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ a projective representation
of the mapping class group of $\Sigma_{g,0}$. We provide formulas for the representations of Dehn
twists generating the mapping class group and we use these formulas to show that our representation
is equivalent to the one constructed by Lyubashenko--Majid and Lyubashenko via categorical methods.
For the torus $\Sigma_{1,0}$ with the gauge algebra $\bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, we compute explicitly
the representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and we determine its structure. Second, we
introduce a diagrammatic description of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ which enables us to define in
a very natural way the Wilson loop map $W$. This map associates an element of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$
to any link in $(\Sigma_{g,n} \!\setminus\! D) \times [0,1]$ which is framed, oriented and colored
by $H$-modules. When the gauge algebra is $H = \bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, we use $W$ and the representations
of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}(H)$ to construct representations of the skein algebras $\mathcal{S}_q(\Sigma_{g,n})$
for $q$ a $2p$-th root of unity. For the torus $\Sigma_{1,0}$ we explicitly study this representation.
