We solve Pad\'e- and Prony interpolation problems for the sums $$H_n(z)=\frac{\mu}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n
h(\lambda_k z),\;\text{where}\;\mu,\lambda_k\in \mathbb{C},$$ and $h$ is a fixed analytic
function under few natural assumptions. The interpolation of a function $f$ by $H_n$ is due to properly
chosen $\mu$ and $\lambda_k$, depending on $f$, $h$ and $n$. The sums $H_n$ are related to the $h$-sums
and amplitude and frequency sums, i.e. $$\mathcal{H}^*_n(z)=\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k h(\lambda_k
z)\;\text{and}\;\mathcal{H}_n(z)=\sum_{k=1}^n \mu_k h(\lambda_k z),\;\text{where}\;\mu_k,\lambda_k\in
\mathbb{C},$$ which generalise many classical approximants and whose properties are actively
studied. It can be noticed that calculating $H_n$ requires notably less arithmetic operations
than of $\mathcal{H}_n^*$ and $\mathcal{H}_n$, and this is one of our motivation points. As for
the Pad\'e problem, we show that $H_n$ and $\mathcal{H}_n^*$ have similar constructions and interpolation
rates, whereas $H_n$ are less expensive computationally. Although the Pad\'e problem for $\mathcal{H}_n$
is known to have a doubled interpolation rate with respect to $\mathcal{H}_n^*$ and thus to $H_n$,
it can be however unsolvable in many useful cases and this may entirely eliminate the advantage of
$\mathcal{H}_n$. We show that, in contrast to $\mathcal{H}_n$, the Pad\'e problem for $H_n$ always
has a unique solution. What is more important, we also obtain several estimates for $\mu$ and $\lambda_k$,
valuable by themselves, and use them to evaluate interpolation quality. The Pad\'e problem solution
and the above-mentioned estimates provide a basis for managing the more interesting Prony problem
for $H_n$ with $h(z)=\exp(z)$. We show that it is uniquely solvable and surprisingly $\mu$ and $\lambda_k$
can be efficiently estimated. This is in sharp contrast to the case of $\mathcal{H}_n$ that was widely
studied before.
