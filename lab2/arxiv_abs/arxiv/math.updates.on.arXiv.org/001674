To estimate the growth rate of matrix products $A_{n}\cdots A_{1}$ with factors from some set of
matrices $\mathcal{A}$, such numeric quantities as the joint spectral radius $\rho(\mathcal{A})$
and the lower spectral radius $\check{\rho}(\mathcal{A})$ are traditionally used. The first
of these quantities characterizes the maximum growth rate of the norms of the corresponding products,
while the second one characterizes the minimal growth rate. In the theory of discrete-time linear
switching systems, the inequality $\rho(\mathcal{A})<1$ serves as a criterion for the stability
of a system, and the inequality $\check{\rho}(\mathcal{A})<1 $ as a criterion for stabilizability.
For matrix products $A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}$ with factors $A_{i}\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B_{i}\in\mathcal{B}$,
where $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are some sets of matrices, we introduce the quantities $\mu(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$
and $\eta(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$, called the lower and upper minimax joint spectral radius
of the pair $\{\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}\}$, respectively, which characterize the maximum growth
rate of the matrix products $A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}$ over all sets of matrices $A_{i}\in\mathcal{A}$
and the minimal growth rate over all sets of matrices $B_{i}\in\mathcal{B}$. In this sense, the
minimax joint spectral radii can be considered as generalizations of both the joint and lower spectral
radii. As an application of the minimax joint spectral radii, it is shown how these quantities can
be used to analyze the stabilizability of discrete-time linear switching control systems in the
presence of uncontrolled external disturbances of the plant.
