Proof nets for MLL (unit-free Multiplicative Linear Logic) are concise graphical representations
of proofs which are canonical in the sense that they abstract away syntactic redundancy such as the
order of non-interacting rules. We argue that Girard's extension to MLL1 (first-order MLL) fails
to be canonical because of redundant existential witnesses, and present canonical MLL1 proof nets
called unification nets without them. For example, while there are infinitely many cut-free Girard
nets $\forall x Px \vdash \exists xPx$, one per arbitrary choice of witness for $\exists x$, there
is a unique cut-free unification net, with no specified witness. Redundant existential witnesses
cause Girard's MLL1 nets to suffer from severe complexity issues: (1) cut elimination is non-local
and exponential-time (and -space), and (2) some sequents require exponentially large cut-free
Girard nets. Unification nets solve both problems: (1) cut elimination is local and linear-time,
and (2) cut-free unification nets grow linearly with the size of the sequent. Since some unification
nets are exponentially smaller than corresponding Girard nets and sequent proofs, technical delicacy
is required to ensure correctness is polynomial-time (quadratic). These results extend beyond
MLL1 via a broader methodological insight: for canonical quantifiers, the standard parallel/sequential
dichotomy of proof nets fails; an implicit/explicit witness dichotomy is also needed. Work in progress
extends unification nets to additives and uses them to extend combinatorial proofs [Proofs without
syntax, Annals of Mathematics, 2006] to classical first-order logic.
