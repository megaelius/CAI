Motivated by the calculation of correlation functions in inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1d)
quantum systems, the 2d Inhomogeneous Gaussian Free Field (IGFF) is studied and solved. The IGFF
is defined in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ equipped with a conformal class of metrics
$[{\rm g}]$ and with a real positive coupling constant $K: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{>0}$
by the action $\mathcal{S}[h] = \frac{1}{8\pi } \int_\Omega \frac{\sqrt{{\rm g}} d^2 {\rm x}}{K({\rm
x})} \, {\rm g}^{i j} (\partial_i h)(\partial_j h)$. All correlations functions of the IGFF are
expressible in terms of the Green's functions of generalized Poisson operators that are familiar
from 2d electrostatics in media with spatially varying dielectric constants. This formalism is
then applied to the study of ground state correlations of the Lieb-Liniger gas trapped in an external
potential $V(x)$. Relations with previous works on inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids are discussed.
The main innovation here is in the identification of local observables $\hat{O} (x)$ in the microscopic
model with their field theory counterparts $\partial_x h, e^{i h(x)}, e^{-i h(x)}$, etc., which
involve non-universal coefficients that themselves depend on position --- a fact that, to the best
of our knowledge, was overlooked in previous works on correlation functions of inhomogeneous Luttinger
liquids ---, and that can be calculated thanks to Bethe Ansatz form factors formulae available for
the homogeneous Lieb-Liniger model. Combining those position-dependent coefficients with the
correlation functions of the IGFF, ground state correlation functions of the trapped gas are obtained.
Numerical checks from DMRG are provided for density-density correlations and for the one-particle
density matrix, showing excellent agreement.
