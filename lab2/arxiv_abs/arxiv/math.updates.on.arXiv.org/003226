We apply our new approach of quantum Separation of Variables (SoV) to the complete characterization
of the transfer matrix spectrum of quantum integrable lattice models associated to gl(n)-invariant
R-matrices in the fundamental representations. We consider lattices with N sites and quasi-periodic
boundary conditions associated to an arbitrary twist K having simple spectrum (but not necessarily
diagonalizable). In our approach the SoV basis is constructed in an universal manner starting from
the direct use of the conserved charges of the models, i.e., from the commuting family of transfer
matrices. Using the integrable structure of the models, incarnated in the hierarchy of transfer
matrices fusion relations, we prove that our SoV basis indeed separates the spectrum of the corresponding
transfer matrices. Moreover, the combined use of the fusion rules, of the known analytic properties
of the transfer matrices and of the SoV basis allows us to obtain the complete characterization of
the transfer matrix spectrum and to prove its simplicity. Any transfer matrix eigenvalue is completely
characterized as a solution of a so-called quantum spectral curve equation that we obtain as a difference
functional equation of order n. Namely, any eigenvalue satisfies this equation and any solution
of this equation having prescribed properties leads to an eigenvalue. We construct the associated
eigenvector, unique up to normalization, by computing its decomposition on the SoV basis that is
of a factorized form written in terms of the powers of the corresponding eigenvalues. If the twist
matrix K is diagonalizable with simple spectrum then the transfer matrix is also diagonalizable
with simple spectrum. In that case, we give a construction of the Baxter Q-operator satisfying a
T-Q equation of order n, the quantum spectral curve equation, involving the hierarchy of the fused
transfer matrices.
