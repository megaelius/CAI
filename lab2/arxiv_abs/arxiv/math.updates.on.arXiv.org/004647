We study how generalized Jones $\beta$-numbers relate to harmonic measure. Firstly, we generalize
a result of Garnett, Mourgoglou and Tolsa by showing that domains in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ whose boundaries
are lower $d$-content regular admit Corona decompositions for harmonic measure if and only if the
square sum $\beta_{\partial\Omega}$ of the generalized Jones $\beta$-numbers is finite. Secondly,
for semi-uniform domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries, it is known that uniform rectifiability
implies harmonic measure is $A_{\infty}$ for semi-uniform domains, but now we give more explicit
dependencies on the $A_{\infty}$-constant in terms of the uniform rectifiability constant. This
follows from a more general estimate that does not assume the boundary to be uniformly rectifiable.
For general semi-uniform domains, we also show how to bound the harmonic measure of a subset in terms
of that sets Hausdorff measure and the square sum of $\beta$-numbers on that set. Using this, we give
estimates on the fluctuation of Green's function in a uniform domain in terms of the $\beta$-numbers.
As a corollary, for bounded NTA domains , if $B_{\Omega}=B(x_{\Omega},c\mathrm{diam} \Omega)$
is so that $2B_{\Omega}\subseteq \Omega$, we obtain that \[ (\mathrm{diam} \partial\Omega)^{d}
+ \int_{\Omega\backslash B_{\Omega}} \left|\frac{\nabla^2 G_{\Omega}(x_{\Omega},x)}{G_{\Omega}(x_{\Omega},x)}\right|^{2}
\mathrm{dist}(x,\Omega^c)^{3} dx \sim \mathscr{H}^{d}(\partial\Omega). \] Secondly, we also
use $\beta$-numbers to estimate how much harmonic measure fails to be $A_{\infty}$-weight for
semi-uniform domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries.
