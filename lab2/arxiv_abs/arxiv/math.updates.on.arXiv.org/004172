We establish mean-field limits for large-scale random-access networks with buffer dynamics and
arbitrary interference graphs. While saturated-buffer scenarios have been widely investigated
and yield useful throughput estimates for persistent sessions, they fail to capture the fluctuations
in buffer contents over time, and provide no insight in the delay performance of flows with intermittent
packet arrivals. Motivated by that issue, we explore in the present paper random-access networks
with buffer dynamics, where flows with empty buffers refrain from competition for the medium. The
occurrence of empty buffers thus results in a complex dynamic interaction between activity states
and buffer contents, which severely complicates the performance analysis. Hence we focus on a many-sources
regime where the total number of nodes grows large, which not only offers mathematical tractability
but is also highly relevant with the densification of wireless networks as the Internet of Things
emerges. We exploit time scale separation properties to prove that the properly scaled buffer occupancy
process converges to the solution of a deterministic initial-value problem, and establish the
existence and uniqueness of the associated fixed point. This approach simplifies the performance
analysis of networks with huge numbers of nodes to a low-dimensional fixed-point calculation.
For the case of a complete interference graph, we demonstrate asymptotic stability, provide a simple
closed-form expression for the fixed point, and prove interchange of the mean-field and steady-state
limits. This yields asymptotically exact approximations for key performance metrics, in particular
the stationary buffer content and packet delay distributions. The methodological framework that
we develop easily extends to various model refinements as will be illustrated by several examples.
