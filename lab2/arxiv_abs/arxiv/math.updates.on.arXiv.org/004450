We utilize the externally forced linearized Navier-Stokes equations to study the receptivity
of pre-transitional boundary layers to persistent sources of stochastic excitation. Stochastic
forcing is used to model the effect of free-stream turbulence that enters at various wall-normal
locations and the fluctuation dynamics are studied via linearized models that arise from locally
parallel and global perspectives. In contrast to the widely used resolvent analysis that quantifies
the amplification of deterministic disturbances at a given temporal frequency, our approach examines
the steady-state response to stochastic excitation that is uncorrelated in time. In addition to
stochastic forcing with identity covariance, we utilize the spatial spectrum of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence to model the effect of free-stream turbulence. Even though locally parallel analysis
does not account for the effect of the spatially evolving base flow, we demonstrate that it captures
the essential mechanisms and the prevailing length-scales in stochastically forced boundary
layer flows. On the other hand, global analysis, which accounts for the spatially evolving nature
of the boundary layer flow, predicts the amplification of a cascade of streamwise scales throughout
the streamwise domain. We show that the flow structures that can be extracted from a modal decomposition
of the resulting velocity covariance matrix, can be closely captured by conducting locally parallel
analysis at various streamwise locations and over different wall-parallel wavenumber pairs.
Our approach does not rely on costly stochastic simulations and it provides insight into mechanisms
for perturbation growth including the interaction of the slowly varying base flow with streaks
and Tollmien-Schlichting waves.
