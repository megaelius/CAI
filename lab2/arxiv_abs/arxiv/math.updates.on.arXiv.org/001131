We associate invariants such as permutation cycles and local cycles at infinity with $2-$standard
consecutive structures (refer Definition $23$) to a line arrangement (refer Definition $2$) which
has global cyclicity (refer Definition $19$) over fields with $1-ad$ structure (refer Definition
$1$) to describe the gonality structures (refer Definition $8$) in Theorem $11$ when there exists
a local permutation chart where the intersections points corresponding to simple transpositions
satisfy One Sided Property $11$. While generalizing the features of a finite set of linear inequalities
in two variables we compute modified simplicial homology groups of line arrangements over arbitrary
fields in Theorem $2$ and ask Question $1$ about associating spaces which describe these invariant
homology groups. In this article we could associate regions (refer Definition $5$) describing
these invariants over fields with $1-ad$ structure. We construct a graph of isomorphism of classes
of line arrangements over fields with $1-ad$ structure using the associated invariants and Elementary
Collineation Transformations (ECT) in Theorem $13$ and in Note $11$. Here we prove a representation
Theorem $13$ where we represent each isomorphism class with a given set of distinct slopes. We also
prove a formulation of Polygonal Jordan Curve Theorem $3$ over fields with $1-ad$ structure and
an isomorphism Theorem $14$ for those line arrangement collineation maps which preserve nook points
and central pairs for quadrilateral substructures (refer Definition $30$). At the end of the article
we ask some open questions on line-folds (refer Definition $31$).
