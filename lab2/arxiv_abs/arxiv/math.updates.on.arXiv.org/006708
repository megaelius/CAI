Nonlocal and fractional models capture effects that classical (or standard) partial differential
equations cannot describe; for this reason, they are suitable for a broad class of engineering and
scientific applications that feature multiscale or anomalous behavior. This has driven a desire
for a vector calculus based on nonlocal and fractional derivatives to derive models of, e.g., subsurface
transport, turbulence, and conservation laws. In the literature, several independent definitions
and theories of nonlocal and fractional vector calculus have been put forward. Some have been studied
rigorously and in depth, while others have been introduced ad-hoc for specific applications. At
the moment, this fragmented literature suffers from a lack of rigorous comparison and unified notation,
hindering the development of nonlocal modeling. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide a new
theory and to "connect all the dots" by defining a universal form of nonlocal vector calculus operators
under a theory that includes, as a special case, several well-known proposals for fractional vector
calculus in the limit of infinite interactions. We show that this formulation enjoys a form of Green's
identity, enabling a unified variational theory for the resulting nonlocal exterior-value problems,
and is consistent with several independent results in the fractional calculus literature. The
proposed unified vector calculus has the potential to go beyond the analysis of nonlocal equations
by supporting new model discovery, establishing theory and interpretation for a broad class of
operators and providing useful analogues of standard tools from classical vector calculus.
