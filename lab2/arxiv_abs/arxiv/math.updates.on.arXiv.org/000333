In the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping industry, the phenomenon of sloshing can lead to the
occurrence of very high pressures in the tanks of the vessel. The issue of modelling or estimating
the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the
risk assessment point of view. In this paper, heavy-tail modelling, widely used as a conservative
approach to risk assessment and corresponding to a worst-case risk analysis, is applied to the study
of sloshing. Multivariate heavy-tailed distributions are considered, with Sloshing pressures
investigated by means of small-scale replica tanks instrumented with d >1 sensors. When attempting
to fit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational issues inherent
in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of this article is to overcome this barrier
by introducing a novel methodology. For d-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions, the structure
of extremal dependence is entirely characterised by the angular measure, a positive measure on
the intersection of a sphere with the positive orthant in Rd. As d increases, the mutual extremal
dependence between variables becomes difficult to assess. Based on a spectral clustering approach,
we show here how a low dimensional approximation to the angular measure may be found. The nonparametric
method proposed for model sloshing has been successfully applied to pressure data. The parsimonious
representation thus obtained proves to be very convenient for the simulation of multivariate heavy-tailed
distributions, allowing for the implementation of Monte-Carlo simulation schemes in estimating
the probability of failure. Besides confirming its performance on artificial data, the methodology
has been implemented on a real data set specifically collected for risk assessment of sloshing in
the LNG shipping industry.
