Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a metric space with doubling measure and $L$ a one-to-one operator of type $\omega$
having a bounded $H_\infty$-functional calculus in $L^2(\mathcal{X})$ satisfying the reinforced
$(p_L, q_L)$ off-diagonal estimates on balls, where $p_L\in[1,2)$ and $q_L\in(2,\infty]$. Let
$\varphi:\,\mathcal{X}\times[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ be a function such that $\varphi(x,\cdot)$
is an Orlicz function, $\varphi(\cdot,t)\in {\mathbb A}_{\infty}(\mathcal{X})$ (the class
of uniformly Muckenhoupt weights), its uniformly critical upper type index $I(\varphi)\in(0,1]$
and $\varphi(\cdot,t)$ satisfies the uniformly reverse H\"older inequality of order $(q_L/I(\varphi))'$.
In this paper, the authors introduce a Musielak-Orlicz-Hardy space $H_{\varphi,\,L}(\mathcal{X})$,
via the Lusin-area function associated with $L$, and establish its molecular characterization.
In particular, when $L$ is nonnegative self-adjoint and satisfies the Davies-Gaffney estimates,
the atomic characterization of $H_{\varphi,\,L}(\mathcal{X})$ is also obtained. Furthermore,
a sufficient condition for the equivalence between $H_{\varphi,\,L}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and the
classical Musielak-Orlicz-Hardy space $H_{\varphi}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is given. Moreover, for
the Musielak-Orlicz-Hardy space $H_{\varphi,\,L}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ associated with the second
order elliptic operator in divergence form on $\rn$ or the Schr\"odinger operator $L:=-\Delta+V$
with $0\le V\in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the authors further obtain its several equivalent
characterizations in terms of various non-tangential and radial maximal functions; finally,
the authors discuss the boundedness of the Riesz transform $\nabla L^{-1/2}$.
