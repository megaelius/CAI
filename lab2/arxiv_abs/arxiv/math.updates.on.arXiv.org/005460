A subcategory of an abelian category is wide if it is closed under sums, summands, kernels, cokernels,
and extensions. Wide subcategories provide a significant interface between representation theory
and combinatorics. If $\Phi$ is a finite dimensional algebra, then each functorially finite wide
subcategory of $\operatorname{mod}( \Phi )$ is of the form $\phi_{ * }\big( \operatorname{mod}(
\Gamma ) \big)$ in an essentially unique way, where $\Gamma$ is a finite dimensional algebra and
$\Phi \stackrel{ \phi }{ \longrightarrow } \Gamma$ is an algebra epimorphism satisfying $\operatorname{Tor}^{
\Phi }_1( \Gamma,\Gamma ) = 0$. Let ${\mathcal F} \subseteq \operatorname{mod}( \Phi )$ be a $d$-cluster
tilting subcategory as defined by Iyama. Then ${\mathcal F}$ is a $d$-abelian category as defined
by Jasso, and we call a subcategory of ${\mathcal F}$ wide if it is closed under sums, summands, $d$-kernels,
$d$-cokernels, and $d$-extensions. We generalise the above description of wide subcategories
to this setting: Each functorially finite wide subcategory of ${\mathcal F}$ is of the form $\phi_{
* }( {\mathcal G} )$ in an essentially unique way, where $\Phi \stackrel{ \phi }{ \longrightarrow
} \Gamma$ is an algebra epimorphism satisfying $\operatorname{Tor}^{ \Phi }_d( \Gamma,\Gamma
) = 0$, and ${\mathcal G} \subseteq \operatorname{mod}( \Gamma )$ is a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory.
We illustrate the theory by computing the wide subcategories of some $d$-cluster tilting subcategories
${\mathcal F} \subseteq \operatorname{mod}( \Phi )$ over algebras of the form $\Phi = kA_m / (\operatorname{rad}\,kA_m
)^{ \ell }$.
