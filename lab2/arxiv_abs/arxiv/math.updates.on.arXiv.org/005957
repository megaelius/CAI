This is the second in a trilogy of papers introducing and studying the notion of decomposition space
as a general framework for incidence algebras and M\"obius inversion, with coefficients in $\infty$-groupoids.
A decomposition space is a simplicial $\infty$-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition weaker
than the Segal condition. Just as the Segal condition expresses composition, the new condition
expresses decomposition. In this paper, we introduce various technical conditions on decomposition
spaces. The first is a completeness condition (weaker than Rezk completeness), needed to control
simplicial nondegeneracy. For complete decomposition spaces we establish a general M\"obius
inversion principle, expressed as an explicit equivalence of $\infty$-groupoids. Next we analyse
two finiteness conditions on decomposition spaces. The first, that of locally finite length, guarantees
the existence of the important length filtration on the associated incidence coalgebra. We show
that a decomposition space of locally finite length is actually the left Kan extension of a semi-simplicial
space. The second finiteness condition, local finiteness, ensures we can take homotopy cardinality
to pass from the level of $\infty$-groupoids to the level of vector spaces. These three conditions
- completeness, locally finite length, and local finiteness - together define our notion of M\"obius
decomposition space, which extends Leroux's notion of M\"obius category (in turn a common generalisation
of the locally finite posets of Rota et al. and of the finite decomposition monoids of Cartier-Foata),
but which also covers many coalgebra constructions which do not arise from M\"obius categories,
such as the Fa\`a di Bruno and Connes-Kreimer bialgebras. Note: The notion of decomposition space
was arrived at independently by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov (arXiv:1212.3563) who call them unital
2-Segal spaces.
