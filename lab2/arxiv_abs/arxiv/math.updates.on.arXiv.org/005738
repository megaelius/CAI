The system decomposition theory has recently been developed for the dynamic analysis of nonlinear
compartmental systems. The application of this theory to the ecosystem analysis has also been introduced
in a separate article. Based on this methodology, multiple new dynamic ecological system measures
and indices of matrix, vector, and scalar types are systematically introduced in the present paper.
These mathematical system analysis tools are quantitative ecological indicators that monitor
the flow distribution and storage organization, quantify the direct, indirect, acyclic, cycling,
and transfer (diact) effects and utilities of one compartment on another, identify the system efficiencies
and stress, measure the compartmental exposures to system flows, determine the residence times
and compartmental activity levels, and ascertain the system resilience and resistance in the case
of disturbances. The proposed dynamic system measures and indices, thus, extract detailed information
about ecosystems' characteristics, as well as their functions, properties, behaviors, and various
other system attributes that are potentially hidden in and even obscured by data. A dynamic technique
for the quantitative characterization and classification of main interspecific interactions
and the determination of their strength within food webs is also developed based on the diact effect
and utility indices. Moreover, major concepts and quantities in the current static network analyses
are also extended to nonlinear dynamic settings and integrated with the proposed dynamic measures
and indices in this unifying mathematical framework. We consider that the proposed methodology
brings a novel complex system theory to the service of urgent and challenging environmental problems
of the day and has the potential to lead the way to a more formalistic ecological science.
