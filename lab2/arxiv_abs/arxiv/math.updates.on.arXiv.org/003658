In many engineered systems, optimization is used for decision making at time-scales ranging from
real-time operation to long-term planning. This process often involves solving similar optimization
problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under tight latency
requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this repeated
solution process to directly learn a model of the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters,
thus reducing the need to solve computationally expensive large-scale parametric programs in
real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active constraints, from which
the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information
about the physics of the system, enables interpretable models, accounts for relevant safety constraints,
and is easy to represent and encode. However, the total number of active sets is also very large, as
it grows exponentially with system size. The key contribution of this paper is a streaming algorithm
that learns the relevant active sets from training samples consisting of the input parameters and
the corresponding optimal solution, without any assumptions on the problem structure. The algorithm
comes with theoretical performance guarantees, and is known to converge fast for problem instances
with a small number of relevant active sets. It can thus be used to establish the practicability of
the learning method. Through extensive experiments on the Optimal Power Flow problem, we observe
that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that the active sets is the
appropriate level of abstraction for a learning algorithm to target.
