This paper describes an investigation of the acoustic properties of a rigid plate with a periodic
pattern of holes, in a compressible, ideal, inviscid fluid in the absence of mean flow. Leppington
and Levine (J. Fluid Mech., 1973) obtained an approximation of the reflection and transmission
coefficients of a plane wave incident on an infinitely thin plate with a rectangular array of perforations,
assuming that a characteristic size of the perforations is negligible relative to that of the unit
cell of the grating, itself assumed to be negligible relative to the wavelength. One part of the present
study is of methodological interest. It establishes that it is possible to extend their approach
to thick plates with a skew grating of perforations, thus confirming recent results in Bendali et
al. (SIAM J. Appl. Math., 2013), but in a much simpler way without using complex matched asymptotic
expansions of the full wave or to a grating of multipoles. As is well-known, effective compliances
for the plate can then be derived from the corresponding approximations of the reflection and transmission
coefficients. These compliances are expressed in terms of the Rayleigh conductivity of an isolated
perforation. Consequently, in one other part of the present study, the methodology recently introduced
in Laurens et al. (ESAIM:M2AN, 2013) to obtain sharp bounds for the Rayleigh conductivity has been
extended to include the case for which the openings of the perforations on the upper and lower sides
of the plate are elliptical in shape. This not only enables the determination of these bounds and
of the associated reflection and transmission coefficients for actual plates with tilted perforations
but also yields single expressions covering all usual cases of perforations: straight or tilted
with a circular or an elliptical cross-section.
