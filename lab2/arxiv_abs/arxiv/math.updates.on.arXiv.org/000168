Two concepts, very different in nature, have proved to be useful in analytical and numerical studies
of spectral stability: (i) the Krein signature of an eigenvalue, a quantity usually defined in terms
of the relative orientation of certain subspaces that is capable of detecting the structural instability
of imaginary eigenvalues and hence their potential for moving into the right half-plane leading
to dynamical instability under perturbation of the system, and (ii) the Evans function, an analytic
function detecting the location of eigenvalues. One might expect these two concepts to be related,
but unfortunately examples demonstrate that there is no way in general to deduce the Krein signature
of an eigenvalue from the Evans function. The purpose of this paper is to recall and popularize a simple
graphical interpretation of the Krein signature well-known in the spectral theory of polynomial
operator pencils. This interpretation avoids altogether the need to view the Krein signature in
terms of root subspaces and their relation to indefinite quadratic forms. To demonstrate the utility
of this graphical interpretation of the Krein signature, we use it to define a simple generalization
of the Evans function -- the Evans-Krein function -- that allows the calculation of Krein signatures
in a way that is easy to incorporate into existing Evans function evaluation codes at virtually no
additional computational cost. The graphical Krein signature also enables us to give elegant proofs
of index theorems for linearized Hamiltonians in the finite dimensional setting: a general result
implying as a corollary the generalized Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion (or Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss
criterion) and a count of real eigenvalues for linearized Hamiltonian systems in canonical form.
These applications demonstrate how the simple graphical nature of the Krein signature may be easily
exploited.
