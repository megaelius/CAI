An optimization model has been formulated and solved to determine on-condition failure thresholds
and inspection intervals for multi-component systems with each component experiencing multiple
failure processes due to simultaneous exposure to degradation and shock loads. In this new model,
we consider on-condition maintenance optimization for systems of degrading components, which
offers cost benefits over time-based preventive maintenance or replace-on-failure policies.
For systems of degrading components, this can be a particularly difficult problem because of the
dependent degradation and dependent failure times. In previous research, preventive maintenance
and periodic inspection models have been considered; however, for systems whose costs due to failure
are high, it is prudent to avoid the event of failure, i.e., we should repair or replace the components
or system before the failure happens. The determination of optimal on-condition thresholds for
all components is effective to avoid failure and to minimize cost. Low on-condition thresholds
can be inefficient because they waste components life, and high on-condition thresholds are risky
because the components are prone to costly failure. In this paper, we formulated and solved a new
optimization model to determine optimal on-condition thresholds and inspection intervals. In
our model, when the system is inspected, all components are inspected at that time. An inspection
interval may be optimal for one component, but might be undesirable for another component, so the
optimization requires a compromise. The on-condition maintenance optimization model is demonstrated
on several examples.
