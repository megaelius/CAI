Micro-scale implantable medical devices (IMDs) extend the immense benefits of sensors used in
health management. However, their development is limited by many requirements and challenges,
such as the use of safe materials, size restrictions, safe and efficient powering, and selection
of suitable wireless communication technologies. Some of the proposed wireless communication
technologies are the terahertz (THz) radio frequency (RF), and ultrasound. This paper investigates
the use of {\em magnetic induction-based backscatter communication} as an alternative technology.
In particular, the goal is to provide a practical design for a micro-scale IMD, referred to as a "biomote"
here, that can communicate with a wearable or handheld device such as a cell phone, tablet, or smart
watch.First, it is demonstrated that communication via magnetic induction can be established
between a biomote and such an external reader. Then, low-power modulation and error-correction
coding schemes that can be implemented in micro-scale are explored for the mote. With the aim of increasing
reliability and accuracy of measurements through mass deployment of biomotes, suitable low-power
media access control (MAC) schemes are proposed, and the feasibility of their implementation in
micro-scale is highlighted. Next, assuming that the human body is an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel, the performance of the mote is simulated and analyzed. Results of this analysis
asserts that a communication range of at least few centimeters is achievable with an acceptable
bit error rate. Finally, from the analysis of the MAC schemes, the optimum number of motes to be deployed
for various read delays and transmission rates is obtained.
