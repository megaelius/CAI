We prove a range of new sum-product type growth estimates over a general field $\mathbb{F}$, in particular
the special case $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_p$. They are unified by the theme of "breaking the $3/2$
threshold", epitomising the previous state of the art. These estimates stem from specially suited
applications of incidence bounds over $\mathbb{F}$, which apply to higher moments of representation
functions. We establish the estimate $|R[A]| \gtrsim |A|^{8/5}$ for cardinality of the set $R[A]$
of distinct cross-ratios defined by triples of elements of a (sufficiently small if $\mathbb{F}$
has positive characteristic, similarly for the rest of the estimates) set $A\subset \mathbb{F}$,
pinned at infinity. The cross-ratio naturally arises in various sum-product type questions of
projective nature and is the unifying concept underlying most of our results. It enables one to take
advantage of its symmetry properties as an onset of growth of, for instance, products of difference
sets. The geometric nature of the cross-ratio enables us to break the version of the above threshold
for the minimum number of distinct triangle areas $Ouu'$, defined by points $u,u'$ of a non-collinear
point set $P\subset \mathbb{F}^2$. Another instance of breaking the threshold is showing that
if $A$ is sufficiently small and has additive doubling constant $M$, then $|AA|\gtrsim M^{-2}|A|^{14/9}$.
This result has a second moment version, which allows for new upper bounds for the number of collinear
point triples in the set $A\times A\subset \mathbb{F}^2$, the quantity often arising in applications
of geometric incidence estimates.
