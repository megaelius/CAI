The estimation of covariance operators of spatio-temporal data is in many applications only computationally
feasible under simplifying assumptions, such as separability of the covariance into strictly
temporal and spatial factors.Powerful tests for this assumption have been proposed in the literature.
However, as real world systems, such as climate data are notoriously inseparable, validating this
assumption by statistical tests, seems inherently questionable. In this paper we present an alternative
approach: By virtue of separability measures, we quantify how strongly the data's covariance operator
diverges from a separable approximation. Confidence intervals localize these measures with statistical
guarantees. This method provides users with a flexible tool, to weigh the computational gains of
a separable model against the associated increase in bias. As separable approximations we consider
the established methods of partial traces and partial products, and develop weak convergence principles
for the corresponding estimators. Moreover, we also prove such results for estimators of optimal,
separable approximations, which are arguably of most interest in applications. In particular
we present for the first time statistical inference for this object, which has been confined to estimation
previously. Besides confidence intervals, our results encompass tests for approximate separability.
All methods proposed in this paper are free of nuisance parameters and do neither require computationally
expensive resampling procedures nor the estimation of nuisance parameters. A simulation study
underlines the advantages of our approach and its applicability is demonstrated by the investigation
of German annual temperature data.
