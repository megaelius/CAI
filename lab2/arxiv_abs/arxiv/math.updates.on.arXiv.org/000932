The Kantorovich-Rubinshtein metric is an $L^1$-like metric on spaces of probability distributions
that enjoys several serendipitous properties. It is complete separable if the underlying metric
space of points is complete separable, and in that case it metrizes the weak topology. We introduce
a variant of that construction in the realm of quasi-metric spaces, and prove that it is algebraic
Yoneda-complete as soon as the underlying quasi-metric space of points is algebraic Yoneda-complete,
and that the associated topology is the weak topology. We do this not only for probability distributions,
represented as normalized continuous valuations, but also for subprobability distributions,
for various hyperspaces, and in general for different brands of functionals. Those functionals
model probabilistic choice, angelic and demonic non-deterministic choice, and their combinations.
The mathematics needed for those results are more demanding than in the simpler case of metric spaces.
To obtain our results, we prove a few other results that have independent interest, notably: continuous
Yoneda-complete spaces are consonant; on a continuous Yoneda-complete space, the Scott topology
on the space of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}_+$-valued lower semicontinuous maps coincides with the
compact-open and Isbell topologies, and the subspace topology on spaces of $\alpha$-Lipschitz
continuous maps also coincides with the topology of pointwise convergence, and is stably compact;
we introduce and study the so-called Lipschitz-regular quasi-metric spaces, and we show that the
formal ball functor induces a Kock-Z\"oberlein monad, of which all algebras are Lipschitz-regular;
and we prove a minimax theorem where one of the spaces is not compact Hausdorff, but merely compact.
