Honeybees play an important role in the production of many agricultural crops and in sustaining
plant diversity in undisturbed ecosystems. The rapid decline of honeybee populations have sparked
great concern worldwide. Previous studies have shown that the parasitic Varroa mite could be the
main reason for colony losses. In order to understand how mites affect population dynamics of honeybees
and a colony health, we propose a brood-adult bee-mite model in which the time lag from brood to adult
is taken into account. Noting that the dynamics of a honeybee colony varies with respect to season,
we validate the model and perform parameter estimations under both constant and fluctuating seasonality
scenarios. Our analytical and numerical studies reveal the following: (a) In the presence of parasite
mites, the large time lag from brood to adult could destabilize population dynamics and drive the
colony to collapse; but the small natural mortality of the adult population can promote a mite-free
colony when time lag is small or at an intermediate level; (b) Small brood' infestation rates could
stabilize all populations at the unique interior equilibrium under constant seasonality while
may drive the mite population to die out when seasonality is taken into account; (c) High brood' infestation
rates can destabilize the colony dynamics leading to population collapse depending on initial
population size under constant and seasonal conditions; (d) Results from sensitivity analysis
indicate the queen's egg-laying may have the greatest effect on colony population size. The brood
death rate and the colony size at which brood survivability is the half maximal were also shown to
be highly sensitive with an inverse correlation to the colony population size. Our results provide
insights on the effects of seasonality on the dynamics.
