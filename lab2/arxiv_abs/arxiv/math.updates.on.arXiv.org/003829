We introduce a multiscale topological description of the Megaparsec weblike cosmic matter distribution.
Betti numbers and topological persistence offer a powerful means of describing the rich connectivity
structure of the cosmic web and of its multiscale arrangement of matter and galaxies. Emanating
from algebraic topology and Morse theory, Betti numbers and persistence diagrams represent an
extension and deepening of the cosmologically familiar topological genus measure, and the related
geometric Minkowski functionals. In addition to a description of the mathematical background,
this study presents the computational procedure for computing Betti numbers and persistence diagrams
for density field filtrations. The field may be computed starting from a discrete spatial distribution
of galaxies or simulation particles. The main emphasis of this study concerns an extensive and systematic
exploration of the imprint of different weblike morphologies and different levels of multiscale
clustering in the corresponding computed Betti numbers and persistence diagrams. To this end,
we use Voronoi clustering models as templates for a rich variety of weblike configurations, and
the fractal-like Soneira-Peebles models exemplify a range of multiscale configurations. We have
identified the clear imprint of cluster nodes, filaments, walls, and voids in persistence diagrams,
along with that of the nested hierarchy of structures in multiscale point distributions. We conclude
by outlining the potential of persistent topology for understanding the connectivity structure
of the cosmic web, in large simulations of cosmic structure formation and in the challenging context
of the observed galaxy distribution in large galaxy surveys.
