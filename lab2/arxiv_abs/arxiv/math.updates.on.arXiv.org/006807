Directional transmission patterns (a.k.a. narrow beams) are the key to wireless communications
in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands which suffer from high path loss and severe shadowing.
In addition, the propagation channel in mmWave frequencies incorporates only a few number of spatial
clusters requiring a procedure to align the corresponding narrow beams with the angle of departure
(AoD) of the channel clusters. The objective of this procedure, called beam alignment (BA) is to
increase the beamforming gain for subsequent data communication. Several prior studies consider
optimizing BA procedure to achieve various objectives such as reducing the BA overhead, increasing
throughput, and reducing power consumption. While these studies mostly provide optimized BA schemes
for scenarios with a single active user, there are often multiple active users in practical networks.
Consequently, it is more efficient in terms of BA overhead and delay to design multi-user BA schemes
which can perform beam management for multiple users collectively. This paper considers a class
of multi-user BA schemes where the base station performs a one shot scan of the angular domain to simultaneously
localize multiple users. The objective is to minimize the average of expected width of remaining
uncertainty regions (UR) on the AoDs after receiving users' feedbacks. Fundamental bounds on the
optimal performance are analyzed using information theoretic tools. Furthermore, a beam design
optimization problem is formulated and a practical BA scheme, which provides significant gains
compared to the beam sweeping used in 5G standard is proposed.
