Many electronic systems exhibit striking features in their dynamical response over a prominent
range of experimental parameters. While there are empirical suggestions of particular increasing
length scales that accompany such transitions, this identification is not universal. To better
understand such behavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in stochastic,
or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature classical Fokker-Planck systems
and related quantum systems at zero temperature to include general non-equilibrium dynamics.
Unlike Feynman mappings or stochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities),
the classical systems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of space-time
dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation relates (i) dynamics in general
finite temperature classical dissipative systems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding
dual many-body quantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the absence
of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible lattice counterparts)
may exhibit a zero-point "quantum dynamical heterogeneity" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant,
is spatially non-uniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not exhibit
a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale of the dynamical heterogeneities
can increase dramatically. We study "quantum jamming" and illustrate how a hard core bosonic system
may undergo a zero temperature quantum critical metal-to-insulator-type transition with an extremely
large effective dynamical exponent z>4 consistent with length scales that increase far more
slowly than the relaxation time as a putative critical transition is approached. We suggest ways
to analyze experimental data.
