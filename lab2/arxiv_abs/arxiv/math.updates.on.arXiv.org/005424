Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space of dimension $n$ and let $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$
be the boson Fock space over $\mathcal{H}$. A unitary operator $U$ in $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$ is
called a $n$-mode gaussian symmetry if, for every gaussian state $\rho$ in $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$,
the transformed state $U\rho U^\dagger$ is also gaussian. It is shown that every gaussian symmetry
admits a Klauder-Bargmann integral representation in terms of coherent states. This construction
provides an explicit strongly continuous, irreducible, and projective unitary representation
of the Lie group which is the semidirect product of the additive group $\mathcal{H}$ and the group
$Sp(\mathcal{H})$ of all real linear symplectic transformations of $\mathcal{H}$. For any bounded
operator $Z$ in $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$, the notion of a generating function $G_Z(u,v)$ with $u,
v$ in $\mathcal{H}$ is introduced by using the matrix entries of $Z$ in the overcomplete basis of
exponential vectors. The generating functions of gaussian symmetries and gaussian states are
explicitly computed. It is shown that such symmetries and states belong to a semigroup $\mathcal{E}_2(\mathcal{H})$
of operators in $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$, in which every element $Z$ is completely determined by
its matrix entries at $0, 1$ and $2$-particle vectors in a complete orthonormal basis of $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$
consisting of finite particle vectors. This leads to some remarks on the role of generating functions
in the tomography of gaussian states. The notion of generating function yields an algorithm for
constructing all mean zero pure gaussian states in a finite particle basis. The same algorithm leads
to the construction of a heirarchy of mean zero, pure gaussian states which are completely entangled
and symmetric under the action of the permutation group on the set of modes.
