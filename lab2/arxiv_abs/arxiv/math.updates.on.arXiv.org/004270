The motivation for this paper is the study of arithmetic properties of Shimura varieties, in particular
the Newton stratification of the special fiber of a suitable integral model at a prime with parahoric
level structure. This is closely related to the structure of Rapoport-Zink spaces and of affine
Deligne-Lusztig varieties. We prove a Hodge-Newton decomposition for affine Deligne-Lusztig
varieties and for the special fibres of Rapoport-Zink spaces, relating these spaces to analogous
ones defined in terms of Levi subgroups, under a certain condition (Hodge-Newton decomposability)
which can be phrased in combinatorial terms. Second, we study the Shimura varieties in which every
non-basic $\sigma$-isogeny class is Hodge-Newton decomposable. We show that (assuming the axioms
of \cite{HR}) this condition is equivalent to nice conditions on either the basic locus, or on all
the non-basic Newton strata of the Shimura varieties. We also give a complete classification of
Shimura varieties satisfying these conditions. While previous results along these lines often
have restrictions to hyperspecial (or at least maximal parahoric) level structure, and/or quasi-split
underlying group, we handle the cases of arbitrary parahoric level structure, and of possibly non-quasi-split
underlying groups. This results in a large number of new cases of Shimura varieties where a simple
description of the basic locus can be expected. As a striking consequence of the results, we obtain
that this property is independent of the parahoric subgroup chosen as level structure. We expect
that our conditions are closely related to the question whether the weakly admissible and admissible
loci coincide.
