This paper deals with a multiple version of zeta- and L-functions both in the complex case and in the
p-adic case: [I] Our motivation in the complex case is to find suitable rigorous meaning of the values
of multivariable multiple zeta-functions (MZFs) at non-positive integer points. (a) We reveal
that MZFs turn to be entire on the whole space after taking the desingularization. Further we show
that the desingularized function is given by a suitable finite linear combination of MZFs with some
arguments shifted. It is also shown that specific combinations of Bernoulli numbers attain the
special values at their non-positive integers of the desingularized ones. (b) Twisted MZFs can
be continued to entire functions and their special values at non-positive integer points can be
explicitly calculated. [II] Our work in the p-adic case is to develop the study on analytic side of
the Kubota-Leopoldt p-adic L-functions (pLFs) into the multiple setting. We construct p-adic
multiple L-functions (pMLFs), multivariable versions of their pLFs, by using a specific p-adic
measure. We establish their various fundamental properties: (a) We establish their intimate connection
with the above complex MZFs by showing that the special values of pMLFs at non-positive integers
are expressed by the twisted multiple Bernoulli numbers, the special values of the complex MZFs
at non-positive integers. (b) We extend Kummer congruence for Bernoulli numbers to congruences
for the twisted multiple Bernoulli numbers. (c) We extend the vanishing property of the Kubota-Leopoldt
pLFs with odd characters to our pMLFs. (d) We establish their close relationship with the p-adic
twisted multiple polylogarithms (pTMPLs) by showing that the special values of pMLFs at positive
integers are described by those of pTMPLs at roots of unity, which generalizes the previous result
of Coleman in the single variable case.
