There is evidence that ice age cycles are paced by astronomical forcing, suggesting some kind of
synchronisation phenomenon. Here, we identify the type of such synchronisation and explore systematically
its uniqueness and robustness using a simple paleoclimate model akin to the van der Pol relaxation
oscillator and dynamical system theory. As the insolation is quite a complex quasiperiodic signal
involving different frequencies, the traditional concepts used to define synchronisation to
periodic forcing are no longer applicable. Instead, we explore a different concept of generalised
synchronisation in terms of (coexisting) synchronised solutions for the forced system, their
basins of attraction and instabilities. We propose a clustering technique to compute the number
of synchronised solutions, each of which corresponds to a different paleoclimate history. In this
way, we uncover multistable synchronisation (reminiscent of phase- or frequency-locking to individual
periodic components of astronomical forcing) at low forcing strength, and monostable or unique
synchronisation at stronger forcing. In the multistable regime, different initial conditions
may lead to different paleoclimate histories. To study their robustness, we analyse Lyapunov exponents
that quantify the rate of convergence towards each synchronised solution (local stability), and
basins of attraction that indicate critical levels of external perturbations (global stability).
We find that even though synchronised solutions are stable on a long term, there exist short episodes
of desynchronisation where nearby climate trajectories diverge temporarily (for about 50 kyr).
