We consider the incompressible homogeneous Navier-Stokes (NS) equations on T^d = (R/2 pi Z)^d,
in the setting of the Sobolev spaces H^n(T^d) of divergence free, zero mean vector fields (n >
d/2+1). Morosi and Pizzocchero [16] treated the approximate solutions of the NS Cauchy problem
having the form u^N(t) = sum_{j=0}^N R^j u_j(t), where R is the "mathematical" Reynolds number (the
reciprocal of the kinematic viscosity) and the coefficients u_j(t) are determined stipulating
that the NS equations be satisfied up to an error O(R^{N+1}). In the cited work it was shown how to obtain
quantitative estimates on the exact solution u of the NS Cauchy problem via a posteriori analysis
of the Reynolds expansion u^N; such estimates concern the interval of existence of u and the Sobolev
distance between u(t) and u^N(t). This framework was exemplified in dimension d=3 with the initial
datum of Behr, Necas and Wu, computing via Mathematica the Reynolds expansion up to the order N=5.
The present work contains results on this subject obtained by a more efficient Python program; this
has allowed us to push the Reynolds expansion up to the order N=20 for the Behr-Necas-Wu (BNW) datum.
We have considered two more (d=3) initial data, namely, the vortices of Taylor-Green (TG) and Kida-Murakami
(KM); the expansions for these data have been built via Python up to the orders N=20 and N=12, respectively.
Our analysis grants, amongst else, that the solution of the NS equations with the three data mentioned
above is global if R is below a critical value. This result can be reformulated in terms of the "physical"
Reynolds number Re := V_{*} L_{*} R, where V_{*} is the initial mean quadratic velocity and L_{*}
is the mean quadratic wavelength of the initial datum. The conclusion is that we have global existence
for the BNW, TG and KM initial data if Re <= 7.84, Re <= 5.07 and Re <= 1.00, respectively.
