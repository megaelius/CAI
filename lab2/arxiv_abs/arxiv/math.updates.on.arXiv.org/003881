With the increasing scale of antenna arrays in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications,
the physical propagation delays of electromagnetic waves traveling across the whole array will
become large and comparable to the time-domain sample period, which is known as the spatial-wideband
effect. In this case, different subcarriers in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) system will "see" distinct angles of arrival (AoAs) for the same path. This effect is known
as beam squint, resulting from the spatial-wideband effect, and makes the approaches based on the
conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model, such as channel estimation and precoding,
inapplicable. After discussing the relationship between beam squint and the spatial-wideband
effect, we propose a channel estimation scheme for frequency-division duplex (FDD) mmWave massive
MIMO-OFDM systems with hybrid analog/digital precoding, which takes the beam squint effect into
consideration. A super-resolution compressed sensing approach is developed to extract the frequency-insensitive
parameters of each uplink channel path, i.e., the AoA and the time delay, and the frequency-sensitive
parameter, i.e., the complex channel gain. With the help of the reciprocity of these frequency-insensitive
parameters in FDD systems, the downlink channel estimation can be greatly simplified, where only
limited pilots are needed to obtain downlink complex gains and reconstruct downlink channels.
Furthermore, the uplink and downlink channel covariance matrices can be constructed from these
frequency-insensitive channel parameters rather than through a long-term average, which enables
the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation to further enhance performance. Numerical
results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the conventional methods in mmWave
communications.
