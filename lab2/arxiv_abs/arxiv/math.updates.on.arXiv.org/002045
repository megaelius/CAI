The well-known Influence Maximization (IM) problem has been actively studied by researchers over
the past decade, with emphasis on marketing and social networks. Existing research have obtained
solutions to the IM problem by obtaining the influence spread and utilizing the property of submodularity.
This paper is based on a novel approach to the IM problem geared towards optimizing clicks and consequently
revenue within anOnline Social Network (OSN). Our approach diverts from existing approaches by
adopting a novel, decision-making perspective through implementing Stochastic Dynamic Programming
(SDP). Thus, we define a new problem Influence Maximization-Revenue Optimization (IM-RO) and
propose SDP as a method in which this problem can be solved. The SDP method has lucrative gains for
an advertiser in terms of optimizing clicks and generating revenue however, one drawback to the
method is its associated "curse of dimensionality" particularly for problems involving a large
state space. Thus, we introduce the Lawrence Degree Heuristic (LDH), Adaptive Hill-Climbing (AHC)
and Multistage Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) heuristics as methods which are orders of magnitude
faster than the SDP method whilst achieving near-optimal results. Through a comparative analysis
on various synthetic and real-world networks we present the AHC and LDH as heuristics well suited
to to the IM-RO problem in terms of their accuracy, running times and scalability under ideal model
parameters. In this paper we present a compelling survey on the SDP method as a practical and lucrative
method for spreading information and optimizing revenue within the context of OSNs.
