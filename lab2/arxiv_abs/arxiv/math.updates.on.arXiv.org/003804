For charged particle transport the linear Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) turns out to be a partial
hyper-singular integro-differential operator. This is due to the fact that the related differential
cross-sections $\sigma(x,\omega',\omega,E',E)$ may have hyper-singularities. In these cases
the energy integral appearing in the collision terms must be interpreted as the Hadamard finite
part integral leading to hyper-singular integral operators. The article considers a refined expression
for the exact transport operator and related variational formulations of the inflow initial boundary
value problem for one particle equation containing hyper-singularities. We find that the exact
BTE contains the first-order partial derivatives with respect to energy combined by partial Hadamard
(first-order) singular integral operators. In addition, it contains the second-order partial
derivatives with respect to angle and some mixed terms. The analysis will be carried out only for
the so called M{\o}ller-type interaction (scattering) which is a kind of prototype of hyper-singular
interactions. The generalizations to other type of collisions, such as to Bremsstrahlung, go analogously.
We also expose a weak form (the variational formulation) of the hyper-singular transport problem.
Another variant variational formulation decreases the level of singularities in the integration
(appearing in the due bilinear form) containing only singularities of order one that is, singularities
like ${1\over{E'-E}}dE' dE$. The variational formulation is an essential step in order to show
the existence of generalized solutions e.g. by Lions-Lax-Milgram Theorem based methods (proceedings
for solution spaces and existence theory are omitted here). The corresponding approximative transport
operator is deduced. It turns out to be a CSDA-Fokker-Planck type operator.
