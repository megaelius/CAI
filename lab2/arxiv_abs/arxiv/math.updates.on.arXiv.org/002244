A hyperbolic transcendental entire function with connected Fatou set is said to be "of disjoint
type". It is known that a disjoint-type function provides a model for the dynamics near infinity
of all maps in the same parameter space; hence a good understanding of these functions has implications
in wider generality. Our goal is to study the topological properties of the Julia sets of entire functions
of disjoint type. In particular, we give a detailed description of the topology of their connected
components. More precisely, consider a "Julia continuum" C of such a function, i.e. the closure
in the Riemann sphere of a component of the Julia set. We show that infinity is a terminal point of C,
and that C has span zero in the sense of Lelek; under a mild geometric assumption on the function C is
arc-like. (Whether every span zero continuum is also arc-like was a famous question in continuum
theory, only recently resolved in the negative.) Conversely, we construct a single disjoint-type
entire function with the remarkable property that each arc-like continuum with at least one terminal
point is realised as a Julia continuum. The class of arc-like continua with terminal points is uncountable.
It includes, in particular, the sin(1/x)-curve, the Knaster buckethandle and the pseudo-arc,
so these can all occur as Julia continua of a disjoint-type entire function. We give similar descriptions
of the possible topology of Julia continua that contain periodic points or points with bounded orbits,
and answer a question of Bara\'nski and Karpi\'nska by showing that Julia continua need not contain
points that are accessible from the Fatou set. Furthermore, we construct an entire function whose
Julia set has connected components on which the iterates tend to infinity pointwise, but not uniformly.
This is related to a famous conjecture of Eremenko concerning escaping sets of entire functions.
