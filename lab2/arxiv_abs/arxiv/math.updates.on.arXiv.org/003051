The competitive exclusion principle states that a number of species competing for a smaller number
of resources cannot coexist. Even though this is a fundamental principle in ecology, it has been
observed empirically that in some settings it will fail. One example is Hutchinson's `paradox of
the plankton'. This is an instance where a large number of phytoplankton species coexist while competing
for a very limited number of resources. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that
in some instances (deterministic) temporal fluctuations of the environment can facilitate coexistence
for competing species. Hutchinson conjectured that one can get coexistence because nonequilibrium
conditions would make it possible for different species to be favored by the environment at different
times. In this paper we look at how environmental noise interacts with competitive exclusion. If
the environmental stochasticity is modeled by white noise, and the per-capita growth rates of the
competitors depend linearly on the resources, we prove that the competitive exclusion principle
has to hold. However, if either the dependence between the growth rates and the resources is not linear
or the white noise term is nonlinear, the competitive exclusion principle can be violated. Maybe
even more surprisingly, if the noise comes from switching the environment at random times between
a finite number of possible states it is possible for all species to coexist even if the growth rates
depend linearly on the resources. Moreover, we show in an example that, contrary to Hutchinson's
explanation, one can switch between two environments in which the same species is favored and still
get coexistence.
