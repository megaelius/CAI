In this paper, a novel framework that enables a predictive deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) as flying base stations (BSs) to complement ground cellular systems in face of steep surges
in wireless traffic is proposed. Considering downlink communications, the goal is to efficiently
offload wireless traffic from congested ground cellular networks to flying UAVs. To provide delay-free
aerial service, first, a novel machine learning (ML) framework, based on wavelet decomposition
and compressive sensing, is proposed to model the cellular traffic pattern. Given the predicted
traffic demand, a contract matching problem is formulated to study the optimal allocation of UAVs
to hotspot areas for traffic offloading. In order to employ a UAV with enough communication capacity
at a reasonable price, a new approach based on contract theory is proposed that enables each BS to
determine the payment charged to each employed UAV based on predicted demand while guaranteeing
that each UAV truthfully reveals its communication capacity. To optimally allocate each UAV to
hotspot areas, a matching approach is applied to jointly maximize the individual utility of each
BS and UAV. The prediction error of the proposed ML framework is analytically derived and the results
show that the proposed approach yields a performance gain of 10% and 13% in overall prediction accuracy,
and 28.3% and 56.6% improvement of the demand prediction during hotspot events, compared with the
support vector machine and the weighted expectation maximization methods, respectively. Simulation
results show that the proposed predictive deployment of UAVs can yield a two-fold improvement on
average per BS utility and a 60% improvement on average per UAV utility, respectively, compared
with a baseline, event-driven allocation of UAVs to ground hotspot areas.
