For a finite involutive non-degenerate solution $(X,r)$ of the Yang--Baxter equation it is known
that the structure monoid $M(X,r)$ is a monoid of I-type, and the structure algebra $K[M(X,r)]$
over a field $K$ shares many properties with commutative polynomial algebras, in particular, it
is a Noetherian PI-domain that has finite Gelfand--Kirillov dimension. In this paper we deal with
arbitrary finite (left) non-degenerate solutions. Although the structure of both the monoid $M(X,r)$
and the algebra $K[M(X,r)]$ is much more complicated than in the involutive case, we provide some
deep insights. In this general context, using a realization of Lebed and Vendramin of $M(X,r)$ as
a regular submonoid in the semidirect product $A(X,r)\rtimes\mathrm{Sym}(X)$, where $A(X,r)$
is the structure monoid of the rack solution associated to $(X,r)$, we prove that $K[M(X,r)]$ is
a finite module over a central affine subalgebra. In particular, $K[M(X,r)]$ is a Noetherian PI-algebra
of finite Gelfand--Kirillov dimension bounded by $|X|$. We also characterize, in ring-theoretical
terms of $K[M(X,r)]$, when $(X,r)$ is an involutive solution. This characterization provides,
in particular, a positive answer to the Gateva-Ivanova conjecture concerning cancellativity
of $M(X,r)$. These results allow us to control the prime spectrum of the algebra $K[M(X,r)]$ and
to describe the Jacobson radical and prime radical of $K[M(X,r)]$. Finally, we give a matrix-type
representation of the algebra $K[M(X,r)]/P$ for each prime ideal $P$ of $K[M(X,r)]$. As a consequence,
we show that if $K[M(X,r)]$ is semiprime then there exist finitely many finitely generated abelian-by-finite
groups, $G_1,\dotsc,G_m$, each being the group of quotients of a cancellative subsemigroup of
$M(X,r)$ such that the algebra $K[M(X,r)]$ embeds into $\mathrm{M}_{v_1}(K[G_1])\times\dotsb\times
\mathrm{M}_{v_m}(K[G_m])$.
