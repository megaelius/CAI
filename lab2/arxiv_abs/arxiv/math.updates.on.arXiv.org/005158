Dominating set problems are among the most important class of combinatorial problems in graph optimization,
from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of view. In this paper, we address the recently
introduced (minimum) weighted total domination problem. In this problem, we are given an undirected
graph with a vertex weight function and an edge weight function. The goal is to find a total dominating
set D in this graph with minimal weight. A total dominating set D is a subset of the vertices such that
every vertex in the graph, including vertices in D, is adjacent to a vertex in D. The weight is measured
as the sum of all vertex weights of vertices in D, plus the edge weights in the subgraph induced by D,
plus for each vertex not in D the minimum weight of an edge from it to a vertex in D. In this paper, we present
two new Mixed-Integer Programming models for the problem, and design solution frameworks based
on them. These solution frameworks also include valid inequalities, starting heuristics and primal
heuristics. In addition, we also develop a genetic algorithm, which is based on a greedy randomized
adaptive search procedure version of our starting heuristic. We carry out a computational study
to assess the performance of our approaches when compared to the previous work for the same problem.
The study reveals that our exact solution algorithms are up to 500 times faster compared to previous
exact approaches and instances with up to 125 vertices can be solved to optimality within a timelimit
of 1800 seconds. Moreover, the presented genetic algorithm also works well and often finds the optimal
or a near-optimal solution within a short runtime. Additionally, we also analyze the influence
of instance-characteristics on the performance of our algorithms.
