In this paper, the problem of joint power and resource allocation for ultra-reliable low latency
communication (URLLC) in vehicular networks is studied. The key goal is to minimize the network-wide
power consumption of vehicular users (VUEs) subject to high reliability in terms of probabilistic
queuing delays. In particular, using extreme value theory (EVT), a new reliability measure is defined
to characterize extreme events pertaining to vehicles' queue lengths exceeding a predefined threshold
with non-negligible probability. In order to learn these extreme events in a dynamic vehicular
network, a novel distributed approach based on federated learning (FL) is proposed to estimate
the tail distribution of the queues. Taking into account the communication delays incurred by FL
over wireless links, Lyapunov optimization is used to derive the joint transmit power and resource
allocation policies enabling URLLC for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed solution
is then validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. Simulation results
show that FL enables the proposed distributed method to estimate the tail distribution of queues
with an accuracy that is very close to a centralized solution with up to 79% reductions in the amount
of data that need to be exchanged. Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60% reductions of
VUEs with large queue lengths, while reducing the average power consumption by two folds, compared
to an average queue-based baseline. For the VUEs with large queue lengths, the proposed method reduces
their average queue lengths and fluctuations therein by about 30% compared to the aforementioned
baseline.
