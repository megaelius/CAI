Self-similar curves arise naturally as the tension-free equilibrium states of conformally invariant
bending energies. The simplest example is the M\"obius invariant conformal arc-length on planar
curves, dependent on the Frenet curvature $\kappa$ through its first derivative with respect to
arc-length. There are four conserved currents associated with this invariance: the tension and
torque associated with Euclidean invariance, as well as scalar and vector currents reflecting
invariance under scaling and special conformal transformations respectively. If the tension
vanishes, all equilibrium states are self-similar: in the case of conformal arc-length, these
are logarithmic spirals with no internal structure. More generally, the tension-free states are
logarithmic spirals decorated with a repeating self-similar internal structure. Here it will
be shown how the conservation laws can be used to construct these curves, while also endowing their
geometry with a mechanical interpretation. The scaling current and the torque together provide
a scale-invariant ode for the dimensionless variable $\kappa'/\kappa^2$, which captures the
internal structure of the spiral. For conformal arc-length it is constant. In tension-free states,
the special conformal current vanishes. Its projections along orthogonal directions determine
directly the distance from the spiral apex locally in terms of the curvature. The quadratic Casimir
invariant of the M\"obius group can be cast in terms of the four currents, none of which itself is invariant.
For conformal arc-length, this is identified as the conformal curvature (the Schwarzian derivative
of the Frenet curvature); it is constant along equilibrium curves.
