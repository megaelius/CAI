We study the density of the set $\operatorname{SNA}(M,Y)$ of those Lipschitz maps from a (complete
pointed) metric space $M$ to a Banach space $Y$ which strongly attain their norm (i.e.\ the supremum
defining the Lipschitz norm is actually a maximum). We present new and somehow counterintuitive
examples, and we give some applications. First, we show that $\operatorname{SNA}(\mathbb T,Y)$
is not dense in ${\mathrm{Lip}}_0(\mathbb T,Y)$ for any Banach space $Y$, where $\mathbb T$ denotes
the unit circle in the Euclidean plane. This provides the first example of a Gromov concave metric
space (i.e.\ every molecule is a strongly exposed point of the unit ball of the Lipschitz-free space)
for which the density does not hold. Next, we construct metric spaces $M$ satisfying that $\operatorname{SNA}(M,Y)$
is dense in ${\mathrm{Lip}}_0(M,Y)$ regardless $Y$ but which contains an isometric copy of $[0,1]$
and so the Lipschitz-free space $\mathcal F(M)$ fails the Radon--Nikod\'{y}m property, answering
in the negative a posed question. Furthermore, an example $M$ can be produced failing all the previously
known sufficient conditions to get the density of strongly norm attaining Lipschitz maps. Finally,
among other applications, we prove that given a compact metric $M$ which does not contains any isometric
copy of $[0,1]$ and a Banach space $Y$, if $\operatorname{SNA}(M,Y)$ is dense, then $\operatorname{SNA}(M,Y)$
actually contains an open dense subset and $B_{\mathcal F(M)}=\overline{{\mathrm{co}}}(\operatorname{str-exp}(B_{\mathcal
F(M)}))$. Further, we show that if $M$ is a boundedly compact metric space for which $\operatorname{SNA}(M,\mathbb
R)$ is dense in ${\mathrm{Lip}}_0(M,\mathbb R)$, then the unit ball of the Lipschitz-free space
on $M$ is the closed convex hull of its strongly exposed points.
