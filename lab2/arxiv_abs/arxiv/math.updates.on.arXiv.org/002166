One of the most important results in operator theory is And\^o's \cite{ando} generalization of
dilation theory for a single contraction to a pair of commuting contractions acting on a Hilbert
space. While there are two explicit constructions (Sch\"affer \cite{sfr} and Douglas \cite{Doug-Dilation})
of the minimal isometric dilation of a single contraction, there was no such explicit construction
of an And\^o dilation for a commuting pair $(T_1,T_2)$ of contractions, except in some special cases
\cite{A-M-Dist-Var, D-S, D-S-S}. In this paper, we give two new proofs of And\^o's dilation theorem
by giving both Sch\"affer-type and Douglas-type explicit constructions of an And\^o dilation
with function-theoretic interpretation, for the general case. The results, in particular, give
a complete description of all possible factorizations of a given contraction $T$ into the product
of two commuting contractions. Unlike the one-variable case, two minimal And\^o dilations need
not be unitarily equivalent. However, we show that the compressions of the two And\^o dilations
constructed in this paper to the minimal dilation spaces of the contraction $T_1T_2$, are unitarily
equivalent. In the special case when the product $T=T_1T_2$ is pure, i.e., if $T^{* n}\to 0$ strongly,
an And\^o dilation was constructed recently in \cite{D-S-S}, which, as this paper will show, is
a corollary to the Douglas-type construction. We define a notion of characteristic triple for a
pair of commuting contractions and a notion of coincidence for such triples. We prove that two pairs
of commuting contractions with their products being pure contractions are unitarily equivalent
if and only if their characteristic triples coincide. We also characterize triples which qualify
as the characteristic triple for some pair $(T_1,T_2)$ of commuting contractions such that $T_1T_2$
is a pure contraction.
