A function $f\in \BUC(\R^d)$ is said to be weakly* almost periodic, denoted $f\in\APs(\R^d)$,
if there is $g\in\AP(\R^d)$, such that, $\oM(|f-g|)=0$, where $\BUC(\R^d)$ and $\AP(\R^d)$ are,
respectively, the space of bounded uniformly continuous functions and the space of almost periodic
functions, in $\R^d$, and $\oM(h)$ denotes the mean value of $h$, if it exists. We give a very simple
direct proof of the stochastic homogenization property of the Dirichlet problem for fully nonlinear
uniformly elliptic equations of the form $F(\om,\frac{x}{\ve},D^2u)=0$, $x\in U$, in a bounded
domain $U\subset\R^d$, in the case where for almost all $\om\in \Om$, the realization $F(\om,\cdot,M)$
is a weakly* almost periodic function, for all $M\in\S^d$, where $\S^d$ is the space of $d\X d$ symmetric
matrices. Here $(\Om,\mu,\FF)$ is a probability space with probability measure $\mu$ and $\s$-algebra
$\FF$ of $\mu$-measurable subsets of $\Om$. For each fixed $M\in\S^d$, $F(\om,y,M)$ is a stationary
process, that is, $F(\om,y,M)=\tilde F(T(y)\om,M):= F(T(y)\om,0,M)$, where $T(y):\Om\to\Om$
is an ergodic group of measure preserving mappings such that the mapping $(\om,y)\to T(y)\om$ is
measurable. Also, $F(\om,y,M)$, $M\in\S^d$, is uniformly elliptic, with ellipticity constants
$0<\l<\gL$ independent of $(\om,y)\in\Om\X\R^d$. The result presented here is a particular
instance of the general theorem of Caffarelli, Souganidis and Wang, in CPAM 2005. Our point here
is just to show a straightforward proof for this special case, which serves as a motivation for that
general theorem, whose proof involves much more intricate arguments. We remark that any continuous
stationary process verifies the property that almost all realizations belong to an ergodic algebra,
and that $\APs(\R^d)$ is, so far, the greatest known ergodic algebra on $\R^d$.
