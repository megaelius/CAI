The OFDM waveform exhibits high fluctuation in the signal envelope, which causes the nonlinear
power amplifier of the transmitter to produce distortion. Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR)
and Cubic Metric (CM) are the most commonly used metrics to quantify the phenomenon. Originally
proposed in the literature for PAPR reduction, the Sign Selection problem is an approach for minimizing
the metric of interest by altering the signs of the data symbols, which implies an exponential complexity.
In this paper, the Method of Conditional Expectations (CE Method) is proposed to obtain a competing
suboptimal solution to the Sign Selection problem. For PAPR reduction, a surrogate metric is introduced
which allows for a more efficient application of the CE Method compared to a direct application to
the PAPR metric itself without considerable performance degradation. For CM reduction, the tractability
of the definition of CM is exploited to efficiently apply the CE Method. The reduction performance
is analyzed to obtain a constant upper bound on the reduced metric value for every realization of
the data symbols. Simulations show a persistent reduction of the effective PAPR - the value at which
the distribution function of PAPR equals 0.999 - to about 6.5dB for a wide range of 64 to 1024 subcarriers.
The steady performance is observed for CM reduction as well with a reduction of roughly 3dB. A pruned
version of the sign selection approach is made possible by the CE Method, such that it reduces the
rate loss from $\log_2 M$ to $\frac{1}{2} \log_2 M$ bits per symbol for $M$-ary modulation order
with insignificant loss in performance
