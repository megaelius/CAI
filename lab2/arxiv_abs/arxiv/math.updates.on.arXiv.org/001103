In this paper we derive weak limits for the discretization errors of sampling barrier-hitting and
extreme events of Brownian motion by using the Euler discretization simulation method. Specifically,
we consider the Euler discretization approximation of Brownian motion to sample barrier-hitting
events, i.e. hitting for the first time a deterministic "barrier" function; and to sample extreme
events, i.e. attaining a minimum on a given compact time interval or unbounded closed time interval.
For each case we study the discretization error between the actual time the event occurs versus the
time the event occurs for the discretized path, and also the discretization error on the position
of the Brownian motion at these times. We show limits in distribution for the discretization errors
normalized by their convergence rate, and give closed-form analytic expressions for the limiting
random variables. Additionally, we use these limits to study the asymptotic behaviour of Gaussian
random walks in the following situations: (1.) the overshoot of a Gaussian walk above a barrier that
goes to infinity; (2.) the minimum of a Gaussian walk compared to the minimum of the Brownian motion
obtained when interpolating the Gaussian walk with Brownian bridges, both up to the same time horizon
that goes to infinity; and (3.) the global minimum of a Gaussian walk compared to the global minimum
of the Brownian motion obtained when interpolating the Gaussian walk with Brownian bridges, when
both have the same positive drift decreasing to zero. In deriving these limits in distribution we
provide a unified framework to understand the relation between several papers where the constant
$-\zeta(1/2)/\sqrt{2 \pi}$ has appeared, where $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function. In particular,
we show that this constant is the mean of some of the limiting distributions we derive.
