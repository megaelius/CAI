Species' densities experience both internal frequency-dependent feedbacks due to population
structure and external feedbacks from abiotic factors. These feedbacks can determine whether
populations persist or go extinct, and may be subject to stochastic fluctuations. To provide a general
mathematical framework for studying these effects, we develop theorems for stochastic persistence
and exclusion for stochastic ecological difference equations accounting for feedbacks. Specifically,
we use the stochastic analog of average Lyapunov functions to develop sufficient and necessary
conditions for (i) all population densities spending little time at low densities i.e. stochastic
persistence, and (ii) population trajectories asymptotically approaching the extinction set
with positive probability. For (i) and (ii), respectively, we provide quantitative estimates
on the fraction of time that the system is near the extinction set, and the probability of asymptotic
extinction as a function of the initial state of the system. Furthermore, in the case of persistence,
we provide lower bounds for the time to escape neighborhoods of the extinction set. To illustrate
the applicability of our results, we analyze models of evolutionary games, stochastic Lotka-Volterra
difference equations, trait evolution, and spatially structured disease dynamics. Our analysis
of these models demonstrates environmental stochasticity facilitates coexistence in the hawk-dove
game, but inhibits coexistence in the rock-paper-scissors game and Lotka-Volterra predator-prey
model. Furthermore, environmental fluctuations with positive auto-correlations can promote
persistence of evolving populations and disease persistence in patchy landscapes. While these
results help close the gap between persistence theories for deterministic and stochastic systems,
we conclude by highlighting several challenges for future research.
