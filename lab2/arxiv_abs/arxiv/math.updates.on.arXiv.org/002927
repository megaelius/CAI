This work studies a beamforming design for downlink transmission of a multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MISO) system where each legitimate user employs a power splitting (PS) based simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique. The transmitter intends to send confidential
information to its legitimate users in the presence of purely unknown eavesdroppers. Since the
transmitter does not have any knowledge of the eavesdroppers' channel state information (CSI),
we consider an artificial noise (AN) approach to establishing secure communication. This beamforming
design is developed by maximizing the AN power to interfere with the eavesdropper as much as possible.
Based on the assumption of imperfect CSI of legitimate users at the transmitter, two robust design
approaches for the joint beamforming and PS ratio have been studied to maximize the AN power under
both energy harvesting (EH) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements
at each legitimate user. In the first robust design, we consider the bounded channel uncertainties,
and employ semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and a linear matrix inequality (LMI) representation
to transform the original problem into a semidefinite program (SDP). In the second robust design,
we consider the statistical channel uncertainties, and show that the proposed problem can be reformulated
into another form of SDP through both SDR and Bernstein-type inequality. In addition, the non-linear
energy harvesting (EH) model is incorporated in this work as it could reflect the characteristics
of practical radio frequency(RF)-EH conversion circuit. Simulation results have been provided
to demonstrate the performance of our proposed robust designs.
