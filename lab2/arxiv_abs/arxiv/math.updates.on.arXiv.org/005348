The modeling of atmospheric processes in the context of weather and climate simulations is an important
and computationally expensive challenge. The temporal integration of the underlying PDEs requires
a very large number of time steps, even when the terms accounting for the propagation of fast atmospheric
waves are treated implicitly. Therefore, the use of parallel-in-time integration schemes to reduce
the time-to-solution is of increasing interest, particularly in the numerical weather forecasting
field. We propose a multi-level parallel-in-time integration method combining the Parallel Full
Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) with a spatial discretization based on Spherical
Harmonics (SH). This iterative algorithm computes multiple time steps concurrently by interweaving
parallel high-order fine corrections and serial corrections performed on a coarsened problem
to propagate the updated initial conditions between time steps. We design a methodology that relies
on the spectral basis of the SH to coarsen and interpolate the problem in space. The methods are evaluated
on the shallow-water equations on the sphere using a set of tests commonly used in the atmospheric
flow community. We assess the convergence of PFASST-SH upon refinement in time. We also investigate
the impact of the coarsening strategy on the accuracy of the scheme, and specifically on its ability
to capture the high-frequency modes accumulating in the solution. Finally, we study the computational
cost of PFASST-SH to demonstrate that our scheme resolves the main features of the solution multiple
times faster than the serial schemes and to illustrate the scalability of the approach.
