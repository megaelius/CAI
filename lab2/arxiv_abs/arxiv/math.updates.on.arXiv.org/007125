Let $Hilb ^{p(t)}(P^n)$ be the Hilbert scheme of closed subschemes of $P^n$ with Hilbert polynomial
$p(t) \in Q[t]$, and let $W:= \overline{W(\underline{b};\underline{a};r)}$ be the closure of
the locus in $Hilb ^{p(t)}(P^n)$ of determinantal schemes defined by the vanishing of the $(t-r+1)\times
(t - r+1)$ minors of some matrix $\mathcal A$ of size $t\times (t+c-1)$ with $ij$-enty a homogeneous
form of degree $a_j-b_i$ and with $r$ satisfying $\max\{1,2-c\} \le r < t$. $W$ is an irreducible
algebraic set. First of all, we compute an upper $r$-independent bound for the dimension of $W$ in
terms of $a_j$ and $b_i$ which is sharp for $r=1$. In the linear case ($a_j = 1, b_i=0$) and cases sufficiently
close, we conjecture and to a certain degree prove that this bound is achieved for all $r$. Then, we
study to what extent $W$ is a generically smooth component of $Hilb ^{p(t)}(P^n)$. Under some weak
numerical assumptions on the integers $a_j$ and $b_i$ (or under some depth conditions) we conjecture
and often prove that $W$ is a generically smooth component. Moreover, we also study the depth of the
normal module of the homogeneous coordinate ring of $(X)\in W$ and of a closely related module. We
conjecture, and in some cases prove, that their codepth is often 1 (resp. $r$). These results extend
previous results on standard determinantal schemes to determinantal schemes; i.e. previous results
of the authors on $W(\underline{b};\underline{a};1)$ to $W$ with $1\le r < t$ and $c\ge 2-r$. Finally,
deformations of exterior powers of the cokernel of the map determined by $\mathcal A$ are studied
and proven to be given as deformations of $X \subset P^n$ if $\dim X \ge 3$. The work contains many examples
which illustrate the results obtained and a considerable number of open problems; some of them are
collected as conjectures in the final section.
