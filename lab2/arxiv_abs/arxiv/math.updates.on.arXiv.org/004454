We deal with the following general version of the classical moment problem: when can a linear functional
on a unital commutative real algebra $A$ be represented as an integral w.r.t. a Radon measure on the
character space $X(A)$ of $A$ equipped with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by the weak topology
$\tau_A$? We approach this problem by constructing $X(A)$ as a projective limit of a certain family
of Borel measurable spaces and so by considering on $X(A)$ two natural measurable structures: the
associated cylinder $\sigma$-algebra and the Borel $\sigma$--algebra generated by the corresponding
projective topology which coincides with $\tau_A$. This allows us to obtain representations of
linear functionals fulfilling certain positivity properties as integrals w.r.t. measures defined
on the cylinder $\sigma$-algebra on $X(A)$. Combining these results with the well-known Prokhorov
theorem, we get extensions of such measures to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra. We exploit this to derive
results for infinitely (even uncountably) generated algebras by means of classical theorems for
finitely generated algebras, as for example Riesz-Haviland's theorem and Nussbaum's theorem.
Using our projective limit technique, we also investigate the problem of localizing the support
of the representing measure and obtain a representation theorem for linear functionals nonnegative
on a partially Archimedean quadratic module of $A$. Our results apply in particular to the case when
$A$ is the polynomial algebra in an arbitrary number of variables or the symmetric tensor algebra
$S(V)$ of a real vector space $V$ of arbitrary dimension, providing alternative proofs (and in some
cases stronger versions) of some recent results for these instances of the moment problem and offering
at the same time a unified setting which enables comparisons.
