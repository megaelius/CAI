In this paper, we give a method for relating the generalized category $\mathcal{O}$ defined by the
author and collaborators to explicit finitely presented algebras, and apply this to quiver varieties.
This allows us to describe combinatorially not just the structure of these category $\mathcal{O}$'s
but also how certain interesting families of derived equivalences, the shuffling and twisting
functors, act on them. In the case of Nakajima quiver varieties, the algebras that appear are weighted
KLR algebras and their steadied quotients, defined by the author in earlier work. In particular,
these give a geometric construction of canonical bases for simple representations, tensor products
and Fock spaces. If the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action used to define the category $\mathcal{O}$ is a "tensor
product action" in the sense of Nakajima, then we arrive at the unique categorifications of tensor
products; in particular, we obtain a geometric description of the braid group actions used by the
author in defining categorifications of Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. Similarly, in affine
type A, an arbitrary action results in the diagrammatic algebra equivalent to blocks of category
$\mathcal{O}$ for cyclotomic Cherednik algebras. This approach also allows us to show that these
categories are Koszul and understand their Koszul duals; in particular, we can show that categorifications
of minuscule tensor products in types ADE are Koszul. In the affine case, this shows that our category
$\mathcal{O}$'s are Koszul and their Koszul duals are given by category $\mathcal{O}$'s with rank-level
dual dimension data, and that this duality switches shuffling and twisting functors.
