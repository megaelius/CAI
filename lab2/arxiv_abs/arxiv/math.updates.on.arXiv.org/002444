Efficient high-order time integration schemes are necessary to capture the complex processes
involved in atmospheric flows over long periods of time. In this work, we propose a high-order, implicit-explicit
numerical scheme that combines Multi-Level Spectral Deferred Corrections (MLSDC) and the Spherical
Harmonics (SH) transform to solve the wave-propagation problems arising from the shallow-water
equations on the rotating sphere. The iterative temporal integration is based on a sequence of corrections
distributed on coupled space-time levels to perform a significant portion of the calculations
on a coarse representation of the problem and hence to reduce the time-to-solution while preserving
accuracy. In our scheme, referred to as MLSDC-SH, the spatial discretization plays a key role in
the efficiency of MLSDC, since the SH basis allows for consistent transfer functions between space-time
levels that preserve important physical properties of the solution. We study the performance of
the MLSDC-SH scheme with shallow-water test cases commonly used in numerical atmospheric modeling.
We use this suite of test cases, which gradually adds more complexity to the nonlinear system of governing
partial differential equations, to perform a detailed analysis of the convergence rate of MLSDC-SH
upon refinement in time. We illustrate the good stability properties of MLSDC-SH and show that the
proposed scheme achieves up to eighth-order accuracy in time. Finally, we study the conditions
in which MLSDC-SH achieves its theoretical speedup, and we show that it can significantly reduce
the computational cost compared to single-level Spectral Deferred Corrections (SDC).
