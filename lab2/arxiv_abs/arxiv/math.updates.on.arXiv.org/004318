We construct and analyze a continuum dynamical percolation process which evolves in a random environment
given by a $\gamma$-Liouville measure. The homogeneous counterpart of this process describes
the scaling limit of discrete dynamical percolation on the rescaled triangular lattice. Our focus
here is to study the same limiting dynamics, but where the speed of microscopic updates is highly
inhomogeneous in space and is driven by the $\gamma$-Liouville measure associated with a two-dimensional
log-correlated field $h$. Roughly speaking, this continuum percolation process evolves very
rapidly where the field $h$ is high and barely moves where the field $h$ is low. Our main results can
be summarized as follows. 1. First, we build this inhomogeneous dynamical percolation which we
call $\gamma$-Liouville dynamical percolation (LDP) by taking the scaling limit of the associated
process on the triangular lattice. We work with three different regimes each requiring different
tools: $\gamma\in [0,2-\sqrt{5/2})$, $\gamma\in [2-\sqrt{5/2}, \sqrt{3/2})$, and $\gamma\in(\sqrt{3/2},2)$.
2. When $\gamma<\sqrt{3/2}$, we prove that $\gamma$-LDP is mixing in the Schramm-Smirnov space
as $t\to \infty$, quenched in the log-correlated field $h$. On the contrary, when $\gamma>\sqrt{3/2}$
the process is frozen in time. The ergodicity result is a crucial piece of the Cardy embedding project
of the second and fourth coauthors, where LDP for $\gamma=\sqrt{1/6}$ is used to study the scaling
limit of a variant of dynamical percolation on uniform triangulations. 3. When $\gamma<\sqrt{3/4}$,
we obtain quantitative bounds on the mixing of quad crossing events.
