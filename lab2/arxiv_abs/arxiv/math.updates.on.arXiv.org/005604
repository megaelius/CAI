We introduce multi-type Markov Branching trees, which are simple random population tree models
where individuals are characterized by their size and type and give rise to (size,type)-children
in a Galton-Watson fashion, with the rule that the size of any individual is a least the sum of the sizes
of its children. Assuming that macroscopic size-splittings are rare, we describe the scaling limits
of multi-type Markov Branching trees in terms of multi-type self-similar fragmentation trees.
We observe three different regimes according to whether the probability of type change of a size-biased
child is proportional to the probability of macroscopic splitting (the critical regime, in which
we get in the limit multi-type fragmentation trees with indeed several types), smaller than the
probability of macroscopic splitting (the solo regime, in which the limit trees are monotype as
we never see a type change), or larger than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the mixing
regime, in which the types mix and we get monotype fragmentation trees). This framework allows us
to unify models which may a priori seem quite different, a strength which we illustrate with two notable
applications. The first one concerns the description of the scaling limits of growing models of
random trees that extend R\'emy's well-known algorithm for the generation of uniform binary trees
to a fairly broad framework. We are then either in the critical or in the solo regimes. The second application
concerns the scaling limits of large multi-type critical Galton-Watson trees when the offspring
distributions all have finite second moments. This topic has already been studied but our approach
gives a different proof and we improve on previous results by relaxing some hypotheses. We are then
in the mixing regime: the scaling limits are multiple of the Brownian CRT, a pure monotype fragmentation
tree in our framework.
