Optimal control of harvested population at the edge of extinction in an unprotected area, is considered.
The underlying population dynamics is governed by a Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation
with a harvesting term and space-dependent coefficients while the control consists of transporting
individuals from a natural reserve. The nonlinear optimal control problem is approximated by means
of a Galerkin scheme. Convergence result about the optimal controlled solutions and error estimates
between the corresponding optimal controls, are derived. For certain parameter regimes, nearly
optimal solutions are calculated from a simple logistic ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with a harvesting term, obtained as a Galerkin approximation of the original partial differential
equation (PDE) model. A critical allowable fraction $\underline{\alpha}$ of the reserve's population
is inferred from the reduced logistic ODE with a harvesting term. This estimate obtained from the
reduced model allows us to distinguish sharply between survival and extinction for the full PDE
itself, and thus to declare whether a control strategy leads to success or failure for the corresponding
rescue operation while ensuring survival in the reserve's population. In dynamical terms, this
result illustrates that although continuous dependence on the forcing may hold on finite-time
intervals, a high sensitivity in the system's response may occur in the asymptotic time. We believe
that this work, by its generality, establishes bridges interesting to explore between optimal
control problems of ODEs with a harvesting term and their PDE counterpart.
