The purpose of this article is to establish bounds from below for the life span of regular solutions
to the incompressible Navier-Stokes system, which involve norms not only of the initial data, but
also of nonlinear functions of the initial data. We provide examples showing that those bounds are
significant improvements to the one provided by the classical fixed point argument. One of the important
ingredients is the use of a scale-invariant energy estimate. 1. Introdution In this article our
aim is to give bounds from below for the life span of solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes
system in the whole space R 3. We are not interested here in the regularity of the initial data: we focus
on obtaining bounds from below for the life span associated with regular initial data. Here regular
means that the initial data belongs to the intersection of all Sobolev spaces of non negative index.
Thus all the solutions we consider are regular ones, as long as they exist. Let us recall the incompressible
Navier-Stokes system, together with some of its basic features. The incompressible Navier-Stokes
system is the following: (N S) $\partial$ t u -- $\Delta$u + u $\times$ $\nabla$u = --$\nabla$p div
u = 0 and u |t=0 = u 0 , where u is a three dimensional, time dependent vector field and p is the pressure,
determined by the incompressibility condition div u = 0: --$\Delta$p = div(u $\times$ $\nabla$u)
= 1$\le$i,j$\le$3 $\partial$ i $\partial$ j (u i u j). This system has two fundamental properties
related to its physical origin: $\bullet$ scaling invariance $\bullet$ dissipation of kinetic
energy. The scaling property is the fact that if a function u satisfies (N S) on a time interval [0,
T ] with the initial data u 0 , then the function u $\lambda$ defined by u $\lambda$ (t, x) def = $\lambda$u($\lambda$
2 t, $\lambda$x) satisfies (N S) on the time interval [0, $\lambda$ --2 T ] with the initial data $\lambda$u
0 ($\lambda$ $\times$). This property is far from being a characteristic property of the system
(N S). It is indeed satisfied by all systems of the form (GN S) $\partial$ t u -- $\Delta$u + Q(u, u) =
0 u |t=0 = u 0 with Q i (u, u) def = 1$\le$j,k$\le$3 A i j,k (D)(u j u k) where the A i j,k (D) are smooth homogenenous
Fourier multipliers of order 1. Indeed denoting by P the projection onto divergence free vector
