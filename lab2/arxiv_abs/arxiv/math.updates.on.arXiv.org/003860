We undertake a systematic study of the notion of fibration in the setting of abstract simplicial
complexes, where the concept of `homotopy' has been replaced by that of `contiguity'. Then a fibration
will be a simplicial map satisfying the `contiguity lifting property'. This definition turns out
to be equivalent to a known notion introduced by G. Minian, established in terms of a cylinder construction
$K \times I_m$. This allows us to prove several properties of simplicial fibrations which are analogous
to the classical ones in the topological setting, for instance: all the fibers of a fibration have
the same strong homotopy type, a notion that has been recently introduced by Barmak and Minian; any
fibration with a strongly collapsible base is fibrewise trivial; and some other ones. We introduce
the concept of `simplicial finite-fibration', that is, a map which has the contiguity lifting property
only for finite complexes. Then, we prove that the path fibration $PK \to K\times K$ is a finite-fibration,
where PK is the space of Moore paths introduced by M. Grandis. This important result allows us to prove
that any simplicial map factors through a finite-fibration, up to a P-homotopy equivalence. Moreover,
we introduce a definition of `\v{S}varc genus' of a simplicial map and, and using the properties
stated before, we are able to compare the \v{S}varc genus of path fibrations with the notions of simplicial
LS-category and simplicial topological complexity introduced by the authors in several previous
papers. Finally, another key result is a simplicial version of a Varadarajan result for fibrations,
relating the LS-category of the total space, the base and the generic fiber.
