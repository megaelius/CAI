Let $W_{\infty}(\beta)$ be the limit of the Biggins martingale $W_n(\beta)$ associated to a supercritical
branching random walk with mean number of offspring $m$. We prove a functional central limit theorem
stating that as $n\to\infty$ the process $$ D_n(u):= m^{\frac 12 n} \left(W_{\infty}\left(\frac{u}{\sqrt
n}\right) - W_{n}\left(\frac{u}{\sqrt n}\right) \right) $$ converges weakly, on a suitable space
of analytic functions, to a Gaussian random analytic function with random variance. Using this
result we prove central limit theorems for the total path length of random trees. In the setting of
binary search trees, we recover a recent result of R. Neininger [Refined Quicksort Asymptotics,
Rand. Struct. and Alg., to appear], but we also prove similar results for uniform random recursive
trees and, more generally, linear recursive trees. Moreover, we replace weak convergence in Neininger's
theorem by the almost sure weak (a.s.w.) convergence of probability transition kernels. In the
case of binary search trees, our result states that $$ \mathcal{L}\left\{\sqrt{\frac{n}{2\log
n}} \left(EPL_{\infty} - \frac{EPL_n-2n\log n}{n}\right)\Bigg | \mathcal{G}_{n}\right\}
\to \{\omega\mapsto N_{0,1}\} \quad a.s.w.,$$ where $EPL_n$ is the external path length of a binary
search tree $X_n$ with $n$ vertices, $EPL_{\infty}$ is the limit of the R\'egnier martingale, and
$\mathcal{L}(\cdot |\mathcal{G}_n)$ denotes the conditional distribution w.r.t. the $\sigma$-algebra
$\mathcal{G}_n$ generated by $X_1,\ldots,X_n$. A.s.w. convergence is stronger than weak and
even stable convergence, and contains a.s. and weak convergence as special cases. We prove several
basic properties of the a.s.w. convergence. We study a number of further examples in which the a.s.w.
convergence appears naturally. These include the classical central limit theorem for Galton--Watson
processes and the P\'olya urn.
