We derive the conditions under which the fluid models obtained from the first two moments of Hamiltonian
drift-kinetic systems of interest to plasma physics, preserve a Hamiltonian structure. The adopted
procedure consists of determining closure relations that allow to truncate the Poisson bracket
of the drift-kinetic system, expressed in terms of the moments, in such a way that the resulting operation
is a Poisson bracket for functionals of the first two fluid moments. The analysis is carried out for
a class of full drift-kinetic equations and also for drift-kinetic systems in which a splitting
between an equilibrium distribution function and a perturbation is performed. In the former case
we obtain that the only closure, not involving integral or differential operators, that leads to
a Poisson bracket, corresponds to that of an ideal adiabatic gas made of molecules possessing one
degree of freedom. In the latter case, Hamiltonian closures turn out to be those in which the second
moment is a linear combination of the first two moments, which can be seen as a linearization of the
Hamiltonian closure of the full drift-kinetic case. A number of weakly-3D Hamiltonian reduced
fluid models of interest, for instance for tokamak plasmas, can be derived in this way and, viceversa
given a fluid model with a Hamiltonian structure of a certain type, a parent Hamiltonian drift-kinetic
model can then be identified. We make use of this correspondence to identify the drift-kinetic models
from which Hamiltonian fluid models for magnetic reconnection and compressible plasma dynamics
in the presence of a static but inhomogeneous magnetic field can be derived. The Casimir invariants
of the Poisson brackets of the derived fluid models are also discussed.
