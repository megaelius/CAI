In this note we present a formula for the CEGM generalized biadjoint amplitudes for all $k$ and $n$
on what we call the minimal kinematics. We prove that on the minimal kinematics, the scattering equations
on the configuration space of $n$ points on $\mathbb{CP}^{k-1}$ has a unique solution, and that
this solution is in the image of a Veronese embedding. The minimal kinematics is an all $k$ generalization
of the one recently introduced by Early for $k=2$ and uses a choice of cyclic ordering. We conjecture
an explicit formula for $m_n^{(k)}(\mathbb{I},\mathbb{I})$ which we have checked analytically
through $n=10$ for all $k$. The answer is a simple rational function which has only simple poles;
the poles have the combinatorial structure of the circulant graph ${\rm C}_n^{(1,2,\ldots ,k-2)}$.
Generalized biadjoint amplitudes can also be evaluated using the positive tropical Grassmannian
${\rm Tr}^+G(k,n)$ in terms of generalized planar Feynman diagrams. We find perfect agreement
between both definitions for all cases where the latter is known in the literature. In particular,
this gives the first strong consistency check on the $90\,608$ planar arrays for ${\rm Tr}^+G(4,8)$
recently computed by Cachazo, Guevara, Umbert and Zhang. We also introduce another class of special
kinematics called it planar-basis kinematics which generalizes the one introduced by Cachazo,
He and Yuan for $k=2$ and uses the planar basis recently introduced by Early for all $k$. Based on numerical
computations through $n=8$ for all $k$, we conjecture that on the planar-basis kinematics $m_n^{(k)}(\mathbb{I},\mathbb{I})$
evaluates to the multidimensional Catalan numbers, suggesting the possibility of novel combinatorial
interpretations. For $k=2$ these are the standard Catalan numbers.
