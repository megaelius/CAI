In this paper we present a new family of high order accurate Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
one-step ADER-WENO finite volume schemes for the solution of nonlinear systems of conservative
and non-conservative hyperbolic partial differential equations with stiff source terms on moving
tetrahedral meshes in three space dimensions. A WENO reconstruction technique is used to achieve
high order of accuracy in space, while an element-local space-time Discontinuous Galerkin finite
element predictor on moving meshes is used to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization.
Within the space-time predictor the physical element is mapped onto a reference element using an
isoparametric approach, where the space-time basis and test functions are given by the Lagrange
interpolation polynomials passing through a predefined set of space-time nodes. Since our algorithm
is cell-centered, the final mesh motion is computed by using a suitable node solver algorithm. A
rezoning step as well as a flattener strategy are used in some of the test problems to avoid mesh tangling
or excessive element deformations that may occur when the computation involves strong shocks or
shear waves. We apply our new high order unstructured ALE schemes to the 3D Euler equations of compressible
gas dynamics, for which a set of classical numerical test problems has been solved and for which convergence
rates up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time have been obtained. We furthermore consider
the equations of classical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as well as the non-conservative seven-equation
Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows with stiff relaxation source terms.
