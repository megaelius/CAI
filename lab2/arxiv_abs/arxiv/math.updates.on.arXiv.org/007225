The Symmetric Primal-Dual Simplex Pivot Decision Strategy (spdspds) is a novel iterative algorithm
to solve linear programming problems. Here, a simplex pivoting operation is considered simply
as an exchange between a basic (dependent) variable and a non-basic (independent) variable, in
the Tucker's Compact Symmetric Tableau (CST) which is a unique symmetric representation common
to both the primal as well as the dual of a linear programming problem in its standard canonical form.
From this viewpoint, the classical simplex pivoting operation of Dantzig may be considered as a
restricted special case. The infeasibility index associated with a simplex tableau is defined
as the sum of the number of primal variables and the number of dual variables, which are infeasible.
A measure of goodness as a global effectiveness measure of a pivot selection is defined/determined
as/by the decrease in the infeasibility index associated with such a pivot selection. At each iteration
the selection of the simplex pivot element is governed by the anticipated decrease in the infeasibility
index - seeking the best possible decrease in the infeasibility index - from among a wide range of
candidate choices with non-zero values - limited only by considerations of potential numerical
instability. Significant enhancement in computational efficiency can also be achieved by the
utilization of the proposed concept of binding constraints. The algorithm terminates when further
reduction in the infeasibility index is not possible; then the tableau is checked for the terminal
tableau type to facilitate the problem classification - a termination with an infeasibility index
of zero indicates optimum solution. The worst case computational complexity of spdspds is shown
to be $O(L^{1.5})$.
