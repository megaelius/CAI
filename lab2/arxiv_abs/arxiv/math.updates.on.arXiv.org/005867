A topological approach to the study of genetic recombination, based on persistent homology, was
introduced by Chan, Carlsson, and Rabad\'an in 2013. This associates a sequence of signatures called
barcodes to genomic data sampled from an evolutionary history. In this paper, we develop theoretical
foundations for this approach. First, we present a novel formulation of the underlying inference
problem. Specifically, we introduce and study the novelty profile, a simple, stable statistic
of an evolutionary history which not only counts recombination events but also quantifies how recombination
creates genetic diversity. We propose that the (hitherto implicit) goal of the topological approach
to recombination is the estimation of novelty profiles. We then study the problem of obtaining a
lower bound on the novelty profile using barcodes. We focus on a low-recombination regime, where
the evolutionary history can be described by a directed acyclic graph called a galled tree, which
differs from a tree only by isolated topological defects. We show that in this regime, under a complete
sampling assumption, the $1^\mathrm{st}$ barcode yields a lower bound on the novelty profile,
and hence on the number of recombination events. For $i>1$, the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ barcode is empty.
In addition, we use a stability principle to strengthen these results to ones which hold for any subsample
of an arbitrary evolutionary history. To establish these results, we describe the topology of the
Vietoris--Rips filtrations arising from evolutionary histories indexed by galled trees. As a
step towards a probabilistic theory, we also show that for a random history indexed by a fixed galled
tree and satisfying biologically reasonable conditions, the intervals of the $1^{\mathrm{st}}$
barcode are independent random variables. Using simulations, we explore the sensitivity of these
intervals to recombination.
