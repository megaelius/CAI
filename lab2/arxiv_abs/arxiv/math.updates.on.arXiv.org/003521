This paper proposes two novel nonlinear attitude filters evolved directly on the Special Orthogonal
Group SO(3) able to ensure prescribed measures of transient and steady-state performance. The
tracking performance of the normalized Euclidean distance of attitude error is trapped to initially
start within a large set and converge systematically and asymptotically to the origin from almost
any initial condition. The convergence rate is guaranteed to be less than the prescribed value and
the steady-state error does not exceed a predefined small value. The first filter uses a set of vectorial
measurements with the need for attitude reconstruction. The second filter instead uses only a rate
gyroscope measurement and two or more vectorial measurements. These filters provide good attitude
estimates with superior convergence properties and can be applied to measurements obtained from
low cost inertial measurement units (IMUs). Simulation results illustrate the robustness and
effectiveness of the proposed attitude filters with guaranteed performance considering high
level of uncertainty in angular velocity along with body-frame vector measurements. Keywords:
