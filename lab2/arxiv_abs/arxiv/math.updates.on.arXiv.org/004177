In this article, we consider an anisotropic finite-range bond percolation model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
On each horizontal layer $H_i = \{(x,i): x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ we have edges $\langle(x, i),(y, i)\rangle$
for $1 \leq |x - y| \leq N$. There are also vertical edges connecting two nearest neighbor vertices
on distinct layers $\langle(x, i), (x, i+1)\rangle$ for $x, i \in\mathbb{Z}$. On this graph we consider
the following anisotropic independent percolation model: horizontal edges are open with probability
$1/(2N)$, while vertical edges are open with probability $\epsilon$ to be suitably tuned as $N$
grows to infinity. The main result tells that if $\epsilon=\kappa N^{-2/5}$, we see a phase transition
in $\kappa$: positive and finite constants $C_1, C_2$ exist so that there is no percolation if $\kappa
< C_1$ while percolation occurs for $\kappa > C_2$. The question is motivated by a result on the analogous
layered ferromagnetic Ising model at mean field critical temperature [J. Stat. Phys. (2015), 161,
91-123] where the authors showed the existence of multiple Gibbs measures for a fixed value of the
vertical interaction and conjectured a change of behavior in $\kappa$ when the vertical interaction
suitably vanishes as $\kappa\gamma^b$, where $1/\gamma$ is the range of the horizontal interaction.
For the product percolation model we have a value of $b$ that differs from what was conjectured in
that paper. The proof relies on the analysis of the scaling limit of the critical branching random
walk that dominates the growth process restricted to each horizontal layer and a careful analysis
of the true horizontal growth process. This is inspired by works on the long range contact process
[Probab. Th. Rel. Fields (1995), 102, 519-545]. A renormalization scheme is used for the percolative
regime.
