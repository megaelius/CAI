In this paper, we set up theoretical foundations for high-dimensional functional factor models
for the analysis of large panels of functional time series (FTS). We first establish a representation
result stating that if the first $r$ eigenvalues of the covariance operator of the cross-section
of $N$ FTS are unbounded as $N$ diverges and if the $(r+1)$th eigenvalue is bounded, then we can represent
each FTS as a sum of a common component driven by $r$ factors, common to all the series, and a weakly
cross-correlated idiosyncratic component (all the eigenvalues of the corresponding covariance
operator bounded as $N\to\infty$). Our model and theory are developed in a general Hilbert space
setting that allows panels mixing functional and scalar time series. We then turn to the estimation
of the factors, their loadings, and the common components. We derive consistency results in the
asymptotic regime where the number $N$ of series and the number $T$ of time observations diverge,
thus exemplifying the "blessing of dimensionality" that explains the success of factor models
in the context of high-dimensional (scalar) time series. Our results encompass the scalar factor
models, for which they reproduce and extend, under weaker conditions, well-established results
(bai & Ng 2002). We provide numerical illustrations that corroborate the convergence rates predicted
by the theory, and provide finer understanding of the interplay between $N$ and $T$ for estimation
purposes. We conclude with an empirical illustration on a dataset of intraday S&P100 and Eurostoxx
50 stock returns, along with their scalar overnight returns.
