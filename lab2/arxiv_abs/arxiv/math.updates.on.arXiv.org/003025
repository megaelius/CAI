Studying the landscape of nonconvex cost function is key towards a better understanding of optimization
algorithms widely used in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning. Meanwhile, the
famous Kuramoto model has been an important mathematical model to study the synchronization phenomena
of coupled oscillators over various network topologies. In this paper, we bring together these
two seemingly unrelated objects by investigating the optimization landscape of a nonlinear function
$E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{1\leq i,j\leq n} a_{ij}(1-\cos(\theta_i - \theta_j))$
associated to an underlying network and exploring the relationship between the existence of local
minima and network topology. This function arises naturally in Burer-Monteiro method applied
to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization as well as matrix completion on the torus. Moreover, it corresponds
to the energy function of the homogeneous Kuramoto model on complex networks for coupled oscillators.
We prove the minimizer of the energy function is unique up to a global translation under deterministic
dense graphs and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs with tools from optimization and random matrix
theory. Consequently, the stable equilibrium of the corresponding homogeneous Kuramoto model
is unique and the basin of attraction for the synchronous state of these coupled oscillators is the
whole phase space minus a set of measure zero. In addition, our results address when the Burer-Monteiro
method recovers the ground truth exactly from highly incomplete observations in $\mathbb{Z}_2$
synchronization and shed light on the robustness of nonconvex optimization algorithms against
certain types of so-called monotone adversaries. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate
our results.
