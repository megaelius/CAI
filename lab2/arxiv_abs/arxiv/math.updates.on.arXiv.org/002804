Using recently introduced Debord-Skandalis Blup's groupoids we study index theory for a compact
foliated manifold with boundary inducing a foliation in its boundary. For this we consider first
a blup groupoid whose Lie algebroid has sections consisting of vector fields tangent to the leaves
in the interior and tangent to the leaves of the foliation in the boundary. In particular the holonomy
$b$-groupoid allows us to consider the appropriate pseudodifferential calculus and the appropriate
index problems. We further use the blup groupoids as the one above, and in particular its functoriality
properties, to actually get index theorems. In this situtation there are two index morphisms, one
related to ellipticity and a second one related to fully ellipticity. For the first one, we are able
to extend to this setting the longitudinal Connes-Skandalis index theorem and to use it to get that
a $b$-longitudinal elliptic operator can be perturbed (up stable homotopy within elliptic operators)
with a regularizing operator in the calculus to get a fully elliptic operator if and only if a certain
boundary topological index vanishes. For example in the case of a fibration (family case) this topological
obstruction is always zero. For the second index morphism, the one related to fully elliptic operators
(families of Fredholm operators), we restrict ourselves to the case of families of manifolds with
boundary and we prove a new K-theoretical index theorem, i.e. construct a topological index and
prove the equality with the analytic-Fredholm index, and use it to get a cohomological index formula
for every fully elliptic operator. In particular, for a perturbed family of generalized Dirac operators
we can compare our formula with the one by Melrose-Piazza to get a new geometric expression for the
eta form of the family.
