One may think of a $d$-class association scheme as a $(d+1)$-dimensional matrix algebra over $\mathbb{R}$
closed under Schur products. In this context, an imprimitive scheme is one which admits a subalgebra
of block matrices, also closed under the Schur product. Such systems of imprimitivity provide us
with quotient schemes, smaller association schemes which are often easier to understand, providing
useful information about the structure of the larger scheme. For any association scheme we find
a basis of $d+1$ idempotent matrices for the algebra. A cometric scheme is one whose idempotent basis
may be ordered $E_0,E_1,...,E_d$ with polynomials $f_0,f_1,...,f_d$ giving $f_i\circ(E_1)=E_i$
and deg$(f_i)=i$ for each $i$. Throughout this thesis we are primarily interested in three goals:
building new examples of cometric schemes, drawing connections between cometric schemes and other
objects, and finding new realizability conditions on feasible parameter sets --- using these conditions
to rule out open parameter sets when possible. After introducing association schemes, this thesis
focuses on a few recent results regarding cometric schemes with small $d$. We begin by examining
the matrix algebra, looking for low rank positive semidefinite matrices with few distinct entries
and later establishing new conditions on realizable parameter sets. We then focus on imprimitive
examples of both 3- and 4-class cometric schemes, generating new examples of the former while building
realizability conditions for both. In each case, we examine the related $t$-distance sets, giving
conditions which work towards equivalence; in the case of 3-class $Q$-antipodal schemes an equivalence
is established. We conclude by partially extending a result of Brouwer and Koolen concerning the
connectivity of graphs arising from metric schemes.
