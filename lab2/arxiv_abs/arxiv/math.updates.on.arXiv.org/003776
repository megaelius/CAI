Given graphs $H_1,H_2$, a graph $G$ is $(H_1,H_2)$-Ramsey if for every colouring of the edges of
$G$ with red and blue, there is a red copy of $H_1$ or a blue copy of $H_2$. In this paper we investigate
Ramsey questions in the setting of randomly perturbed graphs: this is a random graph model introduced
by Bohman, Frieze and Martin in which one starts with a dense graph and then adds a given number of random
edges to it. The study of Ramsey properties of randomly perturbed graphs was initiated by Krivelevich,
Sudakov and Tetali in 2006; they determined how many random edges must be added to a dense graph to
ensure the resulting graph is with high probability $(K_3,K_t)$-Ramsey (for $t\ge 3$). They also
raised the question of generalising this result to pairs of graphs other than $(K_3,K_t)$. We make
significant progress on this question, giving a precise solution in the case when $H_1=K_s$ and
$H_2=K_t$ where $s,t \ge 5$. Although we again show that one requires polynomially fewer edges than
in the purely random graph, our result shows that the problem in this case is quite different to the
$(K_3,K_t)$-Ramsey question. Moreover, we give bounds for the corresponding $(K_4,K_t)$-Ramsey
question; together with a construction of Powierski this resolves the $(K_4,K_4)$-Ramsey problem.
We also give a precise solution to the analogous question in the case when both $H_1=C_s$ and $H_2=C_t$
are cycles. Additionally we consider the corresponding multicolour problem. Our final result
gives another generalisation of the Krivelevich, Sudakov and Tetali result. Specifically, we
determine how many random edges must be added to a dense graph to ensure the resulting graph is with
high probability $(C_s,K_t)$-Ramsey (for odd $s\ge 5$ and $t\ge 4$).
