In this paper we recall that by construction Elko spinor fields of {\lambda} and {\rho} types satisfy
a coupled system of first order partial differential equations (csfopde) that once interacted
leads to Klein-Gordon equations for the {\lambda} and {\rho} type fields. Since the csfopde is the
basic one and since the Klein-Gordon equations for {\lambda} and {\rho} possess solutions that
are not solutions of the csfopde for {\lambda} and {\rho} we infer that it is legitimate to attribute
to those fields mass dimension 3/2 (as is the case of Dirac spinor fields) and not mass dimension 1
as previously suggested in recent literature (see list of references). A proof of this fact is offered
by deriving the csfopde for the {\lambda} and {\rho} from a Lagrangian where these fields have indeed
mass dimension 3/2. Taking seriously the view that Elko spinor fields due to its special properties
given by their bilinear invariants may be the description of some kind of particles in the real world
a question then arises: what is the physical meaning of these fields? Here we proposed that the fields
{\lambda} and {\rho} serve the purpose of building the fields K and M (see Eq.(38))which are Clifford
valued multiform fields representing spinor fields in the Clifford bundle. They are electrically
neutral and do not couple to the electromagnetic field but carry magnetic like charges which permit
them to couple to a su(2) valued potential. If the potential is of short range the particles described
by the K and M fields may be interacting and forming condensates of zero spin particles analogous
to dark matter, in the sense that they do not couple with the electromagnetic field (generated by
charged particles) and are thus invisible. We calculate the correct propagators for the K and M fields.
We discuss also the main difference between Elko and Majorana spinor fields.
