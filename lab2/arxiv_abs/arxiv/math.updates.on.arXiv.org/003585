An almost disjoint family $\mathcal A$ of subsets of $\mathbb N$ is said to be $\mathbb R$-embeddable
if there is a function $f:\mathbb N\rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that the sets $f[A]$ are ranges of
real sequences converging to distinct reals for distinct $A\in \mathcal A$. It is well known that
almost disjoint families which have few separations, such as Luzin families, are not $\mathbb R$-embeddable.
We study extraction principles related to $\mathbb R$-embeddability and separation properties
of almost disjoint families of $\mathbb N$ as well as their limitations. An extraction principle
whose consistency is our main result is: every almost disjoint family of size continuum contains
an $\mathbb R$-embeddable subfamily of size continuum. It is true in the Sacks model. The Cohen model
serves to show that the above principle does not follow from the fact that every almost disjoint family
of size continuum has two separated subfamilies of size continuum. We also construct in ZFC an almost
disjoint family, where no two uncountable subfamilies can be separated but always a countable subfamily
can be separated from any disjoint subfamily. Using a refinement of the $\mathbb R$-embeddability
property called a controlled $\mathbb R$-embedding property we obtain the following results concerning
Akemann-Doner C*-algebras which are induced by uncountable almost disjoint families: a) In ZFC
there are Akemann-Doner C*-algebras of density $\mathfrak c$ with no commutative subalgebras
of density $\mathfrak c$, b) It is independent from ZFC whether there is an Akemann-Doner algebra
of density $\mathfrak c$ with no nonseparable commutative subalgebra. This completes an earlier
result that there is in ZFC an Akemann-Doner algebra of density $\omega_1$ with no nonseparable
commutative subalgebra.
