This paper is devoted to the problem of recovering a potential $q$ in a domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$d \geq 3$ from the Dirichlet to Neumann map. This problem is related to the inverse Calder\'on conductivity
problem via the Liouville transformation. It is known from the work of Haberman and Tataru [11] and
Nachman and Lavine [17] that uniqueness holds for the class of conductivities of one derivative
and the class of $W^{2,d/2}$ conductivities respectively. The proof of Haberman and Tataru is based
on the construction of complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions initially suggested by Sylvester
and Uhlmann [22], in functional spaces introduced by Bourgain [2]. The proof of the second result,
in the work of Ferreira et al. [10], is based on the construction of CGO solutions via Carleman estimates.
The main goal of the paper is to understand whether or not an approach which is based on the construction
of CGO solutions in the spirit of Sylvester and Uhlmann and involves only standard Sobolev spaces
can be used to obtain these results. In fact, we are able to obtain a new proof of uniqueness for the
Calder\'on problem for 1) a slightly different class as the one in [11], and for 2) the class of $W^{2,d/2}$
conductivities. The proof of statement 1) is based on a new estimate for CGO solutions and some averaging
estimates in the same spirit as in [11]. The proof of statement 2) is on the one hand based on a generalized
Sobolev inequality due to Kenig et al. [14] and on another hand, only involves standard estimates
for CGO solutions [22]. We are also able to prove the uniqueness of a potential for 3) the class of $W^{s,
3/s}$ ($\supsetneqq W^{2, 3/2}$) conductivities with $3/2 < s < 2$ in three dimensions. As
far as we know, statement 3) is new.
