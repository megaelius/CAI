One part of Coleman and Mazur's halo conjecture says that the (re-normalized) slopes of overconvergent
eigenforms lying over the boundary of weight space are in a disjoint union of arithmetic progressions
of rational numbers. Extensive computational evidence (by Buzzard) and all currently known results
(by Buzzard, Kilford, McMurdy, and Roe) indicate that the slopes on the locally reducible part of
the eigencurve over the boundary of weight space are actually integers. Buzzard and Gee formulated
a conjecture which suggests that there is a local reason behind this: their conjecture says that
the reductions modulo $p$ of certain crystabelline representations are irreducible if their (re-normalized)
slopes are not integers. We prove this conjecture for slopes up to $\tfrac{p-1}{2}$ outside of a
small exceptional region, and we show that this exceptional region contains counterexamples to
the conjecture (i.e. locally reducible representations). We suspect that the eigenvalues of $U_p$
avoid this exceptional region, which is surprising. Thus, on one hand, the main result in this paper
implies that the local situation is more complicated than the global situation and that an optimal
global result is unlikely to be proved locally. On the other hand, the slopes in the exceptional region
are half-integers, so the main result in this paper proves (locally) that the slopes on the locally
reducible part of the eigencurve over the boundary of weight space are half-integers up to a certain
point. Moreover, we suspect that the exceptional region consists only of half-integer slopes even
past that point, so that a proof of a revised version of the local conjecture would provide evidence
supporting the halo conjecture just the same.
