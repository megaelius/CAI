Enabling technologies for energy sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) are of paramount importance
since the proliferation of high data communication demands of low power network devices. In this
paper, we consider a Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) multicasting IoT system comprising of
a multiantenna Transmitter (TX) simultaneously transferring information and power to low power
and data hungry IoT Receivers (RXs). Each IoT device is assumed to be equipped with Power Splitting
(PS) hardware that enables Energy Harvesting (EH) and imposes an individual Quality of Service
(QoS) constraint to the downlink communication. We study the joint design of TX precoding and IoT
PS ratios for the considered MISO Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT)
multicasting IoT system with the objective of maximizing the minimum harvested energy among IoT,
while satisfying their individual QoS requirements. In our novel EH fairness maximization formulation,
we adopt a generic Radio Frequency (RF) EH model capturing practical rectification operation,
and resulting in a nonconvex optimization problem. For this problem, we first present an equivalent
semi-definite relaxation formulation and then prove it possesses unique global optimality. We
also derive tight upper and lower bounds on the globally optimal solution that are exploited in obtaining
low complexity algorithmic implementations for the targeted joint design. Analytical expressions
for the optimal TX beamforming directions, power allocation, and IoT PS ratios are also presented.
Our representative numerical results including comparisons with benchmark designs corroborate
the usefulness of proposed framework and provide useful insights on the interplay of critical system
parameters.
