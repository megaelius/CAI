Weighting methods are widely used to adjust for covariates in observational studies, sample surveys,
and regression settings. In this paper, we study a class of recently proposed weighting methods
which find the weights of minimum dispersion that approximately balance the covariates. We call
these weights "minimal weights" and study them under a common optimization framework. The key observation
is the connection between approximate covariate balance and shrinkage estimation of the propensity
score. This connection leads to both theoretical and practical developments. From a theoretical
standpoint, we characterize the asymptotic properties of minimal weights and show that, under
standard smoothness conditions on the propensity score function, minimal weights are consistent
estimates of the true inverse probability weights. Also, we show that the resulting weighting estimator
is consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. From a practical standpoint,
we present a finite sample oracle inequality that bounds the loss incurred by balancing more functions
of the covariates than strictly needed. This inequality shows that minimal weights implicitly
bound the number of active covariate balance constraints. We finally provide a tuning algorithm
for choosing the degree of approximate balance in minimal weights. We conclude the paper with four
empirical studies that suggest approximate balance is preferable to exact balance, especially
when there is limited overlap in covariate distributions. In these studies, we show that the root
mean squared error of the weighting estimator can be reduced by as much as a half with approximate
balance.
