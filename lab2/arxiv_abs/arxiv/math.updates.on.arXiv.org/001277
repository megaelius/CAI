This paper establishes the global existence and regularity for a system of the two-dimensional
(2D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with only directional hyperresistivity. More precisely,
the equation of $b_1$ (the horizontal component of the magnetic field) involves only vertical hyperdiffusion
(given by $\Lambda_2^{2\beta} b_1$) while the equation of $b_2$ (the vertical component) has only
horizontal hyperdiffusion (given by $\Lambda_1^{2\beta} b_2$), where $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$
are directional Fourier multiplier operators with the symbols being $|\xi_1|$ and $|\xi_2|$,
respectively. We prove that, for $\beta>1$, this system always possesses a unique global-in-time
classical solution when the initial data is sufficiently smooth. The model concerned here is rooted
in the MHD equations with only magnetic diffusion, which play a significant role in the study of magnetic
reconnection and magnetic turbulence. In certain physical regimes and under suitable scaling,
the magnetic diffusion becomes partial (given by part of the Laplacian operator). There have been
considerable recent developments on the fundamental issue of whether classical solutions of these
equations remain smooth for all time. The papers of Cao-Wu-Yuan \cite{CaoWuYuan} and of Jiu-Zhao
\cite{JiuZhao2} obtained the global regularity when the magnetic diffusion is given by the full
fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^\beta$ with $\beta>1$. The main result presented in this paper
requires only directional fractional diffusion and yet we prove the regularization in all directions.
The proof makes use of a key observation on the structure of the nonlinearity in the MHD equations
and technical tools on Fourier multiplier operators such as the H\"{o}rmander-Mikhlin multiplier
theorem. The result presented here appears to be the sharpest for the 2D MHD equations with partial
magnetic diffusion.
