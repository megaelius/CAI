Consider a large linear system where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix with independent real standard
Gaussian entries, $\boldsymbol{1}_n$ is a $n\times 1$ vector of ones and with unknown the $n\times
1$ vector $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ satisfying$$\boldsymbol{x}_n = \boldsymbol{1}_n +\frac 1{\alpha_n\sqrt{n}}
A_n \boldsymbol{x}_n\, .$$We investigate the (componentwise) positivity of the solution $\boldsymbol{x}_n$
depending on the scaling factor $\alpha_n$ as the dimension $n$ goes to $\infty$. We prove that there
is a sharp phase transition at the threshold $\alpha^*_n =\sqrt{2\log n}$: below the threshold
($\alpha_n\ll \sqrt{2\log n}$), $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ has negative components with probability
tending to 1 while above ($\alpha_n\gg \sqrt{2\log n}$), all the vector's components are eventually
positive with probability tending to 1. At the critical scaling $\alpha^*_n$, we provide a heuristics
to evaluate the probability that $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ is positive.Such linear systems arise as
solutions at equilibrium of large Lotka-Volterra systems of differential equations, widely used
to describe large biological communities with interactions such as foodwebs for instance. In the
domaine of positivity of the solution $\boldsymbol{x}_n$, that is when $\alpha_n\gg \sqrt{2\log
n}$, we establish that the Lotka-Volterra system of differential equations whose solution at equilibrium
is precisely $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ is stable in the sense that its jacobian $${\mathcal J}(\boldsymbol{x}_n)
= \mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{x}_n)\left(-I_n + \frac {A_n}{\alpha_n\sqrt{n}}\right)$$ has
all its eigenvalues with negative real part with probability tending to one. Our results shed a new
light and complement the understanding of feasibility and stability issues for large biological
communities with interaction.
