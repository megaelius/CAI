In the first part of the paper, we clarify the connections between several algebraic objects appearing
in matroid theory: both partial fields and hyperfields are fuzzy rings, fuzzy rings are tracts,
and these relations are compatible with the respective matroid theories. Moreover, fuzzy rings
are ordered blueprints and lie in the intersection of tracts with ordered blueprints; we call the
objects of this intersection pastures. In the second part, we construct moduli spaces for matroids
over pastures. We show that, for any non-empty finite set $E$, the functor taking a pasture $F$ to
the set of isomorphism classes of rank-$r$ $F$-matroids on $E$ is representable by an ordered blue
scheme $Mat(r,E)$, the moduli space of rank-$r$ matroids on $E$. In the third part, we draw conclusions
on matroid theory. A classical rank-$r$ matroid $M$ on $E$ corresponds to a $\mathbb{K}$-valued
point of $Mat(r,E)$ where $\mathbb{K}$ is the Krasner hyperfield. Such a point defines a residue
pasture $k_M$, which we call the universal pasture of $M$. We show that for every pasture $F$, morphisms
$k_M\to F$ are canonically in bijection with $F$-matroid structures on $M$. An analogous weak universal
pasture $k_M^w$ classifies weak $F$-matroid structures on $M$. The unit group of $k_M^w$ can be
canonically identified with the Tutte group of $M$. We call the sub-pasture $k_M^f$ of $k_M^w$ generated
by ``cross-ratios' the foundation of $M$,. It parametrizes rescaling classes of weak $F$-matroid
structures on $M$, and its unit group is coincides with the inner Tutte group of $M$. We show that a
matroid $M$ is regular if and only if its foundation is the regular partial field, and a non-regular
matroid $M$ is binary if and only if its foundation is the field with two elements. This yields a new
proof of the fact that a matroid is regular if and only if it is both binary and orientable.
