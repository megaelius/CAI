Can we map the channels at one set of antennas and one frequency band to the channels at another set
of antennas---possibly at a different location and a different frequency band? If this channel-to-channel
mapping is possible, we can expect dramatic gains for massive MIMO systems. For example, in FDD massive
MIMO, the uplink channels can be mapped to the downlink channels or the downlink channels at one subset
of antennas can be mapped to the downlink channels at all the other antennas. This can significantly
reduce (or even eliminate) the downlink training/feedback overhead. In the context of cell-free/distributed
massive MIMO systems, this channel mapping can be leveraged to reduce the fronthaul signaling overhead
as only the channels at a subset of the distributed terminals need to be fed to the central unit which
can map them to the channels at all the other terminals. This mapping can also find interesting applications
in mmWave beam prediction, MIMO radar, and massive MIMO based positioning. In this paper, we introduce
the new concept of channel mapping in space and frequency, where the channels at one set of antennas
and one frequency band are mapped to the channels at another set of antennas and frequency band. First,
we prove that this channel-to-channel mapping function exists under the condition that the mapping
from the candidate user positions to the channels at the first set of antennas is bijective; a condition
that can be achieved with high probability in several practical MIMO communication scenarios.
Then, we note that the channel-to-channel mapping function, even if it exists, is typically unknown
and very hard to characterize analytically as it heavily depends on the various elements of the surrounding
environment. With this motivation, we propose to leverage the powerful learning capabilities
of deep neural networks ....
