We are concerned with bifurcation analysis and control of nonlinear Eulerian flows with non-resonant
n-tuple Hopf singularity. The analysis is involved with CW complex bifurcations of flow-invariant
Clifford hypertori, where we refer to these toral manifolds by toral CW complexes. We observe from
primary to tertiary flow-invariant toral CW complex bifurcations for one-parametric systems
associated with two most generic cases. In a particular case, a tertiary toral CW complex bifurcates
from and resides outside a secondary toral CW complex. When the parameter varies, the secondary
internal toral CW complex collapses with the origin. However, the tertiary external toral CW complex
continues to live even after the secondary internal toral manifold disappears. Our analysis starts
with a flow-invariant primary cell-decomposition of the state space. Each open cell admits a secondary
cell-decomposition via a smooth flow-invariant foliation. Each leaf of the foliations is a minimal
flow-invariant realization of the state space configuration for all Eulerian flows with n-tuple
Hopf singularities. Permissible leaf-vector field preserving transformations are introduced
via a Lie algebra structure for nonlinear vector fields on the leaf-manifold. Complete parametric
leaf-normal form classification is provided for singular leaf-flows. Leaf-bifurcation analysis
of leaf-normal forms are performed for three most leaf-generic cases associated with one to three
unfolding bifurcation-parameters. Leaf-bifurcation varieties are derived. Leaf-bifurcations
provides a venue for cell-bifurcation control of invariant toral CW complexes. The results are
implemented and verified using Maple for practical bifurcation control of such parametric nonlinear
oscillators.
