In 2005 J.L. Waldspurger proved the following theorem: given a finite real reflection group $W$,
the closed positive root cone is tiled by the images of the open weight cone under the action of the
linear transformations $id-w$. Shortly thereafter E. Meinrencken extended the result to affine
Weyl groups. P.V. Bibikov and V.S. Zhgoon then gave a uniform proof for a discrete reflection group
acting on a simply-connected space of constant curvature. In this paper we show that the Waldspurger
and Meinrenken theorems of type A give a new perspective on the combinatorics of the symmetric group.
In particular, for each permutation matrix $w \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ we define a non-negative integer
matrix $\mathbf{WT}(w)$, called the Waldspurger transform of $w$. The definition of the matrix
$\mathbf{WT}(w)$ is purely combinatorial but its columns are the images of the fundamental weights
under the action of $id-w$, expressed in simple root coordinates. The possible columns of $\mathbf{WT}(w)$
(which we call UM vectors) are in bijection with many interesting structures including: unimodal
Motzkin paths, abelian ideals in nilradical of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbb{C})$,
Young diagrams with maximum hook length $n$, and integer points inside a certain polytope. We show
that the sum of the entries of $\mathbf{WT}(w)$ is equal to half the entropy of the corresponding
permutation $w$, which is known to equal the rank of $w$ in the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of
the Bruhat order. Inspired by this, we extend the Waldpurger transform $\mathbf{WT}(M)$ to alternating
sign matrices $M$ and give an intrinsic characterization of the image. This provides a geometric
realization of Dedekind-MacNeille completion of the Bruhat order (a.k.a. the lattice of alternating
sign matrices).
