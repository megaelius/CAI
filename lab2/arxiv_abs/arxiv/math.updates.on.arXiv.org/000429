The universal density functional $F$ of density-functional theory is a complicated and ill-behaved
function of the density-in particular, $F$ is not differentiable, making many formal manipulations
more complicated. Whilst $F$ has been well characterized in terms of convex analysis as forming
a conjugate pair $(E,F)$ with the ground-state energy $E$ via the Hohenberg-Kohn and Lieb variation
principles, $F$ is nondifferentiable and subdifferentiable only on a small (but dense) set of its
domain. In this article, we apply a tool from convex analysis, Moreau-Yosida regularization, to
construct, for any $\epsilon>0$, pairs of conjugate functionals $({}^\epsilon\!E,{}^\epsilon\!F)$
that converge to $(E,F)$ pointwise everywhere as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0^+$, and such that ${}^\epsilon\!F$
is (Fr\'echet) differentiable. For technical reasons, we limit our attention to molecular electronic
systems in a finite but large box. It is noteworthy that no information is lost in the Moreau-Yosida
regularization: the physical ground-state energy $E(v)$ is exactly recoverable from the regularized
ground-state energy ${}^\epsilon\!E(v)$ in a simple way. All concepts and results pertaining
to the original $(E,F)$ pair have direct counterparts in results for $({}^\epsilon\! E, {}^\epsilon\!F)$.
The Moreau-Yosida regularization therefore allows for an exact, differentiable formulation
of density-functional theory. In particular, taking advantage of the differentiability of ${}^\epsilon\!F$,
a rigorous formulation of Kohn-Sham theory is presented that does not suffer from the noninteracting
representability problem in standard Kohn-Sham theory.
