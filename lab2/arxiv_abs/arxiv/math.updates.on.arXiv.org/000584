We study limit theorems of the form $$ \lim_{\eps\rightarrow 0} \eps^{-q}W_p(\mu+\eps\nu_+,
\mu+\eps\nu_-)$$ where $\mu, \nu_\pm$ are positive measures in a compact space, $supp(\nu_\pm)\subset
supp(\mu)$ and $W_p$ is the $p-$Wasserstein metric, $p>1$. This study is motivated by the request
for a-priori estimates for H\"{o}lder continuity in $W_p$ for paths of probability measures $t\mapsto
\mu_{(t)}$ which are differentiable in the total variation ($TV$) norm, i.e the distributional
derivative $\partial\mu_{(t)}/\partial t$ is a measure. Since the Wasserstein $p-$ metric $W_p$
is only controlled by $TV^{1/p}$ in a compact space, we cannot expect, in general, to obtain a finite
limit above for $q>1/p$ (corresponding to $1/p$ H\"{o}lder continuity of the path in $W_p$).
We show that better estimates on the exponent $q$ depends on the connectivity of $supp(\mu)$ together
with notion of dimension of $\mu$. In particular we prove that $q=\min(1, 1/d+1/p)$ if $\mu$ is $d-$connected
(to be defined), provided $1/d+1/p\not= 1$. The case $1/d+1/p=1$ corresponds to the critical Sobolev
embedding $\mathbb{W}^{1, p\prime}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ where $d=p\prime:=p/(p-1)$, and leads
to a log-Lipschitz estimate. The case where the support of $\mu$ is not connected corresponds to
$d=\infty$, and $q=1/p$ is the best possible estimate. In that case we may provide a sharp limit above
for $q=1/p$ ("optimal teleportation"). Surprisingly, this limit depends only on a finite number
of parameters, related to a suitably defined discrete optimal transport on a finite metric graph
whose nodes are represented by the connected components of $supp(\mu)$.
