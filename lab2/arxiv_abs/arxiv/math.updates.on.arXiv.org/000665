Given a free-by-cyclic group $G = F_N \rtimes_\varphi \mathbb{Z}$ determined by any outer automorphism
$\varphi \in \mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ which is represented by an expanding irreducible train-track
map $f$, we construct a $K(G,1)$ $2$-complex $X$ called the folded mapping torus of $f$, and equip
it with a semiflow. We show that $X$ enjoys many similar properties to those proven by Thurston and
Fried for the mapping torus of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. In particular, we construct an open,
convex cone $\mathcal{A} \subset H^1(X;\mathbb{R}) = \mathrm{Hom}(G;\mathbb{R})$ containing
the homomorphism $u_0 \colon G \to \mathbb{Z}$ having $\mathrm{ker}(u_0) = F_N$, a homology class
$\epsilon \in H_1(X;\mathbb{R})$, and a continuous, convex, homogeneous of degree $-1$ function
$\mathfrak H\colon\mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ with the following properties. Given any primitive
integral class $u \in \mathcal{A}$ there is a graph $\Theta_u \subset X$ such that: (1) the inclusion
$\Theta_u \to X$ is $\pi_1$-injective and $\pi_1(\Theta_u) = \mathrm{ker}(u)$, (2) $u(\epsilon)
= \chi(\Theta_u)$, (3) $\Theta_u \subset X$ is a section of the semiflow and the first return map
to $\Theta_u$ is an expanding irreducible train track map representing $\varphi_u \in \mathrm{Out}(\mathrm{ker}(u))$
such that $G = \mathrm{ker}(u) \rtimes_{\varphi_u} \mathbb{Z}$, (4) the logarithm of the stretch
factor of $\varphi_u$ is precisely $\mathfrak H(u)$, (5) if $\varphi$ was further assumed to be
hyperbolic and fully irreducible then for every primitive integral $u\in \mathcal{A}$ the automorphism
$\varphi_u$ of $\mathrm{ker}(u)$ is also hyperbolic and fully irreducible.
