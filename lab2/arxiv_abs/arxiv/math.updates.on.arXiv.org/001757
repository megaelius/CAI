Background: The acoustic damping in gas turbines and aero-engines relies to a great extent on acoustic
liners that consists of a cavity and a perforated face sheet. The prediction of the impedance of the
liners by direct numerical simulations is nowadays not feasible due to the hundreds to thousands
repetitions of tiny holes. We introduce a procedure to numerically obtain the Rayleigh conductivity
for acoustic liners for viscous gases at rest, and with it define the acoustic impedance of the perforated
sheet. Results: The proposed method decouples the effects that are dominant on different scales:
(a) viscous and incompressible flow at the scale of one hole, (b) inviscid and incompressible flow
at the scale of the hole pattern, and (c) inviscid and compressible flow at the scale of the wave-length.
With the method of matched asymptotic expansions we couple the different scales and eventually
obtain effective impedance conditions on the macroscopic scale. For this the effective Rayleigh
conductivity results by numerical solution of an instationary Stokes problem in frequency domain
around one hole with prescribed pressure at infinite distance to the aperture. It depends on hole
shape, frequency, mean density and viscosity divided by the area of the periodicity cell. This enables
us to estimate dissipation losses and transmission properties, that we compare with acoustic measurements
in a duct acoustic test rig with a circular cross-section by DLR Berlin. Conclusions: A precise and
reasonable definition of an effective Rayleigh conductivity at the scale of one hole is proposed
and impedance conditions for the macroscopic pressure or velocity are derived in a systematic procedure.
The comparison with experiments shows that the derived impedance conditions give a good prediction
of the dissipation losses.
