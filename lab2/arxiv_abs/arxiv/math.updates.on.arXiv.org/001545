In 2011, Meunier conjectured that for positive integers $n,k,r,s$ with $ k\geq 2$, $r\geq 2$, and
$n\geq \max (\{r,s\})k$, the chromatic number of $s$ -stable $r$-uniform Kneser hypergraphs is
equal to $\left\lceil \frac{n-\max (\{r,s\})(k-1)}{r-1}\right\rceil $. It is a strengthened
version of the conjecture proposed by Ziegler (2002), and Alon, Drewnowski and \L uczak (2009).
The problem about the chromatic number of almost $s$-stable $r$ -uniform Kneser hypergraphs has
also been introduced by Meunier (2011). For the $r=2$ case of the Meunier conjecture, Jonsson (2012)
provided a purely combinatorial proof to confirm the conjecture for $s\geq 4$ and $n$ sufficiently
large, and by Chen (2015) for even $s$ and any $n$. The case $ s=3$ is completely open, even the chromatic
number of the usual almost $s$ -stable Kneser graphs. In this paper, we obtain a topological lower
bound for the chromatic number of almost $s$-stable $r$-uniform Kneser hypergraphs via a different
approach. For the case $r=2$, we conclude that the chromatic number of almost $s$-stable Kneser
graphs is equal to $n-s(k-1)$ for all $s\geq 2$. Set $t=n-s(k-1)$. We show that any proper coloring
of an almost $s$-stable Kneser graph must contain a completely multicolored complete bipartite
subgraph $K_{\left\lceil \frac{t}{2}\right\rceil \left\lfloor \frac{t}{2} \right\rfloor
}$. It follows that the local chromatic number of almost $s$ -stable Kneser graphs is at least $\left\lceil
\frac{t}{2}\right\rceil +1$. It is a strengthened result of Simonyi and Tardos (2007), and Meunier's
(2014) lower bound for almost $s$-stable Kneser graphs.
