Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on the general linear group $GL_d(\mathbb{R})$ whose support
generates a strongly irreducible sub-semigroup. In this note, we give some new estimates for the
random walk $L_n=X_n\cdots X_1$ when $\mu$ has only a finite first moment. In particular, we prove
that for any sequence $(\epsilon_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ that tends to zero, the ratio between the
spectral radius $\rho(L_n)$ of $L_n$ and its norm $||L_n||$ is bigger than $\epsilon_n$ with a probability
tending to one. Such an information requires the study of the probability of return to neighborhoods
of hyperplanes of exponential size, the regularity of the unique stationary probability measure
on the projective space in the strongly irreducible and proximal case and the asymptotic independence
between the right and left random walk under this finite moment assumption. More general results
on the position between the Cartan and Jordan projection of a random walk on a Zariski dense sub-semigroup
of the real points of an algebraic reductive group defined over $\mathbb{R}$ are stated. As an application,
and using Benoist-Quint's central limit theorem for $\ln||L_n||$ (Theorem 1.1 of ``Central limit
theorem for linear groups''. Ann. Probab., 44(2):1308--1340, 2016), we deduce a central limit
theorem for $\ln \rho(L_n)$ when $\mu$ has a moment of order two. This result extends a result of Benoit-Quint
where this result is proved under an exponential moment of $\mu$ (Theorem 13.22 of ``Random walks
on reductive groups'', Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete. 3. Folge. A Series of
Modern Surveys in Mathematics [Results in Mathematics and Related Areas. 3rd Series. A Series of
Modern Surveys in Mathematics], 62, Springer, 2016).
