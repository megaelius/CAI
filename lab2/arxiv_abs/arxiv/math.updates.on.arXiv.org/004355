We establish new sharp inequalities of Poincar\'{e} or log-Sobolev type, on geodesically-convex
weighted Riemannian manifolds $(M,\mathfrak{g},\mu)$ whose (generalized) Ricci curvature
$Ric_{\mathfrak{g},\mu,N}$ with effective dimension parameter $N\in (-\infty,\infty]$ is
bounded from below by a constant $K\in\mathbb{R}$, and whose diameter is bounded above by $D\in
(0,\infty]$ (Curvature-Dimension-Diameter conditions $CDD(K,N,D)$). To this end we establish
a general method which complements the `localization' theorem which has recently been established
by B. Klartag. Klartag's Theorem is based on optimal transport techniques, leading to a disintegration
of the manifold measure into marginal measures supported on geodesics of the manifold. This leads
to a reduction of the problem of proving a n-dimensional inequality into an optimization problem
over a class of measures with 1-dimensional supports. In this work we firstly develop a general approach
which leads to a reduction of this optimization problem into a simpler optimization problem, on
a subclass of `model measures'. This reduction is based on functional analytic techniques, in particular
a classification of extreme points of a specific subset of measures, and showing that the solution
to the optimization problem is attained on this set of extreme points. Finally we solve the optimization
problems associated with the Poincar\'{e}, p-Poincar\'{e} and the log-Sobolev inequalities
subject to specific $CDD(K,N,D)$ conditions. Notably, we prove new sharp Poincar\'{e} inequalities
for $N\in (-\infty,0]$. We find that for $N\in (-1,0]$ the characterization of the sharp lower bound
on the Poincar\'{e} constant is of different nature; in addition we derive new lower bounds on the
log-Sobolev constant under $CDD(K,\infty,D)$ conditions where $K\in\mathbb{R}$ and $D\in (0,\infty]$,
which up to numeric constants are best possible.
