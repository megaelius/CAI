If $S$ is a topological monoid such that every homomorphism from $S$ to a second countable topological
monoid $T$ is continuous, then we say that $S$ has $automatic$ $continuity$. In this paper, we show
that many well-known, and extensively studied, monoids have automatic continuity with respect
to some natural semigroup topology. Namely, the following have automatic continuity: the monoid
$B_{\mathbb{N}}$ of all binary relations on the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$; the monoid $P_{\mathbb{N}}$
of partial transformations; the full transformation monoid $\mathbb{N} ^ \mathbb{N}$; the monoid
$\operatorname{Inj}(\mathbb{N})$ of injective transformations on $\mathbb{N}$; the symmetric
inverse monoid $I_{\mathbb{N}}$; and the monoid $C(2 ^ \mathbb{N})$ of continuous functions on
the Cantor set $2 ^ \mathbb{N}$. Additionally, we show that: $B_{\mathbb{N}}$ has no Polish semigroup
topologies; $P_{\mathbb{N}}$, $C(2 ^ \mathbb{N})$, and the monoid $C([0, 1] ^ \mathbb{N})$ of
continuous functions on the Hilbert cube $[0, 1] ^ \mathbb{N}$ each have a unique Polish semigroup
topology; the monoid $\operatorname{End}(\mathbb{Q}, \leq)$ of all order-endomorphisms of
the rational numbers, and the monoid of endomorphisms of the countable random graph (the Rado graph)
have at least one Polish semigroup topology; the monoid of self-embeddings of any Fra\"iss\'e limit
which admits proper embeddings has at least two Polish semigroup topologies; $I_{\mathbb{N}}$
has at least 3 Polish semigroup topologies, but a unique Polish inverse semigroup topology; and
$\operatorname{Inj}(\mathbb{N})$ and the monoid $\operatorname{Surj}(\mathbb{N})$ of all
surjective transformations of $\mathbb{N}$ have infinitely many distinct Polish semigroup topologies.
In proving the main results mentioned above we prove myriad ancillary results.
