We solve the Cauchy problem for the full non-linear homogeneous Boltzmann system of equations describing
multi-component monatomic gas mixtures for binary interactions in three dimensions. More precisely,
we show existence and uniqueness of the vector value solution by means of an existence theorem for
ODE systems in Banach spaces under the transition probability rates assumption corresponding
to hard potentials rates in the interval $(0,1]$, with an angular section modeled by {\color{black}
an integrable} function of the {\cfg angular transition rates modeling binary scattering effects.
The initial data for the vector valued solutions needs to be a vector of non-negative measures with
finite total number density, momentum and strictly positive energy, as well as to have a finite $L^1_{k_*}(\mathbb{R}^3)$-integrability
property corresponding to a sum across each species of $k_*$-polynomial weighted norms depending
on the corresponding mass fraction parameter for each species as much as on the intermolecular potential
rates, referred as to the scalar polynomial moment of order $k_*$}. The existence and uniqueness
rigorous results rely on a new angular averaging lemma adjusted to vector values solution that yield
a Povzner estimate with constants that decay with the order of the corresponding dimensionless
scalar polynomial moment. In addition, such initial data yields global generation of such scalar
polynomial moments at any order as well as their summability of moments to obtain estimates for corresponding
scalar exponentially decaying high energy tails, referred as to scalar exponential moments associated
to the system solution. Such scalar polynomial and exponential moments propagate as well.
