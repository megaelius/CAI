The primary objective of a safe navigation algorithm is to guide the object from its current position
to the target position while avoiding any collision with the en-route obstacles, and the appropriate
obstacle avoidance strategies are the key factors to ensure safe navigation tasks in dynamic environments.
In this report, three different obstacle avoidance strategies for safe navigation in dynamic environments
have been presented. The biologically-inspired navigation algorithm (BINA) is efficient in terms
of avoidance time. The equidistant based navigation algorithm (ENA) is able to achieve navigation
task with in uncertain dynamic environments. The navigation algorithm algorithm based on an integrated
environment representation (NAIER) allows the object to seek a safe path through obstacles in unknown
dynamic environment in a human-like fashion. The performances and features of the proposed navigation
algorithms are confirmed by extensive simulation results and experiments with a real non-holonomic
mobile robot. The algorithms have been implemented on two real control systems: intelligent wheelchair
and robotic hospital bed. The performance of the proposed algorithms with SAM and Flexbed demonstrate
their capabilities to achieve navigation tasks in complicated real time scenarios. The proposed
algorithms are easy to be implemented in real time and costly efficient. An extra study on networked
multi-robots formation building algorithm is presented in this paper. A constructive and easy-to-implement
decentralised control is proposed for a formation building of a group of random positioned objects.
Furthermore, the problem of formation building with anonymous objects is addressed. This randomised
decentralised navigation algorithm achieves the convergence to a desired configuration with
probability 1.
