We study the right and left commutation semigroups of finite metacyclic groups with trivial centre.
These are presented \[G(m,n,k) = \left\langle {a,b;{a^m} = 1,{b^n} = 1,{a^b} = {a^k}} \right\rangle
\quad (m,n,k\in\mathbb{Z}^+)\] with $(m,k - 1) = 1$ and $n = in{d_m}(k),$ the smallest positive
integer for which ${k^n} = 1\,\pmod m,$ with the conjugate of $a$ by $b$ written ${a^b}( = {b^{ - 1}}ab).$
The \emph{right} and \emph{left commutation semigroups of} $G,$ denoted ${\rm P}(G)$ and $\Lambda
(G),$ are the semigroups of mappings generated by $\rho (g):G \to G$ and $\lambda (g):G \to G$ defined
by $(x)\rho (g) = [x,g]$ and $(x)\lambda (g) = [g,x],$ where the commutator of $g$ and $h$ is defined
as $[g,h] = {g^{ - 1}}{h^{ - 1}}gh.$ This paper builds on a previous study of commutation semigroups
of dihedral groups conducted by the authors with C. Levy. Here we show that a similar approach can
be applied to $G,$ a metacyclic group with trivial centre. We give a construction of ${\rm P}(G)$
and $\Lambda (G)$ as unions of \emph{containers}, an idea presented in the previous paper on dihedral
groups. In the case that $\left\langle a \right\rangle$ is cyclic of order $p$ or ${p^2}$ or its index
is prime, we show that both ${\rm P}(G)$ and $\Lambda (G)$ are disjoint unions of maximal containers.
In these cases, we give an explicit representation of the elements of each commutation semigroup
as well as formulas for their exact orders. Finally, we extend a result of J. Countryman to show that,
for $G(m,n,k)$ with $m$ prime, the condition $\left| {{\rm P}(G)} \right| = \left| {\Lambda (G)}
\right|$ is equivalent to ${\rm P}(G) = \Lambda (G).$
