We present an Artificial Student, "Artie," for engineering science disciplines in which the mathematical
model is a partial differential equation (PDE); Artie considers here the particular case of steady
heat conduction. Artie accepts problem statements posed in natural language. Artie provides a
symbolic-numeric approximate solution: the PDE field; scalar Quantities of Interest (QoI), expressed
as functionals of the field. The problem statement will typically not provide explicit guidance
as to the equation or approximations which should be invoked. We also present Artie+, who provides
the finite element solution to the PDE: the exact solution to within a prescribed tolerance controlled
by an a posteriori error estimator. Artie comprises four technical ingredients. Natural Language
Processing: We proceed in two stages, domain-independent Google Natural Language syntax analyzer
followed by frame-specific conduction parser. PDE Template: The PDE is exploited by the conduction
parser to extract geometry, boundary conditions, and coefficients; subsequent approximations
are deduced from this ground-truth description. Problem Classes, Geometry Classes; Components,
Systems: A problem class places requirements on spatial domain, boundary conditions, properties,
and QoI; associated to each problem class are several geometry classes. A component is an instantiation
of the geometry class for prescribed geometric and PDE parameters; a system is represented as an
assembly of connected components. Variational Formulation: We consider the weak statement and
minimization principle to formulate the PDE and develop suitable approximations; implementation
proceeds through static condensation and direct stiffness assembly over component ports. We describe
and illustrate a prototype implementation of Artie and Artie+.
