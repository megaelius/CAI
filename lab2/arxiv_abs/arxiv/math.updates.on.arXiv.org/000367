The present status of the coupled-channel inverse-scattering method with supersymmetric transformations
is reviewed. We first revisit in a pedagogical way the single-channel case, where the supersymmetric
approach is shown to provide a complete solution to the inverse-scattering problem. A special emphasis
is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative transformations. In particular,
we show that for the zero initial potential, a non-conservative transformation is always equivalent
to a pair of conservative transformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the
inversion of the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then summarize
and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress remaining difficulties and
open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel examples to illustrate general principles
while keeping mathematics as simple as possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between
the equal-threshold and different-threshold problems. For equal thresholds, conservative transformations
can provide non-diagonal Jost and scattering matrices. Iterations of such transformations are
shown to lead to practical algorithms for inversion. A convenient technique where the mixing parameter
is fitted independently of the eigenphases is developed with iterations of pairs of conjugate transformations
and applied to the neutron-proton triplet S-D scattering matrix, for which exactly-solvable matrix
potential models are constructed. For different thresholds, conservative transformations do
not seem to be able to provide a non-trivial coupling between channels. In contrast, a single non-conservative
transformation can generate coupled-channel potentials starting from the zero potential and
is a promising first step towards a full solution to the coupled-channel inverse problem with threshold
differences.
