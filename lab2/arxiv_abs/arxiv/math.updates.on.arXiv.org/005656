This note presents a unified analysis of the identification of dynamical systems with low-rank
constraints under high-dimensional scaling. This identification problem for dynamic systems
are challenging due to the intrinsic dependency of the data. To alleviate this problem, we first
formulate this identification problem into a multivariate linear regression problem with row-sub-Gaussian
measurement matrix using the more general input designs and the independent repeated sampling
schemes. We then propose a nuclear norm heuristic method that estimates the parameter matrix of
dynamic system from a few input-state data samples. Based on this, we can extend the existing results.
In this paper, we consider two scenarios. (i) In the noiseless scenario, nuclear-norm minimization
is introduced for promoting low-rank. We define the notion of weak restricted isometry property,
which is weaker than the ordinary restricted isometry property, and show it holds with high probability
for the row-sub-Gaussian measurement matrix. Thereby, the rank-minimization matrix can be exactly
recovered from finite number of data samples. (ii) In the noisy scenario, a regularized framework
involving nuclear norm penalty is established. We give the notion of operator norm curvature condition
for the loss function, and show it holds for row-sub-Gaussian measurement matrix with high probability.
Consequently, when specifying the suitable choice of the regularization parameter, the operator
norm error of the optimal solution of this program has a sharp bound given a finite amount of data samples.
This operator norm error bound is stronger than the ordinary Frobenius norm error bound obtained
in the existing work.
