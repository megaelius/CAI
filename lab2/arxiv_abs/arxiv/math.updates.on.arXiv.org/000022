Patterns of animate and inanimate systems show remarkable similarities in their aggregation.
One similarity is the double-Pareto distribution of the aggregate-size of system components.
Different models have been developed to predict aggregates of system components. However, not
many models have been developed to describe probabilistically the aggregate-size distribution
of any system regardless of the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of the aggregation process. Here
we consider natural animate systems, from one of the greatest mammals - the African elephant (\textit{Loxodonta
africana}) - to the \textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria, and natural inanimate systems in river
basins. Considering aggregates as islands and their perimeter as a curve mirroring the sculpting
network of the system, the probability of exceedence of the drainage area, and the Hack's law are
shown to be the the Kor\v{c}ak's law and the perimeter-area relationship for river basins. The perimeter-area
relationship, and the probability of exceedence of the aggregate-size provide a meaningful estimate
of the same fractal dimension. Systems aggregate because of the influence exerted by a physical
or processes network within the system domain. The aggregate-size distribution is accurately
derived using the null-method of box-counting on the occurrences of system components. The importance
of the aggregate-size spectrum relies on its ability to reveal system form, function, and dynamics
also as a function of other coupled systems. Variations of the fractal dimension and of the aggregate-size
distribution are related to changes of systems that are meaningful to monitor because potentially
critical for these systems.
