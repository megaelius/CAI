In this paper, we study multistage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MS-MINLP). This
general class of problems encompasses, as important special cases, multistage stochastic convex
optimization with non-Lipschitz-continuous value functions and multistage stochastic mixed-integer
linear optimization. We develop stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) type algorithms with
nested decomposition, deterministic sampling, and stochastic sampling. The key ingredient is
a new type of cuts based on generalized conjugacy. Several interesting classes of MS-MINLP are identified,
where the new algorithms are guaranteed to obtain the global optimum without the assumption of complete
recourse. This significantly generalizes the classic nested Benders decomposition, SDDP, and
SDDiP algorithms. We also characterize the iteration complexity of the proposed algorithms. In
particular, for a $(T+1)$-stage stochastic MINLP with $d$-dimensional state spaces, to obtain
an $\epsilon$-optimal root node solution, we prove that the number of iterations of the proposed
deterministic sampling algorithm is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}((\frac{2T}{\epsilon})^d)$,
and is lower bounded by $\mathcal{O}((\frac{T}{2\epsilon})^d)$ for the nonconvex case or by $\mathcal{O}((\frac{T}{8\epsilon})^{d/2-1})$
for the convex case. This shows that the obtained complexity bounds are rather sharp. It also reveals
that the iteration complexity depends polynomially on the number of stages. We further show that
the iteration complexity depends \emph{linearly} on $T$, if all the state spaces are finite sets,
or if we seek an $(T\epsilon)$-optimal solution when the state spaces are infinite sets, i.e. allowing
the optimality gap to scale with $T$.
