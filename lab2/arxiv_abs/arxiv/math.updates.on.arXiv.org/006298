Traditional seismic acquisition systems suffer from a number of difficulties related to telemetry
cables that are used as a means of data transmission. Transforming the traditional seismic acquisition
system to a wireless system has been considered as a potential solution to most of these difficulties.
The wireless seismic acquisition system has to serve a huge aggregate data rate requirement as is
usually the case in a large wireless sensor network. This paper considers the wireless acquisition
system, and studies the maximum achievable transmission data rates from the geophones to the wireless
gateways. Successive interference cancellation decoding is assumed to be used at the gateway nodes.
We consider the problem of sum-rate maximization by optimizing the decoding process at each gateway
node. The optimization searches for optimal decoding set at each gateway, i.e. which group of geophones
will be decoded at each gateway. Various integer programming algorithms are proposed for solving
the maximization problem. These optimization algorithms are simulated and compared among each
other, where it is shown that the ant system algorithm achieves the highest sum-rate with lower computational
complexity compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, the data delivery from the gateways to the
data center is also considered. In this stage, two gateways with different buffer sizes are studied.
For small-size buffers, two optimization problems are identified and solved. The first problem
considers the minimization of the total power of the gateways, and the second problem considers
power fairness between the gateways. For large-size buffers, the problem of maximizing the weighted
sum rate of the gateways is solved.
