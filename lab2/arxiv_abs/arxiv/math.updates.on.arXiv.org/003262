Given a collection of strings, each with an associated probability of occurrence, the guesswork
of each of them is their position in a list ordered from most likely to least likely, breaking ties
arbitrarily. Guesswork is central to several applications in information theory: Average guesswork
provides a lower bound on the expected computational cost of a sequential decoder to decode successfully
the transmitted message; the complementary cumulative distribution function of guesswork gives
the error probability in list decoding; the logarithm of guesswork is the number of bits needed in
optimal lossless one-to-one source coding; and guesswork is the number of trials required of an
adversary to breach a password protected system in a brute-force attack. In this paper, we consider
memoryless string-sources that generate strings consisting of i.i.d. characters drawn from a
finite alphabet, and characterize their corresponding guesswork. Our main tool is the tilt operation.
We show that the tilt operation on a memoryless string-source parametrizes an exponential family
of memoryless string-sources, which we refer to as the tilted family. We provide an operational
meaning to the tilted families by proving that two memoryless string-sources result in the same
guesswork on all strings of all lengths if and only if their respective categorical distributions
belong to the same tilted family. Establishing some general properties of the tilt operation, we
generalize the notions of weakly typical set and asymptotic equipartition property to tilted weakly
typical sets of different orders. We use this new definition to characterize the large deviations
for all atypical strings and characterize the volume of weakly typical sets of different orders.
We subsequently build on this characterization to prove large deviation bounds on guesswork and
provide an accurate approximation of its PMF.
