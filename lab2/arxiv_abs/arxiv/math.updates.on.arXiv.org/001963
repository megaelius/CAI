Recent decades are put a lots of efforts to develop higher-order scheme for convective term approximation
that is stable and reliable. On the other hand, diffusion terms are easily approximated with numerical
schemes with at least second accuracy. The reason is that numerical schemes for diffusion term approximation
as central difference correspond to process that is described by diffusion terms. Diffusion is
exchange of a property in all directions and approximation schemes also include all surrounding
nodes. The convection is transport a property along the streamline and information propagation
is unidirectional, i.e. transported property depends on previous values along the streamline
but does not depend on next values. Convective term approximation schemes that contain upwind nodes
along the streamline correspond to convection while the others do not correspond to convection.
Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) schemes use downstream information about transported property
that corresponds to diffusion and is not included in convective terms. This is their problem and
the reason for their limited application. In this paper is presented approximation approach for
convective terms that use only upstream points, requires less iterations than TVD schemes, and
its accuracy is second order. Here are considered standard test problems: advection of a step profile,
advection of a double-step profile, advection of a sinusoidal profile, and Smith and Hutton problem.
The proposed upwind multidimansional apprach requires from 2 to 4 iterations to obtain solution
while tested TVD scheme with limiters Min-Mod, QUICK, and SUPERBEE need from 15 to 93.5 more iterations.
