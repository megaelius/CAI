We present a black-box reduction from the path version of the Traveling Salesman Problem (Path TSP)
to the classical tour version (TSP). More precisely, we show that given an $\alpha$-approximation
algorithm for TSP, then, for any $\epsilon >0$, there is an $(\alpha+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for the more general Path TSP. This reduction implies that the approximability of Path
TSP is the same as for TSP, up to an arbitrarily small error. This avoids future discrepancies between
the best known approximation factors achievable for these two problems, as they have existed until
very recently. A well-studied special case of TSP, Graph TSP, asks for tours in unit-weight graphs.
Our reduction shows that any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm for Graph TSP implies an $(\alpha+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for its path version. By applying our reduction to the $1.4$-approximation algorithm
for Graph TSP by Seb\H{o} and Vygen, we obtain a polynomial-time $(1.4+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for Graph Path TSP, improving on a recent $1.497$-approximation algorithm of Traub and
Vygen. We obtain our results through a variety of new techniques, including a novel way to set up a
recursive dynamic program to guess significant parts of an optimal solution. At the core of our dynamic
program we deal with instances of a new generalization of (Path) TSP which combines parity constraints
with certain connectivity requirements. This problem, which we call $\Phi$-TSP, has a constant-factor
approximation algorithm and can be reduced to TSP in certain cases when the dynamic program would
not make sufficient progress.
