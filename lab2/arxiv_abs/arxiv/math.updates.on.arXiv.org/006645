Let $\psi:{\mathcal{D}}\rightarrow{\mathrm{R}}$ be a harmonic function such that $\Delta \psi(x)=0$
for all $x\in\mathcal{D}\subset{\mathrm{R}}^{n}$. There are then many well-established classical
results:the Dirichlet problem and Poisson formula, Harnack inequality, the Maximum Principle,
the Mean Value Property etc. Here, a 'noisy' or random domain is one for which there also exists a classical
scalar Gaussian random field (GRF) ${\mathrm{I\!F}(x)}$ defined for all $x\in{\mathcal{D}}$
or $x\in\partial {\mathcal{D}}$ with respect to a probability space $[\Omega,\mathscr{F},{\mathsf{P}}]$.
The GRF has vanishing mean value $\mathsf{E}[\![\mathrm{I\!F}(x)]\!] = 0$ and a regulated covariance
${{\mathsf{E}}}[\![{{\mathrm{I\!F}}(x)} \otimes {{\mathrm{I\!F}}(y)}]\!] = \alpha K(x,y;\xi)$
for all $(x,y)\in{\mathcal{D}}$, with correlation length $\xi$ and ${{\mathsf{E}}}[\![{{\mathrm{I\!F}}(x)}
\otimes {{\mathrm{I\!F}}}(x)]\!] = \alpha<\infty$. The gradient $\nabla{{\mathrm{I\!F}}(x)}$
and integrals $\int_{{\mathcal{D}}}{\mathrm{I\!F}}(x) d\mu(x)$ also exist on ${\mathcal{D}}$.
Harmonic functions and potentials can become randomly perturbed GRFs of the form $\overline{\psi(x)}=\psi(x)+\lambda{{\mathrm{I\!F}}}(x)$.
Physically, this scenario arises from noisy sources or random fluctuations in mass/charge density,
noisy or random boundary/surface data; and introducing turbulence/randomness into smooth fluid
flows, steady state diffusions or heat flow. This leads to stochastic modifications of classical
theorems for randomly perturbed harmonic functions and Riesz and Newtonian potentials; and to
stability estimates for the growth and decay of their volatility and moments.
