In this paper we use the genuinely multidimensional HLL Riemann solvers recently developed by Balsara
et al. to construct a new class of computationally efficient high order Lagrangian ADER-WENO one-step
ALE finite volume schemes on unstructured triangular meshes. A nonlinear WENO reconstruction
operator allows the algorithm to achieve high order of accuracy in space, while high order of accuracy
in time is obtained by the use of an ADER time-stepping technique based on a local space-time Galerkin
predictor. The multidimensional HLL and HLLC Riemann solvers operate at each vertex of the grid,
considering the entire Voronoi neighborhood of each node and allows for larger time steps than conventional
one-dimensional Riemann solvers. The results produced by the multidimensional Riemann solver
are then used twice in our one-step ALE algorithm: first, as a node solver that assigns a unique velocity
vector to each vertex, in order to preserve the continuity of the computational mesh; second, as
a building block for genuinely multidimensional numerical flux evaluation that allows the scheme
to run with larger time steps compared to conventional finite volume schemes that use classical
one-dimensional Riemann solvers in normal direction. A rezoning step may be necessary in order
to overcome element overlapping or crossing-over. We apply the method presented in this article
to two systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, namely the Euler equations of compressible gas
dynamics and the equations of ideal classical magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). Convergence studies
up to fourth order of accuracy in space and time have been carried out. Several numerical test problems
have been solved to validate the new approach.
