Covert communication conceals transmission of messages from Alice to Bob out of a watchful adversary,
Willie, who tries to determine if a transmission took place or not. While covert communication in
a basic, vanilla setting where all variables are known to Willie, results in the well-known square-root
law, when a jammer is present and assists Alice by creating uncertainty in Willie's decoder, a strictly
positive transmission rate is possible. In this work, we analyze the case where the jammer is equipped
with multiple antennas. Specifically, we analyze the effect of multiple antennas at the jammer
on Alice's transmission power and consequently on the transmission rate. We consider both cases,
one in which the channel knowledge is known and one in which it is unknown by the jammer. We formulate
several optimization problems for the transmission strategies of the jammer, to maximize his assistance
to Alice, in terms of maximizing a ratio between Willie's and Bob's noise variances. When the channel
information is known to the jammer, we show that the optimal strategy of the jammer is to perform beamforming
towards a single direction with all his available power. This direction though, is not trivial,
since it reflects an optimal tradeoff point between minimizing the interference at Bob and maximizing
the interference at Willie. When the channel knowledge is unknown, we show that the optimal strategy
of the jammer is either to transmit isotropically to all directions or to the null-space of Bob, where
this choice depends on certain channel conditions. This is in contrast to current schemes in the
literature. Furthermore, we extend the optimization problems to the case where Bob is also equipped
with multiple antennas, and provide insightful results, shown to be asymptotically optimal, accompanied
by simulations.
