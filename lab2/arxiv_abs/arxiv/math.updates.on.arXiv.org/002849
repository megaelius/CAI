Reduced-basis methods (RB methods or RBMs) form one of the most promising techniques to deliver
numerical solutions of parametrized PDEs in real-time performance with reasonable accuracy.
For incompressible flow problems, RBMs based on LBB stable velocity-pressure spaces do not generally
inherit the stability of the underlying high-fidelity model and, instead, additional stabilization
techniques must be introduced. One way of bypassing the loss of LBB stability in the RBM is to inflate
the velocity space with supremizer modes. This however deteriorates the performance of the RBM
in the performance-critical online stage, as additional DOFs must be introduced to retain stability,
while these DOFs do not effectively contribute to accuracy of the RB approximation. In this work
we consider a velocity-only RB approximation, exploiting a solenoidal velocity basis. The solenoidal
reduced basis emerges directly from the high-fidelity velocity solutions in the offline stage.
By means of Piola transforms, the solenoidality of the velocity space is retained under geometric
transformations, making the proposed RB method suitable also for the investigation of geometric
parameters. To ensure exact solenoidality of the high-fidelity velocity solutions that constitute
the RB, we consider approximations based on divergence-conforming compatible B-splines. We show
that the velocity-only RB method leads to a significant improvement in computational efficiency
in the online stage, and that the pressure solution can be recovered a posteriori at negligible extra
cost. We illustrate the solenoidal RB approach by modeling steady two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at various angles of attack.
