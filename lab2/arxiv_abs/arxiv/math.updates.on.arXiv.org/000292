We analyze general aspects of exchangeable quantum stochastic processes, as well as some concrete
cases relevant for several applications to Quantum Physics and Probability. We establish that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between quantum stochastic processes, either preserving
or not the identity, and states on free product C*-algebras, unital or not unital respectively,
where the exchangeable ones correspond precisely to the symmetric states. We also connect some
algebraic properties of exchangeable processes, that is the fact that they satisfy the product
state or the block-singleton conditions, to some natural ergodic ones. We then specialize the investigation
for the q-deformed Commutation Relations, q in(-1,1) (the case q=0 corresponding to the reduced
group C*-algebra of the free group on infinitely many generators), and the Boolean ones. We also
provide a generalization of De Finetti Theorem to the Fermi CAR algebra (corresponding to the q-deformed
Commutation Relations with q=-1), by showing that any state is symmetric if and only if it is conditionally
independent and identically distributed with respect to the tail algebra. The Boolean stochastic
processes provide examples for which the condition to be independent and identically distributed
w.r.t. the tail algebra, without mentioning the {\it a-priori} existence of a preserving conditional
expectation, is in general meaningless in the quantum setting. Finally, we study the ergodic properties
of a class of remarkable states on the full group C*-algebra of the free group on infinitely many generators,
that is the so-called Haagerup states.
