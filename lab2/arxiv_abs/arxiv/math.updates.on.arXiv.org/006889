Sahi, Stokman, and Venkateswaran have constructed, for each positive integer $n$, a family of Laurent
polynomials depending on parameters $q$ and $k$ (in addition to $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ "metaplectic
parameters"), such that the $n=1$ case recovers the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials and the
$q\rightarrow\infty$ limit yields metaplectic Iwahori-Whittaker functions with arbitrary
Gauss sum parameters. In this paper, we study these new polynomials, which we call SSV polynomials,
in the case of $GL_r$. We apply a result of Ram and Yip in order to give a combinatorial formula for the
SSV polynomials in terms of alcove walks. The formula immediately shows that the SSV polynomials
satisfy a triangularity property with respect to a version of the Bruhat order, which in turn gives
an independent proof that the SSV polynomials are a basis for the space of Laurent polynomials. The
result is also used to show that the SSV polynomials have \emph{fewer} terms than the corresponding
Macdonald polynomials. We also record an alcove walk formula for the natural generalization of
the permuted basement Macdonald polynomials. We then construct a symmetrized variant of the SSV
polynomials: these are symmetric with respect to a conjugate of the Chinta-Gunnells Weyl group
action and reduce to symmetric Macdonald polynomials when $n=1$. We obtain an alcove walk formula
for the symmetrized polynomials as well. Finally, we calculate the $q\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow
\infty$ limits of the SSV polynomials and observe that our combinatorial formula can be written
in terms of alcove walks with only positive and negative folds respectively. In both of these $q$-limit
cases, we also observe a positivity result for the coefficients.
