We introduce a simple logical inference structure we call a $\textsf{spanoid}$ (generalizing
the notion of a matroid), which captures well-studied problems in several areas. These include
combinatorial geometry, algebra (arrangements of hypersurfaces and ideals), statistical physics
(bootstrap percolation) and coding theory. We initiate a thorough investigation of spanoids,
from computational and structural viewpoints, focusing on parameters relevant to the applications
areas above and, in particular, to questions regarding Locally Correctable Codes (LCCs). One central
parameter we study is the $\textsf{rank}$ of a spanoid, extending the rank of a matroid and related
to the dimension of codes. This leads to one main application of our work, establishing the first
known barrier to improving the nearly 20-year old bound of Katz-Trevisan (KT) on the dimension of
LCCs. On the one hand, we prove that the KT bound (and its more recent refinements) holds for the much
more general setting of spanoid rank. On the other hand we show that there exist (random) spanoids
whose rank matches these bounds. Thus, to significantly improve the known bounds one must step out
of the spanoid framework. Another parameter we explore is the $\textsf{functional rank}$ of a spanoid,
which captures the possibility of turning a given spanoid into an actual code. The question of the
relationship between rank and functional rank is one of the main questions we raise as it may reveal
new avenues for constructing new LCCs (perhaps even matching the KT bound). As a first step, we develop
an entropy relaxation of functional rank to create a small constant gap and amplify it by tensoring
to construct a spanoid whose functional rank is smaller than rank by a polynomial factor. This is
evidence that the entropy method we develop can prove polynomially better bounds than KT-type methods
on the dimension of LCCs.
