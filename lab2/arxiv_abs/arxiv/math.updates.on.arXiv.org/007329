Motivated by the recent realization of hyperbolic lattices in circuit quantum electrodynamics,
we exploit ideas from Riemann surface theory and algebraic geometry to construct the first generalization
of Bloch band theory to hyperbolic lattices, which can be formulated despite the absence of commutative
translation symmetries. For an arbitrary Hamiltonian with the symmetry of a $\{4g,4g\}$ tessellation
of the hyperbolic plane, we produce a continuous family of eigenstates that acquire Bloch-like
phase factors under the Fuchsian group of the tessellation, which is discrete but noncommutative.
Quasi-periodic Bloch wavefunctions are then generalized to automorphic functions. Naturally
associated with the Fuchsian group is a compact Riemann surface of genus $g\geq 2$, arising from
the pairwise identification of sides of a unit cell given by a hyperbolic $4g$-gon. A hyperbolic
analog of crystal momentum continuously parametrizes a discrete set of energy bands and lives in
a $2g$-dimensional torus, which is a maximal set of independent Aharonov-Bohm phases threading
the $2g$ noncontractible cycles of the Riemann surface. This torus is known in algebraic geometry
as the Jacobian of the Riemann surface. We propose the Abel-Jacobi map -- which associates to each
point of the Riemann surface a point in the Jacobian -- as a hyperbolic analog of particle-wave duality.
Point-group symmetries form a finite group of automorphisms or self-maps of the Riemann surface
and act nontrivially on the Jacobian. The tight-binding approximation and Wannier functions are
also suitably generalized. In genus $1$, our theory reduces to known band theory for $2$-dimensional
Euclidean lattices. We demonstrate our theory by explicitly computing hyperbolic Bloch wavefunctions
and bandstructures numerically for a regular $\{8,8\}$ tessellation associated with a particular
Riemann surface of genus $2$, the Bolza surface.
