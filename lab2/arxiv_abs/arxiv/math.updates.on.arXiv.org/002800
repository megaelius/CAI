We study the equation $M_\Psi(z+1)=\frac{-z}{\Psi(-z)}M_\Psi(z), M_\Psi(1)=1$ defined on
a subset of the imaginary line and where $\Psi$ is a negative definite functions. Using the Wiener-Hopf
method we solve this equation in a two terms product which consists of functions that extend the classical
gamma function. These functions are in a bijection with Bernstein functions and for this reason
we call them Bernstein-gamma functions. Via a couple of computable parameters we characterize
of these functions as meromorphic functions on a complex strip. We also establish explicit and universal
Stirling type asymptotic in terms of the constituting Bernstein function. The decay of $|M_{\Psi}(z)|$
along imaginary lines is computed. Important quantities for theoretical and applied studies are
rendered accessible. As an application we investigate the exponential functionals of Levy Processes
whose Mellin transform satisfies the recurrent equation above. Although these variables have
been intensively studied, our new perspective, based on a combination of probabilistic and complex
analytical techniques, enables us to derive comprehensive and substantial properties and strengthen
several results on the law of these random variables. These include smoothness, regularity and
analytical properties, large and small asymptotic behaviour, including asymptotic expansions,
bounds, and Mellin-Barnes representations for the density and its successive derivatives. We
also study the weak convergence of exponential functionals on a finite time horizon when the latter
expands to infinity. As a result of new factorizations of the law of the exponential functional we
deliver important intertwining relation between members of the class of positive self-similar
semigroups. The derivation of our results relies on a mixture of complex-analytical and probabilistic
techniques.
