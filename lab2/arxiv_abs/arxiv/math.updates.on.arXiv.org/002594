For any triple $(i,a,\mu)$ consisting of a vertex $i$ in a quiver $Q$, a positive integer $a$, and
a dominant $GL_a$-weight $\mu$, we define a quiver current $H^{(i,a)}_\mu$ acting on the tensor
power $\Lambda^Q$ of symmetric functions over the vertices of $Q$. These provide a quiver generalization
of parabolic Garsia-Jing creation operators in the theory of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions.
For a triple $(\mathbf{i},\mathbf{a},\mu(\bullet))$ of sequences of such data, we define the
quiver Hall-Littlewood function $H^{\mathbf{i},\mathbf{a}}_{\mu(\bullet)}$ as the result
of acting on $1\in\Lambda^Q$ by the corresponding sequence of quiver currents. The quiver Kostka-Shoji
polynomials are the expansion coefficients of $H^{\mathbf{i},\mathbf{a}}_{\mu(\bullet)}$
in the tensor Schur basis. These polynomials include the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials and parabolic
Kostka polynomials (Jordan quiver) and the Kostka-Shoji polynomials (cyclic quiver) as special
cases. We show that the quiver Kostka-Shoji polynomials are graded multiplicities in the equivariant
Euler characteristic of a vector bundle on Lusztig's convolution diagram determined by the sequences
$\mathbf{i},\mathbf{a}$. For certain compositions of currents we conjecture higher cohomology
vanishing of the associated vector bundle on Lusztig's convolution diagram. For quivers with no
branching we propose an explicit positive formula for the quiver Kostka-Shoji polynomials in terms
of catabolizable multitableaux. We also relate our constructions to $K$-theoretic Hall algebras,
by realizing the quiver Kostka-Shoji polynomials as natural structure constants and showing that
the quiver currents provide a symmetric function lifting of the corresponding shuffle product.
In the case of a cyclic quiver, we explain how the quiver currents arise in Saito's vertex representation
of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{sl}_r$.
