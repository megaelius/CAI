Relaxation and rounding approaches became a standard and extremely versatile tool for constrained
submodular function maximization. One of the most common rounding techniques in this context are
contention resolution schemes. Such schemes round a fractional point by first rounding each coordinate
independently, and then dropping some elements to reach a feasible set. Also the second step, where
elements are dropped, is typically randomized. This leads to an additional source of randomization
within the procedure, which can complicate the analysis. We suggest a different, polyhedral viewpoint
to design contention resolution schemes, which avoids to deal explicitly with the randomization
in the second step. This is achieved by focusing on the marginals of a dropping procedure. Apart from
avoiding one source of randomization, our viewpoint allows for employing polyhedral techniques.
Both can significantly simplify the construction and analysis of contention resolution schemes.
We show how, through our framework, one can obtain an optimal monotone contention resolution scheme
for bipartite matchings. So far, only very few results are known about optimality of monotone contention
resolution schemes. Our contention resolution scheme for the bipartite case also improves the
lower bound on the correlation gap for bipartite matchings. Furthermore, we derive a monotone contention
resolution scheme for matchings that significantly improves over the previously best one. At the
same time, our scheme implies that the currently best lower bound on the correlation gap for matchings
is not tight. Our results lead to improved approximation factors for various constrained submodular
function maximization problems over a combination of matching constraints with further constraints.
