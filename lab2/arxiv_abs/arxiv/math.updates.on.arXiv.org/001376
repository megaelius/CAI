Dynamic mode decomposition has emerged as a leading technique to identify spatiotemporal coherent
structures from high-dimensional data, benefiting from a strong connection to nonlinear dynamical
systems via the Koopman operator. In this work, we integrate and unify two recent innovations that
extend DMD to systems with actuation [Proctor et al., 2016] and systems with heavily subsampled
measurements [Brunton et al., 2015]. When combined, these methods yield a novel framework for compressive
system identification [code is publicly available at: https://github.com/zhbai/cDMDc]. It
is possible to identify a low-order model from limited input-output data and reconstruct the associated
full-state dynamic modes with compressed sensing, adding interpretability to the state of the
reduced-order model. Moreover, when full-state data is available, it is possible to dramatically
accelerate downstream computations by first compressing the data. We demonstrate this unified
framework on two model systems, investigating the effects of sensor noise, different types of measurements
(e.g., point sensors, Gaussian random projections, etc.), compression ratios, and different
choices of actuation (e.g., localized, broadband, etc.). In the first example, we explore this
architecture on a test system with known low-rank dynamics and an artificially inflated state dimension.
The second example consists of a real-world engineering application given by the fluid flow past
a pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. This example provides a challenging and realistic test-case
for the proposed method, and results demonstrate that the dominant coherent structures are well
characterized despite actuation and heavily subsampled data.
