We study "canonical weight decompositions" slightly generalizing that defined by J. Wildeshaus.
For an triangulated category $C$, any integer $n$, and a weight structure $w$ on $C$ a triangle $LM\to
M\to RM\to LM[1]$, where $LM$ is of weights at most $m-1$ and $RM$ is of weights at least $n+1$ for some
$m\le n$, is determined by $M$ if exists. This happens if and only if the weight complex $t(M)\in Obj
K(Hw)$ ($Hw$ is the heart of $w$) is homotopy equivalent to a complex with zero terms in degrees $m,\dots,
n$; hence this condition can be "detected" via pure functors. One can also take $m=-\infty$ or $n=+\infty$
to obtain that the weight complex functor is "conservative and detects weights up to objects of infinitely
small and infinitely large weights"; this is a significant improvement over previously known bounded
conservativity results. Applying this statement we "calculate intersections of purely generated
subcategories" and prove that certain weight-exact functors are conservative up to weight-degenerate
objects. The main tool is the new interesting notion of morphisms killing weights $m,\dots, n$ that
we study in detail as well. We apply general results to equivariant stable homotopy categories and
spherical weight structures for them (as introduced in the previous paper). We obtain that a $G$-spectrum
is without weights $m,\dots, n$ whenever its $RO(G)$-graded homology $H^G_*$ (with values in Mackey
functors) vanishes in these degrees. Moreover, we obtain a certain converse to the (equivariant)
stable Hurewicz theorem; since in the case of $G=\{e\}$ the weight complex functor essentially
calculates singular homology, the singular homology of a spectrum $E$ vanishes in negative degrees
if and only if $E$ is an extension of a connective spectrum by an acyclic one.
