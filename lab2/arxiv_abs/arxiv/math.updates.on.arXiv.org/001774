The main aim is to give a rigorous statement and proof of the slogan "the d-fold tensor product of distributions
is an Euler system for GL_d". Of the few known examples of Euler systems, we look at those of cyclotomic
units and of Beilinson-Kato elements. The cyclotomic units satisfy distribution property, and
this is the key to the proof of the norm relation property for GL_1. For the Beilinson-Kato elements,
the Siegel units satisfy distribution property, and the 2-fold tensor product, giving rise to elements
in the K_2 of modular curves, satisfies the norm relation for GL_2. We make this common property clear,
generalizing everything to GL_d. As an application (our main arithmetic result), we construct
elements in the motivic cohomology of Drinfeld modular schemes with integral coefficient and show
that the norm relation common to Euler systems (i.e., the norm of one element is described using the
local L-factor times another element) hold. This improves the older result which was done for Drinfeld
modular varieties (over the function field as opposed to the ring of integers) and with coefficients
in the rationals. We use the language of Y-sites (arXiv:1506.08023) which is introduced in order
to simplify the computation common to the theory of automorphic forms. Instead of double cosets,
we work more systematically with torsion modules and Q-morphisms between them. The idea is that
torsion modules are level structures, and Q-morphisms induce morphisms between some moduli spaces.
Chapters 1 and 3 serve as a sequel: further generalities on Y-sites, more examples of Y-sites, and
proofs of some statements in loc.cit are given. An application is also given: we provide a group theoretic
formulation of a conjecture of Tamagawa on affine curves over an algebraic closure of a finite field.
