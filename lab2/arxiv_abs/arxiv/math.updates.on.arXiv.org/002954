A (special case of a) fundamental result of Horn and Loewner [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 1969] says that
given an integer $n \geq 1$, if the entrywise application of a smooth function $f : (0,\infty) \to
\mathbb{R}$ preserves the set of $n \times n$ positive semidefinite matrices with positive entries,
then the first $n$ derivatives of $f$ are non-negative on $(0,\infty)$. Despite much interest and
activity in the literature on entrywise positivity preservers, this has remained the only known
necessary condition in fixed dimension for general preservers. On the other hand, in recent work
with Belton-Guillot-Putinar [Adv. Math. 2016] and with Tao (2017), we used local, "real analytic
versions" of this condition at the origin, and using this discovered unexpected connections between
entrywise polynomials preserving positivity and Schur polynomials. In this paper, we unify the
two stories by (i) strengthening the Horn-Loewner result to prove the positivity of the first $n$
nonzero Taylor coefficients at each point; and (ii) simultaneously unifying and extending the
state-of-the-art variants of the Horn-Loewner theorem in the literature. We also explain using
the work with Tao (2017) why our "Master Theorem A" is sharp. A key step in the proof is a new determinantal
/ symmetric function identity (Theorem B), which shows that Schur polynomials naturally arise
from considering arbitrary smooth entrywise maps; this extends known results involving polynomial
preservers. Of independent interest may be the following application to symmetric function theory
(Theorem C): we extend the Schur function expansion of the Cauchy determinant (whose matrix entries
are geometric series $1 / (1 - u_j v_k)$), as well as of a determinant of Frobenius (whose matrix entries
are a sum of two geometric series), to arbitrary power series, and over all commutative rings.
