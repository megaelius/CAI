In this work we are interested in the differential geometry of surfaces in simply isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$
and pseudo-isotropic $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ spaces, which is basically the study of $\mathbb{R}^3$
equipped with a degenerate metric such as $\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2\pm\mathrm{d}y^2$.
Extending previous results concerning simply isotropic surfaces [B. Pavkovi\'c, Glas. Mat. Ser.
III 15, 149 (1980)], here we introduce a Gauss map in both $\mathbb{I}^3$ and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$
taking values on a unit sphere of parabolic type, define a shape operator from it, and show that its
determinant and trace give the known relative Gaussian and Mean curvatures, respectively. We show
that every (admissible) pseudo-isotropic surface is timelike and that, in analogy to what happens
in Lorentzian geometry, the pseudo-isotropic shape operator may fail to be diagonalizable. We
also prove that the only totally umbilical surfaces in $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ are spheres
of parabolic type and that the curvature tensor associated with the induced Levi-Civita connection
vanishes identically for \emph{any} pseudo-isotropic surface, as happens in simply isotropic
space. Later, based on our Gauss map, we introduce a new notion of connection, named \emph{relative
connection} (or \emph{r-connection}, for short), whose curvature tensor does not vanish identically
and which is directly related to the relative Gaussian curvature. Finally, we compute the Gauss
and Codazzi-Mainardi equations for the r-connection and show that geodesics on a sphere of parabolic
type are obtained by intersections with planes passing through its center (focus).
