The high-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) has achieved success in simulating compressible flow
in Cartesian mesh. To study the flow problem in general geometry, such as the flow over a wing-body
configuration, the development of a three-dimensional HGKS in general curvilinear coordinates
becomes necessary. In this paper, a two-stage fourth-order gas-kinetic scheme is developed for
the Euler and Navier-Stokes solutions in the curvilinear coordinates. Based on the coordinate
transformation, the kinetic equation is transformed first to the computational space, and the
flux function in the gas-kinetic scheme is obtained there and is transformed back to the physical
domain for the update of conservative flow variables inside each control volume. To achieve the
expected order of accuracy, the dimension-by-dimension reconstruction based on the WENO scheme
is adopted in the computational domain, where the reconstructed variables are the cell averaged
Jacobian and the Jacobian-weighted conservative variables, and the conservative variables are
obtained by ratio of the above reconstructed data at Gaussian quadrature points of each cell interface.
In the two-stage fourth-order gas kinetic scheme (GKS), similar to the generalized Riemann solver
(GRP), the initial spatial derivatives of conservative variables have to be used in the evaluation
of the time dependent flux function in GKS, which are reconstructed as well through orthogonalization
in physical space and chain rule. A variety of numerical examples from the order tests to the solutions
with strong discontinuities are presented to validate the accuracy and robustness of the current
scheme. The precise satisfaction of the geometrical conservation law in non-orthogonal mesh is
also demonstrated through the numerical example.
