Motivated by applications, the last few years have witnessed tremendous interest in understanding
the structure as well as the behavior of dynamics for inhomogeneous random graph models. In this
study we analyze the maximal components at criticality of one famous class of such models, the rank-one
inhomogeneous random graph model. Viewing these components as measured random metric spaces,
under finite moment assumptions for the weight distribution, we show that the components in the
critical scaling window with distances scaled by $n^{-1/3}$ converge in the Gromov-Haussdorf-Prokhorov
metric to rescaled versions of the limit objects identified for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph
components at criticality Addario-Berry, Broutin and Goldschmidt (2012). A key step is the construction
of connected components of the random graph through an appropriate tilt of a famous class of random
trees called $\mathbf{p}$-trees (studied previously by Aldous, Miermont and Pitman (2004) and
by Camarri and Pitman (2000)). This is the first step in rigorously understanding the scaling limits
of objects such as the Minimal spanning tree and other strong disorder models from statistical physics
(see Braunstein et al., 2003) for such graph models. By asymptotic equivalence (Janson, 2010),
the same results are true for the Chung-Lu model and the Britton-Deijfen-Lof model. A crucial ingredient
of the proof of independent interest is tail bounds for the height of $\mathbf{p}$-trees. The techniques
developed in this paper form the main technical bedrock for proving continuum scaling limits in
the critical regime for a wide array of other random graph models (Bhamidi, Broutin, Sen and Wang,
2014) including the configuration model and inhomogeneous random graphs with general kernels
which were introduced by Bollobas, Janson and Riordan (2007).
