Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been widely used in state estimation and parameter estimation
for the dynamic system where observational data is obtained sequentially in time. To reduce uncertainty
and accelerate posterior inference, a two-stage ensemble Kalman filter is presented to improve
the sequential analysis of EnKF. It is known that the final posterior ensemble may be concentrated
in a small portion of the entire support of the initial prior ensemble. It will be much more efficient
if we first build a new prior by some partial observations, and construct a surrogate only over the
significant region of the new prior. To this end, we construct a very coarse model using generalized
multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) and generate a new prior ensemble in the first stage.
GMsFEM provides a set of hierarchical multiscale basis functions supported in coarse blocks. This
gives flexibility and adaptivity to choosing degree of freedoms to construct a reduce model. In
the second stage, we build an initial surrogate model based on the new prior by using GMsFEM and sparse
generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)-based stochastic collocation methods. To improve the initial
surrogate model, we dynamically update the surrogate model, which is adapted to the sequential
availability of data and the updated analysis. The two-stage EnKF can achieve a better estimation
than standard EnKF, and significantly improve the efficiency to update the ensemble analysis (posterior
exploration). To enhance the applicability and flexibility in Bayesian inverse problems, we extend
the two-stage EnKF to non-Gaussian models and hierarchical models. In the paper, we focus on the
time fractional diffusion-wave models in porous media and investigate their Bayesian inverse
problems using the proposed two-stage EnKF.
