In this paper, we discuss multiscale methods for nonlinear problems. The main idea of these approaches
is to use local constraints and solve problems in oversampled regions for constructing macroscopic
equations. These techniques are intended for problems without scale separation and high contrast,
which often occur in applications. For linear problems, the local solutions with constraints are
used as basis functions. This technique is called Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale
Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM). GMsFEM identifies macroscopic quantities based on rigorous
analysis. In corresponding upscaling methods, the multiscale basis functions are selected such
that the degrees of freedom have physical meanings, such as averages of the solution on each continuum.
This paper extends the linear concepts to nonlinear problems, where the local problems are nonlinear.
The main concept consists of: (1) identifying macroscopic quantities; (2) constructing appropriate
oversampled local problems with coarse-grid constraints; (3) formulating macroscopic equations.
We consider two types of approaches. In the first approach, the solutions of local problems are used
as basis functions (in a linear fashion) to solve nonlinear problems. This approach is simple to
implement; however, it lacks the nonlinear interpolation, which we present in our second approach.
In this approach, the local solutions are used as a nonlinear forward map from local averages (constraints)
of the solution in oversampling region. This local fine-grid solution is further used to formulate
the coarse-grid problem. Both approaches are discussed on several examples and applied to single-phase
and two-phase flow problems, which are challenging because of convection-dominated nature of
the concentration equation.
