In many spinning processes, as for example in dry spinning, solvent evaporates out of the spun jets
and leads to thinning and solidification of the produced fibers. Such production processes are
significantly driven by the interaction of the fibers with the surrounding airflow. Faced with
industrial applications producing up to several hundred fibers simultaneously, the direct numerical
simulation of the three-dimensional multiphase, multiscale problem is computationally extremely
demanding and thus in general not possible. In this paper, we hence propose a dimensionally reduced,
efficiently evaluable fiber model that enables the realization of fiber-air interactions in a
two-way coupling with airflow computations. For viscous dry spinning of an uni-axial two-phase
flow, we deduce one-dimensional equations for fiber velocity and stress from cross-sectional
averaging and combine them with two-dimensional advection-diffusion equations for polymer mass
fraction and temperature revealing the radial effects that are observably present in experiments.
For the numerical treatment of the resulting parametric boundary value problem composed of one-dimensional
ordinary differential equations and two-dimensional partial differential equations we develop
an iterative coupling algorithm. Thereby, the solution of the advection-diffusion equations
is implicitly given in terms of Green's functions and leads for the surface values to Volterra integral
equations of second kind with singular kernel, which we can solve very efficiently by the product
integration method. For the ordinary differential equations a suitable collocation-continuation
procedure is presented. Compared with the referential solution of a three-dimensional setting,
the numerical results are very convincing. They provide a good approximation while drastically
reducing the computational time.
