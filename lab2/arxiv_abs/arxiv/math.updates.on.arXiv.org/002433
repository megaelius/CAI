Integrating the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into the cellular network is envisioned to be a
promising technology to significantly enhance the communication performance of both UAVs and
existing terrestrial users. In this paper, we first provide an overview on the two main paradigms
in cellular UAV communications, i.e., cellular-enabled UAV communication with UAVs as new aerial
users served by the ground base stations (GBSs), and UAV-assisted cellular communication with
UAVs as new aerial communication platforms serving the terrestrial users. Then, we focus on the
former paradigm and study a new UAV trajectory design problem subject to practical communication
connectivity constraints with the GBSs. Specifically, we consider a cellular-connected UAV in
the mission of flying from an initial location to a final location, during which it needs to maintain
reliable communication with the cellular network by associating with one GBS at each time instant.
We aim to minimize the UAV's mission completion time by optimizing its trajectory, subject to a quality-of-connectivity
constraint of the GBS-UAV link specified by a minimum receive signal-to-noise ratio target. To
tackle this challenging non-convex problem, we first propose a graph connectivity based method
to verify its feasibility. Next, by examining the GBS-UAV association sequence over time, we obtain
useful structural results on the optimal UAV trajectory, based on which two efficient methods are
proposed to find high-quality approximate trajectory solutions by leveraging graph theory and
convex optimization techniques. The proposed methods are analytically shown to be capable of achieving
a flexible trade-off between complexity and performance, and yielding a solution that is arbitrarily
close to the optimal solution in polynomial time. Finally, we make concluding remarks and point
out some promising directions for future work.
