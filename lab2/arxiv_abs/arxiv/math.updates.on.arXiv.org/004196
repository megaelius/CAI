This is a paper that aims to interpret the cardinality of a set in terms of Baire Category, i.e. how
many sets that can be deleted from a set before the set itself becomes negligible. To do this natural
tree-theoretic structures such as the Baire topology are introduced, and the Baire Category Theorem
is extended to a statement that a $\aleph$-sequentially complete binary tree representation of
a Hausdorff topological space that has a clopen base of cardinality $\aleph$ and no isolated or discrete
points is not the union of $<\aleph+1$-many nowhere dense subsets for cardinal $\aleph\ge\aleph_{0}$,
where a $\aleph$-sequentially complete topological space is a space where every function $f:\aleph\rightarrow\{0.1\}$
is such that $(\forall x)(x\in f\rightarrow x\in\in X)\rightarrow(f\in X)$. It is shown that if
$\aleph<\left|X\right|\le2^{\aleph}$ for $\left|X\right|$ the cardinality of a set $X$, then
it is possible to force $\left|X\right|-\aleph\times\left|X\right|\ne\emptyset$ by deleting
a dense sequence of $\aleph$ specially selected clopen sets, while if any dense sequence of $\aleph+1$
clopen sets are deleted then $\left|X\right|-(\aleph+1)\times\left|X\right|=\emptyset$.
This gives rise to an alternative definition of cardinality as the number of basic clopen sets (intervals
in fact) needed to be deleted from a set to force an empty remainder. This alternative definition
of cardinality is consistent with and follows from the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, which
is shown by exhibiting two models of set theory, one an outer (modal) model, the other an inner, generalized
metric model with an information minimization principle.
