The $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric quantum mechanical $V=ix^3$ model over the real line, $x\in\mathbb{R}$,
is infrared (IR) truncated and considered as Sturm-Liouville problem over a finite interval $x\in\left[-L,L\right]\subset\mathbb{R}$.
Via WKB and Stokes graph analysis, the location of the complex spectral branches of the $V=ix^3$
model and those of more general $V=-(ix)^{2n+1}$ models over $x\in\left[-L,L\right]\subset\mathbb{R}$
are obtained. The corresponding eigenvalues are mapped onto $L-$invariant asymptotic spectral
scaling graphs $\mathcal{R}\subset \mathbb{C}$. These scaling graphs are geometrically invariant
and cutoff-independent so that the IR limit $L\to \infty $ can be formally taken. Moreover, an increasing
$L$ can be associated with an $\mathcal{R}-$constrained spectral UV$\to$IR renormalization
group flow on $\mathcal{R}$. The existence of a scale-invariant $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking
region on each of these graphs allows to conclude that the unbounded eigenvalue sequence of the $ix^3$
Hamiltonian over $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be considered as tending toward a mapped version of such
a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking region at spectral infinity. This provides a simple heuristic
explanation for the specific eigenfunction properties described in the literature so far and clear
complementary evidence that the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric $V=-(ix)^{2n+1}$ models over the
real line $x\in\mathbb{R}$ are not equivalent to Hermitian models, but that they rather form a separate
model class with purely real spectra. Our findings allow us to hypothesize a possible physical interpretation
of the non-Rieszian mode behavior as a related mode condensation process.
