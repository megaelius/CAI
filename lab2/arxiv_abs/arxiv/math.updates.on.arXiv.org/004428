Given a domain $D$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $K$ a compact subset of $D$, the set $\mathcal{A}_K^D$ of
all restrictions of functions holomorphic on $D$ the modulus of which is bounded by $1$ is a compact
subset of the Banach space $C(K)$ of continuous functions on $K$. The sequence $(d_m(\mathcal{A}_K^D))_{m\in
\mathbb{N}}$ of Kolmogorov $m$-widths of $\mathcal{A}_K^D$ provides a measure of the degree of
compactness of the set $\mathcal{A}_K^D$ in $C(K)$ and the study of its asymptotics has a long history,
essentially going back to Kolmogorov's work on $\epsilon$-entropy of compact sets in the 1950s.
In the 1980s Zakharyuta showed that for suitable $D$ and $K$ the asymptotics \begin{equation*}
\lim_{m\to \infty}\frac{- \log d_m(\mathcal{A}_K^D)}{m^{1/n}} = 2\pi \left ( \frac{n!}{C(K,D)}\right
) ^{1/n}\,, \end{equation*} where $C(K,D)$ is the Bedford-Taylor relative capacity of $K$ in $D$
is implied by a conjecture, now known as Zakharyuta's Conjecture, concerning the approximability
of the regularised relative extremal function of $K$ and $D$ by certain pluricomplex Green functions.
Zakharyuta's Conjecture was proved by Nivoche in 2004 thus settling the asymptotics above at the
same time. We shall give a new proof of the asymptotics above for $D$ strictly hyperconvex and $K$
of non-zero Lebesgue measure which does not rely on Zakharyuta's Conjecture. Instead we proceed
more directly by a two-pronged approach establishing sharp upper and lower bounds for the Kolmogorov
widths. The lower bounds follow from concentration results of independent interest for the eigenvalues
of a certain family of Toeplitz operators, while the upper bounds follow from an application of the
Bergman-Weil formula together with an exhaustion procedure by special holomorphic polyhedra.
