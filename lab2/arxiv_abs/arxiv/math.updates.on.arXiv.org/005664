We study the $K$-user, $M$-subchannel parallel multiple-input-single-output (MISO) broadcast
channel (BC) under arbitrary levels of partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT).
We show that the parallel subchannels constituting this setting are separable from a degrees-of-freedom
(DoF) region perspective if and only if the partial CSIT pattern is totally ordered. This total order
condition corresponds to users abiding by the same order, with respect to their CSIT quality levels,
in each of the parallel subchannels. For instance, let $\alpha_{k}^{[l]}$ and $\alpha_{j}^{[l]}$
be the CSIT quality parameters for users $k$ and $j$ over subchannel $l$. Under total order, having
$\alpha_{k}^{[l]} \geq \alpha_{j}^{[l]}$ implies that $\alpha_{k}^{[m]} \geq \alpha_{j}^{[m]}$
holds for every subchannel $m$. In this case, the entire DoF region is achievable using simple separate
coding, where a single-subchannel-type transmission scheme is employed in each subchannel. To
show this separability result, we first derive an outer bound for the DoF region by extending the
aligned image sets approach of Davoodi and Jafar to the considered setting. We then show that this
outer bound coincides with the inner bound achieved through separate coding, given by the Minkowski
sum of $M$ single-subchannel DoF regions, under the total order condition, hence settling the if
part of the main theorem. To prove the only if part of the theorem, we identify a set of DoF tuples achievable
through joint coding across subchannels, yet not achievable through separate coding whenever
the total order condition is violated. Moreover, we also highlight the implications of our main
result on the design of CSIT feedback schemes for multi-carrier multi-antenna wireless networks.
