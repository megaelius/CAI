We prove that the planar normalized orthogonal polynomials $P_{n,m}(z)$ of degree $n$ with respect
to an exponentially varying planar measure $e^{-2mQ(z)}\mathrm{dA}(z)$ enjoys an asymptotic
expansion \[ P_{n,m}(z)\sim \left(\frac{m}{2\pi}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\hspace{-3pt} \sqrt{\phi_\tau'(z)}[\phi_\tau(z)]^n
e^{m\mathcal{Q}_\tau(z)}\left(\mathcal{B}_{0,\tau}(z) +\frac{1}{m}\mathcal{B}_{1,\tau}(z)+\frac{1}{m^2}
\mathcal{B}_{2,\tau}(z)+\ldots\right), \] as $n=m\tau\to\infty$. Here $\mathcal{S}_\tau$
denotes the droplet, the boundary of which is assumed to be a smooth, simple, closed curve, and $\phi_\tau$
is a conformal mapping $\mathcal{S}_\tau^c\to\mathbb{D}_e$. The functions $\mathcal{Q}_\tau$
and $\mathcal{B}_{j,\tau}(z)$ are bounded holomorphic functions which can be computed in terms
of $Q$ and $\mathcal{S}_\tau$. We apply these results to prove universality at the boundary for
regular droplets in the random normal matrix model, i.e., that the limiting rescaled process is
the random process with correlation kernel $$ \mathrm{k}(\xi,\eta)= \frac{1}{2}e^{\xi\bar\eta\,-\frac12(\lvert\xi\rvert^2+\lvert
\eta\rvert^2)} \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\xi+\bar{\eta}}{\sqrt{2}}\right). $$ A
key ingredient in the proof of the asymptotic expansion is the construction of an {orthogonal foliation}
-- a smooth flow of closed curves near $\partial\mathcal{S}_\tau$, on each of which $P_{n,m}$ is
orthogonal to lower order polynomials, with respect to an induced measure. To compute the coefficients,
we further develop an algorithm which determines $\mathcal{B}_{j,\tau}$ up to any desired order
in terms of inhomogeneous Toeplitz kernel conditions.
