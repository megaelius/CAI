We present rigorous mathematical analyses of a number of well-known mathematical models for genetic
mutations. In these models, the genome is represented by a vertex of the $n$-dimensional binary
hypercube, for some $n$, a mutation involves the flipping of a single bit, and each vertex is assigned
a real number, called its fitness, according to some rules. Our main concern is with the issue of existence
of (selectively) accessible paths, that is, monotonic paths in the hypercube along which fitness
is always increasing. Our main results resolve open questions about three such models, which in
the biophysics literature are known as House of Cards (HoC), Constrained House of Cards (CHoC) and
Rough Mount Fuji (RMF). We prove that the probability of there being at least one accessible path
from the all-zeroes node $\bm{v^0}$ to the all-ones node $\bm{v^1}$ tends respectively to 0, 1 and
1, as $n$ tends to infinity. A crucial idea is the introduction of a generalisation of the CHoC model,
in which the fitness of $\bm{v^0}$ is set to some $\alpha = \alpha_n \in [0, 1]$. We prove that there
is a very sharp threshold at $\alpha_n = \frac{\ln n}{n}$ for the existence of accessible paths from
$\bm{v^0}$ to $\bm{v^1}$. As a corollary we prove significant concentration, for $\alpha$ below
the threshold, of the number of accessible paths about the expected value (the precise statement
is technical, see Corollary \ref{cor:aHoCconc}). In the case of RMF, we prove that the probability
of accessible paths from $\bm{v^0}$ to $\bm{v^1}$ existing tends to 1 provided the drift parameter
$\theta = \theta_n$ satisfies $n\theta_n \rightarrow \infty$, and for any fitness distribution
which is continuous on its support and whose support is connected.
