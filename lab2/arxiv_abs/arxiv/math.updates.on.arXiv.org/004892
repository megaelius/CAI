I show that there is a universal formal group (over a suitable (non-zero) ring) which is equipped
with an action of the multiplicative monoid $\mathcal{O}^\triangleright$ of non-zero elements
of the ring of integers of a $p$-adic field. Lubin-Tate formal groups also arise from this universal
formal group. If two $p$-adic fields have isomorphic multiplicative monoids $\mathcal{O}^\triangleright$
then the additive structure of one arises from that of the other by means of this universal formal
group law (in a suitable manner). In particular if two $p$-adic fields have isomorphic absolute
Galois groups then it is well-known that the two respective monoids $\mathcal{O}^\triangleright$
are isomorphic and so this construction can be applied to such $p$-adic fields. In this sense this
universal formal group law provides a single additive structure which binds together $p$-adic
fields whose absolute Galois groups are isomorphic (this anabelian variation of ring structure
is studied and used extensively by Shinichi Mochizuki). In particular one obtains a universal (additive)
expression for any non-zero $p$-adic integer (in a given $p$-adic field) which is independent of
the ring structure of the $p$-adic field (this is also inspired by Mochizuki's results). These ideas
extend to geometric situations: for a smooth curve $X/K$ there is a universal $K(X)^*$-formal group
(here $K(X)^*$ is the monoid of non-zero meromorphic functions on a smooth curve $X/K$ over a $p$-adic
field $K$, which binds together all the additive structures on $K(X)^*\cup \{0\}$ compatibly with
the universal additive structure on $K^*\cup\{0\}$ and hence a non-zero meromorphic function
on $X$ is given by a universal additive expression which is independent of the ring structure of $K(X)^*\cup\{0\}$
(this is also inspired by Mochizuki's results on Theta functions).
