In its simplest form, the competitive exclusion principle states that a number of species competing
for a smaller number of resources cannot coexist. However, it has been observed empirically that
in some settings it is possible to have coexistence. One example is Hutchinson's `paradox of the
plankton'. This is an instance where a large number of phytoplankton species coexist while competing
for a very limited number of resources. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that
temporal fluctuations of the environment can facilitate coexistence for competing species. Hutchinson
conjectured that one can get coexistence because nonequilibrium conditions would make it possible
for different species to be favored by the environment at different times. In this paper we show in
various settings how a variable (stochastic) environment enables a set of competing species limited
by a smaller number of resources or other density dependent factors to coexist. If the environmental
fluctuations are modeled by white noise, and the per-capita growth rates of the competitors depend
linearly on the resources, we prove that there is competitive exclusion. However, if either the
dependence between the growth rates and the resources is not linear or the white noise term is nonlinear
we show that coexistence on fewer resources than species is possible. Even more surprisingly, if
the temporal environmental variation comes from switching the environment at random times between
a finite number of possible states, it is possible for all species to coexist even if the growth rates
depend linearly on the resources. We show in an example (a variant of which first appeared in Benaim
and Lobry '16) that, contrary to Hutchinson's explanation, one can switch between two environments
in which the same species is favored and still get coexistence.
