In this article, we primarily propose a novel Bayesian characterization of stationary and nonstationary
stochastic processes. In practice, this theory aims to distinguish between global stationarity
and nonstationarity for both parametric and nonparametric stochastic processes. Interestingly,
our theory builds on our previous work on Bayesian characterization of infinite series, which was
applied to verification of the (in)famous Riemann Hypothesis. Thus, there seems to be interesting
and important connections between pure mathematics and Bayesian statistics, with respect to our
proposed ideas. We validate our proposed method with simulation and real data experiments associated
with different setups. In particular, applications of our method include stationarity and nonstationarity
determination in various time series models, spatial and spatio-temporal setups, and convergence
diagnostics of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our results demonstrate very encouraging performance,
even in very subtle situations. Using similar principles, we also provide a novel Bayesian characterization
of mutual independence among any number of random variables, using which we characterize the properties
of point processes, including characterizations of Poisson point processes, complete spatial
randomness, stationarity and nonstationarity. Applications to simulation experiments with
ample Poisson and non-Poisson point process models again indicate quite encouraging performance
of our proposed ideas. We further propose a novel recursive Bayesian method for determination of
frequencies of oscillatory stochastic processes, based on our general principle. Simulation
studies and real data experiments with varieties of time series models consisting of single and
multiple frequencies bring out the worth of our method.
