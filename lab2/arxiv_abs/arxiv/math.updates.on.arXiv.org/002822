Networked systems are ubiquitous in today's world with examples spanning from ecology to the social
and engineering sciences. Much of the research in networked systems is analytical, where the focus
is on characterizing (and potentially influencing) the emergent collective behavior, e.g., predicting
the distribution of animals and humans in a given ecological system. A more recent trend of research
focuses on the design of networked systems capable of achieving diverse and highly coordinated
collective behavior in the absence of centralized control, e.g., designing a team of unmanned aerial
vehicles to monitor the perimeter of a wild fire. Unfortunately, our understanding of how microscopic
behavior impacts the macroscopic phenomena in network systems is inadequate for meeting the demands
of this emerging design task. This paper focuses on an instance of this design task for a well-studied
class of coverage problems where the goal is to allocate a collection of agents to a subset of resources
in order to maximize the cumulative value of the covered resources. Our first result demonstrates
that any agent-based algorithm relying solely on local information induces a fundamental trade-off
between the best and worst case performance guarantees, as measured by the price of anarchy and price
of stability. This result highlights how the information available to the agents translates to
constraints on the achievable efficiency guarantees in networked control systems. Our second
results demonstrates how to use an additional piece of system-level information to breach these
limitations, thereby improving the system's performance.
