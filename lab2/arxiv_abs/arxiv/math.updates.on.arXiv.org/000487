Let $K/\Q$ be a finite Galois extension of degree $n$, of Galois group $G$, and let $\eta\in K^\times$.
For all large enough prime $p$ (prime to $n$, ${\rm Disc}(K)$, and $\eta$), we define, by use of the
Frobenius theorem on group determinants, the family $\big(\Delta_p^\theta(\eta) \in \F_p \big)_\theta$
of local $\theta$-regulators of $\eta$, indexed by the $\Q_p\,$-irreducible characters $\theta$
of $G$. At each $\Delta_p^\theta (\eta)$ is associated a linear representation ${\mathcal L}^\theta\simeq
\delta V_\theta$ (where $V_\theta$ is the representation of character $\theta$, $0\leq \delta
\leq \varphi(1)$, $\varphi \div \theta$ absolutely irreducible); the representation ${\mathcal
L}^\theta$ characterizes the properties of $\Delta_p^\theta (\eta)$, including its nullity
equivalent to $\delta \gt 0$ (cf. Theorem \ref{theo24}). When $\eta\in\Q^\times$ and $\theta
= 1$, $\Delta_p^1 (\eta)$ is the $p$-Fermat quotient of $\eta$. When $\eta$ is a "Minkowski unit"
(for $K$ real), each $\Delta_p^\theta (\eta)$, $\theta \ne 1$, gives the residue modulo $p$ of the
$\theta$-component ${\rm Reg}_p^\theta (\eta)$ in the factorization $\prod_{\theta\ne 1}({\rm
Reg}_p^\theta (\eta))^{\varphi(1)}$ of $p^{1-n} {\rm Reg}_p(K)$, where ${\rm Reg}_p(K)$ is
the classical $p$-adic regulator of $K$. We suggest, starting from a general property of group determinants
and the existence of the representation ${\mathcal L}^\theta$, that the "probability" of nullity
of $\Delta_p^\theta(\eta)$ with ${\mathcal L}^\theta \simeq \delta V_\theta$, $\delta \geq
1$, is about $\frac{O(1)}{p^{f \delta^2}}$, where $f$ is the residue degree of $p$ in the field of
values of the characters $\varphi \div \theta$ and that the $\Delta_p^\theta(\eta)$ are independent
variables. We conjecture that $p^{1-n} {\rm Reg}_p(K)$, which measures the order of the $p$-torsion
group in Abelian $p$-ramification over $K$, is for $p$ large enough a $p$-adic unit except perhaps
for an infinite set of prime numbers of zero density. For this set of $p$ said "with minimal splitting"
(i.e. a single $\Delta_p^\theta (\eta)$ is zero, and $\delta = f = 1$), it remains possible, $\eta$
being then a "partial local $p$th power" at $p$, to justify and to propose (in connection with the
$ABC$ conjecture) a stronger conjecture leading to the same conclusion (Section 7). Some other
conjectural aspects on the Fermat quotient are discussed. We precise and verify these properties
through numerical studies on particular cyclic cubic and quintic fields and a non-Abelian field
(group $D_6$), and we publish the corresponding "PARI" programs.
