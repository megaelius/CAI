It was conjectured, twenty years ago, the following result that would generalize the so-called
rank rigidity theorem for homogeneous Euclidean submanifolds: let M^n, n>=2, be a full and irreducible
homogeneous submanifold of the sphere $S^{N-1}\subset R^N$ and such that the normal holonomy group
is not transitive (on the unit sphere of the normal space to the sphere). Then M^n must be an orbit of
an irreducible s-representation (i.e. the isotropy representation of a semisimple Riemannian
symmetric space). If n=2, then the normal holonomy is always transitive, unless M is a homogeneous
isoparametric hypersurface of the sphere (and so the conjecture is true in this case). We prove the
conjecture when n=3. In this case M^3 must be either isoparametric or a Veronese submanifold. The
proof combines geometric arguments with (delicate) topological arguments that uses information
from two different fibrations with the same total space (the holonomy tube and the caustic fibrations).
We also prove the conjecture for n>= 3 when the normal holonomy acts irreducibly and the codimension
is the maximal possible n(n+1)/2. This gives a characterization of Veronese submanifolds in terms
of normal holonomy. We also extend this last result by replacing the homogeneity assumption by the
assumption of minimality (in the sphere). Another result of the paper, used for the case n=3, is that
the number of irreducible factors of the local normal holonomy group, for any Euclidean submanifold
M^n, is less or equal than [n/2] (which is the rank of the orthogonal group SO(n)). This bound is sharp
and improves the known bound n(n-1)/2.
