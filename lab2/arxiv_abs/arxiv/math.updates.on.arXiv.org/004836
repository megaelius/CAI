We consider the action of a finite subgroup of the orientation preserving mapping class group $Mod(S)$
of an oriented compact surface $S$ of genus $g \geq 2$ on the moduli space $\mathcal{R}(S,G)$ of representations
of $\pi_1(S)$ in a connected semisimple real Lie group $G$. Kerckhoff's solution of the Nielsen
realization problem ensures the existence of an element $J$ in the Teichm\"uller space of $S$ for
which $\Gamma$ can be realised as a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of $X=(S,J)$ which are
holomorphic or antiholomorphic. We identify the fixed points of the action of $\Gamma$ on $\mathcal{R}(S,G)$
in terms of $G$-Higgs bundles on $X$ equipped with a certain twisted $\Gamma$-equivariant structure,
where the twisting involves abelian and non-abelian group cohomology simultaneously. When the
kernel of the isotropy representation of the maximal compact subgroup of $G$ is trivial, the fixed
points can be described in terms of familiar objects on $Y=X/\Gamma^+$, where $\Gamma^+ \subset
\Gamma$ is the maximal subgroup of $\Gamma$ consisting of holomorphic automorphisms of $X$. If
$\Gamma=\Gamma^+$ one obtains actual $\Gamma$-equivariant $G$-Higgs bundles on $X$, which in
turn correspond with parabolic Higgs bundles on $Y=X/\Gamma$ (this generalizes work of Nasatyr
\& Steer for $G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ and Boden, Andersen & Grove and Furuta & Steer for $G=SU(n)$).
If on the other hand $\Gamma$ has antiholomorphic automorphisms, the objects on $Y=X/\Gamma^+$
correspond with pseudoreal parabolic Higgs bundles. This is a generalization in the parabolic
setup of the pseudoreal Higgs bundles studied by the first author in collaboration with Biswas &
Hurtubise.
