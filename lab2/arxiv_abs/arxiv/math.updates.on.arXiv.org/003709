Due to the heavy reliance of millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless systems on directional links, beamforming
(BF) with high-dimensional arrays is essential for cellular systems in these frequencies. How
to perform the array processing in a power efficient manner is a fundamental challenge. Analog and
hybrid BF require fewer analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs and DACs),
but can only communicate in a small number of directions at a time, limiting directional search,
spatial multiplexing and control signaling. Digital BF enables flexible spatial processing,
but must be operated at a low quantization resolution to stay within reasonable power levels. This
decrease in quantizer resolution introduces noise in the received signal and degrades the quality
of the transmitted signal. To assess the effect of low-resolution quantization on cellular system,
we present a simple additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model for quantization noise. Simulations
with this model reveal that at moderate resolutions (3-4 bits per ADC), there is negligible loss
in downlink cellular capacity from quantization. In essence, the low-resolution ADCs limit the
high SNR, where cellular systems typically do not operate. For the transmitter, it is shown that
DACs with 4 or more bits of resolution do not violate the adjacent carrier leakage limit set by 3-rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) New Radio (NR) standards for cellular operations. Further,
this work studies the effect of low resolution quantization on the error vector magnitude (EVM)
of the transmitted signal.In fact, our findings suggests that low-resolution fully digital BF
architectures can be a power efficient alternative to analog or hybrid beamforming for both transmitters
and receivers at millimeter wave.
