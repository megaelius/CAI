For which values of $n$ can we color the positive integers with precisely $n$ colors in such a way that
for any $a$, the numbers $a,2a,\dots,na$ all get different colors? Pach posed the question around
2008-9. Particular cases appeared in K\"oMaL in April 2010, and the general version appeared in
May 2010 on MathOverflow, posted by P\'alv\"olgyi. The question remains open. We discuss the known
partial results and investigate a series of related matters attempting to understand the structure
of these $n$-satisfactory colorings. Specifically, we show that there is an $n$-satisfactory
coloring whenever there is an abelian group operation $\oplus$ on the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ compatible
with multiplication in the sense that whenever $i$, $j$ and $ij$ are in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, then $ij=i\oplus
j$. This includes in particular the cases where $n+1$ is prime, or $2n+1$ is prime, or $n=p^2-p$ for
some prime $p$, or there is a $k$ such that $q=nk+1$ is prime and $1^k,\dots,n^k$ are all distinct
modulo $q$ (in which case we call $q$ a strong representative of order $n$). The colorings obtained
by this process we call multiplicative. We also show that nonmultiplicative colorings exist for
some values of $n$. There is an $n$-satisfactory coloring of $\mathbb Z^+$ if and only if there is
such a coloring of the set $K_n$ of $n$-smooth numbers. We identify all $n$-satisfactory colorings
for $n\le 5$ and all multiplicative colorings for $n\le 8$, and show that there are as many nonmultiplicative
colorings of $K_n$ as there are real numbers for $n=6$ and 8. We show that if $n$ admits a strong representative
$q$ then the set of such $q$ has positive natural density in the set of all primes. We show that the question
of whether there is an $n$-satisfactory coloring is equivalent to a problem about tilings, and use
this to give a geometric characterization of multiplicative colorings.
