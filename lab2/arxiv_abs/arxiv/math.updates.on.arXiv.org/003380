The spread of opinions, memes, diseases, and "alternative facts" in a population depends both on
the details of the spreading process and on the structure of the social and communication networks
on which they spread. In this paper, we explore how \textit{anti-establishment} nodes (e.g., \textit{hipsters})
influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products. We consider a model in which spreading
follows a deterministic rule for updating node states (which describe which product has been adopted)
in which an adjustable fraction $p_{\rm Hip}$ of the nodes in a network are hipsters, who choose to
adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the two. The remaining nodes are conformists,
who choose which product to adopt by considering which products their immediate neighbors have
adopted. We simulate our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters
have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product: even when only one of the
two products exists at the beginning of the simulations, a very small fraction of hipsters in a network
can still cause the other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this behavior,
we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fraction on $k$-regular trees in the
limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that a time delay $\tau$ in the
knowledge of the product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of product
adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final distribution of product adoptions.
Our simple model and analysis may help shed light on the road to success for anti-establishment choices
in elections, as such success can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of anti-establishment
individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on normal individuals.
