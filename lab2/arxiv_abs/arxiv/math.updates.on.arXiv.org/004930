In this work, a diffusive eco-epidemiological model where the predator's population consume their
species to survive. The proposed model is studied from both points of view, theoretical and numerical.
Firstly, we deal with the behaviour of the constant positive steady state then nonconstant positive
steady state. Sufficient conditions for local asymptotic stability and global asymptotic stability
for a constant positive steady state are derived by linearization and Lyapunov function technique.
Prior estimates of the positive steady state given, conditions are obtained for the non-existence
of non-constant positive solution, by Cauchy and Poincar\'e inequality. The existence of non-constant
positive steady states is studied by Leray-Schauder degree theory. These results indicate the
importance of the large diffusivity which is responsible for the appearance and non-appearance
of stationary patterns. We have discussed Turing instability, which ensures the existence of Turing
patterns. Further, the effect of the cannibalistic attack rate and disease transmission rate observed
on the dynamics of the proposed model system. Even it followed that in the absence of cannibalism,
the spatial distribution is not possible and increment in the cannibalistic attack rate and disease
transmission rate promote the Turing patterns. The similar effect observed for the disease transmission
rate. Further, we have calculated Lyapunov exponents and saw the chaotic and stable fixed dynamics
for various parameter settings. In the last, we have performed extensive numerical simulation
and obtained Turing and spatiotemporal patterns.
