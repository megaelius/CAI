In the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication systems, the acquisition
of channel state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for achieving the passive beamforming
gain of IRS because of the considerable overhead required for channel estimation. Specifically,
under the current beamforming design for IRS-assisted communications, $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients
should be estimated if the passive IRS cannot estimate its channels with the base station (BS) and
users due to its lack of radio frequency (RF) chains, where $K$, $N$ and $M$ denote the number of users,
reflecting elements of the IRS, and antennas at the BS, respectively. This number can be extremely
large in practice considering the current trend of massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output),
i.e., a large $M$, and massive connectivity, i.e., a large $K$. To accurately estimate such a large
number of channel coefficients within a short time interval, we devote our endeavour in this paper
to investigating the efficient pilot-based channel estimation method in IRS-assisted uplink
communications. Building upon the observation that the IRS reflects the signals from all the users
to the BS via the same channels, we analytically verify that a time duration consisting of $K+N+\max(K-1,\lceil
(K-1)N/M \rceil)$ pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS to perfectly recover all the $KMN+KM$ channel
coefficients in the case without noise. In contrast to the conventional uplink communications
without IRS in which the minimum pilot sequence length for channel estimation is independent with
the number of receive antennas, our study reveals the significant role of massive MIMO in reducing
the channel training time for IRS-assisted communication systems.
