The paper is devoted to an analysis of optimality conditions for nonsmooth multidimensional problems
of the calculus of variations with various types of constraints, such as additional constraints
at the boundary, isoperimetric constraints, and nonholonomic inequality constraints. To derive
optimality conditions, we study generalised concepts of differentiability of nonsmooth functions
called codifferentiability and quasidifferentiability. Under some natural and easily verifiable
assumptions we prove that a nonsmooth integral functional defined on the Sobolev space is continuously
codifferentiable and compute its codifferential and quasidifferential. Then we apply general
optimality conditions for nonsmooth optimisation problems in Banach spaces to obtain optimality
conditions for nonsmooth problems of the calculus of variations. Through a series of simple examples
we demonstrate that our optimality conditions are sometimes better than existing ones in terms
of various subdifferentials, in the sense that our optimality conditions can detect the non-optimality
of a given point when subdifferential-based optimality conditions fail to disqualify this point
as non-optimal. Apart from standard optimality conditions, we also study so-called inner variations
of nonsmooth integral functionals and utilise them to extend the Noether equations for variational
problems to a nonsmooth setting. With the use of these equations we obtain a nonsmooth law of conservation
of energy for autonomous nonsmooth variational problems. Finally, we discuss some difficulties
one faces when trying to extend famous Noether's theorem on symmetries and conservation laws to
a nonsmooth case.
