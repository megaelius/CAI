In this paper we are concerned with resolvent estimates for the Laplacian $\Delta$ in Euclidean
spaces. Uniform resolvent estimates for $\Delta$ were shown by Kenig, Ruiz and Sogge \cite{KRS}
who established rather a complete description of the Lebesgue spaces allowing such uniform resolvent
estimate. The estimates have a variety of applications, particularly, to proving uniform Sobolev
and Carleman estimates. Recently, interest in such estimates was renewed in connection to the Carleman
estimate related to inverse problems. Especially, on a compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, an
interesting new phenomenon was discovered by Dos Santos Ferreira, Kenig and Salo \cite{DKS}. Precisely,
the estimate \[ \| (-\Delta_g-z)^{-1}f \|_{L^\frac{2d}{d-2}(M)}\le C\| f\|_{L^\frac{2d}{d+2}(M)}
\] holds with $C$ independent of $z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus[0,\infty)$ when $\mathop{\mathrm{Im}}\sqrt{z}\ge
\delta$ for $\delta>0$. Later it was shown by Bourgain, Shao, Sogge and Yao \cite{BSSY} that the
region of $z$ can not be extended to a wider range in general, and under the same assumption on the range
of $z$, the range of $p,q$ was further extended by Shao and Yao \cite{SY}. However, even in the Euclidean
spaces, the problem of obtaining sharp $L^p$-$L^q$ bounds depending on $z$ has not been considered
in general framework which admits all possible $p,q$. In this paper, we present a complete picture
of sharp $L^p$-$L^q$ resolvent estimates, which may depend on $z$. The resolvent estimates in Euclidean
space seem to be expected to behave in a simpler way compared with those on manifolds. However, it
turns out that, for some $p,q$, the estimates exhibit unexpected behavior which is similar to those
on compact Riemannian manifolds. We also obtain the non-uniform sharp resolvent estimates for
the fractional Laplacians and a new result for the Bochner-Riesz operators of negative index.
