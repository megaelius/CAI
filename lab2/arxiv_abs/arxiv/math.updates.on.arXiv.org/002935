We study minimizers of a family of functionals $E_\varepsilon$ indexed by a characteristic length
scale $\varepsilon$, whose formal limit is $E_\star(u)=\int W(\nabla u)$ for $u$ taking values
into a manifold, where $W$ is a positive definite quadratic form: minimizers of $E_\star$ are $W$-harmonic
maps -- classical harmonic maps correspond to the isotropic case $W(\nabla u)=\vert\nabla u\vert^2$.
We show that the convergence of minimizers of $E_\varepsilon$ to $W$-harmonic maps is locally uniform
outside a singular set. We treat general energies, covering in particular the 3D Landau-de Gennes
model for liquid crystals, with three distinct elastic constants. In the isotropic case, similar
results are standard and rely on three ingredients: a monotonicity formula for the scale-invariant
energy on small balls, a uniform pointwise bound, and a Bochner equation for the energy density.
In the level of generality we consider in this work, all of these ingredients are absent and we have
to use a very different strategy. Finding ways around the lack of monotonicity formula is particularly
interesting, since this issue is why optimal estimates on the singular set of $W$-harmonic maps
constitute an open problem. Our novel argument relies on showing appropriate decay for the energy
on small balls, separately at scales smaller and larger than $\varepsilon$: the former is obtained
from the regularity of solutions to elliptic systems while the latter is inherited from the regularity
of $W$-harmonic maps. This also allows us to handle physically relevant boundary conditions for
which, even in the isotropic case, uniform convergence up to the boundary was open.
