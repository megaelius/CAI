e-Valuate is a game on arithmetic expressions. The players have contrasting roles of maximizing
and minimizing the given expression. The maximizer proposes values and the minimizer substitutes
them for variables of his choice. When the expression is fully instantiated, its value is compared
with a certain minimax value that would result if the players played to their optimal strategies.
The winner is declared based on this comparison. We use a game tree to represent the state of the game
and show how the minimax value can be computed efficiently using backward induction and alpha-beta
pruning. The efficacy of alpha-beta pruning depends on the order in which the nodes are evaluated.
Further improvements can be obtained by using transposition tables to prevent reevaluation of
the same nodes. We propose a heuristic for node ordering. We show how the use of the heuristic and transposition
tables lead to improved performance by comparing the number of nodes pruned by each method. We describe
some domain-specific variants of this game. The first is a graph theoretic formulation wherein
two players share a set of elements of a graph by coloring a related set with each player looking to
maximize his share. The set being shared could be either the set of vertices, edges or faces (for a
planar graph). An application of this is the sharing of regions enclosed by a planar graph where each
player's aim is to maximize the area of his share. Another variant is a tiling game where the players
alternately place dominoes on a $8 \times 8$ checkerboard to construct a maximal partial tiling.
We show that the size of the tiling $x$ satisfies $22 \le x \le 32$ by proving that any maximal partial
tiling requires at least $22$ dominoes.
