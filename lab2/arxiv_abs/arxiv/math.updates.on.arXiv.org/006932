It is declared that the aim of simplifying representations of coefficients of power series of classical
statistical mechanics is to simplify a process of obtaining estimates of the coefficients using
their simplified representations. The aim of the article is: to formulate criteria for the complexity
(from the above point of view) of representations of coefficients of the power series of classical
statistical mechanics and to demonstrate their application by examples of comparing the Ree-Hoover
representations of virial coefficients (briefly -- the RH representations) with such representations
of power series coefficients that are based on the conception of the frame classification of labeled
graphs (the abbreviation -- FC). To solve these problems, mathematical notions were introduced
(such as a basic product, a basic integral, a basic linear combination, a basic linear combination
with coefficients of insignificant complexity(the abbreviation -- BLC with CIC) and the classification
of representations of the coefficients of power series of classical statistical mechanics is proposed.
In the classification, the class of BLC's with CIC is the most important. It includes all the above
representations of the coefficients of power series of classical statistical mechanics. Three
criteria are formulated for estimate the comparative complexity of BLC's with CIC. These criteria
are ordered by their accuracy. Based on each of these criteria, a criterion for the comparative complexity
of finite sets of BLC's with CIC is constructed. The constructed criteria are ordered by their accuracy.
The application of all the constructed criteria is demonstrated by examples of comparing RH representations
with the representations of the power series coefficients based on the concept FC. The obtained
results are presented in the tables and commented.
