This paper is concerned with a two-fold objective. Firstly, we establish elicitability and identifiability
results for systemic risk measures introduced in Feinstein, Rudloff and Weber (2017). Specifying
the entire set of capital allocations adequate to render a financial system acceptable, these systemic
risk measures are examples of set-valued functionals. A functional is elicitable (identifiable)
if it is the unique minimiser (zero) of an expected scoring function (identification function).
Elicitability and identifiability are essential for forecast ranking and validation, $M$- and
$Z$-estimation, both possibly in a regression framework. To account for the set-valued nature
of the systemic risk measures mentioned above, we secondly introduce a theoretical framework of
elicitability and identifiability of set-valued functionals. It distinguishes between exhaustive
forecasts, being set-valued and aiming at correctly specifying the entire functional, and selective
forecasts, content with solely specifying a single point in the correct functional. Uncovering
the structural relation between the two corresponding notions of elicitability and identifiability,
we establish that a set-valued functional can be either selectively elicitable or exhaustively
elicitable. Notably, selections of quantiles such as the lower quantile turn out not to be elicitable
in general. Applying these structural results to systemic risk measures, we construct oriented
selective identification functions, which induce a family of strictly consistent exhaustive
elementary scoring functions. We discuss equivariance properties of these scores. We demonstrate
their applicability in a simulation study considering comparative backtests of Diebold-Mariano
type with a pointwise traffic-light illustration of Murphy diagrams.
