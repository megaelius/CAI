We study the propagation of sound waves in a three-dimensional, infinite ambient flow with weak
random fluctuations of the mean particle velocity and speed of sound. We more particularly address
the regime where the acoustic wavelengths are comparable to the correlation lengths of the weak
inhomogeneities--the so-called weak coupling limit. The analysis is carried on starting from
the linearized Euler equations and the convected wave equation with variable density and speed
of sound, which can be derived from the nonlinear Euler equations. We use a multi-scale expansion
of the Wigner distribution of a velocity potential associated to the waves to derive a radiative
transfer equation describing the evolution of the angularly resolved wave action in space/time
phase space. The latter experiences convection, refraction and scattering when it propagates
through the heterogeneous ambient flow, although the overall wave action is conserved. The convection
and refraction phenomena are accounted for by the convective part of the transport equation and
depend on the smooth variations of the ambient quantities. The scattering phenomenon is accounted
for by the collisional part of the transport equation and depends on the cross-power spectral densities
of the fluctuations of the ambient quantities at the wavelength scales. The refraction, phase shift,
spectral broadening, and multiple scattering effects of the high-frequency regimes described
in various previous publications are thus encompassed by the proposed model. The overall derivation
is based on the interpretation of spatial-temporal Wigner transforms in terms of semiclassical
operators, along the same lines as Bal [Wave Motion 43, 132-157 (2005)] and Baydoun et al. [Wave Motion
51, 1325-1348 (2014)].
