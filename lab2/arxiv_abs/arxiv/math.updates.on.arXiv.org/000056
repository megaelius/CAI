Let K be a complete and algebraically closed field with value group \Lambda and residue field k, and
let \phi : X' \to X be a finite morphism of smooth, proper, irreducible, stable marked algebraic curves
over K. We show that \phi gives rise in a canonical way to a finite and effective harmonic morphism
of \Lambda-metric graphs, and more generally to a finite harmonic morphism of \Lambda-metrized
complexes of k-curves. Our arguments give analytic proofs of stronger "skeletonized" versions
of some foundational results of Liu-Lorenzini, Coleman, and Liu on simultaneous semistable reduction
of curves. We then consider the inverse problem of lifting finite harmonic morphisms of metric graphs/tropical
curves and metrized complexes to morphisms of curves over K. We prove that every tamely ramified
finite harmonic morphism of \Lambda-metrized complexes of k-curves lifts to a finite morphism
of K-curves. If in addition the ramification points are marked, we obtain a complete classification
of all such lifts along with their automorphisms. This generalizes and provides new analytic proofs
of earlier results of Sa\"idi and Wewers. We also give various applications of these results. For
example, we show that linear equivalence of divisors on a tropical curve C coincides with the equivalence
relation generated by declaring that the fibers of every finite harmonic morphism from C to the tropical
projective line are equivalent. We study liftability of metrized complexes equipped with a finite
group action, and as an application classify all (augmented) metric graphs arising as the tropicalization
of a hyperelliptic curve. We also discuss the relationship between harmonic morphisms of metric
graphs and induced maps between component groups of N\'eron models, providing a negative answer
to a question of Ribet motivated by number theory.
