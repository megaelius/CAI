Hamiltonian trajectories are strictly time-reversible. Any time series of Hamiltonian coordinates
{q} satisfying Hamilton's motion equations will likewise satisfy them when played "backwards",
with the corresponding momenta changing signs : {+p} --> {-p}. Here we adopt Levesque and Verlet's
precisely bit-reversible motion algorithm to ensure that the trajectory reversibility is exact,
with the forward and backward sets of coordinates identical. Nevertheless, the associated instantaneous
Lyapunov instability, or "sensitive dependence on initial conditions" of "chaotic" (or "Lyapunov
unstable") bit-reversible coordinate trajectories can still exhibit an exponentially growing
time-symmetry-breaking irreversibility. Surprisingly, the positive and negative exponents,
as well as the forward and backward Lyapunov spectra, are usually not closely related, and so give
four differing topological measures of "local" chaos. We have demonstrated this symmetry breaking
for fluid shockwaves, for free expansions, and for chaotic molecular collisions. Here we illustrate
and discuss this time-symmetry breaking for three statistical-mechanical systems, [1] a minimal
(but still chaotic) one-body "cell model" with a four-dimensional phase space; [2] relatively
small colliding crystallites, for which the whole Lyapunov spectrum is accessible; [3] a near-continuum
inelastic collision of two larger 400-particle balls. In the last two of these pedagogical problems
the two colliding bodies coalesce. The particles most prone to Lyapunov instability are dramatically
different in the two time directions. Thus this Lyapunov-based symmetry breaking furnishes an
interesting Arrow of Time.
