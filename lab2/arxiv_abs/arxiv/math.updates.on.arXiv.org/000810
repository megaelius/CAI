We study the Allen-Cahn equation with a cubic-quintic nonlinear term and a stochastic $Q$-trace-class
stochastic forcing in two spatial dimensions. This stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE) is used as a test case to understand, how numerical continuation methods can be carried over
to the SPDE setting. First, we compute the deterministic bifurcation diagram for the PDE, {i.e.}~without
stochastic forcing. In this case, two locally asymptotically stable steady state solution branches
exist upon variation of the linear damping term. Then we consider the Lyapunov operator equation
for the locally linearized system around steady states for the SPDE. We discretize the full SPDE
using a combination of finite-differences and spectral noise approximation obtaining a finite-dimensional
system of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs). The large system of SODEs is used
to approximate the Lyapunov operator equation via covariance matrices. The covariance matrices
are numerically continued along the two bifurcation branches. We show that we can quantify the stochastic
fluctuations along the branches. We also demonstrate scaling laws near branch and fold bifurcation
points. Furthermore, we perform computational tests to show that, even with a sub-optimal computational
setup, we can quantify the subexponential-timescale fluctuations near the deterministic steady
states upon stochastic forcing on a standard desktop computer setup. Hence, the proposed method
for numerical continuation of SPDEs has the potential to allow for rapid parametric uncertainty
quantification of spatio-temporal stochastic systems.
