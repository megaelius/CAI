What is the probability that the number of triangles in $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$, the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graph with edge density $p$, is at least twice its mean? Writing it as $\exp[- r(n,p)]$, already
the order of the rate function $r(n,p)$ was a longstanding open problem when $p=o(1)$, finally settled
in 2012 by Chatterjee and by DeMarco and Kahn, who independently showed that $r(n,p)\asymp n^2p^2
\log (1/p)$ for $p \gtrsim \frac{\log n}n$; the exact asymptotics of $r(n,p)$ remained unknown.
The following variational problem can be related to this large deviation question at $p\gtrsim
\frac{\log n}n$: for $\delta>0$ fixed, what is the minimum asymptotic $p$-relative entropy
of a weighted graph on $n$ vertices with triangle density at least $(1+\delta)p^3$? A beautiful
large deviation framework of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011) reduces upper tails for triangles
to a limiting version of this problem for fixed $p$. A very recent breakthrough of Chatterjee and
Dembo extended its validity to $n^{-\alpha}\ll p \ll 1$ for an explicit $\alpha>0$, and plausibly
it holds in all of the above sparse regime. In this note we show that the solution to the variational
problem is $\min\{\frac12 \delta^{2/3}\,,\, \frac13 \delta\}$ when $n^{-1/2}\ll p \ll 1$ vs.
$\frac12 \delta^{2/3}$ when $n^{-1} \ll p\ll n^{-1/2}$ (the transition between these regimes
is expressed in the count of triangles minus an edge in the minimizer). From the results of Chatterjee
and Dembo, this shows for instance that the probability that $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ for $ n^{-\alpha}
\leq p \ll 1$ has twice as many triangles as its expectation is $\exp[-r(n,p)]$ where $r(n,p)\sim
\frac13 n^2 p^2\log(1/p)$.
