RMSProp and ADAM continue to be extremely popular algorithms for training neural nets but their
theoretical convergence properties have remained unclear. Further, recent work has seemed to
suggest that these algorithms have worse generalization properties when compared to carefully
tuned stochastic gradient descent or its momentum variants. In this work, we make progress towards
a deeper understanding of ADAM and RMSProp in two ways. First, we provide proofs that these adaptive
gradient algorithms are guaranteed to reach criticality for smooth non-convex objectives, and
we give bounds on the running time. Next we design experiments to empirically study the convergence
and generalization properties of RMSProp and ADAM against Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient method
on a variety of common autoencoder setups and on VGG-9 with CIFAR-10. Through these experiments
we demonstrate the interesting sensitivity that ADAM has to its momentum parameter $\beta_1$.
We show that at very high values of the momentum parameter ($\beta_1 = 0.99$) ADAM outperforms a carefully
tuned NAG on most of our experiments, in terms of getting lower training and test losses. On the other
hand, NAG can sometimes do better when ADAM's $\beta_1$ is set to the most commonly used value: $\beta_1
= 0.9$, indicating the importance of tuning the hyperparameters of ADAM to get better generalization
performance. We also report experiments on different autoencoders to demonstrate that NAG has
better abilities in terms of reducing the gradient norms, and it also produces iterates which exhibit
an increasing trend for the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss function at the iterates.
