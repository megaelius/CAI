This is the first in a series of three notes on an investigation into core regular double Stone algebras,
CRDSA, and are meant to be read in order. In [2] many useful results regarding the center and core of
a CRDSA that indicate the "nearly Boolean" nature of CRDSA and we extend that concept here. These
notes were born out of a model of network security where individual nodes are considered to be in one
and only one of 3 states, e.g. ternary set partitions. Applications of these results are being explored,
results of at least one of which will be published at a later date. Let J be any non-empty set of network
nodes, not necessarily finite. We denote the node set bounded distributive lattice through the
pairwise disjoint subsets of J with the well known binary operations of ternary set partitions and
note J = 1 is our minimal case. We then show the resultant bounded distributive lattice is isomorphic
to direct products of the 3 element chain, C_3. We then derive that every CRDSA is a subdirect product
of C_3, similarly to Boolean algebras and C_2. We use these results along with a few known results
to show the main result, namely every Boolean algebra is the center of some core regular double Stone
algebra, CRDSA. We then use that result to characterize all subalgebras of finite core regular double
Stone Algebras, namely a CRDSA A is a subalgebra of C_3^J for some finite J if and only if it is isomorphic
to C_3^K for some K less than or equal to J. Lastly, we show that C_3 is primal, which implies that the
variety generated by it is dually equivalent to the category of Stone spaces and hence the category
of Boolean algebras. The following two notes establish a bi-topological duality further exhibiting
the "nearly Boolean" nature of CRDSA.
