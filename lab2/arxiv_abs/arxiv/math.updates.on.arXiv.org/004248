Let $(X,h)$ be a compact and irreducible Hermitian complex space. This paper is devoted to various
questions concerning the analytic K-homology of $(X,h)$. In the fist part, assuming either $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$
or $\mathrm{dim}(X)=2$, we show that the rolled-up operator of the minimal $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$
complex, denoted here $\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{rel}}$, induces a class in $K_0 (X)\equiv KK_0(C(X),\mathbb{C})$.
A similar result, assuming $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$, is proved also for $\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{abs}}$,
the rolled-up operator of the maximal $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex. We then show that
when $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$ we have $[\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{rel}}]=\pi_*[\overline{\eth}_M]$
with $\pi:M\rightarrow X$ an arbitrary resolution and with $[\overline{\eth}_M]\in K_0 (M)$
the analytic K-homology class induced by $\overline{\partial}+\overline{\partial}^t$ on $M$.
In the second part of the paper we focus on complex projective varieties $(V,h)$ endowed with the
Fubini-Study metric. First, assuming $\dim(V)\leq 2$, we compare the Baum-Fulton-MacPherson
K-homology class of $V$ with the class defined analytically through the rolled-up operator of any
$L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex. We show that there is no $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$
complex on $(\mathrm{reg}(V),h)$ whose rolled-up operator induces a K-homology class that equals
the Baum-Fulton-MacPherson class. Finally in the last part of the paper we prove that under suitable
assumptions on $V$ the push-forward of $[\overline{\eth}_{\mathrm{rel}}]$ in the K-homology
of the classifying space of the fundamental group of $V$ is a birational invariant.
