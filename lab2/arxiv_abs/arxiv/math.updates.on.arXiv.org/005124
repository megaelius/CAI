The notion of network connectivity is used to characterize the robustness and failure tolerance
of networks, with high connectivity being a desirable feature. In this paper, we develop a novel
approach to the problem of identifying critical nodes in large-scale networks, with algebraic
connectivity (the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian) as the chosen metric. Employing
a graph-embedding technique, we reduce the class of considered weight-balanced graphs to spatial
networks with uniformly distributed nodes and nearest-neighbors communication topologies.
Through a continuum approximation, we consider the Laplace operator on a manifold (with the Neumann
boundary condition) as the limiting case of the graph Laplacian. We then reduce the critical node
set identification problem to that of finding a ball of fixed radius, whose removal minimizes the
second (Neumann) eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on the residual domain. This leads us to consider
two functional and nested optimization problems. Resorting to the min-max theorem, we first treat
the problem of determining the second smallest eigenvalue for a fixed domain by minimizing an energy
functional. We then obtain a projected gradient flow that converges to the set of points satisfying
the KKT conditions and prove that the only locally asymptotically stable critical point is the second
eigenfunction of the Laplace operator. Building on these results, we consider the critical ball
identification problem and construct a dynamics to converge asymptotically to these points. Finally,
we provide a characterization of the location of critical nodes (for infinitesimally-small balls)
as those points which belong to the nodal set of the second eigenfunction of the Laplace operator.
