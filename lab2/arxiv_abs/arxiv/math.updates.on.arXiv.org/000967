We continue the work of a series of previous studies of a mathematical model that describes the mean-field
limit behavior of a homogeneous network of excitatory point spiking neurons. Contrary to other
models, here noise is intrinsic to the neurons through a membrane-potential dependent spiking
rate probability, that we assume to be given by a power law. This allows one to collapse several sources
of neural noise into a single function, which aids for a more treatable mathematical and comptuational
analysis. In particular, we give pseudo-analytical expressions for the invariant distributions
of membrane potentials across the population and study their stability computationally. The neurons
are assumed to be connected both by chemical and possibly electrical (gap junction) synapses and
can also undergo a leakage of ions with the extracellular medium. The distributions are of compact
support whenever leakage or gap junction rates are non-zero and an infinite discontinuity appears
at the maximum potential in the population. This happens invariably for the leakage (with no gap
junctions) and gap junction (without leakage) cases. However, these discontinuous distributions
might only be stable for linear spiking rate functions. It was recently shown how the network can
present highly synchronous states of global oscillations in its activity when leakage is not present
and gap junctions are strong enough. Here we confirm how oscillations persist also when weak leakage
is considered. Thus, these dendritic (rather than axonal) gap junctions could play a role in the
high levels of neural synchrony necessary for the development of neural systems at young ages. The
model, thus, presents a rich phenomenology and capability to reproduce several biological features
of neural networks despite of its mathematical simplicity, hence presenting a powerful tool for
high performance computing.
