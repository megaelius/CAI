Quantum theory (QT), namely in terms of Schr\"odinger's 1926 wave functions in general requires
complex numbers to be formulated. However, it soon turned out to even require some hypercomplex
algebra. Incorporating Special Relativity leads to an equation (Dirac 1928) requiring pairwise
anti-commuting coefficients, usually $4\times 4$ matrices. A unitary ring of square matrices
is an associative hypercomplex algebra by definition. Since only the algebraic properties and
relations of the elements matter, we replace the matrices by biquaternions. In this paper, we first
consider the basics of non-relativistic and relativistic QT. Then we introduce general hypercomplex
algebras and also show how a relativistic quantum equation like Dirac's one can be formulated using
biquaternions. Subsequently, some algebraic preconditions for operations within hypercomplex
algebras and their subalgebras will be examined. For our purpose equations akin to Schr\"odinger's
should be able to be set up and solved. Functions of complementary variables should be Fourier transforms
of each other. This should hold within a purely non-real subspace which must hence be a subalgebra.
Furthermore, it is an ideal denoted by $\mathcal{J}$. It must be isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, hence
containing an internal identity element. The bicomplex numbers will turn out to fulfil these preconditions,
and therefore, the formalism of QT can be developed within its subalgebras. We also show that bicomplex
numbers encourage the definition of several different kinds of conjugates. One of these treats
the elements of $\mathcal{J}$ like the usual conjugate treats complex numbers. This defines a quantity
what we call a modulus which, in contrast to the complex absolute square, remains non-real (but may
be called `pseudo-real'). However, we do not conduct an explicit physical interpretation here
but we leave this to future examinations.
