We present a re-parameterization of vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models that
allows estimation of parameters under the constraints of causality and invertibility. The parameter
constraints associated with a causal invertible VARMA model are highly complex. Currently there
are no procedures that can maintain the constraints in the estimated VARMA process, except in the
special case of a vector autoregression (VAR), where some moment based causal estimators are available.
Even in the VAR case, the available likelihood based estimators are not causal. The maximum likelihood
estimator based on the full likelihood that does not condition on the initial observations by definition
satisfies the causal invertible constraints but optimization of the likelihood under the complex
constraints is an intractable problem. The commonly used Bayesian procedure for VAR often has posterior
mass outside the causal set because the priors are not constrained to the causal set of parameters.
We provide an exact mathematical solution to this problem. An $m$-variate VARMA$(p, q)$ process
contains $(p+ q) m^2 + \binom{m+1}{2}$ parameters, which must be constrained to a subset of Euclidean
space in order to guarantee causality and invertibility. This space is implicitly described in
this paper, through the device of parameterizing the entire space of block Toeplitz matrices in
terms of positive definite matrices and orthogonal matrices. The parameterization has connection
to Schur- stability of polynomials and the associated Stein transformation that are often used
in dynamical systems literature. As an important by-product of our investigation, we generalize
a classical result in dynamical systems to provide a characterization of Schur stable matrix polynomials.
