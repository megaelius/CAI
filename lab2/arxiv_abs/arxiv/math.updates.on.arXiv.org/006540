Mathematical models are traditionally used to analyze the long-term global evolution of epidemics,
to determine the potential and severity of an outbreak, and to provide critical information for
identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. One of the widely used mathematical
models of long-term spreading of epidemics are the so-called deterministic compartmental models
(SIR/SEIR type models). One of the main purposes of applying such models is to assess how the expensive
restriction measures imposed by the authorities (home and social isolation/quarantine, travel
restrictions, etc.) can effectively reduce the control reproduction number of the disease and
its transmission risk. However the classical SIR/SEIR models have been primarily studied in what
may be called stationary case, where the main parameters, the Transmission rate Beta (reflecting
the virus spread by infected individuals) and the Removed rate Gamma (reflecting the hospitalization/isolation
measures) remain constant during the whole period of interest. Hence, it is important to extend
the classical SIR/SEIR models by creating new ansatzes for the dynamics of the transmission rates
Beta(t) (which we will call further just Beta) and removed rates Gamma(t) (which we will call further
just Gamma). The main purpose of the present research is to introduce a spline-based SEIR model with
Time-varying Beta and Gamma parameters, or abbreviated TVBG-SEIR model, which is used to estimate
the practical implications of the public health interventions and measures. We have designed a
Tool based on the TVBG-SEIR model, which may be used as a Decision Support Tool to assist the health
decision- and policy-makers in creating predictive scenarios.
