We present a robust immersed boundary (IB) method for high density ratio multiphase flows that is
capable of modeling complex wave-structure interaction (WSI) problems arising in marine and coastal
engineering applications. The IB/WSI methodology is enabled by combining the distributed Lagrange
multiplier (DLM) method of Sharma and Patankar (J Comp Phys, 2005) with a robust level set method
based multiphase flow solver. The fluid solver integrates the conservative form of the variable-coefficient
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a hybrid preconditioner and ensures consistent
transport of mass and momentum at a discrete level. The consistent transport scheme preserves the
numerical stability of the method in the presence of large density ratios found in problems involving
air, water, and an immersed structure. The air-water interface is captured by the level set method
on an Eulerian grid, whereas the free-surface piercing immersed structure is represented on a Lagrangian
mesh. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) coupling is mediated via Peskin's regularized delta
functions in an implicit manner, which obviates the need to integrate the hydrodynamic stress tensor
on the complex surface of the immersed structure. The IB/WSI numerical scheme is implemented within
an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, in which the Lagrangian structure and the air-water
interface are embedded on the finest mesh level to capture the thin boundary layers and the vortical
structures arising from WSI. We use a well-balanced force discretization for gravity force that
eliminates spurious velocity currents in the hydrostatic limit due to density variation in the
three phases (air, water and solid). An effective wave generation and absorption technique for
a numerical wave tank is presented and used to simulate a benchmark case of water wave distortion
due to a submerged structure.
