Quantum homogeneous spaces are noncommutative spaces with quantum group covariance. Their semiclassical
counterparts are Poisson homogeneous spaces, which are quotient manifolds of Lie groups $M=G/H$
equipped with an additional Poisson structure $\pi$ which is compatible with a Poisson-Lie structure
$\Pi$ on $G$. Since the infinitesimal version of $\Pi$ defines a unique Lie bialgebra structure
$\delta$ on the Lie algebra $\frak g=\mbox{Lie}(G)$, we exploit the idea of Lie bialgebra duality
in order to introduce the notion of dual homogeneous space $M^\ast$ of a given homogeneous space
$M=G/H$ with respect to the Lie bialgebra $\delta$. Then, by considering the natural notions of
reductive and symmetric homogeneous spaces, we extend these concepts to $M^\ast$ thus showing
that an even richer duality framework between $M$ and $M^\ast$ arises. In order to analyse the physical
implications of this new duality, the case of $M$ being a Minkowski or (Anti-) de Sitter Poisson homogeneous
spacetime is fully studied, and the corresponding dual reductive and symmetric spaces $M^\ast$
are explicitly constructed in the case of the well-known $\kappa$-deformation, where the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ is introduced as an explicit parameter in order to describe all Lorentzian spaces
simultaneously. In particular, the fact that $M^\ast$ is reductive is shown to provide a natural
condition for the representation theory of the quantum analogue of $M$ that ensures the existence
of physically meaningful uncertainty relations between the noncommutative spacetime coordinates.
Finally we show that, despite the dual spaces $M^\ast$ are not endowed in general with a $G^\ast$-invariant
metric, their geometry can be described by making use of $K$-structures.
