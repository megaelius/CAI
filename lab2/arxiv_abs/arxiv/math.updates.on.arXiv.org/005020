In this paper, using stochastic geometry tools, we develop a systematic framework to characterize
the meta distributions of the downlink signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR)/signal-to-noise-ratio
(SNR) and data rate of a typical device in a Internet of Things (IoT) cellular network with coexisting
sub-6GHz and millimeter wave (mm-wave) spectrums. Macro base-stations (MBSs) transmit on sub-6GHz
channels (which we term ``microwave'' channels), whereas small base-stations (SBSs) communicate
with devices on mm-wave channels. The SBSs are connected to MBSs via a microwave ($\mu$wave) wireless
backhaul. The $\mu$wave channels are interference limited and mm-wave channels are noise limited;
therefore, we have the meta-distribution of SIR and SNR in microwave and mm-wave channels, respectively.
To model the line-of-sight (LOS) nature of mm-wave channels, we use Nakagami-m fading model. To
derive the meta-distribution of SIR/SNR, we characterize the conditional success probability
(CSP) (or equivalently reliability) and its $b^{\mathrm{th}}$ moment for a typical device (a)
when it associates to a $\mu$wave MBS for {\em direct} transmission, and (b) when it associates to
a mm-wave SBS for dual-hop transmission (backhaul and access transmission). Performance metrics
such as the mean and variance of the local delay (network jitter), mean of the CSP (coverage probability),
and variance of the CSP are derived. Closed-form expressions are presented for special scenarios.
The extensions of the developed framework to the $\mu$wave-only IoT network or IoT networks where
SBSs have mm-wave backhauls are discussed. Numerical results validate the analytical results.
Insights are extracted related to the reliability, coverage probability, and latency of the considered
network.
