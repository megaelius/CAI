This paper analyzes the existence of regularizations of integrals that apply to functions with
a nonintegrable singularity at an endpoint of integration. This is a problem arising naturally
in many contexts including solution of PDEs and singular ODEs. Regularizations, such as the classical
Hadamard finite part ($p.f.$), share two fundamental properties: (i) the regularized integral
of a function on an interval only depends on the values of the function in that interval, and of course,
(ii) the regularized integral is an antiderivative. Sufficient conditions for existence of regularizations
are well known, and they require various types of smoothness. The following is a natural apparently
open question: do regularizations exist beyond their known domain? We show that there exist regularizations
of integrals satisfying the properties of $p.f.$ which apply to singular functions without any
conditions on the type or strength of the singularity. However, the very existence of a regularization
beyond $p.f.$ satisfying only (i) and (ii) is independent of ZF (the usual ZFC axioms for mathematics
without the Axiom of Choice AC), and even of ZFDC (ZF with the Axiom of Dependent Choice). This is established
in \S 7.2, where we also show that such extensions cannot be naturally given - even if we are using the
full axiom of choice. In particular, we show that there is no mathematical description that can be
proved (within ZFC or even extensions of ZFC with large cardinal hypotheses) to uniquely define
such a regularization. In a precise sense, the classical domain of $p.f.$ is optimal. Such results
for a variety of spaces of functions are precisely formulated, and proved using methods from mathematical
logic, descriptive set theory and analysis.
