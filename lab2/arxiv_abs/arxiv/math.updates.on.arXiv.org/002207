The Langlands functoriality conjecture, as reformulated in the "beyond endoscopy" program, predicts
comparisons between the (stable) trace formulas of different groups $G_1, G_2$ for every morphism
${^LG}_1\to {^LG}_2$ between their $L$-groups. This conjecture can be seen as a special case of
a more general conjecture, which replaces reductive groups by spherical varieties and the trace
formula by its generalization, the relative trace formula (RTF). The goal of this article is to demonstrate,
by example, the existence of "transfer operators" betweeen RTFs, that generalize the scalar transfer
factors of endoscopy. These transfer operators have all properties that one could expect from a
trace formula comparison: matching, fundamental lemma for the Hecke algebra, transfer of (relative)
characters. Most importantly, and quite surprisingly, they appear to be of abelian nature, even
though they encompass functoriality relations of non-abelian harmonic analysis. Thus, they are
amenable to application of the Poisson summation formula in order to perform the global comparison.
Moreover, we show that these abelian transforms have some structure as deformations of well-understood
operators when the spaces under consideration are replaced by their "asymptotic cones". In the
article, we develop the local theory behind Rudnick's 1990 thesis (comparing the stable trace formula
for $SL_2$ with the Kuznetsov formula) and Venkatesh's 2002 thesis (providing a "beyond endoscopy"
proof of functorial transfer from tori to $GL_2$). As it turns out, the latter is not completely disjoint
from endoscopic transfer. We also study the functional equation of the symmetric-square $L$-function
for $GL_2$, and show that it is governed by an explicit "Hankel operator" at the level of the Kuznetsov
formula, which is also of abelian nature. Most of our proofs rely on Rankin--Selberg theory.
