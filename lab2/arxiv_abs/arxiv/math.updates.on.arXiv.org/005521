This is the first entry in a planned series aiming to establish a modified, and simpler, formalism
for studying the geometry of smooth manifolds with a metric, while remaining close to standard textbook
treatments in terms of notation and concepts. The key step is extending the tangent space at each
point from a vector space to a geometric algebra, which is a linear space incorporating vectors with
dot and wedge multiplication, and extending the affine connection to a directional derivative
acting naturally on fields of multivectors (elements of the geometric algebra). A short introduction
to geometric algebra is included in the text. The theory that results from this extension is simpler
and more powerful than either differential forms or tensor methods, in a number of ways. The multivector
directional derivative obeys a powerful product rule. Simple conditions are obtained for metric-compatibility
and torsion-freeness of the connection coefficients, and derivatives with torsion are treated
with no extra difficulty. The conceptual distinction between multivectors and tensors is clarified.
The covariant derivative of tensor fields is derived from a simple chain rule. Arbitrary metric
signatures are treated in generality. The curved-manifold equivalents of the gradient, divergence,
and curl operators are investigated, and the (generalized) torsion-free curl is shown to be equivalent
to the exterior derivative of differential forms. Unlike most traditional treatments, the entire
formalism is developed in terms of completely arbitrary vector bases, which may or may not be coordinate
bases and may or may not be orthonormal. Methods of geometric algebra have previously been applied
to vector calculus with great success --- this is a new way of extending those methods to calculus
on curved manifolds.
