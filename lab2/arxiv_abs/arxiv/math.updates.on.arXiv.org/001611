This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of reconstructing a small object from far field
measurements by using the field interaction with a plasmonic particle which can be viewed as a passive
sensor. It is a follow-up of the work [H. Ammari et al., Reconstructing fine details of small objects
by using plasmonic spectroscopic data, SIAM J. Imag. Sci., to appear], where the intermediate interaction
regime was considered. In that regime, it was shown that the presence of the target object induces
small shifts to the resonant frequencies of the plasmonic particle. These shifts, which can be determined
from the far field data, encodes the contracted generalized polarization tensors of the target
object, from which one can perform reconstruction beyond the usual resolution limit. The main argument
is based on perturbation theory. However, the same argument is no longer applicable in the strong
interaction regime as considered in this paper due to the large shift induced by strong field interaction
between the particles. We develop a novel technique based on conformal mapping theory to overcome
this difficulty. The key is to design a conformal mapping which transforms the two particle system
into a shell-core structure, in which the inner dielectric core corresponds to the target object.
We show that a perturbation argument can be used to analyze the shift in the resonant frequencies
due to the presence of the inner dielectric core. This shift also encodes information of the contracted
polarization tensors of the core, from which one can reconstruct its shape, and hence the target
object. Our theoretical findings are supplemented by a variety of numerical results based on an
efficient optimal control algorithm. The results of this paper make the mathematical foundation
for plasmonic sensing complete.
