During decades, mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior of physical and biologic
systems, and to define strategies aiming the minimization of the effects regarding different types
of diseases. In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic
behavior of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity
of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine an optimal control strategy for
vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. For this
purpose, an inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the
compartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. To solve such inverse problem,
the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After this step, two optimal control problems
(mono- and multi-objective) to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19
pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals
during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals
and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal
control problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and Multi-Objective
Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The results regarding the proposed
multi-objective optimal control problem provides a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy
for vaccine administration can be chosen, according to a given criterion.
