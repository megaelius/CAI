We deal with the 3D Navier-Stokes equation in a smooth simply connected bounded domain, with controls
on a non-empty open part of the boundary and a Navier slip-with-friction boundary condition on the
remaining, uncontrolled, part of the boundary. We extend the small-time global exact controllability
result in [J. M. Coron, F. Marbach and F. Sueur, Small-time global exact controllability of the Navier-Stokes
equation with Navier slip-with-friction boundary conditions, J. Eur. Math. Soc., 22 (2020),1625-1673.]
from Leray weak solutions to the case of smooth solutions. Our strategy relies on a refinement of
the method of well-prepared dissipation of the viscous boundary layers which appear near the uncontrolled
part of the boundary, which allows to handle the multi-scale features in a finer topology. As a byproduct
of our analysis we also obtain a small-time global approximate Lagrangian controllability result,
extending to the case of the Navier-Stokes equations the recent results [O. Glass and T. Horsin,
Approximate Lagrangian controllability for the 2-D Euler equation. Application to the control
of the shape of vortex patches, J. Math. Pures Appl. (9), 93 (2010), 61-90], [O. Glass and T. Horsin,
Prescribing the motion of a set of particles in a three-dimensional perfect fluid, SIAM J. Control
Optim., 50 (2012), 2726-2742], [T. Horsin and O. Kavian, Lagrangian controllability of inviscid
incompressible fluids: a constructive approach, ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var., 23 (2017), 1179-1200]
in the case of the Euler equations and the result [O. Glass and T. Horsin, Lagrangian controllability
at low Reynolds number, ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var., 22 (2016), 1040-1053] in the case of the
steady Stokes equations.
