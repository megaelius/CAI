In this article we solve the problem of maximizing the expected utility of future consumption and
terminal wealth to determine the optimal pension or life-cycle fund strategy for a cohort of pension
fund investors. The setup is strongly related to a DC pension plan where additionally (individual)
consumption is taken into account. The consumption rate is subject to a time-varying minimum level
and terminal wealth is subject to a terminal floor. Moreover, the preference between consumption
and terminal wealth as well as the intertemporal coefficient of risk aversion are time-varying
and therefore depend on the age of the considered pension cohort. The optimal consumption and investment
policies are calculated in the case of a Black-Scholes financial market framework and hyperbolic
absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility functions. We generalize Ye (2008) (2008 American Control
Conference, 356-362) by adding an age-dependent coefficient of risk aversion and extend Steffensen
(2011) (Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 35(5), 659-667), Hentschel (2016) (Doctoral
dissertation, Ulm University) and Aase (2017) (Stochastics, 89(1), 115-141) by considering consumption
in combination with terminal wealth and allowing for consumption and terminal wealth floors via
an application of HARA utility functions. A case study on fitting several models to realistic, time-dependent
life-cycle consumption and relative investment profiles shows that only our extended model with
time-varying preference parameters provides sufficient flexibility for an adequate fit. This
is of particular interest to life-cycle products for (private) pension investments or pension
insurance in general.
