We define novel fully combinatorial models of higher categories. Our definitions are based on a
connection of higher categories to "directed spaces". Directed spaces are locally modelled on
manifold diagrams, which are stratifications of the n-cube such that strata are transversal to
the flag foliation of the n-cube. The first part of this thesis develops a combinatorial model for
manifold diagrams called singular n-cubes. In the second part we apply this model to build our notions
of higher categories. Singular n-cubes are "directed triangulations" of space together with a
decomposition into a collection of subspaces or strata. Singular n-cubes can be naturally organised
into two categories. The first, whose morphisms are bundles themselves, is used for the inductive
definition of singular (n+1)-cubes. The second, whose morphisms are "open" base changes, admits
an (epi,mono) factorisation system. Monomorphisms will be called embeddings of cubes. Epimorphisms
will be called collapses and describe how triangulations can be coarsened. Each cube has a unique
coarsest triangulation called its normal form. The existence of normal forms makes the equality
relation of (combinatorially represented) manifold diagrams decidable. As the main application
of the resulting combinatorial framework for manifold diagrams, we give algebraic definitions
of various notions of higher categories. Namely, we define associative n-categories, presented
associative n-categories and presented associative n-groupoids. All three notions will have
strict units and associators; the only weak coherences are homotopies, but we develop a mechanism
for recovering the usual coherence data of weak n-categories, such as associators and pentagonators
and their higher analogues. This will motivate the conjecture that the theory of associative higher
categories is equivalent to its fully weak counterpart.
