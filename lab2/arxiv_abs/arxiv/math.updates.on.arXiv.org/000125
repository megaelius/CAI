This paper presents new results allowing an unknown non-Gaussian positive matrix-valued random
field to be identified through a stochastic elliptic boundary value problem, solving a statistical
inverse problem. A new general class of non-Gaussian positive-definite matrix-valued random
fields, adapted to the statistical inverse problems in high stochastic dimension for their experimental
identification, is introduced and its properties are analyzed. A minimal parametrization of discretized
random fields belonging to this general class is proposed. Using this parametrization of the general
class, a complete identification procedure is proposed. New results of the mathematical and numerical
analyzes of the parameterized stochastic elliptic boundary value problem are presented. The numerical
solution of this parametric stochastic problem provides an explicit approximation of the application
that maps the parameterized general class of random fields to the corresponding set of random solutions.
This approximation can be used during the identification procedure in order to avoid the solution
of multiple forward stochastic problems. Since the proposed general class of random fields possibly
contains random fields which are not uniformly bounded, a particular mathematical analysis is
developed and dedicated approximation methods are introduced. In order to obtain an algorithm
for constructing the approximation of a very high-dimensional map, complexity reduction methods
are introduced and are based on the use of low-rank approximation methods that exploit the tensor
structure of the solution which results from the parametrization of the general class of random
fields.
