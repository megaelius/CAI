A path-matching of order $p$ is a vertex disjoint union of nontrivial paths spanning $p$ vertices.
Burr and Roberts, and Faudree and Schelp determined the 2-color Ramsey number of path matchings.
In this paper we study the multicolor Ramsey number of path matchings. We formulate the following
conjecture which, if true, is best possible: For all integers $p_1\ge \dots\ge p_r\ge 4$, if $n\ge
p_1-(r-1) + \sum_{i=2}^{r}\left\lceil \frac{p_i}{3}\right\rceil$, then every $r$-coloring
of $K_n$ contains a path matching of color $i$ and order at least $p_i$ for some $i\in [r]$. Our main
result is the proof of this conjecture with a small error term which depends only on $r$. We also prove
the conjecture exactly when $n$ is sufficiently large compared to the number of colors, and when
the number of colors is at most 3. As a corollary we get that in every $r$-coloring of $K_n$ there is
a monochromatic path matching of order at least $3\lfloor\frac{n}{r+2}\rfloor$, which is essentially
best possible. The proof of the main result is based on two other results, interesting on their own.
One is a minimax theorem for path matchings derived from a result of Las Vergnas (extending Tutte's
1-factor theorem). The other is an estimate on block sizes of covering designs (which can be also
formulated as an estimate on the sizes of monochromatic $1$-cores in colored complete graphs).
Block sizes in covering designs have been studied intensively before, but only for the uniform case
(when all block sizes are equal). For our purposes we established the following estimate that allows
arbitrary block sizes: For all integers $p_1\ge \dots \ge p_r\geq 2$, if $n\geq \max\left\{p_1,
\frac{5p_1}{6}-\frac{r}{3} + \sum_{i=2}^{r}\frac{p_i}{3}\right\}$ and $B_1,\dots B_r$ are
subsets of $[n]$ such that each pair of $[n]$ is covered by at least one $B_i$, then $|B_i|\ge p_i$
for some $i\in [r]$.
