We study open-closed orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau smooth toric
Deligne-Mumford (DM) stacks (with possibly non-trivial generic stabilizers and semi-projective
coarse moduli spaces) relative to Lagrangian branes of Aganagic-Vafa type. We present foundational
materials of enumerative geometry of stable holomorphic maps from bordered orbifold Riemann surfaces
to a 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau smooth toric DM stack with boundaries mapped into a Aganagic-Vafa
brane. All genus open-closed Gromov-Witten invariants are defined by torus localization and depend
on the choice of a framing which is an integer. We also provide another definition of all genus open-closed
Gromov-Witten invariants based on algebraic relative orbifold Gromov-Witten theory; this generalizes
the definition in Li-Liu-Liu-Zhou [arXiv:math/0408426] for smooth toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
When the toric DM stack a toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold (i.e. when the generic stabilizer is trivial),
we define generating functions of open-closed Gromov-Witten invariants or arbitrary genus $g$
and number $h$ of boundary circles; it takes values in the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology of the classifying
space of a finite cyclic group of order $m$. We prove an open mirror theorem which relates the generating
function of orbifold disk invariants to Abel-Jacobi maps of the mirror curve of the toric Calabi-Yau
3-orbifold. This generalizes a conjecture by Aganagic-Vafa [arXiv:hep-th/0012041] and Aganagic-Klemm-Vafa
[arXiv:hep-th/0105045] (proved in full generality by the first and the second authors in [arXiv:1103.0693])
on the disk potential of a smooth semi-projective toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold.
