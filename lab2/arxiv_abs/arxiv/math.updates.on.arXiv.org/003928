Let $\mathcal{O}$ be an order, that is a commutative ring with $1$ whose additive structure is a free
$\mathbb{Z}$-module of finite rank. A generalized number system (GNS for short) over $\mathcal{O}$
is a pair $(p,\mathcal{D} )$ where $p\in\mathcal{O}[x]$ is monic with constant term $p(0)$ not
a zero divisor of $\mathcal{O}$, and where $\mathcal{D}$ is a complete residue system modulo $p(0)$
in $\mathcal{O}$ containing $0$. We say that $(p,\mathcal{D})$ is a GNS over $\mathcal{O}$ with
the finiteness property if all elements of $\mathcal{O}[x]/(p)$ have a representative in $\mathcal{D}[x]$
(the polynomials with coefficients in $\mathcal{D}$). Our purpose is to extend several of the results
from a previous paper of Peth\H{o} and Thuswaldner, where GNS over orders of number fields were considered.
We prove that it is algorithmically decidable whether or not for a given order $\mathcal{O}$ and
GNS $(p,\mathcal{D})$ over $\mathcal{O}$, the pair $(p,\mathcal{D})$ admits the finiteness
property. This is closely related to work of Vince on matrix number systems. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be
a fundamental domain for $\mathcal{O} \!\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}\! \mathbb{R}/\mathcal{O}$ and
$p\in \mathcal{O}[X]$ a monic polynomial. For $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}$, define $p_{\alpha}(x):=p(x+\alpha
)$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F} ,p(\alpha )}:= p(\alpha )\mathcal{F}\cap\mathcal{O}$. Under
mild conditions we show that the pairs $(p_{\alpha},\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F},p(\alpha)}\,)$
are GNS over $\mathcal{O}$ with finiteness property provided $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}$ in some
sense approximates a sufficiently large positive rational integer. In the opposite direction
we prove under different conditions that $(p_{-m},\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F} ,p(-m)}\,)$ does
not have the finiteness property for each large enough positive rational integer $m$.
