The aim of this work is to demonstrate the efficacy of the non-commutative calculus for quantum field
theory. In so doing, we will consider the application of integrable and differential structures
to local algebras. In the application of integrable structures to local algebras, we make use of
a new approach based on quantum Orlicz spaces. We specifically propose regularity conditions which
in the context of local algebras, ensure good behaviour of field operators as observables, and then
show that fields obtained by the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem are regular in this
sense. This complements earlier work by Buchholz, Driessler, Summers and Wichman, etc, on generalized
$H$-bounds. The pair of Orlicz spaces we explicitly use for this purpose, are respectively built
on the exponential function (for the description of regular field operators) and on an entropic
type function (for the description of the corresponding states). These spaces form a dual pair.
This formalism has been shown to be well suited to a description of quantum statistical mechanics,
and in the present work we show that it is also a very useful and elegant tool for Quantum Field Theory.
Secondly as far as differential structures are concerned, we argue that the formalism based on local
algebras is also well suited to the development of a non-commutative differential geometric structure
along the lines of the du Bois-Violette approach to such a theory. In that way we obtain a complete
depiction: integrable structures based on local algebras provide a static setting for an analysis
of Quantum Field Theory and an effective tool for describing regular behaviour of field operators,
whereas differentiable structures posit indispensable tools for a description of equations of
motion. Finally we indicate that the formalism presented here is also relevant for local algebras
based on Lorentzian manifolds.
