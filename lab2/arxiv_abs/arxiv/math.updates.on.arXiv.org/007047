Dissipative systems play a very important role in several physical models, most notably in Celestial
Mechanics, where the dissipation drives the motion of natural and artificial satellites, leading
them to migration of orbits, resonant states, etc. Hence the need to develop theories that ensure
the existence of structures such as invariant tori or periodic orbits and device efficient computational
methods. In this work we concentrate on the existence of invariant tori for the specific case of dissipative
systems known as "conformally symplectic" systems, which have the property that they transform
the symplectic form into a multiple of itself. To give explicit examples of conformally symplectic
systems, we will present two different models: a discrete system, the standard map, and a continuous
system, the spin-orbit problem. In both cases we will consider the conservative and dissipative
versions, that will help to highlight the differences between the symplectic and conformally symplectic
dynamics. For such dissipative systems we will present a KAM theorem in an a-posteriori format.
The method of proof is based on extending geometric identities originally developed in [39] for
the symplectic case. Besides leading to streamlined proofs of KAM theorem, this method provides
a very efficient algorithm which has been implemented. Coupling an efficient numerical algorithm
with an a-posteriori theorem, we have a very efficient way to provide rigorous estimates close to
optimal. Indeed, the method gives a criterion (the Sobolev blow up criterion) that allows to compute
numerically the breakdown. We will review this method as well as an extension of J. Greene's method
and present the results in the conservative and dissipative standard maps. Computing close to the
breakdown, allows to discover new mathematical phenomena such as the "bundle collapse mechanism".
