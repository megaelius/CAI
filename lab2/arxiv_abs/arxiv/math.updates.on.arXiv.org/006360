We study the non-convex optimization landscape for maximum likelihood estimation in the discrete
orbit recovery model with Gaussian noise. This model is motivated by applications in molecular
microscopy and image processing, where each measurement of an unknown object is subject to an independent
random rotation from a rotational group. Equivalently, it is a Gaussian mixture model where the
mixture centers belong to a group orbit. We show that fundamental properties of the likelihood landscape
depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and the group structure. At low noise, this landscape is "benign"
for any discrete group, possessing no spurious local optima and only strict saddle points. At high
noise, this landscape may develop spurious local optima, depending on the specific group. We discuss
several positive and negative examples, and provide a general condition that ensures a globally
benign landscape. For cyclic permutations of coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^d$ (multi-reference
alignment), there may be spurious local optima when $d \geq 6$, and we establish a correspondence
between these local optima and those of a surrogate function of the phase variables in the Fourier
domain. We show that the Fisher information matrix transitions from resembling that of a single
Gaussian in low noise to having a graded eigenvalue structure in high noise, which is determined
by the graded algebra of invariant polynomials under the group action. In a local neighborhood of
the true object, the likelihood landscape is strongly convex in a reparametrized system of variables
given by a transcendence basis of this polynomial algebra. We discuss implications for optimization
algorithms, including slow convergence of expectation-maximization, and possible advantages
of momentum-based acceleration and variable reparametrization for first- and second-order descent
methods.
