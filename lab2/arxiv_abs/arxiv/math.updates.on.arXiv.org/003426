A comprehensive analysis of periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses in the Euclidean
plane is presented. The novelty of the approach is based on a relationship recently established
by the authors between periodic billiard trajectories and extremal polynomials on the systems
of $d$ intervals on the real line and ellipsoidal billiards in $d$-dimensional space. Even in the
planar case, systematically studied in the present paper it leads to new results in characterizing
$n$ periodic trajectories vs. so-called $n$ elliptic periodic trajectories, which are $n$-periodic
in elliptical coordinates. The characterizations are done both in terms of the underlying elliptic
curve and divisors on it and in terms of polynomial functional equations, like Pell's equation.
This new approach also sheds light on some classical results. In particular we connect search for
caustics which generate periodic trajectories with three classical classes of extremal polynomials
on two intervals, introduced by Zolotarev and Akhiezer. The main classifying tool are winding numbers,
for which we provide several interpretations, including one in terms of numbers of points of alternance
of extremal polynomials. The latter implies important inequality between the winding numbers,
which as a consequence, provides another proof of monotonicity of rotation numbers. A complete
catalog of billiard trajectories with small periods is provided for $n=3, 4, 5, 6$ along with an effective
search for caustics. As a byproduct, an intriguing connection between Cayle type conditions and
discriminantly separable polynomials has been observed for all those small periods.
