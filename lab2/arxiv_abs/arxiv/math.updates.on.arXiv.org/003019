We consider the problem of identifying intermediate variables (or mediators) that regulate the
effect of a treatment on a response variable. While there has been significant research on this topic,
little work has been done when the set of potential mediators is high-dimensional and when they are
interrelated. In particular, we assume that the causal structure of the treatment, the potential
mediators and the response is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). High-dimensional DAG models have
previously been used for the estimation of causal effects from observational data and methods called
IDA and joint-IDA have been developed for estimating the effects of single interventions and multiple
simultaneous interventions respectively. In this paper, we propose an IDA-type method called
MIDA for estimating mediation effects from high-dimensional observational data. Although IDA
and joint-IDA estimators have been shown to be consistent in certain sparse high-dimensional settings,
their asymptotic properties such as convergence in distribution and inferential tools in such
settings remained unknown. We prove high-dimensional consistency of MIDA for linear structural
equation models with sub-Gaussian errors. More importantly, we derive distributional convergence
results for MIDA in similar high-dimensional settings, which are applicable to IDA and joint-IDA
estimators as well. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first distributional convergence
results facilitating inference for IDA-type estimators. These results have been built on our novel
theoretical results regarding uniform bounds for linear regression estimators over varying subsets
of high-dimensional covariates, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we empirically
validate our asymptotic theory and demonstrate the usefulness of MIDA in identifying large mediation
effects via simulations and application to real data in genomics.
