This article deals with two topics: the first, which has a general character, is a variation formula
for the the determinant line bundle in non-K\"ahlerian geometry. This formula, which is a consequence
of the non-K\"ahlerian version of the Grothendieck-Riemann Roch theorem proved recently by Bismut,
gives the variation of the determinant line bundle corresponding to a perturbation of a Fourier-Mukai
kernel ${\cal E}$ on a product $B\times X$ by a unitary flat line bundle on the fiber $X$. When this
fiber is a complex surface and ${\cal E}$ is a holomorphic 2-bundle, the result can be interpreted
as a Donaldson invariant. The second topic concerns a geometric application of our variation formula,
namely we will study compact complex subspaces of the moduli spaces of stable bundles considered
in our program for proving existence of curves on minimal class VII surfaces. Such a moduli space
comes with a distinguished point $a=[{\cal A}]$ corresponding to the canonical extension ${\cal
A}$ of $X$. The compact subspaces $Y\subset {\cal M}^\st$ containing this distinguished point
play an important role in our program. We will prove a non-existence result: there exists no compact
complex subspace of positive dimension $Y\subset {\cal M}^\st$ containing $a$ with an open neighborhood
$a\in Y_a\subset Y$ such that $Y_a\setminus\{a\}$ consists only of non-filtrable bundles. In
other words, within any compact complex subspace of positive dimension $Y\subset {\cal M}^\st$
containing $a$, the point $a$ can be approached by filtrable bundles. Specializing to the case $b_2=2$
we obtain a new way to complete the proof of a theorem in a previous article: any minimal class VII surface
with $b_2=2$ has a cycle of curves. Applications to class VII surfaces with higher $b_2$ will be be
discussed in a forthcoming article.
