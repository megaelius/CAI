A pair $(\Gamma,\Lambda)$, where $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a locally rectifiable curve
and $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a {\em Heisenberg uniqueness pair} if an absolutely continuous
(with respect to arc length) finite complex-valued Borel measure supported on $\Gamma$ whose Fourier
transform vanishes on $\Lambda$ necessarily is the zero measure. Recently, it was shown by Hedenmalm
and Montes that if $\Gamma$ is the hyperbola $x_1x_2=M^2/(4\pi^2)$, where $M>0$ is the mass, and
$\Lambda$ is the lattice-cross $(\alpha\mathbb{Z}\times\{0\}) \cup (\{0\}\times\beta\mathbb{Z})$,
where $\alpha,\beta$ are positive reals, then $(\Gamma,\Lambda)$ is a Heisenberg uniqueness
pair if and only if $\alpha\beta M^2\le4\pi^2$. The Fourier transform of a measure supported on
a hyperbola solves the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation, so the theorem supplies very thin
uniqueness sets for a class of solutions to this equation. The case of the semi-axis $\mathbb{R}_+$
as well as the holomorphic counterpart remained open. In this work, we completely solve these two
problems. As for the semi-axis, we show that the restriction to $\mathbb{R}_+$ of the above exponential
system spans a weak-star dense subspace of $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}_+)$ if and only if $0<\alpha\beta<4$,
based on dynamics of Gauss-type maps. This has an interpretation in terms of dynamical unique continuation.
As for the holomorphic counterpart, we show that the above exponential system with $m,n\ge0$ spans
a weak-star dense subspace of $H^\infty_+(\mathbb{R})$ if and only if $0<\alpha\beta\le1$. To
obtain this result, we need to develop new harmonic analysis tools for the dynamics of Gauss-type
maps, related to the Hilbert transform. Some details are deferred to a separate publication.
