We consider the degenerate parabolic equation with nonlocal source given by \[ u_t=u\Delta u + u
\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |\nabla u|^2, \] which has been proposed as model for the evolution of the density
distribution of frequencies with which different strategies are pursued in a population obeying
the rules of replicator dynamics in a continuous infinite-dimensional setting. Firstly, for all
positive initial data $u_0\in C^0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfying $u_0\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for
some $p\in (0,1)$ as well as $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} u_0=1$, the corresponding Cauchy problem in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is seen to possess a global positive classical solution with the property that $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
u(\cdot,t)=1$ for all $t>0$. Thereafter, the main purpose of this work consists in revealing a dependence
of the large time behavior of these solutions on the spatial decay of the initial data in a direction
that seems unexpected when viewed against the background of known behavior in large classes of scalar
parabolic problems. In fact, it is shown that all considered solutions asymptotically decay with
respect to their spatial $H^1$ norm, so that \[ \mathcal{E}(t):=\int_0^t \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
|\nabla u(\cdot,t)|^2, \qquad t>0, \] always grows in a significantly sublinear manner in that
\begin{equation} \frac{\mathcal{E}(t)}{t} \to 0 \qquad \mbox{as } t\to\infty; \qquad (*) \end{equation}
the precise growth rate of $\mathcal{E}$, however, depends on the initial data in such a way that
fast decay rates of $u_0$ enforce rapid growth of $\mathcal{E}$. To this end, examples of algebraical
and certain exponential types of initial decay are detailed, inter alia generating logarithmic
and arbitrary sublinear algebraic growth rates of $\mathcal{E}$, and moreover indicating that
(*) is essentially optimal.
