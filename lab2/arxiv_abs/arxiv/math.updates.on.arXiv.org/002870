We consider the massive Dirac equation in the non-extreme Kerr geometry in horizon-penetrating
advanced Eddington-Finkelstein-type coordinates and derive a functional analytic integral
representation of the associated propagator using the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint
operators, Stone's formula, and quantities arising in the analysis of Chandrasekhar's separation
of variables. This integral representation describes the dynamics of Dirac particles outside
and across the event horizon, up to the Cauchy horizon. In the derivation, we first write the Dirac
equation in Hamiltonian form and show the essential self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian. For the
latter purpose, as the Dirac Hamiltonian fails to be elliptic at the event and the Cauchy horizon,
we cannot use standard elliptic methods of proof. Instead, we employ a new, general method for mixed
initial-boundary value problems that combines results from the theory of symmetric hyperbolic
systems with near-boundary elliptic methods. In this regard and since the time evolution may not
be unitary because of Dirac particles impinging on the ring singularity, we also impose a suitable
Dirichlet-type boundary condition on a time-like inner hypersurface placed inside the Cauchy
horizon, which has no effect on the dynamics outside the Cauchy horizon. We then compute the resolvent
of the Dirac Hamiltonian via the projector onto a finite-dimensional, invariant spectral eigenspace
of the angular operator and the radial Green's matrix stemming from Chandrasekhar's separation
of variables. Applying Stone's formula to the spectral measure of the Hamiltonian in the spectral
decomposition of the Dirac propagator, that is, by expressing the spectral measure in terms of this
resolvent, we obtain an explicit integral representation of the propagator.
