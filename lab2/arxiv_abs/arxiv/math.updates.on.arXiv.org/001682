The density of a code is the fraction of the coding space covered by packing balls centered around
the codewords. This paper investigates the density of codes in the complex Stiefel and Grassmann
manifolds equipped with the chordal distance. The choice of distance enables the treatment of the
manifolds as subspaces of Euclidean hyperspheres. In this geometry, the densest packings are not
necessarily equivalent to maximum-minimum-distance codes. Computing a code's density follows
from computing: i) the normalized volume of a metric ball and ii) the kissing radius, the radius of
the largest balls one can pack around the codewords without overlapping. First, the normalized
volume of a metric ball is evaluated by asymptotic approximations. The volume of a small ball can
be well-approximated by the volume of a locally-equivalent tangential ball. In order to properly
normalize this approximation, the precise volumes of the manifolds induced by their spherical
embedding are computed. For larger balls, a hyperspherical cap approximation is used, which is
justified by a volume comparison theorem showing that the normalized volume of a ball in the Stiefel
or Grassmann manifold is asymptotically equal to the normalized volume of a ball in its embedding
sphere as the dimension grows to infinity. Then, bounds on the kissing radius are derived alongside
corresponding bounds on the density. Unlike spherical codes or codes in flat spaces, the kissing
radius of Grassmann or Stiefel codes cannot be exactly determined from its minimum distance. It
is nonetheless possible to derive bounds on density as functions of the minimum distance. Stiefel
and Grassmann codes have larger density than their image spherical codes when dimensions tend to
infinity. Finally, the bounds on density lead to refinements of the standard Hamming bounds for
Stiefel and Grassmann codes.
