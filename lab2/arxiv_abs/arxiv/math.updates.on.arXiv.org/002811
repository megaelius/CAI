Motivated by the analysis of Hofstadter-like Hamiltonians for a 2-dimensional crystal in presence
of a uniform transverse magnetic field, we study the possibility to construct spanning sets of exponentially
localized (generalized) Wannier functions for the space of occupied states. When the magnetic
flux per unit cell satisfies a certain rationality condition, by going to the momentum-space description
one can model $m$ occupied energy bands by a real-analytic and $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic family
$\{P(\mathbf{k})\}_{\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{R}^2}$ of orthogonal projections of rank $m$. More
generally, in dimension $d \le 3$, a moving orthonormal basis of $\mathrm{Ran} \: P(\mathbf{k})$
consisting of real-analytic and $\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic Bloch vectors can be constructed if
and only if the first Chern number(s) of $P$ vanish(es). Here we are mainly interested in the topologically
obstructed case. First, by dropping the generating condition, we show how to construct a collection
of $m-1$ orthonormal, real-analytic, and $\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic Bloch vectors. Second, by
dropping the orthonormality condition, we can construct a Parseval frame of $m+1$ real-analytic
and $\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic Bloch vectors which generate $\mathrm{Ran} \: P(\mathbf{k})$.
Both constructions are based on a two-step logarithm method which produces a moving orthonormal
basis in the topologically trivial case. A moving Parseval frame of analytic, $\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic
Bloch vectors corresponds to a Parseval frame of exponentially localized composite Wannier functions.
We extend this construction to the case of Hofstadter-like Hamiltonians with an irrational magnetic
flux per unit cell and show how to produce Parseval frames of exponentially localized generalized
Wannier functions also in this setting.
