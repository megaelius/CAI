Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and let $k$ be a fixed positive integer. We denote by $\mathcal G_{\text{$k$-out}}(G)$
the probability space consisting of subgraphs of $G$ where each vertex $v\in V(G)$ randomly picks
$k$ neighbors from $G$, independently from all other vertices. We show that if $\delta(G)=\omega(\log
n)$ and $k\geq 2$, then the following holds for every $p=\omega\left(\log n/\delta(G)\right)$.
Let $H$ be a random graph obtained by keeping each $e\in E(G)$ with probability $p$ independently
at random and then coloring its edges independently and uniformly at random with elements from the
set $[kn]$. Then, w.h.p. $H$ contains $t:=(1-o(1))\delta(G)p/(2k)$ edge-disjoint graphs $H_1,\ldots,H_t$
such that each of the $H_i$ is \emph{rainbow} (that is, all the edges are colored with distinct colors),
and such that for every monotone increasing property of graphs $\mathcal P$ and for every $1\leq
i\leq t$ we have $\Pr[\mathcal G_{\text{$k$-out}}(G)\models \mathcal P]\leq \Pr[H_i\models
\mathcal P]+n^{-\omega(1)}$. Note that since (in this case) a typical member of $\mathcal G_{\text{$k$-out}}(G)$
has average degree roughly $2k$, this result is asymptotically best possible. We present several
applications of this; for example, we use this result to prove that for $p=\omega(\log n/n)$ and
$c=23n$, a graph $H\sim \mathcal G_{c}(K_n,p)$ w.h.p. contains $(1-o(1))np/46$ edge-disjoint
rainbow Hamilton cycles. More generally, using a recent result of Frieze and Johansson, the same
method allows us to prove that if $G$ has minimum degree $\delta(G)\geq (1+\varepsilon)n/2$, then
there exist functions $c=O(n)$ and $t=\Theta(np)$ (depending on $\varepsilon$) such that the
random subgraph $H\sim \mathcal G_{c}(G,p)$ w.h.p. contains $t$ edge-disjoint rainbow Hamilton
cycles.
