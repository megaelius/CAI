Photo-acoustic tomography is a coupled-physics (hybrid) medical imaging modality that aims to
reconstruct optical parameters in biological tissues from ultrasound measurements. As propagating
light gets partially absorbed, the resulting thermal expansion generates minute ultrasonic signals
(the photo-acoustic effect) that are measured at the boundary of a domain of interest. Standard
inversion procedures first reconstruct the source of radiation by an inverse ultrasound (boundary)
problem and second describe the optical parameters from internal information obtained in the first
step. This paper considers the rotating experimental setting. Light emission and ultrasound measurements
are fixed on a rotating gantry, resulting in a rotation-dependent source of ultrasound. The two-step
procedure we just mentioned does not apply. Instead, we propose an inversion that directly aims
to reconstruct the optical parameters quantitatively. The mapping from the unknown (absorption
and diffusion) coefficients to the ultrasound measurement via the unknown ultrasound source is
modeled as a composition of a pseudo-differential operator and a Fourier integral operator. We
show that for appropriate choices of optical illuminations, the above composition is an elliptic
Fourier integral operator. Under the assumption that the coefficients are unknown on a sufficiently
small domain, we derive from this a (global) injectivity result (measurements uniquely characterize
our coefficients) combined with an optimal stability estimate. The latter is the same as that obtained
in the standard (non-rotating experimental) setting.
