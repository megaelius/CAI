In this paper, we propose a new framework to construct confidence sets for a $d$-dimensional unknown
sparse parameter $\theta$ under the normal mean model $X\sim N(\theta,\sigma^2I)$. A key feature
of the proposed confidence set is its capability to account for the sparsity of $\theta$, thus named
as {\em sparse} confidence set. This is in sharp contrast with the classical methods, such as Bonferroni
confidence intervals and other resampling based procedures, where the sparsity of $\theta$ is
often ignored. Specifically, we require the desired sparse confidence set to satisfy the following
two conditions: (i) uniformly over the parameter space, the coverage probability for $\theta$
is above a pre-specified level; (ii) there exists a random subset $S$ of $\{1,...,d\}$ such that
$S$ guarantees the pre-specified true negative rate (TNR) for detecting nonzero $\theta_j$'s.
To exploit the sparsity of $\theta$, we define that the confidence interval for $\theta_j$ degenerates
to a single point 0 for any $j\notin S$. Under this new framework, we first consider whether there
exist sparse confidence sets that satisfy the above two conditions. To address this question, we
establish a non-asymptotic minimax lower bound for the non-coverage probability over a suitable
class of sparse confidence sets. The lower bound deciphers the role of sparsity and minimum signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) in the construction of sparse confidence sets. Furthermore, under suitable conditions
on the SNR, a two-stage procedure is proposed to construct a sparse confidence set. To evaluate the
optimality, the proposed sparse confidence set is shown to attain a minimax lower bound of some properly
defined risk function up to a constant factor. Finally, we develop an adaptive procedure to the unknown
sparsity and SNR. Numerical studies are conducted to verify the theoretical results.
