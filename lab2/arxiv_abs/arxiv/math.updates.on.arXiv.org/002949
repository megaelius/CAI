Path analysis is a special class of models in structural equation modeling (SEM) where it describes
causal relations among measured variables in a form of linear regression. This paper presents two
estimation formulations for confirmatory and exploratory SEM in path analysis problems where
a zero pattern of the estimated path coefficient matrix explains a causality structure of the variables.
In confirmatory SEM, the original nonlinear equality constraints of model parameters are relaxed
to an inequality, allowing us to transform the original problem into a convex problem. A regularized
estimation formulation is proposed for exploratory SEM, where the objective function is added
with an l1-type penalty of the path coefficient matrix. Under a condition on problem parameters,
we show that our optimal solution is low rank and provides an estimate of the path matrix of the original
problem. To solve our estimation problems in a convex framework, we apply alternating direction
method of multiplier (ADMM) which is shown to be suitable for a large-scale implementation. In combination
with applying model selection criteria, the penalty parameter in the regularized estimation,
controlling the density of nonzero entries in the path matrix, can be chosen to provide a reasonable
trade-off between the model fitting and the complexity of causality structure. The performance
of our approach is demonstrated in both simulated and real data sets, and with a comparison of existing
methods. Real application results include learning causality among climate variables in Thailand
where our findings can explain known relations among air pollutants and weather variables. The
other experiment is to explore connectivities among brain regions using fMRI time series from ABIDE
data sets where our results are interpreted to explain brain network differences in autism patients.
