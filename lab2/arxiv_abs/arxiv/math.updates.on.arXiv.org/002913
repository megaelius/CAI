A full theory for hinged beams and degenerate plates with multiple intermediate piers is developed.
The analysis starts with the variational setting and the study of the linear stationary problem
in one dimension. Well-posedness results are provided and the possible loss of regularity, due
to the presence of the piers, is underlined. A complete spectral theorem is then proved, explicitly
determining the eigenvalues on varying of the position of the piers and exhibiting the fundamental
modes of oscillation. The obtained eigenfunctions are used to tackle the study of the nonlinear
evolution problem in presence of different nonlinearities, focusing on the appearance of linear
and (a suitable notion of) nonlinear instability, with a twofold goal: finding the most reliable
nonlinearity describing the oscillations of real structures and determining the position of the
piers that maximizes the stability of the structure. The last part of the paper is devoted to the study
of degenerate plate models, where the structure is composed by a central beam moving vertically
and by a continuum of cross-sections free to rotate around the beam and allowed to deflect from the
horizontal equilibrium position. The torsional instability of the structure is investigated,
taking into account the impact of different nonlinear terms aiming at modeling the action of cables
and hangers in a suspension bridge. Again, the optimal position of the piers in terms of stability
is discussed. The stability analysis is carried out both by means of analytical tools, such as Floquet
theory, and numerical experiments. Several open problems and possible future developments are
presented.
