This paper has two main goals: (a) establish several statistical properties---consistency, asymptotic
distributions, and convergence rates---of stationary solutions and values of a class of coupled
nonconvex and nonsmoothempirical risk minimization problems, and (b) validate these properties
by a noisy amplitude-based phase retrieval problem, the latter being of much topical interest.Derived
from available data via sampling, these empirical risk minimization problems are the computational
workhorse of a population risk model which involves the minimization of an expected value of a random
functional. When these minimization problems are nonconvex, the computation of their globally
optimal solutions is elusive. Together with the fact that the expectation operator cannot be evaluated
for general probability distributions, it becomes necessary to justify whether the stationary
solutions of the empirical problems are practical approximations of the stationary solution of
the population problem. When these two features, general distribution and nonconvexity, are coupled
with nondifferentiability that often renders the problems "non-Clarke regular", the task of the
justification becomes challenging. Our work aims to address such a challenge within an algorithm-free
setting. The resulting analysis is therefore different from the much of the analysis in the recent
literature that is based on local search algorithms. Furthermore, supplementing the classical
minimizer-centric analysis, our results offer a first step to close the gap between computational
optimization and asymptotic analysis of coupled nonconvex nonsmooth statistical estimation
problems, expanding the former with statistical properties of the practically obtained solution
and providing the latter with a more practical focus pertaining to computational tractability.
