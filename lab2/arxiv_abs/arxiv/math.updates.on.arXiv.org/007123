Experimental characterization of neuronal dynamics involves recording both of spontaneous activity
patterns and of responses to transient and sustained inputs. While much theoretical attention
has been devoted to the spontaneous activity of neurons, less is known about the dynamic mechanisms
shaping their responses to transient inputs, although these bear significant physiological relevance.
Here, we study responses to transient inputs in a widely used class of neuron models (nonlinear adaptive
hybrid models) well-known to reproduce a number of biologically realistic behaviors. We focus
on responses to transient inputs that have been previously associated with Type III neurons, arguably
the least studied category in Hodgkin's classification, which are those neurons that never exhibit
continuous firing in response to sustained excitatory currents. The two phenomena that we study
are post-inhibitory facilitation, in which an otherwise subthreshold excitatory input can induce
a spike if it is applied with proper timing after an inhibitory pulse, and slope detection, in which
a neuron spikes to a transient input only when the input's rate of change is in a specific, bounded
range. We analyze the origin of these phenomena in nonlinear hybrid models and provide a geometric
characterization of dynamical structures associated with PIF in the system and an analytical study
of slope detection for tent inputs. While the necessary and sufficient conditions for these behaviors
are easily satisfied in neurons with Type III excitability, our proofs are quite general and valid
for neurons that do not exhibit Type III excitability as well. This study therefore provides a framework
for the mathematical analysis of these responses to transient inputs associated with Type III neurons
in other systems and for advancing our understanding of these systems' computational properties.
