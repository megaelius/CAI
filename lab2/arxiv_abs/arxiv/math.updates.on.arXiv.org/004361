We consider discrete decreasing minimization problem on an integral base-polyhedron. The problem
is to find a lexicographically minimal integral vector in an integral base-polyhedron, where the
components of a vector are arranged in a decreasing order. This study can be regarded as a discrete
counter-part of the work by Fujishige (1980) on the lexicographically optimal base and the principal
partition of a base-polyhedron in continuous variables. In contrast to the constructive and algorithmic
approach in Part I, Part II offers structural views from discrete convex analysis (DCA) by making
full use of the fundamental results on M-convex sets and M-convex functions. The characterization
of decreasing minimality in terms of 1-tightening steps (exchange operations) is derived from
the local condition of global minimality for M-convex functions, known as M-optimality criterion
in DCA. The min-max formulas are derived as special cases of the Fenchel-type duality in DCA. A general
result on the Fenchel-type duality in DCA offers a short alternative proof to the statement that
the decreasingly minimal elements of an M-convex set form a matroidal M-convex set. A direct characterization
is given to the canonical partition, which was constructed by an iterative procedure in Part I. This
reveals the precise relationship between the canonical partition for the discrete case and the
principal partition for the continuous case. Moreover, this result entails a proximity theorem
with a tight bound, which leads to a continuous relaxation algorithm for finding a decreasingly
minimal element of an M-convex set. Thus the relationship between the continuous and discrete cases
is completely clarified.
