The proliferation of different wireless access technologies, together with the growing number
of multi-radio wireless devices suggest that the opportunistic utilization of multiple connections
at the users can be an effective solution to the phenomenal growth of traffic demand in wireless networks.
In this paper we consider the downlink of a wireless network with $N$ Access Points (AP's) and $M$
clients, where each client is connected to several out-of-band AP's, and requests delay-sensitive
traffic (e.g., real-time video). We adopt the framework of Hou, Borkar, and Kumar, and study the
maximum total timely throughput of the network, denoted by $C_{T^3}$, which is the maximum average
number of packets delivered successfully before their deadline. Solving this problem is challenging
since even the number of different ways of assigning packets to the AP's is $N^M$. We overcome the
challenge by proposing a deterministic relaxation of the problem, which converts the problem to
a network with deterministic delays in each link. We show that the additive gap between the capacity
of the relaxed problem, denoted by $C_{det}$, and $C_{T^3}$ is bounded by $2\sqrt{N(C_{det}+N/4)}$,
which is asymptotically negligible compared to $C_{det}$, when the network is operating at high-throughput
regime. In addition, our numerical results show that the actual gap between $C_{T^3}$ and $C_{det}$
is in most cases much less than the worst-case gap proven analytically. Moreover, using LP rounding
methods we prove that the relaxed problem can be approximated within additive gap of $N$. We extend
the analytical results to the case of time-varying channel states, real-time traffic, prioritized
traffic, and optimal online policies. Finally, we generalize the model for deterministic relaxation
to consider fading, rate adaptation, and multiple simultaneous transmissions.
