This paper deals with some basic constructions of linear and multilinear algebra on finite-dimensional
diffeological vector spaces. We consider the diffeological dual formally checking that the assignment
to each space of its dual defines a covariant functor from the category of finite-dimensional diffeological
vector spaces to the category of standard (that is, carrying the usual smooth structure) vector
spaces. We verify that the diffeological tensor product enjoys the typical properties of the usual
tensor product, after which we focus on the so-called smooth direct sum decompositions, a phenomenon
exclusive to the diffeological setting. We then consider the so-called pseudo-metrics (diffeological
analogues of scalar products), and discuss the consequent decompositions of vector spaces into
a smooth direct sum of the maximal isotropic subspace and a characteristic subspace; we show that
such a decomposition actually depends only on the choice of the coordinate system. Furthermore,
we show that, contrary to what was erroneously claimed (by me) elsewhere, a characteristic subspace
is not unique and is not invariant under the diffeomorphisms of the space on itself. The maximal isotropic
subspace is on the other hand an invariant of the space itself, and this fact allows to assign to each
its well-defined characteristic quotient, obtaining another functor, this time a contravariant
one, to the category of standard vector spaces. After discussing the diffeological analogues of
isometries, we end with some remarks concerning diffeological algebras and diffeological Clifford
algebras. Perhaps a larger than usual part of the paper recalls statements that already appear elsewhere,
but when this is the case, we try to accompany them with new proofs and examples.
