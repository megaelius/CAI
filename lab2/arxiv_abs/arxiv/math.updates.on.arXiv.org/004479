It is known that (i) a subspace ${\mathcal N}$ of the Hardy space $H^2$ which is invariant under the
backward shift operator can be represented as the range of the observability operator of a conservative
discrete-time linear system, (ii) the transfer-function of this conservative linear system in
turn is the inner Beurling-Lax representer for the forward-shift invariant subspace ${\mathcal
M} : = {\mathcal N}^\perp$, and (iii) this transfer function also serves as the Sz.-Nagy-Foias characteristic
function of the pure contraction operator $T$ given by $T = P_{\mathcal N} M_z |_{\mathcal N}$. The
main focus of this paper is to present the extension of this structure to a more general setting. The
Hardy space is replaced by the full weighted Bergman-Fock space of formal power series in $d$ freely
noncommutative indeterminates, where the shift is replaced by the right shift tuple, where the
conservative/dissipative discrete-time linear system becomes a certain type of conservative/dissipative
multidimensional linear system with time-varying weights and with evolution along a rooted tree
with each node having $d$ forward branches, where a backward shift-invariant subspace ${\mathcal
N}$ is the range of the observability operator for such a weighted-Bergman multidimensional linear
system, and where the transfer function of this system is the Beurling-Lax representer for the forward
shift-invariant subspace ${\mathcal M} = {\mathcal N}^{[\perp]}$, and where this transfer function
also serves as the characteristic function for the operator tuple having hypercontractive-operator-tuple
adjoint equal to the restriction of the backward-shift tuple to $\mathcal N$.
