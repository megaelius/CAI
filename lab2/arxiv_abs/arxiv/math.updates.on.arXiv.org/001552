We introduce several notions and give examples. We prove that ${\rm Stab}(D^b(K(l)))\cong {\mathbb
C}\times \mathcal H$ for $l\geq 3$, where $K(l)$ is $l$-Kronecker quiver. This is an example of SOD,
where ${\rm Stab}( \langle \mathcal T_1,\mathcal T_2\rangle )\not \cong{\rm Stab}(\mathcal
T_1)\times {\rm Stab}(\mathcal T_2)$. This example suggest a new notion of a norm, strictly increasing
on $\{D^b(K(l))\}_{l\geq 2}$. To a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ which has property of a phase
gap we attach a non-negative number $\Vert \mathcal T \Vert_{\varepsilon}$. Natural assumptions
on a SOD imply $ \Vert \langle \mathcal T_1,\mathcal T_2\rangle \Vert_{\varepsilon}\geq {\rm
max}\{ \Vert \mathcal T_1 \Vert_{\varepsilon}, \Vert\mathcal T_2 \Vert_{\varepsilon}\}$.
Using this we define a topology on the set of equivalence classes of triangulated categories with
a phase gap, where the set of discrete derived categories is a discrete subset and the rationality
of a smooth surface $S$ ensures that $[D^b(point)] \in {\rm Cl}([D^b(S)])$. Viewing $D^b(K(l))$
as a non-commutative curve, we observe that it is reasonable to count non-commutative curves in
any category in a small neighborhood of $D^b(K(l))$. Examples show that this idea (non-commutative
curve-counting) opens directions to new categorical structures and connections to number theory
and classical geometry. We give a definition, which specializes to the non-commutative curve-counting
invariants. In an example arising on the A side we specialize our definition to non-commutative
Calabi-Yau curve-counting, where the entities we count are a Calabi-Yau modification of $D^b(K(l))$.
Finally we speculate that one might consider a holomorphic family of categories, introduced by
Kontsevich, as a non-commutative extension with the norm playing a role similar to the classical
notion of degree of an extension in Galois theory.
