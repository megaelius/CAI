Inventory models with lost sales and large lead times have traditionally been considered intractable,
due to the curse of dimensionality. Recently, \cite{GKLSS} laid the foundations for a new approach
to solving these models, by proving that as the lead time grows large, a simple constant-order policy
(proposed earlier by \cite{Reiman}) is asymptotically optimal. However, the bounds proven there
are impractical, requiring the lead time to be very large before the constant-order policy becomes
nearly optimal. The authors note that numerical experiments of \cite{Zipkinb} suggest that the
constant-order policy performs quite well even for small lead times, and pose closing this gap (thus
making the results practical) as an open problem. In this work, we make significant progress towards
resolving this open problem and closing this gap. In particular, for the infinite-horizon variant
of the finite-horizon problem considered by \cite{GKLSS}, we prove that the optimality gap of the
same constant-order policy actually converges \emph{exponentially fast} to zero, i.e. we prove
that a lead time which is $O\big(\log(\epsilon^{-1})\big)$ suffices to ensure a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation
guarantee. We demonstrate that the corresponding rate of exponential decay is at least as fast as
the exponential rate of convergence of the expected waiting time in a related single-server queue
to its steady-state value. We also derive simple and explicit bounds for the optimality gap. For
the special case of exponentially distributed demand, we further compute all expressions appearing
in our bound in closed form, and numerically evaluate them, demonstrating good performance for
a wide range of parameter values. Our main proof technique combines convexity arguments with ideas
from queueing theory.
