This work concerns the numerical approximation of the multicomponent compressible Euler system
for a mixture of immiscible fluids in multiple space dimensions and its contribution is twofold.
We first derive an entropy stable, positive and accurate three-point finite volume scheme using
relaxation-based approximate Riemann solvers from Bouchut [Nonlinear stability of finite volume
methods for hyperbolic conservation laws and well-balanced schemes for sources, Frontiers in
Mathematics, Birkhauser, 2004] and Coquel and Perthame [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 35 (1998)]. Then,
we extend these results to the high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM)
based on collocation of quadrature and interpolation points [Kopriva and Gassner, J. Sci. Comput.,
44 (2010)]. The method relies on the framework introduced by Fisher and Carpenter [J. Comput. Phys.,
252 (2013)] and Gassner [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 35 (2013),] where we replace the physical fluxes by
entropy conservative numerical fluxes [Tadmor, Math. Comput., 49 (1987)] in the integral over
discretization cells, while entropy stable numerical fluxes are used at cell interfaces. Time
discretization is performed with a strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme. We design
two-point numerical fluxes satisfying the Tadmor's entropy conservation condition and use the
numerical flux from the three-point scheme as entropy stable flux. We derive conditions on the numerical
parameters to guaranty a semi-discrete entropy inequality and positivity of the fully discrete
DGSEM scheme at any approximation order. The scheme is also accurate in the sense that the solution
at interpolation points is exact for stationary contact waves. Numerical experiments in one and
two space dimensions on flows with discontinuous solutions support the conclusions of our analysis
and highlight stability, robustness and high resolution of the scheme.
