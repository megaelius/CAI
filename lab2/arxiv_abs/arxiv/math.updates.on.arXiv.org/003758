A graph $G$ is called universal for a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ if it contains every element
$F \in \mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. Let $\mathcal{F}(n,2)$ be the family of all graphs with maximum
degree $2$. Ferber, Kronenberg, and Luh [Embedding large graphs into a random graph, Bulletin of
the London Mathematical Society 49 (2017), no. 5, 784-797] proved that there exists a $C$ such that
for $p \ge C (n^{-2/3} \log^{1/3} n )$ the random graph $G(n,p)$ a.a.s is $\mathcal{F}(n,2)$-universal,
which is asymptotically optimal. For any $n$-vertex graph $G_\alpha$ with minimum degree $\delta(G_\alpha)
\ge \alpha n$ Aigner and Brandt [Embedding arbitrary graphs of maximum degree two, Journal of the
London Mathematical Society 48 (1993), 39-51] proved that $G_\alpha$ is $\mathcal{F}(n,2)$-universal
for an optimal $\alpha \ge 2/3$. In this note, we consider the model of randomly perturbed graphs,
which is the union $G_\alpha \cup G(n,p)$. We prove that $G_\alpha \cup G(n,p)$ is a.a.s. $\mathcal{F}(n,2)$-universal
provided that $\alpha>0$ and $p=\omega(n^{-2/3})$. This is asymptotically optimal and improves
on both results from above in the respective parameter. Furthermore, this extends a result of B\"ottcher,
Montgomery, Parczyk, and Person [Embedding spanning bounded degree subgraphs in randomly perturbed
graphs, arXiv:1802.04603 (2018)], who embed a given $F \in \mathcal{F}(n,2)$ at these values.
We also prove variants with universality for the family $\mathcal{F}^\ell(n,2)$, all graphs from
$\mathcal{F}(n,2)$ with girth at least $\ell$. For example, there exists an $\ell_0$ depending
only on $\alpha$ such that for all $\ell \ge \ell_0$ already $p=\omega(1/n)$ is sufficient for $\mathcal{F}^\ell(n,2)$-universality.
