In this paper we construct two new fusion categories and many new subfactors related to the exceptional
Extended Haagerup subfactor. The Extended Haagerup subfactor has two even parts EH1 and EH2. These
fusion categories are mysterious and are the only known fusion categories which appear to be unrelated
to finite groups, quantum groups, or Izumi quadratic categories. One key technique which has previously
revealed hidden structure in fusion categories is to study all other fusion categories in the Morita
equivalence class, and hope that one of the others is easier to understand. In this paper we show that
there are exactly four categories (EH1, EH2, EH3, EH4) in the Morita equivalence class of Extended
Haagerup, and that there is a unique Morita equivalence between each pair. The existence of EH3 and
EH4 gives a number of interesting new subfactors. Neither EH3 nor EH4 appears to be easier to understand
than the Extended Haaerup subfactor, providing further evidence that Extended Haagerup does not
come from known constructions. We also find several interesting intermediate subfactor lattices
related to Extended Haagerup. The method we use to construct EH3 and EH4 is interesting in its own
right and gives a general computational recipe for constructing fusion categories in the Morita
equivalence class of a subfactor. We show that pivotal module $\rm C^*$ categories over a given subfactor
correspond exactly to realizations of that subfactor planar algebra as a planar subalgebra of a
graph planar algebra. This allows us to construct EH3 and EH4 by realizing the Extended Haagerup
subfactor planar algebra inside the graph planar algebras of two new graphs. This technique also
answers a long-standing question of Jones: which graph planar algebras contain a given subfactor
planar algebra?
