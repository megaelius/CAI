The major results of $[3.],$ leading to the spherical Bochner theorem and its (spherical) extension,
were made possible through the spherical transform theory of Trombi-Varadarajan $[14.]$ and were
greatly controlled by the non-availability of the full (non-spherical) Harish-Chandra Fourier
transform theory on a general connected semisimple Lie group, $G.$ Sequel to the recently announced
results of Oyadare $[13.],$ where the full image of the Schwartz-type algebras, $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G),$
under the full Fourier transform is computed to be $\mathcal{C}^{p}(\widehat{G}):=\{(\widehat{\xi_{1}})^{-1}\cdot
h\cdot (\widehat{\xi_{1}})^{-1}:h\in\bar{\mathcal{Z}}({\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon})\}$
with $\bar{\mathcal{Z}}({\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon})$ given as the Trombi-Varadarajan image
of $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G//K),$ the present paper now gives the full Bochner theorem for $G$ by lifting
the results of $[3.]$ to full non-spherical status. An extension of the full Bochner theorem to all
of $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G),$ $1\leq p\leq2,$ is established. It is also conjectured that every positive-definite
distribution $T$ on $G$ which corresponds to a Bochner measure $\mu$ on ${\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon}$
extends uniquely to an element of $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G)'$ if and only if $T$ can be expressed as a finite
sum of derivatives of a class of functions exclusively parameterized by members of ${\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon}$
and $supp\; (\mu)\subset{\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon},$ with $\epsilon=(\frac{2}{p})-1$ for
all $1\leq p\leq2.$ This gives the non-spherical abstract version of the extension theorem for
any positive-definite distribution on $G.$ Our results confirm the one-to-one correspondence
between tempered invariant positive-definite distributions and the Bochner measures of the case
$SU(1,1)/\{\pm1\}$ (as computed in $[5.]$) for all $G.$
