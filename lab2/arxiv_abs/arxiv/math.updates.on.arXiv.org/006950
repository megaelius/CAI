Much work in the study of large deviations for random graph models is focused on the dense regime where
the theory of graphons has emerged as a principal tool. These tools do not give a good approach to large
deviation problems for random graph models in the sparse regime. The aim of this paper is to study
an approach for large deviation problems in this regime by establishing Large Deviation Principles
(LDP) on suitable path spaces for certain exploration processes of the associated random graph
sequence. Our work focuses on the study of one particular class of random graph models, namely the
configuration model; however the general approach of using exploration processes for studying
large deviation properties of sparse random graph models has broader applicability. The goal is
to study asymptotics of probabilities of non-typical behavior in the large network limit. The first
key step for this is to establish a LDP for an exploration process associated with the configuration
model. A suitable exploration process here turns out to be an infinite dimensional Markov process
with transition probability rates that diminish to zero in certain parts of the state space. Large
deviation properties of such Markovian models is challenging due to poor regularity behavior of
the associated local rate functions. Next, using the rate function in the LDP for the exploration
process we formulate a calculus of variations problem associated with the asymptotics of component
degree distributions. The second key ingredient in our study is a careful analysis of the infinite
dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations associated with this calculus of variations problem. Exact
solutions are identified which then provide explicit formulas for decay rates of probabilities
of non-typical component degree distributions and related quantities. Please see the paper for
