Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is a goto solver for symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems
resulting from the discretization of elliptic PDEs or the spatial discretization of parabolic
PDEs. For diffusion-like problems, the time to solution typically scales linearly with the number
of unknowns. However, convergence theory and most variations of AMG rely on A being SPD. Hyperbolic
PDEs, which arise often in large-scale scientific simulations, remain a challenge for AMG, as well
as other fast linear solvers, in part because the resulting linear systems are highly nonsymmetric.
Here, a novel convergence framework is developed for nonsymmetric reduction-based AMG, and sufficient
conditions derived for l^2-convergence of error and residual. In particular, classical multigrid
approximation properties are connected with reduction-based measures to develop a robust framework
for nonsymmetric, reduction-based AMG. Matrices with block-triangular structure are then recognized
as being amenable to reduction-type algorithms, and a reduction-based AMG method is developed
for upwind discretizations of hyperbolic PDEs, based on the concept of a Neumann approximation
to ideal restriction (nAIR). nAIR can be seen as a variation of local AIR (lAIR), specifically targeting
matrices with triangular structure. Although less versatile than lAIR, setup times for nAIR can
be substantially faster, 20x or more, for problems in high dimensions or discretized using high-order
finite elements. nAIR is shown to be an effective and scalable solver of steady state transport for
discontinuous, upwind discretizations, and up to 6th-order finite elements, offering a significant
improvement over existing AMG methods. Although nAIR is designed for block-triangular matrices,
it is also effective on several classes of "nearly triangular" matrices, resulting from curvilinear
finite elements and artificial diffusion.
