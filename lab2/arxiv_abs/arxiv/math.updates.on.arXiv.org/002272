In the mathematical physics literature, there are heuristic arguments, going back three decades,
suggesting that for an open set of initially smooth solutions to the Einstein-vacuum equations
in high dimensions, stable, approximately monotonic curvature singularities can dynamically
form along a spacelike hypersurface. In this article, we study the Cauchy problem and give a rigorous
proof of this phenomenon in sufficiently high dimensions, thereby providing the first constructive
proof of stable curvature blowup (without symmetry assumptions) along a spacelike hypersurface
as an effect of pure gravity. Our proof applies to an open subset of regular initial data satisfying
the assumptions of Hawking's celebrated "singularity" theorem, which shows that the solution
is geodesically incomplete but does not reveal the nature of the incompleteness. Specifically,
our main result is a proof of the dynamic stability of the Kasner curvature singularity for a subset
of Kasner solutions whose metrics exhibit only moderately (as opposed to severely) spatially anisotropic
behavior. Of independent interest is our method of proof, which is more robust than earlier approaches
in that i) it does not rely on approximate monotonicity identities and ii) it accommodates the possibility
that the solution develops very singular high-order spatial derivatives, whose blowup rates are
allowed to be, within the scope of our bootstrap argument, much worse than those of the base-level
quantities driving the fundamental blowup. For these reasons, our approach could be used to obtain
similar blowup results for various Einstein-matter systems in any number of spatial dimensions
for solutions corresponding to an open set of moderately spatially anisotropic initial data, thus
going beyond the nearly spatially isotropic regime treated in earlier works.
