We investigate the problem of nodes clustering under privacy constraints when representing a dataset
as a graph. Our contribution is threefold. First we formally define the concept of differential
privacy for structured databases such as graphs, and give an alternative definition based on a new
neighborhood notion between graphs. This definition is adapted to particular frameworks that
can be met in various application fields such as genomics, world wide web, population survey, etc.
Second, we introduce a new algorithm to tackle the issue of privately releasing an approximated
minimum spanning tree topology for a simple-undirected-weighted graph. It provides a simple way
of producing the topology of a private almost minimum spanning tree which outperforms, in most cases,
the state of the art "Laplace mechanism" in terms of weight-approximation error. Finally, we propose
a theoretically motivated method combining a sanitizing mechanism (such as Laplace or our new algorithm)
with a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)-based clustering algorithm. It provides an accurate method
for nodes clustering in a graph while keeping the sensitive information contained in the edges weights
of the private graph. We provide some theoretical results on the robustness of an almost minimum
spanning tree construction for Laplace sanitizing mechanisms. These results exhibit which conditions
the graph weights should respect in order to consider that the nodes form well separated clusters
both for Laplace and our algorithm as sanitizing mechanism. The method has been experimentally
evaluated on simulated data, and preliminary results show the good behavior of the algorithm while
identifying well separated clusters.
