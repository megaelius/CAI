We uncover and highlight relations between the M-branes in M-theory and various topological invariants:
the Hopf invariant over $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$, the Kervaire invariant,
the $f$-invariant, and the $\nu$-invariant. This requires either a framing or a corner structure.
The canonical framing provides a minimum for the classical action and the change of framing encodes
the structure of the action and possible anomalies. We characterize the flux quantization condition
on the C-field and the topological action of the M5-brane via the Hopf invariant, and the dual of the
C-field as (a refinement of) an element of Hopf invariant two. In the signature formulation, the
contribution to the M-brane effective action is given by the Maslov index of the corner. The Kervaire
invariant implies that the effective action of the M5-brane is quadratic. Our study leads to viewing
the self-dual string, which is the boundary of the M2-brane on the M5-brane worldvolume, as a string
theory in the sense of cobordism of manifolds with corners. We show that the dynamics of the C-field
and its dual are encoded in unified way in the 4-sphere, which suggests the corresponding spectrum
as the generalized cohomology theory describing the fields. The effective action of the corner
is captured by the $f$-invariant, which is an invariant at chromatic level two. Finally, considering
M-theory on manifolds with G_2 holonomy we show that the canonical ${\rm G}_2$ structure minimizes
the topological part of the M5-brane action. This is done via the $\nu$-invariant and a variant that
we introduce related to the one-loop polynomial.
