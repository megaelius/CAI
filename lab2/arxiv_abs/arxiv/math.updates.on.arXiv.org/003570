The main purpose of this paper is to study $L^p$ H\"older type estimates for a bi-parameter trilinear
Fourier multiplier with flag singularity, and the analogous pseudo-differential operator, when
the symbols are in a certain product form. More precisely, for $f,g,h\in \mathcal{S}({\mathcal
{R}}^{2})$, the bi-parameter trilinear flag Fourier multiplier operators we consider are defined
by \begin{equation*} T_{m_1,m_2}(f,g,h)(x):=\int_{{\mathcal {R}}^{6}}m_1(\xi,\eta,\zeta)m_2(\eta,\zeta)\hat
f(\xi) \hat g(\eta)\hat h(\zeta)e^{2\pi i(\xi+\eta+\zeta)\cdot x}d\xi d\eta d\zeta, \end{equation*}
when $m_1,m_2$ are two bi-parameter symbols. We prove that $T_{m_1,m_2}$ is bounded from $L^{p_1}\times
L^{p_2}\times L^{p_3}$ to $L^r$ for $1<p_1,p_2,p_3< \infty$ with $1/p_1+1/p_2+1/p_3=1/r$,
and $0<r<\infty$ (see Theorem 1.7). We also establish these $L^p$ estimates for the corresponding
bi-parameter trilinear pseudo-differential operators defined by \begin{equation*} T_{ab}(f,g,h)(x):=\int_{{\mathcal
{R}}^6}a(x,\xi,\eta,\zeta)b(x,\eta,\zeta)\hat f(\xi)\hat g(\eta)\hat h(\zeta)e^{2\pi
i x(\xi+\eta+\zeta)}d\xi d\eta d\zeta, \end{equation*} where the smooth symbols $a,b$ satisfy
certain bi-parameter H\"ormander conditions (see Theorem 1.8). The bi-parameter and trilinear
flag Fourier multipliers considered in this paper do not satisfy the conditions of the classical
bi-parameter trilinear Fourier multipliers considered by Muscalu, Tao, Thiele and the second
author [16, 17] and thus our $L^p$ estimates generalize those established in [16, 17]. They may also
be viewed as the bi-parameter trilinear variants of estimates obtained for the one-parameter flag
paraproducts by Muscalu [13].
