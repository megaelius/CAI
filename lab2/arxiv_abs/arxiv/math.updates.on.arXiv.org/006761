In this paper, we give precisely the geometric constraint conditions of canonical symplectic form
and regular reduced symplectic forms for the dynamical vector fields of a regular controlled Hamiltonian
(RCH) system and its regular reduced systems, which are called the Type I and Type II of Hamilton-Jacobi
equations. At first, we first prove two types of Hamilton-Jacobi theorem for an RCH system on cotangent
bundle of a configuration manifold, by using the canonical symplectic form and the dynamical vector
field, which are the development of the two types of geometric version of Hamilton-Jacobi theorem
for a Hamiltonian system given in Wang \cite{wa17}. Moreover, we also prove two types of Hamilton-Jacobi
theorem for a controlled magnetic Hamiltonian (CMH) system by using the magnetic symplectic form
and the magnetic Hamiltonian vector field. Secondly, we generalize the above results for a regular
reducible RCH system with symmetry and momentum map, and prove two types of Hamilton-Jacobi theorems
for the regular point reduced RCH system and the regular orbit reduced RCH system. Thirdly, we prove
that the RCH-equivalence for the RCH system, and RpCH-equivalence and RoCH- equivalence for the
regular reducible RCH systems with symmetries, leave the solutions of corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi
equations invariant. Finally, as an application of the theoretical results, we show the Type I and
Type II of Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the $R_p$-reduced controlled rigid body-rotor system
and the $R_p$-reduced controlled heavy top-rotor system on the generalizations of rotation group
SO(3) and Euclidean group SE(3), respectively. These researches reveal the deeply internal relationships
of the geometrical structures of phase spaces, the dynamical vector fields and controls of the RCH
system.
