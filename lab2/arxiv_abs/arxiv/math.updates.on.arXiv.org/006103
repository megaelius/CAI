The orthogonality dimension of a graph $G=(V,E)$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is the smallest integer
$t$ for which there exists an assignment of a vector $u_v \in \mathbb{F}^t$ with $\langle u_v,u_v
\rangle \neq 0$ to every vertex $v \in V$, such that $\langle u_v, u_{v'} \rangle = 0$ whenever $v$
and $v'$ are adjacent vertices in $G$. The study of the orthogonality dimension of graphs is motivated
by various application in information theory and in theoretical computer science. The contribution
of the present work is two-folded. First, we prove that there exists a constant $c$ such that for every
sufficiently large integer $t$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to decide whether the orthogonality
dimension of an input graph over $\mathbb{R}$ is at most $t$ or at least $3t/2-c$. At the heart of the
proof lies a geometric result, which might be of independent interest, on a generalization of the
orthogonality dimension parameter for the family of Kneser graphs, analogously to a long-standing
conjecture of Stahl (J. Comb. Theo. Ser. B, 1976). Second, we study the smallest possible orthogonality
dimension over finite fields of the complement of graphs that do not contain certain fixed subgraphs.
In particular, we provide an explicit construction of triangle-free $n$-vertex graphs whose complement
has orthogonality dimension over the binary field at most $n^{1-\delta}$ for some constant $\delta
>0$. Our results involve constructions from the family of generalized Kneser graphs and they are
motivated by the rigidity approach to circuit lower bounds. We use them to answer a couple of questions
raised by Codenotti, Pudl\'{a}k, and Resta (Theor. Comput. Sci., 2000), and in particular, to disprove
their Odd Alternating Cycle Conjecture over every finite field.
