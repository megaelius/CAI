In this paper we focus on measures defined on dyadic sets which are sets with an ordered binary tree
of subsets. An example is the partition of the unit interval into dyadic subintervals. The measures
are defined on the sigma algebra generated by the subsets in the binary tree. We present three types
of theoretical results based on theorems of Fefferman, Pipher and Kenig, Beurling and Ahlfors,
and Kahane to obtain a dyadic product formula representation lemma, a visualization theorem, and
a multi-scale noise theorem for these measures. The dyadic product formula representation lemma
provides an explicit set of product coefficient parameters which are sufficient to distinguish
measures on dyadic sets. The visualization theorem shows that measures whose product coefficient
satisfy a mild condition can be represented by plane Jordan curves and characterizes the uniqueness
of the representing curves. The multiscale noise theorem shows that there is a multiscale noise
model for measures on dyadic sets which produces measures in the same family, i.e. measures on dyadic
sets with finite non-zero volume, even when the binary tree of dyadic sets is infinite. We formulate
these three mathematical results in terms of a common statistical parameter, the product coefficient
parameter. The three theorems provide a mathematical basis for a new multi-scale methodology for
representation of a broad class of real world data sets as measures, for representation of these
measures as Jordan plane curves, enabling visualization of the data, and for representation of
multi-scale noise models for the measures as measures in the same family. We algorithmize the methodology
and illustrate it in examples and summaries of several applications to real world network and sensor
data. The applications illustrate the utility of the methodology for supervised and unsupervised
machine learning.
