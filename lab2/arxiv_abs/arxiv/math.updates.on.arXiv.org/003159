We propose a new approach to the numerical solution of radiative transfer equations with certified
a posteriori error bounds. A key role is played by stable Petrov--Galerkin type variational formulations
of parametric transport equations and corresponding radiative transfer equations. This allows
us to formulate an iteration in a suitable, infinite dimensional function space that is guaranteed
to converge with a fixed error reduction per step. The numerical scheme is then based on approximately
realizing this iteration within dynamically updated accuracy tolerances that still ensure convergence
to the exact solution. To advance this iteration two operations need to be performed within suitably
tightened accuracy tolerances. First, the global scattering operator needs to be approximately
applied to the current iterate within a tolerance comparable to the current accuracy level. Second,
parameter dependent linear transport equations need to be solved, again at the required accuracy
of the iteration. To ensure that the stage dependent error tolerances are met, one has to employ rigorous
a posteriori error bounds which, in our case, rest on a Discontinuous Petrov--Galerkin (DPG) scheme.
These a posteriori bounds are not only crucial for guaranteeing the convergence of the perturbed
iteration but are also used to generate adapted parameter dependent spatial meshes. This turns
out to significantly reduce overall computational complexity. Since the global operator is only
applied, we avoid the need to solve linear systems with densely populated matrices. Moreover, the
approximate application of the global scatterer accelerated through low-rank approximation
and matrix compression techniques. The theoretical findings are illustrated and complemented
by numerical experiments with non-trivial scattering kernels.
