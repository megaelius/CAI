In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for modeling time-variant stochastic channels
in diffusive mobile molecular communication (MC) systems. In particular, we consider a diffusive
mobile MC system consisting of a pair of transmitter and receiver nano-machines suspended in a fluid
medium with a uniform bulk flow, where we model the mobility of the nano-machines by Brownian motion.
The transmitter and receiver nano-machines exchange information via diffusive signaling molecules.
Due to the random movements of the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the statistics of the
channel impulse response (CIR) change over time. In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework
for characterization of the impulse response of time-variant MC channels. To this end, we derive
closed-form expressions for the mean, the autocorrelation function, the cumulative distribution
function (CDF), and the probability density function (PDF) of the time-variant CIR. Given the autocorrelation
function, we define the coherence time of the time-variant MC channel as a metric for characterization
of the variations of the impulse response. The derived CDF is employed for calculation of the outage
probability of the system. We also show that under certain conditions, the PDF of the CIR can be accurately
approximated by a Log-normal distribution. Given this approximation, we derive a simple model
for outdated channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for
evaluation of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the considered MC system.
In order to investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation over time, we compare the performances of
a detector with perfect CSI knowledge and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of
the proposed analytical expressions is verified via particle-based simulation of the Brownian
motion.
