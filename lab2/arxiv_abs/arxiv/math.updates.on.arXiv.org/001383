Single-Particle Reconstruction (SPR) in Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is the task of estimating
the 3D structure of a molecule from a set of noisy 2D projections, taken from unknown viewing directions.
Many algorithms for SPR start from an initial reference molecule, and alternate between refining
the estimated viewing angles given the molecule, and refining the molecule given the viewing angles.
This scheme is called iterative refinement. Reliance on an initial, user-chosen reference introduces
model bias, and poor initialization can lead to slow convergence. Furthermore, since no ground
truth is available for an unsolved molecule, it is difficult to validate the obtained results. This
creates the need for high quality ab initio models that can be quickly obtained from experimental
data with minimal priors, and which can also be used for validation. We propose a procedure to obtain
such an ab initio model directly from raw data using Kam's autocorrelation method. Kam's method
has been known since 1980, but it leads to an underdetermined system, with missing orthogonal matrices.
Until now, this system has been solved only for special cases, such as highly symmetric molecules
or molecules for which a homologous structure was already available. In this paper, we show that
knowledge of just two clean projections is sufficient to guarantee a unique solution to the system.
This system is solved by an optimization-based heuristic. For the first time, we are then able to
obtain a low-resolution ab initio model of an asymmetric molecule directly from raw data, without
2D class averaging and without tilting. Numerical results are presented on both synthetic and experimental
data.
