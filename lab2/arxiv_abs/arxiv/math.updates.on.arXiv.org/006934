We consider the operator $${\cal H} = {\cal H}' -\frac{\partial^2\ }{\partial x_d^2} \quad\text{on}\quad\omega\times\mathbb{R}$$
subject to the Dirichlet or Robin condition, where a domain $\omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$
is bounded or unbounded. The symbol ${\cal H}'$ stands for a second order self-adjoint differential
operator on $\omega$ such that the spectrum of the operator ${\cal H}'$ contains several discrete
eigenvalues $\Lambda_{j}$, $j=1,\ldots, m$. These eigenvalues are thresholds in the essential
spectrum of the operator ${\cal H}$. We study how these thresholds bifurcate once we add a small localized
perturbation $\epsilon{\cal L}(\epsilon)$ to the operator ${\cal H}$, where $\epsilon$ is a small
positive parameter and ${\cal L}(\epsilon)$ is an abstract, not necessarily symmetric operator.
We show that these thresholds bifurcate into eigenvalues and resonances of the operator ${\cal
H}$ in the vicinity of $\Lambda_j$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon$. We prove effective simple
conditions determining the existence of these resonances and eigenvalues and find the leading
terms of their asymptotic expansions. Our analysis applies to generic non-self-adjoint perturbations
and, in particular, to perturbations characterized by the parity-time ($PT$) symmetry. Potential
applications of our result embrace a broad class of physical systems governed by dispersive or diffractive
effects. We use our findings to develop a scheme for a controllable generation of non-Hermitian
optical states with normalizable power and real part of the complex-valued propagation constant
lying in the continuum. The corresponding eigenfunctions can be interpreted as an optical generalization
of bound states in the continuum. For a particular example, the persistence of asymptotic expansions
is confirmed with direct numerical evaluation of the perturbed spectrum.
