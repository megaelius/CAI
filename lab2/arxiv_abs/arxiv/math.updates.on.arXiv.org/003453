We study the question whether rational homogeneous spaces are rigid under Fano deformation. In
other words, given any smooth connected family f:X -> Zof Fano manifolds, if one fiber is biholomorphic
to a rational homogeneous space S, whether is f an S-fibration? The cases of Picard number one were
studied in a series of papers by J.-M. Hwang and N. Mok. For higher Picard number cases, we notice that
the Picard number of a rational homogeneous space G/P is less or equal to the rank of G. Recently A.
Weber and J. A. Wisniewski proved that rational homogeneous spaces G/P with Picard numbers equal
to the rank of G (i.e. complete flag manifolds) are rigid under Fano deformation. In this paper we
show that the rational homogeneous space G/P is rigid under Fano deformation, providing that G is
a simple algebraic group of type ADE, the Picard number equal to rank(G)-1 and G/P is not biholomorphic
to F(1, 2, P^3) or F(1, 2, Q^6). The variety F(1, 2, P^3) is the set of flags of projective lines and planes
in P^3, and F(1, 2, Q^6) is the set of flags of projective lines and planes in 6-dimensional smooth
quadric hypersurface. We show that F(1, 2, P^3) have a unique Fano degeneration, which is explicitly
constructed. The structure of possible Fano degeneration of F(1, 2, Q^6) is also described explicitly.
To prove our rigidity result, we firstly show that the Fano deformation rigidity of a homogeneous
space of type ADE can be implied by that property of suitable homogeneous submanifolds. Then we complete
the proof via the study of Fano deformation rigidity of rational homogeneous spaces of small Picard
numbers. As a byproduct, we also show the Fano deformation rigidity of other manifolds such as F(0,
1, ..., k_1, k_2, k_2+1, ..., n-1, P^n) and F(0, 1, ..., k_1, k_2, k_2+1, ..., n, Q^{2n+2}) with 0 <=
k_1 < k_2 <= n-1.
