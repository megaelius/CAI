M\"{o}bius transformations have been used in numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues
and invariant subspaces of structured generalized and polynomial eigenvalue problems (PEPs).
These transformations convert problems with certain structures arising in applications into
problems with other structures and whose eigenvalues and invariant subspaces are easily related
to the ones of the original problem. Thus, an algorithm that is efficient and stable for some particular
structure can be used for solving efficiently another type of structured problem via an adequate
M\"{o}bius transformation. A key question in this context is whether these transformations may
change significantly the conditioning of the problem and the backward errors of the computed solutions,
since, in that case, their use may lead to unreliable results. We present the first general study
on the effect of M\"{o}bius transformations on the eigenvalue condition numbers and backward errors
of approximate eigenpairs of PEPs. By using the homogeneous formulation of PEPs, we are able to obtain
two clear and simple results. First, we show that, if the matrix inducing the M\"{o}bius transformation
is well conditioned, then such transformation approximately preserves the eigenvalue condition
numbers and backward errors when they are defined with respect to perturbations of the matrix polynomial
which are small relative to the norm of the polynomial. However, if the perturbations in each coefficient
of the matrix polynomial are small relative to the norm of that coefficient, then the corresponding
eigenvalue condition numbers and backward errors are preserved approximately by the M\"{o}bius
transformations induced by well-conditioned matrices only if a penalty factor, depending on those
coefficients, is moderate. It is important to note that these simple results are no longer true if
a non-homogeneous formulation is used.
