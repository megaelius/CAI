A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is \emph{isolating} if every component of $G-V(C)$ is a single vertex. We
show that isolating cycles in polyhedral graphs can be extended to larger ones: every isolating
cycle $C$ of length $6 \leq |E(C)| < \left \lfloor \frac{2}{3}(|V(G)|+4) \right \rfloor$ implies
an isolating cycle $C'$ of larger length that contains $V(C)$. By "hopping" iteratively to such
larger cycles, we obtain a powerful and very general inductive motor for proving long cycles and
computing them (we will give an algorithm with quadratic running time). This is the first step towards
the so far elusive quest of finding a universal induction that captures longest cycles of polyhedral
graph classes. Our motor provides also a method to prove linear lower bounds on the length of Tutte
cycles, as $C'$ will be a Tutte cycle of $G$ if $C$ is. We prove in addition that $|E(C')| \leq |E(C)|+3$
if $G$ contains no face of size five, which gives a new tool for results about cycle spectra, and provides
evidence that faces of size five may obstruct long cycles in many graph classes. We test our motor
on the following conjecture about essentially 4-connected graphs. A planar graph is \emph{essentially
$4$-connected} if it is 3-connected and every of its 3-separators is the neighborhood of a single
vertex. Jackson and Wormald proved that every essentially 4-connected planar graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
contains a cycle of length at least $\frac{2}{5}(n+2)$, and this result has recently been improved
multiple times, culminating in the lower bound $\frac{5}{8}(n+2)$. However, the currently best
known upper bound is given by an infinite family of such graphs in which no graph $G$ contains a cycle
that is longer than $\left \lfloor \frac{2}{3}(n+4) \right \rfloor$; this upper bound is still
unmatched. Using isolating cycles, we improve the lower bound to match the upper. All our results
are tight.
