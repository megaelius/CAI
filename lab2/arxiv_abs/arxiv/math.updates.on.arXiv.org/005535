We present and thoroughly study natural Polish spaces of separable Banach spaces. These spaces
are defined as spaces of norms, resp. pseudonorms on the countable infinite-dimensional rational
vector space. We provide an exhaustive comparison of these spaces with the admissible topologies
recently introduced by Godefroy and Saint-Raymond and show that Borel complexities differ little
with respect to these two different topological approaches. We then focus mainly on the Borel complexities
of isometry classes of the most classical Banach spaces. We prove that the infinite-dimensional
Hilbert space is characterized as the unique separable infinite-dimensional Banach space whose
isometry class is closed, and also as the unique separable infinite-dimensional Banach space whose
isomorphism class is $F_\sigma$. For $p\in\left[1,2\right)\cup\left(2,\infty\right)$, we
show that the isometry classes of $L_p[0,1]$ and $\ell_p$ are $G_\delta$-complete and $F_{\sigma\delta}$-complete,
respectively. Then we show that the isometry class of the Gurari\u{\i} space is $G_\delta$-complete
and the isometry class of $c_0$ is $F_{\sigma\delta}$-complete. The isometry class of the former
space is moreover proved to be dense $G_\delta$. Additionally, we compute the complexities of many
other natural classes of Banach spaces; for instance, $\mathcal{L}_{p,\lambda+}$-spaces, for
$p,\lambda\geq 1$, are shown to be $G_\delta$, superreflexive spaces are shown to be $F_{\sigma\delta}$,
and spaces with local $\Pi$-basis structure are shown to be $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^0_6$. The paper
is concluded with many open problems and suggestions for a future research.
