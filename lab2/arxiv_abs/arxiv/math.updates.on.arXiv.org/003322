The generalised Gegenbauer functions of fractional degree (GGF-Fs), denoted by ${}^{r\!}G^{(\lambda)}_\nu(x)$
(right GGF-Fs) and ${}^{l}G^{(\lambda)}_\nu(x)$ (left GGF-Fs) with $x\in (-1,1),$ $\lambda>-1/2$
and real $\nu\ge 0,$ are special functions (usually non-polynomials), which are defined upon the
hypergeometric representation of the classical Gegenbauer polynomial by allowing integer degree
to be real fractional degree. Remarkably, the GGF-Fs become indispensable for optimal error estimates
of polynomial approximation to singular functions, and have intimate relations with several families
of nonstandard basis functions recently introduced for solving fractional differential equations.
However, some properties of GGF-Fs, which are important pieces for the analysis and applications,
are unknown or under explored. The purposes of this paper are twofold. The first is to show that for
$\lambda,\nu>0$ and $x=\cos\theta$ with $\theta\in (0,\pi),$ \begin{equation*}\label{IntRep-0N}
(\sin \varphi)^{\lambda}\,{}^{r\!}G_\nu^{(\lambda)}(\cos \varphi)= \frac{2^\lambda\Gamma(\lambda+1/2)}{\sqrt{\pi}
{(\nu+\lambda)^{\lambda}}} \, {\cos ((\nu+\lambda)\varphi- \lambda\pi/2)} +{\mathcal R}_\nu^{(\lambda)}
(\varphi), \end{equation*} and derive the precise expression of the "residual" term ${\mathcal
R}_\nu^{(\lambda)} (\varphi).$ With this at our disposal, we obtain the bounds of GGF-Fs uniform
in $\nu.$ Under an appropriate weight function, the bounds are uniform for $\theta\in [0,\pi]$
as well. Moreover, we can study the asymptotics of GGF-Fs with large fractional degree $\nu.$ The
second is to present miscellaneous properties of GGF-Fs for better understanding of this family
of useful special functions.
