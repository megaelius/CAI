We use cluster structures and mirror symmetry to explicitly describe a natural class of Newton-Okounkov
bodies for Grassmannians. We consider the Grassmannian $X=Gr_{n-k}(\mathbb C^n)$, as well as
the mirror dual Landau-Ginzburg model $(\check{X}^\circ, W_q:\check{X}^\circ \to \mathbb C)$,
where $\check{X}^\circ$ is the complement of a particular anti-canonical divisor in a Langlands
dual Grassmannian $\check{X} = Gr_k((\mathbb C^n)^*)$, and the superpotential W_q has a simple
expression in terms of Pl\"ucker coordinates. Grassmannians simultaneously have the structure
of an $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety and an $\mathcal{X}$-cluster variety. Given a cluster seed
G, we consider two associated coordinate systems: a $\mathcal X$-cluster chart $\Phi_G:(\mathbb
C^*)^{k(n-k)}\to X^{\circ}$ and a $\mathcal A$-cluster chart $\Phi_G^{\vee}:(\mathbb C^*)^{k(n-k)}\to
\check{X}^\circ$. To each $\mathcal X$-cluster chart $\Phi_G$ and ample `boundary divisor' $D$
in $X\setminus X^{\circ}$, we associate a Newton-Okounkov body $\Delta_G(D)$ in $\mathbb R^{k(n-k)}$,
which is defined as the convex hull of rational points. On the other hand using the $\mathcal A$-cluster
chart $\Phi_G^{\vee}$ on the mirror side, we obtain a set of rational polytopes, described by inequalities,
by writing the superpotential $W_q$ in the $\mathcal A$-cluster coordinates, and then "tropicalising".
Our main result is that the Newton-Okounkov bodies $\Delta_G(D)$ and the polytopes obtained by
tropicalisation coincide. As an application, we construct degenerations of the Grassmannian
to toric varieties corresponding to these Newton-Okounkov bodies. Additionally, when $G$ corresponds
to a plabic graph, we give a formula for the lattice points of the Newton-Okounkov bodies, which has
an interpretation in terms of quantum Schubert calculus.
