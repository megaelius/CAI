Functional data analysis is typically conducted within the $L^2$-Hilbert space framework. There
is by now a fully developed statistical toolbox allowing for the principled application of the functional
data machinery to real-world problems, often based on dimension reduction techniques such as functional
principal component analysis. At the same time, there have recently been a number of publications
that sidestep dimension reduction steps and focus on a fully functional $L^2$-methodology. This
paper goes one step further and develops data analysis methodology for functional time series in
the space of all continuous functions. The work is motivated by the fact that objects with rather
different shapes may still have a small $L^2$-distance and are therefore identified as similar
when using an $L^2$-metric. However, in applications it is often desirable to use metrics reflecting
the visualization of the curves in the statistical analysis. The methodological contributions
are focused on developing two-sample and change-point tests as well as confidence bands, as these
procedures appear do be conducive to the proposed setting. Particular interest is put on relevant
differences; that is, on not trying to test for exact equality, but rather for pre-specified deviations
under the null hypothesis. The procedures are justified through large-sample theory. To ensure
practicability, non-standard bootstrap procedures are developed and investigated addressing
particular features that arise in the problem of testing relevant hypotheses. The finite sample
properties are explored through a simulation study and an application to annual temperature profiles.
