We present a method for optimal control of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs)
with uncertain parameter fields. We consider an objective function that involves the mean and variance
of the control objective, leading to a risk-averse optimal control problem. To make the problem
tractable, we invoke a quadratic Taylor series approximation of the control objective with respect
to the uncertain parameter. This enables deriving explicit expressions for the mean and variance
of the control objective in terms of its gradients and Hessians with respect to the uncertain parameter.
The risk-averse optimal control problem is then formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization
problem with constraints given by the forward and adjoint PDEs defining these gradients and Hessians.
The expressions for the mean and variance of the control objective under the quadratic approximation
involve the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian and are thus prohibitive to evaluate. To address
this, we employ trace estimators that only require a modest number of Hessian-vector products.
We illustrate our approach with two problems: the control of a semilinear elliptic PDE with an uncertain
boundary source term, and the control of a linear elliptic PDE with an uncertain coefficient field.
For the latter problem, we derive adjoint-based expressions for efficient computation of the gradient
of the risk-averse objective with respect to the controls. Our method ensures that the cost of computing
the risk-averse objective and its gradient with respect to the control, measured in the number of
PDE solves, is independent of the (discretized) parameter and control dimensions, and depends
only on the number of random vectors employed in the trace estimation. Finally, we present a comprehensive
numerical study of an optimal control problem for fluid flow in a porous medium with uncertain permeability
field.
