We introduce an interacting particle system of vegetation dynamics and show its convergence towards
a generalized, spatially extended Staver-Levin model in an appropriate scaling limit. The proof
of convergence relies on coupling techniques for stochastic jump processes, and allows the derivation
of limiting dynamics for macro-scale (finite patch locations) and mesoscale (continuous vegetation
cover) models. The limiting equations are McKean-Vlasov jump processes - processes solving stochastic
differential equations with self-consistent jump rates depending on the law of the solution. The
generalized Kolmogorov equations of these processes in a macroscopic setting with one patch are
precisely the classical Staver-Levin model, and, in spatial settings, the Kolmogorov equations
constitute a nonlocal integro-differential extension of the classical model. These results have
a number of theoretical and ecological consequences. In particular, our models provide an elementary
example of jump processes that do not converge to a stationary distribution but rather oscillate
in law. The mesoscale particle system can incorporate environmental heterogeneity, allowing
us to exhibit solutions presenting waves of invasion and front pinning. Remarkably, the dynamical
behavior of the particle systems finely recovers the bifurcation structure of the mean-field limit.
To understand this consistency, despite almost-sure absorption in finite-size particle systems,
we computed the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) and derived the absorption probability as
a function of parameters. The QSD matches the bifurcation diagram of the corresponding ODE closely
and is especially relevant for the system dynamics since the absorption probability drops sharply
to zero as nontrivial equilibria emerge in the corresponding ODE.
