We consider caching in cellular networks in which each base station is equipped with a cache that
can store a limited number of files. The popularity of the files is known and the goal is to place files
in the caches such that the probability that a user at an arbitrary location in the plane will find
the file that she requires in one of the covering caches is maximized. We develop distributed asynchronous
algorithms for deciding which contents to store in which cache. Such cooperative algorithms require
communication only between caches with overlapping coverage areas and can operate in asynchronous
manner. The development of the algorithms is principally based on an observation that the problem
can be viewed as a potential game. Our basic algorithm is derived from the best response dynamics.
We demonstrate that the complexity of each best response step is independent of the number of files,
linear in the cache capacity and linear in the maximum number of base stations that cover a certain
area. Then, we show that the overall algorithm complexity for a discrete cache placement is polynomial
in both network size and catalog size. In practical examples, the algorithm converges in just a few
iterations. Also, in most cases of interest, the basic algorithm finds the best Nash equilibrium
corresponding to the global optimum. We provide two extensions of our basic algorithm based on stochastic
and deterministic simulated annealing which find the global optimum. Finally, we demonstrate
the hit probability evolution on real and synthetic networks numerically and show that our distributed
caching algorithm performs significantly better than storing the most popular content, probabilistic
content placement policy and Multi-LRU caching policies.
