For $2$ vectors $x\in \mathbb{R}^m$, we use the notation $x * y =(x_1y_1,\ldots ,x_my_m)$, and if
$x=y$ we also use the notation $x^2=x*x$ and $x^3=(x*x)*x$. We use $<,>$ for the usual inner product
on $\mathbb{R}^m$. For $A$ an $m\times m$ matrix with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}$, we can assign
a map $F_A(x)=x+(Ax)^3:~\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$. A matrix $A$ is Druzkowski
iff $det(JF_A(x))=1$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^m$. Recently, Jiang Liu posted a preprint on arXiv
asserting the following: (i) The Jacobian conjecture can be reduced to injectiveness of the above
maps $F_A(x)$ when $A$ is Druzkowski; (ii) The injectiveness of $F_A(x)$ can, via Hadamard's theorem,
reduces to the properness (requiring the inverse of compact sets to be compact) of $F_A(x)$; (iii)
When $A$ is Druzkowski, then the properness of $F_A(x)$ can be obtained via using some inequalities
in the real numbers. We have been trying to checked the above preprint, but cannot yet confirm the
correctness of the preprint. In the proof of (iii) above, indeed Liu showed the properness of $F_A(x)$
under more general conditions on $A$, see the main body of this paper for more detail. This makes us
wonder to what extend would the maps $F_A(x)$ are proper, and to our surprise almost all matrices
$A$ satisfy this property. Here is the main result of this paper. {\bf Main Theorem:} $F_A(x)$ is
proper if one of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) $A$ is invertible. (2) $A$ is symmetric.
(3) $A$ has rank $1$. (4) $A$ is an upper triangular matrix such that all $0$-entries are positioned
last on the diagonal (see the main body of this paper for a precise definition). (5) $F_B(x)$ is proper,
where $B=DAD^{-3}$ for an invertible {\bf diagonal} matrix $D$.
