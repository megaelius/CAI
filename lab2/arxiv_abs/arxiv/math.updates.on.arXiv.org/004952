We study optimal delivery strategies of one common and $K$ independent messages from a source to
multiple users in wireless environments. In particular, two-layered superposition of broadcast/multicast
and unicast signals is considered in a downlink multiuser OFDMA system. In the literature and industry,
the two-layer superposition is often considered as a pragmatic approach to make a compromise between
the simple but suboptimal orthogonal multiplexing (OM) and the optimal but complex fully-layered
non-orthogonal multiplexing. In this work, we show that only two-layers are necessary to achieve
the maximum sum-rate when the common message has higher priority than the $K$ individual unicast
messages, and OM cannot be sum-rate optimal in general. We develop an algorithm that finds the optimal
power allocation over the two-layers and across the OFDMA radio resources in static channels and
a class of fading channels. Two main use-cases are considered: i) Multicast and unicast multiplexing
when $K$ users with uplink capabilities request both common and independent messages, and ii) broadcast
and unicast multiplexing when the common message targets receive-only devices and $K$ users with
uplink capabilities additionally request independent messages. Finally, we develop a transceiver
design for broadcast/multicast and unicast superposition transmission based on LTE-A-Pro physical
layer and show with numerical evaluations in mobile environments with multipath propagation that
the capacity improvements can be translated into significant practical performance gains compared
to the orthogonal schemes in the 3GPP specifications. We also analyze the impact of real channel
estimation and show that significant gains in terms of spectral efficiency or coverage area are
still available even with estimation errors and imperfect interference cancellation for the two-layered
superposition system.
