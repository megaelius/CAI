Consider a general linear Hamiltonian system $\partial_{t}u=JLu$ in a Hilbert space $X$. We assume
that$\ L: X \to X^{*}$ induces a bounded and symmetric bi-linear form $\left\langle L\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle
$ on $X$, which has only finitely many negative dimensions $n^{-}(L)$. There is no restriction on
the anti-self-dual operator $J: X^{*} \supset D(J) \to X$. We first obtain a structural decomposition
of $X$ into the direct sum of several closed subspaces so that $L$ is blockwise diagonalized and $JL$
is of upper triangular form, where the blocks are easier to handle. Based on this structure, we first
prove the linear exponential trichotomy of $e^{tJL}$. In particular, $e^{tJL}$ has at most algebraic
growth in the finite co-dimensional center subspace. Next we prove an instability index theorem
to relate $n^{-}\left( L\right) $ and the dimensions of generalized eigenspaces of eigenvalues
of$\ JL$, some of which may be embedded in the continuous spectrum. This generalizes and refines
previous results, where mostly $J$ was assumed to have a bounded inverse. More explicit information
for the indexes with pure imaginary eigenvalues are obtained as well. Moreover, when Hamiltonian
perturbations are considered, we give a sharp condition for the structural instability regarding
the generation of unstable spectrum from the imaginary axis. Finally, we discuss Hamiltonian PDEs
including dispersive long wave models (BBM, KDV and good Boussinesq equations), 2D Euler equation
for ideal fluids, and 2D nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with nonzero condition at infinity,
where our general theory applies to yield stability or instability of some coherent states.
