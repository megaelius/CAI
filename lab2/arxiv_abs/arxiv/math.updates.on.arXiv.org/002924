Shamir's celebrated secret sharing scheme provides an efficient method for encoding a secret of
arbitrary length $\ell$ among any $N \leq 2^\ell$ players such that for a threshold parameter $t$,
(i) the knowledge of any $t$ shares does not reveal any information about the secret and, (ii) any
choice of $t+1$ shares fully reveals the secret. It is known that any such threshold secret sharing
scheme necessarily requires shares of length $\ell$, and in this sense Shamir's scheme is optimal.
The relaxed notion of ramp schemes requires the reconstruction of secret from any $t+1+g$ shares,
for a gap parameter $g>0$. Ramp secret sharing is possible with share lengths depending only on the
gap ratio $g/N$. In this work, we study secret sharing in the extremal case of bit-long shares, where
even ramp secret sharing becomes impossible. We show, however, that a slightly relaxed but equally
effective notion of semantic security for the secret, and negligible reconstruction error probability,
eliminates the impossibility. Moreover, we provide explicit constructions of such schemes. Our
relaxation results in separation of adaptive and non-adaptive adversaries. For non-adaptive
adversaries, we explicitly construct secret sharing schemes that provide secrecy against any
$\tau$ fraction of observed shares, and reconstruction from any $\kappa$ fraction of shares, for
any choices of $0 \leq \tau < \kappa \leq 1$. Our construction achieves secret length $N(\kappa-\tau-o(1))$
which we show to be optimal. Finally, we construct explicit schemes against adaptive adversaries
attaining a secret length $\Omega(N(\kappa-\tau))$. Our work makes a new connection between secret
sharing and coding theory, this time wiretap codes, that was not known before, and raises new interesting
open questions.
