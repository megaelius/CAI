This thesis studies instabilities and singularities in a geometrical approach to the planar 3-body
problem as well as instabilities, chaos and ergodicity in the 3-rotor problem. Trajectories of
the planar 3-body problem are expressed as geodesics of the Jacobi-Maupertuis (JM) metric on the
configuration space $C^3$. Translation, rotation and scaling isometries lead to reduced dynamics
on quotients of $C^3$ that encode information on the full dynamics. Riemannian submersions are
used to find the quotient metrics and to show that the geodesic formulation regularizes collisions
for the $1/r^2$ but not for the $1/r$ potential. Extending work of Montgomery, we show the negativity
of the scalar curvature on the center of mass configuration space and certain quotients for equal
masses and zero energy. Sectional curvatures are also found to be largely negative indicating widespread
geodesic instabilities. In the 3-rotor problem, 3 equal masses move on a circle subject to attractive
cosine inter-particle potentials. This problem arises as the classical limit of a model of coupled
Josephson junctions. The energy E serves as a control parameter. We find analogues of the Euler-Lagrange
family of periodic solutions: pendula and breathers at all E and choreographies up to moderate E.
The model displays order-chaos-order behavior and undergoes a fairly sharp transition to chaos
at a critical energy E$_c$ with several manifestations: (a) a dramatic rise in the fraction of Poincar\'e
surfaces occupied by chaotic sections, (b) spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries, (c) a
geometric cascade of stability transitions in pendula and (d) a change in the sign of the JM curvature.
Poincar\'e sections indicate global chaos in a band of energies slightly above E$_c$ where we provide
evidence for ergodicity and mixing with respect to the Liouville measure and study the statistics
of recurrence times.
