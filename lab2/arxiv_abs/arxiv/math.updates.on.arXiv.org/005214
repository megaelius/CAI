This paper considers the problem of Quantitative Group Testing (QGT) where there are some defective
items among a large population of $N$ items. We consider the scenario in which each item is defective
with probability $K/N$, independently from the other items. In the QGT problem, the goal is to identify
all or a sufficiently large fraction of the defective items by testing groups of items, with the minimum
possible number of tests. In particular, the outcome of each test is a non-negative integer which
indicates the number of defective items in the tested group. In this work, we propose a non-adaptive
QGT scheme for the underlying randomized model for defective items, which utilizes sparse graph
codes over irregular bipartite graphs with optimized degree profiles on the left nodes of the graph
as well as binary $t$-error-correcting BCH codes. We show that in the sub-linear regime, i.e., when
the ratio $K/N$ vanishes as $N$ grows unbounded, the proposed scheme with ${m=c(t,d)K(t\log (\frac{\ell
N}{c(t,d)K}+1)+1)}$ tests can identify all the defective items with probability approaching
$1$, where $d$ and $\ell$ are the maximum and average left degree, respectively, and $c(t,d)$ depends
only on $t$ and $d$ (and does not depend on $K$ and $N$). For any $t\leq 4$, the testing and recovery
algorithms of the proposed scheme have the computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log \frac{N}{K})$
and $\mathcal{O}(K\log \frac{N}{K})$, respectively. The proposed scheme outperforms two recently
proposed non-adaptive QGT schemes for the sub-linear regime, including our scheme based on regular
bipartite graphs and the scheme of Gebhard et al., in terms of the number of tests required to identify
all defective items with high probability.
