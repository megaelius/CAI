We discuss the design of interlayer edges in a multiplex network, under a limited budget, with the
goal of improving its overall performance. We analyze the following three problems separately;
first, we maximize the smallest nonzero eigenvalue, also known as the algebraic connectivity;
secondly, we minimize the largest eigenvalue, also known as the spectral radius; and finally, we
minimize the spectral width. Maximizing the algebraic connectivity requires identical weights
on the interlayer edges for budgets less than a threshold value. However, for larger budgets, the
optimal weights are generally non-uniform. The dual formulation transforms the problem into a
graph realization (embedding) problem that allows us to give a fuller picture. Namely, before the
threshold budget, the optimal realization is one-dimensional with nodes in the same layer embedded
to a single point; while, beyond the threshold, the optimal embeddings generally unfold into spaces
with dimension bounded by the multiplicity of the algebraic connectivity. Finally, for extremely
large budgets the embeddings revert again to lower dimensions. Minimizing the largest eigenvalue
is driven by the spectral radius of the individual networks and its corresponding eigenvector.
Before a threshold, the total budget is distributed among interlayer edges corresponding to the
nodal lines of this eigenvector, and the optimal largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian remains constant.
For larger budgets, the weight distribution tends to be almost uniform. In the dual picture, the
optimal graph embedding is one-dimensional and non-homogeneous at first and beyond this threshold,
the optimal embedding expands to be multi-dimensional, and for larger values of the budget, the
two layers fill the embedding space. Finally, we show how these two problems are connected to minimizing
the spectral width.
