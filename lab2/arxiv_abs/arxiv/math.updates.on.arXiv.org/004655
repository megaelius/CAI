Let $\mathbb{A}[n]$ be the group of $n$-torsion points of a commutative algebraic group $\mathbb{A}$
defined over a number field $F$. For a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$ that is unramified in $F(\mathbb{A}[n])/F$,
we let $N_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mathbb{A}[n])$ be the number of $\mathbb{F}_\mathfrak{p}$-solutions
of the system of polynomial equations defining $\mathbb{A}[n]$ when reduced modulo $\mathfrak{p}$.
Here, $\mathbb{F}_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is the residue field at $\mathfrak{p}$. Let $\pi_F(x)$ denote
the number of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$ whose norm $N(\mathfrak{p})$ do not exceed $x$.
We then, for algebraic groups of dimension one, compute the $k$-th moment limit $$M_k(\mathbb{A}/F,
n)=\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\pi_F(x)} \sum_{N(\mathfrak{p}) \leq x} N_{\mathfrak{p}}^k(\mathbb{A}[n])$$
by appealing to the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions and more generally the Chebotarev
density theorem. We further interpret this limit as the number of orbits of ${\rm Gal}(F(\mathbb{A}[n])/F)$
acting on $k$ copies of $\mathbb{A}[n]$ by another application of the Chebotarev density theorem.
These concrete examples suggest a possible approach for determining the number of orbits of a group
acting on $k$ copies of a set. More precisely, we study the number of orbits of an arithmetically realizable
action of a finite group $G$ on the product of $k$ copies of a finite set $X$. (By an arithmetically
realizable action, we mean an action that can be realized as an action of the Galois group of a certain
extension on the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations defined over a number field.)
We prove a general result and provide several concrete examples.
