The dynamical stability of solitary lattice waves in non-integrable FPUT chains is a longstanding
open problem and has been solved so far only in a certain asymptotic regime, namely by Friesecke and
Pego for the KdV limit, in which the waves propagate with near sonic speed, have large wave length,
and carry low energy. In this paper we derive a similar result in a complementary asymptotic regime
related to fast and strongly localized waves with high energy. In particular, we show that the spectrum
of the linearized FPUT operator contains asymptotically no unstable eigenvalues except for the
neutral ones that stem from the shift symmetry and the spatial discreteness. This ensures that high-energy
waves are linearly stable in some orbital sense, and the corresponding nonlinear stability is granted
by the general, non-asymptotic part of the seminal Friesecke-Pego result and the extension by Mizumachi.
Our analytical work splits into two principal parts. First we refine two-scale techniques that
relate high-energy wave to a nonlinear asymptotic shape ODE and provide accurate approximation
formulas. In this way we establish the existence, local uniqueness, smooth parameter dependence,
and exponential localization of fast lattice waves for a wide class of interaction potentials with
algebraic singularity. Afterwards we study the crucial eigenvalue problem in exponentially weighted
spaces, so that there is no unstable essential spectrum. Our key argument is that all proper eigenfunctions
can asymptotically be linked to the unique bounded and normalized solution of the linearized shape
ODE, and this finally enables us to disprove the existence of unstable eigenfunctions in the symplectic
complement of the neutral ones.
