Extended formulation of Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), called Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion
(WRI), offers potential benefits of decreasing the nonlinearity of the inverse problem by replacing
the explicit inverse of the ill-conditioned wave-equation operator of classical FWI (the oscillating
Green functions) with a suitably defined data-driven regularized inverse. This regularization
relaxes the wave-equation constraint to reconstruct wavefields that match the data, hence mitigating
the risk of cycle skipping. The subsurface model parameters are then updated in a direction which
reduces these constraint violations. However, in the case of a rough initial model, the phase errors
in the reconstructed wavefields may trap the waveform inversion in a local minimum leading to inaccurate
subsurface models. In this paper, in order to avoid matching such incorrect phase information during
the early WRI iterations, we design a new cost function based upon phase retrieval, namely a process
which seeks to reconstruct a signal from the amplitude of linear measurements. This new formulation,
called Wavefield Inversion with Phase Retrieval (WIPR), further improves the robustness of the
parameter estimation subproblem by a suitable phase correction. We implement the resulting WIPR
problem with an alternating-direction approach, which combines the Majorization-Minimization
(MM) algorithm to linearize the phase-retrieval term and a variable splitting technique based
upon the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This new workflow equipped with TT
regularization, which is the combination of total-variation and second-order Tikhonov regularizations,
and bound constraints successfully reconstructs the BP salt model from a sparse fixed-spread acquisition
using a 3 Hz starting frequency and a homogeneous initial velocity model.
