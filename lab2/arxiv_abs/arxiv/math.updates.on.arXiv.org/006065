Spatial modulation (SM) is a new paradigm of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in
which only one antenna at the transmitter is activated during each symbol period. Recently, it is
observed that SM training sequences derived from corss Z-complementary pairs (CZCPs) lead to optimal
channel estimation performance over frequency-selective channels. CZCPs are special form of
sequence pairs which have zero aperiodic autocorrelation zones and cross-correlation zone at
certain time-shifts. Recent paper by Liu \textit{et al.} discussed only perfect CZCPs. In this
paper, we focus on non-perfect CZCPs. We introduce the term cross Z-complementary ratio and re-categorise
the CZCPs, both perfect and non-perfect, based on that. We propose a systematic construction of
CZCPs based on generalised Boolean functions (GBFs). We further extend the lengths of the CZCPs
by using the insertion method. The proposed CZCPs are all of new lengths of the form $2^\alpha10^\beta26^\gamma+2~(\alpha\geq1)$,
$10^\beta+2$, $26^\gamma+2$ and $10^\beta 26^\gamma+2$. Finally we propose a construction of
optimal binary CZCPs having parameters $(12,5)$ and $(24,11)$ from binary Barker sequences. These
CZCPs are also extended to $(12N,5N)$- CZCPs and $(24N,11N)$- CZCPs, where $N$ is the length of a
binary Golay complementary pair (GCP). During the proof, we also found a new structural property
of binary CZCPs and concluded all binary GCPs are CZCPs too. Finally, we give some numerical simulations
to confirm that depending on the number of multi-paths, the proposed CZCPs can be used to design SM
training matrix which attains the minimum mean square error.
