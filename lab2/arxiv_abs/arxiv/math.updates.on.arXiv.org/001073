Let M be the ring of m x n matrices A with entries in R=K[[x1,...,xs]], the ring of formal power series
over an arbitrary field K. We call A finitely determined if any matrix B, with entries of A-B in <x1,...,xs>^k
for some k, is left-right equivalent to A, i.e. B is contained in the G-orbit of A, where G is the group
of automorphisms of R combined with the multiplication of invertible matrices from the left and
from the right. Finite determinacy is an important property, which implies that A is left-right
equivalent to a matrix with polynomial entries. It has been intensively studied for one power series
over the complex and real numbers in connection with the classification of singularities. In positive
characteristic the problem is more subtle since the tangent image may differ from the tangent space
to the orbit, as was shown in one of our previous papers. There we show that finite codimension of the
tangent image is sufficient for finite determinacy. The question whether it is also necessary remains
open for matrices of arbitrary size in positive characteristic. In this paper we answer this question
positively for 1-column matrices. For this we prove that the Fitting ideals of a finitely determined
matrix have maximal height. 1-column matrices are of particular interest, since left-right equivalence
of matrices corresponds to contact equivalence of the ideals in R generated by their entries. Here
two ideals I and J are contact equivalent if the K-algebras R/I and R/J are isomorphic. Our main result
on matrices implies that a positive dimensional ideal is finitely contact-determined if and only
if it is an isolated complete intersection singularity. In addition we give explicitly computable
and semicontinuous determinacy bounds. We discuss also several open problems which are of independent
interest.
