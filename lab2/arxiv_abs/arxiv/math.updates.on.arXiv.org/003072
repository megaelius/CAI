Scaling transformations involving a small parameter ({\em degenerate scalings}) are frequently
used for ordinary differential equations that model (bio-) chemical reaction networks. They are
motivated by quasi-steady state (QSS) of certain chemical species, and ideally lead to slow-fast
systems for singular perturbation reductions, in the sense of Tikhonov and Fenichel. In the present
paper we discuss properties of such scaling transformations, with regard to their applicability
as well as to their determination. Transformations of this type are admissible only when certain
consistency conditions are satisfied, and they lead to singular perturbation scenarios only if
additional conditions hold, including a further consistency condition on initial values. Given
these consistency conditions, two scenarios occur. The first (which we call standard) is well known
and corresponds to a classical quasi-steady state (QSS) reduction. Here, scaling may actually
be omitted because there exists a singular perturbation reduction for the unscaled system, with
a coordinate subspace as critical manifold. For the second (nonstandard) scenario scaling is crucial.
Here one may obtain a singular perturbation reduction with the slow manifold having dimension greater
than expected from the scaling. For parameter dependent systems we consider the problem to find
all possible scalings, and we show that requiring the consistency conditions allows their determination.
This lays the groundwork for algorithmic approaches, to be taken up in future work. In the final section
we consider some applications. In particular we discuss relevant nonstandard reductions of certain
reaction-transport systems.
