We analyze a class of cell-bulk coupled PDE-ODE models, motivated by quorum and diffusion sensing
phenomena in microbial systems, that characterize communication between localized spatially
segregated dynamically active signaling compartments that have a permeable boundary. Each cell
secretes a signaling chemical into the bulk region at a constant rate and receives a feedback of the
bulk chemical from the entire collection of cells. This global feedback, which activates signaling
pathways within the cells, modifies the intracellular dynamics according to the external environment.
The cell secretion and global feedback are regulated by permeability parameters across the cell
membrane. For arbitrary reaction-kinetics within each cell, the method of matched asymptotic
expansions is used in the limit of small cell radius to construct steady-state solutions of the PDE-ODE
model, and to derive a globally coupled nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem (GCEP) that characterizes
the linear stability properties of the steady-states. In the limit of large bulk diffusivity an
asymptotic analysis of the PDE-ODE model leads to a limiting ODE system for the spatial average of
the concentration in the bulk region that is coupled to the intracellular dynamics within the cells.
Results from the linear stability theory and ODE dynamics are illustrated for Sel'kov reaction-kinetics,
where the kinetic parameters are chosen so that each cell is quiescent when uncoupled from the bulk
medium. For various specific spatial configurations of cells, the linear stability theory is used
to construct phase diagrams in parameter space characterizing where a switch-like emergence of
intracellular oscillations can occur through a Hopf bifurcation.
