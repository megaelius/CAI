Large Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants are often employed in order to feed district heating networks,
in Europe, in post soviet countries and China. Traditionally they have been operated following
the thermal load with the electric energy considered as a by-product, while the modern trend includes
them in the electric market to take advantage of the flexibility they could provide. This implies
the necessity to consider the impact on the electric grid while filling the thermal load requests.
A detailed Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model for the solution of the network-constrained
CHP unit commitment of the day-ahead operation is introduced. The developed model accounts for
lossless DC network approximation of the electric power flow constraints, as well as a detailed
characterization of the CHP units with useful effect, heat and power, function of one and two independent
variables ("degrees-of-freedom"), and thermal energy storage. A computational validation of
the outlined model on a CHP test system with multiple heating zones is presented in the form of computational
test cases. The test cases illustrate the impact on the flexibility of the implementation of the
energy storage, network constraints and joint multi-system operation. The conducted studies
have highlighted the importance of a comprehensive and integrated analysis of multi-energy systems
to exploit the operational flexibility provided by the cogeneration units. The joint operation
of the thermal and electric system allows to reap economic, operational efficiency, and environmental
benefits. The developed model can be easily extended to include diverse multi-energy systems and
technologies, as well as more complex representations of the energy transmission networks, and
the modeling of renewable energy resources dependent of one or more independent, weather-related,
variables.
