We give a definitive treatment of duality for optimal consumption over the infinite horizon, in
a semimartingale incomplete market satisfying no unbounded profit with bounded risk (NUPBR).
Rather than base the dual domain on (local) martingale deflators, we use a class of supermartingale
deflators such that deflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a supermartingale
for all admissible consumption plans. This yields a strong duality, because the enlarged dual domain
of processes dominated by deflators is naturally closed, without invoking its closure. In this
way we automatically reach the bipolar of the set of deflators. We complete this picture by proving
that the set of processes dominated by local martingale deflators is dense in our dual domain, confirming
that we have identified the natural dual space. In addition to the optimal consumption and deflator,
we characterise the optimal wealth process. At the optimum, deflated wealth is a supermartingale
and a potential, while deflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a uniformly integrable
martingale. This is the natural generalisation of the corresponding feature in the terminal wealth
problem, where deflated wealth at the optimum is a uniformly integrable martingale. We use no constructions
involving equivalent local martingale measures. This is natural, given that such measures typically
do not exist over the infinite horizon and that we are working under NUPBR, which does not require
their existence. The structure of the duality proof reveals an interesting feature compared with
the terminal wealth problem. There, the dual domain is $L^{1}$-bounded, but here the primal domain
has this property, and hence many steps in the duality proof show a marked reversal of roles for the
primal and dual domains, compared with the proofs of Kramkov and Schachermayer.
