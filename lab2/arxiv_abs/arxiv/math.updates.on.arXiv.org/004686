Given a Schauder basic sequence $(x_k)$ in a Banach lattice, we say that $(x_k)$ is bibasic if the
expansion of every vector in $[x_k]$ converges not only in norm, but also in order. We prove that,
in this definition, order convergence may be replaced with uniform convergence, with order boundedness
of the partial sums, or with norm boundedness of finite suprema of the partial sums. The results in
this paper extend and unify those from the pioneering paper "Order Schauder bases in Banach lattices"
by A.Gumenchuk et al. In particular, we are able to characterize bibasic sequences in terms of the
bibasis inequality, a result they obtained under certain additional assumptions. We then embark
on a deeper study of their properties. We show that they are independent of ambient space, stable
under small perturbations, and preserved under sequentially uniformly continuous norm isomorphic
embeddings. We consider several special kinds of bibasic sequences, including permutable sequences,
i.e., sequences for which every permutation is bibasic, and absolute sequences, i.e., sequences
where expansions remain convergent after we replace every term with its modulus. We provide several
equivalent characterizations of absolute sequences, showing how they relate to bibases and to
further modifications of the basis inequality. We further consider bibasic sequences with unique
order expansions. We show that this property does generally depend on ambient space, but not for
the inclusion of $c_0$ into $\ell_\infty$. We also show that small perturbations of bibases with
unique order expansions have unique order expansions, but this is not true if "bibases" is replaced
with "bibasic sequences". Finally, we consider uo-bibasic sequences, which are obtained by replacing
order convergence with uo-convergence in the definition of a bibasic sequence. We show that such
sequences are very common.
