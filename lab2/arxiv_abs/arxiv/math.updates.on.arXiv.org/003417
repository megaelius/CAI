This paper is concerned with uniqueness, phase retrieval and shape reconstruction methods for
inverse elastic scattering problems with phaseless far field data. Systematically, we study two
basic models, i.e., inverse scattering of plane waves by rigid bodies and inverse scattering of
sources with compact support. For both models, we show that the location of the objects can not be
uniquely recovered by the data. To solve this problem, we consider simultaneously the incident
point sources with one fixed source point and at most three scattering strengths. We then establish
some uniqueness results for source scattering problem with multi-frequency phaseless far field
data. Furthermore, a fast and stable phase retrieval approach is proposed based on a simple geometric
result which provides a stable reconstruction of a point in the plane from three distances to given
points. Difficulties arise for inverse scattering by rigid bodies due to the additional unknown
far field pattern of the point sources. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an artificial
rigid body into the system and show that the underlying rigid bodies can be uniquely determined by
the corresponding phaseless far field data at a fixed frequency. Noting that the far field pattern
of the scattered field corresponding to point sources is very small if the source point is far away
from the scatterers, we propose an appropriate phase retrieval method for obstacle scattering
problems, without using the artificial rigid body. Finally, we propose several sampling methods
for shape reconstruction with phaseless far field data. Extended numerical examples in two dimensions
are conducted with noisy data, and the results further verify the effectiveness and robustness
of the proposed phase retrieval techniques and sampling methods.
