We derive exact and asymptotic results for random partitions from general results in the semi-classical
analysis of coherent states applied to the classical periodic Benjamin-Ono equation at critical
regularity $s= -1/2$. We find classical $dF_{\star |v} (c| \overline{\varepsilon})$ and quantum
$d\hat{F}^{\eta_{NS}}( c | \hbar, \overline{\varepsilon})|_{\Psi}$ conserved densities for
this system with dispersion coefficient $\overline{\varepsilon}$ extending Nazarov-Sklyanin
(2013). For quantum stationary states, this conserved density is $dF_{\lambda}(c | \varepsilon_2,
\varepsilon_1)$ the Rayleigh measure of the profile of a partition $\lambda$ of anisotropy $(\varepsilon_2,
\varepsilon_1) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ for $\hbar = - \varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2$, $\overline{\varepsilon}=
\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2$ invariant under $\varepsilon_2 \longleftrightarrow \varepsilon_1$.
As Jack polynomials are the quantum stationary states and Stanley's Cauchy kernel (1989) is the
reproducing kernel, the random values of the quantum periodic Benjamin-Ono hierarchy in a coherent
state $\Upsilon_v ( \cdot | \hbar)$ are a "Jack measure" on partitions, a dispersive generalization
of Okounkov's Schur measures (1999). By our general results for coherent states, we have concentration
on a limit shape as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$, the classical conserved density at $v$, and quantum fluctuations
are an explicit Gaussian field. Our results follow from an enumerative asymptotic expansion in
$\hbar$ and $\overline{\varepsilon}$ of joint cumulants over new combinatorial objects we call
"ribbon paths". Our results reflect the fact that at fixed $\hbar>0$ the weight defining Fock space
is already a fractional Brownian motion of variance $\hbar$ and Hurst index $(-s) - \tfrac{1}{2}
\dim \mathbb{T} = + \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{2} = 0.$
