In recent years, non-Newtonian fluids have received much attention due to their numerous applications,
such as plastic manufacture and extrusion of polymer fluids. They are more complex than Newtonian
fluids because the relationship between shear stress and shear rate is nonlinear. One particular
subclass of non-Newtonian fluids is the generalized Oldroyd-B fluid, which is modelled using terms
involving multi-term time fractional diffusion and reaction. In this paper, we consider the application
of the finite difference method for this class of novel multi-term time fractional viscoelastic
non-Newtonian fluid models. An important contribution of the work is that the new model not only
has a multi-term time derivative, of which the fractional order indices range from 0 to 2, but also
possesses a special time fractional operator on the spatial derivative that is challenging to approximate.
There appears to be no literature reported on the numerical solution of this type of equation. We
derive two new different finite difference schemes to approximate the model. Then we establish
the stability and convergence analysis of these schemes based on the discrete $H^1$ norm and prove
that their accuracy is of $O(\tau+h^2)$ and $O(\tau^{\min\{3-\gamma_s,2-\alpha_q,2-\beta\}}+h^2)$,
respectively. Finally, we verify our methods using two numerical examples and apply the schemes
to simulate an unsteady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Couette flow of a generalized Oldroyd-B fluid
model. Our methods are effective and can be extended to solve other non-Newtonian fluid models such
as the generalized Maxwell fluid model, the generalized second grade fluid model and the generalized
Burgers fluid model.
