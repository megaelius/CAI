In a polycategory or multicategory, the existence of enough cells that satisfy certain divisibility
properties (representability) induces a coherent algebraic structure on the category of single-input,
single-output cells. This was used by Hermida to produce a new proof of strictification for monoidal
categories; working with the poly-bicategories of Cockett, Koslowski, and Seely, it could be extended
to strictification for bicategories. While the basic strategy seems generalisable, no full strictification
is possible for higher-dimensional categories, seemingly due to problems with cells that have
degenerate, strictly lower-dimensional boundaries. It was conjectured by C. Simpson that a semi-strictification
excluding weak units may be possible. In this article, we introduce a notion of regular poly-bicategory,
where 2-cells with degenerate boundaries are barred, and show that we can recover the coherent structure
of a bicategory through a different construction of weak units, inspired by the Saavedra units of
J. Kock. We prove that the existence of these weak units is equivalent to the existence of 1-cells
satisfying lower-dimensional divisibility properties, and study the relation between preservation
of units and preservation of divisible cells by a morphism. Then, we introduce merge-bicategories,
a variant of poly-bicategories which admits a natural monoidal closed structure, giving access
to higher morphisms. We derive equivalences between morphisms, transformations, and modifications
of representable merge-bicategories and the corresponding notions for bicategories. Finally,
we prove a semi-strictification theorem for representable merge-bicategories with a choice of
composites and units. This is meant as a first step towards a proof of C. Simpson's conjecture; we
sketch higher-dimensional analogues of most constructions involved.
