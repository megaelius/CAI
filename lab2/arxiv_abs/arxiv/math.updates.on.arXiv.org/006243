Extending the Wedderburn-Artin theory of (classically) semisimple associative rings to the realm
of topological rings with right linear topology, we show that the abelian category of left contramodules
over such a ring is split (equivalently, semisimple) if and only if the abelian category of discrete
right modules over the same ring is split (equivalently, semisimple). Our results in this direction
complement those of Iovanov-Mesyan-Reyes. An extension of the Bass theory of left perfect rings
to the topological realm is formulated as a list of conjecturally equivalent conditions, many equivalences
and implications between which we prove. In particular, all the conditions are equivalent for topological
rings with a countable base of neighborhoods of zero and for topologically right coherent topological
rings. Considering the rings of endomorphisms of modules as topological rings with the finite topology,
we establish a close connection between the concept of a topologically perfect topological ring
and the theory of modules with perfect decomposition. Our results also apply to endomorphism rings
and direct sum decompositions of objects in certain additive categories more general than the categories
of modules; we call them topologically agreeable categories. We show that any topologically agreeable
split abelian category is Grothendieck and semisimple. We also prove that a module $\Sigma$-coperfect
over its endomorphism ring has a perfect decomposition provided that either the endomorphism ring
is commutative or the module is countably generated, partially answering a question of Angeleri
Hugel and Saorin.
