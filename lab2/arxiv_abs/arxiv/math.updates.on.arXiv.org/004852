This paper studies convex stochastic dynamic team problems with finite and infinite time horizons
under decentralized information structures. First, we introduce two notions called exchangeable
teams and symmetric information structures. We show that in convex exchangeable team problems
an optimal policy exhibits a symmetry structure. We give a characterization for such symmetrically
optimal teams for a general class of convex dynamic team problems under mild conditional independence
conditions. In addition, through concentration of measure arguments, we establish the convergence
of optimal policies for teams with $N$ decision makers to the corresponding optimal policies for
symmetric mean-field teams with infinitely many decision makers. As a by-product, we present an
existence result for convex mean-field teams, where the main contribution of our paper is with respect
to the information structure in the system when compared with the related results in the literature
that have either assumed a classical information structure or a static information structure.
We also apply these results to the important special case of LQG team problems, where while for partially
nested LQG team problems with finite time horizons it is known that the optimal policies are linear,
for infinite horizon problems the linearity of optimal policies has not been established in full
generality. We also study, average cost finite and infinite horizon dynamic team problems with
a symmetric partially nested information structure and obtain globally optimal solutions where
we establish linearity of optimal policies. Moreover, we also study average cost infinite horizon
LQG dynamic teams under sparsity and delay constraints.
