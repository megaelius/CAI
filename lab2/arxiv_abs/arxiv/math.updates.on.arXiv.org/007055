Feedback controllers for port-Hamiltonian systems reveal an intrinsic inverse optimality property
since each passivating state feedback controller is optimal with respect to some specific performance
index. Due to the nonlinear port-Hamiltonian system structure, however, explicit (forward) methods
for optimal control of port-Hamiltonian systems require the generally intractable analytical
solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Adaptive dynamic programming methods provide
a means to circumvent this issue. However, the few existing approaches for port-Hamiltonian systems
hinge on very specific sub-classes of either performance indices or system dynamics or require
the intransparent guessing of stabilizing initial weights. In this paper, we contribute towards
closing this largely unexplored research area by proposing a time-continuous adaptive feedback
controller for the optimal control of general time-continuous input-state-output port-Hamiltonian
systems with respect to general Lagrangian performance indices. Its control law implements an
online learning procedure which uses the Hamiltonian of the system as an initial value function
candidate. The time-continuous learning of the value function is achieved by means of a certain
Lagrange multiplier that allows to evaluate the optimality of the current solution. In particular,
constructive conditions for stabilizing initial weights are stated and asymptotic stability
of the closed-loop equilibrium is proven. Our work is concluded by simulations for exemplary linear
and nonlinear optimization problems which demonstrate asymptotic convergence of the controllers
resulting from the proposed online adaptation procedure.
