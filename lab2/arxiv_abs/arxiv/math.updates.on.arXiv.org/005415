Normative expert systems have not become commonplace because they have been difficult to build
and use. Over the past decade, however, researchers have developed the influence diagram, a graphical
representation of a decision maker's beliefs, alternatives, and preferences that serves as the
knowledge base of a normative expert system. Most people who have seen the representation find it
intuitive and easy to use. Consequently, the influence diagram has overcome significantly the
barriers to constructing normative expert systems. Nevertheless, building influence diagrams
is not practical for extremely large and complex domains. In this book, I address the difficulties
associated with the construction of the probabilistic portion of an influence diagram, called
a knowledge map, belief network, or Bayesian network. I introduce two representations that facilitate
the generation of large knowledge maps. In particular, I introduce the similarity network, a tool
for building the network structure of a knowledge map, and the partition, a tool for assessing the
probabilities associated with a knowledge map. I then use these representations to build Pathfinder,
a large normative expert system for the diagnosis of lymph-node diseases (the domain contains over
60 diseases and over 100 disease findings). In an early version of the system, I encoded the knowledge
of the expert using an erroneous assumption that all disease findings were independent, given each
disease. When the expert and I attempted to build a more accurate knowledge map for the domain that
would capture the dependencies among the disease findings, we failed. Using a similarity network,
however, we built the knowledge-map structure for the entire domain in approximately 40 hours.
Furthermore, the partition representation reduced the number of probability assessments required
by the expert from 75,000 to 14,000.
