This paper studies closed 3-manifolds which are the attractors of a system of finitely many affine
contractions that tile $\mathbb{R}^3$. Such attractors are called self-affine tiles. Effective
characterization and recognition theorems for these 3-manifolds as well as theoretical generalizations
of these results to higher dimensions are established. The methods developed build a bridge linking
geometric topology with iterated function systems and their attractors. A method to model self-affine
tiles by simple iterative systems is developed in order to study their topology. The model is functorial
in the sense that there is an easily computable map that induces isomorphisms between the natural
subdivisions of the attractor of the model and the self-affine tile. It has many beneficial qualities
including ease of computation allowing one to determine topological properties of the attractor
of the model such as connectedness and whether it is a manifold. The induced map between the attractor
of the model and the self-affine tile is a quotient map and can be checked in certain cases to be monotone
or cell-like. Deep theorems from geometric topology are applied to characterize and develop algorithms
to recognize when a self-affine tile is a topological or generalized manifold in all dimensions.
These new tools are used to check that several self-affine tiles in the literature are 3-balls. An
example of a wild 3-dimensional self-affine tile is given whose boundary is a topological 2-sphere
but which is not itself a 3-ball. The paper describes how any 3-dimensional handlebody can be given
the structure of a self-affine 3-manifold. It is conjectured that every self-affine tile which
is a manifold is a handlebody.
