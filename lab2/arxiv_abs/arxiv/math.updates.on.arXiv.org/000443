This paper has two purposes: The first one is to introduce an extended setting to study Hecke pairs
$(G,H)$ which admit a regular representation on $L^2(H\backslash G)$. Many pairs of locally compact
groups which had been studied in noncommutative harmonic analysis, Lie theory and representation
theory are included in the theory of Hecke $C^\ast$-algebras. These Hecke pairs mainly consist
of locally compact groups and their compact subgroups, or cocompact subgroups, or open Hecke subgroups.
We clarify similarities, differences and relationships of our formulation with the discrete case.
In the discrete case, using the Schlichting completion, we show that the left regular representations
of associated Hecke algebras are bounded homomorphisms. Several criteria for relative unimodularity
of discrete Hecke pairs are also discussed. The second purpose of this paper is to study property
(RD) for Hecke pairs in our generalized setting. We discuss length functions on Hecke pairs and the
growth of Hecke pairs. We establish an equivalence between property (RD) of locally compact groups
and property (RD) of certain locally compact Hecke pairs. This allows us to transfer several important
results concerning property (RD) of locally compact groups into our setting, and consequently
identify many classes of examples of locally compact Hecke pairs with property (RD). As another
corollary, we show that a reduced discrete Hecke pair $(G,H)$ has (RD) if and only if its Schlichting
completion $\overline{G}$ has (RD). Then it follows that the relative unimodularity is a necessary
condition for a discrete Hecke pair to possess property (RD). Various aspects of discrete and locally
compact Hecke pairs are discussed by means of numerous examples.
