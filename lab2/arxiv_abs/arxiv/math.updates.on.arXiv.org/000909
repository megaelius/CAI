We study high order random walks in high dimensional expanders, namely, in complexes which are local
spectral expanders. Recent works have studied the spectrum of high order walks and deduced fast
mixing. However, the spectral gap of high order walks is inherently small, due to natural obstructions
(called coboundaries) that do \underline{not} happen for walks on expander graphs. In this work
we go beyond spectral gap, and relate the shrinkage of a $k$-cochain by the walk operator, to its structure.
We show a Decomposition Theorem: For every $k$-cochain $\phi$ defined on an $n$-dimensional complex,
that is a local spectral expander, there exists a a decomposition of $\phi$ into $i$-cochains $\phi_i$,
$1 \leq i \leq k$ such that $\Vert \phi \Vert^2 = \sum_{0 \leq i \leq k} \Vert \phi_i \Vert^2$ and such
that the more weight $\phi$ has on higher levels of the decomposition the better is its shrinkage
by the high order random walk operator. The following corollaries are implied by the Decomposition
Theorem: - We characterize mildly expanding $k$-cochains as those whose mass is concentrated on
the lower levels of the decomposition that we construct. - We get optimal mixing for high order random
walks on Ramanujan complexes. Previous results, could not be applied to the Ramanujan complexes
themselves, but only to some complexes that can be derived form them. Another result beyond spectral
gap that we achieve is analysing the shrinkage of binary cochains. Namely, we show that "locally
thin" binary cochains shrink dramatically by the high order random walk operator. A binary $k$-cochain
is "locally thin" if that the degree of the cochain in each $(k-1)$ simplex is small.
