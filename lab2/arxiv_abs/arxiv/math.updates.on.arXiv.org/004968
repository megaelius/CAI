The Byzantine distributed quickest change detection (BDQCD) is studied, where a fusion center
monitors the occurrence of an abrupt event through a bunch of distributed sensors that may be compromised.
We first consider the binary hypothesis case where there is only one post-change hypothesis and
prove a novel converse to the first-order asymptotic detection delay in the large mean time to a false
alarm regime. This converse is tight in that it coincides with the currently best achievability
shown by Fellouris et al.; hence, the optimal asymptotic performance of binary BDQCD is characterized.
An important implication of this result is that, even with compromised sensors, a 1-bit link between
each sensor and the fusion center suffices to achieve asymptotic optimality. To accommodate multiple
post-change hypotheses, we then formulate the multi-hypothesis BDQCD problem and again investigate
the optimal first-order performance under different bandwidth constraints. A converse is first
obtained by extending our converse from binary to multi-hypothesis BDQCD. Two families of stopping
rules, namely the simultaneous $d$-th alarm and the multi-shot $d$-th alarm, are then proposed.
Under sufficient link bandwidth, the simultaneous $d$-th alarm, with $d$ being set to the number
of honest sensors, can achieve the asymptotic performance that coincides with the derived converse
bound; hence, the asymptotically optimal performance of multi-hypothesis BDQCD is again characterized.
Moreover, although being shown to be asymptotically optimal only for some special cases, the multi-shot
$d$-th alarm is much more bandwidth-efficient and energy-efficient than the simultaneous $d$-th
alarm. Built upon the above success in characterizing the asymptotic optimality of the BDQCD, a
corresponding leader-follower Stackelberg game is formulated and its solution is found.
