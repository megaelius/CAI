A clutter is {\it clean} if it has no delta or the blocker of an extended odd hole minor. There are combinatorial
and geometric classes of clean clutters, namely ideal clutters, clutters without an intersecting
minor, and binary clutters. Tight connections between clean clutters and the first two classes
have recently been established. In this paper, we establish a deep connection between clean clutters
and binary clutters. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a clean clutter with covering number 2 where every element
is in a minimum cover. It was recently proved that $\mathcal{C}$ has a fractional packing of value
two. Collecting the supports of all such fractional packings, we obtain the {\it core} of $\mathcal{C}$.
We see that the core is a duplication of the cuboid of a set of 0-1 points, called the {\it setcore} of
$\mathcal{C}$. We see that the convex hull of the setcore is a full-dimensional polytope containing
the center of the hypercube in its interior. We define two parameters on $\mathcal{C}$, one is the
optimum of a combinatorial minimization problem called the {\it girth}, while the other is the optimum
of a geometric maximization problem called the {\it depth}. We prove a duality theorem between the
two parameters, exposing a fascinating interplay between the combinatorics and the geometry of
such clutters. Further stressing the interplay, we see that the convex hull of the setcore is a simplex
if and only if the setcore is the cocycle space of a projective geometry over GF(2). We see that if the
convex hull of the setcore is a simplex of dimension more than 3, then $\mathcal{C}$ has the Fano plane
as a minor. We also see an infinite class of ideal minimally non-packing clutters with covering number
two whose setcore corresponds to a simplex of dimension 3. Our results lend weight to two unpublished
conjectures of Seymour (1975) about dyadic fractional packings in ideal clutters.
