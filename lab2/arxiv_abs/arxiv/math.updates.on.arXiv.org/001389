The diffusion forecasting is a nonparametric approach that provably solves the Fokker-Planck
PDE corresponding to It\^o diffusion without knowing the underlying equation. The key idea of this
method is to approximate the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with a discrete representation
of the shift (Koopman) operator on a set of basis functions generated via the diffusion maps algorithm.
While the choice of these basis functions is provably optimal under appropriate conditions, computing
these basis functions is quite expensive since it requires the eigendecomposition of an $N\times
N$ diffusion matrix, where $N$ denotes the data size and could be very large. For large-scale forecasting
problems, only a few leading eigenvectors are computationally achievable. To overcome this computational
bottleneck, a new set of basis functions constructed by orthonormalizing selected columns of the
diffusion matrix and its leading eigenvectors is proposed. This computation can be carried out
efficiently via the unpivoted Householder QR factorization. The efficiency and effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm will be shown in both deterministically chaotic and stochastic dynamical
systems; in the former case, the superiority of the proposed basis functions over purely eigenvectors
is significant, while in the latter case forecasting accuracy is improved relative to using a purely
small number of eigenvectors. Supporting arguments will be provided on three- and six-dimensional
chaotic ODEs, a three-dimensional SDE that mimics turbulent systems, and also on the two spatial
modes associated with the boreal winter Madden-Julian Oscillation obtained from applying the
Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis on the measured Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR).
