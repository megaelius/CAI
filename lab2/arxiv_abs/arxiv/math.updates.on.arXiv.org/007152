Random binary search trees are obtained by recursively inserting the elements $\sigma(1),\sigma(2),\ldots,\sigma(n)$
of a uniformly random permutation $\sigma$ of $[n]=\{1,\dots,n\}$ into a binary search tree data
structure. Devroye (1986) proved that the height of such trees is asymptotically of order $c^*\log
n$, where $c^*=4.311\ldots$ is the unique solution of $c \log((2e)/c)=1$ with $c \geq 2$. In this
paper, we study the structure of binary search trees $T_{n,q}$ built from Mallows permutations.
A $\textrm{Mallows}(q)$ permutation is a random permutation of $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ whose probability
is proportional to $q^{\textrm{Inv}(\sigma)}$, where $\textrm{Inv}(\sigma) = \#\{i < j: \sigma(i)
> \sigma(j)\}$. This model generalizes random binary search trees, since $\textrm{Mallows}(q)$
permutations with $q=1$ are uniformly distributed. The laws of $T_{n,q}$ and $T_{n,q^{-1}}$ are
related by a simple symmetry (switching the roles of the left and right children), so it suffices
to restrict our attention to $q\leq1$. We show that, for $q\in[0,1]$, the height of $T_{n,q}$ is
asymptotically $(1+o(1))(c^* \log n + n(1-q))$ in probability. This yields three regimes of behaviour
for the height of $T_{n,q}$, depending on whether $n(1-q)/\log n$ tends to zero, tends to infinity,
or remains bounded away from zero and infinity. In particular, when $n(1-q)/\log n$ tends to zero,
the height of $T_{n,q}$ is asymptotically of order $c^*\log n$, like it is for random binary search
trees. Finally, when $n(1-q)/\log n$ tends to infinity, we prove stronger tail bounds and distributional
limit theorems for the height of $T_{n,q}$.
