In this work, we introduce two novel reformulations of a recent weakly hyperbolic model for two-phase
flow with surface tension. In the model, the tracking of phase boundaries is achieved by using a vector
interface field, rather than a scalar tracer, so that the surface-force stress tensor can be expressed
as an algebraic function of the state variables, without requiring the computation of gradients
of the tracer. An interesting and important feature of the model is that this interface field obeys
a curl involution constraint, that is, the vector field is required to be curl-free at all times.
The proposed modifications are intended to restore the strong hyperbolicity of the model, and are
closely related to divergence-preserving numerical approaches developed in the field of numerical
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The first strategy is based on the theory of Symmetric Hyperbolic
and Thermodynamically Compatible (SHTC) systems forwarded by Godunov in the 60s and 70s and yields
a modified system of governing equations which includes some symmetrisation terms, in analogy
to the approach adopted later by Powell et al for the ideal MHD equations. The second technique is
an extension of the hyperbolic Generalized Lagrangian Multiplier (GLM) divergence cleaning approach,
forwarded by Munz et al in applications to the Maxwell and MHD equations. We solve the resulting nonconservative
hyperbolic PDE systems with high order ADER Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods with a posteriori
Finite Volume subcell limiting and carry out a set of numerical tests concerning flows dominated
by surface tension as well as shock-driven flows. We also provide a new exact solution to the equations,
show convergence of the schemes for orders of accuracy up to ten in space and time, and investigate
the role of hyperbolicity and of curl constraints in the long-term stability of the computations.
