In this paper, we study the least-squares finite element methods (LSFEM) for the linear hyperbolic
transport equations. The linear transport equation naturally allows discontinuous solutions
and discontinuous inflow conditions, while the normal component of the flux across the mesh faces
needs to be continuous. Traditional LSFEMs using continuous finite element approximations will
introduce unnecessary extra error for discontinuous solutions and boundary conditions. In order
to separate the continuity requirements, a new flux variable is introduced. With this reformulation,
the continuities of the flux and the solution can be handled separately in natural $H(\mbox{div};\Omega)\times
L^2(\Omega)$ conforming finite element spaces. Several variants of the methods are developed
to handle the inflow boundary condition strongly or weakly. With the reformulation, the new LSFEMs
can handle discontinuous solutions and boundary conditions much better than the traditional LSFEMs
with continuous polynomial approximations. With least-squares functionals as a posteriori error
estimators, the adaptive methods can naturally identify error sources including singularity
and non-matching discontinuity. For discontinuity aligned mesh, no extra error is introduced.
If an $RT_0 \times P_0$ pair is used to approximate the flux and the solution, the new adaptive LSFEMs
can approximate discontinuous solutions with almost no overshooting even when the mesh is not aligned
with discontinuity. Existence and uniqueness of the solutions and a priori and a posteriori error
estimates are established for the proposed methods. Extensive numerical tests are performed to
show the effectiveness of the methods developed in the paper.
