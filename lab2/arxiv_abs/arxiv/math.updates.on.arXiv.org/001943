We introduce an abstract automaton model (DAMA) that captures the state transitions in athermal
discrete disordered systems that are induced by a varying external field. A broad class of models,
including the random-field Ising model (RFIM) as well as various charge-density-wave type depinning
models can be formulated as DAMAs. These systems exhibit return point memory (RPM), a tendency for
the system to return to the same microstate upon cycling the external field. It is known that the existence
of three conditions, (1) a partial order on a set of states; (2) a no-passing property; (3) an adiabatic
response to monotonous driving fields, implies RPM. When periodically driven, such systems settle
therefore into a cyclic response after a transient of at most one period. However conditions (1)
- (3) are only sufficient, they are not necessary. The DAMA description allow us to consider models
exhibiting the RPM property without necessarily having the no-passing property. We work out in
detail the structure of their associated state transition graphs. The RPM property constrains
the intra-loop structure of hysteresis loops, namely its hierarchical organization in sub loops.
We prove that the topology of this intra-loop structure has a natural representation in terms of
an ordered tree and that the corresponding state transition graph is planar. On the other hand, the
RPM property does not significantly restrict the inter-loop structure. A system exhibiting RPM
and subject to periodic forcing can thus undergo a large number of transient cycles before settling
into a periodic response. RPM alone, e.g. in the absence of no-passing, does not necessarily imply
a short transient response to cyclic forcing.
