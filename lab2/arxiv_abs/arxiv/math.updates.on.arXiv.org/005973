In this book we describe an approach through toric geometry to the following problem: "estimate
the number (counted with appropriate multiplicity) of isolated solutions of n polynomial equations
in n variables over an algebraically closed field k." The outcome of this approach is the number of
solutions for "generic" systems in terms of their "Newton polytopes," and an explicit characterization
of what makes a system "generic." The pioneering work in this field was done in the 1970s by Kushnirenko,
Bernstein and Khovanskii, who completely solved the problem of counting solutions of generic systems
on the "torus" (k\0)^n. In the context of our problem, however, the natural domain of solutions is
not the torus, but the affine space k^n. There were a number of works on extension of Bernstein's theorem
to the case of affine space, and recently it has been completely resolved, the final steps having
been carried out by the author. The aim of this book is to present these results in a coherent way. We
start from the beginning, namely Bernstein's beautiful theorem which expresses the number of solutions
of generic systems in terms of the mixed volume of their Newton polytopes. We give complete proofs,
over arbitrary algebraically closed fields, of Bernstein's theorem and its recent extension to
the affine space, and describe some open problems. We also apply the developed techniques to derive
and generalize Kushnirenko's results on Milnor numbers of hypersurface singularities which in
1970s served as a precursor to the development of toric geometry. Care was taken to make this book
as elementary as possible. In particular, we develop all the necessary algebraic geometry (modulo
some explicitly stated basic results).
