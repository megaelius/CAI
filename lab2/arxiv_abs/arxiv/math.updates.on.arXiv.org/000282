Motivated by a problem arising when analysing data from quarantine searches, we explore properties
of distributions of sums of independent means of independent lattice-valued random variables.
The aim is to determine the extent to which approximations to those sums require continuity corrections.
We show that, in cases where there are only two different means, the main effects of distribution
smoothness can be understood in terms of the ratio $\rho_{12}=(e_2n_1)/(e_1n_2)$, where $e_1$
and $e_2$ are the respective maximal lattice edge widths of the two populations, and $n_1$ and $n_2$
are the respective sample sizes used to compute the means. If $\rho_{12}$ converges to an irrational
number, or converges sufficiently slowly to a rational number; and in a number of other cases too,
for example those where $\rho_{12}$ does not converge; the effects of the discontinuity of lattice
distributions are of smaller order than the effects of skewness. However, in other instances, for
example where $\rho_{12}$ converges relatively quickly to a rational number, the effects of discontinuity
and skewness are of the same size. We also treat higher-order properties, arguing that cases where
$\rho_{12}$ converges to an algebraic irrational number can be less prone to suffer the effects
of discontinuity than cases where the limiting irrational is transcendental. These results are
extended to the case of three or more different means, and also to problems where distributions are
estimated using the bootstrap. The results have practical interpretation in terms of the accuracy
of inference for, among other quantities, the sum or difference of binomial proportions.
