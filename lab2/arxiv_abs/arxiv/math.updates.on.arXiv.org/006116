Applications in data science, shape analysis and object classification frequently require maps
between metric spaces which preserve geometry as faithfully as possible. In this paper, we combine
the Monge formulation of optimal transport with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance construction to
define a measure of the minimum amount of geometric distortion required to map one metric measure
space onto another. We show that the resulting quantity, called Gromov-Monge distance, defines
an extended quasi-metric on the space of isomorphism classes of metric measure spaces and that it
can be promoted to a true metric on certain subclasses of mm-spaces. We also give precise comparisons
between Gromov-Monge distance and several other metrics which have appeared previously, such
as the Gromov-Wasserstein metric and the continuous Procrustes metric of Lipman, Al-Aifari and
Daubechies. Finally, we derive polynomial-time computable lower bounds for Gromov-Monge distance.
These lower bounds are expressed in terms of distance distributions, which are classical invariants
of metric measure spaces summarizing the volume growth of metric balls. In the second half of the
paper, which may be of independent interest, we study the discriminative power of these lower bounds
for simple subclasses of metric measure spaces. We first consider the case of planar curves, where
we give a counterexample to the Curve Histogram Conjecture of Brinkman and Olver. Our results on
plane curves are then generalized to higher dimensional manifolds, where we prove some sphere characterization
theorems for the distance distribution invariant. Finally, we consider several inverse problems
on recovering a metric graph from a collection of localized versions of distance distributions.
Results are derived by establishing connections with concepts from the fields of computational
geometry and topological data analysis.
