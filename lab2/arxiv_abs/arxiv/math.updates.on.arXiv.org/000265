The trust-region problem, which minimizes a nonconvex quadratic function over a ball, is a key subproblem
in trust-region methods for solving nonlinear optimization problems. It enjoys many attractive
properties such as an exact semi-definite linear programming relaxation (SDP relaxation) and
strong duality. Unfortunately, such properties do not, in general, hold for an extended trust-region
problem having extra linear constraints. This paper shows that two useful and powerful features
of the classical trust-region problem continue to hold for an extended trust-region problem with
linear inequality constraints under a new dimension condition. First, we establish that the class
of extended trust-region problems has an exact SDP-relaxation, which holds without the Slater
constraint qualification. This is achieved by proving that a system of quadratic and affine functions
involved in the model satisfies a range-convexity whenever the dimension condition is fulfilled.
Second, we show that the dimension condition together with the Slater condition ensures that a set
of combined first and second-order Lagrange multiplier conditions is necessary and sufficient
for global optimality of the extended trust-region problem and consequently for strong duality.
Finally, we show that the dimension condition is easily satisfied for the extended trust-region
model that arises from the reformulation of a robust least squares problem (LSP) as well as a robust
second order cone programming model problem (SOCP) as an equivalent semi-definite linear programming
problem. This leads us to conclude that, under mild assumptions, solving a robust (LSP) or (SOCP)
under matrix-norm uncertainty or polyhedral uncertainty is equivalent to solving a SDP and so,
their solutions can be validated in polynomial time.
