The principal subject of this thesis is the gravitational two-body problem in the extreme-mass-ratio
regime---that is, where one mass is significantly smaller than the other---in the full context
of our contemporary theory of gravity, general relativity. We divide this work into two broad parts:
the first provides an overview of the theory of general relativity along with the basic mathematical
methods underlying it, focusing on its canonical formulation and perturbation techniques; the
second presents our novel work in these areas, focusing on the problems of entropy, motion and the
self-force in general relativity. We begin here with a study of entropy theorems in classical Hamiltonian
systems, and in particular, the issue of the second law of thermodynamics in classical mechanics
and general relativity. Then, we develop a general approach based on conservation laws for calculating
the correction to the motion of a sufficiently small object due to gravitational perturbations
in general relativity. When the perturbations are attributed to the small object itself, this effect
is known as the gravitational self-force. It is what drives the orbital evolution of extreme-mass-ratio
inspirals: compact binary systems where one mass is much smaller than---thus effectively orbiting
and eventually spiralling into---the other, expected to be among the main sources for the future
space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. Finally, we present some work on the numerical computation
of the scalar self-force using an approach called the Particle-without-Particle method, as well
as the generalization of this method to general partial differential equations and applications
to other areas of applied mathematics.
