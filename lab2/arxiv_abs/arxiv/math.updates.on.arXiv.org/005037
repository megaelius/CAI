We study the long-time behaviour of phenotype-structured models describing the evolutionary
dynamics of asexual species whose phenotypic fitness landscape is characterised by multiple peaks.
First we consider the case where phenotypic variations do not occur, and then we include the effect
of heritable phenotypic changes. In the former case the model is formulated in terms of an integrodifferential
equation for the phenotype distribution of the individuals of the species, whereas in the latter
case the evolution of the phenotype distribution is governed by a non-local parabolic equation
whereby a linear diffusion operator captures the presence of phenotypic variations. We prove that
the long-time limit of the solution to the integrodifferential equation is unique and given by a
measure consisting of a weighted sum of Dirac masses centred at the peaks of the phenotypic fitness
landscape. We also derive an explicit formula to compute the weights in front of the Dirac masses.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the long-time solution of the non-local parabolic equation exhibits
a qualitatively similar behaviour in the asymptotic regime where the diffusion coefficient modelling
the rate of phenotypic variations tends to zero. However, we show that the limit measure of the non-local
parabolic equation may consist of less Dirac masses, and we provide a sufficient criterion to identify
the positions of their centres. Finally, we provide a detailed characterisation of the speed of
convergence of the integral of the solution (i.e. the population size) to its long-time limit for
both models. Taken together, our results support a more in-depth theoretical understanding of
the conditions leading to the emergence of stable phenotypic polymorphism in asexual species.
