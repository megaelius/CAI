Wireless virtual reality (VR) imposes new visual and haptic requirements that are directly linked
to the quality-of-experience (QoE) of VR users. These QoE requirements can only be met by wireless
connectivity that offers high-rate and high-reliability low latency communications (HRLLC),
unlike the low rates usually considered in vanilla ultra-reliable low latency communication scenarios.
The high rates for VR over short distances can only be supported by an enormous bandwidth, which is
available in terahertz (THz) wireless networks. Guaranteeing HRLLC requires dealing with the
uncertainty that is specific to the THz channel. To explore the potential of THz for meeting HRLLC
requirements, a quantification of the risk for an unreliable VR performance is conducted through
a novel and rigorous characterization of the tail of the end-to-end (E2E) delay. Then, a thorough
analysis of the tail-value-at-risk (TVaR) is performed to concretely characterize the behavior
of extreme wireless events crucial to the real-time VR experience. System reliability for scenarios
with guaranteed line-of-sight (LoS) is then derived as a function of THz network parameters after
deriving a novel expression for the probability distribution function of the THz transmission
delay. Numerical results show that abundant bandwidth and low molecular absorption are necessary
to improve the reliability. However, their effect remains secondary compared to the availability
of LoS, which significantly affects the THz HRLLC performance. In particular, for scenarios with
guaranteed LoS, a reliability of 99.999% (with an E2E delay threshold of 20 ms) for a bandwidth of
15 GHz can be achieved by the THz network, compared to a reliability of 96% for twice the bandwidth,
when blockages are considered.
