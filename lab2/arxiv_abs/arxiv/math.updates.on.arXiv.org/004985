We describe a framework for bounding extreme values of quantities on global attractors of differential
dynamical systems. A global attractor is the minimal set that attracts all bounded sets; it contains
all forward-time limit points. Our approach uses (generalized) Lyapunov functions to find attracting
sets, which must contain the global attractor, and the choice of Lyapunov function is optimized
based on the quantity whose extreme value one aims to bound. We also present a non-global framework
for bounding extrema over the minimal set that is attracting in a specified region of state space.
If the dynamics are governed by ordinary differential equations, and the equations and quantities
of interest are polynomial, then our methods can be implemented computationally using polynomial
optimization. In particular, we enforce nonnegativity of certain polynomial expressions by requiring
them to be representable as sums of squares, leading to a convex optimization problem that can be
recast as a semidefinite program and solved computationally. This computer assistance lets one
construct complicated polynomial Lyapunov functions. Computations are illustrated using three
examples. The first is the chaotic Lorenz system, where we bound extreme values of various monomials
of the coordinates over the global attractor. In the second example we bound extreme values in a nine-mode
truncation of fluid dynamics which displays long-lived chaotic transients. The third example
has two locally stable limit cycles, each with its own basin of attraction. We apply our non-global
framework to construct bounds for one basin that do not apply to the other. For each example we compute
Lyapunov functions of polynomial degrees up to at least eight. In cases where we can judge the sharpness
of our bounds, they are sharp to at least three digits when the polynomial degree is at least four or
six.
