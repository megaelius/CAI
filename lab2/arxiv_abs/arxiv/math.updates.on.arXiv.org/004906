This paper presents a physics-informed machine learning (ML) framework to construct reduced-order
models (ROMs) for reactive-transport quantities of interest (QoIs) based on high-fidelity numerical
simulations. QoIs include species decay, product yield, and degree of mixing. The ROMs for QoIs
are applied to quantify and understand how the chemical species evolve over time. First, high-resolution
datasets for constructing ROMs are generated by solving anisotropic reaction-diffusion equations
using a non-negative finite element formulation for different input parameters. Non-negative
finite element formulation ensures that the species concentration is non-negative (which is needed
for computing QoIs) on coarse computational grids even under high anisotropy. The reactive-mixing
model input parameters are a time-scale associated with flipping of velocity, a spatial-scale
controlling small/large vortex structures of velocity, a perturbation parameter of the vortex-based
velocity, anisotropic dispersion strength/contrast, and molecular diffusion. Second, random
forests, F-test, and mutual information criterion are used to evaluate the importance of model
inputs/features with respect to QoIs. Third, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector
Regression (SVR) are used to construct ROMs based on the model inputs. Then, SVR-ROMs are used to
predict scaling of QoIs. Qualitatively, SVR-ROMs are able to describe the trends observed in the
scaling law associated with QoIs. Fourth, the scaling law's exponent dependence on model inputs/features
are evaluated using $k$-means clustering. Finally, in terms of the computational cost, the proposed
SVM-ROMs and SVR-ROMs are $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ times faster than running a high-fidelity numerical
simulation for evaluating QoIs.
