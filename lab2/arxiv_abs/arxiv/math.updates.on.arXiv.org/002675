The aim of this expository article is to present recent developments in the centuries old discussion
on the interrelations between continuous and differentiable real valued functions of one real
variable. The truly new results include, among others, the $D^n$-$C^n$ interpolation theorem:
{\em For every $n$-times differentiable $f\colon\R\to\R$ and perfect $P\subset \R$ there is a
$C^n$ function $g\colon\R\to\R$ such that $f\restriction P$ and $g\restriction P$ agree on an
uncountable set} and an example of a differentiable function $F\colon\R\to\R$ (which can be nowhere
monotone) and of compact perfect $\mathfrak{X}\subset\R$ such that $F'(x)=0$ for all $x\in \mathfrak{X}$
while $F[\mathfrak{X}]=\mathfrak{X}$; thus, the map $\mathfrak{f}=F\restriction\mathfrak{X}$
is shrinking at every point while, paradoxically, not globally. We also present a new short and elementary
construction of {\em everywhere differentiable nowhere monotone $h\colon \R\to\R$}\/ and the
proofs (not involving Lebesgue measure/integration theory) of the theorems of Jarn\'\i k and of
Laczkovich. The main part of this exposition, concerning continuity and first order differentiation,
is presented in an narrative that answers two classical questions: \textit{To what extend a continuous
function must be differentiable?} and \textit{How strong is the assumption of differentiability
of a continuous function?} In addition, we overview the results concerning higher order differentiation.
This includes the Whitney extension theorem and the higher order interpolation theorems related
to Ulam-Zahorski problem. Finally, we discuss the results concerning smooth functions that are
independent of the standard axioms ZFC of set theory. We close with a list of currently open problems
related to this subject.
