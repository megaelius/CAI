This paper investigates the performance of cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA)
in a cellular downlink system. The system model consists of a base station (BS) serving multiple
users, where users with good channel quality can assist the transmissions between the BS and users
with poor channel quality through either half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD) device-to-device
(D2D) communications. We formulate and solve a novel optimization problem that jointly determines
the optimal D2D user pairing and the optimal power control scheme, where the objective is maximizing
the achievable sum rate of the whole system while guaranteeing a certain quality of service (QoS)
for all users. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is generally
NPhard. To overcome this issue, we reconstruct the original problem into a bi-level optimization
problem that can be decomposed into two sub-problems to be solved independently. The outer problem
is a linear assignment problem which can be efficiently handled by the well-known Hungarian method.
The inner problem is still a non-convex optimization problem for which finding the optimal solution
is challenging. However, we derive the optimal power control policies for both the HD and the FD schemes
in closedform expressions, which makes the computational complexity of the inner problems polynomial
for every possible pairing configurations. These findings solve ultimately the original MILNP
in a timely manner that makes it suitable for real-time and low latency applications. Our simulation
results show that the proposed framework outperforms a variety of proposed schemes in the literature
and that it can obtain the optimal pairing and power control policies for a network with 100 users
in a negligible computational time.
