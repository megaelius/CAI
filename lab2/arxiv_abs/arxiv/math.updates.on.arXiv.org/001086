Delay-coordinate mapping is an effective and widely used technique for reconstructing and analyzing
the dynamics of a nonlinear system based on time-series outputs. The efficacy of delay-coordinate
mapping has long been supported by Takens' embedding theorem, which guarantees that delay-coordinate
maps use the time-series output to provide a reconstruction of the hidden state space that is a one-to-one
embedding of the system's attractor. While this topological guarantee ensures that distinct points
in the reconstruction correspond to distinct points in the original state space, it does not characterize
the quality of this embedding or illuminate how the specific parameters affect the reconstruction.
In this paper, we extend Takens' result by establishing conditions under which delay-coordinate
mapping is guaranteed to provide a stable embedding of a system's attractor. Beyond only preserving
the attractor topology, a stable embedding preserves the attractor geometry by ensuring that distances
between points in the state space are approximately preserved. In particular, we find that delay-coordinate
mapping stably embeds an attractor of a dynamical system if the stable rank of the system is large
enough to be proportional to the dimension of the attractor. The stable rank reflects the relation
between the sampling interval and the number of delays in delay-coordinate mapping. Our theoretical
findings give guidance to choosing system parameters, echoing the trade-off between irrelevancy
and redundancy that has been heuristically investigated in the literature. Our initial result
is stated for attractors that are smooth submanifolds of Euclidean space, with extensions provided
for the case of strange attractors.
