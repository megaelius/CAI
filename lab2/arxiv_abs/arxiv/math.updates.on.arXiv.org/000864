We further develop a recently introduced variational principle of stationary action for problems
in nonconservative classical mechanics and extend it to classical field theories. The variational
calculus used is consistent with an initial value formulation of physical problems and allows for
time-irreversible processes, such as dissipation, to be included at the level of the action. In
this formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a nonconservative action
$\mathcal{S}$, which is a functional of a doubled set of degrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative
Lagrangian contains a potential $K$ which generates nonconservative forces and interactions.
Such a nonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open system interacting
with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out or coarse-graining a subset of variables
in closed systems. We generalize Noether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and
no longer conserved when $K$ is non-vanishing. Consequently, the nonconservative aspects of a
physical system are derived solely from $K$. We show how to use the formalism with examples of nonconservative
actions for discrete systems including forced damped harmonic oscillators, radiation reaction
on an accelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative classical
field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible thermodynamic processes to be
included in an unconstrained variational principle. We present the nonconservative action for
a Navier-Stokes fluid including the effects of viscous dissipation and heat diffusion, as well
as an action that generates the Maxwell model for viscoelastic materials, which can be easily generalized
to more realistic rheological models. We show that the nonconservative action can be derived as
the classical limit of a more complete quantum theory.
