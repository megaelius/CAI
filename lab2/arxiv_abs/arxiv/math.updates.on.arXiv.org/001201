In this paper, a joint relay selection and power allocation (JRP) scheme is proposed to enhance the
physical layer security of a cooperative network, where a multiple antennas source communicates
with a single-antenna destination in presence of untrusted relays and passive eavesdroppers (Eves).
The objective is to protect the data confidentially while concurrently relying on the untrusted
relays as potential Eves to improve both the security and reliability of the network. To realize
this objective, we consider cooperative jamming performed by the destination while JRP scheme
is implemented. With the aim of maximizing the instantaneous secrecy rate, we derive a new closed-form
solution for the optimal power allocation and propose a simple relay selection criterion under
two scenarios of non-colluding Eves (NCE) and colluding Eves (CE). For the proposed scheme, a new
closed-form expression is derived for the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the secrecy outage probability
as security metrics, and a new closed-form expression is presented for the average symbol error
rate (SER) as a reliability measure over Rayleigh fading channels. We further explicitly characterize
the high signal-to-noise ratio slope and power offset of the ESR to highlight the impacts of system
parameters on the ESR. In addition, we examine the diversity order of the proposed scheme to reveal
the achievable secrecy performance advantage. Finally, the secrecy and reliability diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff of the optimized network are provided. Numerical results highlight that the ESR performance
of the proposed JRP scheme for NCE and CE cases is increased with respect to the number of untrustworthy
relays.
