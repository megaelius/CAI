Colored triangulations offer a generalization of combinatorial maps to higher dimensions. Just
like maps are gluings of polygons, colored triangulations are built as gluings of special, higher-dimensional
building blocks, such as octahedra, which we call colored building blocks and known in the dual as
bubbles. A colored building block is determined by its boundary triangulation, which in the case
of polygons is simply characterized by its length. In three dimensions, colored building blocks
are labeled by some 2D triangulations and those homeomorphic to the 3-ball are labeled by the subset
of planar ones. Similarly to Euler's formula in 2D which provides an upper bound to the number of vertices
at fixed number of polygons with given lengths, we look in three dimensions for an upper bound on the
number of edges at fixed number of given colored building blocks. In this article we solve this problem
when all colored building blocks, except possibly one, are homeomorphic to the 3-ball. To do this,
we find a characterization of the way a colored building block homeomorphic to the ball has to be glued
to other blocks of arbitrary topology in a colored triangulation which maximizes the number of edges.
This local characterization can be extended to the whole triangulation as long as there is at most
one colored building block which is not a 3-ball. The triangulations obtained this way are in bijection
with trees. The number of edges is given as an independent sum over the building blocks of such a triangulation.
In the case of all colored building blocks being homeomorphic to the 3-ball, we show that these triangulations
are homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Those results were only known for the octahedron and for melonic
building blocks before. This article is self-contained and can be used as an introduction to colored
triangulations and their bubbles from a purely combinatorial point of view.
