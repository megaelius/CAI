This paper meticulously revisit and study the flux geometry of any compact connected oriented manifold
$(M; W)$. We generalize several well-known factorization results, exhibit some orbital conditions
under which flux geometry can be studied, give a proof of the discreteness of the flux group for volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms, and show that the kernel of the flux for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms is
$C^1$closed inside the group of all volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity
map: This recovers several well-known results from symplectic geometry. The fix-points theory
does not resist to the above machinery: We prove a general contractibility result with respect to
the orbits of the fix-points for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map
via vanishing-flux paths, generalize and solve the Arnold conjecture using the Thurston fragmentation
property. In the sequel, we use fix-points to: Characterize the flux geometry of certain $C^0$limits
of sequences of vanishing-flux paths and volumepreserving diffeomorphisms. Beside this, a $C^0$criterion
for the existence of at least one fix-point is given, and a weak version of the generalized $C^0$flux
conjecture is solved. Finally, we construct a pseudo right-invariant metric on the group of all
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map, prove several comparison results
suitable to the study of the Hofer-like geometry of the group $Ham(N; w)$, of all Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms
of a closed symplectic manifold $(N; w)$, derive the equivalence between the Hofer and the Hofer-like
metrics on $Ham(N; w)$, and exhibit a computational proof of the non-degeneracy of the Hofer-like
energies: Here, an outcome is that the Calabi group controls the Hofer-like geometry of the group
$Ham(N; w)$ of any non-simply connected closed symplectic manifold $(N; w)$.
