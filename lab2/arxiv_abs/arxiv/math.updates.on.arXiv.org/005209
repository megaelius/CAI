We prove that the M\"obius group $G(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ having
dimension $n\ge 3$, acts isometrically on the multipliers algebra $\mathcal{M}(H^{1,2}_e(\mathbb{R}^n))$
of the extended Sobolev space $H^{1,2}_e(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Then we prove that the Dirichlet integral
$(\mathcal{D},H^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n))$ is a closable quadratic form on the space $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n,\Gamma[a])$
associated to the energy measure $\Gamma[a]=|\nabla a|^2\, dx$ of any multiplier $a\in \mathcal{M}(H^{1,2}_e(\mathbb{R}^n))$.
Moreover, it is shown that its quadratic form closure $(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{F}^a)$ is a Dirichlet
form on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n,\Gamma[a])$ which is naturally unitarely equivalent to the one $(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{F}^{a\circ\gamma})$
on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n,\Gamma[a\circ\gamma])$ for any M\"obius transformation $\gamma\in G(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
In a converse direction and for dimenasions $n\ge 2$, we prove that an homeomorphism $\gamma:U\to\gamma(U)$
which gives rise to an algebraic isomorphism $a\mapsto a\circ\gamma$ between the algebras of finite
energy multipliers $\mathcal{F}\mathcal{M}(H^{1,2}(\gamma(A)))$ and $\mathcal{F}\mathcal{M}(H^{1,2}(A))$
of any relatively compact domain $A\subseteq U$ and leaves invariant the corresponding fundamental
tones \[ \mu_1(\gamma(A),a)=\mu_1(A,a\circ\gamma)\, , \] necessarily is the restriction to
$U$ of a M\"obius transformation. Companion results are proved for quasi-conformal and bounded
distortion maps. These results are preceded by the study of the connections between fundamental
tones and ergodic properties of multipliers. In particular, it is shown that the non vanishing of
the fundamental tone of any multiplier follows from the existence of the spectral gap of the Dirichlet
integral.
