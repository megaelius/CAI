We provide a pair of dual results, each stating the coincidence of highness properties from computability
theory. We provide an analogous pair of dual results on the coincidence of cardinal characteristics
within ZFC. A mass problem is a set of functions on $\omega$. For mass problems $\mathcal C, \mathcal
D$, one says that $\mathcal C$ is Muchnik reducible to $\mathcal D$ if each function in $\mathcal
D$ computes a function in $\mathcal C$. In this paper we view highness properties as mass problems,
and compare them with respect to Muchnik reducibility and its uniform strengthening, Medvedev
reducibility. Let $\mathcal D(p)$ be the mass problem of infinite bit sequences $y$ (i.e., 0,1 valued
functions) such that for each computable bit sequence $x$, the asymptotic lower density $\underline
\rho$ of the agreement bit sequence $x \leftrightarrow y$ is at most $p$ (this sequence takes the
value 1 at a bit position iff $x$ and $y$ agree). We show that all members of this family of mass problems
parameterized by a real $p$ with $0 < p<1/2 $ have the same complexity in the sense of Muchnik reducibility.
This also yields a new version of Monin's affirmative answer to the "Gamma question", whether $\Gamma(A)<
1/2$ implies $\Gamma(A)=0$ for each Turing oracle $A$. We also show, together with Joseph Miller,
that for any order function~$g$ there exists a faster growing order function $h $ such that $\mathrm{IOE}(g)
$ is strictly Muchnik below $\mathrm{IOE}(h)$. We study cardinal characteristics analogous to
the highness properties above. For instance, $\mathfrak d (p)$ is the least size of a set $G$ of bit
sequences so that for each bit sequence $x$ there is a bit sequence $y$ in $G$ so that $\underline \rho
(x \leftrightarrow y) >p$. We prove within ZFC all the coincidences of cardinal characteristics
that are the analogs of the results above.
