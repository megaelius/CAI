The global boundedness and the hair trigger effect of solutions for the nonlinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion
equation \begin{align*} \pd ut=\Delta u+\mu u^\alpha(1-\kappa J*u^\beta),\quad\hbox{in}
\;\mathbb R^N\times(0,\infty),\; N\geq 1 \end{align*} with $\alpha,\beta\geq1$, $\mu,\kappa>0$
and $u(x,0)=u_0(x)$ are investigated. Under appropriate assumptions on $J$, it is proved that
for any nonnegative and bounded initial condition, if $\alpha\in[1,\alpha^*)\cup[1,\frac{1+\beta}{2}]$
with $\alpha^*=1+\beta$ for $N=1$ and $\alpha^*=1+\frac{2\beta}{N}$ for $N\geq 2$, then the
problem has a global bounded classical solution. Under further assumptions on the initial datum,
the solutions satisfying $0\leq u(x,t)\leq\kappa^{-\frac1\beta}$ for any $(x,t)\in\mathbb
R^N\times[0,+\infty)$ are shown to converge to $\kappa^{-\frac1\beta}$ uniformly on any compact
subset of $\mathbb R^N$, which is known as the hair trigger effect. 1D numerical simulations of the
above nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation are performed and the effect of several combinations
of parameters and convolution kernels on the solution behavior is investigated. Namely, for the
supercritical case, the unboundedness of the solution is numerically tested. For the subcritical
case, i.e. the case for which the boundedness of solutions has been proved, the hair trigger effect
is revealed for small $\kappa$ values. For relatively large $\kappa$, take $\kappa=1$ for example,
the hair trigger effect is numerically confirmed for small $\mu$'s, while for relatively large
$\mu$ values, different patterns appear with different choices of convolution kernels. These
motivate a discussion about some conjectures arising from this model and further issues to be studied
in this context. A formal deduction of the model from a mesoscopic formulation is provided as well.
