We already know a great deal about dynamical systems with uniqueness in forward time. Indeed, flows,
semiflows, and maps (both invertible and not) have been studied at length. A view that has proven
particularly fruitful is topological: consider invariant sets (attractors, repellers, periodic
orbits, etc.) as topological objects, and the connecting sets between them form gradient like flows.
In the case of systems with uniqueness in forward time, an attractor in one system is related to nearby
attractors in a family of other, "close enough" systems. One way of seeing that connection is through
the Conley decomposition (and the Conley index) [2], [13]. This approach requires focusing on isolated
invariant sets - that is, invariant sets with isolating neighborhoods. If there is an invariant
set $I$, which has an isolating neighborhood $N$ $\ldots$. This approach was expanded to discrete
time systems which lack uniqueness in forward time, using relations, in [7] and [11]. Relations
do not rely on uniqueness in forward time, but the graph of any map is a relation; thus they serve to
generalize maps. Some of this is reviewed in the next few sections. In addition, I expanded on work
done in [7] to show that in compact metric spaces, attractors for closed relations continue (see
Section 6). On the continuous time side, more work needs to be done. This paper is a step toward a more
systematic approach for continuous time systems which lack uniqueness in forward time. This work
applies to Filippov systems [4] and in control theory [12]. In the following pages, we establish
a tool (multiflows) for discussing the continuous time case and develop a framework for understanding
attractors (and therefore stability) in these systems. A crucial part of this work was establishing
attractor / attracting neighborhood pairs, which happens in Section 5.5.
