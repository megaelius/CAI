In this paper, we present some new results on non-Riemannian geometry, more specifically, asymmetric
connections and Weyl's geometry. For asymmetric connections, we show that a projective change
in the symmetric part generates a vector field that its not arbitrary, as usually presented, but
rather, the gradient of a non-arbitrary scalar function. We use normal coordinates for the symmetric
part of asymmetric connections as well as for the Weyl's geometry. This has a direct impact on asymmetric
conections, although normal frames are usual in antisymmetic connections, unlike normal coordinates.
In this symmetric part of asymmetric connections, the vector fields obeys a well-known partial
differential equantion, whereas in Weyl's geometry, gauge vector fields obey an equation that
we believe is presented for the first time in this paper. We deduce the exact solution of each of these
vector fields as the gradient of a scalar function. For both asymmetric and Weyl's symmetric connections,
the respective scalar functions obey respective scalar partial differential equations. As a consequence,
Weyl's geometry is a conformal differential geometry and is associated with asymmetric geometry
by a projective change. We also show that a metric tensor naturally appears in asymmetric geometry
and is not introduced via a postulate, as is usually done. In Weyl's geometry, the eletromagnetic
gauge is the gradient of a non-arbitrary scalar function and eletromagnetic fields are null. Despide
the origin in Weyl's differential geometry, the use of the eletromagnetic gauge is correct in Lagrangean
and Hamiltonian formulations of field theories.
