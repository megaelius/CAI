This work is concerned with the mathematical analysis of random suspensions of rigid particles
settling under gravity in viscous fluids. Each particle generates a fluid flow that in turn acts
on other particles and hinders their settling. In an equilibrium perspective, for a given ensemble
of particle positions, we analyze both the associated mean settling speed and the velocity fluctuations
of individual particles. In the 1970s, Batchelor gave a proper definition of the mean settling speed
based on the appropriate renormalization of long-range particle contributions. In the 1980s,
a celebrated formal calculation by Caflisch and Luke suggested that velocity fluctuations in dimension
$d=3$ should diverge with the size of the sedimentation tank, contradicting both intuition and
experimental observations. The role of long-range self-organization of suspended particles
in form of hyperuniformity was put forward later on to explain additional screening of this divergence
in steady-state observations. The main difficulty to make these predictions rigorous is to account
for the nonlinear multibody hydrodynamic interactions in a context when stochastic cancellations
are crucial, and to show how the improvement provided by hyperuniformity on the linearized problem
is not destroyed by the nonlinearity (as it would be in stochastic homogenization of linear elliptic
equations, for instance). To this end, we introduce a suitable functional-analytic version of
hyperuniformity, which is of independent interest, and we appel to a new annealed regularity theory
for the steady Stokes equation describing the viscous fluid in presence of a random suspension.
As a corollary, we establish a homogenization result for a steady Stokes fluid in a finite tank with
a dense suspension of small sedimenting particles, and we define the associated effective viscosity.
