We introduce a suitable notion of quantum coherent state to describe the electrostatic field of
a static classical charge distribution, thereby underpinning the author's 1998 formulae for the
inner product of a pair of such states. (We also correct an incorrect factor of $4\pi$.) Contrary
to what one might expect, this is non-zero whenever the two total charges are equal, even if the charge
distributions themselves are different. We then address the problem of furnishing QED with a "product
structure", i.e. a formulation in which there is a total Hamiltonian, arising as a sum of a free electromagnetic
Hamiltonian, a free charged-matter Hamiltonian and an interaction term, acting on a total Hilbert
space which is the tensor product of an electromagnetic Hilbert space and a charged-matter Hilbert
space. (The traditional Coulomb-gauge formulation of QED doesn't have a product structure in this
sense because, in it, the longitudinal part of the electric field is a function of the charged matter
operators.) Motivated by all this, and both for a charged Dirac field and for a system of non-relativistic
charged balls, we transform Coulomb-gauge QED into an equivalent formulation which we call the
"product picture". This involves a full Hilbert space which is the tensor product of a Hilbert space
of transverse and longitudinal photons with a Hilbert space for charged matter and in this sits a
physical subspace (in all states of which the charged matter is entangled with longitudinal photons)
on which Gauss's law holds strongly, together with a total Hamiltonian which has a product structure,
albeit the electric field operator while self-adjoint on the physical subspace, isn't self-adjoint
on the full Hilbert space. The product-picture Hamiltonian resembles the temporal gauge Hamiltonian,
but the product picture is free from the difficulties in pre-existing temporal-gauge quantizations.
