Attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus by introducing strict quarantine measures apparently
have different effect in different countries: while the number of new cases has reportedly decreased
in China and South Korea, it still exhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across
Europe. In this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means
of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we introduce a new model of infection
progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation
period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is determined
by the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during
the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\mathcal{R}_0
>1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if $\mathcal{R}_0
<1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities),
then the number of infected decays exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease
development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics,
growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). Analysis of the data in China
and Korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after
the restricting measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the total
number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate remains exponential in Italy.
Arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are
needed.
