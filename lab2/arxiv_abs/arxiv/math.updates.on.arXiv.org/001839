We study relatively free associative algebras $F_r^{\left(n\right)}$ of ranks $r=2,3$ with the
identity $\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]=0$ of Lie nilpotency of step $n\ge3$ over a field $K$ of
characteristic $\ne2,3$. First we prove the Theorem about the inclusion $T^{\left(m\right)}\left(A\right)\cdot
T^{\left(n\right)}\left(A\right)\subseteq T^{\left(m+n-1\right)}\left(A\right)$ for
associative algebra $A$ of rank $3$, where $T^{\left(n\right)}$ is a T-ideal generated by the commutator
$\left[x_1,\dots,x_n\right]$; the restriction on rank is essential. Further, we describe 3-variable
identities of the algebra $F^{\left(n\right)}$. In particular, the obtained description implies
that $Z\left(F_r^{\left(n\right)}\right)= \left(T^{\left(n-1\right)}+Z_q\right) \left(F_r^{\left(n\right)}\right)$,
where $p=\mathrm{char}\left(K\right)\ge 5$ and $q$ is a least power of $p$ such that $q\ge n-1$
and $Z_q$ is a T-space generated by $x^q$. We also prove the equality $Z\left(F_2^{\left(n\right)}\right)=F_2^{\left(n\right)}\cap
Z\left( F^{\left(n\right)}\right)$. In addition, we obtain certain generalizations and refinements
of some results by A.V. Grishin and V.V. Schigolev, respectively. For example, we prove that a unital
algebra $\widehat{F_2^{\left(n\right)}}$ $\left(n\ge 4\right)$ over a field $K$ of characteristic
$p>2\left(n-1\right)$ possesses a finite descending "compositional" chain of T-ideals $T^{\left(3\right)}=T_1\supset
T_2\supset \dots T_k\supset T_{k+1}=0$ such that all quotients $T_i / T_{i+1}$ do not contain any
proper T-spaces. Key words: Lie nilpotency identity, center, kernel, proper polynomial, 2-variable
identity, T-space.
