Ordinarily, quiver varieties are constructed as moduli spaces of quiver representations in the
category of vector spaces. It is also natural to consider quiver representations in a richer category,
namely that of vector bundles on some complex variety equipped with a fixed sheaf that twists the
morphisms. Representations of A-type quivers in this twisted category --- known in the literature
as "holomorphic chains" --- have practical use in questions concerning the topology of the moduli
space of Higgs bundles. In that problem, the variety is a Riemann surface of genus at least 2, and the
twist is its canonical line bundle. We extend the treatment of twisted A-type quiver representations
to any genus using the Hitchin stability condition induced by Higgs bundles and computing their
deformation theory. We then focus in particular on so-called "argyle quivers", where the rank labelling
alternates between 1 and integers $r_i\geq1$. We give explicit geometric identifications of moduli
spaces of twisted representations of argyle quivers on $\mathbb{P}^1$ using invariant theory
for a non-reductive action via Euclidean reduction on polynomials. This leads to a stratification
of the moduli space by change of bundle type, which we identify with "collision manifolds" of invariant
zeroes of polynomials. We also relate the present work to Bradlow-Daskalopoulos stability and
Thaddeus' pullback maps to stable tuples. We apply our results to computing $\mathbb{Q}$-Betti
numbers of low-rank twisted Higgs bundle moduli spaces on $\mathbb{P}^1$, where the Higgs fields
take values in an arbitrary ample line bundle. Our results agree with conjectural Poincar\'e series
arising from the ADHM recursion formula.
