The dual use of radio signals for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)
has recently drawn significant attention. To meet the practical requirement that energy receivers
(ERs) operate with significantly higher received power as compared to information receivers (IRs),
ERs need to be deployed in more proximity to the transmitter than IRs. However, due to the broadcast
nature of wireless channels, one critical issue arises that the messages sent to IRs can be eavesdropped
by ERs, which possess better channels from the transmitter. In this paper, we address this new secrecy
communication problem in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where
one multi-antenna transmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to an IR and multiple
ERs, each with one single antenna. To optimally design transmit beamforming vectors and their power
allocation, two problems are investigated with different aims: the first problem maximizes the
secrecy rate for IR subject to individual harvested energy constraints of ERs, while the second
problem maximizes the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs subject to a secrecy rate constraint
for IR. We solve these two non-convex problems optimally by reformulating each of them into a two-stage
problem. First, by fixing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) target for ERs
(for the first problem) or IR (for the second problem), we obtain the optimal beamforming and power
allocation solution by applying the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, the original
problems are solved by a one-dimension search over the optimal SINR target for ERs or IR. Furthermore,
for each of the two studied problems, suboptimal solutions of lower complexity are also proposed
in which the information and energy beamforming vectors are separately designed with their power
allocation.
