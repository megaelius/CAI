Objective: The subtraction approach is known for being a theoretically-rigorous and accurate
technique for solving the forward problem in electroencephalography by means of the finite element
method. One key aspect of this approach consists of computing integrals of singular kernels over
the discretised domain, usually referred to as potential integrals. Several techniques have been
proposed for dealing with such integrals, all of them approximating the results at the expense of
reducing the accuracy of the solution. In this paper, we derive analytic formulas for the potential
integrals, reducing approximation errors to a minimum. Approach: Based on volume coordinates
and Gauss theorems, we obtained parametric expressions for all the element matrices needed in the
formulation assuming first order basis functions defined on a tetrahedral mesh. This included
solving potential integrals over triangles and tetrahedra, for which we found compact and efficient
formulas. Main results: Comparison with numerical quadrature schemes allowed to test the advantages
of the methodology proposed, which were found of great relevance for highly-eccentric sources,
as those found in the somatosensory and visual cortices. Moreover, the availability of compact
formulas allowed an efficient implementation of the technique, which resulted in similar computational
cost than the simplest numerical scheme. Significance: The analytical subtraction approach is
the optimal subtraction-based methodology with regard to accuracy. The computational cost is
similar to that obtained with the lowest order numerical integration scheme, making it a competitive
option in the field. The technique is highly relevant for improving electromagnetic source imaging
results utilising individualised head models and anisotropic electric conductivity fields without
imposing impractical mesh requirements.
