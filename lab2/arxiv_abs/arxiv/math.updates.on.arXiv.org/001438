This paper concerns a Fokker-Planck equation on the positive real line modeling nucleation and
growth of clusters. The main feature of the equation is the dependence of the driving vector field
and boundary condition on a non-local order parameter related to the excess mass of the system. The
first main result concerns the well-posedness and regularity of the Cauchy problem. The well-posedness
is based on a fixed point argument, and the regularity on Schauder estimates. The first a priori estimates
yield H\"older regularity of the non-local order parameter, which is improved by an iteration argument.
The asymptotic behavior of solutions depends on the initial density $\rho_0$. For some $\rho_s>0$
and $0\leq \rho_0 \leq \rho_s$, there exists an equilibrium solution $c^\text{eq}_{(\rho_0)}$.
If $\rho_0\le\rho_s$ the solution converges strongly to $c^\text{eq}_{(\rho_0)}$, while if
$\rho_0 > \rho_s$ the solution converges weakly to $c^\text{eq}_{(\rho_s)}$. The excess density
$\rho_0 - \rho_s$ gets lost due to the formation of larger and larger clusters. In this regard, the
model behaves similarly to the classical Becker-D\"oring equation. The system possesses a free
energy, strictly decreasing along the evolution, which establishes the long time behavior. In
the subcritical case $\rho_0<\rho_s$ the entropy method, based on suitable weighted logarithmic
Sobolev inequalities and interpolation estimates, is used to obtain explicit convergence rates
to the equilibrium solution. The close connection of the present and the Becker-D\"oring model
is outlined by a family of discrete Fokker-Planck type equations interpolating between both of
them. This family of models possesses a gradient flow structure emphasizing the common structure.
