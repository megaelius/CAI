We provide a new definition of a local walk dimension $\beta$ that depends only on the metric and not
on the existence of a particular regular Dirichlet form or heat kernel asymptotics. Moreover, we
study the local Hausdorff dimension $\alpha$ and prove that any variable Ahlfors regular measure
of variable dimension $Q$ is strongly equivalent to the local Haudorff measure with $Q=\alpha,$
generalizing the constant dimensional case. Additionally, we provide constructions of several
variable dimensional spaces, including a new example of a variable dimensional Sierpinski carpet.
We show also that there exist natural examples where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ both vary continuously.
We prove $\beta\geq 2$ provided the space is doubling. We use the local exponent $\beta$ in time-scale
renormalization of discrete time random walks, that are approximate at a given scale in the sense
that the expected jump size is the order of the space scale. In analogy with the variable Ahlfors regularity
space scaling condition involving $\alpha$, we consider the condition that the expected time to
leave a ball scales like the radius of the ball to the power $\beta$ of the center. Under this local
time scaling condition along with the local space scaling condition of Ahlfors regularity, we then
study the $\Gamma$ and Mosco convergence of the resulting continuous time approximate walks as
the space scale goes to zero. We prove that a non-trivial Dirichlet form with Dirichlet boundary
conditions on a ball exists as a Mosco limit of approximate forms. One of the novel ideas in this construction
is the use of exit time functions, analogous to the torsion functions of Riemannian geometry, as
test functions to ensure the resulting domain contains enough functions. We also prove tightness
of the associated continuous time processes.
