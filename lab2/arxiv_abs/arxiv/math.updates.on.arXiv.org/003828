The large-scale structure of the universe is comprised of virialized blob-like clusters, linear
filaments, sheet-like walls and huge near empty three-dimensional voids. Characterizing the
large scale universe is essential to our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies.
The density range of clusters, walls and voids are relatively well separated, when compared to filaments,
which span a relatively larger range. The large scale filamentary network thus forms an intricate
part of the cosmic web. In this paper, we describe Felix, a topology based framework for visual exploration
of filaments in the cosmic web. The filamentary structure is represented by the ascending manifold
geometry of the 2-saddles in the Morse-Smale complex of the density field. We generate a hierarchy
of Morse-Smale complexes and query for filaments based on the density ranges at the end points of
the filaments. The query is processed efficiently over the entire hierarchical Morse-Smale complex,
allowing for interactive visualization. We apply Felix to computer simulations based on the heuristic
Voronoi kinematic model and the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and demonstrate its usefulness
through two case studies. First, we extract cosmic filaments within and across cluster like regions
in Voronoi kinematic simulation datasets. We demonstrate that we produce similar results to existing
structure finders. Filaments that form the spine of the cosmic web, which exist in high density regions
in the current epoch, are isolated using Felix. Also, filaments present in void-like regions are
isolated and visualized. These filamentary structures are often over shadowed by higher density
range filaments and are not easily characterizable and extractable using other filament extraction
methodologies.
