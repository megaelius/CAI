It is a standard criterium in statistics to define an optimal estimator the one with the minimum variance.
Thus, the optimality is proved with inequality among variances of competing estimators. The inequalities,
demonstrated here, disfavor the standard least squares estimators. Inequalities among estimators
are connected to names of Cramer, Rao and Frechet. The standard demonstrations of these inequalities
require very special analytical properties of the probability functions, globally indicated
as regular models. These limiting conditions are too restrictive to handle realistic problems
in track fitting. A previous extension to heteroscedastic models of the Cramer-Rao-Frechet inequalities
was performed with Gaussian distributions. These demonstrations proved beyond any possible doubts
the superiority of the heteroscedastic models compared to the standard least squares method. However,
the Gaussian distributions are typical members of the required regular models. Instead, the realistic
probability distributions, encountered in tracker detectors, are very different from Gaussian
distributions. Therefore, to have well grounded set of inequalities, the limitations to regular
models must be overtaken. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the inequalities for least squares
estimators for irregular models of probabilities, explicitly excluded by the Cramer-Rao-Frechet
demonstrations. Estimators for straight and parabolic tracks will be considered. The final part
deals with the form of the distributions of simplified heteroscedastic track models reconstructed
with optimal estimators and the standard (non-optimal) estimators. A comparison among the distributions
of these different estimators shows the large loss in resolution of the standard least-squares
estimators.
