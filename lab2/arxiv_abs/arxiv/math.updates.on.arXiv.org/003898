This paper is the first of a series in which we develop exact and approximate algorithms for mappings
of systems of differential equations. Here we introduce the MapDE algorithm and its implementation
in Maple, for mappings relating differential equations. We consider the problem of how to algorithmically
characterize, and then to compute mappings of less tractable (Source) systems R to more tractable
(Target) systems ^R by exploiting the Lie algebra of vector fields leaving R invariant. For systems
of exact differential polynomials R, ^R our algorithm MapDE can decide, under certain assumptions,
if there exists a local invertible mapping Psi(x; u) = (^x; ^u) that maps the Source system R to the
Target ^R. We use a result of Bluman and Kumei who have shown that the mapping satisfies infinitesimal
(linearized) mapping equations that map the infinitesimals of the Lie invariance algebra for R
to those for ^R. MapDE involves applying the differential-elimination algorithm to the defining
systems for infinitesimal symmetries of R, ^R, and also to the nonlinear mapping equations (including
the Bluman-Kumei mapping subsystem); returning them in a form which includes its integrability
conditions and for which an existence-uniqueness theorem is available. Once existence is established,
a second stage can determine features of the map, and some times by integration, explicit forms of
the mapping. Examples are given to illustrate the algorithm. Algorithm MapDE also allows users
to enter broad target classes instead of a specific system ^R. For example, we give an algorithmic
approach that avoids the integrations of the Bluman-Kumei approach where MapDE can determine if
a linear differential equation R can be mapped to a linear constant coefficient differential equation.
