This paper presents an efficient parallel direct algorithm with near-optimal complexity for the
compact fourth and sixth-order approximation of the three-dimensional Helmholtz equations [1]
with the problem coefficient depending on only one of the coordinate directions. The developed
method is based on a combination of the separation of variables technique and a Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) type method. Similar direct solvers for the lower-order approximations of the two and three-dimensional
Helmholtz equation were considered in several previous publications by the authors and other researchers
(see e.g. [2,3,4,5]). The authors also consider a generalization of the presented algorithm to
the solution of a wide class of linear systems obtained from approximation on the compact 27-point
three-dimensional stencils on the rectangular grids with similar requirements on the stencil
coefficients. The general restrictions on the coefficients in the considered class of compact
schemes are developed and presented. This class includes the second, fourth and sixth-order compact
approximation schemes for the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation considered in this paper
and our previous publications [2,3,6]. As an example of the diversity of applications of the developed
general method, the direct parallel implementation of a compact fourth-order approximation scheme
for a convection-diffusion equation is considered. The results of the implementation of this method
in OpenMP, MPI and hybrid programming environments on the multicore computers and multiple node
clusters are presented and discussed. The results demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed
direct solvers for many important applications on the structured grid with the corresponding 27-diagonal
matrices.
