Using a lattice model of polymers in a tube, we define one way to characterise different configurations
of a given knot as either "local" or "non-local" and, for several ring polymer models, we provide
both theoretical and numerical evidence that, at equilibrium, the non-local configurations are
more likely than the local ones. These characterisations are based on a standard approach for measuring
the "size" of a knot within a knotted polymer chain. The method involves associating knot-types
to subarcs of the chain, and then identifying a knotted subarc with minimal arclength; this arclength
is then the knot-size. If the resulting knot-size is small relative to the whole length of the chain,
then the knot is considered to be localised or "local". If on the other hand the knot-size is comparable
to the length of the chain, then the knot is considered to be "non-local". Using this definition,
we establish that all but exponentially few sufficiently long self-avoiding polygons (closed
chains) in a tubular sublattice of the simple cubic lattice are "non-locally" knotted. This is shown
to also hold for the case when the same polygons are subject to an external tensile force, as well as
in the extreme case when they are as compact as possible (no empty lattice sites). We also provide
numerical evidence for small tube sizes that at equilibrium non-local knotting is more likely than
local knotting, regardless of the strength of the stretching or compressing force. We note however
that because of the tube confinement, the occurrence of non-local knotting in walks (open chains)
is significantly different than for polygons. The relevance of these results to recent experiments
involving DNA knots in solid-state nanopores is also discussed.
