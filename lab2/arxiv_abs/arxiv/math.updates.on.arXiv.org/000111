The authors of \cite{BKR} studied the derived functor $DRep_n(A)$ of the classical representation
scheme $\Rep_n(A)$. They constructed canonical trace maps ${Tr}_n(A)_{\bullet}\,:\,HC_{\bullet}(A)
\rar \H_{\bullet}[DRep_n(A)]^{GL_n}$. These maps yield a homomorphism $Sym{Tr}_n(A)_{\bullet}\,:\,
Sym_k[HC_{\bullet}(A)] \rightarrow H_{\bullet}[DRep_n(A)]^{GL_n}$ of graded commutative
algebras. Given a classical result of Procesi \cite{P}, it is natural to ask whether $Sym{Tr}_n(A)_{\bullet}$
is surjective. For an augmented algebra $A$, we construct a canonical dense DG subalgebra $\DRep_{\infty}(A)^{{Tr}}$
of the commutative DG algebra $\DRep_{\infty}(A)^{\GL_{\infty}}$. It turns out that $\DRep_{\infty}(A)^{{Tr}}$
is a commutative cocommutative DG Hopf algebra. Our main result shows that on passing to the inverse
limit (as $n \rightarrow \infty$), the family of maps $Sym{Tr}_n(A)_{\bullet}$ `converges' to
an isomorphism $Sym_k(\bar{HC}_{\bullet}(A)) \,\cong\, H_{\bullet}[DRep_{\infty}(A)^{{Tr}}]$
of graded Hopf algebras. A derived version of Procesi's result is therefore, true in the limit. However,
for fixed (finite) $n$, we obtain homological obstructions to the surjectivity of $Sym{Tr}_n(A)_{\bullet}$
that do not vanish in general. As a consequence of our main result and the well known Loday-Quillen-Tsygan
theorem, we show that the Chevalley-Eilenberg coalgebra $\mathcal{C}_\bullet(\mathfrak{gl}_\infty(A),
\mathfrak{gl}_\infty(k); k)$ is Koszul dual to $DRep_{\infty}(A)^{{Tr}}$. Our main result also
extends to the {\it bigraded} setting, where $DRep_{\infty}(A)^{{Tr}}$ coincides with $DRep_{\infty}(A)^{GL_{\infty}}$.
Computing the (graded) Euler characteristics of $\DRep_{\infty}(A)^{GL_{\infty}}$ and $\bar{HC}_{\bullet}(A)$
independently, one deduces interesting combinatorial identities from our main result.
