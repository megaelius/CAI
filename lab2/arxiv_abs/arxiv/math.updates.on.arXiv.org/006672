In the present paper, we study the combined incompressible and fast rotation limits for the full
Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with Coriolis, centrifugal and gravitational forces, in the regime
of small Mach, Froude and Rossby numbers and for general ill-prepared initial data. We consider
both the isotropic scaling (where all the numbers have the same order of magnitude) and the multi-scale
case (where some effect is predominant with respect to the others). In the case when the Mach number
is of higher order than the Rossby number, we prove that the limit dynamics is described by an incompressible
Oberbeck-Boussinesq system, where the velocity field is horizontal (according to the Taylor-Proudman
theorem), but vertical effects on the temperature equation are not negligible. Instead, when the
Mach and Rossby numbers have the same order of magnitude, and in absence of the centrifugal force,
we show convergence to a quasi-geostrophic equation for a stream function of the limit velocity
field, coupled with a transport-diffusion equation for a new unknown, which links the target density
and temperature profiles. The proof of the convergence is based on a compensated compactness argument.
The key point is to identify some compactness properties hidden in the system of acoustic-Poincar\'e
waves. Compared to previous results, our method enables first of all to treat the whole range of parameters
in the multi-scale problem, and also to consider a low Froude number regime with the somehow critical
choice $Fr=\sqrt{Ma}$, where $Ma$ is the Mach number. This allows us to capture some (low) stratification
effects in the limit.
