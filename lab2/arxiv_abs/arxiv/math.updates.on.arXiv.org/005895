An efficient and accurate finite-element algorithm is described for the numerical solution of
the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations. The new algorithm that solves the INS equations
in a velocity-pressure reformulation is based on a split-step scheme in conjunction with the standard
finite-element method. The split-step scheme employed for the temporal discretization of our
algorithm completely separates the pressure updates from the solution of velocity variables.
When the pressure equation is formed explicitly, the algorithm avoids solving a saddle-point problem;
therefore, our algorithm has more flexibility in choosing finite-element spaces. For efficiency
and robustness, Lagrange finite elements of equal order for both velocity and pressure are used.
Motivated by a post-processing technique that calculates derivatives of a finite element solution
with super-convergent error estimates, an alternative numerical boundary condition is proposed
for the pressure equation at the discrete level. The new numerical pressure boundary condition
that can be regarded as a better implementation of the compatibility boundary condition improves
the boundary-layer errors of the pressure solution. Normal-mode analysis is performed using a
simplified model problem on a uniform mesh to demonstrate the numerical properties of our methods.
Convergence study using $\mathbb{P}_1$ elements confirms the analytical results and demonstrates
that our algorithm with the new numerical boundary condition achieves the optimal second-order
accuracy for both velocity and pressure up-to the boundary. Benchmark problems are also computed
and carefully compared with existing studies. Finally, as an example to illustrate that our approach
can be easily adapted for higher-order finite elements, we solve the classical flow-past-a-cylinder
problem using $\mathbb{P}_n$ finite elements with $n\geq 1$.
