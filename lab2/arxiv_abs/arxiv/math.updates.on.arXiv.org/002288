We study path-connectedness and homotopy groups of sets of tensors defined by tensor rank, border
rank, multilinear rank, as well as their symmetric counterparts for symmetric tensors. We show
that over $\mathbb{C}$, the set of rank-$r$ tensors and the set of symmetric rank-$r$ symmetric
tensors are both path-connected if $r$ is not more than the complex generic rank; these results also
extend to border rank and symmetric border rank over $\mathbb{C}$. Over $\mathbb{R}$, the set of
rank-$r$ tensors is path-connected if it has the expected dimension but the corresponding result
for symmetric rank-$r$ symmetric $d$-tensors depends on the order $d$: connected when $d$ is odd
but not when $d$ is even. Border rank and symmetric border rank over $\mathbb{R}$ have essentially
the same path-connectedness properties as rank and symmetric rank over $\mathbb{R}$. When $r$
is greater than the complex generic rank, we are unable to discern any general pattern: For example,
we show that border-rank-three tensors in $\mathbb{R}^2 \otimes \mathbb{R}^2 \otimes \mathbb{R}^2$
fall into four connected components. For multilinear rank, the manifold of $d$-tensors of multilinear
rank $(r_1,\dots,r_d)$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbb{C}^{n_d}$ is always
path-connected, and the same is true in $\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbb{R}^{n_d}$
unless $n_i = r_i = \prod_{j \ne i} r_j$ for some $i\in\{1, \dots, d\}$. Beyond path-connectedness,
we determine, over both $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$, the fundamental and higher homotopy groups
of the set of tensors of a fixed small rank, and, taking advantage of Bott periodicity, those of the
manifold of tensors of a fixed multilinear rank. We also obtain analogues of these results for symmetric
tensors of a fixed symmetric rank or a fixed symmetric multilinear rank.
