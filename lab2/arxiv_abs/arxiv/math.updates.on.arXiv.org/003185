We investigate critical points and minimizers of the Yang-Mills functional YM on quantum Heisenberg
manifolds $D^c_{\mu\nu}$, where the Yang-Mills functional is defined on the set of all compatible
linear connections on finitely generated projective modules over the QHMs. A compatible linear
connection which is both a critical point and minimizer of YM is called a Yang-Mills connection.
In this paper, we investigate Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature. We are interested
in Yang-Mills connections on the following classes of modules over the QHMs: (i) Abadie's module
$\Xi$ of trace $2\mu$ and its submodules; (ii) modules $\Xi^\prime$ of trace $2\nu$; (iii) tensor
product modules of the form $P E^c_{\mu\nu}\otimes \Xi$, where $E^c_{\mu\nu}$ is Morita equivalent
to $D^c_{\mu\nu}$ and $P$ is a projection in $E^c_{\mu\nu}$. We present a characterization of critical
points and minimizers of YM, and provide a class of new Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature
via concrete examples. Also we show that these Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature
do not provide global minima but only local minima. We do this by constructing a set of compatible
connections that are not critical points but their values are smaller than those of Yang-Mills connections
with constant curvature. We also give two other examples which show that the critical points and
minimizers of YM depend crucially on the geometry of the QHMs and of the projective modules over them.
Furthermore, we construct the Grassmannian connection on the projective modules $\Xi^\prime$
with trace $2\nu$ over the QHMs and compute its corresponding curvature. Finally, we construct
a tensor product connections on $P E^c_{\mu\nu}\otimes \Xi$ whose coupling constant is $2\nu$
and characterize the critical points of YM for this projective module.
