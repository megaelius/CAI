This thesis concerns the relationship between bounded and controlled topology and how these can
be used to recognise which homotopy equivalences of reasonable topological spaces are homotopic
to homeomorphisms. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a simplicial map of finite-dimensional locally finite simplicial
complexes. We prove that $f$ has contractible point inverses if and only if it is an $\epsilon$-controlled
homotopy equivalences for all $\epsilon>0$, if and only if $f\times\mathrm{id}:X\times\mathbb{R}
\to Y\times\mathbb{R}$ is a homotopy equivalence bounded over the open cone $O(Y^+)$ of Pedersen
and Weibel. This approach can be generalised to algebra using geometric categories: the $X$-controlled
categories $\mathbb{A}^*(X)$, $\mathbb{A}_*(X)$ of Ranicki and Weiss together with the bounded
categories $\mathcal{C}_M(\mathbb{A})$ of Pedersen and Weibel. Analogous to the barycentric
subdivision of a simplicial complex, we define the algebraic subdivision of a chain complex over
that simplicial complex. The main theorem of the thesis is that a chain complex $C$ is chain contractible
in $\mathbb{A}(X)$ if and only if $\textit{"}C\otimes\mathbb{Z}\textit{"}\in\mathbb{A}(X\times\mathbb{R})$
is boundedly chain contractible when measured in $O(X^+)$ for a functor $\textit{"}-\otimes\mathbb{Z}\textit{"}$
defined appropriately using algebraic subdivision and for $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{A}^*$ or $\mathbb{A}_*$.
We prove a squeezing result: a chain complex with a small enough chain contraction has arbitrarily
small chain contractions. We conclude with consequences for Poincar\'e Duality spaces. Squeezing
tells us that a $PL$ Poincar\'e duality space with small enough Poincar\'e duality is a homology
manifold and the main theorem tells us that a $PL$ Poincar\'e duality space $X$ is a homology manifold
if and only if $X\times\mathbb{R}$ has bounded Poincar\'e duality when measured in the open cone
$O(X^+)$.
