Inspired by recent work of Bridgeland, from the category C^b(E) of bounded complexes over an exact
category E satisfying certain finiteness conditions, we construct an associative unital "semi-derived
Hall algebra" SDH(E). This algebra is an object sitting, in some sense, between the usual Hall algebra
H(C^b(E)) and the Hall algebra of the bounded derived category D^b(E), introduced by Toen and further
generalized by Xiao and Xu. It has the structure of a free module over a suitably defined quantum torus
of acyclic complexes, with a basis given by the isomorphism classes of objects in the bounded derived
category D^b(E). We prove the invariance of SDH(E) under derived equivalences induced by exact
functors between exact categories. For E having enough projectives and such that each object has
a finite projective resolution, we describe a similar construction for the category of Z/2-graded
complexes, with similar properties of associativity, freeness over the quantum torus and derived
invariance. In particular, this Z/2-graded semi-derived Hall algebra is isomorphic to the Hall
algebra of the category of Z/2-graded complexes with projective components (localized at the classes
of contractibles) considered by Bridgeland, who related it to the corresponding quantum group
when E is the category of representations of a quiver. If E is hereditary and has enough projectives,
we show that the multiplication in SDH(E) is given by the same formula as the Ringel-Hall multiplication,
and SDH(E) is isomorphic to a certain quotient of the classical Hall algebra H(C^b(E)) localized
at the classes of acyclic complexes. We also prove the same result in the Z/2-graded case.
