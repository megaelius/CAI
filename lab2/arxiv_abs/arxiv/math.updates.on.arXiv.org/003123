We propose the following definition of topological quantum phases valid for mixed states: two states
are in the same phase if there exists a time independent, fast and local Lindbladian evolution driving
one state into the other. The underlying idea, motivated by Koenig and Pastawski in 2013, is that
it takes time to create new topological correlations, even with the use of dissipation. We show that
it is a good definition in the following sense: (1) It divides the set of states into equivalent classes
and it establishes a partial order between those according to their level of "topological complexity".
(2) It provides a path between any two states belonging to the same phase where observables behave
smoothly. We then focus on pure states to relate the new definition in this particular case with the
usual definition for quantum phases of closed systems in terms of the existence of a gapped path of
Hamiltonians connecting both states in the corresponding ground state path. We show first that
if two pure states are in the same phase in the Hamiltonian sense, they are also in the same phase in
the Lindbladian sense considered here. We then turn to analyse the reverse implication, where we
point out a very different behaviour in the case of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases
in 1D. Whereas at the Hamiltonian level, phases are known to be classified with the second cohomology
group of the symmetry group, we show that symmetry cannot give any protection in 1D in the Lindbladian
sense: there is only one SPT phase in 1D independently of the symmetry group. We finish analysing
the case of 2D topological quantum systems. There we expect that different topological phases in
the Hamiltonian sense remain different in the Lindbladian sense. We show this formally only for
the $\mathbb{Z}_n$ quantum double models.
