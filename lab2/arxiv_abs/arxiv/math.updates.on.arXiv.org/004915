Let $\mathcal K$ be a field of formal Laurent series with coefficients in a finite field of characteristic
$p$, $\mathcal G_{<p}$ --- the maximal quotient of $\operatorname{Gal} (\mathcal K_{sep}/\mathcal
K)$ of period $p$ and nilpotent class $<p$ and $\{\mathcal G_{<p}^{(v)}\}_{v\geqslant 0}$ ---
its filtration by ramification subgroups in the upper numbering. Let $\mathcal G_{<p}=G(\mathcal
L)$ be the identification of nilpotent Artin-Schreier theory: here $G(\mathcal L)$ is the group
obtained from a suitable profinite Lie $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra $\mathcal L$ via the Campbell-Hausdorff
composition law. We develop a new technique to describe the ideals $\mathcal L^{(v)}$ such that
$G(\mathcal L^{(v)})=\mathcal G_{<p}^{(v)}$ and to find their generators. Given $v_0\geqslant
1$ we construct epimorphism of Lie algebras $\bar\eta ^{\dag }:\mathcal L\longrightarrow \bar{\mathcal
L}^{\dag }$ and an action $\Omega_U$ of the formal group of order $p$, $\alpha =_p=\operatorname{Spec}\,\mathbb{F}_p[U]$,
$U^p=0$, on $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$. Suppose $d\Omega_U=B^{\dag }U$, where $B^{\dag }\in\operatorname{Diff}\bar{\mathcal
L}^{\dag }$, and $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }[v_0]$ is the ideal of $\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }$ generated
by the elements of $B^{\dag }(\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag })$. The main result of the paper states that
$\mathcal L^{(v_0)}=(\bar\eta ^{\dag })^{-1}\bar{\mathcal L}^{\dag }[v_0]$. In the last sections
we relate this result to the explicit construction of generators of $\mathcal L^{(v_0)}$ obtained
earlier by the author, develop its more efficient version and apply it to the recovering of the whole
ramification filtration of $\mathcal G_{<p}$ from the set of its jumps.
