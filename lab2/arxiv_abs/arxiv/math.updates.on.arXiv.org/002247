Let $\ell, n$ be positive integers such that $\ell\geq n$. Let $\mathbb{G}_{n,\ell-n}$ be the Grassmannian
manifold which consists of the set of $n$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^{\ell}$. There
is an $\mathbb{Z}$-graded algebra isomorphism between the cohomology $\rm{H}*(\mathbb{G}_{n,\ell-n},\mathbb{Z})$
of $\mathbb{G}_{n,\ell-n}$ and a natural $\mathbb{Z}$-form $B$ of the $\mathbb{Z}$-graded basic
algebra of the type $A$ cyclotomic nilHecke algebra $\mathscr{H}_{\ell,n}^{(0)}=< \psi_1,\cdots,\psi_{n-1},y_1,\cdots,y_n>$.
In this paper, we show that the isomorphism can be chosen such that the image of each (geometrically
defined) Schubert class $(a_1,\cdots,a_{n})$ coincides with the basis element $b_{\mathbf{\lambda}}$
constructed in an earlier paper by the second author and Xinfeng Liang using purely algebraic method,
where $0\leq a_1\leq a_2\leq\cdots\leq a_{n}\leq \ell-n$ with $a_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ for each $i$,
$\mathbb{\lambda}$ is the $\ell$-multipartition of $n$ associated to $\(\ell+1-(a_{n}+n),
\ell+1-(a_{n-1}+n-1),\cdots,\ell+1-(a_1+1))$. A similar isomorphism between the cohomology
$\rm{H}^*(\mathbb{G}_{\ell-n,n},\mathbb{Z})$ of the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}_{\ell-n,n}$
and the natural $\mathbb{Z}$-form $B$ of the $\mathbb{Z}$-graded basic algebra of $\mathscr{H}_{\ell,n}^{(0)}$
is also obtained. As applications, we obtain a second version of Giambelli formula for Schubert
classes and show that each basis element $z_{\mathbf{\lambda}}$ (constructed in the earlier paper
mentioned above) of the center $Z$ of $\mathscr{H}_{\ell,n}^{(0)}$ is equal to the evaluation
of a Schur (symmetric) polynomial at $y_1,\cdots,y_n$.
