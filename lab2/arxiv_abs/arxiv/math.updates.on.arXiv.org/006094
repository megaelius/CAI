Sparse superposition codes (SPARCs) are a class of codes for efficient communication over the AWGN
channel at rates approaching the channel capacity. In a SPARC, codewords are sparse linear combinations
of columns of an i.i.d. Gaussian design matrix. In a spatially coupled SPARC, the design matrix has
a block-wise structure where the variance of the Gaussian entries can be varied across blocks. A
well-designed spatial coupling structure can enhance theerror performance of iterative decoding
algorithms such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP). In this paper, we obtain a non-asymptotic
bound on the probability of error of spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding. Applying this bound
to a simple band-diagonal design matrix, we prove that spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding
achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel. The bound also highlights how the decay of error probability
depends on each design parameter of the spatially coupled SPARC. The asymptotic mean squared error
(MSE) of the AMP decoder can be predicted via a deterministic recursion called state evolution.
Our result provides the first proof that the MSE concentrates on the state evolution prediction
for spatially coupled SPARCs. Combined with the state evolution prediction, this result implies
that spatially coupled SPARCs are capacity-achieving. The proof technique used to establish the
main result is also used to obtain a concentration inequality for the MSE of AMP applied to compressed
sensing with spatially coupled design matrices. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results
that demonstrate the finite length error performance of spatially coupled SPARCs. The performance
is compared with coded modulation schemes that use LDPC codes from the DVB-S2 standard.
