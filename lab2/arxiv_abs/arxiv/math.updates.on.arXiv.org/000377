Consider the reaction-diffusion PDE $u_t=\Delta u + f(x,u)$ with $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and general
inhomogeneous ignition reaction $f\ge 0$ vanishing at $u=0,1$. Typical solutions $0\le u\le 1$
transition from $0$ to $1$ as time progresses, and their (nested) super-level sets $\Omega_{u,a}(t)=\{x\,|\,u(t,x)\ge
a\}$ ($a\in(0,1)$) may in general have a complicated geometry. Under fairly general qualitative
hypotheses on $f$, in dimensions $d\le 3$, we prove that $\Omega_{u,a}(t)$ is contained in the $\ell_a$-neighborhood
of $\Omega_{u,1-a}(t)$ for each $a>0$, with $\ell_a$ depending on $a$ and some bounds on $f$,
but not on $f,u,$ or $t$. We also show that on each time interval longer than some constant independent
of $f,u,t$, the set $\Omega_{u,a}(t)$ grows at any point of its boundary with average speed in the
interval given by the spreading speeds corresponding to any $x$-independent lower and upper bounds
on $f$. That is, the transition from any small $a>0$ to $1-a$ occurs within uniformly bounded
distances in both space and time, so $u(t,\cdot)$ is in a sense uniformly close to the characteristic
function of some set $\Omega_u(t)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ that grows with a uniformly controlled
(below and above) speed. On the other hand, for $d\ge 2$, transition from $1-a$ to $a$ need not occur
on uniformly bounded spatial distances in general. Moreover, the same is true even for the transition
from $a$ to $1-a$ when $d\ge 4$, so the above claims turn out to be false in dimensions $d\ge 4$ (at least
without further quantitative hypotheses on $f$). Our results are new for periodic and some even
for homogeneous reactions in dimensions $d\ge 2$. They also extend to other types of reactions --
monostable, bistable, and mixed -- as well as to transitions between general equilibria $u^-<u^+$
of the PDE, and to solutions not necessarily satisfying $u^-\le u\le u^+$.
