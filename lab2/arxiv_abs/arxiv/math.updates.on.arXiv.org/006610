In quantum many-body systems with local interactions, quantum information and entanglement cannot
spread outside of a linear light cone, which expands at an emergent velocity analogous to the speed
of light. Local operations at sufficiently separated spacetime points approximately commute
-given a many-body state, $\mathcal{O}_x(t) \mathcal{O}_y |\psi\rangle \approx \mathcal{O}_y\mathcal{O}_x(t)
|\psi\rangle$ with arbitrarily small errors -- so long as $|x-y|\gtrsim vt$, where $v$ is finite.
Yet most non-relativistic physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions:
two degrees of freedom separated by a distance $r$ interact with potential energy $V(r) \propto
1/r^{\alpha}$. In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously establish a hierarchy
of linear light cones: at the same $\alpha$, some quantum information processing tasks are constrained
by a linear light cone while others are not. In one spatial dimension, this linear light cone exists
for every many-body state when $\alpha>3$ (Lieb-Robinson light cone); for a typical state chosen
uniformly at random from the Hilbert space when $\alpha>\frac{5}{2}$ (Frobenius light cone);
for every state of a non-interacting system when $\alpha>2$ (free light cone). These bounds apply
to time-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our theorems regarding
the Lieb-Robinson and free light cones -- and their tightness -- also generalize to arbitrary dimensions.
We discuss the implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of topological
order, the clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the digital simulation of systems
with long-range interactions. In addition, we show that universal quantum state transfer, as well
as many-body quantum chaos, are bounded by the Frobenius light cone, and therefore are poorly constrained
by all Lieb-Robinson bounds.
