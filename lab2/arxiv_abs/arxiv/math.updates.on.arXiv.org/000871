We consider the Laplacian $\Delta$ on an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold $X$, as defined by
Mazzeo and Melrose. We give pointwise bounds on the spectral measure for the operator $(\Delta -
n^2/4)_+^{1/2}$ on such manifolds, under the assumptions that $X$ is nontrapping and there is no
resonance at the bottom of the spectrum. This uses the construction of the resolvent given by Mazzeo
and Melrose (valid when the spectral parameter lies in a compact set), Melrose, S\'{a} Barreto and
Vasy (high energy estimates for a perturbation of the hyperbolic metric) and the present authors
(see also the work by Yiran Wang) in the general high-energy case. Under the additional assumption
that $X$ has negative curvature everywhere, we give two applications of the spectral measure estimates.
The first, following work due to Guillarmou and Sikora with the second author in the asymptotically
conic case, is a restriction theorem, that is, a $L^p(X) \to L^{p'}(X)$ operator norm bound on the
spectral measure. The second is a spectral multiplier result, that is, a bound on functions $F((\Delta
- n^2/4)_+^{1/2})$ of the square root of the Laplacian, in terms of norms of the function $F$. Compared
to the asymptotically conic case, our spectral multiplier result is weaker, but the restriction
estimate is stronger. In both cases, the difference can be traced to the exponential volume growth
at infinity for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as opposed to polynomial growth in the asymptotically
conic setting. The pointwise bounds on the spectral measure established here will also be applied
to Strichartz estimates in another work by the first author.
