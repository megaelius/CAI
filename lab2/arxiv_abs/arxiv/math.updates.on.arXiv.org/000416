We consider two closely related problems: planted clustering and submatrix localization. The
planted clustering model assumes that a graph is generated from some unknown clusters by randomly
placing edges between nodes according to their cluster memberships; the task is to recover the clusters
given the graph. Special cases include the classical planted clique, planted densest subgraph,
planted partition and planted coloring problems. In the submatrix localization problem, also
known as bi-clustering, the goal is to locate hidden submatrices with elevated means inside a large
random matrix. Of particular interest is the setting where the number of clusters/submatrices
is allowed to grow unbounded with the problem size. We consider both the statistical and computational
aspects of these two problems, and prove the following. The space of the model parameters can be partitioned
into four disjoint regions corresponding to decreasing statistical and computational complexities:
(1) the "impossible" regime, where all algorithms fail; (2) the "hard" regime, where the exponential-time
Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) succeeds; (3) the "easy" regime, where the polynomial-time
convexified MLE succeeds; (4) the "simple" regime, where a simple counting/thresholding procedure
succeeds. Moreover, we show that each of these algorithms provably fails in the previous harder
regimes. Our theorems establish the first minimax recovery results for the two problems with unbounded
numbers of clusters/submatrices, and provide the best known guarantees achievable by polynomial-time
algorithms. These results demonstrate the tradeoffs between statistical and computational considerations.
