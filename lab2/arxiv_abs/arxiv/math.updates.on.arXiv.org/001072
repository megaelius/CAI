We study a conceptual model for the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system that was first introduced
by Ghil et al. This model takes the form of a delay differential equation for the thermocline (a proxy
for sea-surface temperature) at the eastern boundary of the equatorial Pacific Ocean subject to
seasonal forcing and a negative delayed feedback loop created by ocean-atmosphere coupling. The
delay in the feedback loop is due to the finite velocities of oceanic waves that propagate across
the Pacific Ocean. The model has been shown in previous work to be capable of producing qualitatively
realistic behaviour, which is organised by resonances between the external forcing and dynamics
induced by feedback. For certain parameter values, we observe in simulations the sudden disappearance
of (two-frequency dynamics on) tori. This can be explained by the folding of invariant tori and their
associated resonance tongues. It is known that two smooth tori cannot simply meet and merge; they
must actually break up in complicated bifurcation scenarios that are organised within so-called
resonance bubbles first studied by Chenciner. We identify and analyse such a Chenciner bubble in
the ENSO model. In order to understand the dynamics at folds of tori, we conduct a bifurcation analysis
of the Chenciner bubble by means of continuation software and dedicated simulations. Some bifurcations
involve tori and they are detected in appropriate two-dimensional projections associated with
Poincar\'e sections. We find close agreement between the observed bifurcation structure in the
Chenciner bubble and a previously suggested theoretical picture. As far as we are aware, this is
the first time Chenciner bubbles have been analysed in a delay differential equation. Following
our analysis, we briefly discuss the possible role of folding tori and Chenciner bubbles in the context
of climate tipping.
