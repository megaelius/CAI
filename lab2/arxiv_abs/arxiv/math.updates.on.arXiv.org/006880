This work examines the problem of graph learning over a diffusion network when data can be collected
from a limited portion of the network (partial observability). The main question is to establish
technical guarantees of consistent recovery of the subgraph of probed network nodes, i) despite
the presence of unobserved nodes; and ii) under different connectivity regimes, including the
dense regime where the probed nodes are influenced by many connections coming from the unobserved
ones. We ascertain that suitable estimators of the combination matrix (i.e., the matrix that quantifies
the pairwise interaction between nodes) possess an identifiability gap that enables the discrimination
between connected and disconnected nodes. Fundamental conditions are established under which
the subgraph of monitored nodes can be recovered, with high probability as the network size increases,
through universal clustering algorithms. This claim is proved for three matrix estimators: i)
the Granger estimator that adapts to the partial observability setting the solution that is exact
under full observability ; ii) the one-lag correlation matrix; and iii) the residual estimator
based on the difference between two consecutive time samples. A detailed characterization of the
asymptotic behavior of these estimators is established in terms of an error bias and of the identifiability
gap, and a sample complexity analysis is performed to establish how the number of samples scales
with the network size to achieve consistent learning. Comparison among the estimators is performed
through illustrative examples that show how estimators that are not optimal in the full observability
regime can outperform the Granger estimator in the partial observability regime. The analysis
reveals that the fundamental property enabling consistent graph learning is the statistical concentration
of node degrees.
