We completely determine the structure constants between real root vectors in a rank 2 Kac--Moody
algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Our description is computationally efficient, even in the rank 2 hyperbolic
case where the coefficients of roots on the root lattice grow exponentially with height. Our approach
is to extend Carter's method of finding structure constants from those on extraspecial pairs to
the rank 2 Kac--Moody case. We also determine all commutator relations involving only real root
vectors in all rank 2 Kac-Moody algebras. The generalized Cartan matrix of $\mathfrak{g}$ is of
the form $H(a,b)= \left(\begin{smallmatrix} ~2 & -b\\ -a & ~2 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ where
$a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $ab\geq 4$. If $ab=4$, then $\mathfrak{g}$ is of affine type. If $ab>4$,
then $\mathfrak{g}$ is of hyperbolic type. Explicit knowledge of the root strings is needed, as
well as a characterization of the pairs of real roots whose sums are real. We prove that if $a$ and $b$
are both greater than one, then no sum of real roots can be a real root. We determine the root strings
between real roots $\beta,\gamma$ in $H(a,1)$, $a\geq 5$ and we determine the sets $(\mathbb{Z}_{\geq
0}\alpha+\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\beta)\cap\Delta^{\text{re}}(H(a,b))$. One of our tools is a
characterization of the root subsystems generated by a subset of roots. We classify these subsystems
in rank 2 Kac--Moody root systems. We prove that every rank two infinite root system contains an infinite
family of non-isomorphic symmetric rank 2 hyperbolic root subsystems $H(k,k)$ for certain $k\geq
3$, generated by either two short or two long simple roots. We also prove that a non-symmetric hyperbolic
root systems $H(a,b)$ with $a\ne b$ and $ab>5$ also contains an infinite family of non-isomorphic
non-symmetric rank 2 hyperbolic root subsystems $H(a\ell,b\ell)$, for certain positive integers
$\ell$.
