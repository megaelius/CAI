In this paper, the problem of dynamical deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped
with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities for optimizing the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled
networks is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications
and illumination to service ground users. Since ambient illumination increases the interference
over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the UAVs, it is necessary to consider
the illumination distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem
is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV deployment, user association,
and power efficiency while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of users.
To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the machine learning framework of gated recurrent
units (GRUs) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Using GRUs and CNNs, the UAVs
can model the long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future illumination
distribution. Given the prediction of illumination distribution, the original nonconvex optimization
problem can be divided into two sub-problems and is then solved using a low-complexity, iterative
algorithm. Then, the proposed algorithm enables UAVs to determine the their deployment and user
association to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results using real data from the Earth
observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 68.9% reduction
in total transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider
the illumination distribution and user association.
