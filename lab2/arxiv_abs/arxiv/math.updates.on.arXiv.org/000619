Consensus problems for multi-agent systems in the literature have been studied under real (mostly
nonnegative) weighted networks. Complex-valued systems can be used to model many phenomena in
applications including complex-valued signals and the motion in a plane. A natural question that
arises is whether we can establish consensus under complex-weighted networks in some sense. In
this paper, we provide a positive answer to this question. More precisely, we show that in a complex-weighted
network all agents can achieve modulus consensus in which the states of all agents reach the same
modulus. Necessary and sufficient conditions for modulus consensus are given in both continuous-time
and discrete-time cases, which explicitly reveal how the connectedness of networks and structural
properties of complex weights jointly affect modulus consensus. As a special case, the bipartite
consensus problems on signed networks are revisited. Moreover, our modulus consensus results
are used to study circular formation problems in a plane. We first study the control problem of circular
formation with relative positions that requires all the agents converge to a common circle centered
at a given point and are distributed along the circle in a desired pattern, expressed by the prespecified
angle separations and ordering among agents. It is shown that the circular formation with relative
positions can be achieved if and only if the communication digraph has a spanning tree. It has the
unspecified radius and absolute phases. To completely determine the circular formation, we discuss
the control problem of circular formation with absolute positions. By using the pinning control
strategy, we find that the circular formation with absolute positions can be achieved via a single
local controller if and only if the communication digraph has a spanning tree.
