Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are devices that employ electroactive bacteria to perform
extracellular electron transfer, enabling hydrogen generation from biodegradable substrates.
In our previous work, we developed and analyzed a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model
for MECs. The model consists of ordinary differential equations (ODE) resembling chemostats or
continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), an ODE for an extracellular mediator involved in electron
transfer, and an algebraic constraint for electric current and hydrogen production. Our goal is
to determine the outcome of competition between methanogenic archaea and electroactive bacteria,
because only the latter contribute to both electric current and correlated hydrogen production.
We investigate asymptotic stability in two industrially relevant versions of the model. An important
aspect of many chemostat models is the principle of competitive exclusion, which states that only
the microorganisms which can grow at the lowest substrate concentration will survive. We show that
if methanogens can grow at the lowest substrate concentration, then the equilibrium corresponding
to competitive exclusion by methanogens is globally stable. The analogous result for electroactive
bacteria is not necessarily true. We show that local asymptotic stability of competitive exclusion
by electroactive bacteria is not guaranteed, even in a simplified model. In this case, even if electroactive
bacteria can grow at the lowest substrate concentration, a few additional conditions are required
to guarantee local stability. We also provide numerical simulations supporting these arguments.
Our results suggest operating conditions that are most conducive to success of electroactive bacteria
and current or hydrogen production in MECs. This will help identify when methane production or electricity
and hydrogen production are favored.
