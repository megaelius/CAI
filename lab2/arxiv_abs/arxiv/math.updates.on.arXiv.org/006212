We study incidences between points and algebraic curves in three dimensions, taken from a family
$C$ of curves that have almost two degrees of freedom, meaning that every pair of curves intersect
in $O(1)$ points, for any pair of points $p$, $q$, there are only $O(1)$ curves of $C$ that pass through
both points, and a pair $p$, $q$ of points admit a curve of $C$ that passes through both of them iff $F(p,q)=0$
for some polynomial $F$. We study two specific instances, one involving unit circles in $R^3$ that
pass through some fixed point (so called anchored unit circles), and the other involving tangencies
between directed points (points and directions) and circles in the plane; a directed point is tangent
to a circle if the point lies on the circle and the direction is the tangent direction. A lifting transformation
of Ellenberg et al. maps these tangencies to incidences between points and curves in three dimensions.
In both instances the curves in $R^3$ have almost two degrees of freedom. We show that the number of
incidences between $m$ points and $n$ anchored unit circles in $R^3$, as well as the number of tangencies
between $m$ directed points and $n$ arbitrary circles in the plane, is $O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5}+m+n)$.
We derive a similar incidence bound, with a few additional terms, for more general families of curves
in $R^3$ with almost two degrees of freedom. The proofs follow standard techniques, based on polynomial
partitioning, but face a novel issue involving surfaces that are infinitely ruled by the respective
family of curves, as well as surfaces in a dual 3D space that are infinitely ruled by the respective
family of suitably defined dual curves. The general bound that we obtain is $O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5}+m+n)$
plus additional terms that depend on how many curves or dual curves can lie on an infinitely-ruled
surface.
