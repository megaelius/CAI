We work with a pre-$\lambda$-frame, which is an abstract elementary class (AEC) $\mathbf K$ endowed
with a collection of basic types and a non-forking relation satisfying certain natural properties
with respect to models of cardinality $\lambda$. We investigate the density of uniqueness triples
in a given pre-$\lambda$-frame $\mathfrak s$, that is, under what circumstances every basic triple
admits a non-forking extension that is a uniqueness triple. A prior result of Shelah in this direction
required weak diamond at two consecutive cardinals, strong hypotheses on the pre-$\lambda$-frame
(in particular, that it be an almost good $\lambda$-frame), as well as a constraint on the number
of models of size $\lambda^{++}$. Our main result is an improvement, both model-theoretically
and set-theoretically: Model-theoretically, we remove the constraint on the number of models
of cadinality $\lambda^{++}$. Furthermore, we assume far fewer hypotheses on the pre-$\lambda$-frame
$\mathfrak s$ (in particular, we do not require $\mathfrak s$ to satisfy the extension, uniqueness,
or symmetry properties, or any form of local character), though we do impose the amalgamation and
stability properties on $\mathbf K_{\lambda^+}$. Set-theoretically, we assume only $\diamondsuit(\lambda^+)$,
rather than weak diamond on two cardinals. As a corollary, by applying our main result to the trivial
$\lambda$-frame, it follows that in any AEC $\mathbf K$ satisfying modest hypotheses on $\mathbf
K_\lambda$ and $\mathbf K_{\lambda^+}$, the set of domination triples in $\mathbf K_\lambda$
is dense among the non-algebraic triples.
