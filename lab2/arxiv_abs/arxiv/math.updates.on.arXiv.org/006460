Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging non-invasive medical imaging modality.
It is based on feeding electrical currents into the patient, measuring the resulting voltages at
the skin, and recovering the internal conductivity distribution. The mathematical task of EIT
image reconstruction is a nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem. Therefore any EIT image reconstruction
method needs to be regularized, typically resulting in blurred images. One promising application
is stroke-EIT, or classification of stroke into either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke
involves a blood clot, preventing blood flow to a part of the brain causing a low-conductivity region.
Hemorrhagic stroke means bleeding in the brain causing a high-conductivity region. In both cases
the symptoms are identical, so a cost-effective and portable classification device is needed.
Typical EIT are not optimal for stroke-EIT because of blurriness. This paper explores the possibilities
of machine learning in improving the classification results. Two paradigms are compared: (a) learning
from the EIT data, that is Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) maps and (b) extracting robust features from
data and learning from them. The features of choice are Virtual Hybrid Edge Detection (VHED) functions
[Greenleaf {\it et al.}, Analysis \& PDE 11, 2018] that have a geometric interpretation and whose
computation from EIT data does not involve calculating a full image of the conductivity. We report
the measures of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the networks trained with EIT data and
VHED functions separately. Computational evidence based on simulated noisy EIT data suggests
that the regularized grey-box paradigm (b) leads to significantly better classification results
than the black-box paradigm (a).
