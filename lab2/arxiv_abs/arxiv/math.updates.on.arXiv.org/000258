In 1733, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in France, set the ground of geometric probability
theory by defining an enlightening problem: What is the probability that a needle thrown randomly
on a ground made of equispaced parallel strips lies on two of them? In this work, we show that the solution
to this problem, and its generalization to N dimensions, allows us to discover a quantized form of
the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma, i.e., one that combines a linear dimensionality reduction
procedure with a uniform quantization of precision \delta>0. In particular, given a finite
set S in R^N of |S| points and a distortion level \epsilon>0, as soon as M > M_0 = log(log |S|/\epsilon^2),
we can (randomly) construct a mapping from (S, \ell_2) to ((\delta Z)^M, \ell_1) that approximately
preserves the pairwise distances between the points of S. Interestingly, compared to the common
JL Lemma, the mapping is quasi-isometric and we observe both an additive and a multiplicative distortions
on the embedded distances. These two distortions, however, decay as O(\sqrt(log |S|/M)) when M
increases. Moreover, for coarse quantization, i.e., for high \delta compared to the set radius,
the distortion is mainly additive, while for small \delta we tend to a Lipschitz isometric embedding.
Finally, we show that there exists "almost" a quasi-isometric embedding of (S, \ell_2) in ((\delta
Z)^M, \ell_2). This one involves a non-linear distortion of the \ell_2-distance in S that vanishes
for distant points in this set. Noticeably, the additive distortion in this case is slower and decays
as O((\log S/M)^(1/4)).
