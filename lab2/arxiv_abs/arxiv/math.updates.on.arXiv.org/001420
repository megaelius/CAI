The Kuramoto model describes synchronization behavior among coupled oscillators and enjoys successful
application in a wide variety of fields. Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions,
i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number
of oscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however,
applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of $n$.
For these, the equilibria can be located by finding the real solutions of a system of polynomial equations
utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. However, typical methods for solving such systems
locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions give equilibria. In this paper,
we present an algorithm to locate only the real solutions of the model, thereby shortening computation
time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific
equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. The correctness
of the algorithm (that it finds only and all the equilibria) is proved rigorously. Additionally,
the algorithm can be implemented using interval methods so that the equilibria can be approximated
up to any given precision without significantly more computational effort. We also compare this
solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing
this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at
the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally,
we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which
generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.
