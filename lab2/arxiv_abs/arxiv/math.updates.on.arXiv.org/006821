Mathematical models simulate various events under different conditions, enabling an early overview
of the system to be implemented in practice, reducing the waste of resources and in less time. In project
optimization, these models play a fundamental role, allowing to obtain parameters and attributes
capable of enhancing product performance, reducing costs and operating time. These enhancements
depend on several factors, including an accurate computational modeling of the inherent characteristics
of the system. In general, such models include uncertainties in their mathematical formulations,
which affect the feasibility of the results and their practical implementation. In this work, two
different approaches capable of quantifying uncertainties during the optimization of mathematical
models are considered. In the first, robust optimization, the sensitivity of decision variables
in relation to deviations caused by external factors is evaluated. Robust solutions tend to reduce
deviations due to possible system changes. The second approach, reliability-based optimization,
measures the probability of system failure and obtains model parameters that ensures an established
level of reliability. Overall, the fundamental objective is to formulate a multi-objective optimization
problem capable of handling robust and reliability-based optimizations, to obtain solutions
that are least sensitive to external noise and that satisfy prescribed reliability levels. The
proposed formulation is analyzed by solving benchmark and chemical engineering problems. The
results show the influence of both methodologies for the analysis of uncertainties, the multi-objective
approach provides a variety of feasible optimizers, and the formulation proves to be flexible,
so that the uncertainties can be incorporated into the problem considering the needs of each project.
