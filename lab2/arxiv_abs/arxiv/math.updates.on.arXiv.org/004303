The theory of communication through coherence (CTC) proposes that brain oscillations reflect
changes in the excitability of neurons, and therefore the successful communication between two
oscillating neural populations depends not only on the strength of the signal emitted but also on
the relative phases between them. More precisely, effective communication occurs when the emitting
and receiving populations are properly phase locked so the inputs sent by the emitting population
arrive at the phases of maximal excitability of the receiving population. To study this setting,
we consider a population rate model consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cells modelling the
receiving population, and we perturb it with a time-dependent periodic function modelling the
input from the emitting population. We consider the stroboscopic map for this system and compute
numerically the fixed and periodic points of this map and their bifurcations as the amplitude and
the frequency of the perturbation are varied. From the bifurcation diagram, we identify the phase-locked
states as well as different regions of bistability. We explore carefully the dynamics emphasizing
its implications for the CTC theory. In particular, we study how the input gain depends on the timing
between the input and the inhibitory action of the receiving population. Our results show that naturally
an optimal phase locking for CTC emerges, and provide a mechanism by which the receiving population
can implement selective communication. Moreover, the presence of bistable regions, suggests
a mechanism by which different communication regimes between brain areas can be established without
changing the structure of the network
