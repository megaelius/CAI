We consider a generalized two-color Polya urn (black and withe balls) first introduced by Hill,
Lane, Sudderth where the urn composition evolves as follows: let $\pi:\left[0,1\right]\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]$,
and denote by $x_{n}$ the fraction of black balls after step $n$, then at step $n+1$ a black ball is
added with probability $\pi\left(x_{n}\right)$ and a white ball is added with probability $1-\pi\left(x_{n}\right)$.
Originally introduced to mimic attachment under imperfect information, this model has found applications
in many fields, ranging from Market Share modeling to polymer physics and biology. In this work we
discuss large deviations for a wide class of continuous urn functions $\pi$. In particular, we prove
that this process satisfies a Sample-Path Large Deviations principle, also providing a variational
representation for the rate function. Then, we derive a variational representation for the limit
$\phi\left(s\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\textstyle \frac{1}{n}}\log\mathbb{P}\left(\left\{
nx_{n}=\left\lfloor sn\right\rfloor \right\} \right),\, s\in\left[0,1\right]$, where $nx_{n}$
is the number of black balls at time $n$, and use it to give some insight on the shape of $\phi\left(s\right)$.
Under suitable assumptions on $\pi$ we are able to identify the optimal trajectory. We also find
a non-linear Cauchy problem for the Cumulant Generating Function and provide an explicit analysis
for some selected examples. In particular we discuss the linear case, which embeds the Bagchi-Pal
Model, giving the exact implicit expression for $\phi$ in terms of the Cumulant Generating Function.
