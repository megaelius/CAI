This paper deals with the theory of d-orthogonal polynomials and it aims to find out some sufficient
conditions for the zeros of the above polynomials to be real and simple using Darboux factorization
together with the properties of totally positive matrices. We shall show that such condition exists
and it demands for the recurrence coefficients to be strict positive. The so-called co-polynomials
are deeply investigated and they explicitly expressed in terms of the basic solutions. Some of them
are used to determine the entries of the matrices in LU and UL decomposition of Jacobi matrix. The
last one gives rise of a d-analogue of kernel polynomials with quite a few properties, and further
a new characterization of the d-quasi-orthogonality. Kernel polynomials also appear in the (d+1)-decomposition
of a d-symmetric sequence. Exploiting properties of d-symmetric sequences, reveal a simple proof
of Darboux factorizations. It terms out that Jacobi matrix for d-OPS is a product of d lower bidiagonal
matrices and one upper bidiagonal matrix and that each lower bidiagonal matrix is in fact a closed
connection between two adjacent components for some d-(symmetric)OPS. Furthermore, we pointed
out that if the first component is classical d-OPS then the corresponding d-symmetric sequence
as well as all the components are classical d-OPS as well. New identities and formulas related to
determinants with d-OPS entries are obtained. Accordingly, further determinants bring out partial
generalizations of Christoffel Darboux formula. Oscillation matrices assert that zeros of d-OPS
are positive and simple whenever the recurrence coefficients are strict positive. Further interlacing
properties are justified by the same approach. Zeros of some known families of d-OPS are discussed.
