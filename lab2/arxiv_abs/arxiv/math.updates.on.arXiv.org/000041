This note advertises the theory of cellular sheaves and cosheaves, which are devices for conducting
linear algebra parametrized by a cell complex. The theory is presented in a way that is meant to be
read and appreciated by a broad audience, including those who hope to use the theory in applications
across science and engineering disciplines. We relay two approaches to cellular cosheaves. One
relies on heavy stratification theory and MacPherson's entrance path category. The other uses
the Alexandrov topology on posets. We develop applications to persistent homology, network coding,
and sensor networks to illustrate the utility of the theory. The driving computational force is
cellular cosheaf homology and sheaf cohomology. However, to interpret this computational theory,
we make use of the Remak decomposition into indecomposable representations of the cell category.
The computational formula for cellular cosheaf homology is put on the firm ground of derived categories.
This leads to an internal development of the derived perspective for cell complexes. We prove a conjecture
of MacPherson that says cellular sheaves and cosheaves are derived equivalent. Although it turns
out to be an old result, our proof is more explicit than other proofs and we make clear that Poincar\'e-Verdier
duality should be viewed as an exchange of sheaves and cosheaves. The existence of enough projectives
allows us to define a new homology theory for sheaves on posets and we establish some classical duality
results in this setting. Finally, we make use of coends as a generalized tensor product to phrase
compactly supported sheaf cohomology as the pairing with the image of the constant sheaf through
the derived equivalence.
