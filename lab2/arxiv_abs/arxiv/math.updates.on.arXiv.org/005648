The simplicial volume is a homotopy invariant of manifolds introduced by Gromov in 1982. In order
to study its main properties, Gromov himself initiated the dual theory of bounded cohomology, that
developed into an active and independent research field. Gromov's theory of bounded cohomology
was based on the use of multicomplexes, which are simplicial structures that generalize simplicial
complexes without allowing all the degeneracies appearing in simplicial sets. In the first part
of this paper we lay the foundation of the theory of multicomplexes. We construct the singular multicomplex
K(X) associated to a topological space X, and we prove that K(X) is homotopy equivalent to $X$ for
every CW complex X. Following Gromov, we introduce the notion of completeness, which translates
into the context of multicomplexes the Kan condition for simplicial sets. We then develop the homotopy
theory of complete multicomplexes. In the second part we apply the theory of multicomplexes to the
study of the bounded cohomology of topological spaces. We provide complete proofs of Gromov's Mapping
Theorem (which implies that the bounded cohomology of a space only depends on its fundamental group)
and of Gromov's Vanishing Theorem, which ensures the vanishing of the simplicial volume of closed
manifolds admitting an amenable cover of small multiplicity. The third part is devoted to the study
of locally finite chains on non-compact spaces. We expand some ideas of Gromov to provide complete
proofs of a criterion for the vanishing and a criterion for the finiteness of the simplicial volume
of open manifolds. As a by-product of these results, we prove a criterion for the l^1-invisibility
of closed manifolds in terms of amenable covers. As an application, we give the first complete proof
of the vanishing of the simplicial volume of the product of three open manifolds.
