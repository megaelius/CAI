Thirty years ago, I introduced a non commutative variant of classical linear logic, called POMSET
LOGIC, issued from a particular denotational semantics or categorical interpretation of linear
logic known as coherence spaces. In addition to the multiplicative connectives of linear logic,
pomset logic includes a non-commutative connective, "$<$" called BEFORE, which is associative
and self-dual: $(A<B)^\perp=A^\perp < B^\perp$ (observe that there is no swapping), and pomset
logic handles Partially Ordered MultiSETs of formulas. This classical calculus enjoys a proof
net calculus, cut-elimination, denotational semantics, but had no sequent calculus, despite
my many attempts and the study of closely related deductive systems like the calculus of structures.
At the same period, Alain Lecomte introduced me to Lambek calculus and grammars. We defined a grammatical
formalism based on pomset logic, with partial proof nets as the deductive systems for parsing-as-deduction,
with a lexicon mapping words to partial proof nets. The study of pomset logic and of its grammatical
applications has been out of the limelight for several years, in part because computational linguists
were not too keen on proof nets. However, recently Sergey Slavnov found a sequent calculus for pomset
logic, and reopened the study of pomset logic. In this paper we shall present pomset logic including
both published and unpublished material. Just as for Lambek calculus, Pomset logic also is a non
commutative variant of linear logic --- although Lambek calculus appeared 30 years before linear
logic ! --- and as in Lambek calculus it may be used as a grammar. Apart from this the two calculi are
quite different, but perhaps the algebraic presentation we give here, with terms and the semantic
correctness criterion, is closer to Lambek's view.
