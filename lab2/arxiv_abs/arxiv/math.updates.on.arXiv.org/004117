A novel approach to building explicit stencil computation schemes for the transient 2D scalar wave
equation is proposed and implemented. It is based on using the integral representation formula
(Poisson's formula) that provides the exact solution $u({\bf x},t)$ (where ${\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$,
$t$ is time) of the initial-value problem for the transient 2D scalar wave equation at $t>0$ through
the initial conditions for both $u$ and $v=\partial u/\partial t$. For the purpose of constructing
a two-step time-marching algorithm, an additional integral representation formula for the sum
$u({\bf x},t_*+\tau)+ u({\bf x},t_*-\tau)$ is provided, with $\tau$ being a time step and $t_*
\ge \tau$. It is shown that integrals in the two representation formulas are easily calculated if
the initial conditions and $u({\bf x},t_*)$ as functions of spatial coordinates are approximated
by stencil interpolation polynomials in the neighborhood of any point ${\bf x }_{ij}$ in a 2D Cartesian
grid $\{(ih,jh),(i,j) \in \mathbb{Z}^2\}$ where $h$ is a grid spacing. As a result, if a uniform
time grid $\{t_k=k\tau, k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is chosen, the proposed time-marching algorithm consists
of two numerical procedures: (a1) the calculation of $u({\bf x}_{ij},t_1)$, at the very first time-step,
through the initial values of both $u$ and $v$ at stencil nodes; (a2) the calculation of $u({\bf x}_{ij},t_{n+1}),n
\ge 1$, at the second and next time-steps, through a generated two-step scheme. Three computational
stencils (with 5, 9 and 13 space points) are built using the proposed approach. Their stability is
discussed. It is demonstrated by simulation that utilizing both procedures (a1) and (a2) are important
for the accuracy of stencil computations, and that using the conventional first time-step calculation
procedure instead of (a1) can lead to a significant loss of accuracy even for later time-steps.
