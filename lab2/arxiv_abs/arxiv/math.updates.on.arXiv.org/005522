Telg\'arsky's conjecture states that for each $k \in \mathbb N$, there is a topological space $X_k$
such that in the Banach-Mazur game on $X_k$, the player {\scriptsize NONEMPTY} has a winning $(k+1)$-tactic
but no winning $k$-tactic. We prove that this statement is consistently false. More specifically,
we prove, assuming $\mathsf{GCH}+\square$, that if {\scriptsize NONEMPTY} has a winning strategy
for the Banach-Mazur game on a $T_3$ space $X$, then she has a winning $2$-tactic. The proof uses a
coding argument due to Galvin, whereby if $X$ has a $\pi$-base with certain nice properties, then
{\scriptsize NONEMPTY} is able to encode, in each consecutive pair of her opponent's moves, all
essential information about the play of the game before the current move. Our proof shows that under
$\mathsf{GCH}+\square$, every $T_3$ space has a sufficiently nice $\pi$-base that enables this
coding strategy. Translated into the language of partially ordered sets, what we really show is
that $\mathsf{GCH}+\square$ implies the following statement, which is equivalent to the existence
of the "nice'' $\pi$-bases mentioned above: \emph{Every separative poset $\mathbb P$ with the
$\kappa$-cc contains a dense sub-poset $\mathbb D$ such that $|\{ q \in \mathbb D \,:\, p \text{ extends
} q \}| < \kappa$ for every $p \in \mathbb P$.} We prove that this statement is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$:
while it holds under $\mathsf{GCH}+\square$, it is false even for ccc posets if $\mathfrak{b} >
\aleph_1$. We also show that if $|\mathbb P| < \aleph_\omega$, then \axiom-for-$\mathbb P$ is a
consequence of $\mathsf{GCH}$ holding below $|\mathbb P|$.
