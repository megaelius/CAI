Let $m\ge 1$, in this paper, our object of investigation is the regularity and and continuity properties
of the following multilinear strong maximal operator $${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathcal{R}}(\vec{f})(x)=\sup_{\substack{R
\ni x \\ R\in\mathcal{R}}}\prod\limits_{i=1}^m\frac{1}{|R|}\int_{R}|f_i(y)|dy,$$ where
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathcal{R}$ denotes the family of all rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^d$
with sides parallel to the axes. When $m=1$, denote $\mathscr{M}_{\mathcal{R}}$ by $\mathcal
{M}_{\mathcal{R}}$.Then, $\mathcal {M}_{\mathcal{R}}$ coincides with the classical strong
maximal function initially studied by Jessen, Marcinkiewicz and Zygmund. We showed that ${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathcal{R}}$
is bounded and continuous from the Sobolev spaces $W^{1,p_1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times \cdots\times
W^{1,p_m}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $W^{1,p} (\mathbb{R}^d)$, from the Besov spaces $B_{s}^{p_1,q}
(\mathbb{R}^d)\times\cdots\times B_s^{p_m,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $B_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$,
from the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $F_{s}^{p_1,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times\cdots\times F_s^{p_m,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$
to $F_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. As a consequence, we further showed that ${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathcal{R}}$
is bounded and continuous from the fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p_1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times
\cdots\times W^{s,p_m}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $0<s\leq 1$ and $1<p<\infty$.
As an application, we obtain a weak type inequality for the Sobolev capacity, which can be used to
prove the $p$-quasicontinuity of $\mathscr{M}_{\mathcal{R}}$. The discrete type of the strong
maximal operators has also been considered. We showed that this discrete type of the maximal operators
enjoys somewhat unexpected regularity properties.
