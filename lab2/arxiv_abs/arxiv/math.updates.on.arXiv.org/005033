This paper continues the development of regularity results for nonlinear measure data problems
\begin{align*} \begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A(x,\nabla u)) &= \mu \quad \text{in} \ \ \Omega,
\quad \quad \qquad u &=0 \quad \text{on} \ \ \partial \Omega, \end{cases} \end{align*} in Lorentz
and Lorentz-Morrey spaces, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \ge 2$), $\mu$ is a finite Radon
measure on $\Omega$, and $A$ is a monotone Carath\'eodory vector valued operator acting between
$W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$ and its dual $W^{-1,p'}(\Omega)$. It emphasizes that this paper covers the
`very singular' case of $1<p \le \frac{3n-2}{2n-1}$ and the problem is considered under the weak
assumption that the $p$-capacity uniform thickness condition is imposed on the complement of domain
$\Omega$. There are two main results obtained in our study pertaining to the global gradient estimates
of solutions (renormalized solutions), involving the use of maximal and fractional maximal operators
in Lorentz and Lorentz-Morrey spaces, respectively. The idea for writing this working paper comes
directly from the results of others for the same research topic, where estimates for gradient of
solutions cannot be obtained for the `very singular' case, still remains a challenge. Our main goal
here is to develop results and improve methods in \cite{MPT2018, MPT2019} to the case when $1<p \le
\frac{3n-2}{2n-1}$. In order to derive the gradient estimates in Lorentz and Lorentz-Morrey spaces,
our approach is based on the good-$\lambda$ technique proposed early by Q.-H. Nguyen {\it{et al.}}
in \cite{55QH2, 55QH4} and our previous works in \cite{MPT2018, MPT2019}.
