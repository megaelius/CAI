In this paper, we introduce the general concept of coded power control (CPC) in a particular setting
of the interference channel. Roughly, the idea of CPC consists in embedding information (about
a random state) into the transmit power levels themselves: in this new framework, provided the power
levels of a given transmitter can be observed (through a noisy channels) by other transmitters,
a sequence of power levels of the former can therefore be used to coordinate the latter. To assess
the limiting performance of CPC (and therefore the potential performance brought by this new approach),
we derive, as a first step towards many extensions of the present work, a general result which not
only concerns power control (PC) but also any scenario involving two decision-makers (DMs) which
communicate through their actions and have the following information and decision structures.
We assume that the DMs want to maximize the average of an arbitrarily chosen instantaneous payoff
function which depends on the DMs' actions and the state realization. DM 1 is assumed to know non-causally
the state (e.g., the channel state) which affects the common payoff while the other, say DM 2, has
only a strictly causal knowledge of it. DM 1 can only use its own actions (e.g., power levels) to inform
DM 2 about its best action in terms of payoff. Importantly, DM 2 can only monitor the actions of DM 1
imperfectly and DM 1 does not observe DM 2. The latter assumption leads us to exploiting Shannon-theoretic
tools in order to generalize an existing theorem which provides the information constraint under
which the payoff is maximized. The derived result is then exploited to fully characterize the performance
of good CPC policies for a given instance of the interference channel.
