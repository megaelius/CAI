Let $\pi$ be a cuspidal automorphic representation of $PGL_2(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$ of arithmetic
conductor $C$ and archimedean parameter $T$, and let $\phi$ be an $L^2$-normalized automorphic
form in the space of $\pi$. The sup-norm problem asks for bounds on $\| \phi \|_\infty$ in terms of
$C$ and $T$. The quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) problem concerns the limiting behavior of the $L^2$-mass
$|\phi|^2 (g) \, d g$ of $\phi$. All previous work on these problems in the conductor-aspect has focused
on the case that $\phi$ is a newform. In this work, we study these problems for a class of automorphic
forms that are not newforms. Precisely, we assume that for each prime divisor $p$ of $C$, the local
component $\pi_p$ is supercuspidal (and satisfies some additional technical hypotheses), and
consider automorphic forms $\phi$ for which the local components $\phi_p \in \pi_p$ are "minimal"
vectors. Such vectors may be understood as non-archimedean analogues of lowest weight vectors
in holomorphic discrete series representations of $PGL_2(\mathbb{R})$. For automorphic forms
as above, we prove a sup-norm bound that is sharper than what is known in the newform case. In particular,
if $\pi_\infty$ is a holomorphic discrete series of lowest weight $k$, we obtain the optimal bound
$C^{1/8 -\epsilon} k^{1/4 - \epsilon} \ll_{\epsilon} |\phi|_\infty \ll_{\epsilon} C^{1/8 +
\epsilon} k^{1/4+\epsilon}$. We prove also that these forms give analytic test vectors for the
QUE period, thereby demonstrating the equivalence between the strong QUE and the subconvexity
problems for this class of vectors. This finding contrasts the known failure of this equivalence
for newforms of powerful level.
