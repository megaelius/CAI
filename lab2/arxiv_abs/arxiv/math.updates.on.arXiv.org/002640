Interactive, immersive and critical applications demand ultra-reliable low-latency communication
(URLLC). To build wireless communication systems that can support these applications, understanding
the characteristics of the wireless medium is paramount. Although wireless channel characteristics
and dynamics have been extensively studied, it is important to revisit these concepts in the context
of the strict demands of low latency and ultra-reliability. In this paper, we bring a modeling approach
from robust control to wireless communication -- the wireless channel characteristics are given
a nominal model around which we allow for some quantified uncertainty. We propose certain key "directions"
along which to bound model uncertainty that are relevant to URLLC. For the nominal model, we take
an in-depth look at wireless channel characteristics such as spatial and temporal correlations
based on Jakes' model. Contrary to what has been claimed in the literature, we find that standard
Rayleigh fading processes are not bandlimited. This has significant implications on the predictability
of channels. We also find that under reasonable conditions the spatial correlation of channels
provide a fading distribution that is not too far off from an independent spatial fading model. Additionally,
we look at the impact of these channel models on cooperative communication based systems. We find
that while spatial-diversity-based techniques are necessary to combat the adverse effects of
fading, time-diversity-based techniques are necessary to be robust against unmodeled errors.
Robust URLLC systems need to operate with both an SNR margin and a time/repetition margin.
