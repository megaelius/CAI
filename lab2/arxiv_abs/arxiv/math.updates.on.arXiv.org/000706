This extended summary of Dr.Sc.Comp. thesis is created to emphasis the tight connection of the proposed
spectral analysis method with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) - the most extensively studied
and frequently used approach in the history of signal processing. It is shown that in a typical application
case, where uniform data readings are transformed to the same number of uniformly spaced frequencies,
the results of the classical DFT and proposed approach coincide. The difference in performance
appears when the length of the DFT is selected to be greater than the length of the data. The DFT solves
the unknown data problem by padding readings with zeros up to the length of the DFT, while the proposed
Extended DFT (EDFT) deals with this situation in a different way, it uses the Fourier integral transform
as a target and optimizes the transform basis in the extended frequency range without putting such
restrictions on the time domain. Consequently, the Inverse DFT (IDFT) applied to the result of EDFT
returns not only known readings but also the extrapolated data, where classical DFT is able to give
back just zeros, and higher resolution is achieved at frequencies where the data has been successfully
extended. It has been shown that EDFT able to process data with missing readings or gaps inside or
even nonuniformly distributed data. Thus, EDFT significantly extends the usability of the DFT-based
methods, where previously these approaches have been considered as not applicable. The EDFT founds
the solution in an iterative way and requires repeated calculations to get the adaptive basis, and
this makes its numerical complexity much higher compared to DFT. This disadvantage was a serious
problem in the 1990s, when the method has been proposed. Fortunately, since then the power of computers
has increased so much that nowadays EDFT application could be considered as a real alternative.
