We analyze the sequence obtained by consecutive applications of the Cantor-Bendixson derivative
for a noncommutative scattered $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$, using the ideal $\mathcal I^{At}(\mathcal
A)$ generated by the minimal projections of $\mathcal A$. With its help, we present some fundamental
results concerning scattered $C^*$-algebras, in a manner parallel to the commutative case of scattered
compact or locally compact Hausdorff spaces and superatomic Boolean algebras. It also allows us
to formulate problems which have motivated the "cardinal sequences" programme in the classical
topology, in the noncommutative context. This leads to some new constructions of noncommutative
scattered $C^*$-algebras and new open problems. In particular, we construct a type $I$ $C^*$-algebra
which is the inductive limit of stable ideals $\mathcal A_\alpha$, along an uncountable limit ordinal
$\lambda$, such that $\mathcal A_{\alpha+1}/\mathcal A_\alpha$ is $*$-isomorphic to the algebra
of all compact operators on a separable Hilbert space and $\mathcal A_{\alpha+1}$ is $\sigma$-unital
and stable for each $\alpha<\lambda$, but $\mathcal A$ is not stable and where all ideals of $\mathcal
A$ are of the form $\mathcal A_\alpha$. In particular, $\mathcal A$ is a nonseparable $C^*$-algebra
with no ideal which is maximal among the stable ideals. This answers a question of M. R\ordam in the
nonseparable case. All the above $C^*$-algebras $A_\alpha$s and $A$ satisfy the following version
of the definition of an AF algebra: any finite subset can be approximated from a finite-dimensional
subalgebra. Two more complex constructions based on the language developed in this paper are presented
in separate papers.
