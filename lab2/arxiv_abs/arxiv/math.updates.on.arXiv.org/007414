An omitted value of a transcendental meromorphic function $f$ is called a Baker omitted value, in
short \textit{bov} if there is a disk $D$ centered at the bov such that each component of the boundary
of $f^{-1}(D)$ is bounded. Assuming the bov to be in the Fatou set, this article investigates the
dynamics of the function. Firstly, the connectivity of all the Fatou components are determined.
If $U$ is the Fatou component containing the bov then it is proved that a Fatou component $U'$ is infinitely
connected if and only if it lands on $U$, i.e. $f^{k}(U') \subset U$ for some $k \geq 1$. Every other
Fatou component is either simply connected or lands on a Herman ring. Further, assuming that the
number of critical points in the Fatou set whose forward orbit does not intersect $U$ is finite, we
have shown that the connectivity of each Fatou component belongs to a finite set independent of the
Fatou components. It is proved that the Fatou component containing the bov is completely invariant
whenever it is forward invariant. Further, if the invariant Fatou component is an attracting domain
and contains all the critical values of the function then the Julia set is totally disconnected.
Baker domains are shown to be non-existent. It is also proved that, if there is a $2$-periodic Baker
domain, or a $2$-periodic attracting or parabolic domain containing the bov then the function has
no Herman ring. Some examples exhibiting different possibilities for the Fatou set are discussed.
This includes the first example of a meromorphic function with an omitted value which has two infinitely
connected Fatou components.
