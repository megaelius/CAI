This is a collection of the lecture notes of the three authors for a first-year graduate course on
control system theory and design (ECE 515 , formerly ECE 415) at the ECE Department of the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This is a fundamental course on the modern theory of dynamical
systems and their control, and builds on a first-level course in control that emphasizes frequency-domain
methods (such as the course ECE 486 , formerly ECE 386, at UIUC ). The emphasis in this graduate course
is on state space techniques, and it encompasses modeling , analysis (of structural properties
of systems, such as stability, controllability, and observability), synthesis (of observers/compensators
and controllers) subject to design specifications, and optimization . Accordingly, this set of
lecture notes is organized in four parts, with each part dealing with one of the issues identified
above. Concentration is on linear systems , with nonlinear systems covered only in some specific
contexts, such as stability and dynamic optimization. Both continuous-time and discrete-time
systems are covered, with the former, however, in much greater depth than the latter. The main objective
of this course is to teach the student some fundamental principles within a solid conceptual framework,
that will enable her/him to design feedback loops compatible with the information available on
the "states" of the system to be controlled, and by taking into account considerations such as stability,
performance, energy conservation, and even robustness. A second objective is to familiarize her/him
with the available modern computational, simulation, and general software tools that facilitate
the design of effective feedback loops
