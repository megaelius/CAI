We describe an algorithm for computing the homology $H_n(X,A)$ and cohomology $H^n(X,A)$ of a finite
connected CW-complex X with local coefficients in a $\mathbb Z\pi_1X$-module $A$ when $A$ is finitely
generated over $\mathbb Z$. It can be used, in particular, to compute the integral cohomology $H^n(\widetilde
X_H,\mathbb Z)$ and induced homomorphism $H^n(X,\mathbb Z) \rightarrow H^n(\widetilde X_H,\mathbb
Z)$ for the covering map $p\colon \widetilde X_H \rightarrow X$ associated to a finite index subgroup
$H < \pi_1X$, as well as the corresponding homology homomorphism. We illustrate an open-source
implementation of the algorithm by using it to show that: (i) the degree $2$ homology group $H_2(\widetilde
X_H,\mathbb Z)$ distinguishes between the homotopy types of the complements $X\subset \mathbb
R^4$ of the spun Hopf link and Satoh's tube map of the welded Hopf link (these two complements having
isomorphic fundamental groups and integral homology); (ii) the degree $1$ homology homomorphism
$H_1(p^{-1}(B),\mathbb Z) \rightarrow H_1(\widetilde X_H,\mathbb Z)$ distinguishes between
the homeomorphism types of the complements $X\subset \mathbb R^3$ of the granny knot and the reef
knot, where $B\subset X$ is the knot boundary (these two complements again having isomorphic fundamental
groups and integral homology). We conclude the paper with an explanation of how the cohomology algorithm
provides an approach to computing the set $[W,X]_\phi$ of based homotopy classes of maps $f\colon
W\rightarrow X$ of finite CW-complexes over a fixed group homomorphism $\pi_1f=\phi$ in the case
where $\dim W =n$, $\pi_1X$ is finite and $\pi_iX=0$ for $2\le i\le n-1$.
