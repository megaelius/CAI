In 1975 Figari, H{\o}egh-Krohn and Nappi constructed the P(phi)_2 model on the de Sitter space.
Here we complement their work with new results, as well as by connecting this model to various areas
of mathematics. In particular, i.) we discuss the causal structure of de Sitter space and the induces
representations of the Lorentz group. We show that the UIRs of SO_0(1,2) for both the principal and
the complementary series can be formulated on Hilbert spaces whose functions are supported on a
Cauchy surface, ii.) we describe the free classical dynamical system in both its covariant and canonical
form, and present the associated quantum one-particle KMS structures in the sense of Kay, iii.)
we discuss the localisation properties of one-particle wave functions and how these properties
are inherited by the algebras of local observables. In addition, we describe the relations between
the modular objects (in the sense of Tomita-Takesaki theory) associated to wedge algebras and the
representations of the Lorentz group, iv.) we connect the representations of SO(1,2) to unitary
representations of SO(3) on the Euclidean sphere, and discuss how the P(phi)_2 interaction can
be represented by a rotation invariant vector in the Euclidean Fock space. We present a novel Osterwalder-Schrader
reconstruction theorem, which shows that physical infrared problems are absent on de Sitter space,
v.) we explain how the generators of the boosts and the rotations for the interacting quantum field
theory arise arise from the stress-energy tensor. Finally, we show that the interacting quantum
fields satisfy the equations of motion in their covariant form. In summary, we argue that the de Sitter
P(phi)_2 model is the simplest and most explicit relativistic quantum field theory, which satisfies
basic expectations, like covariance, particle creation, stability and finite speed of light.
