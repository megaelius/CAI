The classical Galois theory deals with certain finite algebraic extensions and establishes a bijective
order reversing correspondence between the intermediate fields and the subgroups of a group of
permutations called the Galois group of the extension. It has been the dream of many mathematicians
at the end of the nineteenth century to generalize these results to systems of algebraic partial
differential (PD) equations and the corresponding finitely generated differential extensions,
in order to be able to add the word differential in front of any classical statement. The achievement
of the Picard-Vessiot theory by E. Kolchin between 1950 and 1970 is now well known. The purpose of
this paper is to sketch the general theory for such differential extensions and algebraic pseudogroups
by means of new methods mixing differential algebra, differential geometry and algebraic geometry.
As already discovered by E. Vessiot in 1904 through the use of automorphic systems, a concept never
acknowledged, the main point is to notice that the Galois theory (old and new) is mainly a study of
principal homogeneous spaces (PHS) for algebraic groups or pseudogroups. Hence, all the formal
theory of PD equations developped by D.C. Spencer around 1970 must be used together with modern algebraic
geometry, in particular tensor products of rings and fields. However, the combination of these
new tools is not sufficient and we have to create the analogue for Lie pseudogroups of the so-called
invariant derivations introduced by A. Bialynicki-Birula after 1960 in the study of algebraic
groups and fields with derivations. We shall finally prove the usefulness of the resulting differential
Galois theory through striking applications to mechanics, revisiting shell theory, chain theory,
the Frenet-Serret formulas and the integration of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
