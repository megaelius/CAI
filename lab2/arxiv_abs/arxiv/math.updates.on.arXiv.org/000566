Let ${\cal T}=(T,w)$ be a weighted finite tree with leaves $1,..., n$. For any $I :=\{i_1,..., i_k
\} \subset \{1,...,n\}$, let $D_I ({\cal T})$ be the weight of the minimal subtree of $T$ connecting
$i_1,..., i_k$; the $D_{I} ({\cal T})$ are called $k$-weights of ${\cal T}$. Given a family of real
numbers parametrized by the $k$-subsets of $\{1,..., n\}$, $\{D_I\}_{I \in {\{1,...,n\} \choose
k}}$, we say that a weighted tree ${\cal T}=(T,w)$ with leaves $1,..., n$ realizes the family if $D_I({\cal
T})=D_I$ for any $ I \in {\{1,...,n\} \choose k}$. Pachter and Speyer proved that, if $3 \leq k \leq
(n+1)/2$ and $\{D_I\}_{I \in {\{1,...,n\} \choose k}}$ is a family of positive real numbers, then
there exists at most one positive-weighted essential tree ${\cal T}$ with leaves $1,...,n$, that
realizes the family ("essential" means that there are no vertices of degree $2$). We say that a tree
$P$ with leaves $1,.., n$ is an $r$-pseudostar if any edge of $P$ divides $\{1,...,n\}$ into two sets
such that at least one of them has cardinality $ \leq r$. Here we show that, if $4 \leq k \leq n-2$ and
$\{D_I\}_{I \in {\{1,...,n\} \choose k}}$ is a family of positive real numbers, there is at most
one positive-weighted essential $(n-k)$-pseudostar ${\cal P}=(P,w)$, with leaves $1,...,n$,
that realizes the family; moreover we describe how any other positive-weighted tree realizing
the family can be obtained from ${\cal P}$. We find an analogous result for families of real numbers
and weighted essential pseudostars with nonzero weights. Furthermore, we give a characterization
of the families that are realized by some weighted tree. Finally we examine the range of the total
weight of the weighted trees realizing a fixed family.
