In Part I, crotons are introduced, multifaceted pre-geometric objects that occur both as labels
encoded on the boundary of a "volume" and as complementary aspects of geometric fluctuations within
that volume. If you think of crotons as linear combinations, then the scalars used are croton base
numbers. Croton base numbers can be combined to form the amplitudes and phases of Mersenne fluctuations
which, in turn, form qphyla. Volume normally requires space or space-time as a prerequisite; in
a pregeometric setting, however, "volume" is represented by a qphyletic assembly. Various stages
of pre-geometric refinement, expressed through the aspects crotonic amplitude or phase, combine
to eventually form and/or dissolve sphere-packed chunks of Euclidean space. A time-like crotonic
refinement is a rough analog of temporal resolution in tenacious time, whereas space-like crotonic
refinement is analogous to spatial resolution in sustained space. The analogy suggests a conceptual
link between the ever-expanding scope of Mersenne fluctuations and the creation and lifetime patterns
of massive elementary particles. A three-stage process of ideation, organization and intraworldly
action is introduced to back this up. In Part II, the intrawordly aspect is analyzed first, including
our preon model of subnuclear structure, and the organizer aspect thereafter, based on three types
of Mersenne numbers, $M_{\textrm{reg}}$, $M_{5/8}$, $M_{9/8}$, and two formal principles: juxtaposition
$x$ vs. $\! x\!\pm\!1(2)$ and the interordinal application of functional $1\!\divideontimes(f^{(a)}\!\circ(f^{(b)}\!\divideontimes
f^{(c)}))$.
