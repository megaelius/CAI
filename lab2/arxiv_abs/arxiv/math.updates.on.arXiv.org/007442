In his classical textbook on algebraic topology Edwin Spanier developed the theory of covering
spaces within a more general framework of lifting spaces (i.e., Hurewicz fibrations with unique
path-lifting property). Among other, Spanier proved that for every space $X$ there exists a universal
lifting space, which however need not be simply connected, unless the base space $X$ is semi-locally
simply connected. The question on what exactly is the fundamental group of the universal space was
left unanswered. The main source of lifting spaces are inverse limits of covering spaces over $X$,
or more generally, over some inverse system of spaces converging to $X$. Every metric space $X$ can
be obtained as a limit of an inverse system of polyhedra, and so inverse limits of covering spaces
over the system yield lifting spaces over $X$. They are related to the geometry (in particular the
fundamental group) of $X$ in a similar way as the covering spaces over polyhedra are related to the
fundamental group of their base. Thus lifting spaces appear as a natural replacement for the concept
of covering spaces over base spaces with bad local properties. In this paper we develop a general
theory of lifting spaces and prove that they are preserved by products, inverse limits and other
important constructions. We show that maps from $X$ to polyhedra give rise to coverings over $X$
and use that to prove that for a connected, locally path connected and paracompact $X$, the fundamental
group of the above-mentioned Spanier's universal space is precisely the intersection of all Spanier
groups associated to open covers of $X$, and that the later coincides with the shape kernel of $X$.
Furthermore, we examine in more detail lifting spaces over $X$ that arise as inverse limits of coverings
over some approximations of $X$.
