We investigate the interplay between two fundamental mechanisms of microbial population dynamics
and evolution called dormancy and horizontal gene transfer. The corresponding traits come in many
guises and are ubiquitous in microbial communities, affecting their dynamics in important ways.
Recently, they have each moved (separately) into the focus of stochastic individual-based modelling
(Billiard et al. 2016, 2018; Champagnat, M\'el\'eard and Tran, 2019; Blath and T\'obi\'as 2019).
Here, we examine their combined effects in a unified model. Indeed, we consider the (idealized)
scenario of two sub-populations, respectively carrying 'trait 1' and 'trait 2', where trait 1 individuals
are able to switch (under competitive pressure) into a dormant state, and trait 2 individuals are
able to execute horizontal gene transfer, turning trait 1 individuals into trait 2 ones, at a rate
depending on the frequency of individuals. In the large-population limit, we examine the fate of
a single trait $i$ individual (a 'mutant') arriving in a trait $j$ resident population living in
equilibrium, for $i,j=1,2, i \neq j$. We provide a complete analysis of the invasion dynamics in
all cases where the resident population is individually fit and the initial behaviour of the mutant
population is non-critical. We identify parameter regimes for the invasion and fixation of the
new trait, stable coexistence of the two traits, and 'founder control' (where the initial resident
always dominates, irrespective of its trait). The most striking result is that stable coexistence
occurs in certain scenarios even if trait 2 (which benefits from transfer at the cost of trait 1) would
be unfit when being merely on its own. In the case of founder control, the limiting dynamical system
has an unstable coexistence equilibrium. In all cases, we observe the classical (up to 3) phases
of invasion dynamics \`a la Champagnat (2006).
