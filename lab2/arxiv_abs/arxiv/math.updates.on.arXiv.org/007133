Research on infodemics, i.e., the rapid spread of (mis)information related to a hazardous event
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires the integration of a multiplicity of scientific disciplines.
The dynamics emerging from infodemics have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns.
For the field of Business and Economics, understanding these dynamics is of ultimate importance:
it supports, for example, anticipating individual behavior, which might help reduce the uncertainty
entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic and allows for assessing the efficiency of policy decisions to
contain its effects. In addition to the field of Business and Economics, we take into account the
following disciplines: Through the lens of Computer Science and Information Systems, the information
accessible to individuals is central, whereby the way information spreads in a society is strongly
affected by the employed algorithms for information provision and by personalization. From the
perspective of Linguistics, specific language signals in communication which emerge during pandemics
have to be taken into account (e.g., emotion-related words, avoiding causal terms). Considering
linguistic patterns in the context of infodemics appears to be highly relevant as they strongly
affect how information is interpreted, fact-checked, made sense of by non-expert persons, and
the way misinformation is automatically detected. From a Cognitive Psychology point of view, the
focus is on how motives, intuition and affect influence the search and evaluation of information,
and on how cognitive processes, the digital information environment and linguistic patterns together
shape individuals' understanding of critical events, risk perception and behavior. The perspective
of Business and Economics allows for integrating these perspectives into the wider context of economic
systems (e.g., organizations or the society).
