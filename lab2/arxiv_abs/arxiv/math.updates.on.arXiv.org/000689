This paper studies the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a multiuser
wireless system, in which distributed transmitters send independent messages to their respective
receivers, and at the same time cooperatively transmit wireless power to the receivers via energy
beamforming. Accordingly, from the wireless information transmission (WIT) perspective, the
system of interest can be modeled as the classic interference channel, while it also can be regarded
as a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for collaborative wireless energy
transmission (WET). To enable both information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) in SWIPT,
we adopt the low-complexity time switching operation at each receiver to switch between the ID and
EH modes over scheduled time. Based on this hybrid model, we aim to characterize the achievable rate-energy
(R-E) trade-offs in the multiuser SWIPT system under various transmitter-side collaboration
schemes. Specifically, to facilitate the collaborative energy beamforming, we propose a new signal
splitting scheme at the transmitters, where each transmit signal is generally composed of an information
signal component and an energy signal component for WIT and WET, respectively. With this new scheme,
first, we study the two-user SWIPT system and derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receivers
and the corresponding transmit signal optimization to achieve various R-E trade-offs over the
fading channel. We also compare the R-E performance of our proposed scheme with transmit energy
beamforming and signal splitting against two existing schemes with partial or no cooperation of
the transmitters, and show remarkable gains over these baseline schemes. Finally, the general
case of SWIPT systems with more than two users is studied, for which we propose and compare two practical
transmit collaboration schemes.
