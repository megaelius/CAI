Simple Hurwitz numbers enumerate branched morphisms between Riemann surfaces with fixed ramification
data. In recent years, several variants of this notion for genus $0$ base curves have appeared in
the literature. Among them are so-called monotone Hurwitz numbers, which are related to the HCIZ
integral in random matrix theory and strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers which count certain Grothendieck
dessins d'enfants. We generalise the notion of Hurwitz numbers to interpolations between simple,
monotone and strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers to any genus and any number of arbitrary but fixed
ramification profiles. This yields generalisations of several results known for Hurwitz numbers.
When the target surface is of genus one, we show that the generating series of these interpolated
Hurwitz numbers are quasimodular forms. In the case that all ramification is simple, we refine this
result by writing this series as a sum of quasimodular forms corresonding to tropical covers weighted
by Gromov-Witten invariants. Moreover, we derive a quantum curve for monotone and Grothendieck
dessins d'enfants Hurwitz numbers for arbitrary genera and one arbitrary but fixed ramification
profile. Thus, we obtain spectral curves via the semiclassical limit as input data for the CEO topological
recursion. Astonishingly, we find that the CEO topological recursion for the genus $1$ spectral
curve of the strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers compute the monotone Hurwitz numbers in genus $0$.
Thus, we give a new proof that monotone Hurwitz numbers satisfy CEO topological recursion. This
points to an unknown relation between those enumerants. Finally, specializing to target surface
$\mathbb{P}^1$, we find recursions for monotone and Grothendieck dessins d'enfants double Hurwitz
numbers, which enables the computation of the respective Hurwitz numbers for any genera with one
arbitrary but fixed ramification profile.
