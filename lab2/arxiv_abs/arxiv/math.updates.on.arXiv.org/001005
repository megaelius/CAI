Suszko's problem is the problem of finding the minimal number of truth values needed to semantically
characterize a syntactic consequence relation. Suszko proved that every Tarskian consequence
relation can be characterized using only two truth values. Malinowski showed that this number can
equal three if some of Tarski's structural constraints are relaxed. By so doing, Malinowski introduced
a case of so-called mixed consequence, allowing the notion of a designated value to vary between
the premises and the conclusions of an argument. In this paper we give a more systematic perspective
on Suszko's problem and on mixed consequence. First, we prove general representation theorems
relating structural properties of a consequence relation to their semantic interpretation, uncovering
the semantic counterpart of substitution-invariance, and establishing that mixed consequence
is fundamentally the semantic counterpart of the structural property of monotonicity. We use those
to derive maximum-rank results proved recently by French and Ripley in a different setting for logics
with various structural properties (reflexivity, transitivity, none, or both). We strengthen
these results into exact rank results for non-permeable logics (roughly, those which distinguish
the role of premises and conclusions). We discuss the underlying notion of rank, and the associated
reduction proposed independently by Scott and Suszko. As acknowledged by Suszko, that reduction
fails to preserve compositionality in general. We propose a modification of that notion of reduction,
allowing us to prove that over compact logics with what we call regular connectives, rank results
are maintained even if we request the preservation of truth-compositionality and additional semantic
properties.
