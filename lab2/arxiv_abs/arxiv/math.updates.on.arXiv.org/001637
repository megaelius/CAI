This paper considers a two-hop network architecture known as a combination network, where a layer
of relay nodes connects a server to a set of end users. In particular, a new model is investigated where
the intermediate relays employ caches in addition to the end users. First, a new centralized coded
caching scheme is developed that utilizes maximum distance separable (MDS) coding, jointly optimizes
cache placement and delivery phase, and enables decomposing the combination network into a set
virtual multicast sub-networks. It is shown that if the sum of the memory of an end user and its connected
relay nodes is sufficient to store the database, then the server can disengage in the delivery phase
and all the end users' requests can be satisfied by the caches in the network. Lower bounds on the normalized
delivery load using genie-aided cut-set arguments are presented along with second hop optimality.
Next recognizing the information security concerns of coded caching, this new model is studied
under three different secrecy settings: 1) secure delivery where we require an external entity
must not gain any information about the database files by observing the transmitted signals over
the network links, 2) secure caching, where we impose the constraint that end users must not be able
to obtain any information about files that they did not request, and 3) both secure delivery and secure
caching, simultaneously. We demonstrate how network topology affects the system performance
under these secrecy requirements. Finally, we provide numerical results demonstrating the system
performance in each of the settings considered.
