This paper continues the examination of inventory control in which the inventory is modelled by
a diffusion process and a long-term average cost criterion is used to make decisions. The class of
such models under consideration have general drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points
that are consistent with the notion that demand should tend to reduce the inventory level. The conditions
on the cost functions are greatly relaxed from those in \cite{helm:15b}. Characterization of the
cost of a general $(s,S)$ policy as a function of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear optimization
problem over the ordering levels $s$ and $S$. Existence of an optimizing pair $(s_*,S_*)$ is established
for these models under very weak conditions; non-existence of an optimizing pair is also discussed.
Using average expected occupation and ordering measures and weak convergence arguments, weak
conditions are given for the optimality of the $(s_*,S_*)$ ordering policy in the general class
of admissible policies. The analysis involves an auxiliary function that is globally $C^2$ and
which, together with the infimal cost, solve a particular system of linear equations and inequalities
related to but different from the long-term average Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This approach
provides an analytical solution to the problem rather than a solution involving intricate analysis
of the stochastic processes. The range of applicability of these results is illustrated on a drifted
Brownian motion inventory model, both unconstrained and reflected, and on a geometric Brownian
motion inventory model under three different cost structures.
