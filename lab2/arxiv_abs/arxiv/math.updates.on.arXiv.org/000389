In a wide range of quantum theoretical settings -- from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory,
from gauge theory to string theory -- singularities in the complex Borel plane, usually associated
to instantons or renormalons, render perturbation theory ill-defined as they give rise to nonperturbative
ambiguities. These ambiguities are associated to choices of an integration contour in the resummation
of perturbation theory, along (singular) Stokes directions in the complex Borel plane (rendering
perturbative expansions non-Borel summable along any Stokes line). More recently, it has been
shown that the proper framework to address these issues is that of resurgent analysis and transseries.
In this context, the cancelation of all nonperturbative ambiguities is shown to be a consequence
of choosing the transseries median resummation as the appropriate family of unambiguous real solutions
along the coupling-constant real axis. While the median resummation is easily implemented for
one-parameter transseries, once one considers more general multi-parameter transseries the
procedure becomes highly dependent upon properly understanding Stokes transitions in the complex
Borel plane. In particular, all Stokes coefficients must now be known in order to explicitly implement
multi-parameter median resummations. In the cases where quantum-theoretical physical observables
are described by resurgent functions and transseries, the methods described herein show how one
may cancel nonperturbative ambiguities, and define these observables nonperturbatively starting
out from perturbation theory. Along the way, structural results concerning resurgent transseries
are also obtained.
