We derive a theory for material surfaces that maximally inhibit the diffusive transport of a dynamically
active vector field, such as the linear momentum, the angular momentum or the vorticity, in general
fluid flows. These special material surfaces (\emph{Lagrangian active barriers}) provide physics-based,
observer-independent boundaries of dynamically active coherent structures. We find that Lagrangian
active barriers evolve from invariant surfaces of an associated steady and incompressible \emph{barrier
equation}, whose right-hand side is the time-averaged pullback of the viscous stress terms in the
evolution equation for the dynamically active vector field. Instantaneous limits of these barriers
mark objective \emph{Eulerian active barriers} to the short-term diffusive transport of the dynamically
active vector field. We obtain that in unsteady Beltrami flows, Lagrangian and Eulerian active
barriers coincide exactly with purely advective transport barriers bounding observed coherent
structures. In more general flows, active barriers can be identified by applying Lagrangian coherent
structure (LCS) diagnostics, such as the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and the polar rotation
angle, to the appropriate active barrier equation. In comparison to their passive counterparts,
these \emph{active LCS diagnostics} require no significant fluid particle separation and hence
provide substantially higher-resolved Lagrangian and Eulerian coherent structure boundaries
from temporally shorter velocity data sets. We illustrate these results and their physical interpretation
on two-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence and on a three-dimensional turbulent
channel flow.
