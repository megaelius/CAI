We consider the FCFS G/G/n queue in the Halfin-Whitt regime, in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions
(i.e. infinite variance). We prove that under minimal assumptions, i.e. only that processing times
have finite 1 + epsilon moment and inter-arrival times have finite second moment, the sequence of
stationary queue length distributions, normalized by $n^{\frac{1}{2}}$, is tight. All previous
tightness results for the stationary queue length required that processing times have finite 2
+ epsilon moment. Furthermore, we develop simple and explicit bounds on the stationary queue length
in that setting. When processing times have an asymptotically Pareto tail with index alpha in (1,2),
we bound the large deviations behavior of the limiting process, and derive a matching lower bound
when inter-arrival times are Markovian. Interestingly, we find that the large deviations behavior
of the limit has a sub-exponential decay, differing fundamentally from the exponentially decaying
tails known to hold in the light-tailed setting, and answering an open question of Gamarnik and Goldberg.
For the setting where instead the inter-arrival times have an asymptotically Pareto tail with index
alpha in (1,2), we extend recent results of Hurvich and Reed (who analyzed the case of deterministic
processing times) by proving that for general processing time distributions, the sequence of stationary
queue length distributions, normalized by $n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$, is tight (here we use the scaling
of Hurvich and Reed, i.e. Halfin-Whitt-Reed regime). We are again able to bound the large-deviations
behavior of the limit, and find that our derived bounds do not depend on the particular processing
time distribution, and are in fact tight even for the case of deterministic processing times.
