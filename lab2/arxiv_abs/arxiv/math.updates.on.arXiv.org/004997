Given devices space $D$, an intensity measure $\lambda\in(0,\infty)$, transition kernel from
the positive reals to the space $D,$ a path -loss function which depends on some positive constant
$\alpha,$ and some technical constants $\tau_{\lambda},\gamma_{\lambda}:(0,\,\infty)\to
(0,\infty)$ we define a Marked Poisson Point Process(MPPP) and, a Signal-to- Interference and
Noise Ratio (SINR) graph model. For the SINR graph model we define the \emph{empirical marked measure}
and the \emph{empirical connectivity measure}. For a class of SINR graphs model, we prove joint
Large Deviation Principle(LDP) for the empirical marked measure and the empirical connectivity
measure with speed $\lambda$ in the $\tau$-topology. In particular if $D=\R^{d-2}\times[-T,\,T]^2,$
for $T>0,$ we obtain a much explicit expression for the rate function. From the joint large deviation
principle we obtain an Asymptotic Equipartition Property(AEP) for network structured data modelled
as an SINR graph. In particular if $D=\R^{d-2}\times[-T,\,T]^2,$ for $T>0,$ we obtain a explicit
function. We also prove a Local Large Deviation Principle(LLDP) for the class of SINR graphs on $D=\R^{d-2}\times[-T,\,T]^2,$
with speed $\lambda$ from \emph{ spectral potential} point. Given, an empirical marked measure
$\omega$, we define the so-called spectral potential $U_{R_{T,d}}(\omega,\,\cdot),$ for the
SINR graph process, where $R_{T,d}$ is a properly defined constant function which depends on the
device locations and the marks. We show that the \emph{Kullback action} or the \emph{ divergence
function} $I_{\omega}(\pi),$ with respect to the empirical connectivity measure $\pi,$ is the
legendre dual of the spectral potential.
