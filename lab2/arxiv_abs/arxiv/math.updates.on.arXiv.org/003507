We study new classes of convex bodies and star bodies with unusual properties. First we define the
class of reciprocal bodies, which may be viewed as convex bodies of the form "$1/K$". The map $K\mapsto
K^\prime$ sending a body to its reciprocal is a duality on the class of reciprocal bodies, and we study
its properties. To connect this new map with the classic polarity we use another construction, associating
to each convex body $K$ a star body which we call its flower and denote by $K^\clubsuit$. The mapping
$K\mapsto K^\clubsuit$ is a bijection between the class $\mathcal{K}_0^n$ of convex bodies and
the class $\mathcal{F}^n$ of flowers. We show that the polarity map $\circ:\mathcal{K}_0^n\to\mathcal{K}_0^n$
decomposes into two separate bijections: First our flower map $\clubsuit:\mathcal{K}_0^n\to\mathcal{F}^n$,
followed by the spherical inversion $\Phi$ which maps $\mathcal{F}^n$ back to $\mathcal{K}_0^n$.
Each of these maps has its own properties, which combine to create the various properties of the polarity
map. We study the various relations between the four maps $\prime$, $\circ$, $\clubsuit$ and $\Phi$
and use these relations to derive some of their properties. For example, we show that a convex body
$K$ is a reciprocal body if and only if its flower $K^\clubsuit$ is convex. We show that the class $\mathcal{F}^n$
has a very rich structure, and is closed under many operations, including the Minkowski addition.
This structure has corollaries for the other maps which we study. For example, we show that if $K$
and $T$ are reciprocal bodies so is their "harmonic sum" $(K^\circ+T^\circ)^\circ$. We also show
that the volume $\left|\left(\sum_i\lambda_{i}K_i\right)^\clubsuit\right|$ is a homogeneous
polynomial in the $\lambda_i$'s, whose coefficients can be called "$\clubsuit$-type mixed volumes".
