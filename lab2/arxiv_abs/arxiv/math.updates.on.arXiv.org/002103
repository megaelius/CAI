In this work we develop a new criterion for the existence of topological horseshoes for surface homeomorphisms
in the isotopy class of the identity. Based on our previous work on forcing theory, this new criterion
is purely topological and can be expressed in terms of equivariant Brouwer foliations and transverse
trajectories. We then apply this new tool in the study of the dynamics of homeomorphisms of surfaces
with zero genus and null topological entropy and we obtain several applications. For homeomorphisms
of the open annulus $\mathbb{A}$ with zero topological entropy, we show that rotation numbers exists
for all points with nonempty omega limits, and that if $\mathbb{A}$ is a generalized region of instability
then it admits a single rotation vector. We also offer a new proof of a recent result of Passegi, Potrie
and Sambarino, showing that zero entropy dissipative homeomorphisms of the annulus having as an
atractor a circloid have a single rotation number. Our work also studies homeomorphisms of the sphere
without horseshoes. For these maps we present a structure theorem in terms of fixed point free invariant
sub-annuli, as well as a very restricted description of all possible dynamical behavior in the transitive
subsets. This description ensures, for instance, that transitive sets can contain at most $2$ distinct
periodic orbits and that, in many cases, the restriction of the homeomorphism to the transitive
set must be an extension of an odometer. In particular, we show that any nontrivial and stable transitive
subset of a dissipative diffeomorphism of the plane is always infinitely renormalizable in the
sense of Bonatti-Gambaudo-Lion-Tresser.
