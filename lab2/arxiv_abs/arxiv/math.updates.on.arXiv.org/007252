We consider two manifestations of non-positive curvature: acylindrical actions on hyperbolic
spaces and quasigeodesic stability. We study these properties for the class of hierarchically
hyperbolic groups, which is a general framework for studying many important families of groups,
including mapping class groups, right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups, most 3-manifold groups,
and many others. A group that admits an acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space may admit many such
actions on different hyperbolic spaces, so it is natural to search for a "best" one. The set of all
cobounded acylindrical actions on hyperbolic spaces admits a natural poset structure; in this
paper we prove that all hierarchically hyperbolic groups admit a unique action which is the largest
in this poset. The action we construct is also universal in the sense that every element which acts
loxodromically in some acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space does so in this one. Special cases
of this result are themselves new and interesting. For instance, this is the first proof that right-angled
Coxeter groups admit universal acylindrical actions. The notion of quasigeodesic stability of
subgroups provides a natural analogue of quasiconvexity outside the context of hyperbolic groups.
We provide a complete classification of stable subgroups of hierarchically hyperbolic groups,
generalizing and extending results that are known for mapping class groups and right-angled Artin
groups. We also provide a characterization of contracting quasigeodesics; interestingly, in
this generality the proof is much simpler than in the special cases where it was already known. In
the appendix, it is verified that any space satisfying the a priori weaker property of being an "almost
hierarchically hyperbolic space" is actually a hierarchically hyperbolic space. The results
of the appendix are used to streamline the proofs in the main text.
