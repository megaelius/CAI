We derive conditions for monotonicity properties that characterize general flows of a commodity
over a network, where the flow is described by potential and flow dynamics on the edges, as well as
potential continuity and Kirchhoff-Neumann mass balance requirements at nodes. The transported
commodity may be injected or withdrawn at any of the network nodes, and its movement throughout the
network is controlled by nodal actuators. For a class of dissipative nonlinear parabolic partial
differential equation (PDE) systems on networks, we derive conditions for monotonicity properties
in steady-state flow, as well as for propagation of monotone ordering of states with respect to time-varying
boundary condition parameters. In the latter case, initial conditions, as well as time-varying
parameters in the coupling conditions at vertices, provide an initial boundary value problem (IBVP).
We prove that ordering properties of the solution to the IBVP are preserved when the initial conditions
and the parameters of the time-varying coupling law are appropriately ordered. Then, we prove that
when monotone ordering is not preserved, the first crossing of solutions occurs at a network node.
We consider the implications for robust optimization and optimal control formulations and real-time
monitoring of uncertain dynamic flows on networks, and discuss application to subsonic compressible
fluid flow with energy dissipation on physical networks. The main result and monitoring policy
are demonstrated for gas pipeline test networks and a case study using data corresponding to a real
working system. We propose applications of this general result to the control and monitoring of
natural gas transmission networks.
