One of the key enablers of future wireless communications is constituted by massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which can improve the spectral efficiency by orders of magnitude.
However, in existing massive MIMO systems, conventional phased arrays are used for beamforming,
which result in excessive power consumption and hardware cost. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient
and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of
passive elements. In this paper, we propose and develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS having
256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an
electromagnetic surface, where positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize
2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. Based on this radical design, the world's first wireless
communication prototype using RIS having 256 2-bit elements is designed and developed. Specifically,
the prototype conceived consists of modular hardware and flexible software, including the hosts
for parameter setting and data exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for
baseband and radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal transmission
and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility and efficiency of RISs in future
wireless communications. More particularly, it is shown that a 21.7 dBi antenna gain can be obtained
by the proposed RIS at 2.3 GHz, while at the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, i.e., 28.5 GHz, a
19.1 dBi antenna gain can be achieved. Furthermore, the over-the-air (OTA) test results show that
the RIS-based wireless communication prototype developed is capable of significantly reducing
the power consumption.
