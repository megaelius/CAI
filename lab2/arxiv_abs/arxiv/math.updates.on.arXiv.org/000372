It was recently proved that embedded solutions of Euclidean hypersurface flows with speeds given
by concave (convex), degree one homogeneous functions of the Weingarten map are interior (exterior)
non-collapsing. These results were subsequently extended to hypersurface flows in the sphere
and hyperbolic space. In the first part of the paper, we show that locally convex solutions are exterior
non-collapsing for a larger class of speed functions than previously considered; more precisely,
we show that the previous results hold when convexity of the speed function is relaxed to inverse-concavity.
We note that inverse-concavity is satisfied by a large class of concave speed functions. As a consequence,
we obtain a large class of two-sided non-collapsing flows, whereas previously two-sided non-collapsing
was only known for the mean curvature flow. In the second part of the paper, we demonstrate the utility
of two sided non-collapsing with a straightforward proof of convergence of compact, convex hypersurfaces
to round points. The proof of the non-collapsing estimate is similar to the previous results mentioned,
in that we show that the exterior ball curvature is a viscosity supersolution of the linearised flow.
The new ingredient is the following observation: Since the function which provides an upper support
in the derivation of the viscosity inequality is defined on $M\times M$ (or $TM$ in the `boundary
case'), whereas the exterior ball curvature and the linearised flow equation depend only on the
first factor, we are privileged with a freedom of choice in which second derivatives from the extra
directions to include in the calculation. The optimal choice is closely related to the class of inverse-concave
speed functions.
