Kings, Lei, Loeffler and Zerbes constructed a three-variable Euler system $\kappa({\bf g},{\bf
h})$ of Beilinson-Flach elements associated to a pair of Hida families $({\bf g},{\bf h})$ and exploited
it to obtain applications to the arithmetic of elliptic curves by specializing the Euler system
to points of weights $(2,1,1)$. The aim of this article is showing that this Euler system also encodes
arithmetic information at points of weights $(1,1,0)$, concerning the group of units of the associated
number fields. The setting becomes specially novel and intriguing when ${\bf g}$ and ${\bf h}$ specialize
in weight $1$ to $p$-stabilizations of eigenforms such that one is dual of another. We encounter
an exceptional zero phenomenon which forces the specialization of $\kappa({\bf g}, {\bf h})$ at
$(1,1,0)$ to vanish and we are led to study the derivative of this class. The main result we obtain
is the proof of a conjecture of Darmon, Lauder and Rotger on iterated integrals and another conjecture
of Darmon and Rotger for Beilinson-Flach elements in the adjoint setting. The main point of this
paper is that the methods of previous works, where the above conjectures are proved when the weight
$1$ eigenforms have CM, do not apply to our setting and new ideas are required. Here, a factorization
of $p$-adic $L$-functions is not available due to the lack of critical points. Instead we resort
to the principle of improved Euler systems and $p$-adic $L$-functions to reduce our problems to
questions which can be resolved using Galois deformation theory. We expect this approach may be
adapted to prove other cases of the elliptic Stark conjecture and of its generalizations that are
appearing in the literature.
