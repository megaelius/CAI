A 1-qubit gate is defined as an element of the unitary group $U(2)$. The problem of finding good approximations
of arbitrary 1-qubit gates is identical to that of finding a dense group generated by a universal
subset of $PSU(2)$ to approximate an arbitrary element of $U(2)$. Notably, this problem has been
recently studied by Sarnak in [8]. We will work with a universal gate set $T$, a subset of $SU(2)$ such
that the group generated by the elements of $T$ is dense in $SU(2)$. For an arbitrary $\varepsilon
> 0$, we define $t_{\varepsilon}$ as the minimum reduced word length such that every point of $SU(2)$
lies within a ball of radius $\varepsilon$ centered at the points in the dense subgroup generated
by $T$. We define a measure of efficiency on $T$, denoted $K(T)$, construct a $t_{\varepsilon}'$
such that most points in $PSU(2)$ have optimally efficient approximation and we conjecture that
$\varepsilon \leq f(t_{\varepsilon})5^{-t_{\varepsilon}/4}$ for a function $f:(0,\infty)\to
(1,\infty)$ satisfying: \begin{equation*} \lim_{ t_{\varepsilon} \to \infty} log(f(t_{\varepsilon}))/t_{\varepsilon}
\end{equation*} exists with value $0$. Our conjecture can be formulated to mean the following:
Let $\nu(5^{t_{\varepsilon}})$ denote the set of integer solutions of the quadratic form: $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2=5^{t_{\varepsilon}}$.
Let $M\equiv M_{S^3}(\mathcal{N})$ denote the covering radius of the points $\mathcal{N}=\nu(5^{t_{\varepsilon}})\cup\nu(5^{t_{\varepsilon}-1})$
on the sphere $S^{3}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. Then $M \sim f(\log N)N^{-1/4}$. Here $N\equiv N(\varepsilon)=6\cdot5^{t_{\varepsilon}}-2$.
This is a weaker conjecture than that proposed in [2], namely: $M\geq N^{{-1/4}+o(1)}$. We prove
that this conjecture implies that $K(T)=\dfrac{4}{3}$. This answers a question of Sarnak in [8].
