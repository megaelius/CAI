Cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics are widely used in the change point inference and identification.
This paper studies two problems for high-dimensional mean vectors based on the $\ell^{\infty}$-norm
of the CUSUM statistics when dimension $p$ can be larger than sample size $n$. For the problem of testing
for the existence of a change point in an independent sample generated from the mean-shift model,
we introduce a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap to calibrate critical values of the CUSUM test statistics
in high dimensions. The proposed bootstrap CUSUM test is fully data-dependent and it has strong
theoretical guarantees under arbitrary dependence structures and mild moment conditions. Specifically,
with a boundary removal parameter the proposed test enjoys the uniform validity in size under the
null and achieves the minimax separation rate under the sparse alternatives. Once a change point
is detected, we estimate the change point location by maximizing the $\ell^{\infty}$-norm of the
generalized CUSUM statistics at two different weighting scales. The first estimator is based on
the covariance stationary CUSUM statistics. The second one is based on non-stationary CUSUM statistics,
assigning less weights on the boundary data points. We prove their consistency in nearly parametric
rate $n^{-1/2}$ and $n^{-1}$ (the best possible rate), respectively. In both cases, $p$ impacts
convergence rate only through the logarithm factors. In the presence of multiple change points,
we propose a principled bootstrap-assisted binary segmentation algorithm to dynamically adjust
the change point detection rule and recursively estimate their locations. We derive its rate of
convergence under suitable signal separation and strength conditions. The results derived are
non-asymptotic and we provide extensive simulation studies. The empirical evidence shows an encouraging
agreement with theoretical results.
