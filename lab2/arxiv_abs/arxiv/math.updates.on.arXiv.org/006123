As well known, harmonic functions satisfy the mean value property, namely the average of the function
over a ball is equal to its value at the center. This fact naturally raises the question on whether
this is a characterizing feature of balls, namely whether a set for which all harmonic functions
satisfy the mean value property is necessarily a ball. This question was investigated by several
authors, and was finally elegantly, completely and positively settled by \"Ulk\"u Kuran, with
an artful use of elementary techniques. This classical problem has been recently fleshed out by
Giovanni Cupini, Nicola Fusco, Ermanno Lanconelli and Xiao Zhong who proved a quantitative stability
result for the mean value formula, showing that a suitable "mean value gap" (measuring the normalized
difference between the average of harmonic functions on a given set and their pointwise value) is
bounded from below by the Lebesgue measure of the "gap" between the set and the ball (and, consequently,
by the Fraenkel asymmetry of the set). That is, if a domain "almost" satisfies the mean value property,
then it must be necessarily close to a ball. Here we investigate the nonlocal counterparts of these
results. In particular we will prove a classification result and a stability result, establishing
that: if fractional harmonic functions enjoy a suitable exterior average property for a given domain,
then the domain is necessarily a ball, a suitable "nonlocal mean value gap" is bounded from below
by an appropriate measure of the difference between the set and the ball. Differently from the classical
case, some of our arguments rely on purely nonlocal properties, with no classical counterpart,
such as the fact that "all functions are locally fractional harmonic up to a small error".
