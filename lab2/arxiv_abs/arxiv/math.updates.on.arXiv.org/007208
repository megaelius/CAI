The past decade has seen a flourishing of advances in harmonic analysis of graphs. They lie at the
crossroads of graph theory and such analytical tools as graph Laplacians, Markov processes and
associated boundaries, analysis of path-space, harmonic analysis, dynamics, and tail-invariant
measures. Motivated by recent advances for the special case of Bratteli diagrams, our present focus
will be on those graph systems $G$ with the property that the sets of vertices $V$ and edges $E$ admit
discrete level structures. A choice of discrete levels in turn leads to new and intriguing discrete-time
random-walk models. Our main extension (which greatly expands the earlier analysis of Bratteli
diagrams) is the case when the levels in the graph system $G$ under consideration are now allowed
to be standard measure spaces. Hence, in the measure framework, we must deal with systems of transition
probabilities, as opposed to incidence matrices (for the traditional Bratteli diagrams). The
paper is divided into two parts, (i) the special case when the levels are countable discrete systems,
and (ii) the (non-atomic) measurable category, i.e., when each level is a prescribed measure space
with standard Borel structure. The study of the two cases together is motivated in part by recent
new results on graph-limits. Our results depend on a new analysis of certain duality systems for
operators in Hilbert space; specifically, one dual system of operator for each level. We prove new
results in both cases, (i) and (ii); and we further stress both similarities, and differences, between
results and techniques involved in the two cases.
