Kingman (1978)'s representation theorem states that any exchangeable partition of $\mathbb{N}$
can be represented as a paintbox based on a random mass-partition. Similarly, any exchangeable
composition (i.e.\ ordered partition of $\mathbb{N}$) can be represented as a paintbox based on
an interval-partition (Gnedin 1997). Our first main result is that any exchangeable coalescent
process (not necessarily Markovian) can be represented as a paintbox based on a random non-decreasing
process valued in interval-partitions, called nested interval-partition, generalizing the
notion of comb metric space introduced by Lambert \& Uribe Bravo (2017) to represent compact ultrametric
spaces. As a special case, we show that any $\Lambda$-coalescent can be obtained from a paintbox
based on a unique random nested interval partition called $\Lambda$-comb, which is Markovian with
explicit semi-group. This nested interval-partition directly relates to the flow of bridges of
Bertoin \& Le~Gall (2003). We also display a particularly simple description of the so-called evolving
coalescent (Pfaffelhuber \& Wakolbinger 2006) by a comb-valued Markov process. Next, we prove
that any measured ultrametric space $U$, under mild measure-theoretic assumptions on $U$, is the
leaf set of a tree composed of a separable subtree called the backbone, on which are grafted additional
subtrees, which act as star-trees from the standpoint of sampling. Displaying this so-called weak
isometry requires us to extend the Gromov-weak topology of Greven et al (2006), that was initially
designed for separable metric spaces, to non-separable ultrametric spaces. It allows us to show
that for any such ultrametric space $U$, there is a nested interval-partition which is 1) indistinguishable
from $U$ in the Gromov-weak topology; 2) weakly isometric to $U$ if $U$ has complete backbone; 3)
isometric to $U$ if $U$ is complete and separable.
