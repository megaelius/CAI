Sequential estimation of a vector of signal amplitudes in a linear signal model is considered. It
is known that finding the optimal sequential estimator is an intractable problem with a general
stopping time that is adapted to the complete observation history \cite{Ghosh87}. By properly
restricting the search space to stopping times that are adapted to a specific subset of the complete
observation history we derive the optimal sequential estimator under two different formulations
of the problem. In the first formulation, the (unconditional) covariance of the estimator is used
to assess its accuracy, as a common practice. In the second formulation, the conditional covariance
is used for the same purpose, which is preferred over the former when there is an auxiliary statistic
whose distribution does not depend on the parameters to be estimated \cite{Efron78}. Our analytical
results show that the optimal stopping rule in the conditional formulation is a simple one-dimensional
threshold rule for any number of parameters to be estimated. On the other hand, the optimal stopping
rule in the unconditional formulation for $n$ parameters is characterized by a hypersurface in
a $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$-dimensional space, which is found by numerically computing an $n$-dimensional
integral. Hence, finding the optimal sequential estimator under the traditional unconditional
formulation is not tractable even for a small number of parameters. However, under the conditional
formulation the optimal sequential estimator has the same simple form for any number of parameters,
allowing for decentralized implementations. We further consider the decentralized version of
the conditional problem in a wireless sensor network where each sensor can only send a brief summary
of its observations to a fusion center (FC) due to strict bandwidth and energy constraints.
