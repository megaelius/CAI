The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is unfolding as a major international crisis whose
influence extends to every aspect of our daily lives. Effective testing allows infected individuals
to be quarantined, thus reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to
restart the economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be greatly aided
by contact tracing that provides health care providers information about the whereabouts of infected
patients in order to determine whom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling
the virus typically use a ``test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing individuals
with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via a combinations of patient
memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing their contacts, and repeating this procedure.
The problem is that such strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources.
This is especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days after the infection
(or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread
the virus). Such greedy strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and
flare up in the future. In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential learning-based
resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to the problem is provided by a time-varying
social contact graph obtained through various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient
learning strategies that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based
on policy iteration and look-ahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance bounds, and
ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as well as in the tests themselves.
