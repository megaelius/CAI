Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used in the mathematical modeling
of natural phenomena and man made complex systems. In particular, parabolic PDEs are a fundamental
tool to determine fair prices of financial derivatives in the financial industry. The PDEs appearing
in financial engineering applications are often nonlinear and high dimensional since the dimension
typically corresponds to the number of considered financial assets. A major issue is that most approximation
methods for nonlinear PDEs in the literature suffer under the so-called curse of dimensionality
in the sense that the computational effort to compute an approximation with a prescribed accuracy
grows exponentially in the dimension of the PDE or in the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation
accuracy and nearly all approximation methods have not been shown not to suffer under the curse of
dimensionality. Recently, a new class of approximation schemes for semilinear parabolic PDEs,
termed full history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP) algorithms, were introduced and it was proven
that MLP algorithms do overcome the curse of dimensionality for semilinear heat equations. In this
paper we extend those findings to a more general class of semilinear PDEs including as special cases
semilinear Black-Scholes equations used for the pricing of financial derivatives with default
risks. More specifically, we introduce an MLP algorithm for the approximation of solutions of semilinear
Black-Scholes equations and prove that the computational effort of our method grows at most polynomially
both in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy. This is, to the
best of our knowledge, the first result showing that the approximation of solutions of semilinear
Black-Scholes equations is a polynomially tractable approximation problem.
