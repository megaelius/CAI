Nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws admit singular solutions such as shockwaves (discontinuities
in conserved variables), rarefaction waves (discontinuities in derivatives), and vacuum states
(loss of strong hyperbolicity). When ostensibly high-order numerical methods are applied in such
solution regimes, unphysical oscillations present themselves that can lead to large errors and
a breakdown of the numerical simulation. In this work we develop a new Lax-Wendroff discontinuous
Galerkin (LxW-DG) method with a limiting strategy that keeps the solution non-oscillatory and
positivity-preserving for relevant variables, such as height in the shallow water equations and
density and pressure in the compressible Euler equations. The proposed LxW-DG scheme updates the
solution over each time-step with a locally-implicit predictor followed by an explicit corrector.
The locally-implicit prediction phase is formulated in terms of primitive variables, which greatly
simplifies the solver. The resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are approximately
solved via a Picard iteration, where the number of iterations is equal to the order of accuracy of
the method. The correction phase is an explicit evaluation formulated in terms of conservative
variables in order to guarantee numerical conservation. In order to achieve full positivity-preservation,
limiting is required in both the prediction and correction steps. The resulting scheme is applied
to several standard test cases for the shallow water and compressible Euler equations. All of the
presented examples are written in a freely available open-source Python code.
