It has been well acknowledged that buildings account for a large proportion of the world's energy
consumption. However, the energy use of buildings, especially the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
(HVAC), is far from being efficient. There still exists a dramatic potential to save energy through
improving building energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper studies the control of HVAC system
for multi-zone buildings with the objective to reduce energy consumption cost while satisfying
thermal comfort. In particular, the thermal couplings due to the heat transfer between the adjacent
zones are incorporated in the optimization. Considering that a centralized method is generally
computationally prohibitive for large buildings, an efficient decentralized approach is developed,
based on the Accelerated Distributed Augmented Lagrangian (ADAL) method [1]. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed method, we first compare it with a centralized method, in which the optimal solution
of a small-scale problem can be obtained. We find that this decentralized approach can almost approach
the optimal solution of the problem. Further, this decentralized approach is compared with the
Distributed Token-Based Scheduling Strategy (DTBSS) [2]. The numeric results reveal that when
the number of zones is relatively small (less than 20), the two decentralized methods can achieve
a comparable performance regarding the cost of the HVAC system. However, with an increase of the
number of zones in the building, the proposed decentralized approach demonstrates better performance
with a considerable reduction of the total cost. Moreover, the decentralized approach proposed
in this paper demonstrate better scalability with less average computation required.
