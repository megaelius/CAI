Consider the problem of choosing a set of actions to optimize an objective function that is a real-valued
polymatroid function subject to matroid constraints. The greedy strategy provides an approximate
solution to the optimization problem, and it is known to satisfy some performance bounds in terms
of the total curvature. The total curvature depends on the value of objective function on sets outside
the constraint matroid. If we are given a function defined only on the matroid, the problem still
makes sense, but the existing bounds involving the total curvature do not apply. This is puzzling:
If the optimization problem is perfectly well defined, why should the bounds no longer apply? This
motivates an alternative formulation of such bounding techniques. The first question that comes
to mind is whether it is possible to extend a polymatroid function defined on a matroid to one on the
entire power set. This was recently shown to be negative in general. Here, we provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of an \emph{incremental} extension of a polymatroid function
defined on the uniform matroid of rank $k$ to one defined on the uniform matroid of rank $k+1$, together
with an algorithm for constructing the extension. Whenever a polymatroid objective function defined
on a matroid can be extended to the entire power set, the greedy approximation bounds involving the
total curvature of the extension apply. However, these bounds still depend on sets outside the constraint
matroid. Motivated by this, we define a new notion of curvature called \emph{partial curvature},
involving only sets in the matroid. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an extension
of the function to have a total curvature that is equal to the partial curvature. Moreover, we prove
that the bounds in terms of the partial curvature are in general improved over the previous ones......
