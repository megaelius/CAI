This paper presents a multilevel convergence framework for multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT)
as a generalization of previous two-grid estimates. The framework provides a priori upper bounds
on the convergence of MGRIT V- and F-cycles, with different relaxation schemes, by deriving the
respective residual and error propagation operators. The residual and error operators are functions
of the time stepping operator, analyzed directly and bounded in norm, both numerically and analytically.
We present various upper bounds of different computational cost and varying sharpness. These upper
bounds are complemented by proposing analytic formulae for the approximate convergence factor
of V-cycle algorithms that take the number of fine grid time points, the temporal coarsening factors,
and the eigenvalues of the time stepping operator as parameters. The paper concludes with supporting
numerical investigations of parabolic (anisotropic diffusion) and hyperbolic (wave equation)
model problems. We assess the sharpness of the bounds and the quality of the approximate convergence
factors. Observations from these numerical investigations demonstrate the value of the proposed
multilevel convergence framework for estimating MGRIT convergence a priori and for the design
of a convergent algorithm. We further highlight that observations in the literature are captured
by the theory, including that two-level Parareal and multilevel MGRIT with F-relaxation do not
yield scalable algorithms and the benefit of a stronger relaxation scheme. An important observation
is that with increasing numbers of levels MGRIT convergence deteriorates for the hyperbolic model
problem, while constant convergence factors can be achieved for the diffusion equation. The theory
also indicates that L-stable Runge-Kutta schemes are more amendable to multilevel parallel-in-time
integration with MGRIT than A-stable Runge-Kutta schemes.
