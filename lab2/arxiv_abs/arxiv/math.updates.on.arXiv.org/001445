Fix a commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$, an element $\beta\in \mathbf{k}$ and an integer $n>0$. Let
$\mathcal{X}$ be the polynomial ring over $\mathbf{k}$ in the $n(n-1)/2$ indeterminates $x_{i,j}$
for all $1\leq i<j\leq n$. Consider the ideal $\mathcal{J}_\beta$ of $\mathcal{X}$ generated
by all polynomials of the form $x_{i,j} x_{j,k} - x_{i,k} (x_{i,j}+x_{j,k}+\beta)$ for $1\leq
i<j<k\leq n$. The quotient algebra $\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{J}_\beta$ (at least for a certain universal
choice of $\mathbf{k}$ and $\beta$) has been introduced by Karola M\'esz\'aros as the abelianization
of Anatol Kirillov's quasi-classical Yang-Baxter algebra. A natural question is to find a combinatorial
basis of this quotient algebra. One can define the "pathless monomials", i.e., the monomials in
$\mathcal{X}$ that have no divisors of the form $x_{i,j}x_{j,k}$ with $1\leq i<j<k\leq n$. The
residue classes of these pathless monomials indeed span the $\mathbf{k}$-module $\mathcal{X}/\mathcal{J}_\beta$,
but do not form a basis. More recently, the study of Grothendieck polynomials has led Laura Escobar
and Karola M\'esz\'aros to defining a $\mathbf{k}$-algebra homomorphism $D$ from $\mathcal{X}$
into the polynomial ring $\mathbf{k} [ t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_{n-1} ]$ that sends each $x_{i,j}$ to
$t_i$. We prove a result which they conjectured (and partly proved): If $p\in \mathcal{X}$, and
if $q\in \mathcal{X}$ is a $\mathbf{k}$-linear combination of pathless monomials satisfying
$p \equiv q \mod \mathcal{J}_\beta$, then $D(q)$ does not depend on $q$ (as long as $\beta$ and $p$
are fixed). We also find an actual basis of the $\mathbf{k}$-module $\mathcal{X} / \mathcal{J}_\beta$,
using what we call "forkless monomials". We furthermore formulate a generalization, which will
be proved in the next version of this preprint.
