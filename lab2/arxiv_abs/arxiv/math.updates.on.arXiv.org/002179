The hard-core model has attracted much attention across several disciplines, representing lattice
gases in statistical physics and independent sets in discrete mathematics and computer science.
On finite graphs, we are given a parameter $\lambda$, and an independent set $I$ arises with probability
proportional to $\lambda^{|I|}$. On infinite graphs a Gibbs measure is defined as a suitable limit
with the correct conditional probabilities, and we are interested in determining when this limit
is unique and when there is phase coexistence, i.e., existence of multiple Gibbs measures. It has
long been conjectured that on ${\mathbb Z}^2$ this model has a critical value $\lambda_c \approx
3.796$ with the property that if $\lambda < \lambda_c$ then it exhibits uniqueness of phase, while
if $\lambda > \lambda_c$ then there is phase coexistence. Much of the work to date on this problem
has focused on the regime of uniqueness, with the state of the art being recent work of Sinclair, Srivastava,
\v{S}tefankovi\v{c} and Yin showing that there is a unique Gibbs measure for all $\lambda < 2.538$.
Here we give the first non-trivial result in the other direction, showing that there are multiple
Gibbs measures for all $\lambda > 5.3506$. There is some potential for lowering this bound, but with
the methods we are using we cannot hope to replace $5.3506$ with anything below about $4.8771$. Our
proof begins along the lines of the standard Peierls argument, but we add two innovations. First,
following ideas of Koteck\'y and Randall, we construct an event that distinguishes two boundary
conditions and always has long contours associated with it, obviating the need to accurately enumerate
short contours. Second, we obtain improved bounds on the number of contours by relating them to a
new class of self-avoiding walks on an oriented version of ${\mathbb Z}^2$.
