We derive new, localized geometric integral identities for solutions to the $3D$ compressible
Euler equations under an arbitrary equation of state when the sound speed is positive. The identities
are coercive in the first derivatives of the specific vorticity and the second derivatives of the
entropy, and the error terms exhibit remarkable regularity and null structures. Our framework
allows one to simultaneously unleash the full power of the geometric vectorfield method for both
the wave- and transport- parts of the flow on compact regions. In particular, the integral identities
yield localized control over one additional derivative of the vorticity and entropy compared to
standard results, assuming that the initial data enjoy the same gain. Similar results hold for the
solution's higher derivatives. We derive the identities in detail for two classes of spacetime
regions that frequently arise in PDE applications: i) compact spacetime regions that are globally
hyperbolic with respect to the acoustical metric and ii) compact regions covered by double-acoustically
null foliations. Our results have implications for the geometry and regularity of solutions, the
formation of shocks, the structure of the maximal classical development of the data, and for controlling
solutions whose state along a pair of intersecting characteristic hypersurfaces is known. Our
analysis relies on a recent new formulation of the compressible Euler equations that splits the
flow into a geometric wave-part coupled to a div-curl-transport part. Our main new contribution
is our analysis of the positive co-dimension, spacelike boundary integrals that arise in the div-curl
identities. By exploiting interplay between the elliptic and hyperbolic parts of the new formulation,
we observe several crucial cancellations, which in total show that the boundary terms have a good
sign.
