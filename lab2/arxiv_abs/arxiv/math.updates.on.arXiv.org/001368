Grotzsch proved that every triangle-free planar graph is 3-colorable. Thomassen proved that every
planar graph of girth at least five is 3-choosable. As for other surfaces, Thomassen proved that
there are only finitely many 4-critical graphs of girth at least five embeddable in any fixed surface.
This implies a linear-time algorithm for deciding 3-colorablity for graphs of girth at least five
on any fixed surface. Dvorak, Kral and Thomas strengthened Thomassen's result by proving that the
number of vertices in a 4-critical graph of girth at least five is linear in its genus. They used this
result to prove Havel's conjecture that a planar graph whose triangles are pairwise far enough apart
is 3-colorable. As for list-coloring, Dvorak proved that a planar graph whose cycles of size at most
four are pairwise far enough part is 3-choosable. In this article, we generalize these results.
First we prove a linear isoperimetric bound for 3-list-coloring graphs of girth at least five. Many
new results then follow from the theory of hyperbolic families of graphs developed by Postle and
Thomas. In particular, it follows that there are only finitely many 4-list-critical graphs of girth
at least five on any fixed surface, and that in fact the number of vertices of a 4-list-critical graph
is linear in its genus. This provides independent proofs of the above results while generalizing
Dvorak's result to graphs on surfaces that have large edge-width and yields a similar result showing
that a graph of girth at least five with crossings pairwise far apart is 3-choosable. Finally, we
generalize to surfaces Thomassen's result that every planar graph of girth at least five has exponentially
many distinct 3-list-colorings. Specifically, we show that every graph of girth at least five that
has a 3-list-coloring has $2^{\Omega(n)-O(g)}$ distinct 3-list-colorings.
