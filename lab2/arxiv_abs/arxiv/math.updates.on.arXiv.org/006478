We initiate a study of the following problem: Given a continuous domain $\Omega$ along with its convex
hull $\mathcal{K}$, a point $A \in \mathcal{K}$ and a prior measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$, find the probability
density over $\Omega$ whose marginal is $A$ and that minimizes the KL-divergence to $\mu$. This
framework gives rise to several extremal distributions that arise in mathematics, quantum mechanics,
statistics, and theoretical computer science. Our technical contributions include a polynomial
bound on the norm of the optimizer of the dual problem that holds in a very general setting and relies
on a "balance" property of the measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$, and exact algorithms for evaluating the
dual and its gradient for several interesting settings of $\Omega$ and $\mu$. Together, along with
the ellipsoid method, these results imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute such KL-divergence
minimizing distributions in several cases. Applications of our results include: 1) an optimization
characterization of the Goemans-Williamson measure that is used to round a positive semidefinite
matrix to a vector, 2) the computability of the entropic barrier for polytopes studied by Bubeck
and Eldan, and 3) a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the barycentric quantum entropy of a density
matrix that was proposed as an alternative to von Neumann entropy in the 1970s: this corresponds
to the case when $\Omega$ is the set of rank one projections matrices and $\mu$ corresponds to the
Haar measure on the unit sphere. Our techniques generalize to the setting of Hermitian rank $k$ projections
using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula, and are applicable even beyond, to adjoint
orbits of compact Lie groups.
