We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equation in flat cosmological
spacetimes driven by a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the scalar curvature.
In the semiclassical approximation, the backreaction of matter to curvature is taken into account
by equating the Einstein tensor to the expectation values of the stress-energy tensor in a suitable
state. We impose initial conditions for the scale factor at finite time and we show that a regular
state for the quantum matter compatible with these initial conditions can be chosen. Contributions
with derivative of the coefficient of the metric higher than the second are present in the expectation
values of the stress-energy tensor and the term with the highest derivative appears in a non-local
form. This fact forbids a direct analysis of the semiclassical equation, and in particular, standard
recursive approaches to approximate the solution fail to converge. In this paper we show that, after
partial integration of the semiclassical Einstein equation in cosmology, the non-local highest
derivative appears in the expectation values of the stress-energy tensor through the application
of a linear unbounded operator which does not depend on the details of the chosen state. We prove that
an inversion formula for this operator can be found, furthermore, the inverse happens to be more
regular than the direct operator and it has the form of a retarded product, hence causality is respected.
The found inversion formula applied to the traced Einstein equation has thus the form of a fixed point
equation. The proof of local existence and uniqueness of the solution of the semiclassical Einstein
equation is then obtained applying the Banach fixed point theorem.
