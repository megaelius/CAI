Given a completely arbitrary surface, whether or not it has bounded curvature, or even whether or
not it is complete, there exists an instantaneously complete Ricci flow evolution of that surface
that exists for a specific amount of time [GT11]. In the case that the underlying Riemann surface
supports a hyperbolic metric, this Ricci flow always exists for all time and converges (after scaling
by a factor $\frac1{2t}$) to this hyperbolic metric [GT11], i.e. our Ricci flow geometrises the
surface. In this paper we show that there exist complete, bounded curvature initial metrics, including
those conformal to a hyperbolic metric, which have subsequent Ricci flows developing unbounded
curvature at certain intermediate times. In particular, when coupled with the uniqueness from
[Top13], we find that any complete Ricci flow starting with such initial metrics must develop unbounded
curvature over some intermediate time interval, but that nevertheless, the curvature must later
become bounded and the flow must achieve geometrisation as $t\to\infty$, even though there are
other conformal deformations to hyperbolic metrics that do not involve unbounded curvature. Another
consequence of our constructions is that while our Ricci flow from [GT11] must agree initially with
the classical flow of Hamilton and Shi in the special case that the initial surface is complete and
of bounded curvature, by uniqueness, it is now clear that our flow lasts for a longer time interval
in general, with Shi's flow stopping when the curvature blows up, but our flow continuing strictly
beyond in these situations. All our constructions of unbounded curvature developing and then disappearing
are in two dimensions. Generalisations to higher dimensions are then immediate.
