Motivated by applications in cancer genomics and following the work of Hajirasouliha and Raphael
(WABI 2014), Hujdurovi\'c et al. (IEEE TCBB, to appear) introduced the minimum conflict-free row
split (MCRS) problem: split each row of a given binary matrix into a bitwise OR of a set of rows so that
the resulting matrix corresponds to a perfect phylogeny and has the minimum possible number of rows
among all matrices with this property. Hajirasouliha and Raphael also proposed the study of a similar
problem, in which the task is to minimize the number of distinct rows of the resulting matrix. Hujdurovi\'c
et al. proved that both problems are NP-hard, gave a related characterization of transitively orientable
graphs, and proposed a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for the MCRS problem based on coloring
cocomparability graphs. We give new, more transparent formulations of the two problems, showing
that the problems are equivalent to two optimization problems on branchings in a derived directed
acyclic graph. Building on these formulations, we obtain new results on the two problems, including:
(i) a strengthening of the heuristic by Hujdurovi\'c et al. via a new min-max result in digraphs generalizing
Dilworth's theorem, which may be of independent interest, (ii) APX-hardness results for both problems,
(iii) approximation algorithms, and (iv) exponential-time algorithms solving the two problems
to optimality faster than the na\"ive brute-force approach. Our work relates to several well studied
notions in combinatorial optimization: chain partitions in partially ordered sets, laminar hypergraphs,
and (classical and weighted) colorings of graphs.
