In this paper, we study the local distribution of roots of random functions of the form $F_n(z)= \sum_{i=1}^n
\xi_i \phi_i(z) $, where $\xi_i$ are independent random variables and $\phi_i (z) $ are arbitrary
analytic functions. Starting with the fundamental works of Kac and Littlewood-Offord in the 1940s,
random functions of this type have been studied in many fields of mathematics. We develop a robust
framework to solve the problem by reducing, via universality theorems, the calculation of the distribution
of the roots and the interaction between them to the case where $\xi_i$ are gaussian. In this special
case, one can use Kac-Rice formula and various other tools to obtain precise answers. Our frame work
has a wide range of applications, which includes random trigonometric polynomials with general
coefficients and all basic classes of random algebraic polynomials (Kac, Weyl, and elliptic).
Each of these ensembles has been studied heavily by deep and diverse methods. Our method, for the
first time, provides a unified treatment to all of them. Among the applications, we derive the first
local universality result for general random trigonometric polynomials. Even when restricted
to the study of real roots, this result already extends several existing and very recent results.
For random algebraic polynomials, we strengthen several recent result of Tao and the second author,
with significantly simpler proofs. As a corollary, we sharpen a classical result of Erdos and Offord
on real roots of Kac polynomials, providing an optimal error estimate. Another application is a
refinement of a recent result of Kabluchko and Zaporozhets on complex roots of random analytic functions.
