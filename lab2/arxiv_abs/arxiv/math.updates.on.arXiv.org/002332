We consider some general aspects of dependence of magneto-conductivity on a magnetic field in metals
having complicated Fermi surfaces. As it is well known, a nontrivial behavior of conductivity in
metals in strong magnetic fields is connected usually with appearance of non-closed quasiclassical
electron trajectories on the Fermi surface in a magnetic field. The structure of the electron trajectories
depends strongly on the direction of the magnetic field and usually the greatest interest is caused
by open trajectories that are stable to small rotations of the direction of $\, {\bf B} $. The geometry
of the corresponding Stability Zones on the angular diagram in the space of directions of $\, {\bf
B} \, $ represents a very important characteristic of the electron spectrum in a metal linking the
parameters of the spectrum to the experimental data. Here we will consider some very general features
inherent in the angular diagrams of metals with Fermi surfaces of the most arbitrary form. In particular,
we will show here that any Stability Zone actually has a second boundary, restricting a larger region
with a certain behavior of conductivity. Besides that, we shall discuss here general questions
of complexity of the angular diagrams for the conductivity and propose a theoretical scheme for
dividing the angular diagrams into "simple" and "complex" diagrams. The proposed scheme will in
fact also be closely related to behavior of the Hall conductivity in a metal in strong magnetic fields.
In conclusion, we will also discuss the relationship of the questions under consideration to the
general features of an (abstract) angular diagram describing the behavior of quasiclassical electron
trajectories at all energy levels in the conduction band.
