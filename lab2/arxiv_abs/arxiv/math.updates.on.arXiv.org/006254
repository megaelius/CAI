The sparse factorization of a large matrix is fundamental in modern statistical learning. In particular,
the sparse singular value decomposition and its variants have been utilized in multivariate regression,
factor analysis, biclustering, vector time series modeling, among others. The appeal of this factorization
is owing to its power in discovering a highly-interpretable latent association network, either
between samples and variables or between responses and predictors. However, many existing methods
are either ad hoc without a general performance guarantee, or are computationally intensive, rendering
them unsuitable for large-scale studies. We formulate the statistical problem as a sparse factor
regression and tackle it with a divide-and-conquer approach. In the first stage of division, we
consider both sequential and parallel approaches for simplifying the task into a set of co-sparse
unit-rank estimation (CURE) problems, and establish the statistical underpinnings of these commonly-adopted
and yet poorly understood deflation methods. In the second stage of division, we innovate a contended
stagewise learning technique, consisting of a sequence of simple incremental updates, to efficiently
trace out the whole solution paths of CURE. Our algorithm has a much lower computational complexity
than alternating convex search, and the choice of the step size enables a flexible and principled
tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Our work is among the first
to enable stagewise learning for non-convex problems, and the idea can be applicable in many multi-convex
problems. Extensive simulation studies and an application in genetics demonstrate the effectiveness
and scalability of our approach.
