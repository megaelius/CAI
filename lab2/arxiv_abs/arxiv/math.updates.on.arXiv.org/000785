The use of the millimeter (mm) wave spectrum for next generation (5G) mobile communication has gained
significant attention recently. The small carrier wavelengths at mmwave frequencies enable synthesis
of compact antenna arrays, providing beamforming gains that compensate the increased propagation
losses. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of employing multiple antenna arrays to obtain
diversity/multiplexing gains in mmwave systems, where each of the arrays is capable of beamforming
independently. Considering a codebook based beamforming system (e.g., to facilitate limited
feedback), we observe that the complexity of \emph{jointly} optimizing the beamforming directions
across the multiple arrays is highly prohibitive, even for very reasonable system parameters.
To overcome this bottleneck, we develop reduced complexity algorithms for optimizing the choice
of beamforming directions, premised on the sparse multipath structure of the mmwave channel. Specifically,
we reduce the cardinality of the joint beamforming search space, by restricting attention to a small
set of dominant candidate directions. To obtain the set of dominant directions, we develop two complementary
approaches: (a) based on computation of a novel spatial power metric; a detailed analysis of this
metric shows that, in the limit of large antenna arrays, the selected candidate directions approach
the channel's dominant angles of arrival and departure, and (b) precise estimation of the channel's
(long-term) dominant angles of arrival, exploiting the correlations of the signals received across
the different receiver subarrays. Our methods enable a drastic reduction of the optimization search
space (a factor of 100 reduction), while delivering close to optimal performance, thereby indicating
the potential feasibility of achieving diversity and multiplexing gains in mmwave systems.
