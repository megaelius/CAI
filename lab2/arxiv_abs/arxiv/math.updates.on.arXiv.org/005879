It is know that the Valdivia compact spaces can be characterized by a special family of retractions
called $r$-skeleton (see \cite{kubis1}). Also we know that there are compact spaces with $r$-skeletons
which are not Valdivia. In this paper, we shall study $r$-squeletons and special families of closed
subsets of compact spaces. We prove that if $X$ is a zero-dimensional compact space and $\{r_s:s\in
\Gamma\}$ is an $r$-skeleton on $X$ such that $|r_s(X)| \leq \omega$ for all $s\in \Gamma$, then
$X$ has a dense subset consisting of isolated points. Also we give conditions to an $r$-skeleton
in order that this $r$-skeleton can be extended to an $r$-skeleton on the Alexandroff Duplicate
of the base space. The standard definition of a Valdivia compact spaces is via a $\Sigma$-product
of a power of the unit interval. Following this fact we introduce the notion of $\pi$-skeleton on
a compact space $X$ by embedding $X$ in a suitable power of the unit interval together with a pair $(\mathcal{F},\varphi)$,
where $\mathcal{F}$ is family of metric separable subspaces of $X$ and $\varphi$ an $\omega$-monotone
function which satisfy certain properties. This new notion generalize the idea of a $\Sigma$-product.
We prove that a compact space admits a retractional-skeleton iff it admits a $\pi$-skeleton. This
equivalence allows to give a new proof of the fact that the product of compact spaces with retractional-skeletons
admits an retractional-skeleton (see \cite{cuth1}). In \cite{casa1}, the Corson compact spaces
are characterized by a special family of closed subsets. Following this direction, we introduce
the notion of weak $c$-skeleton which under certain conditions characterizes the Valdivia compact
spaces and compact spaces with $r$-skeletons.
