Ergodicity of random dynamical systems in the random periodic regime where a periodic measure exists
on a Polish space is obtained. In the Markovian random dynamical systems case, the idea of Poincar\'e
sections is introduced. It is proved that if the $\tau$-periodic measure is PS-ergodic, then it
is ergodic. Moreover, if the infinitesimal generator of the Markov semigroup has only $\{{2m\pi\over\tilde\tau}i\}_{m\in{\mathbb
Z}}$ as simple eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, where $\tilde \tau={\tau\over k}$ for some $k\in{\mathbb
N}\setminus\{0\}$, then the periodic measure is PS-ergodic. Furthermore, if the semigroup on
Poincar\'e sections has spectral gap, then the periodic measure is PS-mixing. The distinction
between random periodic and stationary regimes is given by a sufficient and necessary condition
in terms of the spectral structure of the infinitesimal generators. In particular if the $\tau$-periodic
measure is PS-mixing, then the infinitesimal generator of the Markovian semigroup has only $\{{2lm\pi\over\tau}i\}_{m\in{\mathbb
Z}}$ for some $l\in{\mathbb N}\setminus\{0\}$ as simple eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, if
and only if the minimal period of the periodic measure is $\tilde\tau={\tau\over k}$ for some $k\in{\mathbb
N}\setminus\{0\}$. The ergodicity is extended to the periodic stochastic semi-flows that is lifted
up to a cocycle on the cylinder $[0,\tau)\times{\mathbb X}$. It is proved that the infinitesimal
generator of the Markovian semigroup of the lifted periodic diffusion process on a finite dimensional
Euclidian space has the desired spectral property if the generator of the diffusion has only one
simple eigenvalue $0$ on the imaginary axis for each fixed time. The "equivalence" of random periodic
processes and periodic measures is established. The strong law of large numbers is also proved.
