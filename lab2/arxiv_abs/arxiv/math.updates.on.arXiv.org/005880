Following a disaster, humanitarian logistics providers have two major responsibilities: locating
trapped people and routing aid to them. These difficult operations are further hindered by failures
in the transportation and communications networks, often rendered unusable by the disaster. In
this work, we propose a two-echelon vehicle routing problem framework for performing these operations
using aerial uncrewed autonomous vehicles (UAVs or drones). Our setup employs ground vehicles
carrying drones that serve to both identify demands for medical and other aid (e.g., epi-pens, medical
supplies, dry food, water) and satisfy them. We present a deterministic and a stochastic approach
for handling the emergency aid delivery problem faced by such a humanitarian logistics provider.
In the deterministic approach, we consider two types of drones: hotspot drones for capturing demand
and delivery drones for satisfying demand. We present a framework to identify optimal routes for
both types of drones following a column-generation scheme. In the stochastic case, we avoid the
extra cost of using hotspot drones to capture demands deterministically and develop a two-stage
robust optimization framework to handle the resulting demand uncertainty. To solve the resulting
two-stage robust model for the two-echelon vehicle and drone routing problem, we combine an outer
level column-and constraint-generation (CCG) method with an inner level column generation (CG)
scheme. We present a case study based on real-life data from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and showcase
the applicability of our framework. The data generated for this research is available online at
