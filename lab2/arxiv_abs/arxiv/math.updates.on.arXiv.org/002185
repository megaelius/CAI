Applications in control, robotics, and optimization motivate the design of systems by selecting
system elements, such as actuators, sensors, or data, subject to complex design constraints that
require the system elements not only to be a few in number, but also, to satisfy heterogeneity or global-interdependency
constraints; in particular, matroid constraints. However, in failure-prone and adversarial
environments, sensors get attacked; actuators fail; data get deleted. Thence, traditional matroid-constrained
design paradigms become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient matroid-constrained designs
against attacks, failures, or deletions become important. In general, resilient matroid-constrained
design problems are computationally hard. Also, even though they often involve objective functions
that are monotone and (possibly) submodular, no scalable approximation algorithms are known for
their solution. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm, that achieves the following characteristics:
system-wide resiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks,
deletions, or failures; minimal running time, i.e., the algorithm terminates with the same running
time as state-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient) matroid-constrained optimization;
and provable approximation performance, i.e., the algorithm guarantees for monotone objective
functions a solution close to the optimal. We quantify the algorithm's approximation performance
using a notion of curvature for monotone (not necessarily submodular) set functions. Finally,
we support our theoretical analyses with numerical experiments, by considering a control-aware
sensor selection scenario, namely, sensing-constrained robot navigation.
