Let $(V,\omega)$ be an orthosympectic $\mathbb Z_2$-graded vector space and let $\mathfrak g:=\mathfrak{gosp}(V,\omega)$
denote the Lie superalgebra of similitudes of $(V,\omega)$. When the space $\mathscr P(V)$ of superpolynomials
on $V$ is \emph{not} a completely reducible $\mathfrak g$-module, we construct a natural basis
$D_\lambda$ of Capelli operators for the algebra of $\mathfrak g$-invariant superpolynomial
superdifferential operators on $V$, where the index set $\mathcal P$ is the set of integer partitions
of length at most two. We compute the action of the operators $D_\lambda$ on maximal indecomposable
components of $\mathscr P(V)$ explicitly, in terms of Knop-Sahi interpolation polynomials. Our
results show that, unlike the cases where $\mathscr P(V)$ is completely reducible, the eigenvalues
of a subfamily of the $D_\lambda$ are \emph{not} given by specializing the Knop-Sahi polynomials.
Rather, the formulas for these eigenvalues involve suitably regularized forms of these polynomials.
In addition, we demonstrate a close relationship between our eigenvalue formulas for this subfamily
of Capelli operators and the Dougall-Ramanujan hypergeometric identity. We also transcend our
results on the eigenvalues of Capelli operators to the Deligne category $\mathsf{Rep}(O_t)$.
More precisely, we define categorical Capelli operators $\{\mathbf D_{t,\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in\mathcal
P}^{}$ that induce morphisms of indecomposable components of symmetric powers of $\mathsf V_t$,
where $\mathsf V_t$ is the generating object of $\mathsf{Rep}(O_t)$. We obtain formulas for the
eigenvalue polynomials associated to the $\left\{\mathbf D_{t,\lambda}\right\}_{\lambda\in\mathcal
P}$ that are analogous to our results for the operators $\{D_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\mathcal P}^{}$.
