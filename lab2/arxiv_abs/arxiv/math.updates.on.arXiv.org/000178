Much like in the theory of algebraic geometry, we develop a correspondence between certain types
of algebraic and geometric objects. The basic algebraic environment we work in is the a semifield
of fractions H(x1,...,xn) of the polynomial semidomain H[x1,...,xn], where H is taken to be an idempotent
semifield, while for the geometric environment we have the space H^n. We show that taking H to be idempotent
makes both H(x1,...,xn) and Hn idempotent which turn out to satisfy many desired properties that
we utilize for our construction. The fundamental algebraic and geometric objects having interrelations
are called kernels, encapsulating congruences over semifields and skeletons which serve as the
analog for zero-sets of algebraic geometry. As an analog for the celebrated Nullstellenzats theorem,
we develop a correspondence between skeletons and a family of kernels called polars originally
developed in the theory of lattice-ordered groups. For a special kind of skeletons, called principal
skeletons, we have simplified the correspondence by restricting our algebraic environment to
a certain kernel of H(x1,...,xn). After establishing the linkage between kernels and skeletons
we proceed to construct a second linkage, this time between a family of skeletons and what we call
"corner-loci". Essentially a corner locus is what is called a tropical variety in the theory of tropical
geometry, which is a set of corner roots of some set of tropical polynomials. A skeleton and a corner-locus
define the exact same subset of H^n in different ways: while a corner locus is defined by corner roots
of tropical polynomials, the skeleton is defined by equating fractions from H(x1,...,xn) to 1.
All the connections presented above form a path connecting a tropical variety to a certain kind of
kernel.
