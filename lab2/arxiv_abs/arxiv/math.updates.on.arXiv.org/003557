This paper presents a multilevel convergence framework for multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT)
as a generalization of previous two-grid estimates. The framework provides a priori upper bounds
on the convergence of MGRIT V- and F-cycles with different relaxation schemes by deriving the respective
residual and error propagation operators. The residual and error operators are functions of the
time stepping operator, analyzed directly and bounded in norm, both numerically and analytically.
We present various upper bounds of different computational cost and varying sharpness. These upper
bounds are complemented by proposing analytic formulae for the approximate convergence factor
of V-cycle algorithms that take the number of fine grid time points, the temporal coarsening factors,
and the eigenvalues of the time stepping operator as parameters. The paper concludes with supporting
numerical investigations of parabolic and hyperbolic model problems. We assess the sharpness
of the bounds and the quality of the approximate convergence factors. Observations from these numerical
investigations demonstrate the value of the proposed multilevel convergence framework for the
design of a convergent MGRIT algorithm. We further highlight that observations in the literature
are captured by the theory, including that two-level Parareal and multilevel MGRIT with F-relaxation
do not yield scalable algorithms, that iteration counts increase with increasing numbers of levels,
and the benefit of a stronger relaxation scheme. The theory also proves in a two-level setting, and
confirms for multilevel, that L-stable Runge-Kutta schemes are more amendable to parallel-in-time
integration with MGRIT than A-stable Runge-Kutta schemes.
