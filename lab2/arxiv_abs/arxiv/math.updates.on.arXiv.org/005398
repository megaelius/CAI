For every square matrix $A$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$, we have the equality $\mathrm{rank}(A) +
\mathrm{rank}(I-A) = \mathrm{rank}(I) + \mathrm{rank}(A-A^2)$. In this article, we start a program
to systematically characterize and generalize such rank identities with a view towards applications
to operator algebras. We initiate the study of so-called ranked rings (unital rings with a `rank-system'),
the main examples of interest being finite von Neumann algebras and Murray-von Neumann algebras.
In our framework, a field $\mathbb{K}$ may be viewed as a ranked ring with a $\mathbb{Z}^+$-valued
rank-system consisting of the usual rank functions on $M_n(\mathbb{K})$ (for $n \in \mathbb{N})$
and serves as the motivating example. We show that a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{R}$ with
center $\mathscr{C}$ (and the corresponding Murray-von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{R}_{\textrm{aff}}$)
may be endowed with a $\mathscr{C}^{+}$-valued rank-system, considering $\mathscr{C}^{+}$
as a commutative monoid with respect to operator addition. We give an algorithm to generate rank
identities in ranked $\mathbb{K}$-algebras via the polynomial function calculus, and in ranked
complex Banach algebras via the holomorphic function calculus. As an illustrative application,
using these abstract rank identities we show that the sum of finitely many (not necessarily self-adjoint)
idempotents $E_1, \cdots, E_m$ in a finite von Neumann algebra is an idempotent if and only if they
are mutually orthogonal, that is, $E_i E_j = \delta_{ij}E_i$ for $1\le i, j \le m$. In contrast, this
does not hold in general in the ring of bounded operators on an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert
space.
