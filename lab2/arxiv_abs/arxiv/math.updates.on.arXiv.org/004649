We study from an algebraic point of view the question of extending an action of a group \(\Gamma\)
on a commutative domain \(R\) to a formal pseudodifferential operator ring \(B=R(\!(x\,;\,d)\!)\)
with coefficients in \(R\), as well as to some canonical quadratic extension \(C=R(\!(x^{1/2}\,;\,\frac
12 d)\!)_2\) of \(B\). We give a necessary and sufficient condition of compatibility between the
action and the derivation $d$ of $R$ for such an extension to exist, and we determine all possible
extensions of the action to \(B\) and \(C\). We describe under suitable assumptions the invariant
subalgebras \(B^\Gamma\) and \(C^\Gamma\) as Laurent series rings with coefficients in \(R^\Gamma\).
The main results of this general study are applied in a numbertheoretical context to the case where
\(\Gamma\) is a subgroup of \({\rm SL}(2,\C)\) acting by homographies on an algebra \(R\) of functions
in one complex variable. Denoting by \(M_j\) the vector space of algebraic modular forms in $R$ of
weight \(j\) (even or odd), we build for any nonnegative integer \(k\) a linear isomorphism between
the subspace \(C_k^\Gamma\) of invariant operators of order \(\geq k\) in \(C^\Gamma\) and the
product space \(\mathcal{M}_k=\prod_{j\geq k}M_j\), which can be identified with a space of algebraic
Jacobi forms of weight \(k\). It results in particular a structure of noncommutative algebra on
\(\mathcal M_0\) and an algebra isomorphism \(\Psi:\mathcal M_0\to C_0^\Gamma\), whose restriction
to the particular case of even weights was previously known in the litterature. We study properties
of this correspondence combining arithmetical arguments and the use of the algebraic results of
the first part of the article.
