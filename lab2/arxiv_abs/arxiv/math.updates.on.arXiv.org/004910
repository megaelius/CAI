By Solovay's celebrated completeness result on formal provability we know that the provability
logic $\mathrm GL$ describes exactly all provable structural properties for any sound and strong
enough arithmetical theory with a decidable axiomatisation. Japaridze generalised this result
by considering a polymodal version $\mathrm GLP$ of $\mathrm GL$ with modalities $[n]$ for each
natural number $n$ referring to ever increasing notions of provability. Modern treatments of $\mathrm
GLP$ tend to interpret the $[n]$ provability notion as "provable in a base theory $T$ together with
all true $\Pi^0_n$ formulas as oracles". In this paper we generalise this interpretation into the
transfinite. In order to do so, a main difficulty to overcome is to generalise the syntactical characterisations
of the oracle formulas of complexity $\Pi^0_n$ to the hyper-arithmetical hierarchy. The paper
exploits the fact that provability is $\Sigma^0_1$ complete and that similar results hold for stronger
provability notions. As such, the oracle sentences to define provability at level $\alpha$ will
recursively be taken to be consistency statements at lower levels: provability through provability
whence the name of the paper. The paper proves soundness and completeness for the proposed interpretation
for a wide class of theories; namely for any theory that can formalise the recursion described above
and that has some further very natural properties. Some remarks are provided on how the recursion
can be formalised into second order arithmetic and on lowering the proof-theoretical strength
of these systems of second order arithmetic.
