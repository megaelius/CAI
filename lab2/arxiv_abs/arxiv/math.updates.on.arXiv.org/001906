In this paper we prove results on Birkhoff and Oseledets genericity along certain curves in the space
of affine lattices and in moduli spaces of translation surfaces. We also prove applications of these
results to dynamical billiards, mathematical physics and number theory. In the space of affine
lattices $ASL_2(\mathbb{R})/ASL_2( \mathbb{Z})$, we prove that almost every point on a curve
with some non-degeneracy assumptions is Birkhoff generic for the geodesic flow. This implies almost
everywhere genericity for some curves in the locus of branched covers of the torus inside the stratum
$\mathcal{H}(1,1)$ of translation surfaces. For these curves (and more in general curves which
are well-approximated by horocycle arcs and satisfy almost everywhere Birkhoff genericity) we
also prove that almost every point is Oseledets generic for the Kontsevitch-Zorich cocycle, generalizing
a recent result by Chaika and Eskin. As applications, we first consider a class of pseudo-integrable
billiards, billiards in ellipses with barriers, which was recently explored by Dragovic and Radnovic,
and prove that for almost every parameter, the billiard flow is uniquely ergodic within the region
of phase space in which it is trapped. We then consider any periodic array of Eaton retroreflector
lenses, placed on vertices of a lattice, and prove that in almost every direction light rays are each
confined to a band of finite width. This generalizes a phenomenon recently discovered by Fraczek
and Schmoll which could so far only be proved for random periodic configurations. Finally, a result
on the gap distribution of fractional parts of the sequence of square roots of positive integers,
which extends previous work by Elkies and McMullen, is also obtained.
