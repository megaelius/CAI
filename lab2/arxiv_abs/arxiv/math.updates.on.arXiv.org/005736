We obtain many results and solve some problems about feebly compact paratopological groups. We
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for such a group to be topological. One of them is the
quasiregularity. We prove that each $2$-pseudocompact paratopological group is feebly compact
and that each Hausdorff $\sigma$-compact feebly compact paratopological group is a compact topological
group. Our particular attention concerns periodic and topologically periodic groups. We construct
examples of various compact-like paratopological groups which are not topological groups, among
them a $T_0$ sequentially compact group, a $T_1$ $2$-pseudocompact group, a functionally Hausdorff
countably compact group (under the axiomatic assumption that there is an infinite torsion-free
abelian countably compact topological group without non-trivial convergent sequences), and
a functionally Hausdorff second countable group sequentially pracompact group. We investigate
cone topologies of paratopological groups which provide a general tool to construct pathological
examples, especially examples of compact-like paratopological groups with discontinuous inversion.
We find a simple interplay between the algebraic properties of a basic cone subsemigroup $S$ of a
group $G$ and compact-like properties of two basic semigroup topologies generated by $S$ on the
group $G$. We prove that the product of a family of feebly compact paratopological groups is feebly
compact, and that a paratopological group $G$ is feebly compact provided it has a feebly compact
normal subgroup $H$ such that a quotient group $G/H$ is feebly compact.
