We prove an analogue of the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture in the context of SO(3) monopoles, obtaining
a formula relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth four-manifolds using
the SO(3)-monopole cobordism. The main technical difficulty in the SO(3)-monopole program relating
the Seiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants has been to compute intersection pairings on links
of strata of reducible SO(3) monopoles, namely the moduli spaces of Seiberg-Witten monopoles lying
in lower-level strata of the Uhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space of SO(3) monopoles
[ arXiv:dg-ga/9710032 ]. In this monograph, we prove --- modulo a gluing theorem which is an extension
of our earlier work in [ arXiv:math/9907107 ] --- that these intersection pairings can be expressed
in terms of topological data and Seiberg-Witten invariants of the four-manifold. This conclusion
is analogous to the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture concerning the wall-crossing formula for Donaldson
invariants of a four-manifold with $b_2^+=1$; that wall-crossing formula and the resulting structure
of Donaldson invariants for four-manifolds with $b_2^+=1$ were established, assuming the Kotschick-Morgan
conjecture, by Goettsche [ arXiv:alg-geom/9506018 ] and Goettsche and Zagier [ arXiv:alg-geom/9612020
]. In this monograph, we reduce the proof of the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture to an extension of previously
established gluing theorems for anti-self-dual SO(3) connections (see [ arXiv:math/9812060
] and references therein). Since the first version of our monograph was circulated, applications
of our results have appeared in the proof of Property P for knots by Kronheimer and Mrowka [ arXiv:math/0311489
] and work of Sivek on Donaldson invariants for symplectic four-manifolds [ arXiv:1301.0377 ].
