Equivalence of convex optimization, saddle-point problems, and variational inequalities is
a well-established concept. The variational inequality (VI) is a static problem which is studied
under dynamical settings using a framework called the projected dynamical system, whose stationary
points coincide with the static solutions of the associated VI. VI has rich properties concerning
the monotonicity of its vector-valued map and the uniqueness of its solution, which can be extended
to convex optimization and saddle-point problems. Moreover, these properties also extend to the
representative projected dynamical system. The objective of this paper is to harness rich monotonicity
properties of the representative projected dynamical system to develop the solution concepts
of the convex optimization problem and the associated saddle-point problem. To this end, this paper
studies a linear inequality constrained convex optimization problem and models its equivalent
saddle-point problem as a VI. Further, the VI is studied as a projected dynamical system\cite{friesz1994day}
which is shown to converge to the saddle-point solution. By considering the monotonicity of the
gradient of Lagrangian function as a key factor, this paper establishes exponential convergence
and stability results concerning the saddle-points. Our results show that the gradient of the Lagrangian
function is just monotone on the Euclidean space, leading to only Lyapunov stability of stationary
points of the projected dynamical system. To remedy the situation, the underlying projected dynamical
system is formulated on a Riemannian manifold whose Riemannian metric is chosen such that the gradient
of the Lagrangian function becomes strongly monotone. Using a suitable Lyapunov function, the
stationary points of the projected dynamical system are proved to be globally exponentially stable
and convergent to the unique saddle-point.
