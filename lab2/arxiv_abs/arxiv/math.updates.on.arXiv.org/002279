Gog and Magog trapezoids are certain arrays of positive integers that generalize alternating sign
matrices (ASMs) and totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions (TSSCPPs) respectively.
Zeilberger used constant term formulas to prove that there is the same number of (n,k)-Gog trapezoids
as there is of (n,k)-Magog trapezoids, thereby providing so far the only proof for a weak version
of a conjecture by Mills, Robbins and Rumsey from 1986. About 20 years ago, Krattenthaler generalized
Gog and Magog trapezoids and formulated an extension of their conjecture, and, recently, Biane
and Cheballah generalized Gog trapezoids further and formulated a related conjecture. In this
paper, we derive constant term formulas for various refined enumerations of generalized Gog trapezoids
including those considered by Krattenthaler and by Biane and Cheballah. For this purpose we employ
a result on the enumeration of truncated monotone triangles which is in turn based in the author's
operator formula for the number of monotone triangles with prescribed bottom row. As a byproduct,
we also generalize the operator formula for monotone triangles by including the inversion number
and the complementary inversion number for ASMs. Constant term formulas as well as determinant
formulas for the refined Magog trapezoid numbers that appear in Krattenthaler's conjecture are
also deduced by using the classical approach based on non-intersecting lattice paths and the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot
theorem. Finally, we review and partly extend a few existing tools that may be helpful in relating
constant term formulas for Gogs to those for Magogs to eventually prove the above mentioned conjectures.
