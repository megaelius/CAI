In this work, we are concerned with the mathematical modeling of the electromagnetic (EM) scattering
by arbitrarily shaped non-magnetic nanoparticles with high refractive indices. When illuminated
by visible light, these particles can exhibit a very strong isotropic magnetic response, in addition
to the electric resonance, resulting from the coupling of the incident wave with the circular displacement
currents of the EM fields. We shall first introduce the mathematical concept of dielectric (subwavelength)
resonances, then perform the asymptotic analysis in terms of the small particle size and the high
contrast parameter. This enables us to derive the a priori estimates for the leading-order terms
of dielectric resonances and the associated resonant modes, by making use of a Helmholtz decomposition
for divergence-free vector fields. It turns out that these dielectric resonant fields are almost
transverse electric in the quasi-static and high contrast regime, and hence present the feature
of the magnetostatic fields. To address the existence of resonances, we apply the Gohberg-Sigal
theory under a physical condition for the contrast, and show that there exist finitely many physically
meaningful resonances in the fourth quadrant. The second part of this work is for the quantitative
investigation of the enhancement of the scattered field and the cross-sections when the dielectric
resonance occurs. In doing so, we develop a novel multipole radiation framework that directly separates
the electric and magnetic multipole moments and allows us to clearly see their orders of magnitude
and blow-up rates. We show that at the dielectric subwavelength resonant frequencies, the nanoparticles
with high refractive indices behave like the coupling of an electric dipole with a resonant magnetic
dipole.
