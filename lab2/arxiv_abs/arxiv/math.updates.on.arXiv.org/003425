This study addresses the question of the quantitative reconstruction of heterogeneous distributions
of isotropic elastic moduli from full strain field data. This parameter identification problem
exposes the need for a local reconstruction procedure that is investigated here in the case of materials
with small contrast. To begin with the integral formulation framework for the periodic linear elasticity
problem, first- and second-order asymptotics are retained for the strain field solution and the
effective elasticity tensor. Properties of the featured Green's tensor are investigated to characterize
its decomposition into an isotropic term and an orthogonal part. The former is then shown to define
a local contribution to the volume integral equations considered. Based on this property, then
the combination of multiple strain field solutions corresponding to well-chosen applied macroscopic
strains is shown to lead to a set of local and uncoupled identities relating, respectively, the bulk
and shear moduli to the spherical and deviatoric components of the strain fields. Valid at the first-order
in the weak contrast limit, such relations permit point-wise conversions of strain maps into elasticity
maps. Furthermore, it is also shown that for macroscopically isotropic material configurations
a single strain field solution is actually sufficient to reconstruct either the bulk or the shear
modulus distribution. Those results are then revisited in the case of bounded media. Finally, some
sets of analytical and numerical examples are provided for comparison and to illustrate the relevance
of the obtained strain-modulus local equations for a parameter identification method based on
full-field data.
