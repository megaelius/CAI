Following Britz, Johnsen, Mayhew and Shiromoto, we consider demi\-ma\-troids as a(nother) natural
generalization of matroids. As they have shown, demi\-ma\-troids are the appropriate combinatorial
objects for studying Wei's duality. Our results here apport further evidence about the trueness
of that observation. We define the Hamming polynomial of a demimatroid $M$, denoted by $W(x,y,t)$,
as a generalization of the extended Hamming weight enumerator of a matroid. The polynomial $W(x,y,t)$
is a specialization of the Tutte polynomial of $M$, and actually is equivalent to it. Guided by work
of Johnsen, Roksvold and Verdure for matroids, we prove that Betti numbers of a demimatroid and its
elongations determine the Hamming polynomial. Our results may be applied to simplicial complexes
since in a canonical way they can be viewed as demimatroids. Furthermore, following work of Brylawski
and Gordon, we show how demimatroids may be generalized one step further, to combinatroids. A combinatroid,
or Brylawski structure, is an integer valued function $\rho$, defined over the power set of a finite
ground set, satisfying the only condition $\rho(\emptyset)=0$. Even in this extreme generality,
we will show that many concepts and invariants in coding theory can be carried on directly to combinatroids,
say, Tutte polynomial, characteristic polynomial, MacWilliams identity, extended Hamming polynomial,
and the $r$-th generalized Hamming polynomial; this last one, at least conjecturelly, guided by
the work of Jurrius and Pellikaan for linear codes. All this largely extends the notions of deletion,
contraction, duality and codes to non-matroidal structures.
