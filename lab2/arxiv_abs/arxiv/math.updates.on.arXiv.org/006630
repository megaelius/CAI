A general definition of mathematical morphology has been defined within the algebraic framework
of complete lattice theory. In this framework, dealing with deterministic and increasing operators,
a dilation (respectively an erosion) is an operation which is distributive over supremum (respectively
infimum). From this simple definition of dilation and erosion, we cannot say much about the properties
of them. However, when they form an adjunction, many important properties can be derived such as
monotonicity, idempotence, and extensivity or anti-extensivity of their composition, preservation
of infimum and supremum, etc. Mathematical morphology has been first developed in the setting of
sets, and then extended to other algebraic structures such as graphs, hypergraphs or simplicial
complexes. For all these algebraic structures, erosion and dilation are usually based on structuring
elements. The goal is then to match these structuring elements on given objects either to dilate
or erode them. One of the advantages of defining erosion and dilation based on structuring elements
is that these operations are adjoint. Based on this observation, this paper proposes to define,
at the abstract level of category theory, erosion and dilation based on structuring elements. We
then define the notion of morpho-category on which erosion and dilation are defined. We then show
that topos and more precisely topos of presheaves are good candidates to generate morpho-categories.
However, topos do not allow taking into account the notion of inclusion between substructures but
rather are defined by monics up to domain isomorphism. Therefore we define the notion of morpholizable
category which allows generating morpho-categories where substructures are defined along inclusion
morphisms. {A direct application of this framework is to generalize modal morpho-logic to other
algebraic structures than simple sets.
