Many biological, social, and communication systems can be modeled by ``searchers'' moving through
a complex network. For example, intracellular cargo is transported on tubular networks, news and
rumors spread through online social networks, and the rapid global spread of infectious diseases
occurs through passengers traveling on the airport network. To understand the timescale of search/transport/spread,
one commonly studies the first passage time (FPT) of a single searcher (or ``spreader'') to a target.
However, in many scenarios the relevant timescale is not the FPT of a single searcher to a target,
but rather the FPT of the fastest searcher to a target out of many searchers. For example, many processes
in cell biology are triggered by the first molecule to find a target out of many, and the time it takes
an infectious disease to reach a particular city depends on the first infected traveler to arrive
out of potentially many infected travelers. Such fastest FPTs are called extreme FPTs. In this paper,
we study extreme FPTs for a general class of continuous-time random walks on networks (which includes
continuous-time Markov chains). In the limit of many searchers, we find explicit formulas for the
probability distribution and all the moments of the $k$th fastest FPT. These rigorous formulas
depend only on network parameters along a certain geodesic path(s) from the starting location to
the target since the fastest searchers take a direct route to the target. Furthermore, our results
allow one to estimate if a particular system is in a regime characterized by fast extreme FPTs. We
also prove similar results for mortal searchers on a network that are conditioned to find the target
before a fast inactivation time. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations and uncover
potential pitfalls of modeling diffusive or subdiffusive processes involving extreme statistics.
