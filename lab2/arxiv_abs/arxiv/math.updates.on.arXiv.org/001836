This paper concerns the relation between the quantum toroidal algebras and the affine Yangians
of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, denoted by $\mathcal{U}^{(n)}_{q_1,q_2,q_3}$ and $\mathcal{Y}^{(n)}_{h_1,h_2,h_3}$,
respectively. Our motivation arises from the milestone work of Gautam and Toledano Laredo, where
a similar relation between the quantum loop algebra $U_q(L \mathfrak{g})$ and the Yangian $Y_h(\mathfrak{g})$
has been established by constructing an isomorphism of $\mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$-algebras $\Phi:\widehat{U}_{\exp(\hbar)}(L\mathfrak{g})\to
\widehat{Y}_\hbar(\mathfrak{g})$ (with $\ \widehat{}\ $ standing for the appropriate completions).
These two completions model the behavior of the algebras in the formal neighborhood of $h=0$. The
same construction can be applied to the toroidal setting with $q_i=\exp(\hbar_i)$ for $i=1,2,3$.
In the current paper, we are interested in the more general relation: $\mathrm{q}_1=\omega_{mn}e^{h_1/m},
\mathrm{q}_2=e^{h_2/m}, \mathrm{q}_3=\omega_{mn}^{-1}e^{h_3/m}$, where $m,n\in \mathbb{N}$
and $\omega_{mn}$ is an $mn$-th root of $1$. Assuming $\omega_{mn}^m$ is a primitive $n$-th root
of unity, we construct a homomorphism $\Phi^{\omega_{mn}}_{m,n}$ from the completion of the formal
version of $\mathcal{U}^{(m)}_{\mathrm{q}_1,\mathrm{q}_2,\mathrm{q}_3}$ to the completion
of the formal version of $\mathcal{Y}^{(mn)}_{h_1/mn,h_2/mn,h_3/mn}$. We propose two proofs
of this result: (1) by constructing the compatible isomorphism between the faithful representations
of the algebras; (2) by combining the direct verification of Gautam and Toledano Laredo for the classical
setting with the shuffle approach.
