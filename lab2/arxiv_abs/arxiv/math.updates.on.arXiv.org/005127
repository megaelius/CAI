Markov decision processes (MDPs) are widely used to model stochastic systems in many applications.
Several efficient algorithms including value iteration (VI), policy iteration and LP-based algorithms
have been studied in the literature to compute optimal policies for MDPs. However, these do not scale
well especially when the discount factor for the infinite horizon reward, $\lambda$, gets close
to one, which is the case in many applications. In particular, the running time scales as $1/(1-\lambda)$
for these algorithms. In this paper, we present faster algorithms that empirically significantly
outperform the current approaches. Our approach builds upon the connection between VI and \textit{gradient
descent} and adapts the ideas of \textit{acceleration} in smooth convex optimization to design
faster algorithms for MDPs. The improvement in running time is analogous to Nesterov's acceleration
in smooth convex optimization, even though our function (Bellman operator) is neither smooth nor
convex. We study the empirical performance of our algorithm and observe that in random and Garnet
MDP instances, it provides significant speedup (up to one order of magnitude in many cases) compared
to current approaches. We provide insights on our faster algorithm, showing that it is a composition
of affine maps (possibly different in each iteration). Finally, we provide a lower-bound on the
convergence properties of any first-order algorithm for solving MDP. In particular, we present
a family of MDP instances for which no algorithm can converge faster than VI when the number of iterations
is smaller than the number of states.
