We investigate the local and global optimality of the triangular, square, simple cubic, face-centred-cubic
(FCC), body-centred-cubic (BCC) lattices and the hexagonal-close-packing (HCP) structure for
a potential energy per point generated by a Morse potential with parameters $(\alpha,r_0)$. The
optimality of the triangular lattice is proved in dimension 2 in an interval of densities. Furthermore,
a complete numerical investigation is performed for the minimization of the energy with respect
to the density. In dimension 3, the local optimality of the simple cubic, FCC and BCC lattices is numerically
studied. We also show that the square, triangular, cubic, FCC and BCC lattices are the only Bravais
lattices in dimensions 2 and 3 being critical points of a large class of lattice energies (including
the one studied in this paper) in some open intervals of densities, as we observe for the Lennard-Jones
and the Morse potential lattice energies. Finally, we state a conjecture about the global minimizer
for the 3d energy that exhibits a surprising transition from BCC, FCC to HCP as $\alpha$ increases.
Moreover, we compare the values of $\alpha$ found experimentally for metals and rare-gas crystals
with the expected lattice ground-state structure given by our numerical investigation/conjecture.
Only in a few cases does the known ground-state crystal structure match the minimizer we find for
the expected value of $\alpha$. Our conclusion is that the pairwise interaction model with Morse
potential and fixed $\alpha$ is not adapted to describe metals and rare-gas crystals if we want to
take into consideration that the lattice structure we find in nature is the ground-state of the associated
potential energy.
