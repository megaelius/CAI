In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the joint upper and lower tail large deviations
of the edge eigenvalues of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$, in the regime
of $p$ where the edge of the spectrum is no longer governed by global observables, such as the number
of edges, but rather by localized statistics, such as high degree vertices. Going beyond the recent
developments in mean-field approximations of related problems, this paper provides a comprehensive
treatment of the large deviations of the spectral edge in this entire regime, which notably includes
the well studied case of constant average degree. In particular, for $r \geq 1$ fixed, we pin down
the asymptotic probability that the top $r$ eigenvalues are jointly greater/less than their typical
values by multiplicative factors bigger/smaller than $1$, in the regime mentioned above. The proof
for the upper tail relies on a novel structure theorem, obtained by building on estimates of Krivelevich
and Sudakov (2003), followed by an iterative cycle removal process, which shows, conditional on
the upper tail large deviation event, with high probability the graph admits a decomposition in
to a disjoint union of stars and a spectrally negligible part. On the other hand, the key ingredient
in the proof of the lower tail is a Ramsey-type result which shows that if the $K$-th largest degree
of a graph is not atypically small (for some large $K$ depending on $r$), then either the top eigenvalue
or the $r$-th largest eigenvalue is larger than that allowed by the lower tail event on the top $r$
eigenvalues, thus forcing a contradiction. The above arguments reduce the problems to developing
a large deviation theory for the extremal degrees which could be of independent interest.
