We describe a procedure called panel collapse for replacing a CAT(0) cube complex $\Psi$ by a "lower
complexity" CAT(0) cube complex $\Psi_\bullet$ whenever $\Psi$ contains a codimension-$2$ hyperplane
that is extremal in one of the codimension-$1$ hyperplanes containing it. Although $\Psi_\bullet$
is not in general a subcomplex of $\Psi$, it is a subspace consisting of a subcomplex together with
some cubes that sit inside $\Psi$ "diagonally". The hyperplanes of $\Psi_\bullet$ extend to hyperplanes
of $\Psi$. Applying this procedure, we prove: if a group $G$ acts cocompactly on a CAT(0) cube complex
$\Psi$, then there is a CAT(0) cube complex $\Omega$ so that $G$ acts cocompactly on $\Omega$ and
for each hyperplane $H$ of $\Omega$, the stabiliser in $G$ of $H$ acts on $H$ essentially. Using panel
collapse, we obtain a new proof of Stallings's theorem on groups with more than one end. As another
illustrative example, we show that panel collapse applies to the exotic cubulations of free groups
constructed by Wise. Next, we show that the CAT(0) cube complexes constructed by Cashen-Macura
can be collapsed to trees while preserving all of the necessary group actions. (It also illustrates
that our result applies to actions of some non-discrete groups.) We also discuss possible applications
to quasi-isometric rigidity for certain classes of graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups.
Panel collapse is also used in forthcoming work of the first-named author and Wilton to study fixed-point
sets of finite subgroups of $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ on the free splitting complex. Finally, we apply
panel collapse to a conjecture of Kropholler, obtaining a short proof under a natural extra hypothesis.
