The understanding and prediction of sudden changes in flow patterns is of paramount importance
in the analysis of geophysical flows as these rare events relate to critical phenomena such as atmospheric
blocking, the weakening of the Gulf stream, or the splitting of the polar vortex. In this work our
aim is to develop first steps towards a theoretical understanding of vortex splitting phenomena.
To this end, we study bifurcations of global flow patterns in parameter-dependent two-dimensional
incompressible flows, with the flow patterns of interest corresponding to specific invariant
sets. Under small random perturbations these sets become almost-invariant and can be computed
and studied by means of a set-oriented approach, where the underlying dynamics is described in terms
of a reversible finite-state Markov chain. Almost-invariant sets are obtained from the sign structure
of leading eigenvectors of the corresponding transition matrix. By a flow pattern bifurcation
we mean a qualitative change in the form of a break-up of an almost-invariant set, when a critical
external parameter of the underlying dynamical system is reached. For different examples and settings
we follow the spectrum and the corresponding eigenvectors under continuous changes of the underlying
system and yield indicators for different bifurcation scenarios for almost-invariant sets. In
particular, we study a Duffing-type oscillator, which is known to undergo a classic pitchfork bifurcation.
We find that the set-oriented analogue of this classical bifurcation includes a splitting of a rotating
pattern, which has generic precursor signal that can be deduced from the behavior of the spectrum.
