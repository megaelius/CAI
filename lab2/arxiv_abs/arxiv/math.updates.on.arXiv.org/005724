Host-parasitoid population dynamics is often probed using a semi-discrete/hybrid modeling framework.
Here, the update functions in the discrete-time model connecting year-to-year changes in the population
densities are obtained by solving ordinary differential equations that mechanistically describe
interactions when hosts become vulnerable to parasitoid attacks. We use this semi-discrete formalism
to study two key spatial effects: local movement (migration) of parasitoids between patches during
the vulnerable period; and yearly redistribution of populations across patches outside the vulnerable
period. Our results show that in the absence of any redistribution, constant density-independent
migration and parasitoid attack rates are unable to stabilize an otherwise unstable host-parasitoid
population dynamics. Interestingly, inclusion of host redistribution (but not parasitoid redistribution)
before the start of the vulnerable period can lead to stable coexistence of both species. Next, we
consider a Type-III functional response (parasitoid attack rate increases with host density),
where the absence of any spatial effects leads to a neutrally stable host-parasitoid equilibrium.
As before, density-independent parasitoid migration by itself is again insufficient to stabilize
the population dynamics and host redistribution provides a stabilizing influence. Finally, we
show that a Type-III functional response combined with density-dependent parasitoid migration
leads to stable coexistence, even in the absence of population redistributions. In summary, we
have systematically characterized parameter regimes leading to stable/unstable population
dynamics with different forms of spatial heterogeneity coupled to the parasitoid's functional
response using mechanistically formulated semi-discrete models.
