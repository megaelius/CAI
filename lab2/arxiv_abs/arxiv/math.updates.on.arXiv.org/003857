We formulate the generalized Sarnak's M\"obius disjointness conjecture for an arbitrary number
field $K$, and prove a quantitative disjointness result between polynomial nilsequences $(\Phi(g(n)\Gamma))_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^{D}}$
and aperiodic multiplicative functions on $\mathcal{O}_{K}$, the ring of integers of $K$. Here
$D=[K\colon\mathbb{Q}]$, $X=G/\Gamma$ is a nilmanifold, $g\colon\mathbb{Z}^{D}\to G$ is a
polynomial sequence, and $\Phi\colon X\to \mathbb{C}$ is a Lipschitz function. The proof uses
tools from multi-dimensional higher order Fourier analysis, multi-linear analysis, orbit properties
on nilmanifold, and an orthogonality criterion of K\'atai in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$. We also use variations
of this result to derive applications in number theory and combinatorics: (1) we prove a structure
theorem for multiplicative functions on $K$, saying that every bounded multiplicative function
can be decomposed into the sum of an almost periodic function (the structural part) and a function
with small Gowers uniformity norm of any degree (the uniform part); (2) we give a necessary and sufficient
condition for the Gowers norms of a bounded multiplicative function in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ to be
zero; (3) we provide partition regularity results over $K$ for a large class of homogeneous equations
in three variables. For example, for $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}$, we show that for every
partition of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ into finitely many cells, where $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a},\sqrt{b},\sqrt{a+b})$,
there exist distinct and non-zero $x,y$ belonging to the same cell and $z\in\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such
that $ax^{2}+by^{2}=z^{2}$.
