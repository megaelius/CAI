Fourier Transform Interferometry (FTI) is an appealing Hyperspectral (HS) imaging modality for
many applications demanding high spectral resolution, e.g., in fluorescence microscopy. However,
the effective resolution of FTI is limited by the durability of biological elements when exposed
to illuminating light. Overexposed elements are subject to photo-bleaching and become unable
to fluoresce. In this context, the acquisition of biological HS volumes based on sampling the Optical
Path Difference (OPD) axis at Nyquist rate leads to unpleasant trade-offs between spectral resolution,
quality of the HS volume, and light exposure intensity. We propose two variants of the FTI imager,
i.e., Coded Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI) and Structured Illumination FTI (SI-FTI), based on the
theory of compressive sensing (CS). These schemes efficiently modulate light exposure temporally
(in CI-FTI) or spatiotemporally (in SI-FTI). Leveraging a variable density sampling strategy
recently introduced in CS, we provide near-optimal illumination strategies, so that the light
exposure imposed on a biological specimen is minimized while the spectral resolution is preserved.
Our analysis focuses on two criteria: (i) a trade-off between exposure intensity and the quality
of the reconstructed HS volume for a given spectral resolution; (ii) maximizing HS volume quality
for a fixed spectral resolution and constrained exposure budget. Our contributions can be adapted
to an FTI imager without hardware modifications. The reconstruction of HS volumes from CS-FTI measurements
relies on an $l_1$-norm minimization problem promoting a spatiospectral sparsity prior. Numerically,
we support the proposed methods on synthetic data and simulated CS measurements (from actual FTI
measurements) under various scenarios. In particular, the biological HS volumes can be reconstructed
with a three-to-ten-fold reduction in the light exposure.
