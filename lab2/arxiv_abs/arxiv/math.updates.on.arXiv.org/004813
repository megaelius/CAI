The constrained multi-agent optimization problem of distributed resource allocation is addressed
using the evolutionary game theoretic framework. The issue of building temperature control is
analyzed in which the controller is to devise a scheme to distribute available scarce power to every
room to regulate their temperature as per the comfort of user in the best possible manner. The paper
correlates the global constraint of fixed resource amount with the constant population size. The
respective population game is evaluated by means of a dynamical model of the evolutionary game theory
to find the necessary control action. The robustness of optimal solution with respect to minor fluctuations
in the temperature distribution is characterized using evolutionary stable strategy ( ESS ). Along
with the global constraint, the problem formulation constitutes local constraint over an individual
control unit located in every room. The classical dynamical models of evolutionary game theory
such as replicator dynamics, logit dynamics, etc. fail to incorporate respective constraints.
With the escort evolutionary dynamical (ED) model it is possible to address these local constraints
through the concept of the intersection of simplices. However, evaluation of these classical dynamics
along with ED is driven by expected payoff obtained by the overall population, which renders a centralized
implementation approach. To mitigate this central dependency a distributed version of the ED model
referred to as distributed escort dynamics (DED) is proposed. The control action devised adopting
DED approach is shown to provide smooth trajectory tracking along with the low start-up transience
when compared with distributed interior point (DIP) method.
