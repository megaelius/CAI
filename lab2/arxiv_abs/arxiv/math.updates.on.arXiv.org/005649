This work proposes a unifying probabilistic framework for the design of robustly asymptotically
stable moving-horizon estimators (MHE) for discrete-time nonlinear systems, and a mechanism
to incorporate differential privacy in moving-horizon estimation. We begin with an investigation
of the classical notion of strong local observability of nonlinear systems and its relationship
to optimization-based state estimation. We then present a general moving-horizon estimation
framework for strongly locally observable systems, as an iterative minimization scheme in the
space of probability measures. This framework allows for the minimization of the estimation cost
with respect to different metrics. In particular, we consider two variants, which we name $W_2$-MHE
and KL-MHE, where the minimization scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence,
respectively. The $W_2$-MHE yields a gradient-based estimator whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle
filter, for which we investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties. Stability results
for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in the probabilistic setting, against the backdrop
of the classical notion of strong local observability which, to the best of our knowledge, differentiates
it from other previous works. We then propose a mechanism to encode differential privacy of the measurements
used by the estimator via an entropy regularization of the MHE objective functional. In particular,
we find sufficient bounds on the regularization parameter to achieve the desired level of differential
privacy. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of these estimators.
