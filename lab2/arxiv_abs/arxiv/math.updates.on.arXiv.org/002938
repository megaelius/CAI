In an attempt to understand the origins and the nature of the law binding together two group operations
into a {\em skew brace}, introduced in [L.\ Guarnieri \& L.\ Vendramin, Math.\ Comp.\ \textbf{86}
(2017), 2519--2534] as a non-Abelian version of the {\em brace distributive law} of [W.\ Rump, J.\
Algebra {\bf 307} (2007), 153--170] and [F.\ Ced\'o, E.\ Jespers \& J.\ Okni\'nski, Commun.\ Math.\
Phys.\ {\bf 327} (2014), 101--116], the notion of a {\em skew truss} is proposed. A skew truss consists
of a set with a group operation and a semigroup operation connected by a modified distributive law
that interpolates between that of a ring and a brace. It is shown that a particular action and a cocycle
characteristic of skew braces are already present in a skew truss; in fact the interpolating function
is a 1-cocycle, the bijecitivity of which indicates the existence of an operation that turns a truss
into a brace. Furthermore, if the group structure in a two-sided truss is Abelian, then there is an
associated ring -- another feature characteristic of a two-sided brace. To characterise a morphism
of trusses, a {\em pith} is defined as a particular subset of the domain consisting of subsets termed
{\em chambers}, which contains the kernel of the morphism as a group homomorphism. In the case of
both rings and braces piths coincide with kernels. In general the pith of a morphism is a sub-semigroup
of the domain and, if additional properties are satisfied, a pith is a $\mathbb{N}_+$-graded semigroup.
Finally, giving heed to [I.\ Angiono, C.\ Galindo \& L.\ Vendramin, Proc.\ Amer.\ Math.\ Soc.\ {\bf
145} (2017), 1981--1995] we linearise trusses and thus define {\em Hopf trusses} and study their
properties, from which, in parallel to the set-theoretic case, some properties of Hopf braces are
shown to follow.
