In 2013, Gau and Wu introduced a unitary invariant, denoted by $k(A)$, of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$,
which counts the maximal number of orthonormal vectors $\textbf x_j$ such that the scalar products
$\langle A\textbf x_j,\textbf x_j\rangle$ lie on the boundary of the numerical range $W(A)$. We
refer to $k(A)$ as the Gau--Wu number of the matrix $A$. In this paper we take an algebraic geometric
approach and consider the effect of the singularities of the base curve, whose dual is the boundary
generating curve, to classify $k(A)$. This continues the work of Wang and Wu classifying the Gau-Wu
numbers for $3\times 3$ matrices. Our focus on singularities is inspired by Chien and Nakazato,
who classified $W(A)$ for $4\times 4$ unitarily irreducible $A$ with irreducible base curve according
to singularities of that curve. When $A$ is a unitarily irreducible $n\times n$ matrix, we give necessary
conditions for $k(A) = 2$, characterize $k(A) = n$, and apply these results to the case of unitarily
irreducible $4\times 4$ matrices. However, we show that knowledge of the singularities is not sufficient
to determine $k(A)$ by giving examples of unitarily irreducible matrices whose base curves have
the same types of singularities but different $k(A)$. In addition, we extend Chien and Nakazato's
classification to consider unitarily irreducible $A$ with reducible base curve and show that we
can find corresponding matrices with identical base curve but different $k(A)$. Finally, we use
the recently-proved Lax Conjecture to give a new proof of a theorem of Helton and Spitkovsky, generalizing
their result in the process.
