Consider a family of Hamiltonians $H_0^\Lambda$ for systems of interacting fermions on finite
subsets $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$ of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that has a spectral gap above
the ground state uniformly in the system size $|\Lambda|$. We show that for a large class of perturbations
$V$ there exist non-equilibrium almost-stationary states (NEASS) for the perturbed Hamiltonian
$H=H_0+V_\varepsilon$, even if the perturbation closes the spectral gap. Almost-stationarity
refers to the property that expectations of intensive quantities in these states are constant over
long (super-polynomial in $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$) times up to small (super-polynomial in $\varepsilon$)
errors, uniformly in the size $|\Lambda|$ of the system. These NEASS are connected to the ground
state of the unperturbed Hamiltonian by quasi-local unitary transformations. The class of allowed
perturbations $V_\varepsilon$ includes slowly varying potentials and small quasi-local perturbations.
Both types of perturbations need not be small in norm. Slowly varying potentials typically close
the gap of $H_0$, but leave a local gap structure intact. We also prove an adiabatic-type theorem
for time-dependent NEASS associated with time-dependent perturbations. Based on this theorem,
we show that when starting from the ground state of the unperturbed gapped system and then adiabatically
turning on the perturbation (which might close the gap), then the final state of the corresponding
Schr\"odinger evolution is given by a NEASS up to errors that are asymptotically smaller than any
power of the adiabatic parameter. The NEASS that is finally reached is independent of the precise
form of the switching function.
