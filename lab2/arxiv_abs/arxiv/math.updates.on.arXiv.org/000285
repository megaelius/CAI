We consider a planar robot arm with $n$ segments of lengths $l_{n-1}, l_{n-2}, ..., l_1, l_0$. It
is well-known [Jaggi, 92; Kapovich and Millson, 94] that for some values of the base-length, $z$
(i.e., length of line joining the base of the arm with its end-effector), the configuration space
of the constrained arm (arm with its end effector fixed) has two disconnected components, while
for other values it has one connected component. We first review some of these known results relating
the value of $z$ with the connectivity of the constrained configuration space with end-effector
fixed. Then the main contribution of this paper is the design of pairs of continuous inverse kinematics
with the property that the two inverse kinematics agree (i.e., return the same configuration) when
the said constrained configuration space of the end-effector-fixed arm has a single connected
component, but they give distinct configurations -- one in each of the connected components -- when
the configuration space of the constrained arm has two components. In order to achieve this we describe
a general inverse kinematics algorithm as a continuous map from $\mathbb{R}_+$ (the space of base-lengths)
to the space of configurations. We then design the pairs of continuous inverse kinematics such that
they pass through certain critical points of the base-length function (called the "vital critical
points" -- critical points at which the connectivity of the configuration space of the constrained
arm changes). We demonstrate the simplicity of the presented algorithm through a Javascript + HTML5
based implementation available at this http URL .
