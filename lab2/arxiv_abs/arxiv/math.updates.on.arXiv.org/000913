The structure signature of a system made up of $n$ components having continuous and i.i.d. lifetimes
was defined in the eighties by Samaniego as the $n$-tuple whose $k$-th coordinate is the probability
that the $k$-th component failure causes the system to fail. More recently, a bivariate version
of this concept was considered as follows. The joint structure signature of a pair of systems built
on a common set of components having continuous and i.i.d. lifetimes is a square matrix of order $n$
whose $(k,l)$-entry is the probability that the $k$-th failure causes the first system to fail and
the $l$-th failure causes the second system to fail. This concept was successfully used to derive
a signature-based decomposition of the joint reliability of the two systems. In the first part of
this paper we provide an explicit formula to compute the joint structure signature of two or more
systems and extend this formula to the general non-i.i.d. case, assuming only that the distribution
of the component lifetimes has no ties. We also provide and discuss a necessary and sufficient condition
on this distribution for the joint reliability of the systems to have a signature-based decomposition.
In the second part of this paper we show how our results can be efficiently applied to the investigation
of the reliability and signature of multistate systems made up of two-state components. The key
observation is that the structure function of such a multistate system can always be additively
decomposed into a sum of classical structure functions. Considering a multistate system then reduces
to considering simultaneously several two-state systems.
