We develop links between harmonic analysis, the geometry of numbers and random matrix theory in
the setting of complex and quaternion vectors spaces. Harmonic analysis enters through the computation
of volumes --- done using the Selberg integral --- of truncations of SL${}_N(\mathbb C)$ and SL${}_N(\mathbb
H)$ endowed with invariant measure, which have applications to asymptotic counting formulas,
for example of matrices in SL${}_2(\mathbb Z[i])$. The geometry of numbers enters through imposing
an invariant measure on the space of unimodular lattices, the latter constructed using certain
complex quadratic integers (complex case) and the Hurwitz integers (quaternion case). We take
up the problem of applying lattice reduction in this setting, in two dimensions, giving a unified
proof of convergence of the appropriate analogue of the Lagrange--Gauss algorithm to the shortest
basis. A decomposition of measure corresponding to the QR decomposition is used to specify the invariant
measure in the coordinates of the shortest basis vectors, which also encodes the specification
of fundamental domains of certain quotient spaces. Integration over the latter gives rise to certain
number theoretic constants, which are also present in the asymptotic forms of the distribution
of the lengths of the shortest basis vectors, which we compute explicitly. Siegel's mean value theorem
can be used to reclaim these same arithmetic constants. Numerical implementation of the Lagrange--Gauss
algorithm allows for statistics relating to the shortest basis to be generated by simulation. Excellent
agreement with the theory is obtained in all cases.
