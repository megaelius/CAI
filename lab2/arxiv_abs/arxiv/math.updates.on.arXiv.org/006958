In this paper, the problem of optimizing the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped
with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs
can predict the illumination distribution of a given service area and determine the user association
with the UAVs to simultaneously provide communications and illumination. However, ambient illumination
increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the UAVs.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target area for UAV
deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which jointly
optimizes UAV deployment, user association, and power efficiency while meeting the illumination
and communication requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the
machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) is proposed. Using GRUs and CNNs, the UAVs can model the long-term historical illumination
distribution and predict the future illumination distribution. Based on the prediction of illumination
distribution, the optimization problem becomes nonconvex and is then solved using a low-complexity,
iterative physical relaxation algorithm. The proposed algorithm can find the optimal UAV deployment
and user association to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results using real data from
the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to
64.6% reduction in total transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that
does not consider the illumination distribution and user association. The results also show that
UAVs must hover at areas having strong illumination, thus providing useful guidelines on the deployment
of VLC-enabled UAVs.
