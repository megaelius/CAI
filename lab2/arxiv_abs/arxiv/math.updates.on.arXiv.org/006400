We present applications of contramodule techniques to the Enochs conjecture about covers and direct
limits, both in the categorical tilting context and beyond. In the $n$-tilting-cotilting correspondence
situation, if $\mathsf A$ is a Grothendieck abelian category and the related abelian category $\mathsf
B$ is equivalent to the category of contramodules over a topological ring $\mathfrak R$ belonging
to one of certain four classes of topological rings (e.g., $\mathfrak R$ is commutative), then the
left tilting class is covering in $\mathsf A$ if and only if it is closed under direct limits in $\mathsf
A$, and if and only if all the discrete quotient rings of the topological ring $\mathfrak R$ are perfect.
More generally, if $M$ is a module satisfying a certain telescope Hom exactness condition (e.g.,
$M$ is $\Sigma$-pure-$\operatorname{Ext}^1$-self-orthogonal) and the topological ring $\mathfrak
R$ of endomorphisms of $M$ belongs to one of certain seven classes of topological rings, then the
class $\mathsf{Add}(M)$ is closed under direct limits if and only if every countable direct limit
of copies of $M$ has an $\mathsf{Add}(M)$-cover, and if and only if $M$ has perfect decomposition.
In full generality, for an additive category $\mathsf A$ with (co)kernels and a precovering class
$\mathsf L\subset\mathsf A$ closed under summands, an object $N\in\mathsf A$ has an $\mathsf L$-cover
if and only if a certain object $\Psi(N)$ in an abelian category $\mathsf B$ with enough projectives
has a projective cover. The $1$-tilting modules and objects arising from injective ring epimorphisms
of projective dimension $1$ form a class of examples which we discuss.
