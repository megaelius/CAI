The aim of this note is to prove various general properties of a generalization of a Lie-Rinehart
algebra - a $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra. A $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra $\tilde{L}$ is
a Lie-Rinehart algebra over $A/k$ equipped with an $A\otimes_k A$-module structure that is compatible
with the Lie-structure. Given a $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra $(\tilde{L},\alpha, \pi,[,],D)$
and a connection $\rho:\tilde{L} \rightarrow \operatorname{End}_k(E)$ we construct the tensor
algebra $\operatorname{T}^*_B(\tilde{L})$ of $\tilde{L}$. We use the tensor algebra $\operatorname{T}^*_B(\tilde{L})$
to construct the cohomology $\operatorname{H}^i(\tilde{L},(E,\rho))$ and homology $\operatorname{H}_i(\tilde{L},(E,\rho))$
of any $\tilde{L}$-connection $(E,\rho)$. The classical $A/k$-Lie-Rinehart cohomology $\operatorname{H}^i(L,(E,\nabla))$
of a flat connection $(E,\nabla)$ on a Lie-Rinehart algebra $(L,\alpha)$ is a $k$-module in general.
Using the tensor algebra $\operatorname{T}^*_B(\tilde{L})$ we get an $A\otimes_k A$-module
structure on the cohomology and homology of a connection $(E,\rho)$, hence using this more general
construction we get more structure on the cohomology and homology of a connection. Given an arbitrary
connection $(E,\rho)$ we construct the universal ring $\operatorname{U}(\tilde{L},\rho)$
of $(E,\rho)$ and in the case when $A$ is Noetherian and $\tilde{L},E$ finitely generated $A$-modules
it follows $\operatorname{U}(\tilde{L},\rho)$ is an almost commutative Noetherian subring
of $\operatorname{Diff}(E)$. The ring is defined for an arbitrary connection $\rho$ and one may
use $\operatorname{U}(\tilde{L},\rho)$ to define the characteristic variety of $(E,\rho)$
and holonomiticy for non-flat connections. This construction was previously available for flat
connections.
