We use a Schr\"odinger wave equation formalism to solve the eikonal equation. We show that a solution
to the eikonal equation is obtained in the limit as Planck's constant $\hbar$ (treated as a free parameter)
tends to zero of the solution to the corresponding linear Schr\"odinger equation. The Schr\"odinger
equation corresponding to the eikonal turns out to be a generalized, screened Poisson equation.
Despite being linear, it does not have a closed-form solution for arbitrary forcing functions.
We use a standard perturbation analysis approach to derive a new algorithm which is guaranteed to
converge provided the forcing function is bounded and positive. The perturbation technique requires
a sequence of discrete convolutions which can be performed in $O(N \log N)$ using the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) where $N$ is the number of grid points. For the Euclidean distance function problem---a
special case of the eikonal equation where the forcing function is everywhere identically equal
to one---a major advantage of our approach over most other methods is that we do not require a spatial
discretization of gradient operators and this contributes to the increased accuracy of our technique.
The solution to the eikonal solution is recovered from the exponent of the wave function. Since the
wave function is computed for a small but non-zero $\hbar$, the obtained solution is an approximation.
We provide evidence for the usefulness of our technique by comparing the results of our approach
with those obtained from popular Hamilton-Jacobi solvers such as the fast sweeping algorithm as
well as with exact solutions (when available). The latter can be easily computed for the Euclidean
distance function problem.
