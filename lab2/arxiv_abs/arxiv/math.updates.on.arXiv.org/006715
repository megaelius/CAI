In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of "cyclic stratum" of a Frobenius manifold
$M$. This is the set of points of the extended manifold $\mathbb C^*\times M$ at which the unit vector
field is a cyclic vector for the isomonodromic system defined by the flatness condition of the extended
deformed connection. The study of the geometry of the complement of the cyclic stratum is addressed.
We show that at points of the cyclic stratum, the isomonodromic system attached to $M$ can be reduced
to a scalar differential equation, called the "master differential equation" of $M$. In the case
of Frobenius manifolds coming from Gromov-Witten theory, namely quantum cohomologies of smooth
projective varieties, such a construction reproduces the notion of quantum differential equation.
In the second part of the paper, we introduce two multilinear transforms, called "Borel-Laplace
$(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms", on spaces of Ribenboim formal
power series with exponents and coefficients in an arbitrary finite dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra
$A$. When $A$ is specialized to the cohomology of smooth projective varieties, the integral forms
of the Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms are used in
order to rephrase the Quantum Lefschetz Theorem. This leads to explicit Mellin-Barnes integral
representations of solutions of the quantum differential equations for a wide class of smooth projective
varieties, including Fano complete intersections in projective spaces. In the third and final
part of the paper, as an application, we show how to use the new analytic tools, introduced in the previous
parts, in order to study the quantum differential equations of Hirzebruch surfaces. This finally
leads to the proof of Dubrovin Conjecture for all Hirzebruch surfaces.
