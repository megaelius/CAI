In this work we propose an Uncertainty Quantification methodology for sedimentary basins evolution
under mechanical and geochemical compaction processes, which we model as a coupled, time-dependent,
non-linear, monodimensional (depth-only) system of PDEs with uncertain parameters. While in
previous works (Formaggia et al. 2013, Porta et al., 2014) we assumed a simplified depositional
history with only one material, in this work we consider multi-layered basins, in which each layer
is characterized by a different material, and hence by different properties. This setting requires
several improvements with respect to our earlier works, both concerning the deterministic solver
and the stochastic discretization. On the deterministic side, we replace the previous fixed-point
iterative solver with a more efficient Newton solver at each step of the time-discretization. On
the stochastic side, the multi-layered structure gives rise to discontinuities in the dependence
of the state variables on the uncertain parameters, that need an appropriate treatment for surrogate
modeling techniques, such as sparse grids, to be effective. We propose an innovative methodology
to this end which relies on a change of coordinate system to align the discontinuities of the target
function within the random parameter space. The reference coordinate system is built upon exploiting
physical features of the problem at hand. We employ the locations of material interfaces, which
display a smooth dependence on the random parameters and are therefore amenable to sparse grid polynomial
approximations. We showcase the capabilities of our numerical methodologies through two synthetic
test cases. In particular, we show that our methodology reproduces with high accuracy multi-modal
probability density functions displayed by target state variables (e.g., porosity).
