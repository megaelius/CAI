This book discusses the construction of triangulated categories of mixed motives over a noetherian
scheme of finite dimension, extending Voevodsky's definition of motives over a field. In particular,
it is shown that motives with rational coefficients satisfy the formalism of the six operations
of Grothendieck. This is achieved by studying descent properties of motives, as well as by comparing
different presentations of these categories, following and extending insights and constructions
of Deligne, Beilinson, Bloch, Thomason, Gabber, Levine, Morel, Voevodsky, Ayoub, Spitzweck,
R\"ondigs, {\O}stv{\ae}r, and others. In particular, the relation of motives with $K$-theory
is addressed in full, and we prove the absolute purity theorem with rational coefficients, using
Quillen's localization theorem in algebraic $K$-theory together with a variation on the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch
theorem. Using resolution of singularities via alterations of de Jong-Gabber, this leads to a version
of Grothendieck-Verdier duality for constructible motivic sheaves with rational coefficients
over rather general base schemes. We also study versions with integral coefficients, constructed
via sheaves with transfers, for which we obtain partial results. Finally, we associate to any mixed
Weil cohomology a system of categories of coefficients and well behaved realization functors,
establishing a correspondence between mixed Weil cohomologies and suitable systems of coefficients.
The results of this book have already served as ground reference in many subsequent works on motivic
sheaves and their realizations, and pointers to the most recent developments of the theory are given
in the introduction.
