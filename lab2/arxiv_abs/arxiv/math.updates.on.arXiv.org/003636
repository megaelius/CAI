Recent advances in quantifying phenotypic heterogeneity in bacteria have shown its broad prevalence
in nature. However, evaluating the ultimate impact of single-organism heterogeneity at the population
level remains an active area of research in microbiology. We show that the generalized Fibonacci
recurrence \begin{equation}g_n=g_{n-k}+g_{n-m}\tag{GF}\end{equation} provides a simple,
mathematically rigorous and computationally tractable model for heterogeneous bacterial growth.
We examine the impact of small-scale heterogeneity during bacterial division, of the sort observed
due to the asymmetric partitioning of aged molecules. We find that small consistent differences
in growth rates between daughter cells can have ecologically significant population growth rate
benefits and that different models of the cost of heterogeneity may lead to an optimal intermediate
amount of heterogeneity between daughter cells. The mathematical framework generalizes the previous
combinatorial models developed for the division of yeast, inadequate for modeling bacteria due
to the finer control required over the amount of heterogeneity encountered in the latter. Furthermore,
when $k$ and $m$ are relatively prime, by juxtaposing the point of view of binary heterogeneous division
to the original combinatorial perspective on (GF), in terms of diagonals in Pascal's triangle,
we obtain new combinatorial insights. In particular, we obtain an explicit binomial identity for
the sums of elements lying on the diagonals $kx+my=n$ in Pascal's triangle $\mathbb N_0\times \mathbb
N_0\ni(x,y)\mapsto {x+y\choose x}$. This provides a missing piece in the earlier work of Dickinson~\cite{Dickinson1950},
Raab \cite{Raab1963}, and Green \cite{Green1968}.
