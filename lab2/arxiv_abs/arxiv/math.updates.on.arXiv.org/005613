In this paper, we deal with an obstacle placement problem inside a disk, that can be formulated as
an energy minimization problem with respect to the rotations of the obstacle about its center, with
respect to the translations of the obstacle within a planar disk and also with respect to the expansion
or contraction of the obstacle inside the disk. We also include its sensitivity with respect to the
boundary data. We consider an inhomogeneous Dirichlet Boundary Value Problem on $ B \setminus P$
as follows: $\Delta u =0$ on $ B \setminus P$, $u=0$ on $\partial P$, $u=M$, a nonzero constant on $\partial
B$. Here, the planar obstacle $P$ is invariant under the action of a dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_n$,
$n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \geq 3$, and $B$ is a planar disk containing $P$. We make the following assumptions
on $P$ and $B$: (0) the volume constraint on $P$ and $B$ both, (i) invariance of both $B$ and $P$ under
the action of the same dihedral group, (ii) $B$ and $P$ need not be concentric, (iii) smoothness condition
on both the boundaries, (iv) a monotonicity condition on the boundary $\partial P$ of the obstacle
$P$. Examples of such obstacles include regular polygons with smoothened corners, ellipses, among
other star-shaped domains. In this setting, we investigate the extremal configurations of the
obstacle $P$ with respect to the disk $B$, for the energy functional $E$ associated with the boundary
value problem. The Dirichlet energy is the one-constant Oseen-Frank energy of a uniaxial planar
nematic liquid crystal. The class of problems considered here sheds some light into optimal locations
of holes with a certain symmetry inside a nematic-filled disc, so as to optimise the corresponding
one-constant nematic Oseen-Frank energy.
