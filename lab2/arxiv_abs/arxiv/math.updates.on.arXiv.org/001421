Given $I\subset\mathbb{C}$ and an integer $N>0$, a function $f:I\to\mathbb{C}$ is entrywise
positivity preserving on positive semidefinite (p.s.d.) matrices $A=(a_{jk})\in I^{N\times
N}$, if the entrywise application $f[A]=(f(a_{jk}))$ of $f$ to $A$ is p.s.d. for all such $A$. Such
preservers in all dimensions have been classified by Schoenberg (see also Rudin) as being absolutely
monotonic [Duke Math. J. 1942; 1959]. In fixed dimension $N$, results akin to work of Horn and Loewner
[Trans. AMS 1969] show the first $N$ nonzero Maclaurin coefficients of a positivity preserver $f$
are positive; and the last $N$ coefficients are also positive if $I$ is unbounded. However, little
was known about the other coefficients: the only examples to date for unbounded domains $I$ were
absolutely monotonic, so work in all dimensions; and for bounded $I$ examples of non-absolutely
monotonic preservers were very few (and recent). In this paper, we completely characterize the
sign patterns of the Maclaurin coefficients of positivity preservers in fixed dimension $N$, over
bounded and unbounded domains $I=(0,\rho)$. In particular, the above Horn-type conditions cannot
be improved upon. This also yields the first polynomials which preserve positivity on p.s.d. matrices
in $I^{N\times N}$ but not in $I^{(N+1)\times (N+1)}$. We obtain analogous results for real exponents
using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula. We then go from qualitative bounds, which suffice
to deduce all possible sign patterns, to exact quantitative bounds. We also deduce several applications,
including extending a conjecture by Cuttler-Greene-Skandera to a novel characterization of weak
majorization for real tuples. Finally, we show that (a consequence of) a positivity result of Lam-Postnikov-Pylyavskyy
[Amer. J. Math. 2007] is a manifestation of a new log-supermodularity phenomenon for totally positive
matrix determinants.
