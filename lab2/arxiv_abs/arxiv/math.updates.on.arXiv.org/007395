Multi-point vehicular positioning is one essential operation for autonomous vehicles. However,
the state-of-the-art positioning technologies, relying on reflected signals from a target (i.e.,
RADAR and LIDAR), cannot work without line-of-sight. Besides, it takes significant time for environment
scanning and object recognition with potential detection inaccuracy, especially in complex urban
situations. Some recent fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles further expose such limitations.
In this paper, we aim at overcoming these limitations by proposing a novel relative positioning
approach, called Cooperative Multi-point Positioning (COMPOP). The COMPOP establishes cooperation
between a target vehicle (TV) and a sensing vehicle (SV) if a LoS path exists, where a TV explicitly
lets an SV to know the TV's existence by transmitting positioning waveforms. This cooperation makes
it possible to remove the time-consuming scanning and target recognizing processes, facilitating
real-time positioning. One prerequisite for the cooperation is a clock synchronization between
a pair of TV and SV. To this end, we use a phase-differential-of-arrival based approach to remove
the TV-SV clock difference from the received signal. With clock difference correction, the TV's
position can be obtained via peak detection over a 3D power spectrum constructed by a Fourier transform
(FT) based algorithm. The COMPOP also incorporates nearby vehicles, without knowing their locations,
into the above cooperation for the case without a LoS path. The effectiveness of the COMPOP is verified
by several simulations concerning practical channel parameters.
