In this work we are interested in the differential geometry of surfaces in simply isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$
and pseudo-isotropic $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ spaces, which consists in the study of $\mathbb{R}^3$
equipped with a degenerate metric such as $\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2\pm\mathrm{d}y^2$.
The investigation is based on previous results in the simply isotropic space [B. Pavkovi\'c, Glas.
Mat. Ser. III $\mathbf{15}$, 149 (1980); Rad JAZU $\mathbf{450}$, 129 (1990)], which point to the
possibility of introducing an isotropic Gauss map taking values on a unit sphere of parabolic type
and of defining a shape operator from it, whose determinant and trace give the known relative Gaussian
and mean curvatures, respectively. Based on the isotropic Gauss map, a new notion of connection
is also introduced, the $relative$ $connection$ ($r$-$connection$, for short). We show that the
new curvature tensor in both $\mathbb{I}^3$ and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ does not vanish
identically and is directly related to the relative Gaussian curvature. We also compute the Gauss
and Codazzi-Mainardi equations for the $r$-connection and show that $r$-geodesics on spheres
of parabolic type are obtained via intersections with planes passing through their center (focus).
Finally, we show that admissible pseudo-isotropic surfaces are timelike and that their shape operator
may fail to be diagonalizable, in analogy to Lorentzian geometry. We also prove that the only totally
umbilical surfaces in $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ are planes and spheres of parabolic type and
that, in contrast to the $r$-connection, the curvature tensor associated with the isotropic Levi-Civita
connection vanishes identically for $any$ pseudo-isotropic surface, as also happens in simply
isotropic space.
