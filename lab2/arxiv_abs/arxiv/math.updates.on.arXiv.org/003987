This paper is concerned with numerically finding a global solution of constrained optimal control
problems with many local minima. The focus is on the optimal decentralized control (ODC) problem,
whose feasible set is recently shown to have an exponential number of connected components and consequently
an exponential number of local minima. The rich literature of numerical algorithms for nonlinear
optimization suggests that if a local search algorithm is initialized in an arbitrary connected
component of the feasible set, it would search only within that component and find a stationary point
there. This is based on the fact that numerical algorithms are designed to generate a sequence of
points (via searching for descent directions and adjusting the step size), whose corresponding
continuous path is trapped in a single connected component. In contrast with this perception rooted
in convex optimization, we numerically illustrate that local search methods for non-convex constrained
optimization can obliviously jump between different connected components to converge to a global
minimum, via an aggressive step size adjustment using backtracking and the Armijio rule. To support
the observations, we prove that from almost every arbitrary point in any connected component of
the feasible set, it is possible to generate a sequence of points using local search to jump to different
components and converge to a global solution. However, due to the NP-hardness of the problem, such
fine-tuning of the parameters of a local search algorithm may need prior knowledge or be time consuming.
This paper offers the first result on escaping non-global local solutions of constrained optimal
control problems with complicated feasible sets.
