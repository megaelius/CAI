Motivated by mail delivery scheduling problems arising in Royal Mail, we study a generalization
of the fundamental makespan scheduling P||Cmax problem which we call the "bounded job start scheduling
problem". Given a set of jobs, each specified by an integer processing time p_j, that have to be executed
non-preemptively by a set of m parallel identical machines, the objective is to compute a minimum
makespan schedule subject to an upper bound g<=m on the number of jobs that may simultaneously begin
per unit of time. We show that Longest Processing Time First (LPT) algorithm is tightly 2-approximate.
After proving that the problem is strongly NP-hard even when g=1, we elaborate on improving the 2-approximation
ratio for this case. We distinguish the classes of long and short instances satisfying p_j>=m and
p_j<m, respectively, for each job j. We show that LPT is 5/3-approximate for the former and optimal
for the latter. Then, we explore the idea of scheduling long jobs in parallel with short jobs to obtain
tightly satisfied packing and bounded job start constraints. For a broad family of instances excluding
degenerate instances with many very long jobs, we derive a 1.985-approximation ratio. For general
instances, we require machine augmentation to obtain better than 2-approximate schedules. Finally,
we exploit machine augmentation and lexicographic optimization, which is useful for P||Cmax under
uncertainty, to propose a two-stage robust optimization approach for bounded job start scheduling
under uncertainty aiming in good trade-offs in terms of makespan and number of used machines. We
substantiate this approach numerically using Royal Mail data.
