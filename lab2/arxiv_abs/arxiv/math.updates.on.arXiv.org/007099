Special $\alpha$-limit sets ($s\alpha$-limit sets) combine together all accumulation points
of all backward orbit branches of a point $x$ under a noninvertible map. The most important question
about them is whether or not they are closed. We challenge the notion of $s\alpha$-limit sets as backward
attractors for interval maps by showing that they need not be closed. This disproves a conjecture
by Kolyada, Misiurewicz, and Snoha. We give a criterion in terms of Xiong's attracting center that
completely characterizes which interval maps have all $s\alpha$-limit sets closed, and we show
that our criterion is satisfied in the piecewise monotone case. We apply Blokh's models of solenoidal
and basic $\omega$-limit sets to solve four additional conjectures by Kolyada, Misiurewicz, and
Snoha relating topological properties of $s\alpha$-limit sets to the dynamics within them. For
example, we show that the isolated points in a $s\alpha$-limit set of an interval map are always periodic,
the non-degenerate components are the union of one or two transitive cycles of intervals, and the
rest of the $s\alpha$-limit set is nowhere dense. Moreover, we show that $s\alpha$-limit sets in
the interval are always both $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$. Finally, since $s\alpha$-limit sets need
not be closed, we propose a new notion of $\beta$-limit sets to serve as backward attractors. The
$\beta$-limit set of $x$ is the smallest closed set to which all backward orbit branches of $x$ converge,
and it coincides with the closure of the $s\alpha$-limit set. At the end of the paper we suggest several
new problems about backward attractors.
