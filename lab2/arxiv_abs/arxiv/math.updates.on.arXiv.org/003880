The agent-based singular Kuramoto model was proposed in [60] as a singular version of the Kuramoto
model of coupled oscillators that is consistent with Hebb's rule of neuroscience. In such paper,
the authors studied its well-posedness via the concept of Filippov solutions. Interestingly,
they found some new emergent phenomena in the paradigm of Kuramoto model: clustering into subgroups
and emergence of global phase synchronization taking place at finite time. This paper aims at introducing
the associated kinetic singular Kuramoto model along $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}$, that is
reminiscent of the classical Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equation. Our main goal is to propose a well-posedness
theory of measure-valued solutions that remains valid after eventual phase collisions. The results
will depend upon the specific regime of singularity: subcritical, critical and supercritical.
The cornerstone is the existence of Filippov characteristic flows for interaction kernels with
jump discontinuities. Our second goal is to study stability with respect to initial data, that in
particular will provide quantitative estimates for the mean-field limit of the agent-based model
towards the kinetic equation in quadratic Wasserstein-type distances. Finally, we will recover
global phase synchronization at the macroscopic scale under appropriate generic assumptions
on the initial data. The most singular regime will be tackled separately with an alternative method,
namely, a singular hyperbolic limit on a regularized second order model with inertia. Note that
we will work within the manifold $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}$ and will avoid resorting on Euclidean
approximations. Also, no gradient-type structure will be needed, as opposed to some preceding
literature.
