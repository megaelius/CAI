We develop the non-commutative polynomial version of the invariant theory for the quantum general
linear supergroup ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$. A non-commutative ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$-module
superalgebra $\mathcal{P}^{k|l}_{\,r|s}$ is constructed, which is the quantum analogue of the
supersymmetric algebra over $\mathbb{C}^{k|l}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{m|n}\oplus \mathbb{C}^{r|s}\otimes
(\mathbb{C}^{m|n})^{\ast}$. We analyse the structure of the subalgebra of ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$-invariants
in $\mathcal{P}^{k|l}_{\,r|s}$ by using the quantum super analogue of Howe duality. The subalgebra
of ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$-invariants in $\mathcal{P}^{k|l}_{\,r|s}$ is shown
to be finitely generated. We determine its generators and establish a surjective superalgebra
homomorphism from a braided supersymmetric algebra onto it. This establishes the first fundamental
theorem of invariant theory for ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$. We show that the above mentioned
superalgebra homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if $m\geq \min\{k,r\}$ and $n\geq \min\{l,s\}$,
and obtain a monomial basis for the subalgebra of invariants in this case. When the homomorphism
is not injective, we give a representation theoretical description of the generating elements
of the kernel associated to the partition $((m+1)^{n+1})$, producing the second fundamental theorem
of invariant theory for ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$. We consider two applications of
our results. A complete treatment of the non-commutative polynomial version of invariant theory
for ${\rm{ U}}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{m})$ is obtained as the special case with $n=0$, where an explicit
SFT is proved, which we believe to be new. The FFT and SFT of the invariant theory for the general linear
superalgebra are recovered from the classical (i.e., $q\to 1$) limit of our results.
