In this paper, we study the robust linearization of nonlinear poromechanics of unsaturated materials.
The model of interest couples the Richards equation with linear elasticity equations, employing
the equivalent pore pressure. In practice a monolithic solver is not always available, defining
the requirement for a linearization scheme to allow the use of separate simulators, which is not
met by the classical Newton method. We propose three different linearization schemes incorporating
the fixed-stress splitting scheme, coupled with an L-scheme, Modified Picard and Newton linearization
of the flow. All schemes allow the efficient and robust decoupling of mechanics and flow equations.
In particular, the simplest scheme, the Fixed-Stress-L-scheme, employs solely constant diagonal
stabilization, has low cost per iteration, and is very robust. Under mild, physical assumptions,
it is theoretically shown to be a contraction. Due to possible break-down or slow convergence of
all considered splitting schemes, Anderson acceleration is applied as post-processing. Based
on a special case, we justify theoretically the general ability of the Anderson acceleration to
effectively accelerate convergence and stabilize the underlying scheme, allowing even non-contractive
fixed-point iterations to converge. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical indication
of this kind. Theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical results. In particular, Anderson
acceleration has been demonstrated to be very effective for the considered Picard-type methods.
Finally, the Fixed-Stress-Newton scheme combined with Anderson acceleration provides a robust
linearization scheme, meeting the above criteria.
