This work introduces a general framework for constructing high-order, linearly stable, partitioned
solvers for multiphysics problems from a monolithic implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK)
discretization of the semi-discrete equations. The generic multiphysics problem is modeled as
a system of n systems of partial differential equations where the ith subsystem is coupled to the
other subsystems through a coupling term that can depend on the state of all the other subsystems.
This coupled system of partial differential equations reduces to a coupled system of ordinary differential
equations via the method of lines where an appropriate spatial discretization is applied to each
subsystem. The coupled system of ordinary differential equations is taken as a monolithic system
and discretized using an IMEX-RK discretization with a specific implicit-explicit decomposition
that introduces the concept of a predictor for the coupling term. We propose four coupling predictors
that enable the monolithic system to be solved in a partitioned manner and preserve the IMEX-RK structure
and therefore the design order of accuracy of the monolithic scheme. The four partitioned solvers
that result from these predictors are high-order accurate, allow for maximum re-use of existing
single-physics software, and two of the four solvers allow the subsystems to be solved in parallel
at a given stage and time step. We also analyze the stability of a coupled, linear model problem and
show that one of the partitioned solvers achieves unconditional linear stability, while the others
are unconditionally stable only for certain values of the coupling strength. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed partitioned solvers on several classes of multiphysics problems including
a simple linear system of ODEs, advection-diffusion-reaction systems, FSI problems, and particle-laden
flows.
