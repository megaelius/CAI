We study phase space transport in a 2D caldera potential energy surface (PES) using techniques from
nonlinear dynamics. The caldera PES is characterized by a flat region or shallow minimum at its center
surrounded by potential walls and multiple symmetry related index one saddle points that allow
entrance and exit from this intermediate region.We have discovered four qualitatively distinct
cases of the structure of the phase space that govern phase space transport. These cases are categorized
according to the total energy and the stability of the periodic orbits associated with the family
of the central minimum, the bifurcations of the same family, and the energetic accessibility of
the index one saddles. In each case we have computed the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic
orbits of the central region of the potential and the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic
orbits of the families of periodic orbits associated with the index one saddles. We have found that
there are three distinct mechanisms determined by the invariant manifold structure of the unstable
periodic orbits govern the phase space transport. The first mechanism explains the nature of the
entrance of the trajectories from the region of the low energy saddles into the caldera and how they
may become trapped in the central region of the potential. The second mechanism describes the trapping
of the trajectories that begin from the central region of the caldera, their transport to the regions
of the saddles, and the nature of their exit from the caldera. The third mechanism describes the phase
space geometry responsible for the dynamical matching of trajectories originally proposed by
Carpenter and described in Collins et al. (2014) for the two dimensional caldera PES that we consider.
