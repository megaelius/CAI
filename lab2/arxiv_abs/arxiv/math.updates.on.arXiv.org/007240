In reductive proof search, proofs are naturally generalized by solutions, comprising all (possibly
infinite) structures generated by locally correct, bottom-up application of inference rules.
We propose an extension of the Curry-Howard paradigm of representation, from proofs to solutions:
to represent solutions by (possibly infinite) terms of the coinductive variant of the typed lambda-calculus
that represents proofs. On this we build a new, comprehensive approach to proof search; our case
study is proof search in the sequent calculus LJT for intuitionistic implication logic. A second,
finitary representation is proposed, where the lambda-calculus that represents proofs is extended
with a formal greatest fixed point. In the latter system, fixed-point variables enjoy a relaxed
form of binding that allows the detection of cycles through the type system. Formal sums are used
in both representations to express alternatives in the search process, so that not only individual
solutions but actually solution spaces are expressed. Moreover, formal sums are used in the coinductive
syntax to define "decontraction" (contraction bottom-up) - an operation whose theory we initiate
in this paper, and that is used to assign a coinductive lambda-term to each finitary term. The main
result is the existence of an equivalent finitary representation for any given solution space expressed
coinductively. This result underlies an original approach to proof search, where the search builds
the finitary representation of the solution space, and the a posteriori analysis typically consisting
in applying a syntax-directed procedure or function. The paper illustrates the potential of the
methodology to the study of inhabitation problems in the simply-typed lambda-calculus, reviewing
results detailed elsewhere, and including new results that obtain extensive generalizations
of the so-called monatomic theorem.
