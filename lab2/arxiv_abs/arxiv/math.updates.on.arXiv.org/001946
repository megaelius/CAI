We consider the evolution of a decaying passive scalar in the presence of a gaussian white noise fluctuating
linear shear flow known as the Majda Model. We focus on deterministic initial data and establish
the symmetry properties of the evolving point wise probability measure for the random scalar. We
identify, for both point line source initial data, regions in the x-y plane outside of which the PDF
skewness is sign definite for all time, while inside these regions we observe multiple sign changes
corresponding to exchanges in symmetry between hot and cold leaning states using exact representation
formula for the PDF at the origin, and away from the origin, using numerical evaluation of the exact
available Mehler kernels for the scalars statistical moments. A new, rapidly convergent Monte-Carlo
method is developed, dubbed Direct Monte-Carlo (DMC), using the random Green's functions allowing
for the fast construction of the PDF for single point statistics, and multi-point statistics natural
for full Monte-Carlo simulations of the underlying stochastic differential equations (FMC).
This new method demonstrates the full evolution of the PDF from short times, to its long time, limiting
and collapsing universal distribution at arbitrary points in the plane. Further, this method provides
a strong benchmark for FMC and we document numbers of field realization criteria for the FMC to faithfully
compute this complete dynamics. Armed with this benchmark, we apply the FMC to a channel with a no-flux
boundary condition enforced on a channel and observe a dramatically different long time state resulting
from the wall. In particular, the channel case collapsing invariant measure has negative skewness,
with random states heavily leaning heavily towards the hot state, in stark contrast to free space,
where the limiting skewness is positive, with its states leaning heavily towards the cold state.
