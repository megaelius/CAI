The relativistic Lagrangian (L) justifies the importance of Reparametrization-Invariant (RI)
Systems and especially the first-order homogeneous L in the velocities. The usual gravitational
interaction term along with the finite propagational speed justifies the Minkowski space-time.
The argument presented implies only one time-like coordinate. By using the freedom of parametrization
for a process, it is argued that the corresponding causal structure results in the observed common
Arrow of Time and nonnegative masses of the particles. RI Systems are studied from the point of view
of the Lagrangian and extended Hamiltonian (H) formalism by using an Extended Poisson Bracket (EPB)
that is generally covariant. The EPB is defined over the phase-space-time in a way consistent with
the canonical quantization formalism (CQF). The corresponding extended H defines the classical
phase space-time of the system as null-space constraint and guarantees that the classical H corresponds
to the energy of the particle in the coordinate time parametrization. When the system is quantized
by following the CQF and the corresponding Hilbert space is defined as null-space of the extended
quantum H then the Schr\"odinger's equation emerges and the principle of superposition of quantum
states is justified. A connection is demonstrated between the positivity of the energy (E>0) and
the normalizability of the wave function by using the extended H that is relevant for the proper time
parametrization. It is demonstrated that the choice of the extended H is closely related to the meaning
of the process parameter $\lambda$. The two familiar roles that $\lambda$ can take upon, the coordinate
time and the proper time, are illustrated using the simplest one-dimensional reparametrization
invariant systems. In general, $\lambda$ can also be the proper length along the path of a particle
for appropriately chosen generator.
