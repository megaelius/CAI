The global one-dimensional quantum gravity is the model of quantum gravity which arises from the
global one-dimensionality conjecture within quantum general relativity, first considered by
the author in 2010 and then in 2012. In this model the global dimension is a determinant of a metric
of three-dimensional space embedded into an enveloping Lorentizan four-dimensional spacetime.
In 2012, it has already been presented by the author that this model can be extended to any Lorentzian
D + 1-dimensional spacetime, where D is a dimension of space, and resulting in the global one-dimensional
model of a higher dimensional quantum gravity. The purely quantum-mechanical part of this model
is a minimal effective model within the quantum geometrodynamics, introduced by J.A. Wheeler and
B.S. DeWitt in the 1960s, but the effective potential is manifestly different from the one considered
by Wheeler & DeWitt. Moreover, in our model the wave functionals solving the quantum gravity
are one-variable smooth functions and, therefore, the troublesome mathematical technique of
the Feynman functional integration present in the Hawking formulation of quantum gravity, is absent
is this model, what makes it a mathematically consistent theory of quantum gravitation. In this
paper, we discuss in some detail a certain part of the global one-dimensional model already proposed
in 2010, and then developed in 2012. The generalized functional expansion of the effective potential
and the residual approximation, which describe the embedded spaces which are maximally symmetric
three-dimensional Einstein's manifolds, whose lead to the Newton-Coulomb type potential in the
quantum gravity model, are considered. Furthermore, scenarios related to few selected specific
forms of the effective potential are suggested as physically interesting and discussed.
