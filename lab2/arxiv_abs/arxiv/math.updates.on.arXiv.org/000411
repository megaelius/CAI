Liouville Field Theory (LFT) is a model of $2d$ random surfaces involved in $2d$ string theory or
in the description of the fluctuations of metrics in $2d$ quantum gravity. This is a probabilistic
model that consists in weighting the shifted Free Field action with an interaction term involving
a cosmological constant $\mu$ and a background tachyon, which is nothing but a Gaussian multiplicative
chaos, formally the exponential of the Free Field times a constant $\gamma$, called the Liouville
conformal factor. We explain how to rigorously construct such a theory on the disk and review some
of its properties, like the KPZ formulae. The main input of our work is the study of the semiclassical
limit: when sending $\gamma$ to $0$ while keeping the quantity $\Lambda=\mu\gamma^2$ fixed (semiclassical
limit regime), we derive exact formulas for the Laplace transform of the Liouville field. Then we
prove that this field concentrates on the solution of the Liouville equation with prescribed negative
curvature $8\pi^2\Lambda$: i.e. we prove convergence in probability and characterize the leading
fluctuations, which are Gaussian and massive. Though considered as an ansatz in the whole physics
literature, it seems that it is the first rigorous probabilistic derivation of the semiclassical
limit of LFT. Also, we prove that this description of LFT as an hyperbolic geometry is rather sharp
by establishing a large deviation principle with an explicit good rate function. The same analysis
is carried out when we further weight the Liouville action with heavy matter operators. This procedure
appears when computing the $n$-points correlation functions of LFT. We show that the Liouville
metric concentrates on metrics with prescribed negative curvature $8\pi^2\Lambda$ and conical
singularities at the places of insertion.
