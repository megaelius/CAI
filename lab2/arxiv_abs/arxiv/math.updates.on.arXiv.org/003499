We propose and analyse randomized cubature formulae for the numerical integration of functions
with respect to a given probability measure $\mu$ defined on a domain $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$,
in any dimension $d$. Each cubature formula is conceived to be exact on a given finite-dimensional
subspace $V_n\subset L^2(\Gamma,\mu)$ of dimension $n$, and uses pointwise evaluations of the
integrand function $\phi : \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ at $m>n$ independent random points. These points
are distributed according to a suitable auxiliary probability measure that depends on $V_n$. We
show that, up to a logarithmic factor, a linear proportionality between $m$ and $n$ with dimension-independent
constant ensures stability of the cubature formula with very high probability. We also prove error
estimates in probability and in expectation for any $n\geq 1$ and $m>n$, thus covering both preasymptotic
and asymptotic regimes. Our analysis shows that the expected cubature error decays as $\sqrt{n/m}$
times the $L(\Gamma, \mu)$-best approximation error of $\phi$ in $V_n$. On the one hand, for fixed
$n$ and $m\to \infty$ our cubature formula can be seen as a variance reduction technique for a Monte
Carlo estimator, and can lead to enormous variance reduction for smooth integrand functions and
subspaces $V_n$ with spectral approximation properties. On the other hand, when we let $n,m\to\infty$,
our cubature becomes of high order with spectral convergence. Finally we show that, under a more
demanding (at least quadratic) proportionality betweeen $m$ and $n$, the weights of the cubature
are positive with very high probability. As an example of application, we discuss the case where
the domain $\Gamma$ has the structure of Cartesian product, $\mu$ is a product measure on $\Gamma$
and the space $V_n$ contains algebraic multivariate polynomials.
