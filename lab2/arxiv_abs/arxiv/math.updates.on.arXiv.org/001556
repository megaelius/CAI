We advocate that a generalized Kronheimer construction of the K\"ahler quotient crepant resolution
$\mathcal{M}_\zeta \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ of an orbifold singularity where
$\Gamma\subset \mathrm{SU(3)}$ is a finite subgroup naturally defines the field content and interaction
structure of a superconformal Chern-Simons Gauge Theory. This is supposedly the dual of an M2-brane
solution of $D=11$ supergravity with $\mathbb{C}\times\mathcal{M}_\zeta$ as transverse space.
We illustrate and discuss many aspects of this of constructions emphasizing that the equation $\pmb{p}\wedge\pmb{p}=0$
which provides the K\"ahler analogue of the holomorphic sector in the hyperK\"ahler moment map
equations canonically defines the structure of a universal superpotential in the CS theory. The
kernel of the above equation can be described as the orbit with respect to a quiver Lie group $\mathcal{G}_\Gamma$
of a locus $L_\Gamma \subset \mathrm{Hom}_\Gamma(\mathcal{Q}\otimes R,R)$ that has also a universal
definition. We discuss the relation between the coset manifold $\mathcal{G}_\Gamma/\mathcal{F}_\Gamma$,
the gauge group $\mathcal{F}_\Gamma$ being the maximal compact subgroup of the quiver group, the
moment map equations and the first Chern classes of the tautological vector bundles that are in a
one-to-one correspondence with the nontrivial irreps of $\Gamma$. These first Chern classes provide
a basis for the cohomology group $H^2(\mathcal{M}_\zeta)$. We discuss the relation with conjugacy
classes of $\Gamma$ and provide the explicit construction of several examples emphasizing the
role of a generalized McKay correspondence. The case of the ALE manifold resolution of $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$
singularities is utilized as a comparison term and new formulae related with the complex presentation
of Gibbons-Hawking metrics are exhibited.
