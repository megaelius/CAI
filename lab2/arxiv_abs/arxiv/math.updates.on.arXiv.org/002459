We study the free energy landscape defined by associating to each point in the interior of the ball
the free energy corresponding to a thin spherical band around it. This landscape is closely related
to several fundamental objects from spin glass theory. For example, the pure states in the decomposition
proved by Talagrand (2010) concentrate on bands corresponding to points on the sphere of radius
$\sqrt{Nq_{\star}}$ which asymptotically maximize the free energy, where $q_{\star}$ it the
rightmost point in the support of the overlap distribution. The famous ultrametricity property
proved by Panchenko (2013) defines a tree whose branching points have the same property with $q<q_{\star}$.
We prove that each of those points $\mathbf\sigma$, either a center of a pure state or a branching
point, also asymptotically minimizes the (extended) Hamiltonian over the sphere of radius $\|\mathbf\sigma\|$.
We derive a TAP formula for the free energy for any $q$ in the support of the overlap distribution,
expressed by the free energy of an explicit (deterministic) mixture corresponding to the restriction
of the Hamiltonian to an appropriate band and a ground state energy. For $q=q_{\star}$ and large
$\beta$, the latter free energy has a trivial (replica symmetric) expression. The minimality property
also allows us to obtain bounds on the support of the overlap distribution at positive temperature
in terms of the overlap distribution of the restriction of the Hamiltonian to the sphere of radius
$\sqrt{Nq_{\star}}$, in the $0$-temperature limit. Those bounds generalize to overlaps of samples
from the system at two different temperatures. The latter is used to prove that temperature chaos
cannot be detected at the level of free energies, for a class of models arising in the work of Chen and
Panchenko (2017).
