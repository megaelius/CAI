The {\em reticulation} of an algebra $A$ is a bounded distributive lattice whose prime spectrum
of ideals (or filters), endowed with the Stone topology, is homeomorphic to the prime spectrum of
congruences of $A$, with its own Stone topology. The reticulation allows algebraic and topological
properties to be transferred between the algebra $A$ and bounded distributive lattices, a transfer
which is facilitated if we can define a {\em reticulation functor} from a variety containing $A$
to the variety of (bounded) distributive lattices. In this paper, we continue the study of the reticulation
of a universal algebra initiated in \cite{retic}, where we have used the notion of a prime congruence
introduced through the term condition commutator. We characterize morphisms which admit an image
through the reticulation and investigate the kinds of varieties that admit reticulation functors;
we prove that these include semi--degenerate congruence--distributive varieties with the Compact
Intersection Property and semi--degenerate congruence--distributive varieties with congruence
intersection terms, as well as generalizations of these, and additional varietal properties ensure
that the reticulation functors preserve the injectivity of morphisms. We also study the property
of morphisms of having an image through the reticulation in relation to another property, involving
the complemented elements of congruence lattices, exemplify the transfer of properties through
the reticulation with conditions Going Up, Going Down, Lying Over and the Congruence Boolean Lifting
Property, and illustrate the applicability of such a transfer by using it to derive results for certain
types of varieties from properties of bounded distributive lattices.
