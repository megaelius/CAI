In this paper we consider the three dimensional exterior Stokes problem and study the solvability
of the corresponding continuous and discrete formulations that arise from the coupling of a dual-mixed
variational formulation with the boundary integral equation method. More precisely, after employing
the incompressibility condition to eliminate the pressure, we consider the resulting velocity-stress-vorticity
approach with different kind of boundary conditions on an annular bounded domain, and couple the
underlying equations with either one or two boundary integral equations arising from the application
of the usual and normal traces to the Green representation formula in the exterior unbounded region.
As a result, we obtain saddle point operator equations, which are then analyzed by the well-known
Babuska-Brezzi theory. We prove the well-posedness of the continuous formulations, identifying
previously the space of solutions of the associated homogeneous problem, and specify explicit
hypotheses to be satisfied by the finite element and boundary element subspaces in order to guarantee
the stability of the respective Galerkin schemes. In particular, following a similar analysis
given recently for the Laplacian, we are able to extend the classical Johnson & N\'ed\'elec
procedure to the present case, without assuming any restrictive smoothness requirement on the
coupling boundary, but only Lipschitz-continuity. In addition, and differently from known approaches
for the elasticity problem, we are also able to extend the Costabel & Han coupling procedure
to the 3D Stokes problem by providing a direct proof of the required coerciveness property, that
is without argueing by contradiction, and by using the natural norm of each space instead of mesh-dependent
norms. Finally, we briefly describe concrete examples of discrete spaces satisfying the aforementioned
hypotheses.
