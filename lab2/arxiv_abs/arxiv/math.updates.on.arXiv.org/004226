This paper studies device to device (D2D) coded-caching with information theoretic security guarantees.
A broadcast network consisting of a server, which has a library of files, and end users equipped with
cache memories, is considered. Information theoretic security guarantees for confidentiality
are imposed upon the files. The server populates the end user caches, after which D2D communications
enable the delivery of the requested files. Accordingly, we require that a user must not have access
to files it did not request, i.e., secure caching. First, a centralized coded caching scheme is provided
by jointly optimizing the cache placement and delivery policies. Next, a decentralized coded caching
scheme is developed that does not require the knowledge of the number of active users during the caching
phase. Both schemes utilize non-perfect secret sharing and one-time pad keying, to guarantee secure
caching. Furthermore, the proposed schemes provide secure delivery as a side benefit, i.e., any
external entity which overhears the transmitted signals during the delivery phase cannot obtain
any information about the database files. The proposed schemes provide the achievable upper bound
on the minimum delivery sum rate. Lower bounds on the required transmission sum rate are also derived
using cut-set arguments indicating the multiplicative gap between the lower and upper bounds.
Numerical results indicate that the gap vanishes with increasing memory size. Overall, the work
demonstrates the effectiveness of D2D communications in cache-aided systems even when confidentiality
constraints are imposed at the participating nodes and against external eavesdroppers.
