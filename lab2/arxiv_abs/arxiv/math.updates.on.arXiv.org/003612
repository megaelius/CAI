Consider the metric space $(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d),W_2)$ of square integrable laws on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ with the topology induced by the 2-Wasserstein distance $W_2$. Let $\Phi: \mathcal{P}_2(
\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function and $\mu_N$ be the empirical measure of a sample of $N$
random variables distributed as $\mu$. The main result of this paper is to show that under suitable
regularity conditions, we have \[ |\Phi(\mu) - \mathbb{E}\Phi(\mu_N)|= \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\frac{C_j}{N^j}
+ O(\frac{1}{N^k}), \] for some positive constants $C_1, \ldots, C_{k-1}$ that do not depend on
$N$, where $k$ corresponds to the degree of smoothness. We distinguish two cases: a) $\mu_N$ is the
empirical measure of $N$-samples from $\mu$; b) $\mu$ is a marginal law of McKean-Vlasov stochastic
differential equation in which case $\mu_N$ is an empirical law of marginal laws of the corresponding
particle system. The first case is studied using functional derivatives on the space of measures.
The second case relies on an It\^{o}-type formula for the flow of probability measures and is intimately
connected to PDEs on the space of measures, called the master equation in the literature of mean-field
games. We state the general regularity conditions required for each case and analyse the regularity
in the case of functionals of the laws of McKean-Vlasov SDEs. Ultimately, this work reveals quantitative
estimates of propagation of chaos for interacting particle systems. Furthermore, we are able to
provide weak propagation of chaos estimates for ensembles of interacting particles and show that
these may have some remarkable properties.
