We study a distributed antenna system where $L$ antenna terminals (ATs) are connected to a Central
Processor (CP) via digital error-free links of finite capacity $R_0$, and serve $K$ user terminals
(UTs). We contribute to the subject in the following ways: 1) for the uplink, we apply the "Compute
and Forward" (CoF) approach and examine the corresponding system optimization at finite SNR; 2)
For the downlink, we propose a novel precoding scheme nicknamed "Reverse Compute and Forward" (RCoF);
3) In both cases, we present low-complexity versions of CoF and RCoF based on standard scalar quantization
at the receivers, that lead to discrete-input discrete-output symmetric memoryless channel models
for which near-optimal performance can be achieved by standard single-user linear coding; 4) For
the case of large $R_0$, we propose a novel "Integer Forcing Beamforming" (IFB) scheme that generalizes
the popular zero-forcing beamforming and achieves sum rate performance close to the optimal Gaussian
Dirty-Paper Coding. The proposed uplink and downlink system optimization focuses specifically
on the ATs and UTs selection problem. We present low-complexity ATs and UTs selection schemes and
demonstrate, through Monte Carlo simulation in a realistic environment with fading and shadowing,
that the proposed schemes essentially eliminate the problem of rank deficiency of the system matrix
and greatly mitigate the non-integer penalty affecting CoF/RCoF at high SNR. Comparison with other
state-of-the art information theoretic schemes, such as "Quantize reMap and Forward" for the uplink
and "Compressed Dirty Paper Coding" for the downlink, show competitive performance of the proposed
approaches with significantly lower complexity.
