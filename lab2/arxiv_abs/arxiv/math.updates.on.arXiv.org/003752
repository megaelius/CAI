The article is dedicated to the memory of George Voronoi. It is concerned with ($p$-adic) $L$-functions
(in partially ($p$-adic) zeta functions) and cyclotomic ($p$-adic) (multiple) zeta values. The
beginning of the article contains a short summary of the results on the Bernoulli numbers associated
with the studies of George Voronoi. Results on multiple zeta values have presented by D. Zagier,
by P. Deligne and A.Goncharov, by A. Goncharov, by F. Brown, by C. Glanois and others. S. \"Unver have
investigated p-adic multiple zeta values in the depth two. Tannakian interpretation of p-adic
multiple zeta values is given by H. Furusho. Short history and connections among Galois groups,
fundamental groups, motives and arithmetic functions are presented in the talk by Y. Ihara. Results
on multiple zeta values, Galois groups and geometry of modular varieties has presented by Goncharov.
Interesting unipotent motivic fundamental group is defined and investigated by Deligne and Goncharov.
The framework of ($p$-adic) $L$-functions and ($p$-adic) (multiple) zeta values is based on Kubota-Leopoldt
$p$-adic $L$-functions and arithmetic $p$-adic $L$-functions by Iwasawa. Motives and ($p$-adic)
(multiple) zeta values by Glanois and by \"Unver, improper intersections of Kudla-Rapoport divisors
and Eisenstein series by Sankaran are reviewed. More fully the content of the article can be found
at the plan of the article. Sections 1-9 and subsection 11.1 (On some Shimura varieties and Siegel
modular forms) can be considered as an elementary introduction to the results of section 10 and subsection
11.2 (On improper intersections of Kudla-Rapoport divisors and Eisenstein series). Numerical
examples are included.
