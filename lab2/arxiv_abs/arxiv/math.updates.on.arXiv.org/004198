In two recent publications [Kov{\'a}cs, Larsson, and Mesforush, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 49(6), 2407-2429,
2011] and [Furihata, et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 56(2), 708-731, 2018], strong convergence of the
semi-discrete and fully discrete finite element methods are, respectively, proved for the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook
(CHC) equation, but without convergence rates revealed. The present work aims to fill the left gap,
by recovering strong convergence rates of (fully discrete) finite element methods for the CHC equation.
More accurately, strong convergence rates of the full discretization are analyzed, realized by
using Galerkin finite element methods based on piecewise continuous polynomials of degree at most
$r-1$, $r \geq 2$ for the spatial discretization and the backward Euler method for the temporal discretization.
Different from the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, the presence of the unbounded elliptic operator
in front of the cubic nonlinearity in the underlying model makes the error analysis much more challenging
and demanding. To address such difficulties, several new estimates and techniques are introduced.
It is shown that the fully discrete scheme possesses convergence rates of order $O(h^{\min\{\gamma,r\}}
|\ln h| )$ in space and order $O( k^{\frac{\min\{\gamma,r\}}4 } | \ln k|)$ in time, where $\gamma\in[3,4]$
from the assumption $\|A^{\frac{\gamma-2}2}Q^{\frac12}\|_{\mathcal{L}_2}<\infty$ is used
to characterize the spatial correlation of the noise process. In particular, a classical convergence
rate of order almost $O(h^4 + k )$ can be reached, even in multiple spatial dimension, when $r=4$ and
the aforementioned condition is fulfilled with $\gamma=4$.
