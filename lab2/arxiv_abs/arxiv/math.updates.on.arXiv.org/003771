Interdependent systems with mutual feedback are best represented as a multi-level mathematical
programming, in which the leader decisions determine the follower operations, which subsequently
affect the leader operations. For instance, a recent paper formulated the optimization of electricity
and natural gas systems with physical and economic couplings as a tri-level program that incorporates
some constraints cutting off first-level solutions (e.g., unit commitment decisions) based on
the dual solutions of the third-level problem (e.g., natural gas prices) to ensure economic viability.
This tri-level program can be reformulated as a single-level Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone
Program (MISOCP), which is equivalent to a "standard" MISOCP for a joint electricity-gas system
with additional constraints linking the first-level variables and the dual variables of the inner-continuous
problem. This paper studies how to apply Benders decomposition to this class of mathematical programs.
Since a traditional Benders decomposition results in computationally difficult subproblems,
the paper proposes a dedicated Benders decomposition where the subproblem is further decomposed
into two more tractable subproblems. The paper also shows that traditional acceleration techniques,
such as the normalization of Benders feasibility cuts, can be adapted to this setting. Experimental
results on a gas-aware unit commitment for coupled electricity and gas networks demonstrate the
computational benefits of the approach compared to a state-of-the-art mathematical programming
solver and an advanced Benders method with acceleration schemes.
