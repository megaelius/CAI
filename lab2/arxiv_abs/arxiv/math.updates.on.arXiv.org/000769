We present efficient and accurate numerical methods for computing the ground state and dynamics
of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) with nonlocal interactions based on a fast and accurate
evaluation of the long-range interactions via the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT).
We begin with a review of the fast and accurate NUFFT based method in \cite{JGB} for nonlocal interactions
where the singularity of the Fourier symbol of the interaction kernel at the origin can be canceled
by switching to spherical or polar coordinates. We then extend the method to compute other nonlocal
interactions whose Fourier symbols have stronger singularity at the origin that cannot be canceled
by the coordinate transform. Many of these interactions do not decay at infinity in the physical
space, which adds another layer of complexity since it is more difficult to impose the correct artificial
boundary conditions for the truncated bounded computational domain. The performance of our method
against other existing methods is illustrated numerically, with particular attention on the effect
of the size of the computational domain in the physical space. Finally, to study the ground state
and dynamics of the NLSE, we propose efficient and accurate numerical methods by combining the NUFFT
method for potential evaluation with the normalized gradient flow using backward Euler Fourier
pseudospectral discretization and time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method, respectively.
Extensive numerical comparisons are carried out between these methods and other existing methods
for computing the ground state and dynamics of the NLSE with various nonlocal interactions. Numerical
results show that our scheme performs much better than those existing methods in terms of both accuracy
and efficiency.
