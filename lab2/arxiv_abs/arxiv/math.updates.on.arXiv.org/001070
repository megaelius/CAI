Quadratic algebras are generalizations of Lie algebras which include the symmetry algebras of
2nd order superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions as special cases. The superintegrable systems
are exactly solvable physical systems in classical and quantum mechanics. Distinct superintegrable
systems and their quadratic algebras can be related by geometric contractions, induced by B\^ocher
contractions of the conformal Lie algebra $so(4,\mathbb {C})$ to itself. In 2 dimensions there
are two kinds of quadratic algebras, nondegenerate and degenerate. In the geometric case these
correspond to 3 parameter and 1 parameter potentials, respectively. In a previous paper we classified
all abstract parameter-free nondegenerate quadratic algebras in terms of canonical forms and
determined which of these can be realized as quadratic algebras of 2D nondegenerate superintegrable
systems on constant curvature spaces and Darboux spaces, and studied the relationship between
B\^ocher contractions of these systems and abstract contractions of the free quadratic algebras.
Here we carry out an analogous study of abstract parameter-free degenerate quadratic algebras
and their possible geometric realizations. We show that the only free degenerate quadratic algebras
that can be constructed in phase space are those that arise from superintegrability. We classify
all B\^ocher contractions relating degenerate superintegrable systems and, separately, all
abstract contractions relating free degenerate quadratic algebras. We point out the few exceptions
where abstract contractions cannot be realized by the geometric B\^ocher contractions,
