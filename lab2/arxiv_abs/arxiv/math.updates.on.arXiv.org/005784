The Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound rigorously shows that in quantum systems with short-range interactions,
the maximum amount of information that travels beyond an effective "light cone" decays exponentially
with distance from the light-cone front, which expands at finite velocity. Despite being a fundamental
result, existing bounds are often extremely loose, limiting their applications when quantitative
accuracy is necessary. We derive improved LR bounds in systems with finite-range interactions
that qualitatively strengthen previous bounds in two ways: (1) Our bound takes the new form $\|[\hat{A}_X(t),\hat{B}_Y(0)]\|\leq
C (u t/d_{XY})^{d_{XY}}$, much better than the previous exponential form in the large distance
$d_{XY}\to\infty$ and small time $t\to 0$ regions, and is often tight asymptotically. (2) Our method
directly leads to both qualitative and quantitative improvements in the LR velocity. Examples
of this we demonstrate are that in the Heisenberg XYZ model with spin $S$, we find $v\leq\text{const.}$
compared to the previous $v\propto S$ which diverges at large $S$; in Wen's $d$-dimensional quantum
rotor model with large spin $S$, we find $v\leq \mathrm{const}. \sqrt{d}$ instead of previous $v\propto
Sd$; in multiorbital Hubbard models with $N$ orbitals, we find $v\propto \sqrt{N}$ compared to
previous $v\propto N$; in the two-dimensional (2D) transverse field Ising model (TFIM) with coupling
strength $J$ and transverse field $h$, we find $v\leq \min\{4.27\sqrt{Jh},15.1J,12.1h\}$ instead
of previous $v\leq 43.5 J$; and for the $d$-dimensional TFIM our speed scales as $v\sim \sqrt{d}$
instead of previous $v\sim d$. These improved LR speeds also allow us to prove a finite upper bound
on ground state correlation length in some nontrivial limits where the previous bounds diverge.
