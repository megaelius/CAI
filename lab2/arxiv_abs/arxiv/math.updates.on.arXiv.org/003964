We consider an elastic manifold of internal dimension $d$ and length $L$ pinned in a $N$ dimensional
random potential and confined by an additional parabolic potential of curvature $\mu$. We are interested
in the mean spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of the Hessian matrix $K$ at the absolute minimum of
the total energy. We use the replica approach to derive the system of equations for $\rho(\lambda)$
for a fixed $L^d$ in the $N \to \infty$ limit extending $d=0$ results of our previous work. A particular
attention is devoted to analyzing the limit of extended lattice systems by letting $L\to \infty$.
In all cases we show that for a confinement curvature $\mu$ exceeding a critical value $\mu_c$, the
so-called "Larkin mass", the system is replica-symmetric and the Hessian spectrum is always gapped
(from zero). The gap vanishes quadratically at $\mu\to \mu_c$. For $\mu<\mu_c$ the replica symmetry
breaking (RSB) occurs and the Hessian spectrum is either gapped or extends down to zero, depending
on whether RSB is 1-step or full. In the 1-RSB case the gap vanishes in all $d$ as $(\mu_c-\mu)^4$ near
the transition. In the full RSB case the gap is identically zero. A set of specific landscapes realize
the so-called "marginal cases" in $d=1,2$ which share both feature of the 1-step and the full RSB
solution, and exhibit some scale invariance. We also obtain the average Green function associated
to the Hessian and find that at the edge of the spectrum it decays exponentially in the distance within
the internal space of the manifold with a length scale equal in all cases to the Larkin length introduced
in the theory of pinning.
