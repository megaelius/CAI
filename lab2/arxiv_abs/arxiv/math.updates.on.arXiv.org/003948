We study fundamental performance limitations of distributed feedback control in large-scale
networked dynamical systems. Specifically, we address the question of whether dynamic feedback
controllers perform better than static (memoryless) ones when subject to locality constraints.
We consider distributed linear consensus and vehicular formation control problems modeled over
toric lattice networks. For the resulting spatially invariant systems we study the large-scale
asymptotics (in network size) of global performance metrics that quantify the level of network
coherence. With static feedback from relative state measurements, such metrics are known to scale
unfavorably in lattices of low spatial dimensions, preventing, for example, a 1-dimensional string
of vehicles to move like a rigid object. We show that the same limitations in general apply also to
dynamic feedback control that is locally of first order. This means that the addition of one local
state to the controller gives a similar asymptotic performance to the memoryless case. This holds
unless the controller can access noiseless measurements of its local state with respect to an absolute
reference frame, in which case the addition of controller memory may fundamentally improve performance.
In simulations of platoons with 20-200 vehicles we show that the performance limitations we derive
manifest as unwanted accordion-like motions. Similar behaviors are to be expected in any network
that is embeddable in a low-dimensional toric lattice, and the same fundamental limitations would
apply. To derive our results, we present a general technical framework for the analysis of stability
and performance of spatially invariant systems in the limit of large networks.
