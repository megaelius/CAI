Common efficient schemes for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as projection
or fractional step methods, have limited temporal accuracy as a result of matrix splitting errors,
or introduce errors near the domain boundaries (which destroy uniform convergence to the solution).
In this paper we recast the incompressible (constant density) Navier-Stokes equations (with the
velocity prescribed at the boundary) as an equivalent system, for the primary variables velocity
and pressure. We do this in the usual way away from the boundaries, by replacing the incompressibility
condition on the velocity by a Poisson equation for the pressure. The key difference from the usual
approaches occurs at the boundaries, where we use boundary conditions that unequivocally allow
the pressure to be recovered from knowledge of the velocity at any fixed time. This avoids the common
difficulty of an, apparently, over-determined Poisson problem. Since in this alternative formulation
the pressure can be accurately and efficiently recovered from the velocity, the recast equations
are ideal for numerical marching methods. The new system can be discretized using a variety of methods,
in principle to any desired order of accuracy. In this work we illustrate the approach with a 2-D second
order finite difference scheme on a Cartesian grid, and devise an algorithm to solve the equations
on domains with curved (non-conforming) boundaries, including a case with a non-trivial topology
(a circular obstruction inside the domain). This algorithm achieves second order accuracy (in
L-infinity), for both the velocity and the pressure. The scheme has a natural extension to 3-D.
