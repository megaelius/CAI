Extensive research has already started on 6G and beyond wireless technologies due to the envisioned
new use-cases and potential new requirements for future wireless networks. Although a plethora
of modern physical layer solutions have been introduced in the last few decades, it is undeniable
that a level of saturation has been reached in terms of the available spectrum, adapted modulation/coding
solutions and accordingly the maximum capacity. Within this context, communications through
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which enable novel and effective functionalities
including wave absorption, tuneable anomalous reflection, and reflection phase modification,
appear as a potential candidate to overcome the inherent drawbacks of legacy wireless systems.
The core idea of RISs is the transformation of the uncontrollable and random wireless propagation
environment into a reconfigurable communication system entity that plays an active role in forwarding
information. In this paper, the well-known multipath fading phenomenon is revisited in mobile
wireless communication systems, and novel and unique solutions are introduced from the perspective
of RISs. The feasibility of eliminating or mitigating the multipath fading effect stemming from
the movement of mobile receivers is also investigated by utilizing the RISs. It is shown that rapid
fluctuations in the received signal strength due to the Doppler effect can be effectively reduced
by using the real-time tuneable RISs. It is also proven that the multipath fading effect can be totally
eliminated when all reflectors in a propagation environment are coated with RISs, while even a few
RISs can significantly reduce the Doppler spread as well as the deep fades in the received signal
for general propagation environments with several interacting objects.
