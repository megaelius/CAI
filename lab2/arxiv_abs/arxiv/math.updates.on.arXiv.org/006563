Placement delivery arrays for distributed computing (Comp-PDAs) have recently been proposed
as a framework to construct universal computing schemes for MapReduce-like systems. In this work,
we extend this concept to systems with straggling nodes, i.e., to systems where a subset of the nodes
cannot accomplish the assigned map computations in due time. Unlike most previous works that focused
on computing linear functions, our results are universal and apply for arbitrary map and reduce
functions. Our contributions are as follows. Firstly, we show how to construct a universal coded
computing scheme for MapReduce-like systems with straggling nodes from any given Comp-PDA. We
also characterize the storage and communication loads of the resulting scheme in terms of the Comp-PDA
parameters. Then, we prove an information-theoretic converse bound on the storage-communication
(SC) tradeoff achieved by universal computing schemes with straggling nodes. We show that the information-theoretic
bound matches the performance achieved by the coded computing schemes with straggling nodes corresponding
to the Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) PDAs, i.e., to the Comp-PDAs describing Maddah-Ali and Niesen's
coded caching scheme. Interestingly, the same Comp-PDAs (the MAN-PDAs) are optimal for any number
of straggling nodes, which implies that the map phase of optimal coded computing schemes does not
need to be adapted to the number of stragglers in the system. We finally prove that while the points
that lie exactly on the fundamental SC tradeoff cannot be achieved with Comp-PDAs that require smaller
number of files than the MAN-PDAs, this is possible for some of the points that lie close to the SC tradeoff.
For these latter points, the decrease in the requested number of files can be exponential in the number
of nodes of the system.
