This paper proposes a frequency/time hybrid integral-equation method for the time dependent wave
equation in two and three-dimensional spatial domains. Relying on Fourier Transformation in time,
the method utilizes a fixed (time-independent) number of frequency-domain integral-equation
solutions to evaluate, with superalgebraically-small errors, time domain solutions for arbitrarily
long times. The approach relies on two main elements, namely, 1) A smooth time-windowing methodology
that enables accurate band-limited representations for arbitrarily-long time signals, and 2)
A novel Fourier transform approach which, in a time-parallel manner and without causing spurious
periodicity effects, delivers numerically dispersionless spectrally-accurate solutions.
A similar hybrid technique can be obtained on the basis of Laplace transforms instead of Fourier
transforms, but we do not consider the Laplace-based method in the present contribution. The algorithm
can handle dispersive media, it can tackle complex physical structures, it enables parallelization
in time in a straightforward manner, and it allows for time leaping---that is, solution sampling
at any given time $T$ at $\mathcal{O}(1)$-bounded sampling cost, for arbitrarily large values
of $T$, and without requirement of evaluation of the solution at intermediate times. The proposed
frequency-time hybridization strategy, which generalizes to any linear partial differential
equation in the time domain for which frequency-domain solutions can be obtained (including e.g.
the time-domain Maxwell equations), and which is applicable in a wide range of scientific and engineering
contexts, provides significant advantages over other available alternatives such as volumetric
discretization and convolution-quadrature approaches.
