Let $M$ be a stratum of a compact stratified space $A$. It is equipped with a general adapted metric
$g$, which is slightly more general than the adapted metrics of Nagase and Brasselet-Hector-Saralegi.
In particular, $g$ has a general type, which is an extension of the type of an adapted metric. A restriction
on this general type is assumed, and then $g$ is called good. We consider the maximum/minimun ideal
boundary condition, $d_{\text{max/min}}$, of the compactly supported de~Rham complex on $M$,
in the sense of Br\"uning-Lesch, defining the cohomology $H^*_{\text{max/min}}(M)$, and with
corresponding Laplacian $\Delta_{\text{max/min}}$. The first main theorem states that $\Delta_{\text{max/min}}$
has a discrete spectrum satisfying a weak form of the Weyl's asymptotic formula. The second main
theorem is a version of Morse inequalities using $H_{\text{max/min}}^*(M)$ and what we call rel-Morse
functions. The proofs of both theorems involve a version for $d_{\text{max/min}}$ of the Witten's
perturbation of the de~Rham complex, as well as certain perturbation of the Dunkl harmonic oscillator
previously studied by the authors using classical perturbation theory. The condition on $g$ to
be good is general enough in the following sense: using intersection homology when $A$ is a stratified
pseudomanifold, for any perversity $\bar p\le\bar m$, there is an associated good adapted metric
on $M$ satisfying the Nagase isomorphism $H^r_{\text{max}}(M)\cong I^{\bar p}H_r(A)^*$ ($r\in\mathbb{N}$).
If $M$ is oriented and $\bar p\ge\bar n$, we also get $H^r_{\text{min}}(M)\cong I^{\bar p}H_r(A)$.
Thus our version of the Morse inequalities can be described in terms of $I^{\bar p}H_*(A)$.
