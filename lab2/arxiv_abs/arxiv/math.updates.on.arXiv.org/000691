Multivariate orthogonal polynomials in $D$ real dimensions are considered from the perspective
of the Cholesky factorization of a moment matrix. The approach allows for the construction of corresponding
multivariate orthogonal polynomials, associated second kind functions, Jacobi type matrices
and associated three term relations and also Christoffel-Darboux formul{\ae}. The multivariate
orthogonal polynomials, its second kind functions and the corresponding Christoffel-Darboux
kernels are shown to be quasi-determinants --as well as Schur complements-- of bordered truncations
of the moment matrix; quasi-tau functions are introduced. It is proven that the second kind functions
are multivariate Cauchy transforms of the multivariate orthogonal polynomials. Discrete and
continuous deformations of the measure lead to Toda type integrable hierarchy, being the corresponding
flows described through Lax and Zakharov-Shabat equations; bilinear equations are found. Varying
size matrix nonlinear partial difference and differential equations of the 2D Toda lattice type
are shown to be solved by matrix coefficients of the multivariate orthogonal polynomials. The discrete
flows lead to expressions for the multivariate orthogonal polynomials and its second kind functions
in terms of shifted quasi-tau matrices, which generalize to the multidimensional realm those that
relate the Baker and adjoint Baker functions with ratios of Miwa shifted $\tau$-functions in the
1D scenario. In this context, the multivariate extension of the elementary Darboux transformation
is given in terms of quasi-determinants of matrices built up by the evaluation, at a poised set of
nodes lying in an appropriate hyperplane in $\mathbb R^D$, of the multivariate orthogonal polynomials.
The multivariate Christoffel formula for the iteration of $m$ elementary Darboux transformations
is given as a quasi-determinant.
