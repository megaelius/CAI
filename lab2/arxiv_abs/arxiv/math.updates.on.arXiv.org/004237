In this paper, we present all constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations with ${\rm SU}(2)$
gauge symmetry for an arbitrary constant non-Abelian current in Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^n$
of arbitrary finite dimension $n$. Namely, we obtain all solutions of the special system of $3n$
cubic equations with $3n$ unknowns and $3n$ parameters. Using the invariance of the Yang-Mills
equations under the orthogonal transformations of coordinates and gauge invariance, we choose
a specific system of coordinates and a specific gauge fixing for each constant current and obtain
all constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in this system of coordinates with this gauge
fixing, and then in the original system of coordinates with the original gauge fixing. We use the
singular value decomposition method and the method of two-sheeted covering of orthogonal group
by spin group to do this. We prove that the number ($0$, $1$, or $2$) of constant solutions of the Yang-Mills
equations in terms of the strength of the Yang-Mills field depends on the singular values of the matrix
of current. The explicit form of all solutions and the invariant $F^2$ can always be written using
singular values of this matrix. Nonconstant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations can be considered
in the form of series of perturbation theory. The relevance of the study is explained by the fact that
the Yang-Mills equations describe electroweak interactions in the case of the Lie group ${\rm SU}(2)$.
The results of this paper are new and can be used to solve some problems in particle physics, in particular,
to describe physical vacuum and to fully understand a quantum gauge theory.
