Boolean, free and monotone cumulants as well as relations among them, have proven to be important
in the study of non-commutative probability theory. Quite notably, Boolean cumulants were successfully
used to study free infinite divisibility via the Boolean Bercovici--Pata bijection. On the other
hand, in recent years the concept of infinitesimal free probability has been developed, together
with the notion of infinitesimal free cumulants which can be useful in the context of combinatorial
questions. In this paper, infinitesimal versions of Boolean and monotone cumulants are introduced.
We show that the known relations among those cumulants still hold in the infinitesimal framework.
Our approach is based on the use of Grassmann algebra. Formulas involving infinitesimal cumulants
can be obtained by applying a formal derivation to known formulas. The relations between the various
types of cumulants turn out to be captured via the shuffle algebra approach to moment-cumulant relations
in non-commutative probability theory. In this formulation, (free, Boolean and monotone) cumulants
are represented as elements of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal characters over a particular combinatorial
Hopf algebra. The latter consists of the graded connected double tensor algebra defined over a non-commutative
probability space and is neither commutative nor cocommutative. In this note it is shown how the
shuffle algebra approach naturally extends to the notion of infinitesimal non-commutative probability
space. The basic step consists in replacing the base field as target space of linear Hopf algebra
maps by the Grassmann algebra over the base field. We also consider the infinitesimal analog of the
Boolean Bercovici--Pata map.
