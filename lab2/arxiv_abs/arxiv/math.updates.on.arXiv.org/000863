A detailed theoretical investigation is given which demonstrates that a recently proposed statistical
scaling symmetry is physically void. Although this scaling is mathematically admitted as a unique
symmetry transformation by the underlying statistical equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes
turbulence on the level of the functional Hopf equation, by closer inspection, however, it leads
to physical inconsistencies and erroneous conclusions in the theory of turbulence. The new statistical
symmetry is thus misleading in so far as it forms within an unmodelled theory an analytical result
which at the same time lacks physical consistency. Our investigation will expose this inconsistency
on different levels of statistical description, where on each level we will gain new insights for
its non-physical transformation behavior. With a view to generate invariant turbulent scaling
laws, the consequences will be finally discussed when trying to analytically exploit such a symmetry.
In fact, a mismatch between theory and numerical experiment is conclusively quantified. We ultimately
propose a general strategy on how to not only track unphysical statistical symmetries, but also
on how to avoid generating such misleading invariance results from the outset. All the more so as
this specific study on a physically inconsistent scaling symmetry only serves as a representative
example within the broader context of statistical invariance analysis. In this sense our investigation
is applicable to all areas of statistical physics in which symmetries get determined in order to
either characterize complex dynamical systems, or in order to extract physically useful and meaningful
information from the underlying dynamical process itself.
