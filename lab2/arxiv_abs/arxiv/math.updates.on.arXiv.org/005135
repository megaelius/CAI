We give a simplified and complete proof of the convergence of the chordal exploration process in
critical FK-Ising percolation to chordal SLE$_\kappa( \kappa-6)$ with $\kappa=16/3$. Our proof
follows the classical excursion-construction of SLE$_\kappa(\kappa-6)$ processes in the continuum
and we are thus led to introduce suitable cut-off stopping times in order to analyse the behaviour
of the driving function of the discrete system when Dobrushin boundary condition collapses to a
single point. Our proof is very different from [KS15, KS16] as it only relies on the convergence to
the chordal SLE$_{\kappa}$ process in Dobrushin boundary condition and does not require the introduction
of a new observable. Still, it relies crucially on several ingredients: a) the powerful topological
framework developed in [KS17] as well as its follow-up paper [CDCH$^+$14], b) the strong RSW Theorem
from [CDCH16], c) the proof is inspired from the appendix A in [BH16]. One important emphasis of this
paper is to carefully write down some properties which are often considered {\em folklore} in the
literature but which are only justified so far by hand-waving arguments. The main examples of these
are: 1) the convergence of natural discrete stopping times to their continuous analogues. (The
usual hand-waving argument destroys the spatial Markov property). 2) the fact that the discrete
spatial Markov property is preserved in the the scaling limit. (The enemy being that $\mathbb{E}[X_n
|\, Y_n]$ does not necessarily converge to $\mathbb{E}[X|\, Y]$ when $(X_n,Y_n)\to (X,Y)$). We
end the paper with a detailed sketch of the convergence to radial SLE$_\kappa( \kappa-6)$ when $\kappa=16/3$
as well as the derivation of Onsager's one-arm exponent $1/8$.
