We revisit the scaling analysis and commonly accepted conditions for the validity of the standard,
reverse and total quasi-steady-state approximations (sQSSA, rQSSA and tQSSA) through the lens
of dimensional Tikhonov--Fenichel small parameters and their respective critical manifolds.
By combining Tikhonov--Fenichel small parameter with scaling analysis, we derive improved upper
bounds on the error for the sQSSA, rQSSA and tQSSA. We find that the condition for the validity of the
rQSSA is far less restrictive than was previously assumed, and we derive a new small parameter that
determines the validity of this approximation. Moreover, we show for the first time that the critical
manifold of the rQSSA contains a singular point where normal hyperbolicity is lost. Associated
with this singularity is a transcritical bifurcation, and the corresponding normal form of this
bifurcation is recovered through scaling analysis. It is commonly accepted that the rQSSA is only
valid in regions of parameter space where the influence of the singular point can be ignored. However,
by using the method of slowly-varying Lyapunov functions, we provide asymptotic estimates for
the validity of the rQSSA in parameter regions where the effect of the singular point cannot be disregarded.
In doing so, we extend the established domain of validity for the rQSSA. Previous analysis has suggested
that the rQSSA is only valid when initial enzyme concentrations greatly exceed initial substrate
concentrations. However, our results indicate that this approximation can be valid when initial
enzyme and substrate concentrations are of equal magnitude. Consequently, this opens the possibility
of utilizing the rQSSA to model enzyme catalyzed reactions and estimate kinetic parameters in enzymatic
assays at much lower enzyme to substrate ratios than was previously thought.
