In earlier work, Katz exhibited some very simple one parameter families of exponential sums which
gave rigid local systems on the affine line in characteristic p whose geometric (and usually, arithmetic)
monodromy groups were SL(2,q), and he exhibited other such very simple families giving SU(3,q).
[Here q is a power of the characteristic p with p odd]. In this paper, we exhibit equally simple families
whose geometric monodromy groups are the alternating groups Alt(2q). $. We also determine their
arithmetic monodromy groups. By Raynaud's solution of the Abhyankar Conjecture, any finite simple
group whose order is divisible by p will occur as the geometric monodromy group of some local system
on the affine line in characteristic p; the interest here is that it occurs in our particularly simple
local systems. In the earlier work of Katz, he used a theorem to Kubert to know that the monodromy groups
in question were finite, then work of Gross to determine which finite groups they were. Here we do
not have, at present, any direct way of showing this finiteness. Rather, the situation is more complicated
and more interesting. Using some basic information about these local systems, a fundamental dichotomy
is proved: The geometric monodromy group is either Alt(2q) or it is the special orthogonal group
SO(2q-1). An elementary polynomial identity is used to show that the third moment is 1. This rules
out the SO(2q-1) case. This roundabout method establishes the theorem. It would be interesting
to find a "direct" proof that these local systems have integer (rather than rational) traces; this
integrality is in fact equivalent to their monodromy groups being finite, Even if one had such a direct
proof, it would still require serious group theory to show that their geometric monodromy groups
are the alternating groups.
