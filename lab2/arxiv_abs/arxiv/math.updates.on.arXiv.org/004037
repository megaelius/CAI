We investigate the scaling limit of the seed bank diffusion when reproduction and migration (to
and from the seed bank) happen on different time-scales. More precisely, we consider the case when
migration is `slow' and reproduction is `standard' (in the original time-scale) and then switch
to a new, accelerated time-scale, where migration is `standard' and reproduction is `fast'. This
is motivated by models for bacterial dormancy, where periods of quiescence can be orders of magnitude
larger than reproductive times, and where it is expected to find non-trivial degenerate genealogies
on the evolutionary time-scale. However, the above scaling regime is not only interesting from
a biological perspective, but also from a mathematical point of view, since it provides a prototypical
example where the expected scaling limit of a continuous diffusion should (and will be) a jump-diffusion.
For this situation, standard convergence results often seem to fail in multiple ways. For example,
since the set of continuous paths from a closed subset of the c\`adl\`ag paths in each of the classical
Skorohod topologies $J_1, J_2, M_1$ and $M_2$, none of them can be employed for tightness on path-space.
Further, a na\"ive direct rescaling of the Markov generator corresponding to the continuous diffusion
immediately leads to a blow-up of the diffusion coefficient. Still, one can identify a well-defined
limit via duality in a surprisingly non-technical way. Indeed, we show that a certain duality relation
is in some sense stable under passage to the limit and allows an identification of the limit, avoiding
all technicalities related to the blow-up in the classical generator. The result then boils down
to a convergence criterion for time-continuous Markov chains in a separation of time-scales regime,
which is of independent interest.
