The phenomenon of data hiding, i.e. the existence of pairs of states of a bipartite system that are
perfectly distinguishable via general entangled measurements yet almost indistinguishable
under LOCC, is a distinctive signature of nonclassicality. The relevant figure of merit is the maximal
ratio (called data hiding ratio) between the distinguishability norms associated with the two
sets of measurements we are comparing, typically all measurements vs LOCC protocols. For a bipartite
$n\times n$ quantum system, it is known that the data hiding ratio scales as $n$, i.e. the square root
of the real dimension of the local state space of density matrices. We show that for bipartite $n_A\times
n_B$ systems the maximum data hiding ratio against LOCC protocols is $\Theta\left(\min\{n_A,n_B\}\right)$.
This scaling is better than the previously obtained upper bounds $O\left(\sqrt{n_A n_B}\right)$
and $\min\{n_A^2, n_B^2\}$, and moreover our intuitive argument yields constants close to optimal.
In this paper, we investigate data hiding in the more general context of general probabilistic theories
(GPTs), an axiomatic framework for physical theories encompassing only the most basic requirements
about the predictive power of the theory. The main result of the paper is the determination of the
maximal data hiding ratio obtainable in an arbitrary GPT, which is shown to scale linearly in the
minimum of the local dimensions. We exhibit an explicit model achieving this bound up to additive
constants, finding that the quantum mechanical data hiding ratio is only of the order of the square
root of the maximal one. Our proof rests crucially on an unexpected link between data hiding and the
theory of projective and injective tensor products of Banach spaces. Finally, we develop a body
of techniques to compute data hiding ratios for a variety of restricted classes of GPTs that support
further symmetries.
