In this article, we derive many properties of \'etale stacks in various contexts, and prove that
\'etale stacks may be characterized categorically as those stacks that arise as prolongations
of stacks on a site of spaces and local homeomorphisms. Moreover, we show that the bicategory of \'etale
differentiable stacks and local diffeomorphisms is equivalent to the 2-topos of stacks on the site
of smooth manifolds and local diffeomorphisms. An analogous statement holds for other flavors
of manifolds (topological, $C^k,$ complex, super...), and topological spaces locally homeomorphic
to a given space $X.$ A slight modification of this result also holds in an even more general context,
including all \'etale topological stacks, and Zariski \'etale stacks, and we also sketch a proof
of an analogous characterization of Deligne-Mumford algebraic stacks. We go on to characterize
effective \'etale stacks as precisely those stacks arising as the prolongations of sheaves. It
follows that \'etale stacks (and in particular orbifolds) induce a small gerbe over their effective
part, and all gerbes over effective \'etale stacks arise in this way. As an application, we show that
well known Lie groupoids arising in foliation theory give presentations for certain moduli stacks.
For example, there exists a classifying stack for Riemannian metrics, presented by Haefliger's
groupoid $R\Gamma$ and submersions into this stack classify Riemannian foliations, and similarly
for symplectic structures, with the role of $R\Gamma$ replaced with $\Gamma^{Sp}.$ We also prove
some unexpected results, for example: the category of smooth $n$-manifolds and local diffeomorphisms
has binary products.
