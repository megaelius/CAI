For a square matrix $A$ over a field $F$, it is known that $\mathrm{rank}(A) + \mathrm{rank}(I-A)
= \mathrm{rank}(I) + \mathrm{rank}(A-A^2)$. The main goal of this article is to start a program
to characterize and generalize such rank identities by constructing the appropriate `universal'
objects. We construct a functor $L$ from the category of rings to the category of commutative monoids
and initiate the study of so-called ranked rings. For a commutative monoid $G$, in a broad sense,
a $(G, \rho)$-ranked ring $\mathcal{R}$ is a ring endowed with a system $\rho$ of compatible $G$-valued
`rank' functions on $M_n(\mathcal{R})$ (for $n \in \mathbb{N}$). A field $F$ may be viewed as a ranked
ring with a $\mathbb{Z}_+$-valued rank system consisting of the usual rank functions on $M_n(F)$
(for $n \in \mathbb{N})$. We show that a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{R}$ with center $\mathscr{Z}$
may be endowed with a $\mathscr{Z}_{+}$-valued rank system. We study the structure of the $L$-monoid
of B\'ezout domains and obtain a complete picture of the $L$-monoid in terms of divisor multichains
for principal ideal domains (PIDs) and $\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{C})$, the ring of entire functions.
In the context of the polynomial ring $F[t]$ (or $\mathcal{O}(\mathbb{C})$), this yields an algorithm
to generate rank identities in ranked $F$-algebras (or complex Banach algebras) via the polynomial
functional calculus (or holomorphic functional calculus). As an application of these abstract
rank identities, we show that the sum of finitely many idempotents $E_1, \cdots, E_m$ in a finite
von Neumann algebra is an idempotent if and only if they are mutually orthogonal i.e. $E_i E_j = \delta_{ij}E_i,
1\le i, j \le m$. In contrast, this does not hold in general in the ring of bounded operators on an infinite-dimensional
complex Hilbert space, which is a properly infinite von Neumann algebra.
