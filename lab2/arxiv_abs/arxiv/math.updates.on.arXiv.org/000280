We study active array imaging of small but strong scatterers in homogeneous media when multiple
scattering between them is important. We use the Foldy-Lax equations to model wave propagation
with multiple scattering when the scatterers are small relative to the wavelength. In active array
imaging we seek to locate the positions and reflectivities of the scatterers, that is, to determine
the support of the reflectivity vector and the values of its nonzero elements from echoes recorded
on the array. This is a nonlinear inverse problem because of the multiple scattering. We show in this
paper how to avoid the nonlinearity and form images non-iteratively through a two-step process
which involves $\ell_1$ norm minimization. However, under certain illuminations imaging may
be affected by screening, where some scatterers are obscured by multiple scattering. This problem
can be mitigated by using multiple and diverse illuminations. In this case, we determine solution
vectors that have a common support. The uniqueness and stability of the support of the reflectivity
vector obtained with single or multiple illuminations are analyzed, showing that the errors are
proportional to the amount of noise in the data with a proportionality factor dependent on the sparsity
of the solution and the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix, which is determined by the geometry
of the imaging array. Finally, to filter out noise and improve the resolution of the images, we propose
an approach that combines optimal illuminations using the singular value decomposition of the
response matrix together with sparsity promoting optimization jointly for all illuminations.
This work is an extension of our previous paper [5] on imaging using optimization techniques where
we now account for multiple scattering effects.
