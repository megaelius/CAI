In this paper we present a stable day-to-day dynamical system for drivers' departure time choice
at a single bottleneck. We first define within-day traffic dynamics with the point queue model,
costs, the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE), and the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE).
We then identify three behavioral principles: (i) Drivers choose their departure and arrival times
in a backward fashion (backward choice principle); (ii) After choosing the arrival times, they
update their departure times to balance the total costs (cost balancing principle); (iii) They
choose their arrival times to reduce their scheduling costs or gain their scheduling payoffs (scheduling
cost reducing or scheduling payoff gaining principle). In this sense, drivers' departure and arrival
time choices are driven by their scheduling payoff choice. With a single tube or imaginary road model,
we convert the nonlocal day-to-day arrival time shifting problem to a local scheduling payoff shifting
problem. After introducing a new variable for the imaginary density, we apply the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards
(LWR) model to describe the day-to-day dynamics of scheduling payoff choice and present splitting
and cost balancing schemes to determine arrival and departure flow-rates accordingly. We also
develop the corresponding discrete models for numerical solutions. We theoretically prove that
the day-to-day stationary state of the LWR model leads to the scheduling payoff user equilibrium
(SPUE), which is equivalent to both DTUE and ATUE and stable. We use one numerical example to demonstrate
the effectiveness and stability of the new day-to-day dynamical model.
