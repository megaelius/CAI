In this paper we consider a problem of initial data identification from the final time observation
for homogeneous parabolic problems. It is well-known that such problems are exponentially ill-posed
due to the strong smoothing property of parabolic equations. We are interested in a situation when
the initial data we intend to recover is known to be sparse, i.e. its support has Lebesgue measure
zero. We formulate the problem as an optimal control problem and incorporate the information on
the sparsity of the unknown initial data into the structure of the objective functional. In particular,
we are looking for the control variable in the space of regular Borel measures and use the corresponding
norm as a regularization term in the objective functional. This leads to a convex but non-smooth
optimization problem. For the discretization we use continuous piecewise linear finite elements
in space and discontinuous Galerkin finite elements of arbitrary degree in time. For the general
case we establish error estimates for the state variable. Under a certain structural assumption,
we show that the control variable consists of a finite linear combination of Dirac measures. For
this case we obtain error estimates for the locations of Dirac measures as well as for the corresponding
coefficients. The key to the numerical analysis are the sharp smoothing type pointwise finite element
error estimates for homogeneous parabolic problems, which are of independent interest. Moreover,
we discuss an efficient algorithmic approach to the problem and show several numerical experiments
illustrating our theoretical results.
