We prove a general width duality theorem for combinatorial structures with well-defined notions
of cohesion and separation. These might be graphs and matroids, but can be much more general or quite
different. The theorem asserts a duality between the existence of high cohesiveness somewhere
local and a global overall tree structure. We describe cohesive substructures in a unified way in
the format of tangles: as orientations of low-order separations satisfying certain consistency
axioms. These axioms can be expressed without reference to the underlying structure, such as a graph
or matroid, but just in terms of the poset of the separations themselves. This makes it possible to
identify tangles, and apply our tangle-tree duality theorem, in very diverse settings. Our result
implies all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in graph minor theory, such as path-width,
tree-width, branch-width or rank-width. It yields new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width
and path-width. It implies the existence of width parameters dual to cohesive substructures such
as $k$-blocks, edge-tangles, or given subsets of tangles, for which no width duality theorems were
previously known. Abstract separation systems can be found also in structures quite unlike graphs
and matroids. For example, our theorem can be applied to image analysis by capturing the regions
of an image as tangles of separations defined as natural partitions of its set of pixels. It can be
applied in big data contexts by capturing clusters as tangles. It can be applied in the social sciences,
e.g. by capturing as tangles the few typical mindsets of individuals found by a survey. It could also
be applied in pure mathematics, e.g. to separations of compact manifolds.
