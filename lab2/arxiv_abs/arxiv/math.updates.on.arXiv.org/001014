Long before the invention of Feynman diagrams, engineers were using similar diagrams to reason
about electrical circuits and more general networks containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic
and chemical components. We can formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric
monoidal categories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given
by addition. In this approach, each kind of network corresponds to a prop, and each network of this
kind is a morphism in that prop. A network with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to $n$,
putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring.
Here we work out the details of this approach for various kinds of electrical circuits, starting
with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive wires, then circuits with passive linear
components, and then circuits that also have voltage and current sources. Each kind of circuit corresponds
to a mathematically natural prop. We describe the "behavior" of these circuits using morphisms
between props. In particular, we give a new proof of the black-boxing theorem proved by Fong and the
first author; unlike the original proof, this new one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear
components. We also use a morphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and
the signal-flow diagrams in control theory. Technically, the key tools are the Rosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters
result relating circuits to special commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between
props and signatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to
props.
