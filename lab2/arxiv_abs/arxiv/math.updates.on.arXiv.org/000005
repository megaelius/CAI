Training-based transmission over Rayleigh block-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
channels is investigated. As a training method a combination of a pilot-assisted scheme and a biased
signaling scheme is considered. The achievable rates of successive decoding (SD) receivers based
on the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation are analyzed in the large-system
limit, by using the replica method under the assumption of replica symmetry. It is shown that negligible
pilot information is best in terms of the achievable rates of the SD receivers in the large-system
limit. The obtained analytical formulas of the achievable rates can improve the existing lower
bound on the capacity of the MIMO channel with no channel state information (CSI), derived by Hassibi
and Hochwald, for all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The comparison between the obtained bound
and a high SNR approximation of the channel capacity, derived by Zheng and Tse, implies that the high
SNR approximation is unreliable unless quite high SNR is considered. Energy efficiency in the low
SNR regime is also investigated in terms of the power per information bit required for reliable communication.
The required minimum power is shown to be achieved at a positive rate for the SD receiver with no CSI,
whereas it is achieved in the zero-rate limit for the case of perfect CSI available at the receiver.
Moreover, numerical simulations imply that the presented large-system analysis can provide a
good approximation for not so large systems. The results in this paper imply that SD schemes can provide
a significant performance gain in the low-to-moderate SNR regimes, compared to conventional receivers
based on one-shot channel estimation.
