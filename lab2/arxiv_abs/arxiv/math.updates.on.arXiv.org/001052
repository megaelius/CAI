We give new constructions of two classes of algebraic code families which are efficiently list decodable
with small output list size from a fraction $1-R-\epsilon$ of adversarial errors where $R$ is the
rate of the code, for any desired positive constant $\epsilon$. The alphabet size depends only $\epsilon$
and is nearly-optimal. The first class of codes are obtained by folding algebraic-geometric codes
using automorphisms of the underlying function field. The list decoding algorithm is based on a
linear-algebraic approach, which pins down the candidate messages to a subspace with a nice "periodic"
structure. The list is pruned by precoding into a special form of "subspace-evasive" sets, which
are constructed pseudorandomly. Instantiating this construction with the Garcia-Stichtenoth
function field tower yields codes list-decodable up to a $1-R-\epsilon$ error fraction with list
size bounded by $O(1/\epsilon)$, matching the existential bound up to constant factors. The parameters
we achieve are thus quite close to the existential bounds in all three aspects: error-correction
radius, alphabet size, and list-size. The second class of codes are obtained by restricting evaluation
points of an algebraic-geometric code to rational points from a subfield. Once again, the linear-algebraic
approach to list decoding to pin down candidate messages to a periodic subspace. We develop an alternate
approach based on "subspace designs" to precode messages. Together with the subsequent explicit
constructions of subspace designs, this yields a deterministic construction of an algebraic code
family of rate $R$ with efficient list decoding from $1-R-\epsilon$ fraction of errors over a constant-sized
alphabet. The list size is bounded by a very slowly growing function of the block length $N$; in particular,
it is at most $O(\log^{(r)} N)$ (the $r$'th iterated logarithm) for any fixed integer $r$.
