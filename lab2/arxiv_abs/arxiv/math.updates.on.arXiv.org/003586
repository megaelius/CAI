We prove that every finite symmetric integral tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ with the Chevalley
property over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>2$ admits a symmetric fiber
functor to $\text{sVec}$. This proves Ostrik's conjecture \cite[Conjecture 1.3]{o} in this case.
Equivalently, we prove that there exists a unique finite supergroup scheme $\mathcal{G}$ over
$k$ and a grouplike element $\epsilon\in k[\mathcal{G}]$ of order $\le 2$, whose action by conjugation
on $\mathcal{G}$ coincides with the parity automorphism of $\mathcal{G}$, such that $\mathcal{C}$
is symmetric tensor equivalent to $\Rep(\mathcal{G},\epsilon)$. In particular, when $\mathcal{C}$
is unipotent, the functor lands in $\Vect$, so $\mathcal{C}$ is symmetric tensor equivalent to
$\Rep(U)$ for a unique finite unipotent group scheme $U$ over $k$. We apply our result and the results
of \cite{g} to classify certain finite dimensional triangular Hopf algebras with the Chevalley
property over $k$ (e.g., local), in group scheme-theoretical terms. Finally, we compute the Sweedler
cohomology of restricted enveloping algebras over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic
$p>0$, classify associators for their duals, and study finite dimensional (not necessarily triangular)
local quasi-Hopf algebras and finite (not necessarily symmetric) unipotent tensor categories
over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$. The appendix by K. Coulembier and
P. Etingof gives another proof of the above classification results using the recent paper \cite{Co},
and, more generally, shows that the maximal Tannakian and super-Tannakian subcategory of a symmetric
tensor category over a field of characteristic $\ne 2$ is always a Serre subcategory.
