In this paper we present a new modelling framework combining replicator dynamics (which is the standard
model of frequency dependent selection) with the model of an age-structured population. The new
framework allows for the modelling of populations consisting of competing strategies carried
by individuals who change across their life cycle. Firstly the discretization of the McKendrick
von Foerster model is derived. It is shown that the Euler--Lotka equation is satisfied when the new
model reaches a steady state (i.e. stable frequencies between the age classes). This discretization
consists of the unit age classes and the timescale is chosen that only a fraction of individuals play
single game round. This implies linear dynamics within single time unit when individuals not killed
during game round are moved from one age class to another. Since its local linear behaviour the system
is equivalent to large Bernadelli-Lewis-Leslie matrix. Then the methodology of multipopulation
games is used for the derivation of two, mutually equivalent systems of equations. The first contains
equations describing the evolution of the strategy frequencies in the whole population completed
by subsystems of equations describing the evolution of the age structure for each strategy. The
second system contains equations describing the changes of the general population's age structure,
completed with subsystems of equations describing the selection of the strategies within each
age class. Then the obtained system of replicator dynamics is presented in the form of the mixed ODE-PDE
system. The obtained results are illustrated by example of the sex ratio model which shows that when
different mortalities of both sexes are assumed, the sex ratio of 0.5 is obtained but that Fisher's
mechanism driven by the reproductive value of the different sexes is not in equilibrium.
