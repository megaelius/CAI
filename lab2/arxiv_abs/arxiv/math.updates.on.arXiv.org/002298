Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a nonnegative symmetric or combinatorial symmetric weakly irreducible tensor
of order $m$. It is known that the spectral radius $\rho(\mathcal{A})$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathcal{A}$
corresponding to a unique positive eigenvector up to a scalar (called the Perron vector). Let $\mathbb{V}_{\rho(\mathcal{A})}$
be the projective eigenvariety of $\mathcal{A}$ associated with $\rho(\mathcal{A})$, i.e. the
set of the eigenvectors of $\mathcal{A}$ corresponding to $\rho(\mathcal{A})$ considered in
the complex projective space. We proved that $\mathbb{V}_{\rho(\mathcal{A})}$ admits a $\mathbb{Z}_m$-module
structure, which is determined by the support of $\mathcal{A}$ and can be characterized explicitly
by solving the Smith normal form of the incidence matrix of $\mathcal{A}$. Consequently, we showed
that the dimension of $\mathbb{V}_{\rho(\mathcal{A})}$ is zero, i.e. there are a finite number
of eigenvectors of $\mathcal{A}$ corresponding to $\rho(\mathcal{A})$ up to a scalar. We introduced
two parameters: the stabilizing index $s(\mathcal{A})$ and the stabilizing dimension $\gamma(\mathcal{A})$
of $\mathcal{A}$, where the former is exactly the cardinality of $\mathbb{V}_{\rho(\mathcal{A})}$
and the latter is the composition length of the $\mathbb{V}_{\rho(\mathcal{A})}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}_m$-module.
We give some upper bounds for $s(\mathcal{A})$ and $\gamma(\mathcal{A})$, and characterize the
case of $s(\mathcal{A})=1$ or $\gamma(\mathcal{A})=0$, or equivalently there is only one eigenvector
corresponding to $\rho(\mathcal{A})$, i.e. the Perron vector. By applying the above results to
the adjacency tensor $\mathcal{A}(G)$ of a connected uniform hypergraph $G$, we give some upper
bounds for $s(\mathcal{A}(G))$ and $\gamma(\mathcal{A}(G))$ in terms of the structural parameters
of $G$.
