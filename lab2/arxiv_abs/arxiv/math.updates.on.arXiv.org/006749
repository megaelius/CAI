This paper studies the statistical and computational limits of high-order clustering with planted
structures. We focus on two clustering models, constant high-order clustering (CHC) and rank-one
higher-order clustering (ROHC), and study the methods and theories for testing whether a cluster
exists (detection) and identifying the support of cluster (recovery). Specifically, we identify
sharp boundaries of signal-to-noise ratio for which CHC and ROHC detection/recovery are statistically
possible. We also develop tight computational thresholds: when the signal-to-noise ratio is below
these thresholds, we prove that polynomial-time algorithms cannot solve these problems under
the computational hardness conjectures of hypergraphic planted clique (HPC) detection and hypergraphic
planted dense subgraph (HPDS) recovery. We also propose polynomial-time tensor algorithms that
achieve reliable detection and recovery when the signal-to-noise ratio is above these thresholds.
Both sparsity and tensor structures yield the computational barriers in high-order tensor clustering.
The interplay between them results in significant differences between high-order tensor clustering
and matrix clustering in literature in aspects of statistical and computational phase transition
diagrams, algorithmic approaches, hardness conjecture, and proof techniques. To our best knowledge,
we are the first to give a thorough characterization of the statistical and computational trade-off
for such a double computational-barrier problem. In addition, we also provide evidence for the
computational hardness conjectures of HPC detection and HPDS recovery.
