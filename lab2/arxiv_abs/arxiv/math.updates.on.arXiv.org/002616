This paper studies the fundamental limits of content delivery in a cache-aided broadcast network
for correlated content generated by a discrete memoryless source with arbitrary joint distribution.
Each receiver is equipped with a cache of equal capacity, and the requested files are delivered over
a shared error-free broadcast link. A class of achievable correlation-aware schemes based on a
two-step source coding approach is proposed. Library files are first compressed, and then cached
and delivered using a combination of correlation-unaware multiple-request cache-aided coded
multicast schemes. The first step uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via private
descriptions and descriptions that are common to more than one file. The second step then becomes
a multiple-request caching problem, where the demand structure is dictated by the configuration
of the compressed library, and it is interesting in its own right. The performance of the proposed
two-step scheme is evaluated by comparing its achievable rate with a lower bound on the optimal peak
and average rate-memory tradeoffs in a two-file multiple-receiver network, and in a three-file
two-receiver network. Specifically, in a network with two files and two receivers, the achievable
rate matches the lower bound for a significant memory regime and it is within half of the conditional
entropy of files for all other memory values. In the three-file two-receiver network, the two-step
strategy achieves the lower bound for large cache capacities, and it is within half of the joint entropy
of two of the sources conditioned on the third one for all other cache sizes.
