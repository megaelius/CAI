The principal goal of the paper is to apply the approach inspired by the theory of integrable systems
to construct explicit sections of line bundles over the combinatorial model of the moduli space
of pointed Riemann surfaces based on Jenkins-Strebel differentials. The line bundles are tensor
products of the determinants of the Hodge or Prym vector bundles with the standard tautological
line bundles $\mathcal L_j$ and the sections are constructed in terms of tau functions. The combinatorial
model is interpreted as the real slice of a complex analytic moduli space of quadratic differentials
where the phase of each tau-function provides a section of a circle bundle. The phase of the ratio
of the Prym and Hodge tau functions gives a section of the $\kappa_1$-circle bundle. By evaluating
the increment of the phase around co-dimension $2$ sub-complexes, we identify the Poincar\'e\
dual cycles to the Chern classes of the corresponding line bundles: they are expressed explicitly
as combination of Witten's cycle $W_5$ and Kontsevich's boundary. This provides combinatorial
analogues of Mumford's relations on $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ and Penner's relations in the hyperbolic
combinatorial model. The free homotopy classes of loops around $W_5$ are interpreted as pentagon
moves while those of loops around Kontsevich's boundary as combinatorial Dehn twists. Throughout
the paper we exploit the classical description of the combinatorial model in terms of Jenkins--Strebel
differentials, parametrized in terms of {\it homological coordinates}; we also show that they
provide Darboux coordinates for the symplectic structure introduced by Kontsevich. We also express
the latter in clear geometric terms as the intersection pairing in the odd homology of the canonical
double cover.
