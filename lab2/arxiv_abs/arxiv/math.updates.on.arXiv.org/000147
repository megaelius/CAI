It is known that there is a close analogy between "Euclidean t-designs vs. spherical t-designs"
and "Relative t-designs in binary Hamming association schemes vs. combinatorial t-designs".
In this paper, we want to prove how much we can develop a similar theory in the latter situation, imitating
the theory in the former one. We first prove that the weight function is constant on each shell for
tight relative t-designs on p shells on a wide class of Q-polynomial association schemes, including
Hamming association schemes. In the theory of Euclidean t-designs on 2 concentric spheres (shells),
it is known that the structure of coherent configurations is naturally attached. However, it seems
difficult to prove this claim in a general context. In the case of tight 2-designs in combinatorial
2-designs, there are great many tight 2-designs, i.e., symmetric 2-designs, while there are very
few tight 2e-designs for e no less than 2. So, as a starting point, we concentrate our study to the existence
problem of tight relative 2-designs, in particular on 2 shells, in binary Hamming association schemes
H(n,2). We prove that every tight relative 2-designs on 2 shells in H(n,2) has the structure of coherent
configuration. We determined all the possible parameters of coherent configurations attached
to such tight relative 2-designs for n at most 30. Moreover for each of them we determined whether
there exists such a tight relative 2-design or not, either by constructing them from symmetric 2-designs
or Hadamard matrices, or theoretically showing the non-existence. In particular, we show that
for n congruent to 6 (mod 8), there exist such tight relative 2-designs whose weight functions are
not constant. These are the first examples of those with non-constant weight.
