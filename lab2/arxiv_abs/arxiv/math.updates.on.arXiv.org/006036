Distributed delays modeled by 'weak generic kernels' are introduced in the well-known coupled
Landau-Stuart system, as well as a chaotic van der Pol-Rayleigh system with parametric forcing.
The systems are close via the 'linear chain trick'. Linear stability analysis of the systems and
conditions for Hopf bifurcation which initiates oscillations are investigated, including deriving
the normal form at bifurcation, and deducing the stability of the resulting limit cycle attractor.
The value of the delay parameter $a=a_{Hopf}$ at Hopf bifurcation picks out the onset of Amplitude
Death(AD) in all three systems, with oscillations at larger values (corresponding to weaker delay).
In the Landau-Stuart system, the Hopf-generated limit cycles for $a>a_{Hopf}$ turn out to be remarkably
stable under very large variations of all other system parameters beyond the Hopf bifurcation point,
and do not undergo further symmetry breaking, cyclic-fold, flip, transcritical or Neimark-Sacker
bifurcations. This is to be expected as the corresponding undelayed systems are robust oscillators
over wide ranges of their respective parameters. Numerical simulations reveal strong distortion
and rotation of the limit cycles in phase space as the parameters are pushed far into the post-Hopf
regime, and reveal other features, such as how the oscillation amplitudes and time periods of the
physical variables on the limit cycle attractor change as the delay and other parameters are varied.
For the chaotic system, very strong delays may still lead to the cessation of oscillations and the
onset of AD (even for relatively large values of the system forcing which tends to oppose this phenomenon).
Varying of the other important system parameter, the parametric excitation, leads to a rich sequence
of dynamical behaviors, with the bifurcations leading from one regime (or type of attractor) into
the next being carefully tracked.
