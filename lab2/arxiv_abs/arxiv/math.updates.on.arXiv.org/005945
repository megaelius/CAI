In this article we present a novel staggered semi-implicit hybrid finite-volume/finite-element
(FV/FE) method for the resolution of weakly compressible flows in two and three space dimensions.
The pressure-based methodology introduced in Berm\'udez et al. 2014 and Busto et al. 2018 for viscous
incompressible flows is extended here to solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Instead
of considering the classical system including the energy conservation equation, we replace it
by the pressure evolution equation written in non-conservative form. To ease the discretization
of complex spatial domains, face-type unstructured staggered meshes are considered. A projection
method allows the decoupling of the computation of the density and linear momentum variables from
the pressure. Then, an explicit finite volume scheme is used for the resolution of the transport
diffusion equations on the dual mesh, whereas the pressure system is solved implicitly by using
continuous finite elements defined on the primal simplex mesh. Consequently, the CFL stability
condition depends only on the flow velocity, avoiding the severe time restrictions that might be
imposed by the sound velocity in the weakly compressible regime. High order of accuracy in space
and time of the transport diffusion stage is attained using a local ADER (LADER) methodology. Moreover,
also the CVC Kolgan-type second order in space and first order in time scheme is considered. To prevent
spurious oscillations in the presence of shocks, an ENO-based reconstruction, the minmod limiter
or the Barth-Jespersen limiter are employed. To show the validity and robustness of our novel staggered
semi-implicit hybrid FV/FE scheme, several benchmarks are analysed, showing a good agreement
with available exact solutions and numerical reference data from low Mach numbers, up to Mach numbers
of the order of unity.
