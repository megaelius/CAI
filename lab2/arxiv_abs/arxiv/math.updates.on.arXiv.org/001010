In this work, we propose a generalized multiscale inversion algorithm for heterogeneous problems
that aims at solving an inverse problem on a computational coarse grid. Previous inversion techniques
for multiscale problems seek a coarse-grid media properties, e.g., permeability and conductivity,
and by doing so, they assume that there exists a homogenized representation of the underlying fine-scale
permeability field on a coarse grid. Generally such assumptions do not hold for highly heterogeneous
fields, e.g., fracture media or channelized fields, where the width of channels are very small compared
to the coarse-grid sizes. In these cases, grid refinement can lead to many degrees of freedom, and
thus unattractive to apply. The proposed algorithm is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite
Element Method (GMsFEM), which uses local spectral problems to identify non-localized features,
i.e., channels (high-conductivity inclusions that connect the boundaries of the coarse-grid
block). The inclusion of these features in the coarse space enables one to achieve a good accuracy.
The approach is valid under the assumption that the solution can be well represented in a reduced-dimensional
space by multiscale basis functions. In practice, these basis functions are non-observable as
we do not identify the fine-scale features of the permeability field. Our inversion algorithm finds
the discretization parameters of the resulting system. By doing so, we identify the appropriate
coarse-grid parameters representing the permeability field instead of fine-grid permeability
field. We illustrate the approach by numerical results for fractured media.
