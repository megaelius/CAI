Procedures relying on infinitesimals in Leibniz, Euler and Cauchy have been interpreted in both
a Weierstrassian and Robinson's frameworks. The latter provides closer proxies for the procedures
of the classical masters. Thus, Leibniz's distinction between assignable and inassignable numbers
finds a proxy in the distinction between standard and nonstandard numbers in Robinson's framework,
while Leibniz's law of homogeneity with the implied notion of equality up to negligible terms finds
a mathematical formalisation in terms of standard part. It is hard to provide parallel formalisations
in a Weierstrassian framework but scholars since Ishiguro have engaged in a quest for ghosts of departed
quantifiers to provide a Weierstrassian account for Leibniz's infinitesimals. Euler similarly
had notions of equality up to negligible terms, of which he distinguished two types: geometric and
arithmetic. Euler routinely used product decompositions into a specific infinite number of factors,
and used the binomial formula with an infinite exponent. Such procedures have immediate hyperfinite
analogues in Robinson's framework, while in a Weierstrassian framework they can only be reinterpreted
by means of paraphrases departing significantly from Euler's own presentation. Cauchy gives lucid
definitions of continuity in terms of infinitesimals that find ready formalisations in Robinson's
framework but scholars working in a Weierstrassian framework bend over backwards either to claim
that Cauchy was vague or to engage in a quest for ghosts of departed quantifiers in his work. Cauchy's
procedures in the context of his 1853 sum theorem (for series of continuous functions) are more readily
understood from the viewpoint of Robinson's framework, where one can exploit tools such as the pointwise
definition of the concept of uniform convergence. Keywords: historiography; infinitesimal;
