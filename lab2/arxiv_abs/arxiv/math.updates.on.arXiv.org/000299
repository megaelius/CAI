In this paper, we develop a new variational method with the Structural Prescribed Boundary Conditions
(SPBC) to prove the existence of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions for planar four-body problem
with $m_1=m_3$ and $m_2=m_4$. Given a rotation angle $\theta\in (0,2\pi)$ and mass ratio $\mu=\frac{m_2}{m_1}\in
\mathbf{R}^+$, a path $q(t)$ satisfies SPBC if the boundaries $q(0)=[0, -a_3; -a_1, a_2; 0, -2\mu
a_2+a_3; a_1, a_2 ] R(\theta),$ and $ q(T)=[ a_4, a_5;0, -a_6; -a_4, a_5; 0, -\frac{2}{\mu}a_5+a_6]
$, where $R(\theta)=[\cos(\theta), -\sin(\theta); \sin(\theta), \cos(\theta)]$ and $(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_6)\in
\mathbf{R}^6$. We show that there is a region $\Omega\subseteq (0,2\pi)\times R^+$ such that there
exists at least one local minimizer of the Lagrangian action functional on the path space satisfying
SPBC for any $(\theta,\mu)\in \Omega$. The corresponding minimizing path of the minimizer can
be extended to a non-homographic periodic solution if $\theta$ is commensurable with $\pi$ or a
quasi-periodic solution if $\theta$ is not commensurable with $\pi$. Among the many stable simple
choreographic orbits, the most extraordinary one is the stable star pentagon choreographic solution
when $(\theta,\mu)=(\frac{4\pi}{5},1)$. Remarkably the unequal-mass variants of the stable
star pentagon is just as stable as the basic equal mass choreography. Each type of periodic solutions
has many stable solutions and possibly infinitely many stable solutions. We conjecture that all
periodic solutions extended by the minimizing path with SPBC are linearly stable if $(\theta,\mu)$
is in the region $\Omega$. Our variational method with SPBC largely complement the current variational
methods by minimizing the action on a loop space with some topological or geometric constrains.
