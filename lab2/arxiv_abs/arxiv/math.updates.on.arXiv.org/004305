Hidden information emerges under impulse interactions with Markov diffusion process modeling
interactive random environment. Impulse yes no action cuts Markov correlations revealing Bit
of hidden information connected correlated states. Information appears phenomenon of interaction
cutting correlations carrying entropy. Each inter action models Kronicker impulse, delta impulse
models interaction between the Kronicker impulses. Each impulse step down action cuts maximum
of impulse minimal entropy and impulse step up action transits cutting minimal entropy to each step
up action of merging delta function. Delta step down action kills delivering entropy producing
equivalent minimax information. The merging action initiates quantum microprocess. Multiple
cutting entropy is converting to information micro macroprocess. Cutting impulse entropy integrates
entropy functional EF along trajectories of multidimensional diffusion process. Information
which delivers ending states of each impulse integrates information path functional IPF along
process trajectories. Hidden information evaluates Feller kernel whose minimal path transforms
Markov transition probability to probability of Brownian diffusion. Each transitive transformation
virtually observes origin of hidden information probabilities correlated states. IPF integrates
observing Bits along minimal path assembling information Observer. Minimax imposes variation
principle on EF and IPF whose extreme equations describe observing micro and macroprocess which
describes irreversible thermodynamics. Hidden information curries free information frozen
from correlated connections. Free information binds observing micro macro processes in information
macrodynamics. Each dynamic three free information composes triplet structures. Three structural
triplets assemble information network. Triple networks free information cooperate information
Observer.
