Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) employ electroactive bacteria to perform extracellular
electron transfer, enabling hydrogen generation from biodegradable substrates. In previous
work, we developed and analyzed a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model for MECs. The model
resembles a chemostat with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for concentrations of substrate,
microorganisms, and an extracellular mediator involved in electron transfer. There is also an
algebraic constraint for electric current and hydrogen production. Our goal is to determine the
outcome of competition between methanogenic archaea and electroactive bacteria, because only
the latter contribute to electric current and resulting hydrogen production. We investigate asymptotic
stability in two industrially relevant versions of the model. An important aspect of chemostats
models is the principle of competitive exclusion -- only microbes which grow at the lowest substrate
concentration will survive as $t\to\infty$. We show that if methanogens grow at the lowest substrate
concentration, then the equilibrium corresponding to competitive exclusion by methanogens is
globally asymptotically stable. The analogous result for electroactive bacteria is not necessarily
true. We show that local asymptotic stability of exclusion by electroactive bacteria is not guaranteed,
even in a simplified version of the model. In this case, even if electroactive bacteria can grow at
the lowest substrate concentration, a few additional conditions are required to guarantee local
asymptotic stability. We also provide numerical simulations supporting these arguments. Our
results suggest operating conditions that are most conducive to success of electroactive bacteria
and the resulting current and hydrogen production in MECs. This will help identify when methane
production or electricity and hydrogen production are favored.
