Consider a channel where authorized transmitter Jack sends packets to authorized receiver Steve
according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ packets per second for a time period $T$. Suppose
that covert transmitter Alice wishes to communicate information to covert receiver Bob on the same
channel without being detected by a watchful adversary Willie. We consider two scenarios. In the
first scenario, we assume that warden Willie cannot look at packet contents but rather can only observe
packet timings, and Alice must send information by inserting her own packets into the channel. We
show that the number of packets that Alice can covertly transmit to Bob is on the order of the square
root of the number of packets that Jack transmits to Steve; conversely, if Alice transmits more than
that, she will be detected by Willie with high probability. In the second scenario, we assume that
Willie can look at packet contents but that Alice can communicate across an $M/M/1$ queue to Bob by
altering the timings of the packets going from Jack to Steve. First, Alice builds a codebook, with
each codeword consisting of a sequence of packet timings to be employed for conveying the information
associated with that codeword. However, to successfully employ this codebook, Alice must always
have a packet to send at the appropriate time. Hence, leveraging our result from the first scenario,
we propose a construction where Alice covertly slows down the packet stream so as to buffer packets
to use during a succeeding codeword transmission phase. Using this approach, Alice can covertly
and reliably transmit $\mathcal{O}(\lambda T)$ covert bits to Bob in time period $T$ over an $M/M/1$
queue with service rate $\mu > \lambda$.
