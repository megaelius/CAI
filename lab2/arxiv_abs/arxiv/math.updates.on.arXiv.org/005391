For $1\le t < \infty$, a compact subset $K\subset\mathbb C$, and a finite positive measure $\mu$
supported on $K$, $R^t(K, \mu)$ denotes the closure in $L^t(\mu)$ of rational functions with poles
off $K$. Let $\text{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu))$ denote the set of analytic bounded point evaluations.
The purpose of this paper is to describe the structure of $R^t(K, \mu)$. In the work of Thomson on describing
the closure in $L^t(\mu)$ of analytic polynomials, $P^t(\mu)$, the existence of analytic bounded
point evaluations plays critical roles, while $\text{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu))$ may be empty. We introduce
the concept of non-removable boundary $\mathcal F$ such that the removable set $\mathcal R = K\setminus
\mathcal F$ contains $\text{abpe}(R^t(K, \mu))$. Recent remarkable developments in analytic
capacity and Cauchy transform provide us the necessary tools to describe $\mathcal F$ and obtain
structural results for $R^t(K, \mu)$. Assume that $R^t(K, \mu)$ does not have a direct $L^t$ summand.
Let $H^\infty_{\mathcal R}(\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R})$ be the weak$^*$ closure in $L^\infty
(\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R})$ of the functions that are bounded analytic off compact subsets of
$\mathcal F$, where $\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R}$ denotes the planar Lebesgue measure restricted
to $\mathcal R$. We prove that there is an isometric isomorphism and a weak$^*$ homeomorphism from
$R^t(K, \mu)\cap L^\infty(\mu )$ onto $H^\infty_{\mathcal R}(\mathcal L^2_{\mathcal R })$.
Consequently, we show that a decomposition theorem (Main Theorem II) of $R^t(K, \mu)$ holds for
an arbitrary compact subset $K$ and finite positive measure $\mu$ supported on $K$, which extends
the central results regarding $P^t(\mu)$.
