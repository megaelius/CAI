Governments across the world are planning to increase the share of renewables in their energy systems.
The siting of new wind and solar power plants requires close coordination with grid planning, and
hence co-optimization of investment in generation and transmission expansion in spatially and
temporally resolved models is an indispensable but complex problem. Particularly considerations
of transmission expansion planning (TEP) add to the problem's complexity. Even if the power flow
equations are linearized, the optimization problem is still bilinear and mixed-integer due to
the dependence of line expansion on line impedance and a discrete set of line expansion options.
While it is possible to linearize this mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) by applying a big-M
disjunctive relaxation, the resulting MILP is still hard to solve using state-of-the-art solvers
for large-scale energy system models. In this paper we therefore develop heuristics to incorporate
integer transmission expansion and responsive line impedances in energy system models, while
retaining the lower computational effort of continuous linear programming (LP) by applying sequential
linear programming (SLP) techniques, relaxation and discretization approaches. We benchmark
their performance against the results of the exact formulation for a policy-relevant case study
of the German transmission system in terms of their speed-up in computation time, deviation from
optimal total system cost, and similarity of line expansion. Using heuristics we reduce computation
times of joint generation and transmission optimisation by 82% with a maximal total system cost
deviation of only 1.5%. The heuristics closely mirror optimal integer line investment of the exact
MINLP with considerable time savings for policy-relevant low-carbon energy system optimization
models.
