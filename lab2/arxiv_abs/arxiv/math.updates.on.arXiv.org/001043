Examples complete our trilogy on the geometric and combinatorial characterization of global Sturm
attractors $\mathcal{A}$ which consist of a single closed 3-ball. The underlying scalar PDE is
parabolic, $$ u_t = u_{xx} + f(x,u,u_x)\,, $$ on the unit interval $0 < x<1$ with Neumann boundary
conditions. Equilibria $v_t=0$ are assumed to be hyperbolic. Geometrically, we study the resulting
Thom-Smale dynamic complex with cells defined by the fast unstable manifolds of the equilibria.
The Thom-Smale complex turns out to be a regular cell complex. In the first two papers we characterized
3-ball Sturm attractors $\mathcal{A}$ as 3-cell templates $\mathcal{C}$. The characterization
involves bipolar orientations and hemisphere decompositions which are closely related to the
geometry of the fast unstable manifolds. An equivalent combinatorial description was given in
terms of the Sturm permutation, alias the meander properties of the shooting curve for the equilibrium
ODE boundary value problem. It involves the relative positioning of extreme 2-dimensionally unstable
equilibria at the Neumann boundaries $x=0$ and $x=1$, respectively, and the overlapping reach
of polar serpents in the shooting meander. In the present paper we apply these descriptions to explicitly
enumerate all 3-ball Sturm attractors $\mathcal{A}$ with at most 13 equilibria. We also give complete
lists of all possibilities to obtain solid tetrahedra, cubes, and octahedra as 3-ball Sturm attractors
with 15 and 27 equilibria, respectively. For the remaining Platonic 3-balls, icosahedra and dodecahedra,
we indicate a reduction to mere planar considerations as discussed in our previous trilogy on planar
Sturm attractors.
