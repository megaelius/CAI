This paper presents new methods for ensuring that the energy system of a neighborhood that is designed
with the objective of being zero emission is actually operated in a way that allows it to reach net
zero emissions in its lifetime. This paper highlights the necessity of taking into account realistic
operation strategies when designing the energy system of such neighborhoods. It also suggests
methods that can be used in the operation of ZENs to ensure carbon neutrality. An optimization model
for designing the energy system of a Zero Emission Neighborhood (ZEN) is first presented and used
to produce two designs for a campus in the South of Norway in the case where the amount of PV is limited
(PVlim) and when it is not (Base). Several operation approaches are then introduced to compare their
operation cost and the CO2 emissions and compensations. These approaches are perfect foresight
used as a reference (Ref.),a purely economic model predictive control (E-MPC), an MPC with penalization
if deviating from emission targets (EmE-MPC)and a receding horizon MPC where we have a net zero emission
constraint over the year (RH-MPC). The resulting energy systems are, in the Base case, PV, heat pumps,
a gas boiler and heat storage and, in the PVlim case, a smaller amount of PV, a CHP plant, and heat storage.
In the Base case all operation strategies manage to reach net zero emissions, largely due to the passive
compensations obtained from the PV. RH-MPC offers the lowest cost. In the PVlim case, the passive
effect of the PV is not sufficient to reach net zero emissions and an operation approach specifically
taking into account the emissions is necessary. EmE-MPC achieves the lowest emissions but it comes
at a much higher cost. We conclude that the best overall strategy is RH-MPC which maintains both the
cost and the emission-compensation balance close to the reference case with perfect foresight.
