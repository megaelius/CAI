Despite the wide range of possible scenarios in the aftermath of a disruptive event, each community
can make choices to improve its resilience, or its ability to bounce back. A resilient community
is one that has prepared for, and can thus absorb, recover from, and adapt to the disruptive event.
One important aspect of the recovery phase is assessing the extent of the damage in the built environment
through post-event building inspections. In this paper, we develop and demonstrate a resilience-based
methodology intended to support rapid post-event decision-making about inspection priorities
with limited information. The method uses the basic characteristics of the building stock in a community
(floor area, number of stories, type of construction and configuration) to assign structure-specific
fragility functions to each building. For an event with a given seismic intensity, the probability
of each building reaching a particular damage state is determined, and is used to predict the actual
building states and priorities for inspection. Losses are computed based on building usage category,
estimated inspection costs, the consequences of erroneous decisions, and the potential for unnecessary
restrictions in access. The aim is to provide a means for a community to make rapid cost-based decisions
related to inspection of their building inventory. We pose the decision problem as an integer optimization
problem that attempts to minimize the expected loss to the community. The advantages of this approach
are that it: (i) is simple, (ii) requires minimal inventory data, (iii) is easily scalable, and (iv)
does not require significant computing power. Use of this approach before the hazard event can also
provide a community with the means to plan and allocate resources in advance of an event to achieve
the desirable resiliency goals of the community.
