An irreducible weight module of an affine Kac-Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is called dense if its
support is equal to a coset in $\mathfrak{h}^{*}/Q$. Following a conjecture of V. Futorny about
affine Kac-Moody algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, an irreducible weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module is dense
if and only if it is cuspidal (i.e. not a quotient of an induced module). The conjecture is confirmed
for $\mathfrak{g}=A_{2}^{\left(1\right)}$, $A_{2}^{\left(2\right)}$, $A_{3}^{\left(1\right)}$
and $A_{4}^{\left(1\right)}$ and a classification of the supports of the irreducible weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules
obtained. A new category of hypoabelian subalgebras, pre-prosolvable subalgebras, and a subclass
thereof, quasicone subalgebras, is introduced and its objects classified. The action of a root
operators is identified with a tropical matrix action on the tropical matrix algebra $\mathfrak{g}=A_{n}^{\left(1\right)}$
of quasicone subalgebras, $\left(n>2\right)$. For all $A_{n}^{\left(1\right)}$ the problem
is reduced to finding primitive elements for only finitely many cases, all lying below a certain
bound. This lower bound in the lattice of quasicone subalgebras is given explicitely. For the finite
set of quasicone subalgebras where no strategy leads to a primitive element by the general theorem
(i.e. below that bound), strategies that yield primitive elements (called successful strategies)
are computed explicitely. The algorithm computes successful strategies by exploiting a search
forest and is successfully implemented (in Python). This algorithm leads to the solution of Futorny's
conjecture for the cases $A_{2}^{\left(1\right)}$ and $A_{3}^{\left(1\right)}$. The solution
of the case $A_{4}^{\left(1\right)}$ required additional combinatorics.
