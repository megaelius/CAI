Multi-leader multi-follower games are a class of hierarchical games in which a collection of leaders
compete in a Nash game constrained by the equilibrium conditions of another Nash game amongst the
followers. The resulting equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints is complicated by
nonconvex agent problems and therefore providing tractable conditions for existence of global
or even local equilibria for it has proved challenging. Consequently, much of the extant research
on this topic is either model specific or relies on weaker notions of equilibria. We consider a modified
formulation in which every leader is cognizant of the equilibrium constraints of all leaders. Equilibria
of this modified game contain the equilibria, if any, of the original game. The new formulation has
a constraint structure called shared constraints, and our main result shows that if the leader objectives
admit a potential function, the global minimizers of the potential function over the shared constraint
are equilibria of the modified formulation. We provide another existence result using fixed point
theory that does not require potentiality. Additionally, local minima, B-stationary, and strong-stationary
points of this minimization are shown to be local Nash equilibria, Nash B-stationary, and Nash strong-stationary
points of the corresponding multi-leader multi-follower game. We demonstrate the relationship
between variational equilibria associated with this modified shared-constraint game and equilibria
of the original game from the standpoint of the multiplier sets and show how equilibria of the original
formulation may be recovered. We note through several examples that such potential multi-leader
multi-follower games capture a breadth of application problems of interest and demonstrate our
findings on a multi-leader multi-follower Cournot game.
