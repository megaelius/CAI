The purpose of this article is to investigate a century old problem in classical analysis: when the
Riemann map $\varphi$ of a simply connected domain $G$ can extend continuously to $\bar G$\ ? A Jordan
arc is the image of an 1-1 continuous function on $[0,1]$. Let $G$ be a simply connected domain, $\lambda\in
\partial G$ is called an accessible point of $ G$ if there is a Jordan arc $J$ such that $J\subset \bar
G$ and $J\cap\partial G=\{\lambda\}$. Let $\partial_{a} G$ denote the set of accessible points
of $G$ and let $\partial_{n}G-\partial G=\partial_{a}G$. A crosscut of $G$ is a Jordan arc contained
in $ G$ except its end points. We call a point $\lambda\in \partial G$ semi-unreachable if there is
a crosscut $J$ of $G$ such that $\lambda \subset \partial U -\partial_{a}U $ for one of the components
$U$ of $ G-J$. Let $\partial_{sa}G$ denote the set of semi-unreachable points of $G$. Set $\partial_{pa}G=\partial_{a}G-\partial_{sa}G$
and the points in $\partial_{pa}G$ are called purely accessible. In this paper, the author shows
that the Riemann map of $G$ extends continuously to $\bar G$ if and only if the following hold: \noindent
1) every point in $\partial_{a} G$ is purely accessible; \noindent 2) for $a\in\partial_{a}G$
and domains $U&V\subset G$, if $a\in\partial_{a}U\cap\partial_{a}V$, then $U\cap V\neq\emptyset$;
\noindent 3) for $a\in \partial_{n} G$, if $ J_{i}$ is a crosscut of $G$ such that $a\in\partial_{n}U_{i}$
for one of the components $U_{i}$ of $G-J_{i}$, $i=1,2$, then $U_{1}\cap U_{2}\neq\emptyset$.
The results in the paper cover a famous theorem proved by C. Carathe\"{o}dory in 1913, which says
that if $G$ is a Jordan domain, then the Riemann map is a homeomorphism from $\bar G$ to $\bar D$.
