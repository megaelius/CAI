The discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSSs) are a set of orthonormal sequences in $\ell_2(\mathbb{Z})$
which are strictly bandlimited to a frequency band $[-W,W]$ and maximally concentrated in a time
interval $\{0,\ldots,N-1\}$. The timelimited DPSSs (sometimes referred to as the Slepian basis)
are an orthonormal set of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^N$ whose discrete time Fourier transform (DTFT)
is maximally concentrated in a frequency band $[-W,W]$. Due to these properties, DPSSs have a wide
variety of signal processing applications. The DPSSs are the eigensequences of a timelimit-then-bandlimit
operator and the Slepian basis vectors are the eigenvectors of the so-called prolate matrix. The
eigenvalues in both cases are the same, and they exhibit a particular clustering behavior -- slightly
fewer than $2NW$ eigenvalues are very close to $1$, slightly fewer than $N-2NW$ eigenvalues are
very close to $0$, and very few eigenvalues are not near $1$ or $0$. This eigenvalue behavior is critical
in many of the applications in which DPSSs are used. There are many asymptotic characterizations
of the number of eigenvalues not near $0$ or $1$. In contrast, there are very few non-asymptotic results,
and these don't fully characterize the clustering behavior of the DPSS eigenvalues. In this work,
we establish two novel non-asymptotic bounds on the number of DPSS eigenvalues between $\epsilon$
and $1-\epsilon$. Furthermore, we obtain bounds detailing how close the first $\approx 2NW$ eigenvalues
are to $1$, how close the last $\approx N-2NW$ eigenvalues are to $0$, as well as how small certain
summations of these eigenvalues are. We also present simulations demonstrating the quality of
these non-asymptotic bounds on the number of DPSS eigenvalues between $\epsilon$ and $1-\epsilon$.
