Denote by ${\mathfrak s}({\mathbb F}_p^d)$ the minimal number $s$ such that among any $s$ (not necessarily
distinct) vectors in ${\mathbb F}_p^d$ one can find $p$ vectors whose sum is zero. Denote by ${\mathfrak
w}({\mathbb F}_p^d)$ the weak Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv constant, that is, the maximal number of
vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_s \in {\mathbb F}_p^d$ such that for any non-negative integers $\alpha_1,
\ldots, \alpha_s$ whose sum is $p$ we have $\alpha_1 v_1 + \ldots + \alpha_s v_s = 0$ if and only if $\alpha_i
= p$ for some $i$. We show that for any $p$ and $d$ we have an upper bound ${\mathfrak w}({\mathbb F}_p^d)
\le {2d-1 \choose d}+1$. The main result of this paper is that for any fixed $d$ and $p \rightarrow
\infty$ we have an asymptotic formula ${\mathfrak s}({\mathbb F}_p^d) \sim {\mathfrak w}({\mathbb
F}_p^d) p$. Together with the upper bound on ${\mathfrak w}({\mathbb F}_p^d)$ this result in particular
implies that ${\mathfrak s}({\mathbb F}_p^d) \le 4^d p$ for all sufficiently large $p$. In order
to prove the main result, we develop a framework of convex flags which generalize usual polytopes
in many ways. Many classical results of Convex Geometry translate naturally to this new setting.
In particular, we obtain analogues of Helly Theorem and of Central Point Theorem. Also we prove a
generalization of Integer Helly Theorem of Doignon. One of the main tools in our argument is the Flag
Decomposition Lemma which asserts that for any subset $X \subset {\mathbb F}_p^d$ one can find a
convex flag which approximates $X$ in a certain way. Then, Integer Central Point Theorem and other
tools allow us to solve the problem for this approximation. Finally, in order to lift the solution
back to the original set $X$ we apply the Set Expansion method of Alon-Dubiner.
