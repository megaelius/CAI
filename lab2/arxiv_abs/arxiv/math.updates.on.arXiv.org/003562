In this article we study the Quillen norm on the determinant line bundle associated with a family
of complex curves with cusps, which admit singular fibers. More precisely, we fix a family of complex
curves $\pi : X \to S$, which admit at most double-point singularities. Let $(\xi, h^{\xi})$ be a
holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle over $X$. Let $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_m : S \to X$ be disjoint
holomorphic sections. We denote the divisor $D_{X/S} := \rm{Im}(\sigma_1) + \cdots + \rm{Im}(\sigma_m)$,
and endow the relative canonical line bundle $\omega_{X/S}$ with a Hermitian norm such that its
restriction at each fiber of $\pi$ induces K\"ahler metric with hyperbolic cusps. This Hermitian
norm induces the Hermitian norm on the twisted relative canonical line bundle $\omega_{X/S}(D)
:= \omega_{X/S} \otimes \mathscr{O}_{X}(D_{X/S})$. For $n \leq 0$, we study the determinant line
bundle $\lambda(j^*(\xi \otimes \omega_{X/S}(D)^n))$. We endow it with the Quillen norm by using
the analytic torsion from the first paper of this series. Then we study the regularity of this Quillen
norm and its asymptotics near the locus of singular curves. The singular terms of the asymptotics
turn out to be reasonable enough, so that the curvature of $\lambda(j^*(\xi \otimes \omega_{X/S}(D)^n))$
is well-defined as a current over $S$. We derive the explicit formula for this current, which gives
a refinement of Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem at the level of currents. This generalizes
the curvature formulas of Takhtajan-Zograf and Bismut-Bost. As a consequence of our study, we also
get some regularity results on the Weil-Petersson form over the moduli space of pointed curves,
which are enough to conclude the well-known fact, originally due to Wolpert, that the Weil-Petersson
volume of the moduli space of pointed stable curves is a rational multiple of a power of $\pi$.
