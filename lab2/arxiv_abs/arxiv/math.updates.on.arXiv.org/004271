We study ergodic properties of Markovian multiclass many-server queues which are uniform over
scheduling policies, as well as the size n of the system. The system is heavily loaded in the Halfin-Whitt
regime, and the scheduling policies are work-conserving and preemptive. We provide a unified approach
via a Lyapunov function method that establishes Foster-Lyapunov equations for both the limiting
diffusion and the prelimit diffusion-scaled queueing processes simultaneously. We first study
the limiting controlled diffusion, and we show that if the spare capacity (safety staffing) parameter
is positive, then the diffusion is exponentially ergodic uniformly over all stationary Markov
controls, and the invariant probability measures have uniform exponential tails. This result
is sharp, since when there is no abandonment and the spare capacity parameter is negative, then the
controlled diffusion is transient under any Markov control. In addition, we show that if all the
abandonment rates are positive, the invariant probability measures have sub-Gaussian tails,
regardless whether the spare capacity parameter is positive or negative. Using the above results,
we proceed to establish the corresponding ergodic properties for the diffusion-scaled queueing
processes. In addition to providing a simpler proof of the results in Gamarnik and Stolyar [Queueing
Syst (2012) 71:25-51], we extend these results to the multiclass models with renewal arrival processes,
albeit under the assumption that the mean residual life functions are bounded. For the Markovian
model with Poisson arrivals, we obtain stronger results and show that the convergence to the stationary
distribution is at an exponential rate uniformly over all work-conserving stationary Markov scheduling
policies.
