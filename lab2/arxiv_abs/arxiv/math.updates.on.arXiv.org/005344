We study the long-term qualitative behavior of randomly perturbed dynamical systems. More specifically,
we look at limit cycles of stochastic differential equations (SDE) with Markovian switching, in
which the process switches at random times among different systems of SDEs, when the switching is
fast and the diffusion (white noise) term is small. The system is modeled by $$ dX^{\epsilon,\delta}(t)=f(X^{\epsilon,\delta}(t),
\alpha^\epsilon(t))dt+\sqrt{\delta}\sigma(X^{\epsilon,\delta}(t), \alpha^\epsilon(t))dW(t)
, \ X^\epsilon(0)=x, $$ where $\alpha^\epsilon(t)$ is a finite state space Markov chain with irreducible
generator $Q=(q_{ij})$. The relative changing rates of the switching and the diffusion are highlighted
by the two small parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. We associate to the system the averaged ODE
\[ d\bar X(t)=\bar f(\bar X(t))dt, \ X(0)=x, \] where $\bar f(\cdot)=\sum_{i=1}^{m_0}f(\cdot,
i)\nu_i$ and $(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_{m_0})$ is the unique invariant probability measure of the Markov
chain with generator $Q$. Suppose that for each pair $(\epsilon,\delta)$ of parameters, the process
has an invariant probability measure $\mu^{\epsilon,\delta}$, and that the averaged ODE has a
limit cycle in which there is an averaged occupation measure $\mu^0$ for the averaged equation.
We are able to prove that if $\bar f$ has finitely many unstable or hyperbolic fixed points, then $\mu^{\epsilon,\delta}$
converges weakly to $\mu^0$ as $\epsilon\to 0$ and $\delta \to 0$. Our results generalize to the
setting of state-dependent switching \[ \mathbb{P}\{\alpha^\epsilon(t+\Delta)=j~|~\alpha^\epsilon=i,
X^{\epsilon,\delta}(s),\alpha^\epsilon(s), s\leq t\}=q_{ij}(X^{\epsilon,\delta}(t))\Delta+o(\Delta),~~
i\neq j \] as long as the generator $Q(\cdot)=(q_{ij}(\cdot))$ is bounded, Lipschitz, and irreducible
for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We conclude our analysis by studying a predator-prey model.
