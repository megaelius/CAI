We consider the estimation of parameter-dependent statistics of functional outputs of elliptic
boundary value problems with parametrized random and deterministic inputs. For a given value of
the deterministic parameter, a stochastic Galerkin finite element (SGFE) method can estimate
the corresponding expectation and variance of a linear output at the cost of a single solution of
a large block-structured linear algebraic system of equations. We propose a stochastic Galerkin
reduced basis (SGRB) method as a means to lower the computational burden when statistical outputs
are required for a large number of deterministic parameter queries. To derive an SGRB model, we project
the spatial-stochastic weak solution of a parameter-dependent SGFE model onto a POD reduced basis
generated from snapshots of the SGFE solution at representative values of the parameter. We propose
residual-corrected estimates of the parameter-dependent expectation and variance of linear
functional outputs and provide respective computable error bounds. We test the SGRB method numerically
for a convection-diffusion-reaction problem, choosing the convective velocity as a deterministic
parameter and the parametrized reactivity field as a random input. Compared to a standard reduced
basis model embedded in a Monte Carlo sampling procedure, the SGRB model requires a similar number
of reduced basis functions to meet a given tolerance requirement. However, only a single run of the
SGRB model suffices to estimate a statistical output for a new deterministic parameter value, while
the standard reduced basis model must be solved for each Monte Carlo sample.
