We consider two manifestations of non-positive curvature: acylindrical actions (on hyperbolic
spaces) and quasigeodesic stability. We study these properties for the class of hierarchically
hyperbolic groups, which is a general framework for simultaneously studying many important families
of groups, including mapping class groups, right-angled Coxeter groups, most 3-manifold groups,
right-angled Artin groups, and many others. A group that admits an acylindrical action on a hyperbolic
space may admit many such actions on different hyperbolic spaces. It is natural to try to develop
an understanding of all such actions and to search for a "best" one. The set of all cobounded acylindrical
actions on hyperbolic spaces admits a natural poset structure, and in this paper we prove that all
hierarchically hyperbolic groups admit a unique action which is the largest in this poset. The action
we construct is also universal in the sense that every element which acts loxodromically in some
acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space does so in this one. Special cases of this result are themselves
new and interesting. For instance, this is the first proof that right-angled Coxeter groups admit
universal acylindrical actions. The notion of quasigeodesic stability of subgroups provides
a natural analogue of quasi-convexity which can be considered outside the context of hyperbolic
groups. In this paper, we provide a complete classification of stable subgroups of hierarchically
hyperbolic groups, generalizing and extending results that are known in the context of mapping
class groups and right-angled Artin groups. Along the way, we provide a characterization of contracting
quasigeodesics; interestingly, in this generality the proof is much simpler than in the special
cases where it was already known.
