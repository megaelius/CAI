We consider cache-aided wireless communication scenarios where each user requests both a file
from an a-priori generated cacheable library (referred to as 'content'), and an uncacheable 'non-content'
message generated at the start of the wireless transmission session. This scenario is easily found
in real-world wireless networks, where the two types of traffic coexist and share limited radio
resources. We focus on single-transmitter, single-antenna wireless networks with cache-aided
receivers, where the wireless channel is modelled by a degraded Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC).
For this setting, we study the delay-rate trade-off, which characterizes the content delivery
time and non-content communication rates that can be achieved simultaneously. We propose a scheme
based on the separation principle, which isolates the coded caching and multicasting problem from
the physical layer transmission problem. We show that this separation-based scheme is sufficient
for achieving an information-theoretically order optimal performance, up to a multiplicative
factor of 2.01 for the content delivery time, when working in the generalized degrees of freedom
(GDoF) limit. We further show that the achievable performance is near-optimal after relaxing the
GDoF limit, up to an additional additive factor of 2 bits per dimension for the non-content rates.
A key insight emerging from our scheme is that in some scenarios considerable amounts of non-content
traffic can be communicated while maintaining the minimum content delivery time, achieved in the
absence of non-content messages; compliments of 'topological holes' arising from asymmetries
in wireless channel gains.
