Let $Y$ be a derived geometric stack defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic
zero and satisfying three technical conditions: eventual coconnectivity, perfection and local
finite presentation. % For such $Y$, we consider the DG category $IndCoh(Y \times_{Y_{dR}} Y)$
of ind-coherent sheaves on the formal completion of the diagonal of $Y$, equipped with the convolution
monoidal structure. Within $IndCoh(Y \times_{Y_{dR}} Y)$, we single out a monoidal full subcategory
$\mathbb H(Y)$, defined as follows: an object of $IndCoh(Y \times_{Y_{dR}} Y)$ belongs to $\mathbb
H(Y)$ if its pullback along the diagonal $\Delta: Y \to Y \times_{Y_{dR}} Y$ is quasi-coherent.
Such DG category $\mathbb H(Y)$ will play an important role in several future applications. For
instance, let $G$ be a connected reductive group, with Langlands dual $\check{G}$, and ${LocSys}_{\check{G}}$
the stack of $\check{G}$-local systems on a smooth complete curve. Then $\mathbb H({LocSys}_{\check{G}})$
is expected to act on both sides of the geometric Langlands correspondence compatibly with the conjectural
equivalence $IndCoh_{N}(LocSys_{\check{G}}) \to D-mod(Bun_G)$. In this paper, we identify
the Drinfeld center of $\mathbb H(Y)$ with "$D-mod(LY)$", a certain version of the DG category of
left D-modules on the loop stack $LY := Y \times_{Y \times Y} Y$. Contrarily to ordinary (left) D-modules,
"$D-mod(LY)$" is sensitive to the derived structure of $LY$. By construction, "$D-mod(LY)$" is
the DG category of modules for a monad $U^Q(\mathbb T_{LY})$ acting on $QCoh(LY)$. In turn, the monad
$U^Q(\mathbb T_{LY})$ is obtained from the universal envelope of the Lie algebroid $\mathbb T_{LY}$
by a renormalization procedure that uses the PBW filtration.
