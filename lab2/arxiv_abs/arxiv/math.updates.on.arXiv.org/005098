Background: Genotype-phenotype maps provide a meaningful filtration of sequence space and RNA
secondary structures are particular such phenotypes. Compatible sequences i.e.~sequences that
satisfy the base pairing constraints of a given RNA structure play an important role in the context
of neutral networks and inverse folding. Sequences satisfying the constraints of two structures
simultaneously are called bicompatible and phenotypic change, induced by erroneously replicating
populations of RNA sequences, is closely connected to bicompatibility. Furthermore, bicompatible
sequences are relevant for riboswitch sequences, beacons of evolution, realizing two distinct
phenotypes. Results: We present a full loop energy model Boltzmann sampler of bicompatible sequences
for pairs of structures. The novel dynamic programming algorithm is based on a topological framework
encapsulating the relations between loops. We utilize our sequence sampler to study the energy
spectra and density of bicompatible sequences, the rankings of the structures and key properties
for evolutionary transitions. Conclusion: Our analysis of riboswitch sequences shows that key
properties of bicompatible sequences depend on the particular pair of structures. While there
always exist bicompatible sequences for random structure pairs, they are less suited to facilitate
transitions. We show that native riboswitch sequences exhibit a distinct signature with regards
to the ranking of their two phenotypes relative to the minimum free energy, suggesting a new criterion
for identifying native sequences and sequences subjected to evolutionary pressure.
