360$^o$ video is an essential component of VR/AR/MR systems that provides immersive experience
to the users. However, 360$^o$ video is associated with high bandwidth requirements. The required
bandwidth can be reduced by exploiting the fact that users are interested in viewing only a part of
the video scene and that users request viewports that overlap with each other. Motivated by the findings
of recent works where the benefits of caching video tiles at edge servers instead of caching entire
360$^o$ videos were shown, in this paper, we introduce the concept of virtual viewports that have
the same number of tiles with the original viewports. The tiles forming these viewports are the most
popular ones for each video and are determined by the users' requests. Then, we propose a proactive
caching scheme that assumes unknown videos' and viewports' popularity. Our scheme determines
which videos to cache as well as which is the optimal virtual viewport per video. Virtual viewports
permit to lower the dimensionality of the cache optimization problem. To solve the problem, we first
formulate the content placement of 360$^o$ videos in edge cache networks as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP), and then we determine the optimal caching placement using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm.
The proposed solution aims at maximizing the overall quality of the 360$^o$ videos delivered to
the end-users by caching the most popular 360$^o$ videos at base quality along with a virtual viewport
in high quality. We extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed system and compare it with
that of known systems such as LFU, LRU, FIFO, over both synthetic and real 360$^o$ video traces. The
results reveal the large benefits coming from proactive caching of virtual viewports instead of
the original ones in terms of the overall quality of the rendered viewports, the cache hit ratio,
and the servicing cost.
