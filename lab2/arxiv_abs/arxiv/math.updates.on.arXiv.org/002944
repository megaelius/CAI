The absolute upper bound on the number of equiangular lines that can be found in ${\mathbf{R}}^d$
is $d(d+1)/2$. Examples of sets of lines that saturate this bound are only known to exist in dimensions
$d=2,3,7$ or $23$, but until now, no classification of any family of lines that saturate this bound
has existed. By considering the additional property of incoherence, we prove that there exists
a set of equiangular lines that saturates the absolute bound and the incoherence bound if and only
if $d=2,3,7$ or $23$. This allows us classify all tight spherical $5$-designs $X$ in ${\mathbf{S}}^{d-1}$,
the unit sphere, with the property that there exists a set of $d$ points in $X$ whose pairwise inner
products are positive. For a given angle $\kappa$, there exists a relative upper bound on the number
of equiangular lines in ${\mathbf{R}}^d$ with common angle $\kappa$. We prove that classifying
sets of lines that saturate this bound along with the incoherence bound is equivalent to classifying
certain quasi-symmetric designs, which are combinatorial designs with two block intersection
numbers. Given some further natural assumptions, we classify the known sets of lines that saturate
these two bounds. This family comprises of the lines mentioned above and the maximal set of $16$ equiangular
lines found in ${\mathbf{R}}^6$. There are infinitely many known sets of lines that saturate the
relative bound, so this result is surprising. To shed some light on this, we construct the roots of
the $E_8$ lattice from the 276 equiangular lines in ${\mathbf{R}}^{23}$ and observe a correspondence
between sets of equiangular lines in small dimensions and the exceptional curves of del Pezzo surfaces.
