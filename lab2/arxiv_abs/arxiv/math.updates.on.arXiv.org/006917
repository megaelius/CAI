Genetic sequencing has become an increasingly affordable and accessible source of genomic data
in computational biology. This data is often represented as $k$-mers, i.e., strings of some fixed
length $k$ with symbols chosen from a reference alphabet. In contrast, some of the most effective
and well-studied machine learning algorithms require numerical representations of the data.
The concept of metric dimension of the so-called Hamming graphs presents a promising way to address
this issue. A subset of vertices in a graph is said to be resolving when the distances to those vertices
uniquely characterize every vertex in the graph. The metric dimension of a graph is the size of a smallest
resolving subset of vertices. Finding the metric dimension of a general graph is a challenging problem,
NP-complete in fact. Recently, an efficient algorithm for finding resolving sets in Hamming graphs
has been proposed, which suffices to uniquely embed $k$-mers into a real vector space. Since the
dimension of the embedding is the cardinality of the associated resolving set, determining whether
or not a node can be removed from a resolving set while keeping it resolving is of great interest. This
can be quite challenging for large graphs since only a brute-force approach is known for checking
whether a set is a resolving set or not. In this thesis, we characterize resolvability of Hamming
graphs in terms of a linear system over a finite domain: a set of nodes is resolving if and only if the
linear system has only a trivial solution over said domain. We can represent the domain as the roots
of a polynomial system so the apparatus of Gr\"obner bases comes in handy to determine, whether or
not a set of nodes is resolving. As proof of concept, we study the resolvability of Hamming graphs
associated with octapeptides i.e. proteins sequences of length eight.
