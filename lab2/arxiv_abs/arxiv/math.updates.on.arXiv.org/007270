Computing spectral properties of operators has many applications throughout the sciences and
is arguably one of the most investigated areas of computational mathematics. However, the problem
of computing spectra of general operators has only recently been solved, giving rise to the Solvability
Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, a classification tool determining the boundaries of what computers
can achieve, which is very much related to Smale's comprehensive program on the foundations of computational
mathematics initiated in the 1980s. These results reveal that infinite-dimensional spectral
problems yield a highly intricate infinite classification theory determining which spectral
problems can be solved and with which type of algorithm. As well as computing spectra, in many applications
it is vital to determine spectral features such as Lebesgue measure, capacity or fractal dimensions,
different types of spectral radii and numerical ranges, or to detect essential spectral gaps and
the failure of finite section methods. Despite substantial interest in such problems, questions
on the existence of algorithms remain unanswered. This paper, the second of a two-part series establishing
the foundations of computational spectral theory via the SCI hierarchy, has four main purposes.
First, we establish answers to many of these longstanding spectral problems and provide the first
algorithms for their computation. Second, these classifications determine which types of problems
can be used in computer-assisted proofs and we provide some of the first results in this infinite
classification theory. Third, the proofs are constructive and, as demonstrated with computational
examples, the new algorithms yield a library of methods. Finally, we provide a new universal mechanism
for establishing lower bounds in the SCI hierarchy, which both greatly simplifies previous analysis
and allows new classifications.
