An ordered graph is a graph equipped with a linear ordering of its vertex set. A pair of ordered graphs
is Ramsey finite if it has only finitely many minimal ordered Ramsey graphs and Ramsey infinite otherwise.
Here an ordered graph F is an ordered Ramsey graph of a pair (H,H') of ordered graphs if for any coloring
of the edges of F in colors red and blue there is either a copy of H with all edges colored red or a copy
of H' with all edges colored blue. Such an ordered Ramsey graph is minimal if neither of its proper
subgraphs is an ordered Ramsey graph of (H,H'). If H=H' then H itself is called Ramsey finite. We show
that a connected ordered graph is Ramsey finite if and only if it is a star with center being the first
or the last vertex in the linear order. In general we prove that each Ramsey finite (not necessarily
connected) ordered graph H has a pseudoforest as a Ramsey graph and therefore is a star forest with
strong restrictions on the positions of the centers of the stars. In the asymmetric case we show that
(H,H') is Ramsey finite whenever H is a so-called monotone matching. Among several further results
we show that there are Ramsey finite pairs of ordered stars and ordered caterpillars of arbitrary
size and diameter. This is in contrast to the unordered setting where for any Ramsey finite pair (H,H')
of forests either one of H or H' is a matching or both are star forests (with additional constraints).
Several of our results give a relation between Ramsey finiteness and the existence of sparse ordered
Ramsey graphs. Motivated by these relations we characterize all pairs of ordered graphs that have
a forest as an ordered Ramsey graph and all pairs of connected ordered graphs that have a pseudoforest
as a Ramsey graph.
