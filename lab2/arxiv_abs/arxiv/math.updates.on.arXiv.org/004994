We study a five-compartment mathematical model originally proposed by Kuznetsov et al. (1994)
to investigate the effect of nonlinear interactions between tumour and immune cells in the tumour
microenvironment, whereby immune cells may induce tumour cell death, and tumour cells may inactivate
immune cells. Exploiting a separation of timescales in the model, we use the method of matched asymptotics
to derive a new two-dimensional, long-timescale, approximation of the full model, which differs
from the quasi-steady-state approximation introduced by Kuznetsov et al. (1994), but is validated
against numerical solutions of the full model. Through a phase-plane analysis, we show that our
reduced model is excitable, a feature not traditionally associated with tumour-immune dynamics.
Through a systematic parameter sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that excitability generates
complex bifurcating dynamics in the model. These are consistent with a variety of clinically observed
phenomena, and suggest that excitability may underpin tumour-immune interactions. The model
exhibits the three stages of immunoediting - elimination, equilibrium, and escape, via stable
steady states with different tumour cell concentrations. Such heterogeneity in tumour cell numbers
can stem from variability in initial conditions and/or model parameters that control the properties
of the immune system and its response to the tumour. We identify different biophysical parameter
targets that could be manipulated with immunotherapy in order to control tumour size, and we find
that preferred strategies may differ between patients depending on the strength of their immune
systems, as determined by patient-specific values of associated model parameters.
