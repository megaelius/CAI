This paper develops output feedback boundary control to mitigate traffic congestion of a unidirectional
two-lane freeway segment. The macroscopic traffic dynamics are described by the Aw-Rascle-Zhang
(ARZ) model respectively for both the fast and slow lanes. The traffic density and velocity of each
of the two lanes are governed by coupled $2 \times 2$ nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential
equations (PDEs). Lane-changing interactions between the two lanes lead to exchanging source
terms between the two pairs second-order PDEs. Therefore, we are dealing with $4 \times 4$ nonlinear
coupled hyperbolic PDEs. Based on driver's preference for the slow and fast lanes, a reference system
of lane-specific uniform steady states in congested traffic is chosen. To stabilize traffic densities
and velocities of both lanes to the steady states, two distinct variable speed limits (VSL) are applied
at outlet boundary, controlling the traffic velocity of each lane. Using backstepping transformation,
we map the coupled heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE system into a cascade target system, in which
traffic oscillations are damped out through actuation of the velocities at the downstream boundary.
Two full-state feedback boundary control laws are developed. We also design a collocated boundary
observer for state estimation with sensing of densities at the outlet. Output feedback boundary
controllers are obtained by combining the collocated observer and full-state feedback controllers.
The finite time convergence to equilibrium is achieved for both the controllers and observer designs.
Numerical simulations validate our design in two different traffic scenarios.
