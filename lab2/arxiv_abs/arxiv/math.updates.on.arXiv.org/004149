Simulation of multiphase poromechanics involves solving a multi-physics problem in which multiphase
flow and transport are tightly coupled with the porous medium deformation. To capture this dynamic
interplay, fully implicit methods, also known as monolithic approaches, are usually preferred.
The main bottleneck of a monolithic approach is that it requires solution of large linear systems
that result from the discretization and linearization of the governing balance equations. Because
such systems are non-symmetric, indefinite, and highly ill-conditioned, preconditioning is
critical for fast convergence. Recently, most efforts in designing efficient preconditioners
for multiphase poromechanics have been dominated by physics-based strategies. Current state-of-the-art
"black-box" solvers such as algebraic multigrid (AMG) are ineffective because they cannot effectively
capture the strong coupling between the mechanics and the flow sub-problems, as well as the coupling
inherent in the multiphase flow and transport process. In this work, we develop an algebraic framework
based on multigrid reduction (MGR) that is suited for tightly coupled systems of PDEs. Using this
framework, the decoupling between the equations is done algebraically through defining appropriate
interpolation and restriction operators. One can then employ existing solvers for each of the decoupled
blocks or design a new solver based on knowledge of the physics. We demonstrate the applicability
of our framework when used as a "black-box" solver for multiphase poromechanics. We show that the
framework is flexible to accommodate a wide range of scenarios, as well as efficient and scalable
for large problems.
