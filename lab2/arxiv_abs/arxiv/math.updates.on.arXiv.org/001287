We use strong complementarity to introduce dynamics and symmetries within the framework of CQM,
which we also extend to infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces: these were long-missing
features, which open the way to a wealth of new applications. The coherent treatment presented in
this work also provides a variety of novel insights into the dynamics and symmetries of quantum systems:
examples include the extremely simple characterisation of symmetry-observable duality, the
connection of strong complementarity with the Weyl Canonical Commutation Relations, the generalisations
of Feynman's clock construction, the existence of time observables and the emergence of quantum
clocks. Furthermore, we show that strong complementarity is a key resource for quantum algorithms
and protocols. We provide the first fully diagrammatic, theory-independent proof of correctness
for the quantum algorithm solving the Hidden Subgroup Problem, and show that strong complementarity
is the feature providing the quantum advantage. In quantum foundations, we use strong complementarity
to derive the exact conditions relating non-locality to the structure of phase groups, within the
context of Mermin-type non-locality arguments. Our non-locality results find further application
to quantum cryptography, where we use them to define a quantum-classical secret sharing scheme
with provable device-independent security guarantees. All in all, we argue that strong complementarity
is a truly powerful and versatile building block for quantum theory and its applications, and one
that should draw a lot more attention in the future.
