In this paper we study the numerical instabilities of the NLS Akhmediev breather, the simplest space
periodic, one-mode perturbation of the unstable background, limiting our considerations to the
simplest case of one unstable mode. In agreement with recent theoretical findings of the authors,
in the situation in which the round-off errors are negligible with respect to the perturbations
due to the discrete scheme used in the numerical experiments, the split-step Fourier method (SSFM),
the numerical output is well-described by a suitable genus 2 finite-gap solution of NLS. This solution
can be written in terms of different elementary functions in different time regions and, ultimately,
it shows an exact recurrence of rogue waves described, at each appearance, by the Akhmediev breather.
We discover a remarkable empirical formula connecting the recurrence time with the number of time
steps used in the SSFM and, via our recent theoretical findings, we establish that the SSFM opens
up a vertical unstable gap whose length can be computed with high accuracy, and is proportional to
the inverse of the square of the number of time steps used in the SSFM. This neat picture essentially
changes when the round-off error is sufficiently large. Indeed experiments in standard double
precision show serious instabilities in both the periods and phases of the recurrence. In contrast
with it, as predicted by the theory, replacing the exact Akhmediev Cauchy datum by its first harmonic
approximation, we only slightly modify the numerical output. Let us also remark, that the first
rogue wave appearance is completely stable in all experiments and is in perfect agreement with the
Akhmediev formula and with the theoretical prediction in terms of the Cauchy data.
