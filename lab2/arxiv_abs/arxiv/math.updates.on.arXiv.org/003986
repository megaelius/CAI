We call a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ nowhere constant if it is not constant on any non-empty open subset
of its domain $X$. Clearly, this is equivalent with the assumption that every fiber $f^{-1}(y)$
of $f$ is nowhere dense in $X$. We call the continuous map $f : X \to Y$ pseudo-open if for each nowhere
dense $Z \subset Y$ its inverse image $f^{-1}(Z)$ is nowhere dense in $X$. Clearly, if $Y$ is crowded,
i.e. has no isolated points, then $f$ is nowhere constant. The aim of this paper is to study the following,
admittedly imprecise, question: How "small" nowhere constant, resp. pseudo-open continuous
images can "large" spaces have? Our main results yield the following two precise answers to this
question, explaining also our title. Both of them involve the cardinal function $\widehat{c}(X)$,
the "hat version" of cellularity, which is defined as the smallest cardinal $\kappa$ such that there
is no $\kappa$-sized disjoint family of open sets in $X$. Thus, for instance, $\widehat{c}(X) =
\omega_1$ means that $X$ is CCC. THEOREM A. Any crowded Tychonov space $X$ has a crowded Tychonov
nowhere constant continuous image $Y$ of weight $w(Y) \le \widehat{c}(X)$. Moreover, in this statement
$\le$ may be replaced with $<$ iff there are no $\widehat{c}(X)$-Suslin lines (or trees). THEOREM
B. Any crowded Tychonov space $X$ has a crowded Tychonov pseudo-open continuous image $Y$ of weight
$w(Y) \le 2^{<\widehat{c}(X)}$. If Martin's axiom holds then there is a CCC crowded Tychonov space
$X$ such that for any crowded Hausdorff pseudo-open continuous image $Y$ of $X$ we have $w(Y) \ge
\mathfrak{c}\,( = 2^{< \omega_1})$.
