In this work, we present an abstract error analysis framework for the approximation of linear partial
differential equation (PDE) problems in weak formulation. We consider approximation methods
in fully discrete formulation, where the discrete and continuous spaces are possibly not embedded
in a common space. A proper notion of consistency is designed, and, under a classical inf-sup condition,
it is shown to bound the approximation error. This error estimate result is in the spirit of Strang's
first and second lemmas, but applicable in situations not covered by these lemmas (because of a fully
discrete approximation space). An improved estimate is also established in a weaker norm, using
the Aubin--Nitsche trick. We then apply these abstract estimates to an anisotropic heterogeneous
diffusion model and two classical families of schemes for this model: Virtual Element and Finite
Volume methods. For each of these methods, we show that the abstract results yield new error estimates
with a precise and mild dependency on the local anisotropy ratio. A key intermediate step to derive
such estimates for Virtual Element Methods is proving optimal approximation properties of the
oblique elliptic projector in weighted Sobolev seminorms. This is a result whose interest goes
beyond the specific model and methods considered here. We also obtain, to our knowledge, the first
clear notion of consistency for Finite Volume methods, which leads to a generic error estimate involving
the fluxes and valid for a wide range of Finite Volume schemes. An important application is the first
error estimate for Multi-Point Flux Approximation L and G methods. In the appendix, not included
in the published version of this work, we show that classical estimates for discontinuous Galerkin
methods can be obtained with simplified arguments using the abstract framework.
