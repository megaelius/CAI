This paper proposes and analyzes arbitrarily high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite
volume methods which provably preserve the positivity of density and pressure for the ideal MHD
on general meshes. Unified auxiliary theories are built for rigorously analyzing the positivity-preserving
(PP) property of MHD schemes with a HLL type flux on polytopal meshes in any space dimension. The main
challenges overcome here include establishing relation between the PP property and discrete divergence
of magnetic field on general meshes, and estimating proper wave speeds in the HLL flux to ensure the
PP property. In 1D case, we prove that the standard DG and finite volume methods with the proposed
HLL flux are PP, under condition accessible by a PP limiter. For multidimensional conservative
MHD system, standard DG methods with a PP limiter are not PP in general, due to the effect of unavoidable
divergence-error. We construct provably PP high-order DG and finite volume schemes by proper discretization
of symmetrizable MHD system, with two divergence-controlling techniques: locally divergence-free
elements and a penalty term. The former leads to zero divergence within each cell, while the latter
controls the divergence error across cell interfaces. Our analysis reveals that a coupling of them
is important for positivity preservation, as they exactly contribute the discrete divergence-terms
absent in standard DG schemes but crucial for ensuring the PP property. Numerical tests confirm
the PP property and the effectiveness of proposed PP schemes. Unlike conservative MHD system, the
exact smooth solutions of symmetrizable MHD system are proved to retain the positivity even if the
divergence-free condition is not satisfied. Our analysis and findings further the understanding,
at both discrete and continuous levels, of the relation between the PP property and the divergence-free
constraint.
