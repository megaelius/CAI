A conceptually clean renormalization scheme, dispensing altogether with series expansions,
is introduced for quantum and statistical fields in the Euclidean setting. Space-time is represented
by a projective system of coarse regions, implementing varying energy scales, and fields are constructed
as cylinder probability densities (martingales) with respect to a L\'evy white noise. Instead
of points, fields are evaluated on ultrafilters of the coarse region lattice, encompassing all
scales in one stroke. Euclidean invariance is given from the start. A second ingredient is our Wick
product of field evaluations which, together with the S-transform, allows to define a rich observable
algebra containing the Gibbs factors one would usually like to deal with. A last essential ingredient
is Hypothesis R of subsection 1.5, closing section 1 and completing our renormalization scheme
by providing a tool to explicitly calculate (conditional) expectations. Theorem 34 shows how the
reconstruction of a field theory in Lorentzian signature works in our setup. In section 2 we work
out in detail expressions of Wick products for the cases of Gauss, Poisson and Gamma fields. The proofs
given there unveil the regularization effect of Wick products through concrete formulas. Thereby
we shall encounter pretty familiar polynomials, like falling factorials and Hermite polynomials.
Finally we explore in section 3 several applications of our approach. For instance, a quantum field
theory with $\phi^4$ interaction can be formulated painlessly in our setting for any dimension,
with the non-existence theorem bypassed because the corresponding Euclidean measure is reflection
positive but not stochastically positive.
