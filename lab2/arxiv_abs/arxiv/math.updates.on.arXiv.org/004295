We study oligopolistic competition in service markets where firms offer a service to customers.
The service quality of a firm (from a customer's perspective) depends on the level of congestion
and the charged price. A firm can set a price for the service offered and additionally decides on the
service capacity to mitigate congestion. The total profit of a firm is derived from the gained revenue
minus the capacity investment cost. Firms simultaneously set capacities and prices to maximize
their profit and customers subsequently choose the services with lowest combined cost (congestion
and price). For this model, Johari, Weintraub and Van Roy derived the first existence and uniqueness
results of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) assuming mild conditions on congestion functions. Their
existence proof relies on Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and a key assumption for the theorem to
work is that demand for service is elastic, i.e., there is a smooth inverse demand function determining
the volume of customers given the effective customers' costs. In this paper, we consider the case
of inelastic demand. This scenario applies to realistic cases where customers are not willing to
drop out of the market, e.g., if prices are regulated by reasonable price caps. We investigate existence,
uniqueness and quality of PNE for models with inelastic demand and price caps. We show that for linear
congestion cost functions, there exists a PNE. This result requires a completely new proof approach
compared to previous approaches, since best responses may not exist and thus standard fixed-point
arguments are not directly applicable. We show that the game is C-secure (see Reny, and McLennan,
Monteiro and Tourky), which leads to the existence of PNE. We furthermore show that the PNE is unique
and that the efficiency compared to a social optimum is unbounded in general.
