We study representations of MV-algebras -- equivalently, unital lattice-ordered abelian groups
-- through the lens of Stone-Priestley duality, using canonical extensions as an essential tool.
Specifically, the theory of canonical extensions implies that the (Stone-Priestley) dual spaces
of MV-algebras carry the structure of topological partial commutative ordered semigroups. We
use this structure to obtain two different decompositions of such spaces, one indexed over the prime
MV-spectrum, the other over the maximal MV-spectrum. These decompositions yield sheaf representations
of MV-algebras, using a new and purely duality-theoretic result that relates certain sheaf representations
of distributive lattices to decompositions of their dual spaces. Importantly, the proofs of the
MV-algebraic representation theorems that we obtain in this way are distinguished from the existing
work on this topic by the following features: (1) we use only basic algebraic facts about MV-algebras;
(2) we show that the two aforementioned sheaf representations are special cases of a common result,
with potential for generalizations; and (3) we show that these results are strongly related to the
structure of the Stone-Priestley duals of MV-algebras. In addition, using our analysis of these
decompositions, we prove that MV-algebras with isomorphic underlying lattices have homeomorphic
maximal MV-spectra. This result is an MV-algebraic generalization of a classical theorem by Kaplansky
stating that two compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic if, and only if, the lattices of continuous
[0, 1]-valued functions on the spaces are isomorphic.
