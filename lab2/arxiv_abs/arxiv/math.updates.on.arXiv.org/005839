We present here a multilayer model for shallow grain-fluid mixtures with dilatancy effects. It
can be seen as a generalization of the depth-averaged model presented in Bouchut et al. (2016), that
includes dilatancy effects by considering a two-layer model, a mixture grain-fluid layer and an
upper fluid layer, to allow the exchange of fluid between them. In the present work the approximation
of the mixture layer is improved including normal variations of the velocities and concentrations
of the two phases thanks to the multilayer approach. In the model presented here dilatancy effects
induce in particular a non-hydrostatic pressure for both phases related to the excess pore fluid
pressure. We identified here one of the main numerical difficulty of solving two-phase shallow
debris flows models: the strongly non-linear behaviour and abrupt changes of the excess pore fluid
pressure when starting from non-equilibrium conditions. We propose a simplified approach to approximate
the excess pore fluid pressure in the simple case of uniform flows. Our method makes it possible to
introduce two or three layers in the normal directions with a reasonable approximation. Analytical
solutions for uniform grain-fluid flows over inclined planes, with and without side wall friction,
are calculated and compared to the proposed model. In the numerical results, we observe that the
proposed model with a two layer description of the mixture accurately represents the velocity measured
at the surface of the mixture in the laboratory experiments. This is obviously poorly represented
by the depth-averaged velocity in single-layer models. Our numerical results show a significant
impact of the parameters involved in dilatancy law, in particular on the calculation of the time
evolution of the excess pore fluid pressure.
