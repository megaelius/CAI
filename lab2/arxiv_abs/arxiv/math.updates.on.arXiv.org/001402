Recently subclasses of polynomial ensembles for additive and multiplicative matrix convolutions
were identified which were called P\'olya ensembles (or polynomial ensembles of derivative type).
Those ensembles are closed under the respective convolutions and, thus, build a semi-group when
adding by hand a unit element. They even have a semi-group action on the polynomial ensembles. Moreover
in several works transformations of the bi-orthogonal functions and kernels of a given polynomial
ensemble were derived when performing an additive or multiplicative matrix convolution with particular
P\'olya ensembles. For the multiplicative matrix convolution on the complex square matrices the
transformations were even done for general P\'olya ensembles. In the present work we generalize
these results to the additive convolution on Hermitian matrices, on Hermitian anti-symmetric
matrices, on Hermitian anti-self-dual matrices and on rectangular complex matrices. For this
purpose we derive the bi-orthogonal functions and the corresponding kernel for a general P\'olya
ensemble which was not done before. With the help of these results we find transformation formulas
for the convolution with a fixed matrix or a random matrix drawn from a general polynomial ensemble.
As an example we consider P\'olya ensembles with an associated weight which is a P\'olya frequency
function of infinite order. But we also explicitly evaluate the Gaussian unitary ensemble as well
as the complex Laguerre (aka Wishart, Ginibre or chiral Gaussian unitary) ensemble. All results
hold for finite matrix dimension. Furthermore we derive a recursive relation between Toeplitz
determinants which appears as a by-product of our results.
