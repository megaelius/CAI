In this paper we construct (nonhomogeneous) quantum Markov chains associated with open quantum
random walks. We then discuss the reducibility and irreducibility of open quantum random walks
via the corresponding quantum Markov chains. The quantum Markov chain was introduced by Accardi
by using transition expectation, and the construction of the quantum Markov chain associated with
the open quantum random walk was introduced by Dhahri and Mukhamedov. A remarkable point in this
paper is that we have relaxed the Markovian property to sub-Markovian property for the transition
expectations. The Markovian property is requested only when we talk together with the initial states
and the transition expectations, i.e., in the level of quantum Markov chains. When we apply the theory
of quantum Markov chains to certain models, e.g., the open quantum random walks discussed in this
paper, it seems that this new approach is necessary in order to properly recover the original dynamics.
Here, using the above mentioned method, we construct the nonhomogeneous quantum Markov chains
for the open quantum random walks. Such a quantum Markov chain is natural in the sense that the evolution
of the open quantum random walk can be recovered by the corresponding quantum Markov chain. We provide
with some examples. In particular, we show that the classical Markov chains are reconstructed as
quantum Markov chains. After constructing the quantum Markov chains associated with open quantum
random walks, we investigate the reducibility and irreducibility of open quantum random walks
in the language of quantum Markov chains. It is particularly interesting to notice that the concept
of (ir)reducibility of open quantum random walks in this approach is equivalent to the one previously
done by Carbone and Pautrat.
