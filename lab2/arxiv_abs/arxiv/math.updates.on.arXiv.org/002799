We present a variation of the method of regularized Stokeslet (MRS) specialized for the case of forces
and torques distributed over filaments in three dimensions. The new formulation is based on the
exact solution of Stokes equation generated by a linear continuous distribution of regularized
forces along a line segment. Therefore, a straight filament with linearly varying forces does not
require discretization. A general filament is approximated by a piecewise linear curve in three
dimensions where the length of each line segment is chosen only based on the variation of the force
field and the desired accuracy of its piecewise linear approximation. The most significant advantage
of this formulation is that the values of the regularization parameter $\epsilon$ and the length
of the segments $h$ are decoupled as long as $\epsilon<h$ so that $\epsilon$ can be selected as a proxy
for the radius of the filament and $h$ is chosen to discretize the forces and torques. We analyze the
performance on test problems and present biological applications of sperm motility based on existing
models of swimming flagella in open space and near a plane wall. The results show, for example, that
because the forces along the flagellum vary mildly, a flagellum can be approximated with as few as
11 segments of length $h$ while fixing the regularization parameter to $\epsilon=h/30$, overcoming
the need for hundreds of discretization nodes required by the MRS when $\epsilon$ is small. The filament
behaves like a slender cylindrical tube of radius $\approx 0.97\epsilon$ so that the value of $\epsilon$
influences the flagellum's swimming speed. For fixed regularization, doubling the number of line
segments does not affect the results significantly as long as the force field is resolved. Examples
that require rotlets and potential dipoles along the filament are also presented.
