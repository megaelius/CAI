We develop a combined field formulation for the fluid structure (FS) interaction problem. The unknowns
are (u;p;v), being the fluid velocity, fluid pressure and solid velocity. This combined field formulation
uses Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) description for the fluid and Lagrangian description
for the solid. It automatically enforces the simultaneous continuities of both velocity and traction
along the FS interface. We present a first order in time fully discrete scheme when the flow is incompressible
Navier-Stokes and when the solid is elastic. The interface position is determined by first order
extrapolation so that the generation of the fluid mesh and the computation of (u;p;v) are decoupled.
This explicit interface advancing enables us to save half of the unknowns comparing with traditional
monolithic schemes. When the solid has convex strain energy (e.g. linear elastic), we prove that
the total energy of the fluid and the solid at time t^{n} is bounded by the total energy at time t^{n-1}.
Like in the continuous case, the fluid mesh velocity which is used in ALE description does not enter
into the stability bound. Surprisingly, the nonlinear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations
plays a crucial role to stabilize the scheme and the stability result does not apply to Stokes flow.
As the nonlinear convection term is treated semi-implicitly, in each time step, we only need to solve
a linear system (and only once) which involves merely (u;p;v) if the solid is linear elastic. Two
numerical tests including the benchmark test of Navier-Stokes flow past a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff
elastic bar are performed. In addition to the stability, we also confirm the first order temporal
accuracy of our explicit interface advancing scheme.
