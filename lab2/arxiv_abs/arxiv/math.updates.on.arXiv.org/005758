This paper studies a secrecy unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with coordinated
multi-point (CoMP) reception, in which one UAV sends confidential messages to a set of cooperative
ground receivers (GRs), in the presence of several suspicious eavesdroppers. In particular, we
consider two types of eavesdroppers that are non-colluding and colluding, respectively. Under
this setup, we exploit the UAV's maneuver in three dimensional (3D) space together with transmit
power adaptation for optimizing the secrecy communication performance. First, we consider the
quasi-stationary UAV scenario, where we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D placement and transmit power
control to maximize the secrecy rate. Under both non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers, we
obtain the optimal solutions to the joint 3D placement and transmit power control problems in well
structures. Next, we consider the mobile UAV scenario, where we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D trajectory
and transmit power allocation to maximize the average secrecy rate during the whole communication
period. To deal with the difficult joint 3D trajectory and transmit power allocation problems,
we present alternating-optimization-based approaches to obtain high-quality solutions. Finally,
we provide numerical results to validate the performance of our proposed designs. It is shown that
due to the consideration of CoMP reception, our proposed design with 3D maneuver significantly
outperforms the conventional design with two dimensional (2D) (horizontal) maneuver only, by
exploiting the additional degrees of freedom in altitudes. It is also shown that the non-colluding
and colluding eavesdroppers lead to distinct 3D UAV maneuver behaviors.
