The growth of e-commerce has created increasing complexity in logistics service. To remain competitive
in the market, logistics and e-commerce companies are exploring new modes as supplements to traditional
home delivery, one of which is the self-service parcel locker. This paper studies the use of parcel
lockers as an innovative solution to the last-mile delivery problem. We consider a logistics company
that plans to introduce the locker service by locating a fixed number of lockers in the network. The
objective is to attract as many customers to use the locker service as possible, namely, the captured
demand rate. Customers' choices on whether to use the locker service or which locker to select are
predicted by a discrete choice model. In the literature, a popular approach is to use the multinomial
logit model. However, such a model cannot explain zero-probability choices that appear in practice
and tends to overestimate the captured demand rate. To overcome the issue, the threshold luce model
is applied instead. In its definition, when locker x has a significantly lower attractiveness compared
to locker y, locker x considers being dominated by locker y. The probability of selecting x will be
zero in the presence of y. We then propose two equivalent formulations for the locker location problem
under threshold luce model and derive a valid inequality based on directed acyclic graph theory
to improve the formulation. Two solution approaches, i.e., outer approximation and mixed-integer
conic quadratic programming approach (MICQP), are developed. Extensive numerical studies reveal
that the MICQP approach with improved inequalities outperforms the others. Finally, we conduct
a case study and draw managerial implications.
