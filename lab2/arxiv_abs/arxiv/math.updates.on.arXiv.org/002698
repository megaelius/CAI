We develop an in-depth analysis of the $SO(4)$ Landau models on $S^3$ in the $SU(2)$ monopole background
and their associated matrix geometry. The Schwinger and Dirac gauges for the $SU(2)$ monopole are
introduced to provide a concrete coordinate representation of $SO(4)$ operators and wavefunctions.
The gauge fixing enables us to demonstrate algebraic relations of the operators and the $SO(4)$
covariance of the eigenfunctions. With the spin connection of $S^3$, we construct a $SO(4)$ invariant
Weyl-Landau operator and analyze its eigenvalue problem with explicit form of the eigenstates.
The obtained results include the known formulae of the free Weyl operator eigenstates in the free
field limit. %A synthetic connection of spin and gauge connections plays a crucial role in solving
the eigenvalue problem of the relativistic Landau models. Other eigenvalue problems of variant
relativistic Landau models, such as massive Dirac-Landau and supersymmetric Landau models, are
investigated too. %The $SO(4)$ Landau model on $S^3$ is a typical model that realizes the quantum
Nambu geometry of fuzzy three-sphere. With the developed $SO(4)$ technologies, we derive the three-dimensional
matrix geometry in the Landau models. By applying the level projection method to the Landau models,
we identify the matrix elements of the $S^3$ coordinates as the fuzzy three-sphere. For the non-relativistic
model, it is shown that the fuzzy three-sphere geometry emerges in each of the Landau levels and only
in the lowest degenerate sub-bands. We also point out that Dirac-Landau operator accommodates
two fuzzy three-spheres in each Landau level and the mass term induces interaction between them.
