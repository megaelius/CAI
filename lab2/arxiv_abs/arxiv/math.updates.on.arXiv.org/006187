In this study, we consider the physical layer security in the downlink of a Massive MIMO system employing
one-bit quantization at the base station (BS). We assume an active eavesdropper that attempts to
spoiling the channel estimation acquisition at the BS for a legitimate user, whereas overhearing
on downlink transmission. We consider the two most widespread methods for degrading the eavesdropper's
channel, the nullspace artificial noise (NS-AN) and random artificial noise (R-AN). Then, we present
a lower bound on the secrecy rate and asymptotic performance, considering zero-forcing beamforming
(ZF-BF) and maximum-ratio transmission beamforming (MRT-BF). Our results reveal that even when
the eavesdropper is close enough to the intercepted user, a positive secrecy rate --which tends
to saturation with increasing the number of BS antennas $N$---is possible, as long as the transmit
power of eavesdropper is less than that of the legitimate user during channel training. We show that
ZF-BF with NS-AN provides the best performance. It is found that MRT-BF and ZF-BF are equivalent
in the asymptotic limit of $N$ and hence the artificial noise technique is the performance indicator.
Moreover, we study the impact of \emph{power-scaling law} on the secrecy rate. When the transmit
power of BS is reduced proportional to $1/N$, the performance is independent of artificial noise
asymptotically and hence the beamforming technique is the performance indicator. In addition,
when the BS's power is reduced proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$, all combinations of beamforming and
artificial noise schemes are equally likely asymptotically, independent of quantization noise.
We present various numerical results to corroborate our analysis.
