For $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, $m\geq 1$ and a given function $f : \mathbb{R}^m\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$,
the \emph{polynomial interpolation problem} (PIP) is to determine a \emph{unisolvent node set}
$P_{m,n} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ of $N(m,n):=|P_{m,n}|=\binom{m+n}{n}$ points and the uniquely
defined polynomial $Q_{m,n,f}\in \Pi_{m,n}$ in $m$ variables of degree $\mathrm{deg}(Q_{m,n,f})\leq
n \in \mathbb{N}$ that fits $f$ on $P_{m,n}$, i.e., $Q_{m,n,f}(p) = f(p)$, $\forall\, p \in P_{m,n}$.
For $m=1$ the solution to the PIP is well known. In higher dimensions, however, no closed framework
was available. We here present a generalization of the classic Newton interpolation from one-dimensional
to arbitrary-dimensional spaces. Further we formulate an algorithm, termed PIP-SOLVER, based
on a \emph{multivariate divided difference scheme} that computes the solution $Q_{m,n,f}$ in
$\mathcal{O}\big(N(m,n)^2\big)$ time using $\mathcal{O}\big(mN(m,n)\big)$ memory. %For
arbitrary $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, $m \geq 1$, we here further develop our characterization of unisolvent
node sets and the corresponding (weak) PIP-SOLVER presented in \cite{PIP1}. Further, we introduce
unisolvent \emph{Newton-Chebyshev nodes} and show that these nodes avoid \emph{Runge's phenomenon}
in the sense that arbitrary periodic \emph{Sobolev functions} $f \in H^k(\Omega,\mathbb{R})
\subsetneq C^0(\Omega,\mathbb{R})$, $\Omega =[-1,1]^m$ of regularity $k >m/2$ can be uniformly
approximated, i.e., $ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}||\,f -Q_{m,n,f} \,||_{C^0(\Omega)}= 0$.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the computational performance and approximation accuracy
of the PIP-SOLVER in practice. We expect the presented results to be relevant for many applications,
including numerical solvers, quadrature, non-linear optimization, polynomial regression,
adaptive sampling, Bayesian inference, and spectral analysis.
