Energy harvesting (EH) from ambient radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves is an efficient
solution for fully autonomous and sustainable communication networks. Most of the related works
presented in the literature are based on specific (and small-scale) network structures, which
although give useful insights on the potential benefits of the RF-EH technology, cannot characterize
the performance of general networks. In this paper, we adopt a large-scale approach of the RF-EH
technology and we characterize the performance of a network with random number of transmitter-receiver
pairs by using stochastic-geometry tools. Specifically, we analyze the outage probability performance
and the average harvested energy, when receivers employ power splitting (PS) technique for "simultaneous"
information and energy transfer. A non-cooperative scheme, where information/energy are conveyed
only via direct links, is firstly considered and the outage performance of the system as well as the
average harvested energy are derived in closed form in function of the power splitting. For this
protocol, an interesting optimization problem which minimizes the transmitted power under outage
probability and harvesting constraints, is formulated and solved in closed form. In addition,
we study a cooperative protocol where sources' transmissions are supported by a random number of
potential relays that are randomly distributed into the network. In this case, information/energy
can be received at each destination via two independent and orthogonal paths (in case of relaying).
We characterize both performance metrics, when a selection combining scheme is applied at the receivers
and a single relay is randomly selected for cooperative diversity.
