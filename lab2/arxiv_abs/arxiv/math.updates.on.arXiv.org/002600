Given a finite collection of pairwise distinct infinite binary words, there is a minimal length
finite prefix for each word such that the resulting collection of finite prefixes is also pairwise
distinct. The set of initial segments of these finite prefixes may be identified with the leaves
of a tree. A depth first search of this radix sort tree produces an ordering of the leaves that agrees
with the lexicographic ordering of the corresponding infinite binary words. The radix sort tree
stores information that is redundant for the purpose of sorting the input infinite binary words
into lexicographic order. Indeed, if one deletes the out-degree $1$ vertices in the radix sort tree
and "closes up the gaps", then the resulting PATRICIA tree maintains all the information that is
necessary for sorting. We investigate the PATRICIA chains -- the tree-valued Markov chains that
arise when successively building the PATRICIA trees for the collection of infinite binary words
$Z_1,\ldots, Z_n$, $n=1,2,\ldots$, where the source words $Z_1, Z_2,\ldots$ are independent
and have a common diffuse distribution on $\{0,1\}^\infty$. It turns out that the PATRICIA chains
share a common collection of backward transition probabilities and that these are the same as those
of a chain introduced by R\'emy for successively generating uniform random binary trees with larger
and larger numbers of leaves. This means that the infinite bridges of any PATRICIA chain coincide
with the infinite bridges of the R\'emy chain. The infinite bridges of the R\'emy chain are characterized
concretely in Evans, Gr\"ubel, and Wakolbinger 2017 and we recall that characterization here while
adding some details and clarifications.
