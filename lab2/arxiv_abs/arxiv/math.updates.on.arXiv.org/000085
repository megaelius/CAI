Here are described the axiumbilic points that appear in generic one parameter families of surfaces
immersed in R4. At these points the ellipse of curvature of the immersion, Little, Garcia - Sotomayor
has equal axes. A review is made on the basic preliminaries on axial curvature lines and the associated
axiumbilic points which are the singularities of the fields of principal, mean axial lines}, axial
crossings and the quartic differential equation defining them. The Lie-Cartan vector field suspension
of the quartic differential equation, giving a line field tangent to the Lie-Cartan surface (in
the projective bundle of the source immersed surface which quadruply covers a punctured neighborhood
of the axiumbilic point) whose integral curves project regularly on the lines of axial curvature.
In an appropriate Monge chart the configurations of the generic axiumbilic points, denoted by E3,
E4 and E5, are obtained by studying the integral curves of the Lie-Cartan vector field. Elementary
bifurcation theory is applied to the study of the transition and elimination between the axiumbilic
generic points. The two generic patterns E^1_{34} and E^1_{45} are analysed and their axial configurations
are explained in terms of their qualitative changes (bifurcations) with one parameter in the space
of immersions, focusing on their close analogy with the saddle-node bifurcation for vector fields
in the plane . This work can be regarded as a partial extension to R4 of the umbilic bifurcations in
Garcia - Gutierrez - Sotomayor for surfaces in R3. With less restrictive differentiability hypotheses
and distinct methodology it has points of contact with the results of Gutierrez - Guinez - Castaneda.
