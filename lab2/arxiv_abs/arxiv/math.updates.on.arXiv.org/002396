In this paper, we consider the $n$-dimensional ($n=2,3$) Camassa-Holm equations with fractional
Laplacian viscosity in the whole space. In stark contrast to the Camassa-Holm equations without
any nonlocal effect, to our best knowledge, little has been known on the large time behavior and convergence
for the nonlocal equations under study. We first study the large time behavior of solutions. We then
discuss the relation between the equations under consideration and the imcompressible Navier-Stokes
equations with fractional Laplacian viscosity (INSF). The main difficulty to achieve them lies
in the fractional Laplacian viscosity. Fortunately, by employing some properties of fractional
Laplacian, in particular, the fractional Leibniz chain rule and the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev
type estimates, the high and low frequency splitting method and the Fourier splitting method, we
first establish the large time behavior concerning non-uniform decay and algebraic decay of solutions
to the nonlocal equations under study. In particular, under the critical case $s=\dfrac{n}{4}$,
the nonlocal version of Ladyzhenskaya's inequality is skillfully used, and the smallness of initial
data in several Sobolev spaces is required to gain the non-uniform decay and algebraic decay. On
the other hand, by means of the fractional heat kernel estimates, we figure out the relation between
the nonlocal equations under consideration and the equations (INSF). Specifically, we prove that
the solution to the Camassa-Holm equations with nonlocal viscosity converges strongly as the filter
parameter $\alpha\rightarrow~0$ to a solution of the equations (INSF).
