In quantum many-body systems with local interactions, quantum information and entanglement cannot
spread outside of a "linear light cone," which expands at an emergent velocity analogous to the speed
of light. Yet most non-relativistic physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions:
two degrees of freedom separated by a distance $r$ interact with potential energy $V(r) \propto
1/r^{\alpha}$. In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously establish a hierarchy
of linear light cones: at the same $\alpha$, some quantum information processing tasks are constrained
by a linear light cone while others are not. In one spatial dimension, commutators of local operators
$\langle \psi| [\mathcal{O}_x(t),\mathcal{O}_y] |\psi\rangle$ are negligible in every state
$|\psi\rangle$ when $|x-y|\gtrsim vt$, where $v$ is finite when $\alpha>3$ (Lieb-Robinson light
cone); in a typical state $|\psi\rangle$ drawn from the infinite temperature ensemble, $v$ is finite
when $\alpha>\frac{5}{2}$ (Frobenius light cone); in non-interacting systems, $v$ is finite
in every state when $\alpha>2$ (free light cone). These bounds apply to time-dependent systems
and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our theorems regarding the Lieb-Robinson and
free light cones, and their tightness, also generalize to arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the
implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of topological order, the
clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the digital simulation of systems with long-range
interactions. In addition, we show that quantum state transfer and many-body quantum chaos are
bounded by the Frobenius light cone, and therefore are poorly constrained by all Lieb-Robinson
bounds.
