It is well known that every stable matching instance $I$ has a \emph{rotation poset} $R(I)$ that
can be computed efficiently and the downsets of $R(I)$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the
stable matchings of $I$. Furthermore, for every poset $P$, an instance $I(P)$ can be constructed
efficiently so that the rotation poset of $I(P)$ is isomorphic to $P$. In this case, we say that $I(P)$
\emph{realizes} $P$. Many researchers exploit the rotation poset of an instance to develop fast
algorithms or to establish the hardness of stable matching problems. To make the problem of sampling
stable matchings more tractable, Bhatnagar et al. [SODA 2008] introduced stable matching instances
whose preference lists are restricted but nevertheless model situations that arise in practice.
In this paper, we study four such parameterized restrictions; our goal is to characterize the rotation
posets that arise from these models: $k$-bounded, $k$-attribute, $(k_1, k_2)$-list, $k$-range.
We prove that there is a constant $k$ so that \emph{every} rotation poset is realized by some instance
in the first three models for some fixed constant $k$. We describe efficient algorithms for constructing
such instances given the Hasse diagram of a poset. As a consequence, the fundamental problem of counting
stable matchings remains $\#$BIS-complete even for these restricted instances. For $k$-range
preferences, we show that a poset $P$ is realizable if and only if the Hasse diagram of $P$ has pathwidth
bounded by functions of $k$. Using this characterization, we show that the following problems are
fixed parameter tractable when parametrized by the range of the instance: exactly counting and
uniformly sampling stable matchings, finding median, sex-equal, and balanced stable matchings.
