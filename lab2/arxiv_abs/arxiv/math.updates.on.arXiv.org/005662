We present a formal model of human decision-making in explore-exploit tasks using the context of
multi-armed bandit problems, where the decision-maker must choose among multiple options with
uncertain rewards. We address the standard multi-armed bandit problem, the multi-armed bandit
problem with transition costs, and the multi-armed bandit problem on graphs. We focus on the case
of Gaussian rewards in a setting where the decision-maker uses Bayesian inference to estimate the
reward values. We model the decision-maker's prior knowledge with the Bayesian prior on the mean
reward. We develop the upper credible limit (UCL) algorithm for the standard multi-armed bandit
problem and show that this deterministic algorithm achieves logarithmic cumulative expected
regret, which is optimal performance for uninformative priors. We show how good priors and good
assumptions on the correlation structure among arms can greatly enhance decision-making performance,
even over short time horizons. We extend to the stochastic UCL algorithm and draw several connections
to human decision-making behavior. We present empirical data from human experiments and show that
human performance is efficiently captured by the stochastic UCL algorithm with appropriate parameters.
For the multi-armed bandit problem with transition costs and the multi-armed bandit problem on
graphs, we generalize the UCL algorithm to the block UCL algorithm and the graphical block UCL algorithm,
respectively. We show that these algorithms also achieve logarithmic cumulative expected regret
and require a sub-logarithmic expected number of transitions among arms. We further illustrate
the performance of these algorithms with numerical examples. NB: Appendix G included in this version
details minor modifications that correct for an oversight in the previously-published proofs.
