We deal with the problem of asymptotic distribution of first return times to shrinking balls under
iteration generated by a large general class of dynamical systems called weakly Markov. Our ultimate
main result is that these distributions converge to the exponential law when the balls shrink to
points. We apply this result to many classes of smooth dynamical systems that include conformal
iterated function systems, rational functions on the Riemann sphere $\widehat{\mathbb C}$, and
transcendental meromorphic functions on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. We also apply them to
expanding repellers and holomorphic endomorphisms of complex projective spaces. One of the key
ingredients in our approach is to solve the well known, in this field of mathematics, problem of appropriately
estimating the measures of, suitably defined, large class of geometric annuli. We successfully
do it. This problem is, in the existing literature, differently referred to by different authors;
we call it the Thick Thin Annuli Property. Having this property established, we prove that for non--conformal
systems the aforementioned distributions converge to the exponential one along sets of radii whose
relative Lebesgue measure converges fast to one. But this is not all. In the context of conformal
iterated function systems, we establish the Full Thin Annuli Property, which gives the same estimates
for all radii. ln this way, we solve a long standing problem. As a result, we prove that the convergence
to the exponential law holds along all radii for essentially all conformal iterated function systems
and, with the help of the techniques of first return maps, for all aforementioned conformal dynamical
systems.
