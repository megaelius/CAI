The log Euclidean polyrigid registration framework provides a way to smoothly estimate and interpolate
poly-rigid/affine transformations for which the invertibility is guaranteed. This powerful
and flexible mathematical framework is currently being used to track the human joint dynamics by
first imposing bone rigidity constraints in order to synthetize the spatio-temporal joint deformations
later. However, since no closed-form exists, then a computationally expensive integration of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is required to perform image registration using this framework.
To tackle this problem, the exponential map for solving these ODEs is computed using the scaling
and squaring method in the literature. In this paper, we propose an algorithm using a matrix diagonalization
based method for smooth interpolation of homogeneous polyrigid transformations of human joints
during motion. The use of this alternative computational approach to integrate ODEs is well motivated
by the fact that bone rigid transformations satisfy the mechanical constraints of human joint motion,
which provide conditions that guarantee the diagonalizability of local bone transformations
and consequently of the resulting joint transformations. In a comparison with the scaling and squaring
method, we discuss the usefulness of the matrix eigendecomposition technique which reduces significantly
the computational burden associated with the computation of matrix exponential over a dense regular
grid. Finally, we have applied the method to enhance the temporal resolution of dynamic MRI sequences
of the ankle joint. To conclude, numerical experiments show that the eigendecomposition method
is more capable of balancing the trade-off between accuracy, computation time, and memory requirements.
