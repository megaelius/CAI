The distribution of random parameters in, and the input signal to, a distributed parameter model
with unbounded input and output operators for the transdermal transport of ethanol are estimated.
The model takes the form of a diffusion equation with the input, which is on the boundary of the domain,
being the blood or breath alcohol concentration (BAC/BrAC), and the output, also on the boundary,
being the transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC). Our approach is based on the reformulation
of the underlying dynamical system in such a way that the random parameters are treated as additional
spatial variables. When the distribution to be estimated is assumed to be defined in terms of a joint
density, estimating the distribution is equivalent to estimating a functional diffusivity in
a multi-dimensional diffusion equation. The resulting system is referred to as a population model,
and well-established finite dimensional approximation schemes, functional analytic based convergence
arguments, optimization techniques, and computational methods can be used to fit it to population
data and to analyze the resulting fit. Once the forward population model has been identified or trained
based on a sample from the population, the resulting distribution can then be used to deconvolve
the BAC/BrAC input signal from the biosensor observed TAC output signal formulated as either a quadratic
programming or linear quadratic tracking problem. In addition, our approach allows for the direct
computation of corresponding credible bands without simulation. We use our technique to estimate
bivariate normal distributions and deconvolve BAC/BrAC from TAC based on data from a population
that consists of multiple drinking episodes from a single subject and a population consisting of
single drinking episodes from multiple subjects.
