We deal with zero-delay source coding of a vector-valued Gauss-Markov source subject to a mean-squared
error (MSE) fidelity criterion characterized by the operational zero-delay vector-valued Gaussian
rate distortion function (RDF). We address this problem by considering the nonanticipative RDF
(NRDF) which is a lower bound to the causal optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA)
function and operational zero-delay RDF. We recall the realization that corresponds to the optimal
"test-channel" of the Gaussian NRDF, when considering a vector Gauss-Markov source subject to
a MSE distortion in the finite time horizon. Then, we introduce sufficient conditions to show existence
of solution for this problem in the infinite time horizon. For the asymptotic regime, we use the asymptotic
characterization of the Gaussian NRDF to provide a new equivalent realization scheme with feedback
which is characterized by a resource allocation (reverse-waterfilling) problem across the dimension
of the vector source. We leverage the new realization to derive a predictive coding scheme via lattice
quantization with subtractive dither and joint memoryless entropy coding. This coding scheme
offers an upper bound to the operational zero-delay vector-valued Gaussian RDF. When we use scalar
quantization, then for "r" active dimensions of the vector Gauss-Markov source the gap between
the obtained lower and theoretical upper bounds is less than or equal to 0.254r + 1 bits/vector. We
further show that it is possible when we use vector quantization, and assume infinite dimensional
Gauss-Markov sources to make the previous gap to be negligible, i.e., Gaussian NRDF approximates
the operational zero-delay Gaussian RDF. We also extend our results to vector-valued Gaussian
sources of any finite memory under mild conditions. Our theoretical framework is demonstrated
with illustrative numerical experiments.
