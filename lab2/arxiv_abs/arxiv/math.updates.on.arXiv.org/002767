The active bijection for oriented matroids (and real hyperplane arrangements, and graphs, as particular
cases) is introduced and investigated by the authors in a series of papers. Given any oriented matroid
defined on a linearly ordered ground set, we exhibit one particularit\'e of its bases, which we call
its active basis, with remarkable properties. It preserves activities (for oriented matroids
in the sense of Las Vergnas, for matroid bases in the sense of Tutte), as well as some active partitions
of the ground set associated with oriented matroids and matroid bases. It yields a canonical bijection
between classes of reorientations and bases [...]. It also yields a refined bijection between all
reorientations and subsets of the ground set. Those bijections are related to various Tutte polynomial
expressions [...]. They contain various noticeable bijections involving orientations/signatures/reorientations
and spanning trees/simplices/bases of a graph/real hyperplane arrangement/oriented matroid.
[...] In previous papers of this series, we defined the active bijection between bounded regions
and uniactive internal bases by means of fully optimal bases (No. 1), and we defined a decomposition
of activities for matroid bases by means of [...] particular sequences of minors (companion paper,
No. 2.a). The present paper is central in the series. First, we define a decomposition of activities
for oriented matroids, using the same sequences of minors, yielding a decomposition of an oriented
matroid into bounded regions of minors. Second, we use the previous results together to provide
the canonical and refined active bijections alluded to above. We also give an overview and examples
of the various results of independent interest involved in the construction. They arise as soon
as the ground set of an oriented matroid is linearly ordered.
