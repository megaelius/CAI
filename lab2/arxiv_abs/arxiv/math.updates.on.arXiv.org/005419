First passage problems for spectrally negative L\'evy processes with possible absorbtion or/and
reflection at boundaries have been widely applied in mathematical finance, risk, queueing, and
inventory/storage theory. Historically, such problems were tackled by taking Laplace transform
of the associated Kolmogorov integro-differential equations involving the generator operator.
In the last years there appeared an alternative approach based on the solution of two fundamental
"two-sided exit" problems from an interval (TSE). A spectrally one-sided process will exit smoothly
on one side on an interval, and the solution is simply expressed in terms of a "scale function" $W$
(Bertoin 1997). The non-smooth two-sided exit (or ruin) problem suggests introducing a second
scale function $Z$ (Avram, Kyprianou and Pistorius 2004). Since many other problems can be reduced
to TSE, researchers produced in the last years a kit of formulas expressed in terms of the "$W,Z$ alphabet"
for a great variety of first passage problems. We collect here our favorite recipes from this kit,
including a recent one (94) which generalizes the classic De Finetti dividend problem. One interesting
use of the kit is for recognizing relationships between apparently unrelated problems -- see Lemma
3. Last but not least, it turned out recently that once the classic $W,Z$ are replaced with appropriate
generalizations, the classic formulas for (absorbed/ reflected) L\'evy processes continue to
hold for: a) spectrally negative Markov additive processes (Ivanovs and Palmowski 2012), b) spectrally
negative L\'evy processes with Poissonian Parisian absorbtion or/and reflection (Avram, Perez
and Yamazaki 2017, Avram Zhou 2017), or with Omega killing (Li and Palmowski 2017).
