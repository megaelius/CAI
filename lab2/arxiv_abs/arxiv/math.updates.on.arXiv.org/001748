In this paper, we study the problem of multi-band (frequency-variant) covariance interpolation
with a particular emphasis towards massive MIMO applications. In a massive MIMO system, the communication
between each BS with $M \gg 1$ antennas and each single-antenna user occurs through a collection
of scatterers in the environment, where the channel vector of each user at BS antennas consists in
a weighted linear combination of the array responses of the scatterers, where each scatterer has
its own angle of arrival (AoA) and complex channel gain. The array response at a given AoA depends
on the wavelength of the incoming planar wave and is naturally frequency dependent. This results
in a frequency-dependent distortion where the second order statistics, i.e., the covariance matrix,
of the channel vectors varies with frequency. In this paper, we show that although this effect is
generally negligible for a small number of antennas $M$, it results in a considerable distortion
of the covariance matrix and especially its dominant signal subspace in the massive MIMO regime
where $M \to \infty$, and can generally incur a serious degradation of the performance especially
in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems where the uplink (UL) and the downlink
(DL) communication occur over different frequency bands. We propose a novel UL-DL covariance interpolation
technique that is able to recover the covariance matrix in the DL from an estimate of the covariance
matrix in the UL under a mild reciprocity condition on the angular power spread function (PSF) of
the users. We analyze the performance of our proposed scheme mathematically and prove its robustness
under a sufficiently large spatial oversampling of the array. We also propose several simple off-the-shelf
algorithms for UL-DL covariance interpolation and evaluate their performance via numerical simulations.
