This paper has a two-fold purpose: 1) to clarify the difference between contact and weak-contact
interactions (called point interactions in [A] in the case $N=2$) in three dimensions and their
role in providing spectral properties and boundary conditions. 2) to analyze the same problem in
two dimensions. Both contact and weak-contact are "zero range interactions" or equivalently self-adjoint
extension of the symmetric operator $\hat H_0$, the free hamiltonian for a system of $N$ particles,
restricted to functions that vanish in some neighborhood of the \emph{contact manyfold} $ \Gamma
= \cup_{i,j} \{ x_i - x_j = 0\} \;\; i \not= j =1 \ldots N $. The \emph{hamiltonian formulation} of a
weak-contact interaction requires the presence of a zero energy resonance. Both can be obtained,
for $N \geq 3$, as scaling limit, in the strong resolvent sense, of hamiltonians with two-body central
potentials of very short range; the scaling is different in the two cases. The contact "potential"
is a distribution on the "contact manyfold"; the laplacian is now two dimensional and the scaling
properties under dilation of the laplacian are now the same as those of the contact interaction.
This makes a major difference in the spectral properties. Contact interaction defines now a hamiltonian
system. In two dimensions one can consider a hamiltonian system of three particle of mass $m$ having
as potential a contact potential and \emph{the product of two weak-contact potentials}. In the
limit $ m \to \infty$ their wave functions have vanishingly small support and the system may be regarded
as a \emph{point with internal structure}; the spectrum has an essential singularity at the bottom
of the continuous part. The Wave Operator for the interaction with a fourth particle extends to a
bounded map on $L ^p $ for all $ 1 < p < \infty $ [E,G,G]
