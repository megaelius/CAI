A version of the Bondal-Orlov conjecture, proved by Bridgeland, states that if $X$ and $Y$ are smooth
complex projective threefolds linked by a flop, then they are derived equivalent. Van den Bergh
gave a new proof of Bridgeland's theorem using the notion of a NCCR, which is in particular a ring $A$
together with a derived equivalence between $X$ and $A$. This ring $A$ is constructed as an endomorphism
ring of a decomposable module, and hence admits an idempotent $e$. Donovan and Wemyss define the
contraction algebra $A_\mathrm{con}$ to be the quotient of $A$ by $e$; it is a finite-dimensional
noncommutative algebra that is conjectured to completely recover the geometry of the base of the
flop. They show that $A_\mathrm{con}$ represents the noncommutative deformation theory of the
flopping curves, and also controls the Bridgeland-Chen flop-flop autoequivalence of the derived
category of $X$. In this thesis, I construct and prove properties of a new invariant, the derived
contraction algebra $A^\mathrm{der}_\mathrm{con}$, which I define to be Braun-Chuang-Lazarev's
derived quotient of $A$ by $e$. A priori, $A^\mathrm{der}_\mathrm{con}$ - which is a dga, rather
than just an algebra - is a finer invariant than the classical contraction algebra. I prove (using
recent results of Hua and Keller) a derived version of the Donovan-Wemyss conjecture, a suitable
phrasing of which is true in all dimensions. I prove that the derived quotient admits an interpretation
in terms of derived deformation theory. I prove that $A^\mathrm{der}_\mathrm{con}$ controls
a generalised flop-flop autoequivalence. These results both recover and extend Donovan-Wemyss's.
I give concrete applications and computations in the case of partial resolutions of Kleinian singularities,
where the classical contraction algebra becomes inadequate.
