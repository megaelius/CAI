This is the second in a series of articles devoted to showing that a typical covering map of large degree
to a fixed, regular graph has its new adjacency eigenvalues within the bound conjectured by Alon
for random regular graphs. The first main result in this article concerns the function $f(k,n)$
defined as the number of SNBC (strictly non-backtracking closed) walks of length $k$ of a given homotopy
type in a random covering graph of degree $n$ of a fixed graph. We prove the existence of asymptotic
expansions in powers of $1/n$ for $f(k,n)$, where the coefficients---functions of $k$---are proven
to have some desirable properties; namely, these coefficients are approximately a sum of polynomials
times exponential functions. The second main result is a generalization of the first, where the
number of SNBC walks of length $k$ is multiplied by an indicator function that the covering graph
contains a certain type of {\em tangle}; the second result requires more terminology, although
its proof uses the same basic tools used to prove the first result. % The motivation for the second
main result will be clear in % the third article in this series of articles. The results in this article
are mostly straightforward generalizations of methods used in previous works. However, this article
(1) "factors" these methods into a number of short, conceptually simple, and independent parts,
(2) writes each independent part in more general terms, and (3) significantly simplifies of one
of the previous computations. As such we expect that this article will make it easier to apply trace
methods to related models of random graphs.
