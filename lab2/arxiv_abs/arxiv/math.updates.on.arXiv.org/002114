The motion of a rolling ball actuated by internal point masses that move inside the ball's frame of
reference is considered. The equations of motion are derived by applying Euler-Poincar\'e's symmetry
reduction method in concert with Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle, which accounts for the presence
of the nonholonomic rolling constraint. As a particular example, we consider the case when the masses
move along internal rails, or trajectories, of arbitrary shape and fixed within the ball's frame
of reference. Our system of equations can treat most possible methods of actuating the rolling ball
with internal moving masses encountered in the literature, such as circular motion of the masses
mimicking swinging pendula or straight line motion of the masses mimicking magnets sliding inside
linear tubes embedded within a solenoid. Moreover, our method can model arbitrary rail shapes and
an arbitrary number of rails such as several ellipses and/or figure eights, which may be important
for future designs of rolling ball robots. For further analytical study, we also reduce the system
to a single differential equation when the motion is planar, that is, considering the motion of the
rolling disk actuated by internal point masses, in which case we show that the results obtained from
the variational derivation coincide with those obtained from Newton's second law. Finally, the
equations of motion are solved numerically, illustrating a wealth of complex behaviors exhibited
by the system's dynamics. Our results are relevant to the dynamics of nonholonomic systems containing
internal degrees of freedom and to further studies of control of such systems actuated by internal
masses.
