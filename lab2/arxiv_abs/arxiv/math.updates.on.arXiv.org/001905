We use operator algebras and operator theory to obtain new result concerning Berezin quantization
of compact K\"ahler manifolds. Our main tool is the notion of subproduct systems of finite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, which enables all involved objects, such as the Toeplitz operators, to be very conveniently
expressed in terms of shift operators compressed to a subspace of full Fock space. This subspace
is not required to be contained in the symmetric Fock space, so from finite-dimensional matrix algebras
we can construct noncommutative manifolds with extra structure generalizing that of a projective
variety endowed with a positive Hermitian line bundle and a canonical K\"ahler metric in the class
of the line bundle. Even in the commutative setting these constructions are very fruitful. Firstly,
we show that the algebra of smooth functions on any smooth projective variety can be quantized in
a strong sense of inductive limits, as was previously only accomplished for homogeneous manifolds.
In this way the K\"ahler manifold is recovered exactly from quantization and not just approximately.
Secondly, we obtain a strict quantization also for singular varieties. Thirdly, we show that the
Arveson conjecture is true in full generality for shift operators compressed to the subspace of
symmetric Fock space associated with any homogeneous ideal. For noncommutative examples we consider
homogeneous spaces for compact matrix quantum groups which generalize $q$-deformed projective
spaces, and we show that these can be obtained as the cores of Cuntz--Pimsner algebras constructed
solely from the representation theory of the quantum group. We also discuss interesting connections
with noncommutative random walks.
