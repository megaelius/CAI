In this paper, the problem of self-organizing, correlation-aware clustering is studied for a dense
network of machine-type devices (MTDs) deployed over a cellular network. In dense machine-to-machine
networks, MTDs are typically located within close proximity and will gather correlated data, and,
thus, clustering MTDs based on data correlation will lead to a decrease in the number of redundant
bits transmitted to the base station. To analyze this clustering problem, a novel utility function
that captures the average MTD transmission power per cluster is derived, as a function of the MTD
location, cluster size, and inter-cluster interference. Then, the clustering problem is formulated
as an evolutionary game, which models the interactions among the massive number of MTDs, in order
to decrease MTD transmission power. To solve this game, a distributed algorithm is proposed to allow
the infinite number of MTDs to autonomously form clusters. It is shown that the proposed distributed
algorithm converges to an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), that is robust to a small portion
of MTDs deviating from the stable cluster formation at convergence. The maximum fraction of MTDs
that can deviate from the ESS, while still maintaining a stable cluster formation is derived. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach can effectively cluster MTDs with highly correlated data,
which, in turn, enables those MTDs to eliminate a large number of redundant bits. The results show
that, on average, using the proposed approach yields reductions of up to 23.4% and 9.6% in terms of
the transmit power per cluster, compared to forming clusters with the maximum possible size and
uniformly selecting a cluster size, respectively.
