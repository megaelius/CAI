We investigate different numerical techniques for evolving moist atmospheric flows within a fully
compressible framework. In the standard numerical approach, the choice of variables is motivated
by those that remain invariant in dry adiabatic flow, phase transitions are treated as an external
energy source, and the physically-irrelevant fast acoustic modes are decoupled during the numerical
integration. For the purposes of this study, we consider the compressible Euler equations in terms
of the primitive thermodynamic variables, namely density, momentum, and total energy of moist
air, without any special numerical treatment of the fast acoustic dynamics. This allows us to incorporate
consistent moist thermodynamic properties throughout the numerical solution, and to thoroughly
investigate both the standard two-step splitting approach for moist atmospheric flows as well
as a fully coupled technique based on the use of variables that are conserved in moist flows, i.e.
total energy of moist air and total water content. Cloudy air is described as a two-phase fluid in
which water vapor and liquid are in thermodynamic equilibrium. The numerical techniques with the
adopted formulation we describe are validated by comparing to a well-established benchmark problem.
Particular attention is then paid to the impact of advancing moist microphysics at a slower pace,
as is often the case when acoustic modes are separately integrated in time, neglecting phase change
related phenomena, or more naturally when considering sound-proof equations. It is shown that
advancing moist microphysics on a slower time-scale than the fluid dynamics is permitted as long
as the moist thermodynamic properties are consistently updated and included while advancing the
dynamics.
