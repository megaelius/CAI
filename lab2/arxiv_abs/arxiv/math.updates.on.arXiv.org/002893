In a recent paper, Buckmaster & Vicol (arXiv:1709.10033) used the method of convex integration
to construct weak solutions $u$ to the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations such that $\|
u(t) \|_{L^2} =e(t)$ for a given non-negative and smooth energy profile $e: [0,T]\to \mathbb{R}$.
However, it is not known whether it is possible to extend this method to construct nonunique solutions
suitable weak solutions (that is weak solutions satisfying the strong energy inequality (SEI)
and the local energy inequality (LEI), Leray-Hopf weak solutions (that is weak solutions satisfying
the SEI), or at least to exclude energy profiles that are not nonincreasing. In this paper we are concerned
with weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality on $\mathbb{R}^3$, that is vector fields that
satisfy both the SEI and the LEI (but not necessarily solve the Navier--Stokes equations). Given
$T>0$ and a nonincreasing energy profile $e\colon [0,T] \to [0,\infty )$ we construct weak solution
to the Navier-Stokes inequality that are localised in space and whose energy profile $\| u(t)\|_{L^2
(\mathbb{R}^3 )}$ stays arbitrarily close to $e(t)$ for all $t\in [0,T]$. The relevance of such
solutions is that, despite not satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations, they satisfy the partial
regularity theory of Caffarelli, Kohn & Nirenberg (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 1982)). In fact, Scheffer's
constructions of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality with blow-ups (Comm. Math. Phys.,
1985 & 1987) show that the Caffarelli, Kohn & Nirenberg's theory is sharp for such solutions. Our
approach gives an indication of a number of ideas used by Scheffer. Moreover, it can be used to obtain
a stronger result than Scheffer's. Namely, we obtain weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality
with both a prescribed energy profile and blow-ups.
