We linearize the Einstein-scalar field equations, expressed relative to constant mean curvature
(CMC)-transported spatial coordinates gauge, around members of the well-known family of Kasner
solutions on $(0,\infty) \times \mathbb{T}^3$. The Kasner solutions model a spatially uniform
scalar field evolving in a (typically) spatially anisotropic spacetime that expands towards the
future and that has a "Big Bang" singularity at $\lbrace t = 0 \rbrace$. We place initial data for the
linearized system along $\lbrace t = 1 \rbrace \simeq \mathbb{T}^3$ and study the linear solution's
behavior in the collapsing direction $t \downarrow 0$. Our first main result is the proof of an approximate
$L^2$ monotonicity identity for the linear solutions. Using it, we prove a linear stability result
that holds when the background Kasner solution is sufficiently close to the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) solution. In particular, we show that as $t \downarrow 0$, various time-rescaled components
of the linear solution converge to regular functions defined along $\lbrace t = 0 \rbrace$. In addition,
we motivate the preferred direction of the approximate monotonicity by showing that the CMC-transported
spatial coordinates gauge can be viewed as a limiting version of a family of parabolic gauges for
the lapse variable; an approximate monotonicity identity and corresponding linear stability
results also hold in the parabolic gauges, but the corresponding parabolic PDEs are locally well-posed
only in the direction $t \downarrow 0$. Finally, based on the linear stability results, we outline
a proof of the following result, whose complete proof will appear elsewhere: the FLRW solution is
globally nonlinearly stable in the collapsing direction $t \downarrow 0$ under small perturbations
of its data at $\lbrace t = 1 \rbrace$.
