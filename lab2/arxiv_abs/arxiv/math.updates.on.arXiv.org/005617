Let the circle act on a 4-dimensional compact almost complex manifold $M$ with a discrete fixed point
set. Let us call the fixed point data of $M$ by the collection of multisets of weights at the fixed points.
In this paper, we give a complete classification of the fixed point data of $M$ in terms of a multigraph
encoding it. We prove that the multigraph can be achieved from a multigraph for a semi-free action
followed by a combination of 4 types of operations on it. Moreover, we prove the converse; for any
multigraph $\Gamma$ obtained from our minimal multigraph followed by the operations, we construct
a 4-dimensional compact almost complex $S^1$-manifold $M$ with a discrete fixed point set such
that $\Gamma$ encodes the fixed point data of $M$. A special case of our classification result is
when $M$ is complex or symplectic. In this case, the Todd genus of $M$ is 1 and our classification result
generalizes as a particular case the classification of the fixed point data of complex manifolds
by Carrell-Howard-Kosniowski and the classification of the fixed point data of symplectic manifolds
by Ahara-Hattori, Audin , and Karshon. As an application of our result, we determine all possible
Chern numbers of a 4-dimensional compact almost complex $S^1$-manifold $M$ with a discrete fixed
point set, answering negatively a question by Sabatini if $c_1^2[M] \leq 3c_2[M]$ holds for any
such manifold. We also provide a sharp lower bound on the number of fixed points in terms of the Todd
genus. As another application, given any possible fixed point data for a semi-free circle action
on a compact almost complex manifold with a discrete fixed point set, we construct a compact connected
almost complex $S^1$-manifold with the fixed point data.
