We study the problem of dynamic assortment personalization with large, heterogeneous populations
and wide arrays of products, and demonstrate the importance of structural priors for effective,
efficient large-scale personalization. Assortment personalization is the problem of choosing,
for each individual (type), a best assortment of products, ads, or other offerings (items) so as
to maximize revenue. This problem is central to revenue management in e-commerce and online advertising
where both items and types can number in the millions. We formulate the dynamic assortment personalization
problem as a discrete-contextual bandit with $m$ contexts (types) and exponentially many arms
(assortments of the $n$ items). We assume that each type's preferences follow a simple parametric
model with $n$ parameters. In all, there are $mn$ parameters, and existing literature suggests
that order optimal regret scales as $mn$. However, the data required to estimate so many parameters
is orders of magnitude larger than the data available in most revenue management applications;
and the optimal regret under these models is unacceptably high. In this paper, we impose a natural
structure on the problem -- a small latent dimension, or low rank. In the static setting, we show that
this model can be efficiently learned from surprisingly few interactions, using a time- and memory-efficient
optimization algorithm that converges globally whenever the model is learnable. In the dynamic
setting, we show that structure-aware dynamic assortment personalization can have regret that
is an order of magnitude smaller than structure-ignorant approaches. We validate our theoretical
results empirically.
