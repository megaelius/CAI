Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging biomedical imaging modality capable of providing both
high contrast and high resolution of optical and UltraSound (US) imaging. When a short duration
laser pulse illuminates the tissue as a target of imaging, tissue induces US waves and detected waves
can be used to reconstruct optical absorption distribution. Since receiving part of PA consists
of US waves, a large number of beamforming algorithms in US imaging can be applied on PA imaging. Delay-and-Sum
(DAS) is the most common beamforming algorithm in US imaging. However, make use of DAS beamformer
leads to low resolution images and large scale of off-axis signals contribution. To address these
problems a new paradigm namely Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS), which was used as a reconstruction
algorithm in confocal microwave imaging for breast cancer detection, was introduced for US imaging.
Consequently, DMAS was used in PA imaging systems and it was shown this algorithm results in resolution
enhancement and sidelobe degrading. However, in presence of high level of noise the reconstructed
image still suffers from high contribution of noise. In this paper, a modified version of DMAS beamforming
algorithm is proposed based on DAS inside DMAS formula expansion. The quantitative and qualitative
results show that proposed method results in more noise reduction and resolution enhancement in
expense of contrast degrading. For the simulation, two-point target, along with lateral variation
in two depths of imaging are employed and it is evaluated under high level of noise in imaging medium.
Proposed algorithm in compare to DMAS, results in reduction of lateral valley for about 19 dB followed
by more distinguished two-point target. Moreover, levels of sidelobe are reduced for about 25 dB.
