In this paper we explore the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a predator-prey model, where the prey
population is structured according to a certain life history trait. The trait distribution within
the prey population is the result of interplay between genetic inheritance and mutation, as well
as selectivity in the consumption of prey by the predator. The evolutionary processes are considered
to take place on the same time scale as ecological dynamics, i.e. we consider the evolution to be rapid.
Previously published results show that population structuring and rapid evolution in such predator-prey
system can stabilise an otherwise globally unstable dynamics even with an unlimited carrying capacity
of prey. However, those findings were only based on direct numerical simulation of equations and
obtained for particular parametrisations of model functions, which obviously calls into question
the correctness and generality of the previous results. The main objective of the current study
is to treat the model analytically and consider various parametrisations of predator selectivity
and inheritance kernel. We investigate the existence of a coexistence stationary state in the model
and carry out stability analysis of this state. We derive expressions for the Hopf bifurcation curve
which can be used for constructing bifurcation diagrams in the parameter space without the need
for a direct numerical simulation of the underlying integro-differential equations. We analytically
show the possibility of stabilisation of a globally unstable predator-prey system with prey structuring.
We prove that the coexistence stationary state is stable when the saturation in the predation term
is low. Finally, for a class of kernels describing genetic inheritance and mutation we show that
stability of the predator-prey interaction will require a selectivity of predation according
to the life trait.
