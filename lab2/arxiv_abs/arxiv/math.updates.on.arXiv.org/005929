In this paper we propose a new diffuse interface model for the numerical simulation of inviscid compressible
flows around fixed and moving solid bodies of arbitrary shape. The solids are assumed to be moving
rigid bodies, without any elastic properties. The model is a simplified case of the seven-equation
Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows, and results in a nonlinear hyperbolic
system with non-conservative products. The geometry of the solid bodies is simply specified via
a scalar field that represents the volume fraction of the fluid present in each control volume. This
allows the discretization of arbitrarily complex geometries on simple uniform or adaptive Cartesian
meshes. Inside the solid bodies, the fluid volume fraction is zero, while it is unitary in the fluid
phase. We prove that at the material interface, i.e. where the volume fraction jumps from unity to
zero, the normal component of the fluid velocity assumes the value of the normal component of the
solid velocity. This result can be directly derived from the governing equations, either via Riemann
invariants or from the generalized Rankine Hugoniot conditions according to the theory of Dal Maso,
Le Floch and Murat, which justifies the use of a path-conservative approach for treating the nonconservative
products. The governing equations of our new model are solved on uniform Cartesian grids via a high
order path-conservative ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with a posteriori sub-cell finite
volume (FV) limiter. Since the numerical method is of the shock capturing type, the fluid-solid
boundary is never explicitly tracked by the numerical method, neither via interface reconstruction,
nor via mesh motion. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a set of numerical test
problems, including 1D Riemann problems as well as supersonic flows over fixed and moving rigid
bodies.
