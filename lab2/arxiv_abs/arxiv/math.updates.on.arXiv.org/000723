Variable Coefficient Korteweg de Vries (vcKdV), Modified Korteweg de Vries (vcMKdV), and nonlinear
Schrodinger (NLS) equations have a long history dating from their derivation in various applications.
A technique based on extended Lax Pairs has been devised recently to derive variable-coefficient
generalizations of various Lax-integrable NLPDE hierarchies. The resulting Lax- or S-integrable
NLPDEs have both time- AND space-dependent coefficients, and are thus more general than almost
all cases considered earlier via other methods such as the Painlev\'e Test, Bell Polynomials, and
various similarity methods. However, this technique, although operationally effective, has
the significant disadvantage that, for any integrable system with spatiotemporally varying coefficients,
one must 'guess' a generalization of the structure of the known Lax Pair for the corresponding system
with constant coefficients. Motivated by the somewhat arbitrary nature of the above procedure,
we embark in this paper on an attempt to systematize the derivation of Lax-integrable systems with
variable coefficients. An ideal approach would be a method which does not require knowledge of the
Lax pair to an associated constant coefficient system, and also involves little to no guesswork.
Hence we attempt to apply the Estabrook-Wahlquist (EW) prolongation technique, a relatively self-consistent
procedure requiring little prior information. The new and extended EW technique which results
is illustrated by algorithmically deriving generalized Lax-integrable versions of the NLS, generalized
fifth-order KdV, MKdV, and derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) equations.
