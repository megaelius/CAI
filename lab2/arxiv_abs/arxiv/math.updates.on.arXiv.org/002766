The active bijection forms a package of results studied by the authors in a series of papers in oriented
matroids. The present paper is intended to state the main results in the particular case, and more
widespread language, of graphs. We associate any directed graph, defined on a linearly ordered
set of edges, with one particular of its spanning trees, which we call its active spanning tree. For
any graph on a linearly ordered set of edges, this yields a surjective mapping from orientations
onto spanning trees, which preserves activities (for orientations in the sense of Las Vergnas,
for spanning trees in the sense of Tutte), as well as some partitions (or filtrations) of the edge
set associated with orientations and spanning trees. It yields a canonical bijection between classes
of orientations and spanning trees, as well as a refined bijection between all orientations and
edge subsets, containing various noticeable bijections [...]. Several constructions of independent
interest are involved. The basic case concerns bipolar orientations, which are in bijection with
their fully optimal spanning trees, as proved in a previous paper, and as computed in a companion
paper. We give a canonical decomposition of a directed graph on a linearly ordered set of edges into
acyclic/cyclic bipolar directed graphs. Considering all orientations of a graph, we obtain an
expression of the Tutte polynomial in terms of products of beta invariants of minors, a remarkable
partition of the set of orientations into activity classes, and a simple expression of the Tutte
polynomial using four orientation activity parameters. We derive a similar decomposition theorem
for spanning trees. We also provide a general deletion/contraction framework for these bijections
and relatives.
