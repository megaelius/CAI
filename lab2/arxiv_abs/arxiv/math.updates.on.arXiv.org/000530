I develop a weight func theory of zero order basis func interpolants and smoothers.**Ch1 Basis funcs
and data spaces are defined using wt funcs. Data (native)spaces are used to formulate the variational
problems which define our interpolants /smoothers. Introduce the tensor prod extended B-splines.**Ch2
Prove the p'twise convergence of the minimal norm basis func interpol to its data func and obtain
orders of converg. Data func spaces for the B-splines are locally Sobolev spaces.**Ch3 Another
set of error estims for basis func interpol. Use distrib'n Taylor expansion of exp(i(a,x)).**Ch4
Derive local interpol errors for data funcs with bounded first derivs.**Ch5 Introduce class of
tensor prod wt funcs which I call the central diff wt funcs - related to the B-splines. Apply theory
to these wt funcs to obtain interpol converge results. The data func spaces are locally Sobolev spaces.
**Ch6 A non-param variat smoothing problem studied with special interest in converge of smoother
to its data func. This smoother is the min norm interpol stabilized by a smoothing coeff.**Ch7: A
non-parametric, scalable, smoothing problem shown to converge to its data func. We discuss the
software which implements these algorithms.**Ch8: Characterizes bounded linear functionals
on data space.**Ch9 Bilinear form used to characterize the bounded linear functionals on the data
spaces generated by the wt funcs.**Ch10 We derive an upper bound for the deriv of the 1-dim (scaled)
hat basis func smoother assuming the data func has bounded derivs and large supp wrt. the data region.**Ch11:
In one dim only; the local data funcs are assumed to have bounded derivs on the data region and consider
a scaled hat basis func. If the basis func has large enough supp wrt. the data region then we show the
order of converg of the interpol is 1. **Ch12: Exten ops derived based on Wloka; assumes rectangle
