A family ${\mathcal F}$ of graphs has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property if for every graph $G$, the maximum
number of pairwise disjoint subgraphs isomorphic to members of ${\mathcal F}$ contained in $G$
and the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ hitting all such subgraphs are bounded by functions
of each other. Robertson and Seymour proved that if ${\mathcal F}$ consists of $H$-minors for some
fixed graph $H$, then the planarity of $H$ is equivalent with the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. Thomas
conjectured that the planarity is no longer required if the requirement for those $H$-minors being
pairwise disjoint is replaced with being half-integrally disjoint. In this paper, we prove that
this half-integral version of Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property holds with respect to the topological
minor containment, which easily implies Thomas' conjecture. Indeed, we prove an even stronger
statement in which those subdivisions are rooted at any choice of prescribed subsets of vertices.
Precisely, we prove that for every graph $H$, there exists a function $f$ such that for every graph
$G$, every sequence $(R_v: v \in V(H))$ of subsets of $V(G)$ and every integer $k$, either there exist
$k$ subgraphs $G_1,G_2,...,G_k$ of $G$ such that every vertex of $G$ belongs to at most two of $G_1,...,G_k$
and each $G_i$ is isomorphic to a subdivision of $H$ whose branch vertex corresponding to $v$ belongs
to $R_v$ for each $v \in V(H)$, or there exists a set $Z \subseteq V(G)$ with size at most $f(k)$ intersecting
all subgraphs of $G$ isomorphic to a subdivision of $H$ whose branch vertex corresponding to $v$
belongs to $R_v$ for each $v \in V(H)$. Applications of this theorem include generalizations of
algorithmic meta-theorems and structure theorems for $H$-topological minor free (or $H$-minor
free) graphs to graphs that do not half-integrally pack many $H$-topological minors (or $H$-minors).
