It is the purpose of this article to outline a course that can be given to engineers looking for an understandable
mathematical description of the foundations of distribution theory and the necessary functional
analytic methods. Arguably, these are needed for a deeper understanding of basic questions in signal
analysis. Objects such as the Dirac delta and Dirac comb require a proper definition, and it should
be possible to explain how one can reconstruct a band-limited function from its samples by means
of simple series expansions. It should also be useful for graduate students who want to see how functional
analysis can help to understand fairly practical problems, or teachers who want to offer a course
related to the "Mathematical Foundations of Signal Processing". The course requires only an understanding
of the basic terms from linear functional analysis, namely Banach spaces and their duals, bounded
linear operators and a simple version of weak$^{*}$-convergence. As a matter of fact we use a set
of function spaces which is quite different from the collection of Lebesgue spaces used normally.
We thus avoid the use of Lebesgue integration theory. Furthermore we avoid topological vector spaces
in the form of the Schwartz space. Although all tools developed and presented can be realized on LCA
groups, we restrict our attention in the current presentation to the Euclidean setting, where we
have (generalized) functions over $R^d$. This allows us to make use of simple bounded, uniform partitions
of unity, to apply dilation operators and to make use of special functions such as the Gaussian. The
problems of the overall current situation, with the separation of theoretical Fourier Analysis
as carried out by (pure) mathematicians and Applied Fourier Analysis (as used in engineering applications)
are getting bigger and therefore courses filling the gap are in strong need.
