We address some usually overlooked issues concerning the use of $*$-algebras in quantum theory
and their physical interpretation. If $\mathfrak{A}$ is a $*$-algebra describing a quantum system
and $\omega\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathbb{C}$ a state, we focus in particular on the interpretation
of $\omega(a)$ as expectaion value for an observable $a=a^*\in\mathfrak{A}$, studying the problem
of finding a probability measure reproducing the moments $\{\omega(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$.
This problem enjoys a close relation with the self-adjointeness of the (in general only symmetric)
operator $\pi_\omega(a)$ in the GNS representation of $\omega$ and thus it has important consequences
for the interpretation of $a$ as an observable. We provide physical examples (also from QFT) where
the moment problem for $\{\omega(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ does not admit a unique solution.
To reduce this ambiguity, we consider the moment problem for the sequences $\{\omega_b(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$,
being $b\in\mathfrak{A}$ and $\omega_b(\cdot):=\omega(b^*\cdot b)$. Letting $\mu_{\omega_b}^{(a)}$
be a solution of the moment problem for the sequence $\{\omega_b(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, we
introduce a consistency relation on the family $\{\mu_{\omega_{b}}^{(a)}\}_{b\in\mathfrak{A}}$.
We prove a 1-1 correspondence between consistent families $\{\mu_{\omega_{b}}^{(a)}\}_{b\in\mathfrak{A}}$
and positive operator-valued measures (POVM) associated with the symmetric operator $\pi_\omega(a)$.
In particular there exists a unique consistent family of $\{\mu_{\omega_{b}}^{(a)}\}_{b\in\mathfrak{A}}$
if and only if $\pi_\omega(a)$ is maximally symmetric. This result suggests that a better physical
understanding of the notion of observable for general $*$-algebras should be based on POVMs rather
than projection-valued measure (PVM).
