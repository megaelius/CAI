Let $\Delta$ be an integer $n \times n$-matrix which satisfies the conditions: $\det \Delta\neq
0$, $\Delta_{ij}\leq 0\text{ for }i\neq j,$ and there exists a vector ${\bf r}=(r_1,\ldots,r_n)>0$
such that ${\bf r}\Delta \geq 0$. Here the notation ${\bf r}> 0$ means that $r_i>0$ for all
$i$, and ${\bf r}\geq {\bf r}'$ means that $r_i\geq r'_i$ for every $i$. Let $\mathscr{R}(\Delta)$
be the set of vectors ${\bf r}$ such that ${\bf r}>0$ and ${\bf r}\Delta\geq 0$. In this paper,
$(\Delta,{\bf r})$-parking functions are defined for any ${\bf r}\in\mathscr{R}(\Delta)$.
It is proved that the set of $(\Delta,{\bf r})$-parking functions is independent of ${\bf r}$ for
any ${\bf r}\in\mathscr{R}(\Delta)$. For this reason, $(\Delta,{\bf r})$-parking functions
are simply called $\Delta$-parking functions. It is shown that the number of $\Delta$-parking
functions is less than or equal to the determinant of $\Delta$. Moreover, the definition of $(\Delta,{\bf
r})$-recurrent configurations are given for any ${\bf r}\in\mathscr{R}(\Delta)$. It is proved
that the set of $(\Delta,{\bf r})$-recurrent configurations is independent of ${\bf r}$ for any
${\bf r}\in\mathscr{R}(\Delta)$. Hence, $(\Delta,{\bf r})$-recurrent configurations are
simply called $\Delta$-recurrent configurations. It is obtained that the number of $\Delta$-recurrent
configurations is larger than or equal to the determinant of $\Delta$. A simple bijection from $\Delta$-parking
functions to $\Delta$-recurrent configurations is established. It follows from this bijection
that the number of $\Delta$-parking functions and the number of $\Delta$-recurrent configurations
are both equal to the determinant of $\Delta$.
