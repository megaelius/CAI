Counting short cycles in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem of interest in the analysis and
design of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The vast majority of research in this area is focused
on algorithmic techniques. Most recently, Blake and Lin proposed a computational technique to
count the number of cycles of length $g$ in a bi-regular bipartite graph, where $g$ is the girth of
the graph. The information required for the computation is the node degree and the multiplicity
of the nodes on both sides of the partition, as well as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the
graph (graph spectrum). In this paper, we extend this result in a number of directions. First, we
derive a similar result to compute the number of cycles of length $g+2, \ldots, 2g-2$, for bi-regular
bipartite graphs. Second, using counter-examples, we demonstrate that the information of the
degree distribution and the spectrum of a bi-regular bipartite graph is, in general, insufficient
to count the cycles of length $i \geq 2g$. Third, we consider irregular bipartite graphs, and show
that, in general, the information of degree distribution and spectrum alone is not enough to determine
the number of cycles of length $i$ ($i$-cycles), for any $i > g$, regardless of the value of $g$. We
demonstrate that the same negative result also holds true for half-regular bipartite graphs, and
is also applicable to counting $g$-cycles for $g \geq 6$ and $g \geq 8$, in irregular and half-regular
graphs, respectively. As positive results, we compute the number of $4$-cycles and $6$-cycles
in irregular and half-regular bipartite graphs, with $g \geq 4$ and $g \geq 6$, respectively, using
only the degree distribution and the spectrum of the graph.
