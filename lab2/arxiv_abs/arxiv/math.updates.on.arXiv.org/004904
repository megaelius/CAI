Suppose $\mathcal I$ and $\mathcal J$ are proper ideals on some set $X$. We say that $\mathcal I$ and
$\mathcal J$ are \emph{incompatible} if $\mathcal I \cup \mathcal J$ does not generate a proper
ideal. Equivalently, $\mathcal I$ and $\mathcal J$ are incompatible if there is some $A \subseteq
X$ such that $A \in \mathcal I$ and $X \setminus A \in \mathcal J$. If some $B \subseteq X$ is either
in $\mathcal I \setminus \mathcal J$ or in $\mathcal J \setminus \mathcal I$, then we say that $B$
\emph{chooses} between $\mathcal I$ and $\mathcal J$. We consider the following Ramsey-theoretic
problem: Given several pairs $(\mathcal I_1,\mathcal J_1), (\mathcal I_2,\mathcal J_2), \dots,
(\mathcal I_k,\mathcal J_k)$ of incompatible ideals on a set $X$, find some $A \subseteq X$ that
chooses between as many of these pairs of ideals as possible. The main theorem is that for every $n
\in \mathbb N$, there is some $I(n) \in \mathbb N$ such that given at least $I(n)$ pairs of incompatible
ideals on any set $X$, there is some $A \subseteq X$ choosing between at least $n$ of them. This theorem
is proved in two steps. The first step is to identify a problem in extremal combinatorics, and to show
that our problem concerning ideals is equivalent to this combinatorial problem. The second step
is to analyze the combinatorial problem to show that the number $I(n)$ described above exists, and
to put bounds on it. We show $\textstyle \frac{1}{2}n \log_2 n - O(n) \,<\, I(n) \,<\, n \ln n + O(n).$
The upper bound is proved by considering a different but closely related combinatorial problem
involving hypergraphs, which may be of independent interest. We also investigate some applications
of this theorem to a problem concerning conditionally convergent series.
