It has long been suggested that the Cauchy horizon of dynamical black holes is subject to a weak null
singularity, under the mass inflation scenario. We study in spherical symmetry the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon
equations and we prove, assuming (sufficiently slow) decay of the charged scalar field on the event
horizon that - either mass inflation occurs on the entire Cauchy horizon emanating from time-like
infinity $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$, - or $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ is isometric to a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m
Cauchy horizon i.e. the radiation is zero on the Cauchy horizon. In both cases, we prove that $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$
is globally $C^2$-inextendible. To this end, we establish a novel classification of Cauchy horizons
into three types: dynamical, static or mixed. As a side benefit, we prove that there exists a trapped
neighborhood of the Cauchy horizon, thus the apparent horizon cannot cross the Cauchy horizon,
a result of independent interest. Our main motivation is to prove the $C^2$ Strong Cosmic Censorship
Conjecture for a realistic model of spherical collapse in which charged matter emulates the repulsive
role of angular momentum. In our case, this model is the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system
on space-times with one asymptotically flat end. As a consequence of the $C^2$-inextendibility
of the Cauchy horizon, we prove the following statements, in spherical symmetry: - two-ended asymptotically
flat space-times are $C^2$-future-inextendible i.e. $C^2$ Strong Cosmic Censorship is true for
Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon, assuming the decay of the scalar field on the event horizon at
the expected rate. - In the one-ended case, under the same assumptions, the Cauchy horizon emanating
from time-like infinity is $C^2$-inextendible. This result suppresses the main obstruction to
$C^2$ Strong Cosmic Censorship in spherical collapse.
