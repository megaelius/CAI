This note is devoted to preconditioning strategies for non-Hermitian multilevel block Toeplitz
linear systems associated with a multivariate Lebesgue integrable matrix-valued symbol. In particular,
we consider special preconditioned matrices, where the preconditioner has a band multilevel block
Toeplitz structure, and we complement known results on the localization of the spectrum with global
distribution results for the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrices. In this respect, our
main result is as follows. Let $I_k:=(-\pi,\pi)^k$, let $\mathcal M_s$ be the linear space of complex
$s\times s$ matrices, and let $f,g:I_k\to\mathcal M_s$ be functions whose components $f_{ij},\,g_{ij}:I_k\to\mathbb
C,\ i,j=1,\ldots,s,$ belong to $L^\infty$. Consider the matrices $T_n^{-1}(g)T_n(f)$, where
$n:=(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$ varies in $\mathbb N^k$ and $T_n(f),T_n(g)$ are the multilevel block Toeplitz
matrices of size $n_1\cdots n_ks$ generated by $f,g$. Then $\{T_n^{-1}(g)T_n(f)\}_{n\in\mathbb
N^k}\sim_\lambda g^{-1}f$, i.e. the family of matrices $\{T_n^{-1}(g)T_n(f)\}_{n\in\mathbb
N^k}$ has a global (asymptotic) spectral distribution described by the function $g^{-1}f$, provided
$g$ possesses certain properties (which ensure in particular the invertibility of $T_n^{-1}(g)$
for all $n$) and the following topological conditions are met: the essential range of $g^{-1}f$,
defined as the union of the essential ranges of the eigenvalue functions $\lambda_j(g^{-1}f),\
j=1,\ldots,s$, does not disconnect the complex plane and has empty interior. This result generalizes
the one obtained by Donatelli, Neytcheva, Serra-Capizzano in a previous work, concerning the non-preconditioned
case $g=1$. The last part of this note is devoted to numerical experiments, which confirm the theoretical
analysis and suggest the choice of optimal GMRES preconditioning techniques to be used for the considered
linear systems.
