This paper is concerned with the relationship between forward-backward stochastic Volterra integral
equations (FBSVIEs, for short) and a system of (non-local in time) path dependent partial differential
equations (PPDEs, for short). Due to the nature of Volterra type equations, the usual flow property
(or semigroup property) does not hold. Inspired by Viens-Zhang \cite{Viens-Zhang-2019} and Wang-Yong
\cite{Wang-Yong-2019}, auxiliary processes are introduced so that the flow property of adapted
solutions to the FBSVIEs is recovered in a suitable sense, and thus the functional It\^o's formula
is applicable. Having achieved this stage, a natural PPDE is found so that the adapted solution of
the backward SVIEs admits a representation in terms of the solution to the forward SVIE via the solution
to a PPDE. On the other hand, the solution of the PPDE admits a representation in terms of adapted solution
to the (path dependent) FBSVIE, which is referred to as a Feynman-Kac formula. This leads to the existence
and uniqueness of a classical solution to the PPDE, under smoothness conditions on the coefficients
of the FBSVIEs. Further, when the smoothness conditions are relaxed with the backward component
of FBSVIE being one-dimensional, a new (and suitable) notion of viscosity solution is introduced
for the PPDE, for which a comparison principle of the viscosity solutions is established, leading
to the uniqueness of the viscosity solution. Finally, some results have been extended to coupled
FBSVIEs and type-II BSVIEs, and a representation formula for the path derivatives of PPDE solution
is obtained by a closer investigation of linear FBSVIEs.
