We consider codes of length $m$ over an alphabet of size $q$ as subsets of the vertex set of the Hamming
graph $\Gamma=H(m,q)$. A code for which there exists an automorphism group $X\leq Aut(\Gamma)$
that acts transitively on the code and on its set of neighbours is said to be neighbour transitive,
and were introduced by the authors as a group theoretic analogue to the assumption that single errors
are equally likely over a noisy channel. Examples of neighbour transitive codes include the Hamming
codes, various Golay codes, certain Hadamard codes, the Nordstrom Robinson codes, certain permutation
codes and frequency permutation arrays, which have connections with powerline communication,
and also completely transitive codes, a subfamily of completely regular codes, which themselves
have attracted a lot of interest. It is known that for any neighbour transitive code with minimum
distance at least 3 there exists a subgroup of $X$ that has a $2$-transitive action on the alphabet
over which the code is defined. Therefore, by Burnside's theorem, this action is of almost simple
or affine type. If the action is of almost simple type, we say the code is alphabet almost simple neighbour
transitive. In this paper we characterise a family of neighbour transitive codes, in particular,
the alphabet almost simple neighbour transitive codes with minimum distance at least $3$, and for
which the group $X$ has a non-trivial intersection with the base group of $Aut(\Gamma)$. If $C$ is
such a code, we show that, up to equivalence, there exists a subcode $\Delta$ that can be completely
described, and that either $C=\Delta$, or $\Delta$ is a neighbour transitive frequency permutation
array and $C$ is the disjoint union of $X$-translates of $\Delta$. We also prove that any finite group
can be identified in a natural way with a neighbour transitive code.
