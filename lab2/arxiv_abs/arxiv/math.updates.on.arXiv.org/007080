The effects of quantization and coding on the estimation quality of Gauss-Markov processes are
considered, with a special attention to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Samples are acquired
from the process, quantized, and then encoded for transmission using either infinite incremental
redundancy (IIR) or fixed redundancy (FR) coding schemes. A fixed processing time is consumed at
the receiver for decoding and sending feedback to the transmitter. Decoded messages are used to
construct a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the process as a function of time. This is
shown to be an increasing functional of the age-of-information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed
since the sampling time pertaining to the latest successfully decoded message. Such (age-penalty)
functional depends on the quantization bits, codewords lengths and receiver processing time.
The goal, for each coding scheme, is to optimize sampling times such that the long-term average MMSE
is minimized. This is then characterized in the setting of general increasing age-penalty functionals,
not necessarily corresponding to MMSE, which may be of independent interest in other contexts.
The solution is first shown to be a threshold policy for IIR, and a just-in-time policy for FR. Enhanced
transmissions schemes are then developed in order to exploit the processing times to make new data
available at the receiver sooner. For both IIR and FR, it is shown that there exists an optimal number
of quantization bits that balances AoI and quantization errors. It is also shown that for longer
receiver processing times, the relatively simpler FR scheme outperforms IIR.
