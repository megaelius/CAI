Using the framework of the quantum separation of variables (SoV) for higher rank quantum integrable
lattice models [1], we introduce some foundations to go beyond the obtained complete transfer matrix
spectrum description, and open the way to the computation of matrix elements of local operators.
This first amounts to obtain simple expressions for scalar products of the so-called separate states
(transfer matrix eigenstates or some simple generalization of them). In the higher rank case, left
and right SoV bases are expected to be pseudo-orthogonal, that is for a given SoV co-vector, there
could be more than one non-vanishing overlap with the vectors of the chosen right SoV basis. For simplicity,
we describe our method to get these pseudo-orthogonality overlaps in the fundamental representations
of the $\mathcal{Y}(gl_3)$ lattice model with $N$ sites, a case of rank 2. The non-zero couplings
between the co-vector and vector SoV bases are exactly characterized. While the corresponding
SoV-measure stays reasonably simple and of possible practical use, we address the problem of constructing
left and right SoV bases which do satisfy standard orthogonality. In our approach, the SoV bases
are constructed by using families of conserved charges. This gives us a large freedom in the SoV bases
construction, and allows us to look for the choice of a family of conserved charges which leads to
orthogonal co-vector/vector SoV bases. We first define such a choice in the case of twist matrices
having simple spectrum and zero determinant. Then, we generalize the associated family of conserved
charges and orthogonal SoV bases to generic simple spectrum and invertible twist matrices. Under
this choice of conserved charges, and of the associated orthogonal SoV bases, the scalar products
of separate states simplify considerably and take a form similar to the $\mathcal{Y}(gl_2)$ rank
one case.
