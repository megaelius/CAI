Standard optical phase-metrology fringe-patterns are digitized with XxY pixels and 8 bits/pixel
(or higher) gray-levels. The digitized 8 bits/pixel are raw-data bits, not Shannon information
bits. Here we show that noisy digital fringe-patterns store much lower amount of Shannon information
than the capacity of the digitizing camera. This means that high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cameras
may waste to noise most bits/pixel. On the other hand, one would hardly use smartphone cameras for
quality phase-metrology, because of their lower (S/N) images. However smartphones digitize high-resolution
(12 megapixel) images. In communications theory, the standard formalism for measuring information
are the Shannon-entropy H, and Shannon capacity theorem (SCT). According to SCT, low (S/N) may be
compensated with large fringe-bandwidth to obtain high-precision phase measurements. So large
bandwidth fringes may be used for quality phase-measurements, in spite of low (S/N). Most natural
video images are highly redundant because they usually have large smooth zones where the pixel-value
do not change much. So data compression algorithms for image and video transmission and storage
are paramount. Shannon's capacity is used to gauge competing compression algorithms. We also use
Kolmogorov's entropy theorem, to show that a sequence of phase-shifted fringes, store low amounts
of information because they are highly correlated. We also show that phase-shifting algorithms
(PSAs) may be regarded as efficient fringe-data compression algorithms. Therefore a large number
of phase-shifted fringes may be packed into a single complex-valued image. This is very important
in spaceborne optical/RADAR phase-telemetry where downlink is severely limited by huge distance
and low-power radio transmission.
