This is the third prepublication version of a book on derived categories, that will be published
by Cambridge University Press. The purpose of the book is to provide solid foundations for the theory
of derived categories, and to present several applications of this theory in commutative and noncommutative
algebra. The emphasis is on constructions and examples, rather than on axiomatics. Here are the
topics covered in the book: - A review of standard facts on abelian categories. - Differential graded
algebra (DG rings, DG modules, DG categories and DG functors). - Triangulated categories and triangulated
functors between them. How they arise from the DG background. The homotopy category K(A,M) of DG
A-modules in M. - Localization of categories. The derived category D(A,M), which is the localization
of K(A,M) with respect to the quasi-isomorphisms. - Left and right derived functors of a triangulated
functor. - K-injective, K-projective and K-flat DG modules. Their roles, and their existence in
several important algebraic situations. - Dualizing and residue complexes over commutative noetherian
rings, including Van den Bergh rigidity. - Perfect DG modules and tilting DG bimodules over NC (noncommutative)
DG rings. - NC connected graded rings, including Artin-Schelter regular rings. Derived torsion
for NC connected graded rings, its relation to the chi condition of Artin-Zhang, and the NC MGM Equivalence.
Balanced dualizing complexes, their uniqueness, existence and trace functoriality. - NC rigid
dualizing complexes, following Van den Bergh. The uniqueness and existence of these complexes,
a few examples, and their relation to Calabi-Yau rings. Readers of this preview version are urged
to write to the author with any comments regarding errors, suggestions or questions.
