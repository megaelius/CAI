We formulate a novel characterization of a family of invertible maps between two-dimensional domains.
Our work follows two classic results: The Rad\'o-Kneser-Choquet (RKC) theorem, which establishes
the invertibility of harmonic maps into a convex planer domain; and Tutte's embedding theorem for
planar graphs - RKC's discrete counterpart - which proves the invertibility of piecewise linear
maps of triangulated domains satisfying a discrete-harmonic principle, into a convex planar polygon.
In both theorems, the convexity of the target domain is essential for ensuring invertibility. We
extend these characterizations, in both the continuous and discrete cases, by replacing convexity
with a less restrictive condition. In the continuous case, Alessandrini and Nesi provide a characterization
of invertible harmonic maps into non-convex domains with a smooth boundary by adding additional
conditions on orientation preservation along the boundary. We extend their results by defining
a condition on the normal derivatives along the boundary, which we call the cone condition; this
condition is tractable and geometrically intuitive, encoding a weak notion of local invertibility.
The cone condition enables us to extend Alessandrini and Nesi to the case of harmonic maps into non-convex
domains with a piecewise-smooth boundary. In the discrete case, we use an analog of the cone condition
to characterize invertible discrete-harmonic piecewise-linear maps of triangulations. This
gives an analog of our continuous results and characterizes invertible discrete-harmonic maps
in terms of the orientation of triangles incident on the boundary.
