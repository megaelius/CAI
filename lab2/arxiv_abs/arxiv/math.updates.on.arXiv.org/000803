We focus on the distribution regression problem: regressing to a real-valued response from a probability
distribution. Although there exist a large number of similarity measures between distributions,
very little is known about their generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning
problems formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice
only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities
computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency
guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate
step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the domain of the distributions
to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple
algorithmic alternative to solve the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions
to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs.
Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage sampled setting
under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed with kernels). For a given total
number of observations, we derive convergence rates as an explicit function of the problem difficulty.
As a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the consistency of the classical
set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gartner et. al, 2002] in regression, and cover more recent kernels on
distributions, including those due to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].
