This paper develops tools to obtain robust probabilistic estimates for queueing models at the large
deviations (LD) scale. These tools are based on the recently introduced robust R\'enyi bounds,
which provide LD estimates (and more generally risk-sensitive (RS) cost estimates) that hold uniformly
over an uncertainty class of models, provided that the class is defined in terms of R\'enyi divergence
with respect to a reference model and that estimates are available for the reference model. One very
attractive quality of the approach is that the class to which the estimates apply may consist of hard
models, such as highly non-Markovian models and ones for which the LD principle is not available.
Our treatment provides exact expressions as well as bounds on the R\'enyi divergence rate on families
of marked point processes, including as a special case renewal processes. Another contribution
is a general result that translates robust RS control problems, where robustness is formulated
via R\'enyi divergence, to finite dimensional convex optimization problems, when the control
set is a finite dimensional convex set. The implications to queueing are vast, as they apply in great
generality. This is demonstrated on two non-Markovian queueing models. One is the multiclass single-server
queue considered as a RS control problem, with scheduling as the control process and exponential
weighted queue length as cost. The second is the many-server queue with reneging, with the probability
of atypically large reneging count as performance criterion. As far as LD analysis is concerned,
no robust estimates or non-Markovian treatment were previously available for either of these models.
