This work deals with the modeling of nonsmooth impacting motions of a structure against a rigid distributed
obstacle. Finite element methods can be used to discretize the structure, and this results in a system
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). When these ODEs are subjected to unilateral constraints
and velocity jump conditions, one has to use an event detection algorithm to calculate the time of
impact accurately. Event detection in the presence of multiple simultaneous impacts is a nontrivial
and computationally demanding task. Ivanov (Ivanov, A., 1993. 'Analytical methods in the theory
of vibro-impact systems', Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, 57(2), pp. 221-236.)
proposed a nonsmooth transformation for a vibro-impacting multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system
subjected to only a single unilateral constraint. This transformation eliminates the unilateral
constraints from the problem and, therefore, no event detection is required during numerical integration.
This nonsmooth transformation leads to sign function nonlinearities in the equations of motion.
However, they can be easily accounted for during numerical integration. Ivanov used his transformation
to make analytical calculations for the stability and bifurcations of vibro-impacting motions
but did not explore its application to simulating distributed collisions in discretized continuous
structures. We adopt the Ivanov transformation to deal with multiple unilateral constraints in
discretized continuous structures. The developed method is demonstrated by modeling the distributed
collision of a string and a beam against a rigid surface. For validation, we compare our results with
the penalty approach.
