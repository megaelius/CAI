We construct abelian model structures on the category of chain complexes over a ring $R$, from the
notion homological dimensions of modules. We deduce that the classes $\widetilde{\mathcal{P}_n}$
and ${\rm dg}\widetilde{\mathcal{P}_n}$ of $n$-projective and differential graded $n$-projective
complexes, for every integer $n > 0$, are the classes of trivially cofibrant and cofibrant objects
of a model structure, respectively, after proving that the $n$-projective left modules over a ringoid
$\mathfrak{R}$ form the left half of a complete cotorsion pair. We prove that the same result is also
valid for the classes of $\widetilde{\mathcal{F}_n}$ and ${\rm dg}\widetilde{\mathcal{F}_n}$
of $n$-flat and differential graded $n$-flat complexes, by generalizing some arguments given
in the paper "Envelopes and Covers by Modules of Finite Injective and Projective Dimensions". In
the paper "Cotorsion pairs in C($R$-Mod)", the authors construct an abelian model structure on
chain complexes, where the trivial objects are the exact complexes and the class of cofibrant objects
is given by the complexes which are degreewise projective. We generalize some of their methods by
using an extension of a well known theorem by I. Kaplansky, in order to obtain a new abelian model structure
where the class of (trivially) cofibrant objects is the class of (resp. exact) complexes whose terms
are $n$-projective. To obtain the analogous model structure from the flat dimension, we adapt some
arguments given in "Envelopes and Covers by Modules of Finite Injective and Projective Dimensions"
to show that every exact degreewise $n$-flat complex is filtered by the set of exact degreewise $n$-flat
complexes with cardinality $\leq \kappa$, with $\kappa$ a fixed infinite cardinal $\geq {\rm Card}(R)$.
