In previous work, the first and third authors introduced staircase tableaux, which they used to
give combinatorial formulas for the stationary distribution of the asymmetric simple exclusion
process (ASEP) and for the moments of the Askey-Wilson weight function. The fact that the ASEP and
Askey-Wilson moments are related at all is quite surprising, and is due to Uchiyama-Sasamoto-Wadati.
The ASEP is a model of particles hopping on a one-dimensional lattice of N sites with open boundaries,
particles can enter and exit at both left and right borders. It was introduced around 1970 and is cited
as a model for both traffic flow and translation in protein synthesis. Meanwhile, the Askey-Wilson
polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials in one variable, they sit at the top of the hierarchy
of classical orthogonal polynomials. So we have the relationship ASEP -- staircase tableaux --
Askey-Wilson moments It is well-known that Askey-Wilson polynomials can be viewed as the one-variable
case of the multivariate Koornwinder polynomials, also known as the Macdonald polynomials for
the type BC root system. It is natural then to ask whether one can generalize the relationships among
the ASEP, Askey-Wilson moments, and staircase tableaux, in such a way that Koornwinder moments
replace Askey-Wilson moments. In a recent work, we demonstrated a close connection between Koornwinder
moments and the two-species ASEP (a particle model involving two species of particles with different
"weights"). In this article we introduce rhombic staircase tableaux, and show that we have the relationship
2-species ASEP -- rhombic staircase tableaux -- Koornwinder moments In particular, we give formulas
for the steady state distribution of the two-species ASEP and for Koornwinder moments, in terms
of rhombic staircase tableaux.
