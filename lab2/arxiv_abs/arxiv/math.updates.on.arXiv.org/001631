Given a hypergraph $H = (V,E)$ and an integer parameter $k$, a coloring of $V$ is said to be $k$-conflict-free
($k$-CF in short) if for every hyperedge $S \in E$, there exists a color with multiplicity at most
$k$ in $S$. A $k$-CF coloring of a graph is a $k$-CF coloring of the hypergraph induced by the (closed
or punctured) neighborhoods of its vertices. The special case of $1$-CF coloring of general graphs
and hypergraphs has been studied extensively. In this paper we study $k$-CF coloring of graphs and
hypergraphs. First, we study the non-geometric case and prove that any hypergraph with $n$ vertices
and $m$ hyperedges can be $k$-CF colored with $\tilde{O}(m^{\frac{1}{k+1}})$ colors. This bound,
which extends theorems of Cheilaris and of Pach and Tardos (2009), is tight, up to a logarithmic factor.
Next, we study {\em string graphs}. We consider several families of string graphs on $n$ vertices
for which the $1$-CF chromatic number w.r.t. punctured neighborhoods is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ (which
is the maximum possible for any graph with $n$ vertices), and show that they admit a $k$-CF coloring
with only $O(\log n)$ colors for very small constant parameters $k>1$. We then focus on $k=1$ and
prove that any string graph on $n$ strings with chromatic number bounded by $t$ admits a $1$-CF coloring
with $O(t^2 \log n)$ colors w.r.t. punctured neighborhoods; this bound is asymptotically sharp
in $n$. Finally, we show that for a large class of string graphs, which includes intersection graphs
of frames and of boundaries of pseudo-discs, the $1$-CF chromatic number w.r.t. closed neighborhoods
can be bounded in terms of the graph's packing number.
