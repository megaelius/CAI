We are concerned with the global existence theory for spherically symmetric solutions of the M-D
compressible Euler equations with large initial data of positive far-field density. The central
feature of the solutions is the strengthening of waves as they move radially inward toward the origin.
Various examples have shown that the spherically symmetric solutions of the Euler equations blow
up near the origin at certain time. A fundamental unsolved problem is whether the density of the global
solution would form concentration to become a measure near the origin when the total initial-energy
is unbounded. Another longstanding problem is whether a rigorous proof could be provided for the
inviscid limit of the M-D compressible Navier-Stokes to Euler equations with large initial data.
In this paper, we establish a global existence theory for spherically symmetric solutions of the
compressible Euler equations with large initial data of positive far-field density and relative
finite-energy. This is achieved by developing a new approach via adapting a class of degenerate
density-dependent viscosity terms, so that a rigorous proof of the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes
equations with the density-dependent viscosity terms to the Euler equations with large initial
data of spherical symmetry and positive far-field density can be obtained. One of our main observations
is that the adapted class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms not only includes the
viscosity terms for the Navier-Stokes equations for shallow water flows but also, more importantly,
is suitable to achieve our key objective of this paper. These results indicate that concentration
is not formed in the vanishing viscosity limit even when the total initial-energy is unbounded.
