Deterministic interpolation and quadrature methods are often unsuitable to address Bayesian
inverse problems depending on computationally expensive forward mathematical models. While
interpolation may give precise posterior approximations, deterministic quadrature is usually
unable to efficiently investigate an informative and thus concentrated likelihood. This leads
to a large number of required expensive evaluations of the mathematical model. To overcome these
challenges, we formulate and test a multilevel adaptive sparse Leja algorithm. At each level, adaptive
sparse grid interpolation and quadrature are used to approximate the posterior and perform all
quadrature operations, respectively. Specifically, our algorithm uses coarse discretizations
of the underlying mathematical model to investigate the parameter space and to identify areas of
high posterior probability. Adaptive sparse grid algorithms are then used to place points in these
areas, and ignore other areas of small posterior probability. The points are weighted Leja points.
As the model discretization is coarse, the construction of the sparse grid is computationally efficient.
On this sparse grid, the posterior measure can be approximated accurately with few expensive, fine
model discretizations. The efficiency of the algorithm can be enhanced further by exploiting more
than two discretization levels. We apply the proposed multilevel adaptive sparse Leja algorithm
in numerical experiments involving elliptic inverse problems in 2D and 3D space, in which we compare
it with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and a standard multilevel approximation.
