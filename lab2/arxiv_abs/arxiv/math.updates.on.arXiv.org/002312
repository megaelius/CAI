In this article, we prove that the equivalence class of a superpotential up to formal change of variables,
is determined by its superpotential algebra (Jacobi algebra) together with the class in its 0-th
Hochschild homology represented by the superpotential assuming it is finite dimen- sional. This
result can be viewed as a noncommutative analogue of the famous theorem of Mather and Yau on isolated
hypersurface singularities. We also prove that the equivalence class of a superpotential is determined
by its sufficiently high jet assuming the superpotential algebra is finite dimensional. These
results have several interesting applications. First, we show that if the superpotential algebra
is finite dimensional then the corresponding complete Ginzburg dg-algebra, and the (topological)
generalized cluster category thereof, are determined by the isomorphic type of the superpotential
algebra together with the class in its 0-th Hochschild homology represented by the superpotential.
The contraction algebras associated to three di- mensional flopping contractions provide a class
of examples of finite dimensional superpotential algebras (with at most 2 loops). As the second
application, we prove that the contraction algebra together with the class in its 0-th Hochschild
homology represented by the superpotential determines the relative singularity category defined
by Kalck and Yang and the classical singu- larity category. This result provides an evidence for
Donovan-Wemyss conjecture, which asserts that the contraction algebra is a complete invariant
for the underlying singularities of three dimensional flopping contractions.
