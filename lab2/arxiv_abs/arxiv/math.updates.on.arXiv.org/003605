Locally repairable convolutional codes (LRCCs) for distributed storage systems (DSSs) are introduced
in this work. They enable local repair, for a single node erasure, and sliding-window global repair,
which can correct up to $ {\rm d}^c_j - 1 $ node erasures in a window of $ j+1 $ consecutive blocks of $
n $ nodes, where $ {\rm d}^c_j $ is the $ j $th column distance of the code. The parameter $ j $ can be adjusted,
for a fixed LRCC, according to different catastrophic erasure patterns, requiring only to contact
$ n(j+1) - {\rm d}^c_j + 1 $ nodes, plus less than $ \mu n $ other nodes, in the storage system, where $
\mu $ is the memory of the code. A Singleton-type bound is provided for $ {\rm d}^c_j $. If it attains
such a bound, an LRCC can correct the same number of catastrophic erasures in a window of length $ n(j+1)
$ as an optimal locally repairable block code of the same rate and locality, and with block length
$ n(j+1) $, but being able to perform the flexible and somehow local sliding-window repair by adjusting
$ j $. Furthermore, by sliding the window to consider previous or consequent nodes without erasures,
or by increasing the window size, the LRCC can potentially correct more erasures in the original
window of $ n(j+1) $ nodes than the optimal locally repairable block code. Finally, the concept of
partial maximum distance profile (partial MDP) codes is introduced. Partial MDP codes can correct
all information-theoretically correctable erasure patterns for a given locality, local distance
and information rate. An explicit construction of partial MDP codes whose column distances attain
the provided Singleton-type bound, up to certain parameter $ j=L $, is obtained based on known maximum
sum-rank distance convolutional codes.
