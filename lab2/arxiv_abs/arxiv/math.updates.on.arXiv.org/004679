The aim of this set of notes is to explain and unify some work by Tanaka [1], Lohe [2] and Chandra et~al.~[3,
4] on a generalization of Kuramoto oscillator networks to the case of higher dimensional ``oscillators.''
Instead of oscillators represented by points on the unit circle $S^1$ in ${\Bbb R}^2$, the individual
units in the network are represented by points on a higher dimensional unit sphere $S^{d-1}$ in ${\Bbb
R}^d$. Tanaka demonstrates in his 2014 paper that the dynamics of such a system can be reduced using
M\"obius transformations, similar to the classic case when $d = 2$ [5]. Tanaka also presents a generalization
of the famous Ott-Antonsen reduction for the complex version of the system [9]. Lohe derives a similar
reduction using M\"obius transformations for the finite-$N$ model, whereas Chandra et~al.~concentrate
on the infinite-$N$ or continuum limit system, and derive a dynamical reduction for a special class
of probability densities on $S^{d-1}$, generalizing the Poisson densities used in the Ott-Antonsen
reduction. The oscillator systems studied in [1]--[4] are intimately related to the natural hyperbolic
geometry on the unit ball $B^d$ in ${\Bbb R}^d$; as we shall show, once this connection is realized,
the reduced dynamics, evolution by M\"obius transformations and the form of the special densities
in [3] and [4] all follow naturally. This framework also allows one to see the seamless connection
between the finite and infinite-$N$ cases. In addition, we shall show that special cases of these
networks have gradient dynamics with respect to the hyperbolic metric, and so their dynamics are
especially easy to describe.
