In this thesis, we study three physically relevant models of strongly correlated random variables:
trapped fermions, random matrices and random walks. In the first part, we show several exact mappings
between the ground state of a trapped Fermi gas and ensembles of random matrix theory. The Fermi gas
is inhomogeneous in the trapping potential and in particular there is a finite edge beyond which
its density vanishes. Going beyond standard semi-classical techniques (such as local density
approximation), we develop a precise description of the spatial statistics close to the edge. This
description holds for a large universality class of hard edge potentials. We apply these results
to compute the statistics of the position of the fermion the farthest away from the centre of the trap,
the number of fermions in a given domain (full counting statistics) and the related bipartite entanglement
entropy. Our analysis also provides solutions to open problems of extreme value statistics in random
matrix theory. We obtain for instance a complete description of the fluctuations of the largest
eigenvalue in the complex Ginibre ensemble. In the second part of the thesis, we study extreme value
questions for random walks. We consider the gap statistics, which requires to take explicitly into
account the discreteness of the process. This question cannot be solved using the convergence of
the process to its continuous counterpart, the Brownian motion. We obtain explicit analytical
results for the gap statistics of the walk with a Laplace distribution of jumps and provide numerical
evidence suggesting the universality of these results.
