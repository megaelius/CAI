We present new connections among anomalous diffusion (AD), normal diffusion (ND) and the Central
Limit Theorem. This is done by defining a point transformation to a new position variable, which
we postulate to be Cartesian, motivated by considerations from super-symmetric quantum mechanics.
Canonically quantizing in the new position and momentum variables according to Dirac gives rise
to generalized negative semi-definite and self-adjoint Laplacian operators. These lead to new
generalized Fourier transformations and associated probability distributions, which are form
invariant under the corresponding transform. The new Laplacians also lead us to generalized diffusion
equations, which imply a connection to the CLT. We show that the derived diffusion equations capture
all of the Fractal and Non-Fractal Diffusion equations of O'Shaughnessy and Procaccia. However,
we also obtain new equations that cannot (so far as we are able to tell) be expressed as examples of
the O'Shaughnessy and Procaccia equations. These equations also possess asymptotics that are
related to a CLT but with bi-modal distributions as limits. The results show, in part, that experimentally
measuring the diffusion scaling law can determine the point transformation (for monomial point
transformations). We also show that AD in the original, physical position is actually ND when viewed
in terms of displacements in an appropriately transformed position variable. Finally, we show
that there is a new, anomalous diffusion possible for bi-modal probability distributions that
also display attractor behavior which is the consequence of an underlying CLT.
