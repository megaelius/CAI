This paper presents a sharp geometric analysis of the recovery performance of sparse regularization.
More specifically, we analyze the BLASSO method which estimates a sparse measure (sum of Dirac masses)
from randomized sub-sampled measurements. This is a "continuous", often called off-the-grid,
extension of the compressed sensing problem, where the $\ell^1$ norm is replaced by the total variation
of measures. This extension is appealing from a numerical perspective because it avoids to discretize
the the space by some grid. But more importantly, it makes explicit the geometry of the problem since
the positions of the Diracs can now freely move over the parameter space. On a methodological level,
our contribution is to propose the Fisher geodesic distance on this parameter space as the canonical
metric to analyze super-resolution in a way which is invariant to reparameterization of this space.
Switching to the Fisher metric allows us to take into account measurement operators which are not
translation invariant, which is crucial for applications such as Laplace inversion in imaging,
Gaussian mixtures estimation and training of multilayer perceptrons with one hidden layer. On
a theoretical level, our main contribution shows that if the Fisher distance between spikes is larger
than a Rayleigh separation constant, then the BLASSO recovers in a stable way a stream of Diracs,
provided that the number of measurements is proportional (up to log factors) to the number of Diracs.
We measure the stability using an optimal transport distance constructed on top of the Fisher geodesic
distance. Our result is (up to log factor) sharp and does not require any randomness assumption on
the amplitudes of the underlying measure. Our proof technique relies on an infinite-dimensional
extension of the so-called "golfing scheme" which operates over the space of measures and is of general
interest.
