We will discuss the model of the overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity, which is given
by a family of first order non-linear ordinary differential equations on two-torus depending on
three parameters: a fixed parameter $\omega$ (the frequency); a pair of variable parameters $(B,A)$
(abscissa and ordinate). It is important to study the rotation number of the system as a function
$\rho=\rho(B,A)$ and to describe the phase-lock areas: its level sets $L_r=\{\rho =r\}$ with non-empty
interiors. They were studied by V.M.Buchstaber, O.V.Karpov, S.I.Tertychnyi, who observed in
2010 that the phase-lock areas exist only for integer values of the rotation number. It is known that
each phase-lock area is a garland of infinitely many bounded domains going to infinity in the vertical
direction; each two subsequent domains are separated by one point called constriction. There is
a conjecture stating that all the constrictions of every phase-lock area $L_r$ lie in its axis $\Lambda_r=\{
B=r\omega\}$. Another conjecture states that for any two subsequent constrictions in $L_r$ with
positive ordinates the interval between them also lies in $L_r$. In the present paper we give new
results partially confirming both conjectures. The main result states that the intersection $L_r\cap\Lambda_r$
contains an explicit infinite interval of the axis $\Lambda_r$ (conjecturally a connected component
of the latter intersection). The proof is done by studying an equivalent family of systems of second
order linear differential equations on the Riemann sphere. We obtain new results on the transition
matrix between appropriate canonical solution bases of the linear system and deduce the main result
on non-linear systems on two-torus.
