The manuscript is devoted to the construction of $\Psi^\star$- algebras containing the Bergman
projection on the unit ball $B_n$ of $\mathbb C^n$. We consider the $C^\star$-algebra $\mathcal{L}(L^2(B_n))$
of bounded operator acting on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on $B_n$ with respect
to the standard probability measure. We search for spectral invariant Fr\'{e}chet subalgebras
of $\mathcal{L}(L^2(B_n))$ containing the Bergman projection $P$ which is defined on $L^2(B_n)$
with values in the space of holomorphic functions. We use the commutator method as introduced by
Gramsch. This method generalizes the work of Beals for the spectral invariance of pseudodifferential
operators. One need not to work on the H\"{o}rmander classes but can describe the algebra of pseudodifferential
operators as continuous commutator between scales of Sobolev spaces. To connect the analytical
properties to the geometry of the unit ball, we search for linear tangent vector fields $X$ on the
the unit sphere $\partial B_n$ so that the commutator $[X,P]$ has a continuous extension to $L^2(B_n)$.
In comparison to the work of Bauer in for the case of the Fischer-Fock space it turns out that the results
are completely different. Our first contribution states that the set of vector fields which provides
the $\Psi^\star$-algebra for the Fock space fails even to provide a continuity with the Bergman
projection in the case of the unit ball. Our second contribution, is the construction of vector fields
being tangent to the unit sphere which provides a new $\Psi^\star$-algebra containing the Bergman
projection of the unit ball. We prove that every linear vector field on the unit sphere commutes with
the Bergman projection on the unit ball.
