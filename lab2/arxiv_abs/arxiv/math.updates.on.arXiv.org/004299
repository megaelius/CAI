We explore various 4d Yang-Mills gauge theories (YM) living as boundary conditions of 5d gapped
short/long-range entangled (SRE/LRE) topological states. Specifically, we explore 4d time-reversal
symmetric pure YM of an SU(2) gauge group with a second-Chern-class topological term at $\theta=\pi$
(SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$ YM), by turning on background fields of both time reversal (i.e., on unorientable
manifolds) and 1-form center global symmetry. We find "Fantastic Four Siblings" of SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$
YM with distinct couplings to background fields, labeled by $(K_1, K_2)$: $K_1=0,1$ specifies
Kramers singlet/doublet Wilson line and new mixed higher 't Hooft anomalies; $K_2=0,1$ specifies
boson/fermionic Wilson line and a new Wess-Zumino-Witten-like counterterm. Higher anomalies
indicate that the 4d SU(2)$_{\theta=\pi}$ YM, in order to realize all higher global symmetries
locally, necessarily couples to a 5d higher symmetry-protected topological state (SPTs, as an
invertible-TQFT, or as a 5d higher symmetric interacting "topological superconductor"). Via
Weyl's gauge principle, by dynamically gauging the 1-form symmetry, we transform a 5d bulk SRE SPTs
into an LRE symmetry-enriched topologically ordered state (SETs); thus we obtain the 4d SO(3)$_{\theta=\pi}$
YM-5d LRE-higher-SETs coupled system with dynamical higher-form gauge fields. We further derive
new exotic anyonic statistics of extended objects such as 2-worldsheet of strings and 3-worldvolume
of branes, physically characterizing the 5d SETs. We discover triple and quadruple link invariants
potentially associated with the underlying 5d higher-gauge TQFTs, hinting a new intrinsic relation
between non-supersymmetric 4d pure YM and topological links in 5d. We provide 4d-5d lattice simplicial
complex regularizations and bridge to 4d SU(2) and SO(3)-gauged quantum spin liquids as 3+1 dimensional
condensed matter realizations.
