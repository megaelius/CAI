A significant portion of electricity consumed worldwide is used to power thermostatically controlled
loads (TCLs) such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and water heaters. Because the short-term
timing of operation of such systems is inconsequential as long as their long-run average power consumption
is maintained, they are increasingly used in demand response (DR) programs to balance supply and
demand on the power grid. Here, we present an \textit{ab initio} phase model for general TCLs, and
use the concept to develop a continuous oscillator model of a TCL and compute its phase response to
changes in temperature and applied power. This yields a simple control system model that can be used
to evaluate control policies for modulating the power consumption of aggregated loads with parameter
heterogeneity and stochastic drift. We demonstrate this concept by comparing simulations of ensembles
of heterogeneous loads using the continuous state model and an established hybrid state model.
The developed phase model approach is a novel means of evaluating DR provision using TCLs, and is
instrumental in estimating the capacity of ancillary services or DR on different time scales. We
further propose a novel phase response based open-loop control policy that effectively modulates
the aggregate power of a heterogeneous TCL population while maintaining load diversity and minimizing
power overshoots. This is demonstrated by low-error tracking of a regulation signal by filtering
it into frequency bands and using TCL sub-ensembles with duty cycles in corresponding ranges. Control
policies that can maintain a uniform distribution of power consumption by aggregated heterogeneous
loads will enable distribution system management (DSM) approaches that maintain stability as
well as power quality, and further allow more integration of renewable energy sources.
