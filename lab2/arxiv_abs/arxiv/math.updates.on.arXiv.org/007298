We consider an online assortment problem with $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ sellers, each holding
exactly one item $i\in[n]$ with initial inventory $c_i\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, and a sequence of homogeneous
buyers arriving over a finite time horizon $t=1,2,\ldots,m$. There is an online platform whose
goal is to offer a subset $S_t\subseteq [n]$ of sellers to the arriving buyer at time $t$ to maximize
the expected revenue derived over the entire horizon while respecting the inventory constraints.
Given an assortment $S_t$ at time $t$, it is assumed that the buyer will select an item from $S_t$ based
on the well-known multinomial logit model, a well-justified choice model from the economic literature.
In this model, the revenue obtained from selling an item $i$ at a given time $t$ critically depends
on the assortment $S_t$ offered at that time and is given by the Nash equilibrium of a Bertrand game
among the sellers in $S_t$. This imposes a strong dependence/externality among the offered assortments,
items revenues, and inventory levels. Despite that challenge, we devise a constant competitive
algorithm for the online assortment problem with homogeneous buyers. We also show that the online
assortment problem with heterogeneous buyers does not admit a constant competitive algorithm.
To compensate for that issue, we then consider the assortment problem under an offline setting with
heterogeneous buyers. Under a mild market consistency assumption, we show that the generalized
Bertrand game admits a pure Nash equilibrium over general buyer-seller bipartite graphs. Finally,
we develop an $O(\ln m)$-approximation algorithm for optimal market segmentation of the generalized
Bertrand game which allows the platform to derive higher revenues by partitioning the market into
smaller pools.
