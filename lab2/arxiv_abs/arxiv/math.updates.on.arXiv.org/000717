Markov-modulated fluid queues are popular stochastic processes frequently used for modelling
real-life applications. An important performance measure to evaluate in these applications is
their steady-state behaviour, which is determined by the stationary density. Computing it requires
solving a (nonsymmetric) M-matrix algebraic Riccati equation, and indeed computing the stationary
density is the most important application of this class of equations. Xue, Xu and Li [Numer. Math.,
2012] provided a componentwise first-order perturbation analysis of this equation, proving that
the solution can be computed to high relative accuracy even in the smallest entries, and suggested
several algorithms for computing it. An important step in all proposed algorithms is using so-called
triplet representations, which are special representations for M-matrices that allow for a high-accuracy
variant of Gaussian elimination, the GTH-like algorithm. However, triplet representations for
all the M-matrices needed in the algorithm were not found explicitly. This can lead to an accuracy
loss that prevents the algorithms to converge in the componentwise sense. In this paper, we focus
on the structured doubling algorithm, the most efficient among the proposed methods in Xue et al.,
and build upon their results, providing (i) explicit and cancellation-free expressions for the
needed triplet representations, allowing the algorithm to be performed in a really cancellation-free
fashion; (ii) an algorithm to evaluate the final part of the computation to obtain the stationary
density; and (iii) a componentwise error analysis for the resulting algorithm, the first explicit
one for this class of algorithms. We also present numerical results to illustrate the accuracy advantage
of our method over standard (normwise-accurate) algorithms.
