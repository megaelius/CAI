Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have been recently considered as an energy-efficient
solution for future wireless networks due to their fast and low-power configuration, which has
increased potential in enabling massive connectivity and low-latency communications. Accurate
and low-overhead channel estimation in RIS-based systems is one of the most critical challenges
due to the usually large number of RIS unit elements and their distinctive hardware constraints.
In this paper, we focus on the downlink of a RIS-empowered multi-user Multiple Input Single Output
(MISO) downlink communication systems and propose a channel estimation framework based on the
PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) decomposition to unfold the resulting cascaded channel model. We present
two iterative estimation algorithms for the channels between the base station and RIS, as well as
the channels between RIS and users. One is based on alternating least squares (ALS), while the other
uses vector approximate message passing to iteratively reconstruct two unknown channels from
the estimated vectors. To theoretically assess the performance of the ALS-based algorithm, we
derived its estimation Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB). We also discuss the achievable sum-rate computation
with estimated channels and different precoding schemes for the base station. Our extensive simulation
results show that our algorithms outperform benchmark schemes and that the ALS technique achieve
the CRB. It is also demonstrated that the sum rate using the estimated channels reached that of perfect
channel estimation under various settings, thus, verifying the effectiveness and robustness
of the proposed estimation algorithms.
