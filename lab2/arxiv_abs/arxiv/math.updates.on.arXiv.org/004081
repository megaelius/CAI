Weakly complete real or complex associative algebras $A$ are necessarily projective limits of
finite dimensional algebras. Their group of units $A^{-1}$ is a pro-Lie group with the associated
topological Lie algebra $A_{\rm Lie}$ of $A$ as Lie algebra and the globally defined exponential
function $\exp\colon A\to A^{-1}$ as the exponential function of $A^{-1}$. With each topological
group $G$, a weakly complete group algebra ${\mathbb K}[G]$ is associated functorially so that
the functor $G\mapsto {\mathbb K}[G]$ is left adjoint to $A\mapsto A^{-1}$. The group algebra ${\mathbb
K}[G]$ is a weakly complete Hopf algebra. If $G$ is compact, then ${\mathbb R}[G]$ contains $G$ as
the set of grouplike elements. The category of all real weakly complete Hopf algebras $A$ with a compact
group of grouplike elements whose linear span is dense in $A$ is equivalent to the category of compact
groups. The group algebra $A={\mathbb R}[G]$ of a compact group $G$ contains a copy of the Lie algebra
${\frak L}(G)$ in $A_{\rm Lie}$; it also contains all probability measures on $G$. The dual of the
group algebra ${\mathbb R}[G]$ is the Hopf algebra ${\cal R}(G,{\mathbb R})$ of representative
functions of $G$. The rather straightforward duality between vector spaces and weakly complete
vector spaces thus becomes the basis of a duality ${\cal R}(G,{\mathbb R})\leftrightarrow {\mathbb
R}[G]$ and thus yields a new aspect of Tannaka duality. In the case of a compact abelian $G$, an alternative
concrete construction of ${\mathbb K}[G]$ is given both for $\mathbb K=\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb
K=\mathbb R$. Because of the presence of ${\frak L}(G)$, the enveloping algebras of weakly complete
Lie algebras are introduced and placed into relation with ${\mathbb K}[G]$.
