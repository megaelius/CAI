Borradaile et al. (2017) investigated orientations of an undirected graph in which the sequence
of in-degrees of the nodes is lexicographically minimal, which we call decreasingly minimal (=dec-min).
They proved that an orientation is dec-min if and only if there is no dipath from $s$ to $t$ with in-degrees
$\varrho (t) \geq \varrho (s)+2$. They conjectured that an analogous statement holds for strongly
connected dec-min orientations, as well. We prove not only this conjecture but its extension to
$k$-edge-connected orientations, as well. We also provide a solution to a discrete version of Megiddo's
lexicographically optimal (fractional) network flow problem (1974, 1977). Our main goal is to
integrate these cases into a single framework. Namely, we characterize dec-min elements of an M-convex
set (which is nothing but the set of integral points of an integral base-polyhedron), and prove that
the set of dec-min elements is a special M-convex set arising from a matroid base-polyhedron by translation.
The topic of our investigations may be interpreted as a discrete counter-part of the work by Fujishige
(1980) on the (unique) lexicographically optimal base of a base-polyhedron. We also exhibit a canonical
chain (and partition) associated with a base-polyhedron. We also show that dec-min elements of
an M-convex set are exactly those which minimize the square-sum of components, and describe a new
min-max formula for the minimum square-sum. Our approach gives rise to a strongly polynomial algorithm
for computing a dec-min element, as well as the canonical chain. The algorithm relies on a submodular
function minimizer oracle in the general case, which can, however, be replaced by more efficient
classic flow- and matroid algorithms in the relevant special cases.
