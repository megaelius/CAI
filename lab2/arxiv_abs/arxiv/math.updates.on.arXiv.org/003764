The development of measure theory in 'computational' frame-works like e.g. Reverse Mathematics,
constructive mathematics, and computable analysis, proceeds by studying the computational properties
of countable approximations of measurable objects. At the most basic level, these representations
are provided by Littlewood's three principles, and the associated approximation theorems due
to e.g. Lusin and Egorov. In light of this fundamental role, it is then a natural question how hard
it is to prove the aforementioned theorems (in the sense of the Reverse Mathematics program), and
how hard it is to compute the countable approximations therein (in the sense of Kleene's schemes
S1-S9). The answer to both questions is 'extremely hard', as follows: one one hand, proofs of these
approximation theorems require weak compactness, the measure-theoretical principle underlying
e.g. Vitali's covering theorem. In terms of the usual scale of comprehension axioms, weak compactness
is only provable using full second-order arithmetic. On the other hand, computing the associated
approximations requires the weak fan functional $\Lambda$, which is a realiser for weak compactness,
and is only computable from (a certain comprehension functional for) full second-order arithmetic.
Despite this observed hardness, we show that weak compactness, and certain instances of $\Lambda$,
behave much better than (Heine-Borel) compactness and the associated realiser, called the special
fan functional $\Theta$. In particular, we show that the combination of $\Lambda$ and the Suslin
functional has no more computational power than the latter functional alone, in contrast to $\Theta$.
Finally, our results have significant foundational implications for any approach to measure theory
that makes use of representations.
