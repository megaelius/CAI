Estimating the number of signals is a fundamental problem in many scientific and engineering fields.
As a well-known estimator based on the random matrix theory (RMT), the RMT estimator estimates the
number of signals via detecting the largest noise eigenvalues. Since the RMT estimator does not
consider the interaction among eigenvalues, it tends to down-estimate the number of signals when
there are weak signals. In order to overcome this problem, we propose signal search enhanced RMT
estimators by considering the interaction among the sample eigenvalues. The main contributions
are as follows: (a) We firstly derive a novel decision statistics for signal number estimation by
utilizing the distribution of the sample signal eigenvalues. Then, based on this decision statistics,
a signal search enhanced RMT estimator is proposed to estimate the number of signals via sequentially
testing whether the decision statistics is above a threshold to determine whether an eigenvalue
is from a signal or noise; (b) Secondly, the analysis shows that this signal search enhanced RMT estimator
has better detection performance than the RMT estimator for weak signals, but has larger over-estimation
probability than the RMT estimator for the cases when there is no signal or when all signals are strong
signals. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the signal search enhanced RMT estimator, we further
propose an improved signal search RMT estimator by introducing a penalty term into the decision
statistics of the signal search enhanced RMT estimator.Finally, simulation results show that
the proposed signal search RMT estimators significantly outperform the existing estimators.
