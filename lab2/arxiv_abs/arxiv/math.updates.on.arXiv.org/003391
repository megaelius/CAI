The collective behavior of biological oscillators has been recognized as an important problem
for several decades, but its control has come into limelight only recently. Much of the focus for
control has been on desynchronization of an oscillator population, motivated by the pathological
neural synchrony present in essential and parkinsonian tremor. Other applications, such as the
beating of the heart and insulin secretion, require synchronization, and recently there has been
interest in forming clusters within an oscillator population as well. In this article, we devise
a unified control framework to achieve all of these distinct collective behaviors observed in biological
oscillators. The control algorithm is based on the partial differential equation governing the
evolution of the phase distribution of a population of identical, uncoupled oscillators. Motivated
by pathological neural synchrony, we apply our control to desynchronize an initially synchronized
neural population. Given the proposed importance of enhancing spike time dependent plasticity
to stabilize neural clusters and counteract pathological neural synchronization, we formulate
the phase difference distribution in terms of the phase distribution, and prove some of its fundamental
properties, and in turn apply our control to transform the neural phase distribution to form clusters.
Finally, motivated by eliminating cardiac alternans, we apply our control to phase shift a synchronous
cardiac pacemaker cell population. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our control for each of
these applications, we show that a population of 100 phase oscillators with the applied control
mimics the desired phase distribution.
