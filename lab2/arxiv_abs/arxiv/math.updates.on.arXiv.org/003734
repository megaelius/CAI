Uncertainty quantification techniques based on generalized polynomial chaos have been used in
many application domains. However, almost all existing algorithms and applications have a strong
assumption that the parameters are mutually independent or Gaussian correlated. This assumption
is rarely true in real applications. For instance, in chip manufacturing, many process variations
are caused by the same fabrication steps and thus correlated. Several recent papers have developed
some new techniques to handle process variations with non-Gaussian correlated parameters, but
they are time-consuming for high-dimensional problems. This paper presents a new framework to
solve high-dimensional uncertainty quantification problems with non-Gaussian correlated uncertainties.
Firstly, we propose a class of smooth basis functions that can well capture the impact of non-Gaussian
correlated process variations. We develop a tensor approach to compute these basis functions in
a high-dimension setting. Secondly, we investigate the theoretical aspect and practical implementation
of a sparse solver to compute the coefficients of all basis functions. We provide some theoretical
analysis for the condition and error bound of this sparse solver in the context of uncertainty quantification.
Additionally, we present three approaches for adaptive sampling: D-optimal, R-optimal, and E-optimal
methods, which can improve the performance of the sparse solver significantly. Finally, we validate
our theory and algorithms by a synthetic example and three electronic and photonic ICs with 19 to
57 non-Gaussian correlated variation parameters. Our approach outperforms Monte Carlo by thousands
of times in terms of efficiency on these examples. It can also accurately predict the output density
functions with multiple peaks caused by non-Gaussian correlations, which are hard to capture by
existing methods.
