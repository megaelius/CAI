The system of undetermined coefficients of a bifurcation problem G[z]=0 in Banach spaces is investigated
for proving the existence of families of solution curves by use of the implicit function theorem.
The main theorem represents an Artin-Tougeron type result in the sense that approximation of order
2k ensures exact solutions agreeing up to order k with the approximation [13], [22]. Alternatively,
it may be interpreted as Hensel's Lemma in Banach spaces. In the spirit of [9] and [18], the required
surjectivity condition is interpreted as a direct sum condition of order k that allows for solving
the remainder equation with respect to graded subspaces derived from an appropriate filtration
[24], [25]. In the direction of these subspaces, the determinant can be calculated in a finite dimensional
setting, enabling the investigation of secondary global bifurcation phenomena by sign change
of Brouwer's degree [18]. The direct sum condition seems to be a generalization of the direct sum
condition introduced in [9]. The implicit function theorem delivers stability of k leading coefficients
with respect to perturbations of order 2k+1 and uniqueness in pointed wedges around the solution
curves. Further, a lower bound of the Greenberg function of a singularity is constructed by use of
a step function obtained from k-degrees. Finally, based on Kouchnirenko's theorem [17], the results
are applied to Newton-polygons where it is shown that the Milnor number of a singularity can be calculated
by the sum of k-degrees of corresponding solution curves. Simple ADE-singularities are investigated
in detail. The main theorem represents a version of strong implicit function theorem in Banach spaces,
possibly comparable to theorems in [2]. Moreover, our aim is to extend the direct sum condition of
order k from [9] to certain topics in singularity and approximation theory.
