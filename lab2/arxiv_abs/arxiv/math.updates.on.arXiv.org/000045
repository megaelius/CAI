Random fields play a central role in the analysis of spatially correlated data and, as a result, have
a significant impact on a broad array of scientific applications. Given the importance of this topic,
there has been a substantial amount of research devoted to this area. However, the cepstral random
field model remains largely underdeveloped outside the engineering literature. We provide a comprehensive
treatment of the asymptotic theory for two-dimensional random field models. In particular, we
provide recursive formulas that connect the spatial cepstral coefficients to an equivalent moving-average
random field, which facilitates easy computation of the necessary autocovariance matrix. Additionally,
we establish asymptotic consistency results for Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and quasi-maximum
likelihood estimation of random field parameters and regression parameters. Further, in both
the maximum and quasi-maximum likelihood frameworks, we derive the asymptotic distribution of
our estimator. The theoretical results are presented generally and are of independent interest,
pertaining to a wide class of random field models. The results for the cepstral model facilitate
model-building: because the cepstral coefficients are unconstrained in practice, numerical
optimization is greatly simplified, and we are always guaranteed a positive definite covariance
matrix. We show that inference for individual coefficients is possible, and one can refine models
in a disciplined manner. Finally, our results are illustrated through simulation and the analysis
of straw yield data in an agricultural field experiment.
