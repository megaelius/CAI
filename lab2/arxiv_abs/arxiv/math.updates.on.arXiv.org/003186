In this paper, we investigate physical-layer security for a spectrum-sharing heterogeneous cellular
network comprised of a macro cell and a small cell, where a passive eavesdropper is assumed to tap
the transmissions of both the macro cell and small cell. In the macro cell, a macro base station (MBS)
equipped with multiple distributed antennas sends its confidential information to a macro user
(MU) through an opportunistic transmit antenna. Meanwhile, in the small cell, a small base station
(SBS) transmits to a small user (SU) over the same spectrum used by MBS. We propose an interference-canceled
opportunistic antenna selection (IC-OAS) scheme to enhance physical-layer security for the heterogeneous
network. To be specific, when MBS sends its confidential message to MU through an opportunistic
distributed antenna, a special signal is artificially designed and emitted at MBS to ensure that
the received interference at MU from SBS is canceled out. For comparison, the conventional interference-limited
opportunistic antenna selection (IL-OAS) is considered as a benchmark. We characterize the security-reliability
tradeoff (SRT) for the proposed IC-OAS and conventional IL-OAS schemes in terms of deriving their
closed-form expressions of intercept probability and outage probability. Numerical results
show that compared with the conventional IL-OAS, the proposed IC-OAS scheme not only brings SRT
benefits to the macro cell, but also has the potential of improving the SRT of small cell by increasing
the number of distributed antennas. Additionally, by jointly taking into account the macro cell
and small cell, an overall SRT of the proposed IC-OAS scheme is shown to be significantly better than
that of the conventional IL-OAS approach in terms of a sum intercept probability versus sum outage
probability.
