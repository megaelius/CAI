Space-time and internal symmetries are considered within one theoretical framework based on the
generalized spin and abstract Hilbert space. Complex momentum is understood as a generating kernel
of the underlying spinor structure. It is shown that tensor products of biquaternion algebras are
associated with the each irreducible representation of the Lorentz group. Space-time discrete
symmetries $P$, $T$ and their combination $PT$ are generated by the fundamental automorphisms
of this algebraic background (Clifford algebras). Charge conjugation $C$ is presented by a pseudoautomorphism
of the complex Clifford algebra. This description of the operation $C$ allows one to distinguish
charged and neutral particles including particle-antiparticle interchange and truly neutral
particles. Quotient representations of the Lorentz group and their possible relations with $P$-
and $CP$-violations are considered. Spin and charge multiplets, based on the interlocking representations
of the Lorentz group, are introduced. A central point of the work is a correspondence between Wigner
definition of elementary particle as an irreducible representation of the Poincar\'{e} group
and $SU(3)$-description (quark scheme) of the particle as a vector of the supermultiplet (irreducible
representation of $SU(3)$). This correspondence is realized on the ground of a spin-charge Hilbert
space. Basic hadron supermultiplets of $SU(3)$-theory (baryon octet and two meson octets) are
studied in this framework. It is shown that quark phenomenologies are naturally incorporated into
presented scheme. The relationship between mass and spin allows one to take a new look at the problem
of mass spectrum of elementary particles.
