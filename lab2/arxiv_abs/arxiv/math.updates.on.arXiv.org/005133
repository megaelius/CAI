The present work develops hybrid multigrid methods for high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations
of elliptic problems. Fast matrix-free operator evaluation on tensor product elements is used
to devise a computationally efficient PDE solver. The multigrid hierarchy exploits all possibilities
of geometric, polynomial, and algebraic coarsening, targeting engineering applications on complex
geometries. Additionally, a transfer from discontinuous to continuous function spaces is performed
within the multigrid hierarchy. This does not only further reduce the problem size of the coarse-grid
problem, but also leads to a discretization most suitable for state-of-the-art algebraic multigrid
methods applied as coarse-grid solver. The relevant design choices regarding the selection of
optimal multigrid coarsening strategies among the various possibilities are discussed with the
metric of computational costs as the driving force for algorithmic selections. We find that a transfer
to a continuous function space at highest polynomial degree (or on the finest mesh), followed by
polynomial and geometric coarsening, shows the best overall performance. The success of this particular
multigrid strategy is due to a significant reduction in iteration counts as compared to a transfer
from discontinuous to continuous function spaces at lowest polynomial degree (or on the coarsest
mesh). The coarsening strategy with transfer to a continuous function space on the finest level
leads to a multigrid algorithm that is robust with respect to the penalty parameter of the SIPG method.
Detailed numerical investigations are conducted for a series of examples ranging from academic
test cases to more complex, practically relevant geometries. Performance comparisons to state-of-the-art
methods from the literature demonstrate the versatility and computational efficiency of the proposed
multigrid algorithms.
