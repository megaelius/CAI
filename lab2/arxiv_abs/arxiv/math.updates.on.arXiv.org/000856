Feldman et al. (2005) asked whether the performance of the Linear Programming (LP) decoder can be
improved by adding redundant parity checks to tighten the LP relaxation. We prove in this paper that
for LDPC codes, even if we include all redundant parity checks, asymptotically there is no gain in
the LP decoder threshold on the BSC under certain conditions on the base Tanner graph. First, we show
that if the Tanner graph has bounded check-degree and satisfies a condition which we call asymptotic
strength, then including high degree redundant parity checks in the LP does not significantly improve
the threshold of the LP decoder in the following sense: for each constant delta>0, there is a constant
k>0 such that the threshold of the LP decoder containing all redundant checks of degree at most
k improves by at most delta upon adding to the LP all redundant checks of degree larger than k. We conclude
that if the graph satisfies an additional condition which we call rigidity, then including all redundant
checks does not improve the threshold of the base LP. We call the graph asymptotically strong if the
LP decoder corrects a constant fraction of errors even if the log-likelihood-ratios of the correct
variables are arbitrarily small. By building on a construction due Feldman et al. (2007) and its
recent improvement by Viderman (2013), we show that asymptotic strength follows from sufficiently
large variable-to-check expansion. We also give a geometric interpretation of asymptotic strength
in terms pseudocodewords. We call the graph rigid if the minimum weight of a redundant check obtained
by a nonacyclic sum of check nodes tends to infinity as the block length tends to infinity. We argue
that under the assumption that the graph girth is logarithmic, rigidity is equivalent to a nondegeneracy
property, which holds with high probability for random check-regular graphs.
