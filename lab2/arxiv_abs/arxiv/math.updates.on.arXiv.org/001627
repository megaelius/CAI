In this paper we study a wide and flexible family of discrete distributions, the so-called GG-mixed
Poisson distributions that are mixed Poisson distributions in which the mixing laws belong to the
class of generalized gamma distributions (GG-distributions). The latter was introduced by E.
W. Stacy as a special family of lifetime distributions containing gamma, exponential power and
Weibull distributions. These distributions seem to be very promising in the statistical description
of many real phenomena being very convenient and almost universal models for the description of
statistical regularities in discrete data. Analytic properties of GG-mixed Poisson distributions
are studied. A GG-distribution is proved to be a mixed exponential distribution if and only if the
shape and exponent power parameters are no greater than one. The mixing distribution is written
out explicitly as a scale mixture of strictly stable laws concentrated on the nonnegative halfline.
As a corollary, the representation is obtained for the GG-mixed Poisson distribution as a mixed
geometric distribution. The corresponding scheme of Bernoulli trials with random probability
of success is considered. Within this scheme, a random analog of the Poisson theorem is proved establishing
the convergence of mixed binomial distributions to mixed Poisson laws. Limit theorems are proved
for random sums of independent random variables in which the number of summands has the GG-mixed
Poisson distribution and the summands have both light- and heavy-tailed distributions. The class
of limit laws is wide enough and includes the so-called generalized variance gamma distributions.
Various representations for the limit laws are obtained in terms of mixtures of Mittag-Leffler,
Linnik or Laplace distributions.
