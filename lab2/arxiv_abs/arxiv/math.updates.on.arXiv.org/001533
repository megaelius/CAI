I provide an explicit construction of spectral curves for the affine $\mathrm{E}_8$ relativistic
Toda chain. Their closed form expression is obtained by determining the full set of character relations
in the representation ring of $\mathrm{E}_8$ for the exterior algebra of the adjoint representation;
this is in turn employed to provide an explicit construction of both integrals of motion and the action-angle
map for the resulting integrable system. I consider two main areas of applications of these constructions.
On the one hand, I consider the resulting family of spectral curves in the context of the correspondences
between Toda systems, 5d Seiberg-Witten theory, Gromov-Witten theory of orbifolds of the resolved
conifold, and Chern-Simons theory to establish a version of the B-model Gopakumar-Vafa correspondence
for the $\mathrm{sl}_N$ L\^e-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant of the Poincar\'e integral homology
sphere to all orders in $1/N$. On the other, I consider a degenerate version of the spectral curves
and prove a 1-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg mirror theorem for the Frobenius manifold structure
on the space of orbits of the extended affine Weyl group of type $\mathrm{E}_8$ introduced by Dubrovin-Zhang
(equivalently, the orbifold quantum cohomology of the type-$\mathrm{E}_8$ polynomial $\mathbb{C}
P^1$ orbifold). This leads to closed-form expressions for the flat co-ordinates of the Saito metric,
the prepotential, and a higher genus mirror theorem based on the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin recursion.
I will also show how the constructions of the paper lead to a generalisation of a conjecture of Norbury-Scott
to ADE $\mathbb{P}^1$-orbifolds, and a mirror of the Dubrovin-Zhang construction for all Weyl
groups and choices of marked roots.
