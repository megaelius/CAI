In this paper, we consider the inverse problem of determining an unknown function defined in three
space dimensions from its geodesic X-ray transform. The standard X-ray transform is defined on
the Euclidean metric and is given by the integration of a function along straight lines. The geodesic
X-ray transform is the generalization of the standard X-ray transform in Riemannian manifolds
and is defined by integration of a function along geodesics. This paper is motivated by Uhlmann and
Vasy's theoretical reconstruction algorithm for geodesic X-ray transform and mathematical formulation
for traveltime tomography to develop a novel numerical algorithm for the stated goal. Our numerical
scheme is based on a Neumann series approximation and a layer stripping approach. In particular,
we will first reconstruct the unknown function by using a convergent Neumann series for each small
neighborhood near the boundary. Once the solution is constructed on a layer near the boundary, we
repeat the same procedure for the next layer, and continue this process until the unknown function
is recovered on the whole domain. One main advantage of our approach is that the reconstruction is
localized, and is therefore very efficient, compared with other global approaches for which the
reconstructions are performed on the whole domain. We illustrate the performance of our method
by showing some test cases including the Marmousi model. Finally, we apply this method to a travel
time tomography in 3D, in which the inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform is one important step,
and present several numerical results to validate the scheme.
