We study the symmetric subquotient decomposition of the associated graded algebras $A^*$ of a non-homogeneous
commutative Artinian Gorenstein (AG) algebra $A$. This decomposition arises from the stratification
of $A^*$ by a sequence of ideals $A^*=C_A(0)\supset C_A(1)\supset\cdots$ whose successive quotients
$Q(a)=C(a)/C(a+1)$ are reflexive $A^*$ modules. These were introduced by the first author, and
have been used more recently by several groups, especially those interested in short Gorenstein
algebras, and in the scheme length (cactus rank) of forms. For us a Gorenstein sequence is an integer
sequence $H$ occurring as the Hilbert function for an AG algebra $A$, that is not necessarily homogeneous.
Such a Hilbert function $H(A)$ is the sum of symmetric non-negative sequences $H_A(a)=H(Q_A(a))$,
each having center of symmetry $(j-a)/2$ where $j$ is the socle degree of $A$: we call these the symmetry
conditions, and the decomposition $\mathcal{D}(A)=(H_A(0),H_A(1),\ldots)$ the symmetric
decomposition of $H(A)$. We here study which sequences may occur as the summands $H_A(a)$: in particular
we construct in a systematic way examples of AG algebras $A$ for which $H_A(a)$ can have interior
zeroes, as $H_A(a)=(0,s,0,\ldots,0,s,0)$. We also study the symmetric decomposition sets $\mathcal{D}(A)$,
and in particular determine which sequences $H_A(a)$ can be non-zero when the dual generator is
linear in a subset of the variables. Several groups have studied "exotic summands" of the Macaulay
dual generator $F$. Studying these, we recall a normal form for the Macaulay dual generator of an
AG algebra that has no "exotic" summands. We apply this to Gorenstein algebras that are connected
sums. We give throughout many examples and counterexamples, and conclude with some open questions
about symmetric decomposition.
