Despite the success of demand response programs in retail electricity markets in reducing average
consumption, the random responsiveness of consumers to price event makes their efficiency questionable
to achieve the flexibility needed for electric systems with a large share of renewable energy. The
variance of consumers' responses depreciates the value of these mechanisms and makes them weakly
reliable. This paper aims at designing demand response contracts which allow to act on both the average
consumption and its variance. The interaction between a risk--averse producer and a risk--averse
consumer is modelled through a Principal--Agent problem, thus accounting for the moral hazard
underlying demand response contracts. We provide closed--form solution for the optimal contract
in the case of constant marginal costs of energy and volatility for the producer and constant marginal
value of energy for the consumer. We show that the optimal contract has a rebate form where the initial
condition of the consumption serves as a baseline. Further, the consumer cannot manipulate the
baseline at his own advantage. The second--best price for energy and volatility are non--constant
and non--increasing in time. The price for energy is lower (resp. higher) than the marginal cost
of energy during peak--load (resp. off--peak) periods. We illustrate the potential benefit issued
from the implementation of an incentive mechanism on the responsiveness of the consumer by calibrating
our model with publicly available data. We predict a significant increase of responsiveness under
our optimal contract and a significant increase of the producer satisfaction.
