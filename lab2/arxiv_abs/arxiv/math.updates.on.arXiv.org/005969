We effectively answer the geometric Shafarevich's conjecture on the squarefree odd hyperelliptic
curves with a marked Weierstrass point as a consequence of acquiring a family of new sharp asymptotic
with the leading term of order $\mathcal{O}\left( \mathcal{B}^{\frac{2g+3}{4g+2}} \right)$
on $\mathcal{Z}_{g, \mathbb{F}_q(t)}(\mathcal{B})$ for counting the quasi-admissible hyperelliptic
curves by the bounded height of the hyperelliptic discriminant $\Delta_{g}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$
with $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) > 2g+1$ . The precise counts are acquired by considering the
Hom stack $\mathrm{Hom}_n(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathcal{P}(\vec{\lambda}))$ of degree $n$ rational
curves on $\mathcal{P}(\vec{\lambda})$, the $N$-dimensional $\vec{\lambda} = (\lambda_0,
\dotsc, \lambda_N)$ weighted projective stack. Considering arithmetic of the moduli of semistable
fibered algebraic surfaces over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, we establish an injective transformation
from the moduli $Q_g$ of quasi-stable (which includes the semistable) hyperelliptic fibrations
with a marked Weierstrass section to the moduli $\mathcal{L}_{g}$ of quasi-admissible hyperelliptic
fibrations over any basefield $K$ with $\mathrm{char}(K) = 0$ or $\mathrm{char}(K) > 2g+1$. Consequently,
we acquire the motive of the moduli stack of quasi-admissible hyperelliptic fibrations with $|\Delta_{g}|
= 4g(2g+1)n$ as $$\left[\mathcal{L}_{g, |\Delta_g|}\right] = \mathbb{L}^{2g(2g+3)n} \cdot
(\mathbb{L}^{2g-1} + \mathbb{L}^{2g-2} + \dotsb + \mathbb{L}^2 + \mathbb{L}^1 -\mathbb{L}^{-1}-\mathbb{L}^{-2}-
\dotsb - \mathbb{L}^{-2g+2} - \mathbb{L}^{-2g+1})$$ In the end, we formulate a family of analogous
heuristic on $\mathcal{Z}_{g, \mathbb{Q}}(\mathcal{B})$ for counting the odd degree hyperelliptic
genus $g$ curves with a marked rational Weierstrass point over $\mathbb{Q}$ by the bounded height
of $\Delta_{g}$ through the global fields analogy.
