The efficient generation of meshes is an important step in the numerical solution of various problems
in physics and engineering. We are interested in situations where global mesh quality and tight
coupling to the physical solution is important. We consider elliptic PDE based mesh generation
and present a method for the construction of adaptive meshes in two spatial dimensions using domain
decomposition that is suitable for an implementation on parallel computing architectures. The
method uses the stochastic representation of the exact solution of a linear mesh generator of Winslow
type to find the points of the adaptive mesh along the subdomain interfaces. The meshes over the single
subdomains can then be obtained completely independently of each other using the probabilistically
computed solutions along the interfaces as boundary conditions for the linear mesh generator.
Further to the previously acknowledged performance characteristics, we demonstrate how the stochastic
domain decomposition approach is particularly suited to the problem of grid generation - generating
quality meshes efficiently. In addition we show further improvements are possible using interpolation
of the subdomain interfaces and smoothing of mesh candidates. An optimal placement strategy is
introduced to automatically choose the number and placement of points along the interface using
the mesh density function. Various examples of meshes constructed using this stochastic-deterministic
domain decomposition technique are shown and compared to the respective single domain solutions
using a representative mesh quality measure. A brief performance study is included to show the viability
of the stochastic domain decomposition approach and to illustrate the effect of algorithmic choices
on the solver's efficiency.
