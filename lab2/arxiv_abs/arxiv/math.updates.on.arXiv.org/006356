The book is devoted to the strong approximation of iterated stochastic integrals (ISIs) in the context
of numerical integration of Ito SDEs and non-commutative semilinear SPDEs with nonlinear multiplicative
trace class noise. The presented monograph open a new direction in researching of ISIs. For the first
time we successfully use the generalized multiple Fourier series (Fourier-Legendre series as
well as trigonometric Fourier series) converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$
for the expansion and strong approximation of Ito ISIs of multiplicity $k,$ $k\in{\bf N}$ (Chapter
1). This result is adapted for Stratonovich ISIs of multiplicities 1 to 5 (Chapter 2) as well as for
some other types of ISIs (Chapter 1). Two theorems on expansions of Stratonovich ISIs of multiplicity
$k$ ($k\in{\bf N}$) based on generalized iterated Fourier series (converging pointwise) are formulated
and proved (Chapter 2). The integration order replacement technique for the class of Ito ISIs has
been introduced (Chapter 3). This result is generalized for the class of ISIs with respect to martingales.
We derived the exact and approximate expressions for the mean-square error of approximation of
Ito ISIs of multiplicity $k$, $k\in{\bf N}$ (Chapter 1). Furthermore, we provided a significant
practical material (Chapter 5) devoted to the expansions and approximations of specific Ito and
Stratonovich ISIs of multiplicities 1 to 6 from the Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich expansions
(Chapter 4) using the system of Legendre polynomials and the system of trigonometric functions.
The methods formulated in this book have been compared with some existing methods (Chapter 6). The
results of Chapter 1 were applied (Chapter 7) to the approximation of Ito ISIs of multiplicity $k,$
$k\in{\bf N}$ with respect to the $Q$-Wiener process.
