We study $L^p$-$L^q$ estimate for the spectral projection operator $\Pi_\lambda$ associated
to the Hermite operator $H=|x|^2-\Delta$ in $\mathbb R^d$ where $\Pi_\lambda$ is the projection
to the subspace spanned by the Hermite functions which are the eigenfunctions of $H$ with the eigenvalue
$\lambda$. Such estimates were previously available only for $q=p'$, equivalently $p=2$ or $q=2$
(by $TT^*$ argument) except for the estimates which are consequences of interpolation between
those estimates. As shown in the works of Karadzhov, Thangavelu, and Koch and Tataru, the local and
global estimates are of different nature. Especially, $\Pi_\lambda$ exhibits complicated behavior
near the set $\sqrt\lambda\mathbb S^{d-1}$. Compared with the spectral projection operator associated
with the Laplacian, the $L^p$-$L^q$ boundedness of $\Pi_\lambda$ is not so well understood up to
now for general $p,q$. In this paper we consider the $L^p$-$L^q$ estimate for $\Pi_\lambda$ in a
general framework including the local and global estimates with $1\le p\le 2\le q\le \infty$ and
undertake the work of characterizing the sharp bounds on $\Pi_\lambda$. We establish various new
sharp estimates in an extended range of $p,q$. First of all, we provide a complete characterization
of the local estimate for $\Pi_\lambda$ which was first considered by Thangavelu. Secondly, for
$d\ge5$, we prove the endpoint $L^2$-$L^{2(d+3)/(d+1)}$ estimate for $\Pi_\lambda$ which has
been left open since the work of Koch and Tataru. Thirdly, we extend the range of $p,q$ for which the
operator $\Pi_\lambda$ is uniformly bounded from $L^p$ to $L^q$. As an application, we obtain new
$L^p$-$L^q$ resolvent estimates for the Hermite operator $H$ and Carleman estimates for the heat
operator. This allows us to prove the strong unique continuation property of the heat operator for
the potentials contained in $L^\infty_tL^{d/2,\infty}_x$.
