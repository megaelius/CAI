This work focuses on the accuracy and stability of high-order nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
methods for under-resolved turbulence computations. In particular we consider the inviscid Taylor-Green
vortex (TGV) flow to analyse the implicit large eddy simulation (iLES) capabilities of DG methods
at very high Reynolds numbers. The governing equations are discretised in two ways in order to suppress
aliasing errors introduced into the discrete variational forms due to the under-integration of
non-linear terms. The first, more straightforward way relies on consistent/over-integration,
where quadrature accuracy is improved by using a larger number of integration points, consistent
with the degree of the non-linearities. The second strategy, originally applied in the high-order
finite difference community, relies on a split (or skew-symmetric) form of the governing equations.
Different split forms are available depending on how the variables in the non-linear terms are grouped.
The desired split form is then built by averaging conservative and non-conservative forms of the
governing equations, although conservativity of the DG scheme is fully preserved. A preliminary
analysis based on Burgers' turbulence in one spatial dimension is conducted and shows the potential
of split forms in keeping the energy of higher-order polynomial modes close to the expected levels.
This indicates that the favourable dealiasing properties observed from split-form approaches
in more classical schemes seem to hold for DG. The remainder of the study considers a comprehensive
set of (under-resolved) computations of the inviscid TGV flow and compares the accuracy and robustness
of consistent/over-integration and split form discretisations based on the local Lax-Friedrichs
and Roe-type Riemann solvers...
