We discuss, study, and compare experimentally three methods for solving the system of algebraic
equations $\mathbb{A}^\alpha \bf{u}=\bf{f}$, $0< \alpha <1$, where $\mathbb{A}$ is a symmetric
and positive definite matrix obtained from finite difference or finite element approximations
of second order elliptic problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=1,2,3$. The first method, introduced
by Harizanov et.al, based on the best uniform rational approximation (BURA) $r_\alpha(t)$ of $t^{1-\alpha}$
for $0 \le t \le 1$, is used to get the rational approximation of $t^{-\alpha}$ in the form $t^{-1}r_\alpha(t)$.
Here we develop another method, denoted by R-BURA, that is based on the best rational approximation
$r_{1-\alpha}(t)$ of $t^\alpha$ on the interval $[0,1]$ and approximates $t^{-\alpha}$ via $r^{-1}_{1-\alpha}(t)$.
The third method, introduced and studied by Bonito and Pasciak, is based on an exponentially convergent
quadrature scheme for the Dundord-Taylor integral representation of the fractional powers of
elliptic operators. All three methods reduce the solution of the system $\mathbb{A}^\alpha \bf{u}=\bf{f}$
to solving a number of equations of the type $(\mathbb{A} +c\mathbb{I})\bf{u}= \bf{f}$, $c \ge
0$. Comprehensive numerical experiments on model problems with $\mathbb A$ obtained by approximation
of elliptic equations in one and two spatial dimensions are used to compare the efficiency of these
three algorithms depending on the fractional power $\alpha$. The presented results prove the concept
of the new R-BURA method, which performs well for $\alpha$ close to $1$ in contrast to BURA, which
performs well for $\alpha $ close to $0$. As a result, we show theoretically and experimentally,
that they have mutually complementary advantages.
