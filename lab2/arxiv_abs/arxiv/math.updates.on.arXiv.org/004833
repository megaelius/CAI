A Sturmian sequence is an infinite string over two letters with low subword complexity. The history
of the research surveyed in the present chapter starts with two papers written by Morse and Hedlund
as well as Coven and Hedlund in 1940 and 1973, respectively. In these papers the authors established
a surprising correspondence between Sturmian sequences and rotations by an irrational number
on the unit circle. Later, Arnoux and Rauzy observed that an induction process in which the classical
continued fraction algorithm appears can be used to give another very elegant proof of this correspondence.
It has been conjectured since the early 1990ies that these correspondences between rotations on
the unit circle, continued fractions, and Sturmian sequences carry over to rotations on higher
dimensional tori, generalized continued fraction algorithms, and so-called $S$-adic sequences
generated by substitutions. The idea of working towards such a generalization is known as Rauzy's
program. Recently Berth\'e, Steiner, and Thuswaldner made some progress on Rauzy's program and
were indeed able to set up the conjectured generalization of the above correspondences. Using a
generalization of Rauzy's induction process in which generalized continued fraction algorithms
show up, they proved that under certain natural conditions an $S$-adic sequence gives rise to a dynamical
system which is measurably conjugate to a rotation on a higher dimensional torus. Moreover, they
established a metric theory which shows that exceptional cases like the ones constructed in 2000
and 2006 by Cassaigne and his coauthors are rare. It is the aim of the present paper to survey all these
ideas and results.
