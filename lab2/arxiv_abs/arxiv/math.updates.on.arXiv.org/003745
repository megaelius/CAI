Let $E$ be a sufficiently large finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\rho_p$ be a semi-stable
representation $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}/\mathbb{Q}_p)\rightarrow\mathrm{GL}_3(E)$
with a rank two monodromy operator $N$ and a non-critical Hodge filtration. We know that $\rho_p$
has three $\mathscr{L}$-invariants. We construct a family of locally analytic representations
of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ depending on three invariants in $E$ with each of them containing
the locally algebraic representation determined by $\rho_p$. When $\rho_p$ comes from an automorphic
representation $\pi$ of $G(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}_p})$ for a suitable unitary group $G_{/\mathbb{Q}}$,
we show that there is a unique object in the above family that embeds into the associated Hecke-isotypic
subspace in the completed cohomology. We recall that Breuil constructed a family of locally analytic
representations depending on four invariants and proved a similar result of local-global compatibility.
We prove that if a representation $\Pi$ in Breuil's family embeds into the completed cohomology,
then it must equally embed into an object in our family determined by $\Pi$. This gives a purely representation
theoretic necessary condition for $\Pi$ to embed into completed cohomology. Moreover, certain
natural subquotients of each object in our family give a true complex of locally analytic representations
that realizes the derived object $\Sigma(\lambda, \underline{\mathscr{L}})$ by Schraen for
a unique $\underline{\mathscr{L}}$ determined by the object. Consequently, the family we construct
gives a relation between the higher $\mathscr{L}$-invariants studied by Breuil and Ding and the
$p$-adic dilogarithm function which appears in the construction of $\Sigma(\lambda, \underline{\mathscr{L}})$
by Schraen.
