We study how the torsion of elliptic curves over number fields grows upon base change, and in particular
prove various necessary conditions for torsion growth. For a number field $F$, we show that for a
large set of number fields $L$, whose Galois group of their normal closure over $F$ has certain properties,
it will hold that $E(L)_{tors}=E(F)_{tors}$ for all elliptic curves $E$ defined over $F$. Our methods
turn out to be particularly useful in studying the possible torsion groups $E(K)_{tors}$, where
$K$ is a number field and $E$ is a base change of an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb Q$. Suppose
that $E$ is a base change of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb Q$ for the remainder of the abstract. In
this setting, we prove that $E(K)_{tors}=E(\mathbb Q)_{tors}$ for all elliptic curves $E$ defined
over $\mathbb Q$ and all number fields $K$ of degree $d$, where $d$ is not divisible by a prime $\leq
7$. Using this fact, we determine all the possible torsion groups $E(K)_{tors}$ over number fields
$K$ of prime degree $p\geq 7$. We determine all the possible degrees of $[\mathbb Q(P):\mathbb Q]$,
where $P$ is a point of prime order $p$ for all $p$ such that $p\not\equiv 8 \pmod 9$ or $\left( \frac{-D}{p}\right)=1$
for any $D\in \{1,2,7,11,19,43,67,163\}$; this is true for a set of density $\frac{1535}{1536}$
of all primes and in particular for all $p<3167$. Using this result, we determine all the possible
prime orders of a point $P\in E(K)_{tors}$, where $[K:\mathbb Q]=d$, for all $d\leq 3342296$. Finally,
we solve the outstanding problem of determining all the possible groups $E(K)_{tors}$, where $K$
is a quartic number field and $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb Q$.
