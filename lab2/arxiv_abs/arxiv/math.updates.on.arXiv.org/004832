Classification is at the heart of the scientific enterprise, from bacteria in biology to groups
in mathematics. A central classification project in mathematical logic is motivated by Goedel's
incompleteness theorems. Indeed, logical systems are classified according to how hard it is to
establish that no contradiction can be derived in these systems, yielding the Goedel hierarchy:
a linear hierarchy claimed to encompass all natural/foundationally important systems. The medium
range of this hierarchy is based on second-order arithmetic, a system with roots in Hilbert-Bernays'
Grundlagen der Mathematik. The Goedel hierarchy exhibits remarkable robustness: enriching the
language of the medium range to that of higher-order arithmetic does not change the picture, while
switching to the inclusion ordering introduces only a few natural outliers, and also a parallel
hierarchy for the medium range based on the axiom of determinacy from set theory. In this paper, we
introduce numerous such parallel hierarchies for the inclusion-based and higher-order Goedel
hierarchy, based on basic convergence theorems for nets. Among these higher-order hierarchies,
we identify the Plato hierarchy which yields the (medium range of) the Goedel hierarchy under the
canonical embedding of higher-order into second-order arithmetic. The Plato hierarchy can be
defined in Hilbert-Bernays' Grundlagen, while the erstwhile embedding preserves equivalences,
translating e.g. an equivalence involving the monotone convergence theorem for nets to the well-known
equivalence of arithmetical comprehension and the monotone convergence theorem for sequences.
