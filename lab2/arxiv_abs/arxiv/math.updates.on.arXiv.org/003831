We study the topology generated by the temperature fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) radiation, as quantified by the number of components and holes, formally given by the Betti
numbers, in the growing excursion sets. We compare CMB maps observed by the Planck satellite with
a thousand simulated maps generated according to the LCDM paradigm with Gaussian distributed fluctuations.
The survey of the CMB over $\mathbb{S}^2$ is incomplete due to obfuscation effects by bright point
sources and other extended foreground objects like our own galaxy. To deal with such situations,
where analysis in the presence of "masks" is of importance, we introduce the concept of relative
homology. The parametric $\chi^2$-test shows differences between observations and simulations,
yielding $p$-values at per-cent to less than per-mil levels roughly between 2 to 7 degrees. The highest
observed deviation for $b_0$ and $b_1$ is approximately between $3\sigma$-4$\sigma$ at scales
of 3 to 7 degrees. There are reports of mildly unusual behaviour of the Euler characteristic at 3.66
degrees in the literature, computed from independent measurements of the CMB temperature fluctuations
by Planck's predecessor WMAP satellite. The mildly anomalous behaviour of Euler characteristic
is related to the strongly anomalous behaviour of components and holes. These are also the scales
at which the observed maps exhibit low variance compared to the simulations. Non-parametric tests
show even stronger differences at almost all scales. Regardless, beyond the trivial possibility
that this may still be a manifestation of an extreme Gaussian case, these observations, along with
the super-horizon scales involved, may motivate to look at primordial non-Gaussianity. Alternative
scenarios worth exploring may be models with non-trivial topology.
