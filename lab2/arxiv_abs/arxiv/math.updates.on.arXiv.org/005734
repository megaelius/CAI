For two graphs $G$ and $H$, write $G \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} H$ if $G$ has the
property that every {\sl proper} colouring of its edges admits a {\sl rainbow} copy of $H$. We study
the thresholds for such so called {\sl anti-Ramsey} properties in randomly perturbed dense graphs,
by which we mean unions of the form $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p)$, where $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with
edge-density $d$, the latter being independent of $n$. For complete graphs, we determine the threshold
for the property $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p) \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} K_{2r-1}$
for all $r\geq 2$. In particular, if $r \geq 5$, then this threshold is $n^{-1/m_2(K_r)}$. For complete
graphs of even order, we prove that the property $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p) \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow}
K_{2r}$ holds a.a.s. whenever $r \geq 4$ and $p := p(n) = \omega \left(n^{-(r-2)/\binom{r}{2}}
\right)$. We conjecture, that for every $r \geq 5$, the threshold for the property $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p)
\stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} K_{2r}$ is $n^{-1/m_2(K_r)}$ (the latter is easily
seen to be a lower bound for this threshold). We believe that $n^{-1/m_2(K_r)}$ is not the threshold
for the property $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p) \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} K_{2r}$
whenever $r \leq 4$. Clearly, no random edges are needed for $r=1$. For $r=2$, we prove that the threshold
is $n^{-5/4}$. Lastly, we prove that for every $\ell \geq 1$, the threshold of the property $G \cup
\mathbb{G}(n,p) \stackrel{\mathrm{rbw}}{\longrightarrow} C_{2\ell+1}$ is $n^{-2}$; in particular,
it does not depend on the length of the cycle (clearly, for even cycles, no random perturbation is
needed).
