Given a free-by-cyclie group G = F_N \rtimes_\phi \Z determined by any outer automorphism \phi \in
\Out(F_N) which is represented by an expanding irreducible train-track map, with u_0: G \to \Z the
homomorphism having \ker(u_0) = F_N, we construct a K(G,1) 2-complex X called the "folded mapping
torus" of \phi, and equip it with a semiflow. We show that X enjoys many similar properties to those
proven by Thurston and Fried for the mapping torus of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. In particular,
we construct an open, convex cone \A \subset H^1(X;\R) = \Hom(G;\R) containing u_0, a homology class
\epsilon \in H_1(X;\R), and a continuous, convex, homogeneous of degree -1 function \mathfrak{H}:\A
\to \R with the following properties. Given any primitive integral class u \in \A there is a graph
\Theta_u \subset X such that: (1) the inclusion \Theta_u \to X is \pi_1-injective and \pi_1(\Theta_u)
= \ker(u), (2) u(\epsilon) = \chi(\Theta_u), (3) \Theta_u \subset X is a section of the semiflow
and the first return map to \Theta_u is an expanding irreducible train track map representing \phi_u
\in \Out(\ker(u)) such that G = \ker(u) \rtimes_{\phi_u} \Z, (4) the logarithm of the stretch factor
of \phi_u is precisely \mathfrak{H}(u), (5) if \phi was further assumed to be hyperbolic and fully
irreducible then for every primitive integral u \in \A the automorphism \phi_u of \ker(u) is also
hyperbolic and fully irreducible. In addition, we describe connections with the work of Button,
Dunfield, and McMullen on the Alexander norm, work of Algom-Kfir and Rafi on stretch factors, as
well as work of Gautero and Wang on sections of semiflows.
