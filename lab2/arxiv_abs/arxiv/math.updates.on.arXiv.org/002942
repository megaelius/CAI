In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled interference channel (UAV-IC),
where each of the $K$ UAVs communicates with its associated ground terminals (GTs) at the same time
and over the same spectrum. To exploit the new degree of freedom of UAV mobility for interference
coordination between the UAV-GT links, we formulate a joint trajectory and power control (TPC)
problem for maximizing the aggregate sum rate of the UAV-IC for a given flight interval, under the
practical constraints on the UAV flying speed, altitude, as well as collision avoidance. These
constraints couple the TPC variables across different time slots and UAVs, leading to a challenging
large-scale and non-convex optimization problem. By exploiting the problem structure, we show
that the optimal TPC solution follows the fly-hover-fly strategy, based on which the problem can
be handled by firstly finding an optimal hovering locations followed by solving a dimension-reduced
TPC problem with given initial and hovering locations of UAVs. For the reduced TPC problem, we propose
a successive convex approximation algorithm. To improve the computational efficiency, we further
develop a parallel TPC algorithm that is effciently implementable over multi-core CPUs. We also
propose a {segment-by-segment method} %virtual waypoint model which decomposes the TPC problem
into sequential TPC subproblems each with a smaller problem dimension. Simulation results demonstrate
the superior computation time efficiency of the proposed algorithms, and also show that the UAV-IC
can yield higher network sum rate than the benchmark orthogonal schemes.
