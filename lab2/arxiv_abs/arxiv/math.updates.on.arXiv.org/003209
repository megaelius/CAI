Edge (or N\'ed\'elec) finite elements are theoretically sound and widely used by the computational
electromagnetics community. However, its implementation, specially for high order methods,
is not trivial, since it involves many technicalities that are not properly described in the literature.
To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive description of a general implementation of edge elements
of first kind within the scientific software project FEMPAR. We cover into detail how to implement
arbitrary order (i.e., $p$-adaptive) elements on hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes. First, we
set the three classical ingredients of the finite element definition by Ciarlet, both in the reference
and the physical space: cell topologies, polynomial spaces and moments. With these ingredients,
shape functions are automatically implemented by defining a judiciously chosen polynomial pre-basis
that spans the local finite element space combined with a change of basis to automatically obtain
a canonical basis with respect to the moments at hand. Next, we discuss global finite element spaces
putting emphasis on the construction of global shape functions through oriented meshes, appropriate
geometrical mappings, and equivalence classes of moments, in order to preserve the inter-element
continuity of tangential components of the magnetic field. Finally, we extend the proposed methodology
to generate global curl-conforming spaces on non-conforming hierarchically refined (i.e., $h$-adaptive)
meshes with arbitrary order finite elements. Numerical results include experimental convergence
rates to test the proposed implementation.
