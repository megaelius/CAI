In this paper, we develop a numerical scheme for the space-time fractional parabolic equation,
i.e., an equation involving a fractional time derivative and a fractional spatial operator. Both
the initial value problem and the non-homogeneous forcing problem (with zero initial data) are
considered. The solution operator $E(t)$ for the initial value problem can be written as a Dunford-Taylor
integral involving the Mittag-Leffler function $e_{\alpha,1}$ and the resolvent of the underlying
(non-fractional) spatial operator over an appropriate integration path in the complex plane.
Here $\alpha$ denotes the order of the fractional time derivative. The solution for the non-homogeneous
problem can be written as a convolution involving an operator $W(t)$ and the forcing function $F(t)$.
We develop and analyze semi-discrete methods based on finite element approximation to the underlying
(non-fractional) spatial operator in terms of analogous Dunford-Taylor integrals applied to
the discrete operator. The space error is of optimal order up to a logarithm of $1/h$. The fully discrete
method for the initial value problem is developed from the semi-discrete approximation by applying
an exponentially convergent sinc quadrature technique to approximate the Dunford-Taylor integral
of the discrete operator and is free of any time stepping. To approximate the convolution appearing
in the semi-discrete approximation to the non-homogeneous problem, we apply a pseudo midpoint
quadrature. This involves the average of $W_h(s)$, (the semi-discrete approximation to $W(s)$)
over the quadrature interval. This average can also be written as a Dunford-Taylor integral. We
first analyze the error between this quadrature and the semi-discrete approximation. To develop
a fully discrete method, we then introduce sinc quadrature approximations to the Dunford-Taylor
integrals for computing the averages.
