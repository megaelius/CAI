Special conformal field theories can have symmetry groups which are interesting sporadic finite
simple groups. Famous examples include the Monster symmetry group of a $c=24$ two-dimensional
conformal field theory (CFT) constructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman, and the Conway symmetry
group of a $c=12$ CFT explored in detail by Duncan and Mack-Crane. The Mathieu moonshine connection
between the K3 elliptic genus and the Mathieu group $M_{24}$ has led to the study of K3 sigma models
with large symmetry groups. A particular K3 CFT with a maximal symmetry group preserving $(4,4)$
superconformal symmetry was studied in beautiful work by Gaberdiel, Taormina, Volpato, and Wendland.
The present paper shows that in both the GTVW and $c=12$ theories the construction of superconformal
generators can be understood via the theory of quantum error correcting codes. The automorphism
groups of these codes lift to symmetry groups in the CFT preserving the superconformal generators.
In the case of the $N=1$ supercurrent of the GTVW model our result, combined with a result of T. Johnson-Freyd
implies the symmetry group is the maximal subgroup of $M_{24}$ known as the sextet group. (The sextet
group is also known as the holomorph of the hexacode.) Building on \cite{gtvw} the Ramond-Ramond
sector of the GTVW model is related to the Miracle Octad Generator which in turn leads to a role for
the Golay code as a group of symmetries of RR states. Moreover, $(4,1)$ superconformal symmetry
suffices to define and decompose the elliptic genus of a K3 sigma model into characters of the $N=4$
superconformal algebra. The symmetry group preserving $(4,1)$ is larger than that preserving
$(4,4)$.
