The Controlled Loosening-up (CLuP) mechanism that we recently introduced in \cite{Stojnicclupint19}
is a generic concept that can be utilized to solve a large class of problems in polynomial time. Since
it relies in its core on an iterative procedure, the key to its excellent performance lies in a typically
very small number of iterations needed to execute the entire algorithm. In a separate paper \cite{Stojnicclupcmpl19},
we presented a detailed complexity analysis that indeed confirms the relatively small number of
iterations. Since both papers, \cite{Stojnicclupint19} and \cite{Stojnicclupcmpl19} are the
introductory papers on the topic we made sure to limit the initial discussion just to the core of the
algorithm and consequently focused only on the algorithm's most basic version. On numerous occasions
though, we emphasized that various improvements and further upgrades are possible. In this paper
we present a first step in this direction and discuss a very simple upgrade that can be introduced
on top of the basic CLuP mechanism. It relates to the starting of the CLuP and suggests the well-known
so-called polytope-relaxation heuristic (see, e.g. \cite{StojnicBBSD05,StojnicBBSD08})
as the starting point. We refer to this variant of CLuP as the CLuP-plt and proceed with the presentation
of its complexity analysis. As in \cite{Stojnicclupcmpl19}, a particular \textbf{\emph{complexity
analysis per iteration level}} type of complexity analysis is chosen and presented through the
algorithm's application on the well-known MIMO ML detection problem. As expected, the analysis
confirms that CLuP-plt performs even better than the original CLuP. In some of the most interesting
regimes it often achieves within the \textbf{\emph{first three iterations}} an excellent performance.
We also complement the theoretical findings with a solid set of numerical experiments.
