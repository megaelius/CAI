In many tomographic imaging problems the data consist of integrals along lines or curves. Increasingly
we encounter "rich tomography" problems where the quantity imaged is higher dimensional than a
scalar per voxel, including vectors tensors and functions. The data can also be higher dimensional
and in many cases consists of a one or two dimensional spectrum for each ray. In many such cases the
data contain not just integrals along rays but the distribution of values along the ray. If this is
discretized into bins we can think of this as a histogram. In this paper we introduce the concept of
"histogram tomography". For scalar problems with histogram data this holds the possibility of
reconstruction with fewer rays. In vector and tensor problems it holds the promise of reconstruction
of images that are in the null space of related integral transforms. For scalar histogram tomography
problems we show how bins in the histogram correspond to reconstructing level sets of function,
while moments of the distribution are the x-ray transform of powers of the unknown function. In the
vector case we give a reconstruction procedure for potential components of the field. We demonstrate
how the histogram longitudinal ray transform data can be extracted from Bragg edge neutron spectral
data and hence, using moments, a non-linear system of partial differential equations derived for
the strain tensor. In x-ray diffraction tomography of strain the transverse ray transform can be
deduced from the diffraction pattern the full histogram transverse ray transform cannot. We give
an explicit example of distributions of strain along a line that produce the same diffraction pattern,
and characterize the null space of the relevant transform.
