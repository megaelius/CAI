Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system transmission is a popular diversity technique to
improve the reliability of a communication system where transmitter, communication channel and
receiver are the important elements. Data transmission reliability can be ensured when the bit
error rate is very low. Normally, multiple antenna elements are used at both the transmitting and
receiving section in MIMO Systems. MIMO system utilizes antenna diversity or spatial diversity
coding system in wireless channels because wireless channels severely suffer from multipath fading
in which the transmitted signal is reflected along various multiple paths before reaching to the
destination or receiving section.Parallel transmission of MIMO system has also been implemented
where both the real part and imaginary part of the original, detected and the corresponding received
data sequence has been described graphically. The MIMO channel average capacity is achieved more
than 80% for dissimilar levels of impairments in transceiver when the value of kappa (Level of impairments
in transmitter hardware) reduces from 0.02 to 0.005. The finite-SNR multiplexing gain (Proportion
of MIMO system capacity to SISO system capacity) has been observed for deterministic and uncorrelated
Rayleigh fading channels correspondingly. The core difference is in the high SNR level. It may occur
for two reasons: (a) there is a quicker convergence to the limits under transceiver impairments
(b) deterministic channels that are built on digital architectural plans or topographical maps
of the propagation environment acquire an asymptotic gain superior than multiplexing gain when
the number of transmitting antenna is greater than the number of receiving antenna.
