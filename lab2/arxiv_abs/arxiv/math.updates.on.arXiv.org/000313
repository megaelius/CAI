After having investigated the regular prisms and prism tilings in the $\SLR$ space in the previous
work \cite{Sz13-1} of the second author, we consider the problem of geodesic ball packings related
to those tilings and their symmetry groups $\mathbf{pq2_1}$. $\SLR$ is one of the eight Thurston
geometries that can be derived from the 3-dimensional Lie group of all $2\times 2$ real matrices
with determinant one. In this paper we consider geodesic spheres and balls in $\SLR$ (even in $\mathbf{SL_{\mathrm{2}}R})$,
if their radii $\rho\in [0, \frac{\pi}{2})$, and determine their volumes. Moreover, we consider
the prisms of the above space and compute their volumes, define the notion of the geodesic ball packing
and its density. We develop a procedure to determine the densities of the densest geodesic ball packings
for the tilings, or in this paper more precisely, for their generating groups $\mathbf{pq2_1}$
(for integer rotational parameters $p,q$; $3\le p, \frac{2p}{p-2} <q$). We look for those parameters
$p$ and $q$ above, where the packing density large enough as possible. Now our record is $0.567362$
for $(p, q) = (8, 10)$. These computations seem to be important, since we do not know optimal ball packing,
namely in the hyperbolic space $\HYP$. We know only the density upper bound 0.85326, realized by
horoball packing of $\HYP$ to its ideal regular simplex tiling. Surprisingly, for the so-called
translation ball packings under the same groups $\mathbf{pq2_1}$ in \cite{MSzV13} we have got
larger density $0.841700$ for $(p, q) = (5, 10000 \rightarrow \infty)$ close to the above upper bound.
We use for the computation and visualization of the $\SLR$ space its projective model introduced
by the first author in \cite{M97}.
