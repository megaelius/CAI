Weakly complete real or complex associative algebras $A$ are necessarily projective limits of
finite dimensional algebras. Their group of units $A^{-1}$ is a pro-Lie group with the associated
topological Lie algebra $A_{\rm Lie}$ of $A$ as Lie algebra and the globally defined exponential
function $\exp\colon A\to A^{-1}$ as the exponential function of $A^{-1}$. With each topological
group $G$, a weakly complete group algebra ${\bf K}[G]$ is associated functorially so that the functor
$G\mapsto {\bf K}[G]$ is left adjoint to $A\mapsto A^{-1}$. The group algebra ${\bf K}[G]$ is a weakly
complete Hopf algebra. If $G$ is compact, then ${\cal R}[G]$ contains $G$ as the set of grouplike
elements. The category of all real weakly complete Hopf algebras $A$ with a compact group of grouplike
elements whose linear span is dense in $A$ is equivalent to the category of compact groups. The group
algebra $A={\cal R}[G]$ of a compact group $G$ contains a copy of the Lie algebra ${\frak L}(G)$ in
$A_{\rm Lie}$; it also contains all probability measures on $G$. The dual of the group algebra ${\cal
R}[G]$ is the Hopf algebra ${\cal R}(G,{\bf R})$ of representative functions of $G$. The rather
straightforward duality between vector spaces and weakly complete vector spaces thus becomes
the basis of a duality ${\cal R}(G,{\bf R})\leftrightarrow {\cal R}[G]$ and thus yields a new aspect
of Tannaka duality. In the case of a compact abelian $G$, an alternative concrete construction of
${\bf K}[G]$ is given both for $\bf K=\bf C$ and $\bf K=\bf R$. Because of the presence of ${\frak L}(G)$,
the enveloping algebras of weakly complete Lie algebras are introduced and placed into relation
with ${\bf K}[G]$.
