We extend the peeling exploration introduced in arxiv:1506.01590 to the setting of Boltzmann planar
maps coupled to a rigid $O(n)$ loop model. Its law is related to a class of discrete Markov processes
obtained by confining random walks to the positive integers with a new type of boundary condition.
As an application we give a rigorous justification of the phase diagram of the model presented in
arXiv:1106.0153. This entails two results pertaining to the so-called fixed-point equation:
the first asserts that any solution determines a well-defined model, while the second result, contributed
by Chen in the appendix, establishes precise existence criteria. A scaling limit for the exploration
process is identified in terms of a new class of positive self-similar Markov processes, going under
the name of ricocheted stable processes. As an application we study distances on loop-decorated
maps arising from a particular first passage percolation process on the maps. In the scaling limit
these distances between the boundary and a marked point are related to exponential integrals of
certain L\'evy processes. The distributions of the latter can be identified in a fairly explicit
form using machinery of positive self-similar Markov processes. Finally we observe a relation
between the number of loops that surround a marked vertex in a Boltzmann loop-decorated map and the
winding angle of a simple random walk on the square lattice. As a corollary we give a combinatorial
proof of the fact that the total winding angle around the origin of a simple random walk started at
$(p,p)$ and killed upon hitting $(0,0)$ normalized by $\log p$ converges in distribution to a Cauchy
random variable.
