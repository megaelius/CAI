Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cost-effective solution for achieving high spectrum
and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by leveraging massive low-cost passive elements
that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts. Prior works on IRS mainly consider
continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement
due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-aided wireless network,
where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication
from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users. We aim to minimize the
transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the
discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer
non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we
first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal
algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with
continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain
in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional
power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs
for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some
are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our performance analysis as well as the effectiveness
of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.
