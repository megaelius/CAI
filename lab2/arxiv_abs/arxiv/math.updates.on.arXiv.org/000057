A sequel to \cite{gW05}, we address again the single commutator problem \cite{PT71} of Pearcy and
Topping: Is every compact operator a single commutator of compact operators? by focusing on a 35
year old test question for this posed in 1976 by the last named author and others: Are there any strictly
positive operators that are single commutators of compact operators? The latter we settle here
affirmatively with a modest modification of Anderson's fundamental construction \cite{jA77}
constructing compact operators whose commutator is a rank one projection. Moreover we provide
here a rich class of such strictly positive operators that are commutators of compact operators
and pose a question for the rest. We explain also how these methods are related to the study of staircase
matrix forms, their equivalent block tri-diagonal forms, and commutator problems. In particular,
we present the original test question and solution that led to the negative solution of the Pearcy-Topping
question on whether or not every trace class trace zero operator was a commutator (or linear combination
of commutators) of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. And we show how this evolved from staircase form
considerations along with a Larry Brown result on trace connections to ideals \cite{lB94} which
itself is at the core of \cite[Section 7]{DFWW}. The omission in \cite{gW05} of this important 35
year old test question was inadvertent and we correct that in this paper. This sequel starts where
[ibid] left off but can be read independently of [ibid]. The present paper also has a section on self-commutator
equations $[X^*,X]=A$ within the framework of some classical operator Lie algebras. That problem
was solved by Fan and Fong (1980) for the full algebra of compact operators, and we solve it here for
the complex symplectic Lie algebra of compact operators and for complex semisimple Lie algebras.
