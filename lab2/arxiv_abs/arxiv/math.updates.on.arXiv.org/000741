Let $X$ be a $d$-dimensional L\'evy process with L\'evy triplet $(\Sigma,\nu,\alpha)$ and $d\geq
2$. Given the low frequency observations $(X_t)_{t=1,\ldots,n}$, the dependence structure of
the jumps of $X$ is estimated. The L\'evy measure $\nu$ describes the average jump behavior in a time
unit. Thus, the aim is to estimate the dependence structure of $\nu$ by estimating the L\'evy copula
$\mathfrak{C}$ of $\nu$, cf. Kallsen and Tankov \cite{KalTan}. We use the low frequency techniques
presented in a one dimensional setting in Neumann and Rei{\ss} \cite{NeuRei} and Nickl and Rei{\ss}
\cite{NicRei} to construct a L\'evy copula estimator $\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_n$ based on the
above $n$ observations. In doing so we prove $$\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_n\to \mathfrak{C},\quad
n\to\infty$$ uniformly on compact sets bounded away from zero with the convergence rate $\sqrt{\log
n}$. This convergence holds under quite general assumptions, which also include L\'evy triplets
with $\Sigma\neq 0$ and $\nu$ of arbitrary Blumenthal-Getoor index $0\leq\beta\leq 2$. Note that
in a low frequency observation scheme, it is statistically difficult to distinguish between infinitely
many small jumps and a Brownian motion part. Hence, the rather slow convergence rate $\sqrt{\log
n}$ is not surprising. In the complementary case of a compound Poisson process (CPP), an estimator
$\widehat{C}_n$ for the copula $C$ of the jump distribution of the CPP is constructed under the same
observation scheme. This copula $C$ is the analogue to the L\'evy copula $\mathfrak{C}$ in the finite
jump activity case, i.e. the CPP case. Here we establish $$\widehat{C}_n \to C,\quad n\to\infty$$
with the convergence rate $\sqrt{n}$ uniformly on compact sets bounded away from zero. Both convergence
rates are optimal in the sense of Neumann and Rei{\ss}.
