The Reduced Basis Method (RBM) is a rigorous model reduction approach for solving parametrized
partial differential equations. It identifies a low-dimensional subspace for approximation
of the parametric solution manifold that is embedded in high-dimensional space. A reduced order
model is subsequently constructed in this subspace. RBM relies on residual-based error indicators
or {\em a posteriori} error bounds to guide construction of the reduced solution subspace, to serve
as a stopping criteria, and to certify the resulting surrogate solutions. Unfortunately, it is
well-known that the standard algorithm for residual norm computation suffers from premature stagnation
at the level of the square root of machine precision. In this paper, we develop two alternatives to
the standard offline phase of reduced basis algorithms. First, we design a robust strategy for computation
of residual error indicators that allows RBM algorithms to enrich the solution subspace with accuracy
beyond root machine precision. Secondly, we propose a new error indicator based on the Lebesgue
function in interpolation theory. This error indicator does not require computation of residual
norms, and instead only requires the ability to compute the RBM solution. This residual-free indicator
is rigorous in that it bounds the error committed by the RBM approximation, but up to an uncomputable
multiplicative constant. Because of this, the residual-free indicator is effective in choosing
snapshots during the offline RBM phase, but cannot currently be used to certify error that the approximation
commits. However, it circumvents the need for \textit{a posteriori} analysis of numerical methods,
and therefore can be effective on problems where such a rigorous estimate is hard to derive.
