Let $n \geq 3$. In this paper, we study the problem of whether a given finite group $G$ embeds in a quotient
of the form $B_n/\Gamma_k(P_n)$, where $B_n$ is the $n$-string Artin braid group, $k \in \{2, 3\}$,
and $\{\Gamma_l(P_n)\}_{l\in \mathbb{N}}$ is the lower central series of the $n$-string pure
braid group $P_n$. Previous results show that a necessary condition for such an embedding to exist
is that $|G|$ is odd (resp. is relatively prime with $6$) if $k=2$ (resp. $k=3$), where $|G|$ denotes
the order of $G$. We show that any finite group $G$ of odd order (resp. of order relatively prime with
$6$) embeds in $B_{|G|}/\Gamma_2(P_{|G|})$ (resp. in $B_{|G|}/\Gamma_3(P_{|G|})$). The result
in the case of $B_{|G|}/\Gamma_2(P_{|G|})$ has been proved independently by Beck and Marin. One
may then ask whether $G$ embeds in a quotient of the form $B_n/\Gamma_k(P_n)$, where $n < |G|$ and
$k \in \{2, 3\}$. If $G$ is of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r} \rtimes_{\theta} \mathbb{Z}_d$, where
the action $\theta$ is injective, $p$ is an odd prime (resp. $p \geq 5$ is prime) $d$ is odd (resp. $d$
is relatively prime with $6$) and divides $p-1$, we show that $G$ embeds in $B_{p^r}/\Gamma_2(P_{p^r})$
(resp. in $B_{p^r}/\Gamma_3(P_{p^r})$). In the case $k=2$, this extends a result of Marin concerning
the embedding of the Frobenius groups in $B_n/\Gamma_2(P_n)$, and is a special case of another result
of Beck and Marin. Finally, we construct an explicit embedding in $B_9/\Gamma_2(P_9)$ of the two
non-Abelian groups of order $27$, namely the semi-direct product $\mathbb{Z}_9 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_3$,
where the action is given by multiplication by $4$, and the Heisenberg group mod $3$.
