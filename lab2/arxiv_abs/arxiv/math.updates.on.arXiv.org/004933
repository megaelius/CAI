As for the theory of maximal representations, we introduce the volume of a Zimmer's cocycle $\Gamma
\times X \rightarrow \mbox{PO}^\circ(n, 1)$, where $\Gamma$ is a torsion-free (non-)uniform
lattice in $\mbox{PO}^\circ(n, 1)$, with $n \geq 3$, and $X$ is a suitable standard Borel probability
$\Gamma$-space. Our numerical invariant extends the volume of representations for (non-)uniform
lattices to measurable cocycles and in the uniform setting it agrees with the generalized version
of the Euler number of self-couplings. We prove that our volume of cocycles satisfies a Milnor-Wood
type inequality in terms of the volume of the manifold $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^n$. This invariant
can be interpreted as a suitable multiplicative constant between bounded cohomology classes.
This allows us to characterize maximal cocycles for being cohomologous to the cocycle induced by
the standard lattice embedding via a measurable map $X \rightarrow \mbox{PO}(n, 1)$ with essentially
constant sign. As a by-product of our rigidity result for the volume of cocycles, we give a new proof
of the mapping degree theorem. This allows us to provide a complete characterization of maps homotopic
to local isometries between closed hyperbolic manifolds in terms of maximal cocycles. In dimension
$n = 2$, we introduce the notion of Euler number of measurable cocycles associated to closed surface
groups. It extends the classic Euler number of representations and it agrees with the generalized
version of the Euler number of self-couplings up to a multiplicative constant. We show a Milnor-Wood
type inequality whose upper bound is given by the modulus of the Euler characteristic. This gives
an alternative proof of the same result for the generalized version of the Euler number of self-couplings.
Finally, we characterize maximal cocycles as those which are cohomologous to the one induced by
a hyperbolization.
