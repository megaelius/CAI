We present a possible kind of generalization of the notion of ordered pairs of cyclic maps and coupled
fixed points and its application in modelling of equilibrium in oligopoly markets. We have obtained
sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of fixed (or best proximity) points in complete
metric spaces (uniformly convex Banach spaces). We get an error estimates of the fixed (or best proximity),
provided that we have used sequences of successive iterations. We illustrate one possible application
of the results by building a pragmatic model on competition in oligopoly markets. To achieve this
goal, we use an approach based on studying the response functions of each market participant, thus
making it possible to address both Cournot and Bertrand industrial structures with unified formal
method. In contrast to the restrictive theoretical constructs of duopoly equilibrium, our study
is able to account for real-world limitations like minimal sustainable production levels and exclusive
access to certain resources. We prove and demonstrate that by using carefully constructed response
functions it is possible to build and calibrate a model that reflects different competitive strategies
used in extremely concentrated markets. The response functions approach makes it also possible
to take into consideration different barriers to entry. By fitting to the response functions rather
than the profit maximization of the payoff functions problem we alter the classical optimization
problem to a problem of coupled fixed points, which has the benefit that considering corner optimum,
corner equilibria and convexity condition of the payoff function can be skipped.
