In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of interest in the stability of a finitely-generated
group $\Gamma$ with respect to a sequence of groups $\left\{G_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$,
equipped with bi-invariant metrics $\left\{d_{n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. We consider the
case $G_{n}=\operatorname{U}\left(n\right)$ (resp. $G_{n}=\operatorname{Sym}\left(n\right)$),
equipped with the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt metric $d_{n}^{\operatorname{HS}}$ (resp. the
normalized Hamming metric $d_{n}^{\operatorname{Hamming}}$). Our main result is that if $\Gamma$
is infinite, hyperlinear (resp. sofic) and has Property $\operatorname{(T)}$, then it is not stable
with respect to $\left(\operatorname{U}\left(n\right),d_{n}^{\operatorname{HS}}\right)$
(resp. $\left(\operatorname{Sym}\left(n\right),d_{n}^{\operatorname{Hamming}}\right)$).
This answers a question of Hadwin and Shulman regarding the stability of $\operatorname{SL}_{3}\left(\mathbb{Z}\right)$.
We also deduce that the mapping class group $\operatorname{MCG}\left(g\right)$, $g\geq 3$, and
$\operatorname{Aut}\left(\mathbb{F}_n\right)$, $n\geq 3$, are not stable with respect to $\left(\operatorname{Sym}\left(n\right),d_{n}^{\operatorname{Hamming}}\right)$.
Our main result exhibits a difference between stability with respect to the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt
metric on $\operatorname{U}\left(n\right)$ and the (unnormalized) $p$-Schatten metrics, since
many groups with Property $\operatorname{(T)}$ are stable with respect to the latter metrics,
as shown by De Chiffre-Glebsky-Lubotzky-Thom and Lubotzky-Oppenheim. We suggest a more flexible
notion of stability that may repair this deficiency of stability with respect to $\left(\operatorname{U}\left(n\right),d_{n}^{\operatorname{HS}}\right)$
and $\left(\operatorname{Sym}\left(n\right),d_{n}^{\operatorname{Hamming}}\right)$.
