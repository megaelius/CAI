Riesz representation theorem, Daniell-Stone theorem for Daniell integrals and Stone's representation
theorem for probability and measure algebras are three important classical results in analysis
concerning existence of measures with certain properties. Many proofs of these theorems can be
found in the literature of analysis, from elementary ones which use ordinary techniques from measure
theory, to more sophisticated ones, such as those employing techniques from nonstandard analysis,
in particular for Riesz representation theorem. In this paper, as the first goal, we give new proofs
for all these three theorems. Our proofs have a mild logical flavor and are uniform in the sense that
they are all based on the same general idea and rely on the application of the same technical tool from
logic to measure theory, namely logical compactness theorem. In fact, as the second goal of the paper,
we try to reveal more the power of logical methods in analysis in particular measure theory, and make
stronger connections between analysis and logic. We use the setting of "integration logic" which
is a logical framework (and one of the forms of probability logics) for studying measure and probability
structures by logical means. Indeed, we elaborate this setting and use its expressive power and
a version of compactness theorem holding in it to show its application in measure theory by giving
new proofs for the above-mentioned measure existence theorems. As mentioned, an advantage of these
proofs is that they are all given in a uniform way since they are all based on the logical compactness
theorem. The paper is mostly written for general mathematicians, in particular the people active
in analysis or logic as the main audience. So it is self-contained and the reader does not need to have
any advanced prerequisite knowledge from logic or measure theory.
