In the first part, we define and investigate new classes of almost 3-contact metric manifolds, with
two guiding ideas in mind: first, what geometric objects are best suited for capturing the key properties
of almost 3-contact metric manifolds, and second, the newly defined classes should admit 'good'
metric connections with skew torsion. In particular, we introduce the Reeb commutator function
and the Reeb Killing function, we define the new classes of canonical almost 3-contact metric manifolds
and of 3-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds (including as special cases 3-Sasaki manifolds,
quaternionic Heisenberg groups, and many others) and prove that the latter are hypernormal, thus
generalizing a seminal result by Kashiwada. We study their behaviour under a new class of deformations,
called $\mathcal{H}$-homothetic deformations, and prove that they admit an underlying quaternionic
contact structure, from which we deduce the Ricci curvature. For example, a 3-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki
manifold is Einstein either if $\alpha=\delta$ (the 3-$\alpha$-Sasaki case) or if $\delta=(2n+3)\alpha$,
where $\dim M=4n+3$. The second part is actually devoted to finding these adapted connections.
We start with a very general notion of $\varphi$-compatible connections, where $\varphi$ denotes
any element of the associated sphere of almost contact structures, and make them unique by a certain
extra condition, thus yielding the notion of canonical connection (they exist exactly on canonical
manifolds, hence the name). For 3-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds, we compute the torsion
of this connection explicitly and we prove that it is parallel, we describe the holonomy, the $\nabla$-Ricci
curvature, and we show that the metric cone is a HKT-manifold. In dimension 7, we construct a cocalibrated
$G_2$-structure inducing the canonical connection and we prove the existence of four generalized
Killing spinors.
