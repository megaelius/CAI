The inverse acoustic obstacle problems using multi-frequency backscattering far field patterns
at isolated directions are studied. The obstacle could be sound soft or sound hard. We show that the
smallest strip containing the obstacle can be uniquely determined by the backscattering far field
patterns for all frequencies in a bounded interval at two observation directions. Thus, a support
of the obstacle can be determined with multi-frequency far field patterns at $2n$ observation directions.
Here, $n$ is the spatial dimension. The key ingredients are the Kirchhoff approximation and the
Fourier transform. Some direct sampling methods using a few multi-frequency backscattering far
field patterns are then proposed to reconstruct the obstacle. An important feature of these direct
sampling methods is that the indicators are computed only at the sampling points on a line parallel
to the observation direction. With the increase of the observation directions, the location and
shape can be well captured, even the obstacle has concave part or multiple multi-scalar components.
The point like scatterers are also considered. We show that the multi-frequency backscattering
far field patterns at a single observation direction are enough to determining the hyper planes
containing the point like scatterers. The indicators used for extended obstacles are also applicable
for point like scatterers. As an extension, a novel direct sampling method is proposed for phaseless
inverse problem with sparse phaseless backscattering data. Numerical examples in two dimensions
are presented to validity the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed direct sampling methods.
