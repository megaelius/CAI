The chemical master equation (CME) is frequently used in systems biology to quantify the effects
of stochastic fluctuations that arise due to biomolecular species with low copy numbers. The CME
is a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the evolution of probability density
for each population vector in the state-space of the stochastic reaction dynamics. For many examples
of interest, this state-space is infinite, making it difficult to obtain exact solutions of the
CME. To deal with this problem, the Finite State Projection (FSP) algorithm was developed by Munsky
and Khammash (Jour. Chem. Phys. 2006), to provide approximate solutions to the CME by truncating
the state-space. The FSP works well for finite time-periods but it cannot be used for estimating
the stationary solutions of CMEs, which are often of interest in systems biology. The aim of this
paper is to develop a version of FSP which we refer to as the stationary FSP (sFSP) that allows one to
obtain accurate approximations of the stationary solutions of a CME by solving a finite linear-algebraic
system that yields the stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain over the truncated
state-space. We derive bounds for the approximation error incurred by sFSP and we establish that
under certain stability conditions, these errors can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately
expanding the truncated state-space. We provide several examples to illustrate our sFSP method
and demonstrate its efficiency in estimating the stationary distributions. In particular, we
show that using a quantised tensor train (QTT) implementation of our sFSP method, problems admitting
more than 100 million states can be efficiently solved.
