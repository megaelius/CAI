In the present article we introduce and study a class of topological reflection spaces that we call
Kac-Moody symmetric spaces. These generalize Riemannian symmetric spaces of non-compact type.
We observe that in a non-spherical Kac-Moody symmetric space there exist pairs of points that do
not lie on a common geodesic; however, any two points can be connected by a chain of geodesic segments.
We moreover classify maximal flats in Kac-Moody symmetric spaces and study their intersection
patterns, leading to a classification of global and local automorphisms. Unlike Riemannian symmetric
spaces, non-spherical non-affine irreducible Kac-Moody symmetric spaces also admit an invariant
causal structure. For causal and anti-causal geodesic rays with respect to this structure we find
a notion of asymptoticity, which allows us to define a future and past boundary of such Kac-Moody
symmetric space. We show that these boundaries carry a natural polyhedral structure and are cellularly
isomorphic to the halves of the geometric realization of the twin buildings of the underlying split
real Kac-Moody group. We also show that every automorphism of the symmetric space is uniquely determined
by the induced cellular automorphism of the future and past boundary. The invariant causal structure
on a non-spherical non-affine irreducible Kac-Moody symmetric space gives rise to an invariant
pre-order on the underlying space, and thus to a subsemigroup of the Kac-Moody group. We conclude
that while in some aspects Kac-Moody symmetric spaces closely resemble Riemannian symmetric spaces,
in other aspects they behave similarly to ordered affine hovels, their non-Archimedean cousins.
