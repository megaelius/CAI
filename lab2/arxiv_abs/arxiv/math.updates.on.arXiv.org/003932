We study the stability and instability of the Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequality, in terms
of covariance, Wasserstein distance and Fisher information, addressing several open questions
in the literature. We first establish an improved logarithmic Sobolev inequality which is at the
same time scale invariant and dimension free. As a corollary, we show that if the covariance of the
measure is bounded by the identity, one may obtain a sharp and dimension-free stability bound in
terms of the Fisher information matrix. We then investigate under what conditions stability estimates
control the covariance, and when such control is impossible. For the class of measures whose covariance
matrix is dominated by the identity, we obtain optimal dimension-free stability bounds which show
that the deficit in the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is minimized by Gaussian measures, under
a fixed covariance constraint. On the other hand, we construct examples showing that without the
boundedness of the covariance, the inequality is not stable. Finally, we study stability in terms
of the Wasserstein distance, and show that even for the class of measures with a bounded covariance
matrix, it is hopeless to obtain a dimension-free stability result. The counterexamples provided
motivate us to put forth a new notion of stability, in terms of proximity to mixtures of the Gaussian
distribution. We prove new estimates (some dimension-free) based on this notion. These estimates
are strictly stronger than some of the existing stability results in terms of the Wasserstein metric.
Our proof techniques rely heavily on stochastic methods.
