We investigate some genuine Poisson geometric objects in the modular theory of an arbitrary von
Neumann algebra $\mathfrak{M}$. Specifically, for any standard form realization $(\mathfrak{M},\mathcal{H},J,\mathcal{P})$,
we find a canonical foliation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, whose leaves are Banach manifolds
that are weakly immersed into~$\mathcal{H}$, thereby endowing $\mathcal{H}$ with a richer Banach
manifold structure to be denoted by $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}$. We also find that $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}$
has the structure of a Banach-Lie groupoid $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}\rightrightarrows\mathfrak{M}_*^+$
which is isomorphic to the action groupoid $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{M})\ast\mathfrak{M}_*^+\rightrightarrows\mathfrak{M}_*^+$
defined by the natural action of the Banach-Lie groupoid of partial isometries $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{M})\rightrightarrows\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{M})$
on the positive cone in the predual $\mathfrak{M}_*^+$, where $\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{M})$ is
the projection lattice of $\mathfrak{M}$. There is also a presymplectic form $\widetilde{\boldsymbol\omega}\in\Omega^2(\widetilde{\mathcal{H}})$
that comes fom the scalar product of $\mathcal{H}$ and is multiplicative in the usual sense of finite-dimensional
Lie groupoid theory. We further show that the groupoid $(\widetilde{\mathcal{H}},\widetilde{\boldsymbol\omega})\rightrightarrows
\mathfrak{M}_*^+$ shares several other properties of finite-dimensional presymplectic groupoids
and we investigate the Poisson manifold structures of its orbits as well as the leaf space the foliation
defined by the degeneracy kernel of the presymplectic form~$\widetilde{\boldsymbol\omega}$.
