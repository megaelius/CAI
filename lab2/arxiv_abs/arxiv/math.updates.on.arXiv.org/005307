In the spatial channel models used in multi-antenna wireless communications, the propagation
from a single-antenna transmitter (e.g., a user) to an M-antenna receiver (e.g., a Base Station)
occurs through scattering clusters located in the far field of the receiving antenna array. The
Angular Spread Function (ASF) of the corresponding M-dim channel vector describes the angular
density of the received signal power at the array. The modern literature on massive MIMO has recognized
that the knowledge of covariance matrix of user channel vectors is very useful for various applications
such as hybrid digital analog beamforming, pilot decontamination, etc. Therefore, most literature
has focused on the estimation of such channel covariance matrices. However, in some applications
such as uplink-downlink covariance transformation (for FDD massive MIMO precoding) and channel
sounding some form of ASF estimation is required either implicitly or explicitly. It turns out that
while covariance estimation is well-known and well-conditioned, the ASF estimation is a much harder
problem and is in general ill-posed. In this paper, we show that under additional geometrically-consistent
group-sparsity structure on the ASF, which is prevalent in almost all wireless propagation scenarios,
one is able to estimate ASF properly. We propose sparse dictionary-based algorithms that promote
this group-sparsity structure via suitable regularizations. Since generally it is difficult
to capture the notion of group-sparsity through proper regularization, we propose another algorithm
based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that learns this structure. We provide numerical simulations
to assess the performance of our proposed algorithms. We also compare the results with that of other
methods in the literature, where we re-frame those methods in the context of ASF estimation in massive
MIMO.
