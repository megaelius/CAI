Advantage is taken of the arbitrariness in energy reference to consider a new integral transcriptions
of Schrodinger's equation in the presence of potentials which at infinity acquire constant, non-vanishing
values. It is found possible to present for the probability amplitude $\psi$ a linear integral equation
which is entirely devoid of explicit reference to the wave function incident from infinity, and
thus differs markedly from the prevailing inhomogeneous formulation. Identity of the homogeneous
equation with an inhomogeneous statement which is at the same time available is affirmed in general
terms with the aid of the Fourier transformation, and is then still further reinforced by application
of both formalisms to the particular example of a spherical potential barrier/well. Identical,
closed-form outcomes are gotten in each case for wave function eigenmode expansion coefficients
on both scatterer interior and exterior. Admittedly, the solution procedure is far simpler in the
inhomogeneous setting, wherein it exhibits the aspect of a direct, leapfrog advance, unburdened
by any implicit algebraic entanglement. By contrast, the homogeneous path, of considerably greater
length, insists, at each mode index, upon an exterior/interior coefficient entanglement, an entanglement
which, happily, is no more severe than that of a non-singular two-by-two linear system. Each such
two-by-two linear system reproduces of course the output already gotten under the inhomogeneous
route, and is indeed identical to the two-by-two system encountered during the routine procedure
wherein continuity is demanded at the barrier/well interface of both $\psi$ and its radial derivative.
