The Full Dimension-MIMO (FD-MIMO) technology is capable of achieving huge improvements in network
throughput with simultaneous connectivity of a large number of mobile wireless devices, unmanned
aerial vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In FD-MIMO, with a large number of antennae at
the base station and the ability to perform beamforming, the capacity of the physical downlink shared
channel (PDSCH) has increased a lot. However, the current specifications of the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) does not allow the base station to perform beamforming techniques for
the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), and hence, PDCCH has neither the capacity nor the
coverage of PDSCH. Therefore, PDCCH capacity will still limit the performance of a network as it
dictates the number of users that can be scheduled at a given time instant. In Release 11, 3GPP introduced
enhanced PDCCH (EPDCCH) to increase the PDCCH capacity at the cost of sacrificing the PDSCH resources.
The problem of enhancing the PDCCH capacity within the available control channel resources has
not been addressed yet in the literature. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel beamformed PDCCH
(BF-PDCCH) design which is aligned to the 3GPP specifications and requires simple software changes
at the base station. We rely on the sounding reference signals transmitted in the uplink to decide
the best beam for a user and ingeniously schedule the users in PDCCH. We perform system level simulations
to evaluate the performance of the proposed design and show that the proposed BF-PDCCH achieves
larger network throughput when compared with the current state of art algorithms, PDCCH and EPDCCH
schemes.
