The second part of our study is devoted to an analysis of the exactness of penalty functions for optimal
control problems with terminal and pointwise state constraints. We demonstrate that with the use
of the exact penalty function method one can reduce fixed-endpoint problems for linear time-varying
systems and linear evolution equations with convex constraints on the control inputs to completely
equivalent free-endpoint optimal control problems, if the terminal state belongs to the relative
interior of the reachable set. In the nonlinear case, we prove that a local reduction of fixed-endpoint
and variable-endpoint problems to equivalent free-endpoint ones is possible under the assumption
that the linearised system is completely controllable, and point out some general properties of
nonlinear systems under which a global reduction to equivalent free-endpoint problems can be achieved.
In the case of problems with pointwise state inequality constraints, we prove that such problems
for linear time-varying systems and linear evolution equations with convex state constraints
can be reduced to equivalent problems without state constraints, provided one uses the $L^{\infty}$
penalty term, and Slater's condition holds true, while for nonlinear systems a local reduction
is possible, if a natural constraint qualification is satisfied. Finally, we show that the exact
$L^p$-penalisation of state constraints with finite $p$ is possible for convex problems, if Lagrange
multipliers corresponding to the state constraints belong to $L^{p'}$, where $p'$ is the conjugate
exponent of $p$, and for general nonlinear problems, if the cost functional does not depend on the
control inputs explicitly.
