In \verb| arXiv:1212.5901 | we associated an algebra $\Gami(\fA)$ to every bornological algebra
$\fA$ and an ideal $I_{S(\fA)}\triqui\Gami(\fA)$ to every symmetric ideal $S\triqui\elli$.
We showed that $I_{S(\fA)}$ has $K$-theoretical properties which are similar to those of the projective
tensor product $\fA\hotimes J_S$ with ideal $J_S\triqui\cB$ of the algebra $\cB$ of bounded operators
in Hilbert space which corresponds to $S$ under Calkin's correspondence. In the current article
we compute the relative cyclic homology $HC_*(\Gami(\fA):I_{S(\fA)})$. Using these calculations,
and the results of \emph{loc. cit.}, we prove that if $\fA$ is a $C^*$-algebra and $c_0$ the symmetric
ideal of sequences vanishing at infinity, then $K_*(I_{c_0(\fA)})$ is homotopy invariant and
that if $*\ge 0$, it contains $K^{\top}_*(\fA)$ as a direct summand. This is a weak analogue of the
Suslin-Wodzicki theorem that says that for the ideal $\cK=J_{c_0}$ of compact operators and the
$C^*$-algebra tensor product $\fA\sotimes\cK$, we have $K_*(\fA\sotimes\cK)=K^{\top}_*(\fA)$.
Similarly, we prove that if $\fA$ is a unital Banach algebra and $\ell^{\infty-}=\bigcup_{q<\infty}\ell^q$,
then $K_*(I_{\ell^{\infty-}(\fA)})$ is invariant under H\"older continuous homotopies and
that for $*\ge 0$ it contains $K^{\top}_*(\fA)$ as a direct summand. These $K$-theoretic results
are obtained from cyclic homology computations. We also compute the relative cyclic homology groups
$HC_*(\Gami(\fA):I_{S(\fA)})$ in terms of $HC_*(\elli(\fA):I_{S(\fA)})$ for general $\fA$
and $S$. For $\fA=\C$ and general $S$, we further compute the latter groups in terms of algebraic
differential forms. We prove that the map $HC_n(\Gami(\C):I_{S(\C)})\to HC_n(\cB:J_S)$ is an
isomorphism in many cases.
