We propose numerical algorithms for solving large deformation diffeomorphic image registration
problems. We formulate the non-rigid image registration problem as a problem of optimal control.
This leads to an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization
problem. The PDE constraint consists, in its simplest form, of a hyperbolic transport equation
for the evolution of the image intensity. The control variable is the velocity field. Tikhonov regularization
ensures well-posedness. We consider standard smoothness regularization based on $H^1$- or $H^2$-norms
of the velocity field. We augment this regularization scheme with a constraint on the divergence
of the velocity field rendering the flow incompressible. We use a Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization
in space and a Chebyshev pseudo-spectral discretization in time. We use a preconditioned, matrix-free,
inexact Gauss-Newton-Krylov reduced space sequential quadratic programming (RSQP) method for
numerical optimization. A parameter continuation, which can intuitively be informed about regularity
requirements, is designed to estimate an optimal regularization parameter. Regularity is ensured
by controlling geometric features of the deformation field. Overall, we arrive at a black-box solver
that exploits computational tools precisely tailored for solving the optimality system. We study
spectral properties of the Hessian, grid convergence, numerical accuracy, computational efficiency,
and deformation regularity of our scheme. We compare the designed Gauss-Newton-Krylov RSQP method
with a Picard method. We study the influence of a varying number of unknowns in time. The reported
results demonstrate excellent numerical accuracy, guaranteed local deformation regularity,
and computational efficiency with an optional control on local mass conservation.
