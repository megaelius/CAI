Iterative hard thresholding (IHT), compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP), and subspace
pursuit (SP) are three types of mainstream compressed sensing algorithms using hard thresholding
operators for signal recovery and approximation. The guaranteed performance for signal recovery
via these algorithms has mainly been analyzed under the condition that the restricted isometry
constant of a sensing matrix, denoted by $ \delta_K$ (where $K$ is an integer number), is smaller
than a certain threshold value in the interval $(0,1).$ The condition $ \delta_{K}< \delta^*$ for
some number $ \delta^* \leq 1 $ ensuring the success of signal recovery with a specific compressed
sensing algorithm is called the restricted-isometry-property-based (RIP-based) bound for guaranteed
performance of the algorithm. At the moment the best known RIP-based bound for the guaranteed recovery
of $k$-sparse signals via IHT is $\delta_{3k}< 1/\sqrt{3}\approx 0.5773,$ the bound for guaranteed
recovery via CoSaMP is $\delta_{4k} < 0.4782, $ and the bound via SP is $ \delta_{3k} <0.4859.$ A fundamental
question in this area is whether such theoretical results can be further improved. The purpose of
this paper is to affirmatively answer this question and rigorously prove that the RIP-based bounds
for guaranteed performance of IHT can be significantly improved to $ \delta_{3k} < (\sqrt{5}-1)/2
\approx 0.618, $ the bound for CoSaMP can be improved and pushed to $ \delta_{4k}< 0.5593, $ and the
bound for SP can be improved to $ \delta_{3k} < 0.5108.$ These improvements are far from being trivial
and are achieved through establishing some deep properties of the hard thresholding operator and
certain tight error estimations by efficiently exploiting the structure of the underlying algorithms.
