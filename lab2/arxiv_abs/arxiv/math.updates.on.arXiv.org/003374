A fundamental concept in solving inverse problems is the use of regularizers, which yield more physical
and less-oscillatory solutions. Total variation (TV) has been widely used as an edge-preserving
regularizer. However, objects are often over-regularized by TV, becoming blob-like convex structures
of low curvature. This phenomenon was explained mathematically in the analysis of Andreau et al.
They have shown that a TV regularizer can spatially preserve perfectly sets which are nonlinear
eigenfunctions of the form $\lambda u \in \partial J_{TV}(u)$, where $\partial J_{TV}(u)$ is the
TV subdifferential. For TV, these shapes are convex sets of low-curvature. A compelling approach
to better preserve structures is to use anisotropic functionals, which adapt the regularization
in an image-driven manner, with strong regularization along edges and low across them. This follows
earlier ideas of Weickert on anisotropic diffusion, which do not stem directly from functional
minimization. Adaptive anisotropic TV (A$^2$TV) was successfully used in several studies in the
past decade. However, until now there is no theory formulating the type of structures which can be
perfectly preserved. In this study we address this question. We rely on a recently developed theory
of Burger et al on nonlinear spectral analysis of one-homogeneous functionals. We have that eigenfunction
sets, admitting $\lambda u \in \partial J_{A^2TV}(u)$, are perfectly preserved under A$^2$TV-flow
or minimization with $L^2$ square fidelity. We thus investigate these eigenfunctions theoretically
and numerically. We prove non-convex sets can be eigenfunctions in certain conditions and provide
numerical results which characterize well the relations between the degree of local anisotropy
of the functional and the admitted maximal curvature....
