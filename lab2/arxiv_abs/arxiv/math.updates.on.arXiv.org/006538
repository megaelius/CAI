We investigate a number of coloring problems restricted to bipartite graphs with bounded diameter.
We prove that the $k$-List Coloring, List $k$-Coloring, and $k$-Precoloring Extension problems
are NP-complete on bipartite graphs with diameter at most $d$, for every $k\ge 4$ and every $d\ge
3$, and for $k=3$ and $d\ge 4$, and that List $k$-Coloring is polynomial when $d=2$ (i.e., on complete
bipartite graphs) for every $k \geq 3$. Since $k$-List Coloring was already known to be NP-complete
on complete bipartite graphs, and polynomial for $k=2$ on general graphs, the only remaining open
problems are List $3$-Coloring and $3$-Precoloring Extension when $d=3$. We also prove that the
Surjective $C_6$-Homomorphism problem is NP-complete on bipartite graphs with diameter at most
$4$, answering a question posed by Bodirsky, K\'ara, and Martin [Discret. Appl. Math. 2012]. As
a byproduct, we get that deciding whether $V(G)$ can be partitioned into 3 subsets each inducing
a complete bipartite graph is NP-complete. An attempt to prove this result was presented by Fleischner,
Mujuni, Paulusma, and Szeider [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2009], but we realized that there was an apparently
non-fixable flaw in their proof. Finally, we prove that the $3$-Fall Coloring problem is NP-complete
on bipartite graphs with diameter at most $4$, and give a polynomial reduction from $3$-Fall Coloring
on bipartite graphs with diameter $3$ to $3$-Precoloring Extension on bipartite graphs with diameter
$3$. The latter result implies that if $3$-Fall Coloring is NP-complete on these graphs, then the
complexity gaps mentioned above for List $k$-Coloring and $k$-Precoloring Extension would be
closed. This would also answer a question posed by Kratochv\'il, Tuza, and Voigt [Proc. of WG 2002].
