Let $X$ be a quasicompact quasiseparated scheme. Write $\operatorname{Gal}(X)$ for the category
whose objects are geometric points of $X$ and whose morphisms are specializations in the \'etale
topology. We define a natural profinite topology on the category $\operatorname{Gal}(X)$ that
globalizes the topologies of the absolute Galois groups of the residue fields of the points of $X$.
One of the main results of this book is that $\operatorname{Gal}(X)$ variant of MacPherson's exit-path
category suitable for the \'etale topology: we construct an equivalence between representations
of $\operatorname{Gal}(X)$ and constructible sheaves on $X$. We show that this 'exodromy equivalence'
holds with nonabelian coefficients and with finite abelian coefficients. More generally, by using
the pyknotic/condensed formalism, we extend this equivalence to coefficients in the category
of modules over profinite rings and algebraic extensions of $\mathbf{Q}_{\ell}$. As an 'exit-path
category', the topological category $\operatorname{Gal}(X)$ also gives rise to a new, concrete
description of the \'etale homotopy type of $X$. We also prove a higher categorical form of Hochster
Duality, which reconstructs the entire \'etale topos of a quasicompact and quasiseparated scheme
from the topological category $\operatorname{Gal}(X)$. Appealing to Voevodsky's proof of a conjecture
of Grothendieck, we prove the following reconstruction theorem for normal varieties over a finitely
generated field $k$ of characteristic $0$: the functor $X\mapsto\operatorname{Gal}(X)$ from
normal $ k $-varieties to topological categories with an action of $\operatorname{G}_{k}$ and
equivariant functors that preserve minimal objects is fully faithful.
