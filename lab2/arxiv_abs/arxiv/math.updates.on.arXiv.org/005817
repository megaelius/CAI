Nicolas-Auguste Tissot (1824--1897) was a French mathematician and cartographer. He introduced
a tool which became known among geographers under the name ``Tissot indicatrix'', and which was
widely used during the first half of the twentieth century in cartography. This is a graphical representation
of a field of ellipses, indicating at each point of a geographical map the distorsion of this map,
both in direction and in magnitude. Each ellipse represented at a given point is the image of an infinitesimal
circle in the domain of the map (generally speaking, a sphere representing the surface of the earth)
by the projection that realizes the geographical map. Tissot studied extensively, from a mathematical
viewpoint, the distortion of mappings from the sphere onto the Euclidean plane, and he also developed
a theory for the distorsion of mappings between general surfaces. His ideas are close to those that
are at the origin of the work on quasiconformal mappings that was developed several decades after
him by Gr{\"o}tzsch, Lavrentieff, Ahlfors and Teichm{\"u}ller. Gr{\"o}tzsch, in his papers,
mentions the work of Tissot, and in some of the drawings he made for his articles, the Tissot indicatrix
is represented. Teichm{\"u}ller mentions the name Tissot in a historical section in one of his fundamental
papers in which he points out that quasiconformal mappings were initially used by geographers.
The name Tissot is missing from all the known historical reports on quasiconformal mappings. In
the present article, we report on this work of Tissot, showing that the theory of quasiconformal
mappings has a practical origin. The final version of this article will appear in Vol. VII of the Handbook
of Teichm{\"u}ller Theory (European Mathematical Society Publishing House, 2020).
