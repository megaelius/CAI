From a mathematical point of view self-organization can be described as patterns to which certain
dynamical systems modeling social dynamics tend spontaneously to be attracted. In this paper we
explore situations beyond self-organization, in particular how to externally control such dynamical
systems in order to eventually enforce pattern formation also in those situations where this wished
phenomenon does not result from spontaneous convergence. Our focus is on dynamical systems of Cucker-Smale
type, modeling consensus emergence, and we question the existence of stabilization and optimal
control strategies which require the minimal amount of external intervention for nevertheless
inducing consensus in a group of interacting agents. We provide a variational criterion to explicitly
design feedback controls that are componentwise sparse, i.e. with at most one nonzero component
at every instant of time. Controls sharing this sparsity feature are very realistic and convenient
for practical issues. Moreover, the maximally sparse ones are instantaneously optimal in terms
of the decay rate of a suitably designed Lyapunov functional, measuring the distance from consensus.
As a consequence we provide a mathematical justification to the general principle according to
which "sparse is better" in the sense that a policy maker, who is not allowed to predict future developments,
should always consider more favorable to intervene with stronger action on the fewest possible
instantaneous optimal leaders rather than trying to control more agents with minor strength in
order to achieve group consensus. We then establish local and global sparse controllability properties
to consensus and, finally, we analyze the sparsity of solutions of the finite time optimal control
problem where the minimization criterion is a combination of the distance from consensus and of
the l1-norm of the control.
