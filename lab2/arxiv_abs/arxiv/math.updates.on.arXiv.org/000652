Consider $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $M$ local coordinate systems that are related through
unknown rigid transforms. For each point we are given (possibly noisy) measurements of its local
coordinates in some of the coordinate systems. Alternatively, for each coordinate system, we observe
the coordinates of a subset of the points. The problem of estimating the global coordinates of the
$N$ points (up to a rigid transform) from such measurements comes up in distributed approaches to
molecular conformation and sensor network localization, and also in computer vision and graphics.
The least-squares formulation of this problem, though non-convex, has a well known closed-form
solution when $M=2$ (based on the singular value decomposition). However, no closed form solution
is known for $M\geq 3$. In this paper, we demonstrate how the least-squares formulation can be relaxed
into a convex program, namely a semidefinite program (SDP). By setting up connections between the
uniqueness of this SDP and results from rigidity theory, we prove conditions for exact and stable
recovery for the SDP relaxation. In particular, we prove that the SDP relaxation can guarantee recovery
under more adversarial conditions compared to earlier proposed spectral relaxations, and derive
error bounds for the registration error incurred by the SDP relaxation. We also present results
of numerical experiments on simulated data to confirm the theoretical findings. We empirically
demonstrate that (a) unlike the spectral relaxation, the relaxation gap is mostly zero for the semidefinite
program (i.e., we are able to solve the original non-convex least-squares problem) up to a certain
noise threshold, and (b) the semidefinite program performs significantly better than spectral
and manifold-optimization methods, particularly at large noise levels.
