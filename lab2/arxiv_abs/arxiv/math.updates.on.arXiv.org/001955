In this paper, we employ successive convexification to solve the minimum-time 6-DoF rocket powered
landing problem. The contribution of this paper is the development and demonstration of a free-final-time
problem formulation that can be solved iteratively using a successive convexification framework.
This paper is an extension of our previous work on the 3-DoF free-final-time and the 6-DoF fixed-final-time
minimum-fuel problems. Herein, the vehicle is modeled as a 6-DoF rigid-body controlled by a single
gimbaled rocket engine. The trajectory is subject to a variety of convex and non-convex state- and
control-constraints, and aerodynamic effects are assumed negligible. The objective of the problem
is to determine the optimal thrust commands that will minimize the time-of-flight while satisfying
the aforementioned constraints. Solving this problem quickly and reliably is challenging because
(a) it is nonlinear and non-convex, (b) the validity of the solution is heavily dependent on the accuracy
of the discretization scheme, and (c) it can be difficult to select a suitable reference trajectory
to initialize an iterative solution process. To deal with these issues, our algorithm (a) uses successive
convexification to eliminate non-convexities, (b) computes the discrete linear-time-variant
system matrices to ensure that the converged solution perfectly satisfies the original nonlinear
dynamics, and (c) can be initialized with a simple, dynamically inconsistent reference trajectory.
Using the proposed convex formulation and successive convexification framework, we are able to
convert the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex second-order cone programming
(SOCP) sub-problems. Through the use of Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers, this sequence can
be solved quickly and reliably, thus enabling higher fidelity real-time guidance for rocket powered
landings on Mars.
