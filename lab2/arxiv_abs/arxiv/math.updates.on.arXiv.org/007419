In aerospace engineering and boat building, fluid-structure interaction models are considered
to investigate prototypes before they are physically assembled. How a material interacts with
different fluids at different Reynold numbers has to be studied before it is passed over to the manufacturing
process. In addition, examining the same model not only for different fluids but also for different
solids allows to optimize the choice of materials for construction even better. A possible answer
on this demand is parameter-dependent discretization. Furthermore, low-rank techniques can
reduce the complexity needed to compute approximations to parameter-dependent fluid-structure
interaction discretizations. Low-rank methods have been applied to parameter-dependent linear
fluid-structure interaction discretizations. The linearity of the operators involved allows
to translate the resulting equations to a single matrix equation. The solution is approximated
by a low-rank method. In this paper, we propose a new method that extends this framework to nonlinear
parameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction problems by means of the Newton iteration.
The parameter set is split into disjoint subsets. On each subset, the Newton approximation of the
problem related to the upper median parameter is computed and serves as initial guess for one Newton
step on the whole subset. This Newton step yields a matrix equation whose solution can be approximated
by a low-rank method. The resulting method requires a smaller number of Newton steps if compared
with a direct approach that applies the Newton iteration to the separate problems consecutively.
In the experiments considered, the proposed method allowed to compute a low-rank approximation
within a twentieth of the time used by the direct approach.
