This paper considers a general Gaussian relay network where a source transmits a message to a destination
with the help of N half-duplex relays. It proves that the information theoretic cut-set upper bound
to the capacity can be achieved to within (N + 2) = 2 log(4(N + 2)) bits with noisy network coding, thereby
reducing the previously known gap. It further decreases the gap for more structured relay systems
such as diamond networks. It is then shown that the generalized Degrees-of-Freedom of a general
Gaussian half-duplex relay network is the solution of a linear program, where the coefficients
of the linear inequality constraints can be obtained by solving several linear programs, known
in graph theory as the assignment problem, for which efficient numerical algorithms exist. The
optimal schedule, that is, the optimal value of the 2N possible listen-receive configurations/states
for the relays, is investigated and known results for diamond networks are extended to general relay
networks. It is shown, for the case of 2 relays, that only 3 out of the 4 possible states have strictly
positive probability. Extensive experimental results show that, for a general N-relay network
with N < 9, the optimal schedule has at most N + 1 states with strictly positive probability. As
an extension of a conjecture presented for diamond networks, it is conjectured that this result
holds for any HD relay network and any number of relays. Finally, a 2-relay network is studied to determine
the channel conditions under which selecting the best relay is not optimal, and to highlight the
nature of the rate gain due to multiple relays.
