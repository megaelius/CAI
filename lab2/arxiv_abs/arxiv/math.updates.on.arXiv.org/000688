We consider a generic configuration of regions, consisting of a collection of distinct compact
regions $\{\Omega_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ which may be either smooth regions disjoint from
the others or regions which meet on their piecewise smooth boundaries $\mathcal{B}_i$ in a generic
way. We introduce a skeletal linking structure for the collection of regions which simultaneously
captures the regions' individual shapes and geometric properties as well as the "positional geometry"
of the collection. The linking structure extends in a minimal way the individual "skeletal structures"
on each of the regions, allowing us to significantly extend the mathematical methods introduced
for single regions to the configuration. We prove for a generic configuration of regions the existence
of a special type of Blum linking structure which builds upon the Blum medial axes of the individual
regions. This requires proving several transversality theorems for certain associated "multi-distance"
and "height-distance" functions for such configurations. We show that by relaxing the conditions
on the Blum linking structures we obtain the more general class of skeletal linking structures which
still capture the geometric properties. In addition to yielding geometric invariants which capture
the shapes and geometry of individual regions, the linking structures are used to define invariants
which measure positional properties of the configuration such as: measures of relative closeness
of neighboring regions and relative significance of the individual regions for the configuration.
These invariants, which are computed by formulas involving "skeletal linking integrals" on the
internal skeletal structures, are then used to construct a "tiered linking graph," which identifies
subconfigurations and provides a hierarchical ordering of the regions.
