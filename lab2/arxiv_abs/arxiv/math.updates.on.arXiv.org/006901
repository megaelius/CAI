We consider models of growing random trees $\{\mathcal{T}_f(n):n\geq 1\}$ with model dynamics
driven by an attachment function $f:\mathbb{Z}_+\to \mathbb{R}_+$. At each stage a new vertex
enters the system and connects to a vertex $v$ in the current tree with probability proportional
to $f(\text{degree}(v))$. The main goal of this study is to understand the performance of root finding
algorithms. A large body of work (e.g. the work of Bubeck, Devroye and Lugosi or Jog and Loh) has emerged
in the last few years in using techniques based on the Jordan centrality measure and its variants
to develop root finding algorithms. Given an unlabelled unrooted tree, one computes the Jordan
centrality for each vertex in the tree and for a fixed budget $K$ outputs the optimal $K$ vertices
(as measured by Jordan centrality). Under general conditions on the attachment function $f$, we
derive necessary and sufficient bounds on the budget $K(\epsilon)$ in order to recover the root
with probability at least $1-\epsilon$. For canonical examples such as linear preferential attachment
and uniform attachment, these general results give matching upper and lower bounds for the budget.
We also prove persistence of the optimal $K$ Jordan centers for any $K$, i.e. the existence of an almost
surely finite random time $n^*$ such that for $n \geq n^*$ the identity of the $K$-optimal Jordan
centers in $\{\mathcal{T}_f(n):n\geq n^*\}$ does not change, thus describing robustness properties
of this measure. Key technical ingredients in the proofs of independent interest include sufficient
conditions for the existence of exponential moments for limits of (appropriately normalized)
continuous time branching processes within which the models $\{\mathcal{T}_f(n):n\geq n^*\}$
can be embedded, as well as rates of convergence results to these limits.
