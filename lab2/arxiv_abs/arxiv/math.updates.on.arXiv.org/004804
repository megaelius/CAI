We consider a team of heterogeneous agents that is collectively responsible for servicing and subsequently
reviewing a stream of homogeneous tasks. Each agent (autonomous system or human operator) has an
associated mean service time and mean review time for servicing and reviewing the tasks, respectively,
which are based on their expertise and skill-sets. Agents receive a utility based on the rates at
which they service and review the tasks. The team objective is to collaboratively maximize the number
of serviced and reviewed tasks. However, without appropriate incentives, collaborating with
other team-members is sub-optimal for each agent as it may reduce their own utility. To this end,
we formulate a Common-Pool Resource (CPR) game and design utility functions to incentivize collaboration
among heterogeneous team-members in a decentralized manner. We show the existence and uniqueness
of the Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) for the CPR game. We characterize the structure of the PNE and study
the effect of heterogeneity among agents. In particular, we show that at PNE, the review rate of agents
decreases with increasing ratio of mean review time and mean service time, i.e., the agents which
are better in reviewing the tasks than servicing the tasks, review the tasks at higher review rates
as compared to the agents which are better in servicing of tasks than reviewing them. We show that
the CPR game is a best response potential game for which both sequential best response dynamics and
simultaneous best reply dynamics converge to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we numerically illustrate
the price of anarchy and other measures of inefficiency for the PNE.
