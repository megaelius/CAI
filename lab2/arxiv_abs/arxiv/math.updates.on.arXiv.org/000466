We study a birational equivalence associated to any finite poset P. This equivalence is a far-reaching
generalization (found by Einstein and Propp) of classical rowmotion, which is a certain permutation
of the set of order ideals of P. Classical rowmotion has been studied by various authors (Fon-der-Flaass,
Cameron, Brouwer, Schrijver, Striker, Williams and many more) under different guises (Striker-Williams
promotion and Panyushev complementation are two examples of maps equivalent to it). In contrast,
birational rowmotion is new and has yet to reveal several of its mysteries. In this paper, we prove
that birational rowmotion has order p+q on the (p, q)-rectangle poset (i. e., on the product of a p-element
chain with a q-element chain); we furthermore compute its orders on some triangle-shaped posets
and on a class of posets which we call "skeletal" (this class includes all graded forests). In all
cases mentioned, birational rowmotion turns out to have a finite (and explicitly computable) order,
a property it does not exhibit for general finite posets (unlike classical rowmotion, which is a
permutation of a finite set). Our proof in the case of the rectangle poset uses the approach introduced
by Volkov (arXiv:0606094) to prove the AA case of the Zamolodchikov periodicity conjecture; in
fact, the finite order of birational rowmotion on many posets can be considered an analogue to Zamolodchikov
periodicity. We comment on suspected, but so far enigmatic, connections to the theory of root posets.
We also make a digression to study classical rowmotion on skeletal posets, since this case has seemingly
been overlooked so far.
