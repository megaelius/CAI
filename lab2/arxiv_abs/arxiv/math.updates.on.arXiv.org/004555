Design optimization of engineering systems with multiple competing objectives is a painstakingly
tedious process especially when the objective functions are expensive-to-evaluate computer
codes with parametric uncertainties. The effectiveness of the state-of-the-art techniques is
greatly diminished because they require a large number of objective evaluations, which makes them
impractical for problems of the above kind. Bayesian global optimization (BGO), has managed to
deal with these challenges in solving single-objective optimization problems and has recently
been extended to multi-objective optimization (MOO). BGO models the objectives via probabilistic
surrogates and uses the epistemic uncertainty to define an information acquisition function (IAF)
that quantifies the merit of evaluating the objective at new designs. This iterative data acquisition
process continues until a stopping criterion is met. The most commonly used IAF for MOO is the expected
improvement over the dominated hypervolume (EIHV) which in its original form is unable to deal with
parametric uncertainties or measurement noise. In this work, we provide a systematic reformulation
of EIHV to deal with stochastic MOO problems. The primary contribution of this paper lies in being
able to filter out the noise and reformulate the EIHV without having to observe or estimate the stochastic
parameters. An addendum of the probabilistic nature of our methodology is that it enables us to characterize
our confidence about the predicted Pareto front. We verify and validate the proposed methodology
by applying it to synthetic test problems with known solutions. We demonstrate our approach on an
industrial problem of die pass design for a steel wire drawing process.
