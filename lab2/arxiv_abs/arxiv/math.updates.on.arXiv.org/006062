We present a numerical approximation of Darcy's flow through a porous medium that incorporates
networks of fractures with non empty intersection. Our scheme employs PolyDG methods, i.e. discontinuous
Galerkin methods on general polygonal and polyhedral (polytopic, for short) grids, featuring
elements with edges/faces that may be in arbitrary number (potentially unlimited) and whose measure
may be arbitrarily small. Our approach is then very well suited to tame the geometrical complexity
featured by most of applications in the computational geoscience field. From the modelling point
of view, we adopt a reduction strategy that treats fractures as manifolds of codimension one and
we employ the primal version of Darcy's law to describe the flow in both the bulk and in the fracture
network. In addition, some physically consistent conditions couple the two problems, allowing
for jump of pressure at their interface, and they as well prescribe the behaviour of the fluid along
the intersections, imposing pressure continuity and flux conservation. Both the bulk and fracture
discretizations are obtained employing the Symmetric Interior Penalty DG method extended to the
polytopic setting. The key instrument to obtain a polyDG approximation of the problem in the fracture
network is the generalization of the concepts of jump and average at the intersection, so that the
contribution from all the fractures is taken into account. We prove the well-posedness of the discrete
formulation and perform an error analysis obtaining a priori hp-error estimates. All our theoretical
results are validated performing preliminary numerical tests with known analytical solution.
