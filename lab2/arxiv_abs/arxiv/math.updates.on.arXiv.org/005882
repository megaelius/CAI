In 1934, in Bernays preface to the 1st edn. of the 1st vol. of Hilbert-Bernays "Grundlagen der Mathematik",
a nearly completed draft of the the finally two-volume monograph is mentioned, which had to be revoked
because of the completely changed situation in the area of proof theory after Herbrand and Goedels
revolutionary results. Nothing at all seems to be known about this draft and its whereabouts. A third
of a century later, Bernays preface to the 2nd edn. (1968) of the 1st vol. of Hilbert-Bernays mentions
joint work of Hasenjaeger and Bernays on the second edition. Bernays states there that this work
was given up because it became obvious that the integration of the many new results in the area of proof
theory would have required a complete reorganization of the book, i.e. that the inclusion of the
intermediately found new results in the area of proof theory turned out to be unobtainable by a revision,
but would have required a complete reorganization of the entire textbook. We document that - even
after the need for a complete reorganization had become obvious - this joint work went on to a considerable
extent. Moreover, we document when Hasenjaeger stayed in Zurich to assist Bernays in the completion
of the 2nd edn. In May 2017, we identified an incorrectly filed text in Bernays scientific legacy
at the archive of the ETH Zurich as a candidate for the beginning of the revoked draft for the 1st edn.
or of a revoked draft for the 2nd edn. In a partial presentation and careful investigation of this
text we gather only some minor evidence that this text is the beginning of the nearly completed draft
of the 1st edn., but ample evidence that this text is part of the work of Hasenjaeger and Bernays on
the 2nd edn. We provide some evidence that this work has covered a complete reorganization of the
entire 1st vol., including a completely new version of its last chapter.
