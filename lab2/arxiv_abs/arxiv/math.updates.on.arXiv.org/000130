Far-field microwave power transfer (MPT) will free wireless sensors and other mobile devices from
the constraints imposed by finite battery capacities. Integrating MPT with wireless communications
to support simultaneous information and power transfer (SIPT) allows the same spectrum to be used
for dual purposes without compromising the quality of service. A novel approach is presented in
this paper for realizing SIPT in a broadband system where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
and transmit beamforming are deployed to create a set of parallel sub-channels for SIPT, which simplifies
resource allocation. Supported by a proposed reconfigurable mobile architecture, different
system configurations are considered by combining single-user/multiuser systems, downlink/uplink
information transfer, and variable/fixed coding rates. Optimizing the power control for these
configurations results in a new class of multiuser power-control problems featuring circuit-power
constraints, specifying that the transferred power must be sufficiently large to support the operation
of the receiver circuitry. Solving these problems gives a set of power-control algorithms that
exploit channel diversity in frequency for simultaneously enhancing the throughput and the MPT
efficiency. For the system configurations with variable coding rates, the algorithms are variants
of water-filling that account for the circuit-power constraints. The optimal algorithms for those
configurations with fixed coding rates are shown to sequentially allocate mobiles their required
power for decoding in the ascending order until the entire budgeted power is spent. The required
power for a mobile is derived as simple functions of the minimum signal-to-noise ratio for correct
decoding, the circuit power and sub-channel gains.
