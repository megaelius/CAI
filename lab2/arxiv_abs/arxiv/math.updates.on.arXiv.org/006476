We consider an online assortment problem with $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ sellers, each holding
exactly one item $i\in[n]$ with initial inventory $c_i\in \mathbb{Z}_+$, and a sequence of homogeneous
buyers arriving over a finite time horizon $t=1,2,\ldots,m$. There is an online platform whose
goal is to offer a subset $S_t\subseteq [n]$ of sellers to the arriving buyer at time $t$ to maximize
the expected revenue derived over the entire horizon while respecting the inventory constraints.
Given an assortment $S_t$ at time $t$, it is assumed that the buyer will select an item from $S_t$ based
on the well-known multinomial logit model, a well-justified choice model from the economic literature.
In this model, the revenue obtained from selling an item $i$ at a given time $t$ critically depends
on the assortment $S_t$ offered at that time and is given by the Nash equilibrium of a Bertrand game
among the sellers in $S_t$. This imposes a strong dependence/externality between the offered assortments,
items revenues, and inventory levels. Despite these challenges, we devise a constant competitive
algorithm for the online assortment problem with homogeneous buyers. This answers a question in
a paper by Zheng and Srikant 2019, that considered the static version of this problem with only one
buyer and no inventory constraints. We then consider this model under an offline setting with heterogeneous
buyers. Under a mild market consistency assumption, we show that the generalized Bertrand game
admits a pure strategy Nash equilibrium over arbitrary buyer-seller bipartite graphs. Finally,
we develop an $O(\ln m)$-approximation algorithm for optimal market segmentation of the generalized
Bertrand game.
