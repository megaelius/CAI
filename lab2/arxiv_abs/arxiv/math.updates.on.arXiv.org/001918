We are concerned with the nodal set of solutions to equations of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta
u = \lambda_+ \left(u^+\right)^{q-1} - \lambda_- \left(u^-\right)^{q-1} \quad \text{in $B_1$}
\end{equation*} where $\lambda_+,\lambda_- > 0$, $q \in [1,2)$, $B_1=B_1(0)$ is the unit ball
in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 2$, and $u^+:= \max\{u,0\}$, $u^-:= \max\{-u,0\}$ are the positive and
the negative part of $u$, respectively. This class includes, the \emph{unstable two-phase membrane
problem} ($q=1$), as well as \emph{sublinear} equations for $1<q<2$. We prove the following main
results: (a) the finiteness of the vanishing order at every point and the complete characterization
of the order spectrum; (b) a weak non-degeneracy property; (c) regularity of the nodal set of any
solution: the nodal set is a locally finite collection of regular codimension one manifolds up to
a residual singular set having Hausdorff dimension at most $N-2$ (locally finite when $N=2$); (d)
a partial stratification theorem. Ultimately, the main features of the nodal set are strictly related
with those of the solutions to linear (or superlinear) equations, with two remarkable differences.
First of all, the admissible vanishing orders can not exceed the critical value $2/(2-q)$. At threshold,
we find a multiplicity of homogeneous solutions, yielding the \emph{non-validity} of any estimate
of the $(N-1)$-dimensional measure of the nodal set of a solution in terms of the vanishing order.
The proofs are based on monotonicity formul\ae \ for a $2$-parameter family of Weiss-type functionals,
blow-up arguments, and the classification of homogenous solutions.
