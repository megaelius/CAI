The non-parametric estimation of covariance lies at the heart of functional data analysis, whether
for curve or surface-valued data. The case of a two-dimensional domain poses both statistical and
computational challenges, which are typically alleviated by assuming separability. However,
separability is often questionable, sometimes even demonstrably inadequate. We propose a framework
for the analysis of covariance operators of random surfaces that generalises separability, while
retaining its major advantages. Our approach is based on the additive decomposition of the covariance
into a series of separable components. The decomposition is valid for any covariance over a two-dimensional
domain. Leveraging the key notion of the partial inner product, we generalise the power iteration
method to general Hilbert spaces and show how the aforementioned decomposition can be efficiently
constructed in practice. Truncation of the decomposition and retention of the principal separable
components automatically induces a non-parametric estimator of the covariance, whose parsimony
is dictated by the truncation level. The resulting estimator can be calculated, stored and manipulated
with little computational overhead relative to separability. The framework and estimation method
are genuinely non-parametric, since the considered decomposition holds for any covariance. Consistency
and rates of convergence are derived under mild regularity assumptions, illustrating the trade-off
between bias and variance regulated by the truncation level. The merits and practical performance
of the proposed methodology are demonstrated in a comprehensive simulation study.
