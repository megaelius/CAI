In this article, we continue our study of 'Frobenius structures' and symplectic spectral invariants
in the context of symplectic spinors. By studying the case of $C^1$-small Hamiltonian mappings
on symplectic manifolds $M$ admitting a metaplectic structure and a parallel $\hat O(n)$-reduction
of its metaplectic frame bundle we derive how the construction of 'singularly rigid' resp. 'self-dual'
pairs of irreducible Frobenius structures associated to this Hamiltonian mapping $\Phi$ leads
to a Hopf-algebra-type structure on the set of irreducible Frobenius structures. We then generalize
this construction and define abstractly conditions under which 'dual pairs' associated to a given
$C^1$-small Hamiltonian mapping emerge, these dual pairs are esssentially pairs $(s_1, J_1),
(s_2, J_2)$ of closed sections of the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ and (in general singular) comptaible
almost complex structures on $M$ satisfying certain integrability conditions involving a Koszul
bracket. In the second part of this paper, we translate these characterizing conditions for general
'dual pairs' of Frobenius structures associated to a $C^1$-small Hamiltonian system into the notion
of matrix factorization. We propose an algebraic setting involving modules over certain fractional
ideals of function rings on $M$ so that the set of 'dual pairs' in the above sense and the set of matrix
factorizations associated to these modules stand in bijective relation. We prove, in the real-analytic
case, a Riemann Roch-type theorem relating a certain Euler characteristic arising from a given
matrix factorization in the above sense to (integral) cohomological data on $M$ using Cheeger-Simons-type
differential characters, derived from a given pair $(s_1, J_1), (s_2, J_2)$. We propose extensions
of these techniques to the case of 'geodesic convexity-smallness' of $\Phi$ and to the case of general
Hamiltonian systems on $M$.
