Rapidly fading channels caused by pedestrians in dense urban environments will have a significant
impact on millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications systems that employ electrically-steerable
and narrow beamwidth antenna arrays. A peer-to-peer (P2P) measurement campaign was conducted
with 7-degree, 15-degree, and 60-degree half-power beamwidth (HPBW) antenna pairs at 73.5 GHz
and with 1 GHz of RF null-to-null bandwidth in a heavily populated open square scenario in Brooklyn,
New York, to study blockage events caused by typical pedestrian traffic. Antenna beamwidths that
range approximately an order of magnitude were selected to gain knowledge of fading events for antennas
with different beamwidths since antenna patterns for mmWave systems will be electronically-adjustable.
Two simple modeling approaches in the literature are introduced to characterize the blockage events
by either a two-state Markov model or a four-state piecewise linear modeling approach. Transition
probability rates are determined from the measurements and it is shown that average fade durations
with a -5 dB threshold are 299.0 ms for 7-degree HPBW antennas and 260.2 ms for 60-degree HPBW antennas.
The four-state piecewise linear modeling approach shows that signal strength decay and rise times
are asymmetric for blockage events and that mean signal attenuations (average fade depths) are
inversely proportional to antenna HPBW, where 7-degree and 60-degree HPBW antennas resulted in
mean signal fades of 15.8 dB and 11.5 dB, respectively. The models presented herein are valuable
for extending statistical channel models at mmWave to accurately simulate real-world pedestrian
blockage events when designing fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems.
