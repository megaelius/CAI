We investigate the impact of modifying the constraining relations of a Constraint Satisfaction
Problem (CSP) instance, with a fixed template, on the set of solutions of the instance. More precisely
we investigate sensitive instances: an instance of the CSP is called sensitive, if removing any
tuple from any constraining relation invalidates some solution of the instance. Equivalently,
one could require that every tuple from any one of its constraints extends to a solution of the instance.
Clearly, any non-trivial template has instances which are not sensitive. Therefore we follow the
direction proposed (in the context of strict width) by Feder and Vardi (SICOMP 1999) and require
that only the instances produced by a local consistency checking algorithm are sensitive. In the
language of the algebraic approach to the CSP we show that a finite idempotent algebra $\mathbf{A}$
has a $k+2$ variable near unanimity term operation if and only if any instance that results from running
the $(k, k+1)$-consistency algorithm on an instance over $\mathbf{A}^2$ is sensitive. A version
of our result, without idempotency but with the sensitivity condition holding in a variety of algebras,
settles a question posed by G. Bergman about systems of projections of algebras that arise from some
subalgebra of a finite product of algebras. Our results hold for infinite (albeit in the case of $\mathbf{A}$
idempotent) algebras as well and exhibit a surprising similarity to the strict width $k$ condition
proposed by Feder and Vardi. Both conditions can be characterized by the existence of a near unanimity
operation, but the arities of the operations differ by 1.
