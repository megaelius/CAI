The thesis is devoted to a rigorous construction of the Wightman and Green functions in models of
the perturbative quantum field theory in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the framework
of the causal perturbation theory developed by Epstein and Glaser. In the first part of the thesis
we give an overview of the Epstein-Glaser approach to the perturbative quantum field theory. In
the second part we construct the Wightman and Green functions in a large class of models, generalizing
the result due to Blanchard and Seneor. To this end, we show the existence of the so-called weak adiabatic
limit. The proof of the existence of this limit is valid under the assumption that the time-ordered
products satisfy certain normalization condition. We show that this normalization condition
may be imposed in all models with interaction vertices of the canonical dimension equal to four as
well as in all models with interaction vertices of the canonical dimension equal to three provided
each of them contains at least one massive field. Moreover, we prove that the above-mentioned normalization
condition is compatible with all the standard normalization conditions which are usually imposed
on the time-ordered products. We consider in detail the case of the quantum electrodynamics with
a massive or massless, spinor or scalar charged field and certain model of interacting scalar fields
with the interaction vertex of dimension three which we call the scalar model. Our result is also
applicable to non-abelian Yang-Mills theories. Using the method developed in the proof of the existence
of the weak adiabatic limit, we also show the existence of the central splitting solution in the quantum
electrodynamics with a massive spinor field.
