An approach to building explicit time-marching stencil computation schemes for the transient
2D acoustic wave equation without using finite-difference approximations is proposed and implemented.
It is based on using the integral representation formula (Poisson's formula) that provides the
exact solution of the initial-value problem for the transient 2D scalar wave equation at any time
point through the initial conditions. For the purpose of constructing a two-step time-marching
algorithm, a modified integral representation formula involving three time levels is also employed.
It is shown that integrals in the two representation formulas are exactly calculated if the initial
conditions and the sought solution at each time level as functions of spatial coordinates are approximated
by stencil interpolation polynomials in the neighborhood of any point in a 2D Cartesian grid. As
a result, if a uniform time grid is chosen, the proposed time-marching algorithm consists of two
numerical procedures: 1) the solution calculation at the first time-step through the initial conditions;
2) the solution calculation at the second and next time-steps using a generated two-step numerical
scheme. Three particular explicit stencil schemes (with five, nine and 13 space points) are built
using the proposed approach. Their stability regions are presented. The obtained stencil expressions
are compared with the corresponding finite-difference schemes available in the literature. Their
novelty features are discussed. Simulation results with new and conventional schemes are presented
for two benchmark problems that have exact solutions. It is demonstrated that using the new first
time-step calculation procedure instead of the conventional one can provide a significant improvement
of accuracy even for later time steps.
