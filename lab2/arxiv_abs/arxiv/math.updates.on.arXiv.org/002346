We study random polytopes of the form $[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ defined as convex hulls of independent
identically distributed random points $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with one of the following
densities: $$ f_{d,\beta} (x) = c_{d,\beta} (1-\|x\|^2)^{\beta}, \qquad \|x\| < 1, \quad \text{(beta
distribution)} $$ or $$ \tilde f_{d,\beta} (x) = \tilde{c}_{d,\beta} (1+\|x\|^2)^{-\beta},
\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^d, \quad \text{(beta' distribution)}. $$ This setting also includes the
uniform distribution on the unit sphere and the standard normal distribution as limiting cases.
We derive exact and asymptotic formulae for the expected number of $k$-faces of $[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$
for arbitrary $k\in\{0,1,\ldots,d-1\}$. We prove that for any such $k$ this expected number is
strictly monotonically increasing with $n$. Also, we compute the expected internal and external
angles of these polytopes at faces of every dimension and, more generally, the expected conic intrinsic
volumes of their tangent cones. By passing to the large $n$ limit in the beta' case, we compute the
expected $f$-vector of the convex hull of Poisson point processes with power-law intensity function.
Using convex duality, we derive exact formulae for the expected number of $k$-faces of the zero cell
for a class of isotropic Poisson hyperplane tessellation in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This family includes
the zero cell of a classical stationary and an isotropic Poisson hyperplane tessellation and the
typical cell of a stationary Poisson--Voronoi tessellation as special cases. In addition, we prove
precise limit theorems for this $f$-vector in the high-dimensional regime, as $d\to\infty$. Finally,
we relate the $d$-dimensional beta and beta' distributions to the generalized Pareto distributions
known in extreme-value theory.
