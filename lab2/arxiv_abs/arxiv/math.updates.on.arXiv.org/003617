We study amenability of definable groups and topological groups, as well as a new notion of first
order amenability of a theory $T$. Among our main tools, of interest in its own right, is an elaboration
on and strengthening of the Massicot-Wagner version of the stabilizer theorem, and also some results
about measures and measure-like functions. As an application, we show that if $G$ is an amenable
topological group, then the Bohr compactification of $G$ coincides with a certain "weak Bohr compactification"
introduced in [27]. In other words, the conclusion says that certain connected components of $G$
coincide. We also prove wide generalizations of this result, implying in particular its extension
to a "definable-topological" context, confirming the main conjectures from [27]. We study the
relationship between definability of an action of a definable group on a compact space, weakly almost
periodic actions of $G$, and stability. We conclude that for every group $G$ definable in a sufficiently
saturated structure, any definable action of $G$ on a compact space supports a $G$-invariant probability
measure, which answers negatively some questions and conjectures raised in [23] and [27]. We introduce
the notion of first order [extreme] amenability, as a property of a first order theory $T$: every
complete type over $\emptyset$ extends to an invariant global Keisler measure [type]. [Extreme]
amenability of $T$ will follow from [extreme] amenability of the (topological) group $\mbox{Aut}(M)$
for all sufficiently large $\aleph_{0}$-homogeneous countable models $M$ of $T$ (assuming $T$
to be countable), but is radically less restrictive. A further adaptation of the technical tools
mentioned above is used to prove that if $T$ is amenable, then $T$ is G-compact. This extends and essentially
generalizes results in [27].
