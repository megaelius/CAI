Irreversible evolution is one of the central concepts as well as implementation challenges of both
the variational approach to fracture by Francfort and Marigo (1998) and its regularized counterpart
by Bourdin, Francfort and Marigo (2000, 2007 and 2008), which is commonly referred to as a phase-field
model of brittle fracture. Irreversibility of the crack phase-field imposed to prevent fracture
healing leads to a constrained minimization problem, whose optimality condition is given by a variational
{\em inequality}. In our study, the irreversibility is handled via penalization. Provided the
penalty constant is well-tuned, the penalized formulation is a good approximation to the original
one, with the advantage that the induced {\em equality}-based weak problem enables a much simpler
algorithmic treatment. We propose an analytical procedure for deriving the {\em optimal} penalty
constant, more precisely, its {\em lower bound}, which guarantees a sufficiently accurate enforcement
of the crack phase-field irreversibility. Our main tool is the notion of the optimal phase-field
profile, as well as the $\Gamma$-convergence result. It is shown that the explicit lower bound is
a function of two formulation parameters (the fracture toughness and the regularization length
scale) but is independent on the problem setup (geometry, boundary conditions etc.) and the formulation
ingredients (degradation function, tension-compression split etc.). The optimally-penalized
formulation is tested for two benchmark problems, including one with available analytical solution.
We also compare our results with those obtained by using the alternative irreversibility technique
based on the notion of the history field by Miehe et al.\ (2010).
