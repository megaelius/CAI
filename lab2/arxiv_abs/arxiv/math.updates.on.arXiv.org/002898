We give a topological classification of quantum walks on an infinite 1D lattice, which obey one of
the discrete symmetry groups of the tenfold way, have a gap around some eigenvalues at symmetry protected
points, and satisfy a mild locality condition. No translation invariance is assumed. The classification
is parameterized by three indices, taking values in a group, which is either trivial, the group of
integers, or the group of integers modulo 2, depending on the type of symmetry. The classification
is complete in the sense that two walks have the same indices if and only if they can be connected by
a norm continuous path along which all the mentioned properties remain valid. Of the three indices,
two are related to the asymptotic behaviour far to the right and far to the left, respectively. These
are also stable under compact perturbations. The third index is sensitive to those compact perturbations
which cannot be contracted to a trivial one. The results apply to the Hamiltonian case as well. In
this case all compact perturbations can be contracted, so the third index is not defined. Our classification
extends the one known in the translation invariant case, where the asymptotic right and left indices
add up to zero, and the third one vanishes, leaving effectively only one independent index. When
two translationally invariant bulks with distinct indices are joined, the left and right asymptotic
indices of the joined walk are thereby fixed, and there must be eigenvalues at $1$ or $-1$ (bulk-boundary
correspondence). Their location is governed by the third index. We also discuss how the theory applies
to finite lattices, with suitable homogeneity assumptions.
