Millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands will play an important role in 5G wireless systems. The system performance
can be assessed by using models from stochastic geometry that cater for the directivity in the desired
signal transmissions as well as the interference, and by calculating the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) coverage. Nonetheless, the correctness of the existing coverage expressions derived
through stochastic geometry may be questioned, as it is not clear whether they capture the impact
of the detailed mmWave channel and antenna features. In this study, we propose an SINR coverage analysis
framework that includes realistic channel model (from NYU) and antenna element radiation patterns
(with isotropic/directional radiation). We first introduce two parameters, aligned gain and
misaligned gain, associated with the desired signal beam and the interfering signal beam, respectively.
We provide the distributions of the aligned and misaligned gains through curve fitting of system-simulation
results. The distribution of these gains is used to determine the distribution of the SINR. We compare
the obtained analytical SINR coverage with the corresponding SINR coverage calculated via system-level
simulations. The results show that both aligned and misaligned gains can be modeled as exponential-logarithmically
distributed random variables with the highest accuracy, and can further be approximated as exponentially
distributed random variables with reasonable accuracy. These approximations are thus expected
to be useful to evaluate the system performance under ultra-reliable and low-latency communication
(URLLC) and evolved mobile broadband (eMBB) scenarios, respectively.
