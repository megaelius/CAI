Quadratic programming (QP) is a well-studied fundamental NP-hard optimization problem which
optimizes a quadratic objective over a set of linear constraints. In this paper, we reformulate
QPs as a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP). This is done via the reformulation of QP as a linear
complementary problem, and the use of binary variables and big-M constraints, to model the complementary
constraints. To obtain such reformulation, we show how to impose bounds on the dual variables without
eliminating all the (globally) optimal primal solutions; using some fundamental results on the
solution of perturbed linear systems. Reformulating non-convex QPs as MILPs provides an advantageous
way to obtain global solutions as it allows the use of current state-of-the-art MILP solvers. To
illustrate this, we compare the performance of our solution approach, labeled quadprogIP, with
the current benchmark global QP solver quadprogBB, as well as with BARON, one of the leading non-linear
programming (NLP) solvers, and CPLEX's non-convex QP solver, on a large variety of QP test instances.
In practice, quadprogIP is shown to typically outperform by orders of magnitude quadprogBB, BARON,
and CPLEX on standard QPs. For general QPs, quadprogIP outperforms quadprogBB, outperforms BARON
in most instances, while CPLEX performs the best on these instances. For box-constrained QPs, quadprogIP
has a comparable performance to quadprogBB and BARON in small- to medium-scale instances, but is
outperformed by these solvers on large-scale instances; while CPLEX performs the best on box-constrained
QP instances. Also, unlike quadprogBB, the solution approach proposed here is able to solve QP instances
whose dual feasible set is unbounded. The MATLAB code, called quadprogIP, and the instances used
to perform these numerical experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/xiawei918/quadprogIP.
