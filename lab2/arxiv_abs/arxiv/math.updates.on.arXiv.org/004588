The main result below is Theorem 1.4 that shows an unexpected property of any positive planar measure.
This property goes, on the first glance, against a famous Carleson's counterexample, and against
the obvious geometric property of huge overlap among dyadic rectangles. Lennart Carleson showed
in 1974 that the natural generalization of Carleson measure from one parameter case (disc) to bi-parameter
case (bi-disc) does not work. Sun-Yang A. Chang in 1979 found the necessary and sufficient condition
for the Carleson embedding of bi-harmonic extension into bi-disc. In both works the underlying
measure was Lebesgue measure on bi-torus, and "embedding" measure was a priori arbitrary. Sun-Yang
A. Chang found that to have embedding it is necessary and sufficient for measure to satisfy Chang--Carleson
condition. And as was mentioned above the example of Carleson showed that it is not enough to have
a simple "box" condition on embedding measure. Here we switched the places of two measures involved:
the embedding measure is now the simplest measure, and the initial measure on bi-torus is an arbitrary
measure. Embeddings of Dirichlet space on bi-disc lead to that kind of questions. Papers \cite{AMPS18},
\cite{AHMV18b} have shown that the analog of Chang--Carleson condition is again necessary and
sufficient for embedding. However, a new and unexpected effect is exposed below: for $n=2$ a simple
"box" condition turns out to be equivalent to Chang--Carleson type of condition. This seems to be
a new combinatorial fact about all positive measures on the plane. Also this is the note about what
goes wrong with bi-parameter two weight Carleson embedding theorem: we construct a family of counterexamples
to various statements that hold true in one parameter case.
