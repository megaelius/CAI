In this work we analyze the main properties of the Zariski and maximal spectra of the ring ${\mathcal
S}^r(M)$ of differentiable semialgebraic functions of class ${\mathcal C}^r$ on a semialgebraic
set $M\subset\mathbb{R}^m$. Denote ${\mathcal S}^0(M)$ the ring of semialgebraic functions
on $M$ that admit a continuous extension to an open semialgebraic neighborhood of $M$ in $\text{cl}(M)$.
This ring is the real closure of ${\mathcal S}^r(M)$. If $M$ is locally compact, the ring ${\mathcal
S}^r(M)$ enjoys a Lojasiewicz's Nullstellensatz, which becomes a crucial tool. Despite ${\mathcal
S}^r(M)$ is not real closed for $r\geq1$, the Zariski and maximal spectra of this ring are homeomorphic
to the corresponding ones of the real closed ring ${\mathcal S}^0(M)$. In addition, the quotients
of ${\mathcal S}^r(M)$ by its prime ideals have real closed fields of fractions, so the ring ${\mathcal
S}^r(M)$ is close to be real closed. The missing property is that the sum of two radical ideals needs
not to be a radical ideal. The homeomorphism between the spectra of ${\mathcal S}^r(M)$ and ${\mathcal
S}^0(M)$ guarantee that all the properties of these rings that arise from spectra are the same for
both rings. For instance, the ring ${\mathcal S}^r(M)$ is a Gelfand ring and its Krull dimension
is equal to $\dim(M)$. We also show similar properties for the ring ${\mathcal S}^{r*}(M)$ of differentiable
bounded semialgebraic functions. In addition, we confront the ring ${\mathcal S}^{\infty}(M)$
of differentiable semialgebraic functions of class ${\mathcal C}^{\infty}$ with the ring ${\mathcal
N}(M)$ of Nash functions on $M$.
