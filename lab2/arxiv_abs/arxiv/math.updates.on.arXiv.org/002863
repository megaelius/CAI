A strong $\ell$-ification of a matrix polynomial $P(\lambda)=\sum A_i\lambda^i$ of degree $d$
is a matrix polynomial $\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$ of degree $\ell$ having the same finite and infinite
elementary divisors, and the same numbers of left and right minimal indices as $P(\lambda)$. Strong
$\ell$-ifications can be used to transform the polynomial eigenvalue problem associated with
$P(\lambda)$ into an equivalent polynomial eigenvalue problem associated with a larger matrix
polynomial $\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$ of lower degree. Typically $\ell=1$ and, in this case, $\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$
receives the name of strong linearization. However, there exist some situations, e.g., the preservation
of algebraic structures, in which it is more convenient to replace strong linearizations by other
low degree matrix polynomials. In this work, we investigate the eigenvalue conditioning of $\ell$-ifications
from a family of matrix polynomials recently identified and studied by Dopico, P\'erez and Van Dooren,
the so-called block Kronecker companion forms. We compare the conditioning of these $\ell$-ifications
with that of the matrix polynomial $P(\lambda)$, and show that they are about as well conditioned
as the original polynomial, provided we scale $P(\lambda)$ so that $\max\{\|A_i\|_2\}=1$, and
the quantity $\min\{\|A_0\|_2,\|A_d\|_2\}$ is not too small. Moreover, under the scaling assumption
$\max\{\|A_i\|_2\}=1$, we show that any block Kronecker companion form, regardless of its degree
or block structure, is about as well-conditioned as the well-known Frobenius companion forms.
Our theory is illustrated by numerical examples.
