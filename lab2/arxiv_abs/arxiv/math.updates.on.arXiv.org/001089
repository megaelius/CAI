We develop geometry of algebraic subvarieties of $K^{n}$ over arbitrary Henselian valued fields
$K$ of equicharacteristic zero. This is a continuation of our previous article, devoted to algebraic
geometry over rank one valued fields, which in general requires more involved techniques and to
some extent new treatment. Again, at the center of our approach is the closedness theorem that the
projections $K^{n} \times \mathbb{P}^{m}(K) \to K^{n}$ are definably closed maps. Hence we obtain,
in particular, a descent property for blow-ups, which enables application of resolution of singularities
in much the same way as over the locally compact ground field. As before, the proof of that theorem
uses i.a. the local behaviour of definable functions of one variable and fiber shrinking, a relaxed
version of curve selection. But now, to achieve the former result, we first examine functions given
by algebraic power series. All the results from our previous article will be established in the general
settings: several versions of curve selection (via resolution of singularities) and of the \L{}ojasiewicz
inequality (via two instances of quantifier elimination indicated below), extending continuous
hereditarily rational functions and the theory of regulous functions, sets and sheaves, including
Nullstellensatz and Cartan's theorems A and B. Two basic tools applied in this paper are quantifier
elimination for Henselian valued fields due to Pas and relative quantifier elimination for ordered
abelian groups (in a many-sorted language with imaginary auxiliary sorts) due to Cluckers--Halupczok.
Other, new applications of the closedness theorem are piecewise continuity of definable functions
and H\"{o}lder continuity of definable functions on closed bounded subsets of $K^{n}$.
