Manifold learning techniques seek to discover structure-preserving mappings of high-dimensional
data into low-dimensional spaces. While the new sets of coordinates specified by these mappings
can closely parameterize the data, they are generally complicated nonlinear functions of the original
variables. This makes them difficult to interpret physically. Furthermore, in data-driven model
reduction applications the governing equations may have structure that is destroyed by nonlinear
mapping into coordinates on an inertial manifold, creating a computational bottleneck for simulations.
Instead, we propose to identify a small collection of the original variables which are capable of
uniquely determining all others either locally via immersion or globally via embedding of the underlying
manifold. When the data lies on a low-dimensional subspace the existing discrete empirical interpolation
method (DEIM) accomplishes this with recent variants employing greedy algorithms based on pivoted
QR (PQR) factorizations. However, low-dimensional manifolds coming from a variety of applications,
particularly from advection-dominated PDEs, do not lie in or near any low-dimensional subspace.
Our proposed approach extends DEIM to data lying near nonlinear manifolds by applying a similar
pivoted QR procedure simultaneously on collections of patches making up locally linear approximations
of the manifold, resulting in a novel simultaneously pivoted QR (SimPQR) algorithm. The immersion
provided by SimPQR can be extended to an embedding by applying SimPQR a second time to a modified collection
of vectors. The SimPQR method for computing these `nonlinear DEIM' (NLDEIM) coordinates is successfully
applied to real-world data lying near an inertial manifold in a cylinder wake flow as well as data
coming from a viscous Burgers equation with different initial conditions.
