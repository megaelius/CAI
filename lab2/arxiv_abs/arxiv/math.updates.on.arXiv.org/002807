The nested Kingman coalescent describes the dynamics of particles (called genes) contained in
larger components (called species), where pairs of species coalesce at constant rate and pairs
of genes coalesce at constant rate provided they lie within the same species. We prove that starting
from $rn$ species, the empirical distribution of species masses (numbers of genes$/n$) at time
$t/n$ converges as $n\to\infty$ to a solution of the deterministic coagulation-transport equation
$$ \partial_t d \ = \ \partial_x ( \psi d ) \ + \ a(t)\left(d\star d - d \right), $$ where $\psi(x) = cx^2$,
$\star$ denotes convolution and $a(t)= 1/(t+\delta)$ with $\delta=2/r$. The most interesting
case when $\delta =0$ corresponds to an infinite initial number of species. This equation describes
the evolution of the distribution of species of mass $x$, where pairs of species can coalesce and
each species' mass evolves like $\dot x = -\psi(x)$. We provide two natural probabilistic solutions
of the latter IPDE and address in detail the case when $\delta=0$. The first solution is expressed
in terms of a branching particle system where particles carry masses behaving as independent continuous-state
branching processes. The second one is the law of the solution to the following McKean-Vlasov equation
$$ dx_t \ = \ - \psi(x_t) \,dt \ + \ v_t\,\Delta J_t $$ where $J$ is an inhomogeneous Poisson process
with rate $1/(t+\delta)$ and $(v_t; t\geq0)$ is a sequence of independent rvs such that $ {\mathcal
L}(v_t) = {\mathcal L}(x_t)$. We show that there is a unique solution to this equation and we construct
this solution with the help of a marked Brownian coalescent point process. When $\psi(x)=x^\gamma$,
we show the existence of a self-similar solution for the PDE which relates when $\gamma=2$ to the
speed of coming down from infinity of the nested Kingman coalescent.
