We consider leader-follower multi-agent systems that have many leaders, defined on any connected
weighted undirected graphs, and address the leader selection and demotion problems. The leader
selection problem is formulated as a minimization problem for the $H^2$ norm of the difference between
the transfer functions of the original and new agent systems, under the assumption that the leader
agents to be demoted are fixed. The leader demotion problem is that of finding optimal leader agents
to be demoted, and is formulated using the global optimal solution to the leader selection problem.
We prove that a global optimal solution to the leader selection problem is the set of the original
leader agents except for those that are demoted to followers. To this end, we relax the original problem
into a differentiable problem. Then, by calculating the gradient and Hessian of the objective function
of the relaxed problem, we prove that the function is convex. It is shown that zero points of the gradient
are global optimal solutions to the leader selection problem, which is a finite combinatorial optimization
problem. Furthermore, we prove that any set of leader agents to be demoted subject to a fixed number
of elements is a solution to the leader demotion problem. By combining the solutions to the leader
selection and demotion problems, we prove that if we choose new leader agents from the original ones
except for those specified by the set of leader agents to be demoted, then the relative $H^2$ error
between the transfer functions of the original and new agent systems is completely determined by
the numbers of original leader agents and leader agents that are demoted to follower agents. That
is, we reveal that the relative $H^2$ error does not depend on the number of agents on the graph. Finally,
we verify the solutions using a simple example.
