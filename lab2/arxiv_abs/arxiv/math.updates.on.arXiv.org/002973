Let $p(\cdot)$ be a measurable function (a variable exponent) defined on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal
F, \mathbb P;(\mathcal F_n)_{n\geq0})$ satisfying $0<p_-:={\rm ess}\inf_{x\in \Omega}p(x)\leq
{\rm ess}\sup_{x\in\Omega}p(x)=:p_+<\infty$. In this paper, we give a systematic study of martingale
Hardy spaces $H_{p(\cdot)}$ and $H_{p(\cdot),q}$ associated with variable exponent $p(\cdot)$.
The main results of this paper include: (1) The real interpolation is obtained via establishing
$(p(\cdot),\infty)$-atomic decompositions of variable martingale Hardy-Lorentz space $H_{p(\cdot),q}$,
$0<q\leq\infty.$ For $0<\theta<1,$ $$\big(H_{p(\cdot)}, H_{\infty}\big)_{\theta,q}=H_{p_\theta(\cdot),q},
\quad \frac{1}{p_\theta(\cdot)}=\frac{1-\theta}{p(\cdot)}.$$ Compared with real interpolation
with variable exponents in harmonic analysis, our results hardly request any condition on $p(\cdot).$
This demonstrates an important difference between martingale theory and harmonic analysis. (2)
The simple atomic decompositions of $H_{p(\cdot)}$ and $H_{p(\cdot),q}$ are investigated when
$\mathcal F_n$ is generated by countably many atoms for every $n\geq0$. This atomic decomposition
has the advantage to investigate martingale inequalities, dual spaces and John-Nirenberg theorems.
In order to get these results, we introduce the following condition to replace the so-called log-H\"{o}lder
continuous condition in harmonic analysis: $$\mathbb P(A)^{p_-(A)-p_+(A)}\leq C_{p(\cdot)},
\quad\forall A \mbox{ is an atom}.$$ (3) Let $p(\cdot)$ be as above. Some applications in Fourier
analysis are given by use of the previous results. The boundedness of the maximal Fej{\'e}r operator
on $H_{p(\cdot)}$ and $H_{p(\cdot),q}$ is proved. The key point is that we introduce two new dyadic
maximal operators. The method we use to prove these results is new even in the classical case.
