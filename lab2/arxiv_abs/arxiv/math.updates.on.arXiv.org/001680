In this work we show the superiority, in terms of computational efficiency, of the high-degree $k$-method
with respect to low-degree isogeometric discretizations. The $k$-method is the isogeometric
method based on splines (or NURBS, etc.) with maximum regularity. When it is used as a classical finite
element method, increasing the degree becomes soon prohibitive and, in practice, quadratic $C^1$
approximation is the most efficient choice. Recent works have proposed alternative approaches
and significant improvements, still without reaching the $k$-method full efficiency. With our
innovative implementation, increasing the spline degree and regularity (i.e., the $k$-refinement)
significantly improves not only the accuracy, which is known, but also the accuracy-to-computation-time
ratio. The novelty is a matrix-free strategy, which is first used in this context but is well-known
for other high-order methods. Matrix-free implementation speeds up matrix operations, and, perhaps
even more important, greatly reduces memory consumption. Our strategy employs the recently proposed
weighted quadrature, which is an ad-hoc strategy to compute the integrals of the Galerkin system.
The other key ingredient is a preconditioner based on the Fast Diagonalization method, an old idea
to solve Sylvester-like equations. Our numerical tests show that the new implementation is faster
than the standard one (where the main cost is the matrix formation by standard Gaussian quadrature)
even for low degree. But the main point is that, with the new approach, the $k$-method gets orders
of magnitude faster by increasing the degree, given a target accuracy. What we present is applicable
to more complex and realistic differential problems, but its effectiveness will depend on the preconditioner
stage, which is as always problem-dependent.
