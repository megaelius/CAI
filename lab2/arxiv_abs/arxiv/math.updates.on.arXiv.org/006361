In the present paper we find generators of the mixed commutator subgroups of relative elementary
groups and obtain unrelativised versions of commutator formulas in the setting of Bak's unitary
groups. It is a direct sequel of our similar results were obtained for $GL(n,R)$ and for Chevalley
groups over a commutative ring with 1, respectively. Namely, let $(A,\Lambda)$ be any form ring
and $n\ge 3$. We consider Bak's hyperbolic unitary group $GU(2n,A,\Lambda)$. Further, let $(I,\Gamma)$
be a form ideal of $(A,\Lambda)$. One can associate with $(I,\Gamma)$ the corresponding elementary
subgroup $FU(2n,I,\Gamma)$ and the relative elementary subgroup $EU(2n,I,\Gamma)$ of $GU(2n,A,\Lambda)$.
Let $(J,\Delta)$ be another form ideal of $(A,\Lambda)$. In the present paper we prove an unexpected
result that the non-obvious type of generators for $\big[EU(2n,I,\Gamma),EU(2n,J,\Delta)\big]$,
as constructed in our previous papers with Hazrat, are redundant and can be expressed as products
of the obvious generators, the elementary conjugates $Z_{ij}(ab,c)=T_{ji}(c)T_{ij}(ab)T_{ji}(-c)$
and $Z_{ij}(ba,c)$, and the elementary commutators $Y_{ij}(a,b)=[T_{ji}(a),T_{ij}(b)]$,
where $a\in(I,\Gamma)$, $b\in(J,\Delta)$, $c\in(A,\Lambda)$. It follows that $\big[FU(2n,I,\Gamma),FU(2n,J,\Delta)\big]=
\big[EU(2n,I,\Gamma),EU(2n,J,\Delta)\big]$. In fact, we establish much more precise generation
results. In particular, even the elementary commutators $Y_{ij}(a,b)$ should be taken for one
long root position and one short root position. Moreover, $Y_{ij}(a,b)$ are central modulo $EU(2n,(I,\Gamma)\circ(J,\Delta))$
and behave as symbols. This allows us to generalise and unify many previous results,including the
multiple elementary commutator formula, and dramatically simplify their proofs.
