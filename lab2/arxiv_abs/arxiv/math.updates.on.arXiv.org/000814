This paper proposes a multi-stage projection-based Lasso procedure for the semiparametric sample
selection model in high-dimensional settings under a weak nonparametric restriction on the selection
correction. In particular, the number of regressors in the main equation, p, and the number of regressors
in the selection equation, d, can grow with and exceed the sample size n. The analysis considers the
exact sparsity case and the approximate sparsity case. The main theoretical results are finite-sample
bounds from which sufficient scaling conditions on the sample size for estimation consistency
and variable-selection consistency are established. Statistical efficiency of the proposed
estimators is studied via lower bounds on minimax risks and the result shows that, for a family of
models with exactly sparse structure on the coefficient vector in the main equation, one of the proposed
estimators attains the smallest estimation error up to the (n,d,p)-scaling among a class of procedures
in worst-case scenarios. Inference procedures for the coefficients of the main equation, one based
on a pivotal Dantzig selector to construct non-asymptotic confidence sets and one based on a post-selection
strategy, are discussed. Other theoretical contributions include establishing the non-asymptotic
counterpart of the familiar asymptotic oracle results from previous literature: the estimator
of the coefficients in the main equation behaves as if the unknown nonparametric component were
known, provided the nonparametric component is sufficiently smooth. Small-sample performance
of the high-dimensional multi-stage estimation procedure is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations
and illustrated with an empirical application to the retail gasoline market in the Greater Saint
Louis area.
