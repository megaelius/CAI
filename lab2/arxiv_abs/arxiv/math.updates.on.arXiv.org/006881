We classify and characterize all invertible anomalies and all allowed topological terms related
to various Standard Models (SM), Grand Unified Theories (GUT), and Beyond Standard Model (BSM)
physics. By all anomalies, we mean the inclusion of (1) perturbative/local anomalies captured
by perturbative Feynman diagram loop calculations, classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ free classes,
and (2) non-perturbative/global anomalies, classified by finite group $\mathbb{Z}_N$ torsion
classes. Our work built from [arXiv:1812.11967] fuses the math tools of Adams spectral sequence,
Thom-Madsen-Tillmann spectra, and Freed-Hopkins theorem. For example, we compute bordism groups
$\Omega^{G}_d$ and their invertible topological field theory invariants, which characterize
$d$d topological terms and $(d-1)$d anomalies, protected by the following symmetry group $G$:
$Spin\times \frac{SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)}{\mathbb{Z}_q}$ for SM with $q=1,2,3,6$; $\frac{Spin
\times Spin(n)}{\mathbb{Z}_2^F}$ or $Spin \times Spin(n)$ for SO(10) or SO(18) GUT as $n=10, 18$;
$Spin \times SU(n)$ for Georgi-Glashow SU(5) GUT as $n=5$; $\frac{Spin\times \frac{SU(4)\times(SU(2)\times
SU(2))}{\mathbb{Z}_{q'}}}{\mathbb{Z}_2^F}$ for Pati-Salam GUT as $q'=1,2$; and others. For
SM with an extra discrete symmetry, we obtain new anomaly matching conditions of $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$,
$\mathbb{Z}_{4}$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ classes in 4d beyond the familiar Witten anomaly. Our
approach offers an alternative view of all anomaly matching conditions built from the lower-energy
(B)SM or GUT, in contrast to high-energy Quantum Gravity or String Theory Landscape v.s. Swampland
program, as bottom-up/top-down complements. Symmetries and anomalies provide constraints of
kinematics, we further suggest constraints of quantum gauge dynamics, and new predictions of possible
extended defects/excitations plus hidden BSM non-perturbative topological sectors.
