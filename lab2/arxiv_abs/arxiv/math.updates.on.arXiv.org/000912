The increase in network connectivity has also resulted in several high-profile attacks on cyber-physical
systems. An attacker that manages to access a local network could remotely affect control performance
by tampering with sensor measurements delivered to the controller. Recent results have shown that
with network-based attacks, such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks, the attacker can introduce an
unbounded state estimation error if measurements from a suitable subset of sensors contain false
data when delivered to the controller. While these attacks can be addressed with the standard cryptographic
tools that ensure data integrity, their continuous use would introduce significant communication
and computation overhead. Consequently, we study effects of intermittent data integrity guarantees
on system performance under stealthy attacks. We consider linear estimators equipped with a general
type of residual-based intrusion detectors (including $\chi^2$ and SPRT detectors), and show
that even when integrity of sensor measurements is enforced only intermittently, the attack impact
is significantly limited; specifically, the state estimation error is bounded or the attacker
cannot remain stealthy. Furthermore, we present methods to: (1) evaluate the effects of any given
integrity enforcement policy in terms of reachable state-estimation errors for any type of stealthy
attacks, and (2) design an enforcement policy that provides the desired estimation error guarantees
under attack. Finally, on three automotive case studies we show that even with less than 10% of authenticated
messages we can ensure satisfiable control performance in the presence of attacks.
