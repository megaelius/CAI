Just as an explicit parameterisation of system dynamics by state, i.e., a choice of coordinates,
can impede the identification of general structure, so it is too with an explicit parameterisation
of system dynamics by control. However, such explicit and fixed parameterisation by control is
commonplace in control theory, leading to definitions, methodologies, and results that depend
in unexpected ways on control parameterisation. In this paper a framework is presented for modelling
systems in geometric control theory in a manner that does not make any choice of parameterisation
by control; the systems are called "tautological control systems." For the framework to be coherent,
it relies in a fundamental way on topologies for spaces of vector fields. As such, classes of systems
are considered possessing a variety of degrees of regularity: finitely differentiable; Lipschitz;
smooth; real analytic. In each case, explicit geometric seminorms are provided for the topologies
of spaces of vector fields that enable straightforward descriptions of time-varying vector fields
and control systems. As part of the development, theorems are proved for regular (including real
analytic) dependence on initial conditions of flows of vector fields depending measurably on time.
Classes of "ordinary" control systems are characterised that interact with the regularity under
consideration in a comprehensive way. In this framework, for example, the statement that "a smooth
or real analytic control-affine system is a smooth or real analytic control system" becomes a theorem.
Correspondences between ordinary control systems and tautological control systems are carefully
examined, and trajectory correspondence between the two classes is proved for control-affine
systems and for systems with general control dependence when the control set is compact.
