We survey coding techniques that enable reliable transmission at rates that approach the capacity
of an arbitrary discrete memoryless channel. In particular, we take the point of view of modern coding
theory and discuss how recent advances in coding for symmetric channels help provide more efficient
solutions for the asymmetric case. We consider, in more detail, three basic coding paradigms. The
first one is Gallager's scheme that consists of concatenating a linear code with a non-linear mapping
so that the input distribution can be appropriately shaped. We explicitly show that both polar codes
and spatially coupled codes can be employed in this scenario. Furthermore, we derive a scaling law
between the gap to capacity, the cardinality of the input and output alphabets, and the required
size of the mapper. The second one is an integrated scheme in which the code is used both for source
coding, in order to create codewords distributed according to the capacity-achieving input distribution,
and for channel coding, in order to provide error protection. Such a technique has been recently
introduced by Honda and Yamamoto in the context of polar codes, and we show how to apply it also to the
design of sparse graph codes. The third paradigm is based on an idea of B\"ocherer and Mathar, and
separates the two tasks of source coding and channel coding by a chaining construction that binds
together several codewords. We present conditions for the source code and the channel code, and
we describe how to combine any source code with any channel code that fulfill those conditions, in
order to provide capacity-achieving schemes for asymmetric channels. In particular, we show that
polar codes, spatially coupled codes, and homophonic codes are suitable as basic building blocks
of the proposed coding strategy.
