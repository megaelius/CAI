Our results can be viewed as applications of algebraic combinatorics in random matrix theory. These
applications are motivated by the predictive power of random matrix theory for the statistical
behavior of the celebrated Riemann $\zeta$-function (and $L$-functions in general), which was
discovered by Montgomery (with regard to zeros of $L$-functions) and by Keating and Snaith (with
regard to values of $L$-functions). The first results revolve around a new operation on partitions,
which we call overlap. We prove two overlap identities for so-called Littlewood-Schur functions.
The first overlap identity represents the Littlewood-Schur function $LS _\lambda(X; Y)$ as a sum
over subsets of $X$, while the second overlap identity essentially represents $LS_\lambda(X;
Y)$ as a sum over pairs of partitions whose overlap equals $\lambda$. Both identities are derived
by applying Laplace expansion to a determinantal formula for Littlewood-Schur functions due to
Moens and Van der Jeugt. In addition, we give two visual characterizations for the set of all pairs
of partitions whose overlap is equal to a partition $\lambda$. The second result is an asymptotic
formula for averages of mixed ratios of characteristic polynomials over the unitary group, where
mixed ratios are products of ratios and/or logarithmic derivatives. Our proof of this formula is
a generalization of Bump and Gamburd's elegant combinatorial proof of Conrey, Forrester and Snaith's
formula for averages of ratios of characteristic polynomials over the unitary group. The generalization
relies on three combinatorial results, namely the first overlap identity, a new variant of the Murnaghan-Nakayama
rule and an idea from vertex operator formalism. We conclude this thesis by explaining how this approach
might lead to new number theoretic proofs.
