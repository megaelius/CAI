A K-tier heterogeneous downlink millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network with user-centric
small cell deployments is studied in this paper. In particular, we consider a heterogeneous network
model with user equipments (UEs) being distributed according to a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP).
Specifically, we address two cluster processes, namely (i) Thomas cluster process, where the UEs
are clustered around the base stations (BSs) and the distances between UEs and the BS are modeled
as Gaussian distributed, and (ii) Matern cluster process, where the UEs are scattered according
to a uniform distribution. In addition, distinguishing features of mmWave communications including
directional beamforming and a sophisticated path loss model incorporating both line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) transmissions, are taken into account. Initially, the complementary
cumulative distribution function (CCDF) and probability density function (PDF) of path loss are
provided. Subsequently, using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive a general expression
for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability. Our results demonstrate
that coverage probability can be improved by decreasing the size of UE clusters around BSs, decreasing
the beamwidth of the main lobe, or increasing the main lobe directivity gain. Moreover, interference
has noticeable influence on the coverage performance of our model. We also show that better coverage
performance is achieved in the presence of clustered users compared to the case in which the users
are distributed according to a Poisson Point Process (PPP).
