We start by reviewing the relation between toposes and Grothendieck quantales. We improve results
of previous work on this relation by giving both a characterisation of the map from the tensor product
of two internal sup-lattices to another sup-lattice and a description of the category of internal
locales of a topos in terms of the associated Grothendieck quantale. We then construct a convolution
product, corresponding to internal composition of matrices, on the set of positive lower semi-continuous
functions on the underlying locale of the quantale attached to a topos. In good cases, this convolution
product does restrict into a well defined convolution product on a subset of the set of continuous
functions and defines a convolution C* algebra attached to the quantale. In the last part of this
article we investigate in details these attached C* algebras in the special case of an atomic topos.
In this situation the related Grothendieck quantale corresponds to a hypergroupoid. Relatively
simple finiteness conditions on this hypergroupoid appear in order to obtain an interesting C*
algebra. This algebra corresponds to a hypergroupoid algebra which comes endowed with an arithmetic
sub-algebra and a time evolution. We conclude by showing that the existence of a hypergroupoid satisfying
all the requirements attached to a specified atomic topos is equivalent to the fact that the topos
is locally decidable and locally separated. Also in this situation the time evolution only depends
on the topos and is described by a (canonical) principal Q+* bundle on the topos. The BC-system and
more generally the double cosets algebras are special cases of this situation.
