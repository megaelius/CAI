In arXiv:1609.05666v1 [math.PR] a functional limit theorem was proved. It states that symmetric
processes associated with resistance metric measure spaces converge when the underlying spaces
converge with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff-vague topology, and a certain uniform recurrence
condition is satisfied. Such a theorem finds particularly nice applications if the resistance
metric measure space is a metric measure tree. To illustrate this, we state functional limit theorems
in old and new examples of suitably rescaled random walks in random environment on trees. First,
we take a critical Galton-Watson tree conditioned on its total progeny and a non-lattice branching
random walk on $\mathbb{R}^d$ indexed by it. Then, conditional on that, we consider a biased random
walk on the range of the preceding. Here, by non-lattice we mean that distinct branches of the tree
do not intersect once mapped in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This excludes the possibility that the random walk
on the range may jump from one branch to the other without returning to the recent common ancestor.
We prove, after introducing the bias parameter $\beta^{n^{-1/4}}$, for some $\beta>1$, that the
biased random walk on the range of a large critical non-lattice branching random walk converges
to a Brownian motion in a random Gaussian potential on Aldous' continuum random tree (CRT). Our second
new result introduces the scaling limit of the edge-reinforced random walk on a size-conditioned
Galton-Watson tree with finite variance as a Brownian motion in a random Gaussian potential on the
CRT with a drift proportional to the distance to the root.
