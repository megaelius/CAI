Painlev\'e metrics are a class of Riemannian metrics which generalize the well-known separable
metrics of St\"ackel to the case in which the additive separation of variables for the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation is achieved in terms of groups of independent variables rather than the complete orthogonal
separation into ordinary differential equations which characterizes the St\"ackel case. Our
goal in this paper is to carry out for Painlev\'e metrics the generalization of the analysis, which
has been extensively performed in the St\"ackel case, of the relation between separation of variables
for the Hamilton-Jacobi and Helmholtz equations, and of the connections between quadratic first
integrals of the geodesic flow and symmetry operators for the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We thus
obtain the generalization for Painlev\'e metrics of the Robertson separability conditions for
the Helmholtz equation which are familiar from the St\"ackel case, and a formulation thereof in
terms of the vanishing of the off-block diagonal components of the Ricci tensor, which generalizes
the one obtained by Eisenhart for St\"ackel metrics. We also show that when the generalized Robertson
conditions are satisfied, there exist $r<n$ linearly independent second-order differential
operators which commute with the Laplace-Beltrami operator and which are mutually commuting.
These operators admit the block-separable solutions of the Helmholtz equation as formal eigenfunctions,
with the separation constants as eigenvalues. Finally, we study conformal deformations which
are compatible with the separation into blocks of variables of the Helmholtz equation for Painlev\'e
metrics, leading to solutions which are $R$-separable in blocks. The paper concludes with a set
of open questions and perspectives.
