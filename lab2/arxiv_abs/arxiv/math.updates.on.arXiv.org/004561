Many animal cells change their shape depending on the stiffness of the substrate on which they are
cultured: they assume small, rounded shapes in soft ECMs, they elongate within stiffer ECMs, and
flatten out on hard substrates. Cells tend to prefer stiffer parts of the substrate, a phenomenon
known as durotaxis. Such mechanosensitive responses to ECM mechanics are key to understanding
the regulation of biological tissues by mechanical cues, as it occurs, e.g., during angiogenesis
and the alignment of cells in muscles and tendons. Although it is well established that the mechanical
cell-ECM interactions are mediated by focal adhesions, the mechanosensitive molecular complexes
linking the cytoskeleton to the substrate, it is poorly understood how the stiffness-dependent
kinetics of the focal adhesions eventually produce the observed interdependence of substrate
stiffness and cell shape and cell behavior. Here we show that the mechanosensitive behavior of single-focal
adhesions, cell contractility and substrate adhesivity together suffice to explain the observed
stiffness-dependent behavior of cells. We introduce a multiscale computational model that is
based upon the following assumptions: (1) cells apply forces onto the substrate through FAs; (2)
the FAs grow and stabilize due to these forces; (3) within a given time-interval, the force that the
FAs experience is lower on soft substrates than on stiffer substrates due to the time it takes to reach
mechanical equilibrium; and (4) smaller FAs are pulled from the substrate more easily than larger
FAs. Our model combines the cellular Potts model for the cells with a finite-element model for the
substrate, and describes each FA using differential equations. Together these assumptions provide
a unifying model for cell spreading, cell elongation and durotaxis in response to substrate mechanics.
