In development of the old conjecture of Stuckelberg, Wheeler and Feynman on the so-called "one electron
Universe", we elaborate a purely algebraic construction of an ensemble of identical pointlike
particles occupying the same worldline and moving in concord with each other. In the proposed construction
one does not make use of any differential equations of motion, Lagrangians, etc. Instead, we define
a ``unique'' worldline implicitly, by a system of nonlinear polynomial equations containing a
time-like parameter. Then at each instant there is a whole set of solutions setting the coordinates
of particles-copies localized on the unique worldline and moving along it. There naturally arise
two different kinds of such particles which correspond to real or complex conjugate roots of the
initial system of polynomial equations, respectively. At some particular time instants, one encounters
the transitions between these two kinds of particles-roots that model the processes of annihilation
or creation of a pair ``particle-antiparticle''. We restrict by consideration of nonrelativistic
collective dynamics of the ensemble of such particles on a plane. Making use of the techniques of
resultants of polynomials, the generating system reduces to a pair of polynomial equations for
one unknown, with coefficients depending on time. Then the well-known Vieta formulas predetermine
the existence of time-independent constraints on the positions of particles-roots and their time
derivatives. We demonstrate that for a very wide class of the initial polynomials (with polynomial
dependence of the coefficients on time) these constraints always take place and have the form of
the conservation laws for total momentum, angular momentum and (the analogue of) total mechanical
energy of the ``closed'' system of particles.
