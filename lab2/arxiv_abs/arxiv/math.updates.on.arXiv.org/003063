In this paper, we consider Maxwell's equations in linear dispersive media described by a single-pole
Lorentz model for electronic polarization. We study two classes of commonly used spatial discretizations:
finite difference methods (FD) with arbitrary even order accuracy in space and high spatial order
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods. Both types of spatial discretizations are
coupled with second order semi-implicit leap-frog and implicit trapezoidal temporal schemes
studied in our previous research [5,6]. By performing detailed dispersion analysis for the semi-discrete
and fully discrete schemes, we obtain rigorous quantification of the dispersion error for Lorentz
dispersive dielectrics. In particular, comparisons of dispersion error can be made taking into
account the model parameters, and mesh sizes in the design of the two types of schemes. The results
for the numerical dispersion analysis can guide us in the optimal choice of discretization parameters
for the more complicated and nonlinear models. The numerical dispersion analysis of the fully discrete
FD and DG schemes, for the dispersive Maxwell model considered in this paper, clearly indicate the
dependence of the numerical dispersion errors on spatial and temporal discretizations, their
order of accuracy, mesh discretization parameters and model parameters. The results obtained
here cannot be arrived at by considering discretizations of Maxwell's equations in free space.
In particular, our results contrast the advantages and disadvantages of using high order FD or DG
schemes and leap-frog or trapezoidal time integrators over different frequency ranges using a
variety of measures of numerical dispersion errors. Finally, we highlight the limitations of the
second order accurate temporal discretizations considered.
