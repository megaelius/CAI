This thesis deals with applications of experimental mathematics to a number of problems. The first
problem is related to random graph statistics. We consider a certain class of Galton-Watson random
trees and look at the total height statistic. We provide an automated procedure for computing values
of the moments of this statistic. Next, we investigate several problems related to lattice paths
staying below a line of rational slope. These results are largely data-based. Using the generated
data, we are able to find recurrences for the number of such paths for the cases of slopes 3/2 and 5/2.
There is also investigation of a generalization of these problems to three dimensions. We also examine
generalizations of Sister Celine's method and Gosper's algorithm for evaluating summations.
For both, we greatly extend the classes of applicable functions and applications to proving, or
reproving in an automated way, interesting combinatorial problems. For the generalization of
Sister Celine's method, we allow summations of arbitrary products of hypergeometric terms and
linear recurrent sequences with rational coefficients. We also show a partial result related to
the bunk bed conjecture, a problem concerning random finite graphs. Let $G$ be a finite graph. Remove
edges from $G\square K_2$ independently and with the same probability. In $G\square K_2$, there
is an edge placed between all vertices of $G$ and the corresponding vertex in a copy of $G$. Then, label
these vertices as either $(v,0)$ or $(v,1)$ for each $v\in V(G)$. The conjecture says that for any
$x,y \in V(G)$, it is least as likely to have $(x,0)$ connected to $(y,0)$ as to have $(x,0)$ connected
to $(y,1)$. We prove the conjecture in the case that only two of the edges going between the two copes
of $G$ are retained.
