The method of covariate adjustment is often used for estimation of population average treatment
effects in observational studies. Graphical rules for determining all valid covariate adjustment
sets from an assumed causal graphical model are well known. Restricting attention to causal linear
models, a recent article derived two novel graphical criteria: one to compare the asymptotic variance
of linear regression treatment effect estimators that control for certain distinct adjustment
sets and another to identify the optimal adjustment set that yields the least squares treatment
effect estimator with the smallest asymptotic variance among consistent adjusted least squares
estimators. In this paper we show that the same graphical criteria can be used in non-parametric
causal graphical models when treatment effects are estimated by contrasts involving non-parametrically
adjusted estimators of the interventional means. We also provide a graphical criterion for determining
the optimal adjustment set among the minimal adjustment sets, which is valid for both linear and
non-parametric estimators. We provide a new graphical criterion for comparing time dependent
adjustment sets, that is, sets comprised by covariates that adjust for future treatments and that
are themselves affected by earlier treatments. We show by example that uniformly optimal time dependent
adjustment sets do not always exist. In addition, for point interventions, we provide a sound and
complete graphical criterion for determining when a non-parametric optimally adjusted estimator
of an interventional mean, or of a contrast of interventional means, is as efficient as an efficient
estimator of the same parameter that exploits the information in the conditional independencies
encoded in the non-parametric causal graphical model.
