Simulation in media with multiple continua where each continuum interacts with every other is often
challenging due to multiple scales and high contrast. One needs some types of model reduction. One
of the approaches is multi-continuum technique, where every process in each continuum is modeled
separately and an interaction term is added. Direct numerical simulation in multi scale media is
usually not practicable. For this reason, one constructs the corresponding homogenized equations.
The paper develops a hierarchical approach for solving cell problems at a dense network of macroscopic
points with an essentially optimal computation cost. The method employs the fact that neighboring
representative volume elements (RVEs) share similar features; and effective properties of the
neighboring RVEs are close to each other. The hierarchical approach reduces computation cost by
using different levels of resolution for cell problems at different macroscopic points. The method
requires a hierarchy of macroscopic grid points and a corresponding nested approximation spaces
with different levels of resolution. Each level of macroscopic points is assigned to an approximation
finite element (FE) space which is used to solve the cell problems at the macroscopic points in that
level. We prove rigorously that this hierarchical method achieves the same level of accuracy as
that of the full solve where cell problems at every macroscopic point are solved using the FE spaces
with the highest level of resolution, but at the essentially optimal computation cost. Numerical
implementation that computes effective permeabilities of a two scale multicontinuum system via
the numerical solutions of the cell problems supports the analytical results. Finally, we prove
the homogenization convergence for our multiscale multi-continuum system.
