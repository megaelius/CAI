The Symmetric Primal-Dual Simplex Pivoting Decision Strategy (spdspds) is a novel iterative algorithm
to solve linear programming (LP) problems. Each iteration is based on a systematic selection and
application of one among the newly identified set of four distinct types of simplex pivots defined
over a symmetric primal-dual pair of LP. The two types of classical (standard) simplex pivots are
the Primal Standard Pivot with positive (or zero) indicator, and the Dual Standard Pivot with negative
(or zero) indicator. The two newly identified pivot types are: the Primal Tricky Pivot with positive
indicator and the Dual Tricky Pivot with negative indicator. For notational convenience, this
algorithm is discussed using the Tucker's Compact Symmetric Tableau (CST) for Linear Programming
problems expressed in the standard (canonical) form representing the Symmetric Primal-Dual Pair.
An analysis of the evolution of the Tableau data entries pattern observed as the iterations proceed
is also presented. A classification of the LP problem into one of the eight types is identified based
on the data entries pattern observed in the final/terminal Tableau. An infeasibility index associated
with an LP is defined as the number of primal and dual variables that are infeasible. A measure of goodness
(global effective measure) of a pivot selection is defined & determined as/by the decrease in the
infeasibility index associated with such a pivot selection. Further enhancement in computational
efficiency can be achieved by the utilization of the proposed concept of binding constraints. When
further reduction in the infeasibility index is not possible, then the tableau is checked for the
terminal tableau type to facilitate the problem classification
