The system that describes the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) and the thermal cloud
at finite temperature consists of a nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) and a quantum Boltzmann (QB) equations.
In such a system of trapped Bose gases at finite temperature, the QB equation corresponds to the evolution
of the density distribution function of the thermal cloud and the NLS is the equation of the condensate.
The quantum Boltzmann collision operator in this temperature regime is the sum of two operators
$C_{12}$ and $C_{22}$, which describe collisions of the condensate and the non-condenstate atoms
and collisions between non-condensate atoms. Above the BEC critical temperature, the system is
reduced to an equation containing only $C_{22}$, which possesses a blow-up positive radial solution
with respect to the $L^\infty$ norm (cf. \cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}). On the other hand,
at the very low temperature regime, the system becomes an equation of $C_{12}$, with a different
(much higher order) transition probability, which has a unique global positive radial solution
with weighted $L^1$ norm (cf. \cite{AlonsoGambaBinh}). In the current temperature regime, we
first decouple the QB and NLS equations, then show a global existence and uniqueness result for positive
radial solutions to the spatially homogeneous kinetic system. Different from the case considered
in \cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}, due to the presence of the BEC, the collision integrals
are associated to sophisticated energy manifolds rather than spheres, since the particle energy
is approximated by the Bogoliubov dispersion law. Moreover, the mass of the full system is not conserved
while it is conserved for the case considered in \cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}. A new theory
is then supplied.
