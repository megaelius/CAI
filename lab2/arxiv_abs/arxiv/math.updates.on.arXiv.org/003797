It is known that for a non-linear dynamical system, periodic and quasi-periodic attractors can
be reconstructed in a discrete sense using time-delay embedding. Following this argument, it has
been shown that even chaotic non-linear systems can be represented as a linear system with intermittent
forcing. Although it is known that linear models such as those generated by the Hankel Dynamic Mode
Decomposition can - in principle - reconstruct any ergodic dynamical system, quantitative details
such as the required sampling rate and the number of delays remain unknown. This work addresses fundamental
issues related to the structure and conditioning of linear time delayed models of non-linear dynamics
on an attractor. First, we prove that, for scalar systems, the minimal number of time delays required
for perfect signal recovery is solely determined by the sparsity in the Fourier spectrum. For the
vector case, we devise a rank test and provide a geometric interpretation of the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of an accurate linear time delayed model. Further, we prove that the
output controllability index of a certain associated linear system serves as a tight upper bound
on the minimal number of time delays required. An explicit expression for the exact representation
of the linear model in the spectral domain is also provided. From a computational implementation
perspective, the effect of the sampling rate on the numerical conditioning of the time delayed model
is examined. As a natural extension of Baz\'{a}n's work, an upper bound on the 2-norm condition number
is derived, with the implication that conditioning can be improved with additional time delays
and/or decreasing sampling rates. Finally, it is explicitly shown that the underlying dynamics
can be accurately recovered using only a partial period of trajectory data.
