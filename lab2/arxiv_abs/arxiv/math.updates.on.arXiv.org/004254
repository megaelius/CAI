In a Non-Orthogonal Unicast and Multicast (NOUM) transmission system, a multicast stream intended
to all the receivers is superimposed in the power domain on the unicast streams. One layer of Successive
Interference Cancellation (SIC) is required at each receiver to remove the multicast stream before
decoding its intended unicast stream. In this paper, we first show that a linearly-precoded 1-layer
Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy at the transmitter can efficiently exploit this existing SIC receiver
architecture. We further propose multi-layer transmission strategies based on the generalized
RS and power-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). Two different objectives are studied
for the design of the precoders, namely, maximizing the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of the unicast messages
and maximizing the system Energy Efficiency (EE), both subject to Quality of Service (QoS) rate
requirements of all the messages and a sum power constraint. A Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error
(WMMSE)-based algorithm and a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based algorithm are proposed
to solve the WSR and EE problems, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed RS-assisted
NOUM transmission strategies are more spectrally and energy efficient than the conventional Multi-User
Linear-Precoding (MU-LP), Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and power-domain NOMA in a wide range
of user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths and qualities of
channel state information at the transmitter) and network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes).
It is superior for the downlink multi-antenna NOUM transmission.
