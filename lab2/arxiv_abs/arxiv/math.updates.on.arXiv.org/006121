Ion transport, often described by the Poisson--Nernst--Planck (PNP) equations, is ubiquitous
in electrochemical devices and many biological processes of significance. In this work, we develop
conservative, positivity-preserving, energy dissipating, and implicit finite difference schemes
for solving the multi-dimensional PNP equations with multiple ionic species. A central-differencing
discretization based on harmonic-mean approximations is employed for the Nernst--Planck (NP)
equations. The backward Euler discretization in time is employed to derive a fully implicit nonlinear
system, which is efficiently solved by a newly proposed Newton's method. The improved computational
efficiency of the Newton's method originates from the usage of the electrostatic potential as the
iteration variable, rather than the unknowns of the nonlinear system that involves both the potential
and concentration of multiple ionic species. Numerical analysis proves that the numerical schemes
respect three desired analytical properties (conservation, positivity preserving, and energy
dissipation) fully discretely. Based on advantages brought by the harmonic-mean approximations,
we are able to establish estimate on the upper bound of condition numbers of coefficient matrices
in linear systems that are solved iteratively. The solvability and stability of the linearized
problem in the Newton's method are rigorously established as well. Numerical tests are performed
to confirm the anticipated numerical accuracy, computational efficiency, and structure-preserving
properties of the developed schemes. Adaptive time stepping is implemented for further efficiency
improvement. Finally, the proposed numerical approaches are applied to characterize ion transport
subject to a sinusoidal applied potential.
