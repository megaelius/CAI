In 1967, Gerencs\'er and Gy\'arf\'as proved the following seminal result in graph-Ramsey theory:
every 2-colored $K_n$ contains a monochromatic path on $\lceil(2n+1)/3\rceil$ vertices, and
this is best possible. In 1993, Erd\H os and Galvin started the investigation of the analogous problem
in countably infinite graphs. After a series of improvements, this problem was recently settled.
Since 1967, there have been hundreds of papers on finite graph-Ramsey theory with many of the most
important results being motivated by a series of conjectures of Burr and Erd\H os about graphs with
linear Ramsey numbers. In a sense, this paper begins a systematic study of infinite graph-Ramsey
theory, focusing on infinite analogues of these conjectures. The following are some of our main
results. (i) Let $G$ be a countably infinite, (one-way) locally finite graph with chromatic number
$\chi<\infty$. Every 2-colored $K_\mathbb{N}$ contains a monochromatic copy of $G$ with upper
density at least $\frac{1}{2(\chi-1)}$. (ii) Let $G$ be a countably infinite graph having the property
that there exists a finite set $X\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G-X$ has no finite dominating set (in
particular, graphs with bounded degeneracy have this property, as does the infinite random graph).
Every finitely-colored $K_\mathbb{N}$ contains a monochromatic copy of $G$ with positive upper
density. (iii) Let $T$ be a countably infinite tree. Every 2-colored $K_\mathbb{N}$ contains a
monochromatic copy of $T$ of upper density at least $1/2$. In particular, this is best possible for
$T_\infty$, the tree in which every vertex has infinite degree. (iv) Surprisingly, there exist
connected graphs $G$ such that every 2-colored $K_\mathbb{N}$ contains a monochromatic copy of
$G$ which covers all but finitely many vertices of $\mathbb{N}$. In fact, we classify all forests
with this property.
