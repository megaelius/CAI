All algebras in a very large, axiomatically defined class of quantum nilpotent algebras are proved
to possess quantum cluster algebra structures under mild conditions. Furthermore, it is shown
that these quantum cluster algebras always equal the corresponding upper quantum cluster algebras.
Previous approaches to these problems for the construction of (quantum) cluster algebra structures
on (quantized) coordinate rings arising in Lie theory were done on a case by case basis relying on
the combinatorics of each concrete family. The results of the paper have a broad range of applications
to these problems, including the construction of quantum cluster algebra structures on quantum
unipotent groups and quantum double Bruhat cells (the Berenstein-Zelevinsky conjecture), and
treat these problems from a unified perspective. All such applications also establish equality
between the constructed quantum cluster algebras and their upper counterparts. The proofs rely
on Chatters' notion of noncommutative unique factorization domains. Toric frames are constructed
by considering sequences of homogeneous prime elements of chains of noncommutative UFDs (a generalization
of the construction of Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebras) and mutations are obtained by altering chains
of noncommutative UFDs. Along the way, an intricate (and unified) combinatorial model for the homogeneous
prime elements in chains of noncommutative UFDs and their alterations is developed. When applied
to special families, this recovers the combinatorics of Weyl groups and double Weyl groups previously
used in the construction and categorification of cluster algebras. It is expected that this combinatorial
model of sequences of homogeneous prime elements will have applications to the unified categorification
of quantum nilpotent algebras.
