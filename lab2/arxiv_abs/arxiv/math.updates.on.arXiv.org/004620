Wasserstein barycenters correspond to optimal solutions of transportation problems for several
marginals, which arise in a wide range of fields. In many applications, data is given as a set of probability
measures with finite support. The discrete barycenters in this setting exhibit favorable properties:
All barycenters have finite support and there always exists one with a provably sparse support.
Further, each barycenter allows a non-mass splitting optimal transport to each of the marginals.
Both sparsity and non-mass split are crucial to many applications. It is open whether the computation
of a discrete barycenter is possible in polynomial time. It is possible to find an exact barycenter
through linear programming, but the sizes of these programs may scale exponentially. In this paper,
we prove that there is a strongly polynomial, tight 2-approximation, based on a linear program where
the possible support is restricted to the union of supports of the measures. The resulting measure
is sparse, but an optimal transport to the measures will generally split mass. We then devise another
strongly polynomial algorithm to improve this measure to one for which there exists a non-mass splitting
transport of lower cost. The key aspect of this second algorithm is an update of the possible support
set to resolve mass split. Finally, we present an iterative scheme that alternates between these
two algorithms. The algorithm terminates with a 2-approximation that has both a sparse support
and an associated non-mass splitting optimal transport. We conclude with some sample computations
and an analysis of the scaling of our algorithms, exhibiting vast improvements in running time over
exact LP-based computations and practical errors that are much lower than the guaranteed 2-bound.
