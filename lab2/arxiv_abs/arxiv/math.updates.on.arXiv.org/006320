Objective: A novel structure based on channel-wise attention mechanism is presented in this paper.
Embedding with the proposed structure, an efficient classification model that accepts multi-lead
electrocardiogram (ECG) as input is constructed. Methods: One-dimensional convolutional neural
networks (CNN) have proven to be effective in pervasive classification tasks, enabling the automatic
extraction of features while classifying targets. We implement the Residual connection and design
a structure which can learn the weights from the information contained in different channels in
the input feature map during the training process. An indicator named mean square deviation is introduced
to monitor the performance of a particular model segment in the classification task on the two out
of the five ECG classes. The data in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is used and a series of control
experiments is conducted. Results: Utilizing both leads of the ECG signals as input to the neural
network classifier can achieve better classification results than those from using single channel
inputs in different application scenarios. Models embedded with the channel-wise attention structure
always achieve better scores on sensitivity and precision than the plain Resnet models. The proposed
model exceeds the performance of most of the state-of-the-art models in ventricular ectopic beats
(VEB) classification, and achieves competitive scores for supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB).
Conclusion: Adopting more lead ECG signals as input can increase the dimensions of the input feature
maps, helping to improve both the performance and generalization of the network model. Significance:
Due to its end-to-end characteristics, and the extensible intrinsic for multi-lead heart diseases
diagnosing, the proposed model can be used for the real-time ECG tracking of ECG waveforms for Holter
or wearable devices.
