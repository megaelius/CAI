In this paper, we start from an extension of the notion of holonomy on diffeological bundles, reformulate
the notion of regular Lie group or Fr\"olicher Lie groups, state an Ambrose-Singer theorem that
enlarges the one stated in \cite{Ma2}, and conclude with a differential geometric treatment of
KP hierarchy. The examples of Lie groups that are studied are principally those obtained by enlarging
some graded Fr\"olicher (Lie) algebras such as formal $q-$series of the quantum algebra of pseudo-differential
operators. These deformations can be defined for classical pseudo-differential operators but
they are used here on formal pseudo-differential operators in order to get a differential geometric
framework to deal with the KP hierarchy that is known to be completely integrable in the sense of Frobenius.
Here, we get an integration of the Zakharov-Shabat connection form by means of smooth sections of
a (differential geometric) bundle with structure group some groups of $q-$deformed operators.
The integration obtained by Mulase \cite{M1}, and the key tools he developped, are totally recovered
on the germs of the smooth maps of our construction. The tool coming from (classical) differential
geometry used in this construction is the holonomy group, on which we have an Ambrose-Singer-like
theorem: the Lie algebra is spanned by the curvature elements. This result is proved for any connection
a diffeological principal bundle with structure group a regular Fr\"olicher Lie group. The case
of a (classical) Lie group modelled on a complete locally convex topological vector space is also
recovered and the work developped in \cite{Ma,Ma2} is completed.
