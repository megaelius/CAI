In this paper, we compare maximum likelihood (ML), quasi likelihood (QL) and weighted least squares
(WLS) estimators for proportional error nonlinear regression models. Literature on thermoluminescence
sedimentary dating revealed another estimator similar to weighted least squares but observed
responses used as weights. This estimator that we refer to as data weighted least squares (DWLS)
is also included in the comparison. We show that on the order $\sigma, $ all four estimators behave
similar to ordinary least squares estimators for standard linear regression models. On the order
of $\sigma^2, $ the estimators have biases. Formulae that are valid in the limit of small measurement
error are derived for the biases and the variances of the four estimators. The maximum likelihood
estimator has less bias compared to the quasi likelihood estimator. Conditions are derived under
which weighted least squares and maximum likelihood estimators have similar biases. On the order
of $\sigma^ {2} $, all estimators have similar standard errors. On higher order of $\sigma$, maximum
likelihood estimator has smaller variance compared to quasi likelihood estimator, provided that
the random errors have the same first four moments as the normal distribution. The maximum likelihood
and quasi-likelihood estimating equations are unbiased. In large samples, these two estimators
are distributed as multivariate normal. The estimating equations for weighted least squares and
data weighted least squares are biased. However, in the limit of $\sigma \to 0$ and $n \to \infty,
$ if $ n^ {1/2} \sigma$ remains bounded, these two estimators are also distributed as multivariate
normal. A simulation study justified the applicability of the derived formulae in the presence
of measurement errors typical in sedimentary data. Results are illustrated with a data set from
thermoluminescence sedimentary dating.
