We study the problem of joint load balancing and interference mitigation in heterogeneous networks
(HetNets) in which massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) macro cell base station (BS)
equipped with a large number of antennas, overlaid with wireless self-backhauled small cells (SCs)
are assumed. Self-backhauled SC BSs with full-duplex communication employing regular antenna
arrays serve both macro users and SC users by using the wireless backhaul from macro BS in the same
frequency band. We formulate the joint load balancing and interference mitigation problem as a
network utility maximization subject to wireless backhaul constraints. Subsequently, leveraging
the framework of stochastic optimization, the problem is decoupled into dynamic scheduling of
macro cell users, backhaul provisioning of SCs, and offloading macro cell users to SCs as a function
of interference and backhaul links. Via numerical results, we show the performance gains of our
proposed framework under the impact of small cells density, number of base station antennas, and
transmit power levels at low and high frequency bands. We further provide insights into the performance
analysis and convergence of the proposed framework. The numerical results show that the proposed
user association algorithm outperforms other baselines. Interestingly, we find that even at lower
frequency band the performance of open access small cell is close to that of closed access at some
operating points, the open access full- duplex small cell still yields higher gain as compared to
the closed access at higher frequency bands. With increasing the small cell density or the wireless
backhaul quality, the open access full- duplex small cells outperform and achieve a 5.6x gain in
terms of cell-edge performance as compared to the closed access ones in ultra-dense networks with
350 small cell base stations per km2 .
