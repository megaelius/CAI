The paper is devoted to a study of generic representations (homomorphisms) of discrete countable
groups $\Gamma$ in Polish groups $G$, i.e. those elements in the Polish space $\mathrm{Rep}(\Gamma,G)$
of all representations of $\Gamma$ in $G$, whose orbit under the conjugation action of $G$ on $\mathrm{Rep}(\Gamma,G)$
is comeager. We investigate finite approximability, a strictly related notion, for actions on
countable structures such as tournaments, triangle-free graphs, and, more generally, $K_n$-free
graphs, and we show how it is related to the Ribes-Zalesski-like properties of the acting groups.
We prove that every finitely generated abelian group has a generic representation in the automorphism
group of the random tournament; in particular, that there is a comeager conjugacy class in this group.
Moreover, we formulate a general Ribes-Zalesskii-like condition on a group that guarantees finite
approximability of its actions on tournaments. It is left open if non-abelian free groups satisfy
it. We also provide a simpler proof of a recent result of Glasner, Kitroser and Melleray characterizing
groups having a generic permutation representation. Then we investigate representations of infinite
groups $\Gamma$ in automorphism groups of metric structures such as the isometry group $\mathrm{Iso}(\mathbb{U})$
of the Urysohn space, isometry group $\mathrm{Iso}(\mathbb{U}_1)$ of the Urysohn sphere, or the
linear isometry group $\mbox{LIso}(\mathbb{G})$ of the Gurarii space. We show that the conjugation
action of $\mathrm{Iso}(\mathbb{U})$ on $\mathrm{Rep}(\Gamma,\mathrm{Iso}(\mathbb{U}))$
is generically turbulent.
