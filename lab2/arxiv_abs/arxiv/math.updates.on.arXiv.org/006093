The Kuramoto model is a paradigm for studying oscillator networks with interplay between coupling
tending towards synchronization, and heterogeneity in the oscillator population driving away
from synchrony. In continuum versions of this model an oscillator population is represented by
a probability density on the circle. Ott and Antonsen identified a special class of densities which
is invariant under the dynamics and on which the dynamics are low-dimensional and analytically
tractable. The reduction to the OA manifold has been used to analyze the dynamics of many variants
of the Kuramoto model. To address the fundamental question of whether the OA manifold is attracting,
we develop a systematic technique using weighted averages of Poisson measures for analyzing dynamics
off the OA manifold. We show that for models with a finite number of populations, the OA manifold is
{\it not} attracting in any sense; moreover, the dynamics off the OA manifold is often more complex
than on the OA manifold, even at the level of macroscopic order parameters. The OA manifold consists
of Poisson densities $\rho_\omega$. A simple extension of the OA manifold consists of averages
of pairs of Poisson densities; then the hyperbolic distance between the centroids of each Poisson
pair is a dynamical invariant (for each $\omega$). These conserved quantities, defined on the double
Poisson manifold, are a measure of the distance to the OA manifold. This invariance implies that
chimera states, which have some but not all populations in sync, can never be stable in the full state
space, even if stable in the OA manifold. More broadly, our framework facilitates the analysis of
multi-population continuum Kuramoto networks beyond the restrictions of the OA manifold, and
has the potential to reveal more intricate dynamical behavior than has previously been observed
for these networks.
