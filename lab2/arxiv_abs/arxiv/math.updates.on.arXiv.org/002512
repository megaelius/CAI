In the last decades a lot of work has been done in the study of Hilbert-Speiser fields. The first input
came from the important result contained in "Swan modules and Hilbert-Speiser number fields" (Greither,
Replogle, Rubin and Srivastav): $\mathbb{Q}$ is the only Hilbert-Speiser field, i.e. for every
number field $K\supsetneq \mathbb{Q}$ there exists a (cyclic of prime order) tame abelian extension
that does not have NIB. Then the research went towards the finer problem of finding crieria for $C_l$-Hilbert-Speiser
fields, i.e. fields such that every tame extension with Galois group isomorphic to $C_l$, the cyclic
group of prime order $l$, has NIB. In this work our purpose is to consider a weakened version of NIB:
we will say that a tame abelian extension $L/K$ of number fields has a weak normal integral basis if
$\mathcal{M}\otimes_{\mathscr{O}_K[G]}\mathscr{O}_L$ is free of rank $1$ over $\mathcal{M}$,
where $\mathcal{M}$ is the maximal order of $K[G]$. WNIB's have been studied for instance in [Gre90],
[Gre97] and [GJ12]. We shall ask the same questions substituting "WNIB" to "NIB" everywhere, and
we will denote the analogous condition of "Hilbert-Speiser field" by "Leopoldt field". We are going
to find mainly necessary conditions for number fields to be $C_l$-Leopoldt, where as before $l$
is a prime number, which also give criteria and (sometimes conditional) finiteness results for
$C_l$-Hilbert-Speiser fields; for instance we will see that this permits to correct a mistake contained
in the article "Real abelian fields satisfying the Hilbert-Speiser condition for some small primes
p" by Ichimura, whose overall Hilbert-Speiser-oriented techniques are supple enough to be applied
to our problem.
