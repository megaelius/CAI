We compute the holomorphic twists of four-dimensional superconformal algebras, and argue that
the resulting algebras act naturally by holomorphic vector fields on holomorphically twisted
superconformal theories. We demonstrate that this symmetry enhances to the action of an infinite-dimensional
local Lie algebra, the Dolbeault resolution of all holomorphic vector fields on a punctured superspace.
Global symmetries also enhance to the Dolbeault resolution of holomorphic functions valued in
the Lie algebra; at the classical level, both of these higher symmetry algebras act naturally on
the holomorphic twist of any Lagrangian theory, whether superconformal or not. We show that these
algebras are related to two-dimensional chiral algebras extracted from four-dimensional superconformal
theories in recent work; further deforming the differential induces the Koszul resolution of a
plane in $\mathbb{C}^2$, and the cohomology of the higher symmetry algebras are the usual Virasoro
and Kac-Moody chiral algebras. We show that the central extensions of those chiral algebras arise
from recently studied central extensions of our higher symmetry algebras. However, the higher
algebras admit many further deformations not originating in the global superconformal algebra;
these localize to any smooth complex curve in $\mathbb{C}^2$, resolving the holomorphic vector
fields there, and expect that they will lead to even more exotic behavior in the case of singular or
nonreduced curves. We consider explicit examples of $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories, and demonstrate
that an anomaly to realizing the higher symmetry algebra at the quantum level vanishes precisely
when the theory is, in fact, superconformal; for such theories, we also give an explicit description
of the chiral algebras that result after further deformation.
