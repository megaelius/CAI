Evaluating the Stieltjes transform, $\int_0^{\infty} f(x)(\omega+x)^{-1}\,\mathrm{d}x$,
by expanding the kernel of transformation about $\omega=0$ and then performing a term by term integration
lead to an infinite series whose terms are divergent integrals. An attempt to give meaning to the
series by assigning values to the divergent integrals generally yields a result that reproduces
the correct value up to some missing terms. This particular problem of missing terms has been solved
recently by lifting the integration in the complex plane, leading to the interpretation of the divergent
integrals by their finite parts and to the recovery of the missing terms as contributions coming
from the poles and branch points of the integrand in the complex plane [E.A. Galapon, {\it Proc. Roy.
Soc. A} {\bf 473}, 20160567 (2017)]. This means that the finite part of a divergent integral can be
rigorously employed to solve well-defined problems provided the set of rules governing its use
or its calculus is known. However, divergent integrals can be assigned values other than their finite
parts. Here we address the question whether the other values or interpretations of divergent integrals
have a calculus of their own that can be applied as a means of solving problems involving term by term
integration. We demonstrate, through the generalized Stieltjes transform $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)(\omega^2+x^2)^{-1}\mathrm{d}x$,
that the other interpretations follow the same set of rules as those of the finite part integral,
and then formulate the calculus of divergent integrals arising from term-by-term integration.
We find that the calculus does not prescribe a specific interpretation to the divergent integrals
but allows us to assign arbitrary values to them, with the missing terms automatically emerging
from the chosen interpretation of the divergent integrals itself.
