The Einstein vacuum equations on an n-dimensional toroidal geometry $\mathbb{M}^{n+1} =\mathbb{T}^{n}\times\mathbb{R^{+}}$
reduce to a system of n-dimensional nonlinear ODEs in terms of the set of toroidal radii $(a_{i}(t))_{i=1}^{n}$
or the radial moduli fields $(\psi_{i}(t))_{i=1}^{n} =(\log(a_{i}(t))_{i=1}^{n}$ of the n-torus
$\mathbb{T}^{n}$. This geometry is also the basis of Kasner-Bianchi-type cosmologies. The equations
are trivially satisfied for static solutions $\psi_{i}^{E}=\psi^{E}$ or radii $a_{i}^{E}=a^{E}$,
describing an initially static micro-universe or toroidal 'vacuum bubble'. It is Lyapunov stable
to short-pulse deterministic perturbations, which have a sharp Gaussian profile: the perturbed
radii rapidly converge to new 'attractors' and therefore to new stable equilibria. These perturbations
induce transitions between stable states. Introducing classical Gaussian random fluctuations,
with a regulated covariance, the moduli become Gaussian random fields paramatrising a 'toroidal
random geometry'. The randomly perturbed Einstein equations are interpreted as a randomly perturbed
n-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Non-vanishing 'cosmological constant' terms are
retained within the averaged equations since they are nonlinear. This is analogous to averaging
the Navier-Stokes equations in statistical turbulence theory, which yields an additional non-vanishing
Reynolds term since like the Einstein equations they are also of nonlinear hyperbolic type. The
expectations of the randomly perturbed toric radii can be estimated from a cluster-integral-type
cumulant expansion method. The initially static micro-universe or bubble undergoes eternal noise-induced
stochastic exponential growth or inflation. Random moduli fields within this scenario therefore
act like a 'dark energy'. Finally, a class of random perturbations is considered for which the Einstein
system is stable.
