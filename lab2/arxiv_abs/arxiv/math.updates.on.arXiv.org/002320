Recently, several experiments have demonstrated the existence of fractional diffusion in the
neuronal transmission occurringin the Purkinje cells, whose malfunctioning is known to be related
to the lack of voluntary coordination and the appearance of tremors. Also, a classical mathematical
feature is that (fractional) parabolic equations possess smoothing effects, in contrast with
the case of hyperbolic equations, which typically exhibit shocks and discontinuities. In this
paper, we show how a simple toy-model of a highly ramified structure, somehow inspired by that of
the Purkinje cells, may produce a fractional diffusion via the superposition of travelling waves
that solve a hyperbolic equation. This could suggest that the high ramification of the Purkinje
cells might have provided an evolutionary advantage of "smoothing" the transmission of signals
and avoiding shock propagations (at the price of slowing a bit such transmission). Although an experimental
confirmation of the possibility of such evolutionary advantage goes well beyond the goals of this
paper, we think that it is intriguing, as a mathematical counterpart, to consider the time fractional
diffusion as arising from the superposition of delayed travelling waves in highly ramified transmission
media. The case of a travelling concave parabola with sufficiently small curvature is explicitly
computed. The new link that we propose between time fractional diffusion and hyperbolic equation
also provides a novelty with respect to the usual paradigm relating time fractional diffusion with
parabolic equations in the limit. This paper is written in such a way as to be of interest to both biologists
and mathematician alike. In order to accomplish this aim, both complete explanations of the objects
considered and detailed lists of references are provided.
