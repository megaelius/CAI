Consider the Hamiltonian $abcd$ system in one dimension, with data posed in the energy space $H^1\times
H^1$. This model, introduced by Bona, Chen and Saut, is a well-known physical generalization of
the classical Boussinesq equations. The Hamiltonian case corresponds to the regime where $a,c<0$
and $b=d>0$. Under this regime, small solutions in the energy space are globally defined. A first
proof of decay for this $2\times 2$ system was given by the two authors and Poblete and Pozo, in a strongly
dispersive regime, i.e. under essentially the conditions \[ b=d > \frac29, \quad a,c<-\frac1{18}.
\] Additionally, decay was obtained inside a proper subset of the light cone $(-|t|,|t|)$. In this
paper, we improve the last result in three directions. First, we enlarge the set of parameters $(a,b,c,d)$
for which decay to zero is the only available option, considering now the so-called weakly dispersive
regime $a,c\sim 0$: we prove decay if now \[ b=d > \frac3{16}, \quad a,c<-\frac1{48}. \] This result
is sharp in the case where $a=c$, since for $a,c$ bigger, some $abcd$ linear waves of nonzero frequency
do have zero group velocity. Second, we sharply enlarge the interval of decay to consider the whole
light cone, that is to say, any interval of the form $|x|\sim |v|t$, for any $|v|<1$. This result rules
out, among other things, the existence of nonzero speed solitary waves in the regime where decay
is present. Finally, we prove decay to zero of small $abcd$ solutions in exterior regions $|x|\gg
|t|$, also discarding super-luminical small solitary waves. These three results are obtained
by performing new improved virial estimates for which better decay properties are deduced.
