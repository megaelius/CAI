We propose a new family of high order staggered semi-implicit discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods
for the simulation of natural convection problems. Assuming small temperature fluctuations,
the Boussinesq approximation is valid and the flow can simply be modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations coupled with a transport equation for the temperature and a buoyancy source term in the
momentum equation. Our numerical scheme is developed starting from the work presented in [TD14],
in which the spatial domain is discretized using a face-based staggered unstructured mesh. For
the computation of the advection and diffusion terms, two different algorithms are presented:
i) a purely Eulerian explicit upwind-type scheme and ii) a semi-Lagrangian approach. The first
methodology leads to a conservative scheme whose major drawback is the time step restriction imposed
by the CFL stability condition. On the contrary, computational efficiency can be notably improved
relying on a semi-Lagrangian approach. This method leads to an unconditionally stable scheme if
the diffusive terms are discretized implicitly. Once the advection and diffusion contributions
have been computed, the pressure Poisson equation is solved and the velocity is updated. As a second
model for the computation of buoyancy-driven flows, we also consider the full compressible Navier-Stokes
equations. The staggered semi-implicit DG method first proposed in [TD17] for all Mach number flows
is properly extended to account for the gravity source terms arising in the momentum and energy conservation
laws. The validity and the robustness of our novel class of staggered semi-implicit DG schemes is
assessed at the aid of several classical benchmark problems, showing in all cases a good agreement
with available numerical reference data. Finally, a detailed comparison between the incompressible
and the compressible solver is presented.
