We give a new construction of noncommutative surfaces via elliptic difference operators, attaching
a 1-parameter noncommutative deformation to any projective rational surface with smooth anticanonical
curve. The construction agrees with one implicit in work of Van den Bergh (iterated blowups of noncommutative
Hirzebruch surfaces), but the construction enables one to prove a number of new facts about these
surfaces. We show that they are noncommutative smooth proper surfaces in the sense of Chan and Nyman,
with projective Quot schemes, that moduli spaces of simple sheaves are Poisson and that moduli spaces
classifying semistable sheaves of rank 0 or 1 are projective. We further show that the action of SL_2(Z)
as derived autoequivalences of rational elliptic surfaces extends to an action as derived equivalences
of surfaces in our family with K^2=0. We also discuss applications to the theory of special functions
arising by interpreting moduli spaces of 1-dimensional sheaves as moduli spaces of difference
equations. When the moduli space is a single point, the equation is rigid, and we give an integral
representation for the solutions. More generally, twisting by line bundles corresponds to isomonodromy
deformations, so this gives rise to Lax pairs. When the moduli space is 2-dimensional, one obtains
Lax pairs for the elliptic Painlev\'e equation; this associates a Lax pair to any rational number,
of order twice the denominator. There is also an elliptic analogue of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence:
an analytic equivalence between categories of elliptic difference equations, swapping the role
of the shift of the equation and the nome of the curve.
