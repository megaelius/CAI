Let \begin{equation*} \mathcal{L}=A(r)\frac{d^2}{dr^2}-B(r)\frac d{dr} \end{equation*}
be a second order elliptic operator and consider the reaction diffusion equation with boundary
flux condition, \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned} &\mathcal{L}u=\Lambda u^p\ \text{for}\
r\in(R,\infty);\\ &u'(R)=-h;\\ &u\ge0\ \text{is minimal}, \end{aligned} \end{equation*}
where $R>0$, $h>0$ and $\Lambda=\Lambda(r)>0$. This equation is the radially symmetric
case of an equation of the form \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned} &Lu=\Lambda u^p\ \text{in}\
\mathbb{R}^d-D;\\ &a\nabla u\cdot \bar n=-h\ \text{on}\ \partial D;\\ &u\ge0 \ \text{is
minimal}, \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where \begin{equation*} L=\sum_{i,j=1}^da_{i,j}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial
x_i\partial x_j}-\sum_{i=1}^db_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \end{equation*} is a second
order elliptic operator, and where $d\ge2$, $h>0$ is continuous, $D\subset R^d$ is bounded,
and $\bar n$ is the unit inward normal to the domain $\mathbb{R}^d-\bar D$. The solution to either
of the above two equations may possess a free boundary. In the radially symmetric case, if $r^*(h)=\inf\{r>R:u(r)=0\}<\infty$,
we call this the radius of the free boundary; otherwise there is no free boundary. We normalize the
diffusion coefficient $A$ to be on unit order, consider the convection vector field $B$ to be on order
$r^m$, $m\in R$, pointing either inward $(-)$ or outward $(+)$, and consider the reaction coefficient
$\Lambda$ to be on order $r^{-j}$, $j\in R$. We show for which choices of $m$, $(\pm)$ and $j$ a free
boundary exists, and when it exists, we show how it grows in $h$ as a function of $m$, $(\pm)$ and $j$.
These results are then used to get information for the free boundary in the non-radial case.
