We consider the problem of symmetric secret key generation in quasi-static/static environments,
where the amount of common randomness obtained from the characteristics of the physical layer channel
is limited. In order to provide a high-rate secret key generation mechanism, we introduce a method
called induced randomness. In this method, locally generated randomness is assumed at the legitimate
parties. Such randomness together with the uniqueness provided by the wireless channel coefficients
are utilized to enable high-rate secret key generation. We describe the proposed secret key generation
protocol for two scenarios; for the case where the legitimate parties have a direct link (the first
scenario), and for the case where the legitimate parties do not have a direct link and communicate
through an untrusted relay (the second scenario). After the exchange of the induced randomness,
highly correlated samples are generated by the legitimate parties. These samples are then quantized,
reconciled, and hashed to compensate for the information leakage to the eavesdropper and to allow
verification of consistency of the generated key bit sequences. We utilize semantic security measures
and information-theoretic inequalities to upper bound the probability of successful eavesdropping
attack in terms of the mutual information measures that can be numerically computed. Given certain
reasonable system parameters this bound is numerically evaluated to be $2^{-31}$ and $2^{-11.3}$
in the first and the second scenario, respectively. Furthermore, in the considered numerical setup,
the bit generation rate is 64 bits/packet, the BER is 0.002% and 0.0029% in the first and the second
scenario, respectively, and the eavesdropper's average BER in both scenarios is almost 50%. The
probability of accepting a mismatched key is upper bounded and evaluated in the numerical setup
to be 0.0015% for both scenarios.
