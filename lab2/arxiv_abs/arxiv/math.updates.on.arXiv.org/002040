Sensing and reciprocating cellular systems (SARs) are important for the operation of many biological
systems. Production in interferon (IFN) SARs is achieved through activation of the Jak-Stat pathway,
and downstream upregulation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IFN transcription, but the role
that high and low affinity IFNs play in this process remains unclear. We present a comparative between
a minimal spatio-temporal partial differential equation (PDE) model and a novel spatio-structural-temporal
(SST) model for the consideration of receptor, binding, and metabolic aspects of SAR behaviour.
Using the SST framework, we simulate single- and multi-cluster paradigms of IFN communication.
Simulations reveal a cyclic process between the binding of IFN to the receptor, and the consequent
increase in metabolism, decreasing the propensity for binding due to the internal feed-back mechanism.
One observes the effect of heterogeneity between cellular clusters, allowing them to individualise
and increase local production, and within clusters, where we observe `sub popular quiescence';
a process whereby intra-cluster subpopulations reduce their binding and metabolism such that
other such subpopulations may augment their production. Finally, we observe the ability for low
affinity IFN to communicate a long range signal, where high affinity cannot, and the breakdown of
this relationship through the introduction of cell motility. Biological systems may utilise cell
motility where environments are unrestrictive and may use fixed system, with low affinity communication,
where a localised response is desirable.
