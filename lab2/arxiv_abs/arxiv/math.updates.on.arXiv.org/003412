The stochastic models investigated in this paper describe the evolution of a set of $F_N$ identical
balls scattered into $N$ urns connected by an underlying symmetrical graph with constant degree
$h_N$. After some random amount of time {\em all the balls} of any urn are redistributed locally,
among the $h_N$ urns of its neighborhood. The allocation of balls is done at random according to a
set of weights which depend on the state of the system. The main original features of this context
is that the cardinality $h_N$ of the range of interaction is not necessarily linear with respect
to $N$ as in a classical mean-field context and, also, that the number of simultaneous jumps of the
process is not bounded due to the redistribution of all balls of an urn at the same time. The approach
relies on the analysis of the evolution of the local empirical distributions associated to the state
of urns located in the neighborhood of a given urn. Under convenient conditions, by taking an appropriate
Wasserstein distance and by establishing several technical estimates for local empirical distributions,
we are able to prove mean-field convergence results. When the load per node goes to infinity, a convergence
result for the invariant distribution of the associated McKean-Vlasov process is obtained for
several allocation policies. For the class of power of $d$ choices policies, we show that the associated
invariant measure has an asymptotic finite support property under this regime. This result differs
somewhat from the classical double exponential decay property usually encountered in the literature
for power of $d$ choices policies.
