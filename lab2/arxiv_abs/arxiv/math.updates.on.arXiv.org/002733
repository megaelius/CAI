In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for modeling the time-variant stochastic channels
of diffusive mobile MC systems. In particular, we consider a diffusive mobile MC system consisting
of a pair of transmitter and receiver nano-machines suspended in a fluid medium with a uniform bulk
flow, where we assume that either the transmitter, or the receiver, or both are mobile and we model
the mobility by Brownian motion. The transmitter and receiver nano-machines exchange information
via diffusive signaling molecules. Due to the random movements of the transmitter and receiver
nano-machines, the statistics of the channel impulse response (CIR) change over time. We derive
closed-form expressions for the mean, the autocorrelation function (ACF), the cumulative distribution
function (CDF), and the probability density function (PDF) of the time-variant CIR. Exploiting
the ACF, we define the coherence time of the time-variant MC channel as a metric for characterization
of the variations of the CIR. The derived CDF is employed for calculation of the outage probability
of the system. We also show that under certain conditions, the PDF of the CIR can be accurately approximated
by a Log-normal distribution. Based on this approximation, we derive a simple model for outdated
channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for evaluation
of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the considered MC system. In order to investigate
the impact of CIR decorrelation over time, we compare the performances of a detector with perfect
CSI knowledge and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of the proposed analytical
expressions is verified via particle-based simulation of the Brownian motion.
