The goal of this paper is to provide mathematically rigorous tools for modelling the evolution of
a community of interacting individuals. We model the population by a measure space where the measure
determines the abundance of individual preferences. The preferences of an individual are described
by a measurable choice of a rough path. We focus on the case of weakly interacting systems, where we
are able to exhibit the existence and uniqueness of consistent solutions. In general, solutions
are continuum of interacting threads analogous to the huge number of individual atomic trajectories
that together make up the motion of a fluid. The evolution of the population need not be governed by
any over-arching PDE. Although one can match the standard nonlinear parabolic PDEs of McKean-Vlasov
type with specific examples of communities in this case. The bulk behaviour of the evolving population
provides a solution to the PDE. An important technical result is continuity of the behaviour of the
system with respect to changes in the measure assigning weight to individuals. Replacing the deterministic
measure with the empirical distribution of an i.i.d. sample from it leads to many standard models,
and applying the continuity result allows easy proofs for propagation of chaos. The rigorous underpinning
presented here leads to uncomplicated models which have wide applicability in both the physical
and social sciences. We make no presumption that the macroscopic dynamics are modelled by a PDE.
This work builds on the fine probability literature considering the limit behaviour for systems
where a large no of particles are interacting with independent preferences; there is also work on
continuum models with preferences described by a semi-martingale measure. We mention some of the
key papers.
