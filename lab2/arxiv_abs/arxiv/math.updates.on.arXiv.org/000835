We study nonlocal equations from the area of peridynamics on bounded domains. In our companion paper,
we discover that, on $\mathbb{R}^n$, the governing operator in peridynamics, which involves a
convolution, is a bounded function of the classical (local) governing operator. Building on this,
we define an abstract convolution operator on bounded domains. The abstract convolution operator
is a function of the classical operator, defined by a Hilbert basis available due to the purely discrete
spectrum of the latter. As governing operator of the nonlocal equation we use a function of the classical
operator, this allows us to incorporate local boundary conditions into nonlocal theories. For
the homogeneous wave equation with the considered boundary conditions, we prove that continuity
is preserved by time evolution. We give explicit solution expressions for the initial value problems
with prominent boundary conditions such as periodic, antiperiodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet. In
order to connect to the standard convolution, we give an integral representation of the abstract
convolution operator. We present additional "simple" convolutionsbased on periodic and antiperiodic
boundary conditions that lead Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. We present a numerical
study of the solutions of the wave equation. For discretization, we employ a weak formulation based
on a Galerkin projection and use piecewise polynomials on each element which allows discontinuities
of the approximate solution at the element borders. We study convergence order of solutions with
respect to polynomial order and observe optimal convergence. We depict the solutions for each boundary
condition.
