We show that the entire class of polar codes (up to a natural necessary condition) converge to capacity
at block lengths polynomial in the gap to capacity, while simultaneously achieving failure probabilities
that are exponentially small in the block length (i.e., decoding fails with probability $\exp(-N^{\Omega(1)})$
for codes of length $N$). Previously this combination was known only for one specific family within
the class of polar codes, whereas we establish this whenever the polar code exhibits a condition
necessary for any polarization. Our results adapt and strengthen a local analysis of polar codes
due to the authors with Nakkiran and Rudra [Proc. STOC 2018]. Their analysis related the time-local
behavior of a martingale to its global convergence, and this allowed them to prove that the broad
class of polar codes converge to capacity at polynomial block lengths. Their analysis easily adapts
to show exponentially small failure probabilities, provided the associated martingale, the ``Arikan
martingale'', exhibits a corresponding strong local effect. The main contribution of this work
is a much stronger local analysis of the Arikan martingale. This leads to the general result claimed
above. In addition to our general result, we also show, for the first time, polar codes that achieve
failure probability $\exp(-N^{\beta})$ for any $\beta < 1$ while converging to capacity at block
length polynomial in the gap to capacity. Finally we also show that the ``local'' approach can be
combined with any analysis of failure probability of an arbitrary polar code to get essentially
the same failure probability while achieving block length polynomial in the gap to capacity.
