The problem of obtaining network coding maps for the physical layer network coded two-way relay
channel is considered, using the denoise-and-forward forward protocol. It is known that network
coding maps used at the relay node which ensure unique decodability at the end nodes form a Latin Square.
Also, it is known that minimum distance of the effective constellation at the relay node becomes
zero, when the ratio of the fade coefficients from the end node to the relay node, belongs to a finite
set of complex numbers determined by the signal set used, called the singular fade states. Furthermore,
it has been shown recently that the problem of obtaining network coding maps which remove the harmful
effects of singular fade states, reduces to the one of obtaining Latin Squares, which satisfy certain
constraints called \textit{singularity removal constraints}. In this paper, it is shown that
the singularity removal constraints along with the row and column exclusion conditions of a Latin
Square, can be compactly represented by a graph called the \textit{singularity removal graph}
determined by the singular fade state and the signal set used. It is shown that a Latin Square which
removes a singular fade state can be obtained from a proper vertex coloring of the corresponding
singularity removal graph. The minimum number of symbols used to fill in a Latin Square which removes
a singular fade state is equal to the chromatic number of the singularity removal graph. It is shown
that for any square $M$-QAM signal set, there exists singularity removal graphs whose chromatic
numbers exceed $M$ and hence require more than $M$ colors for vertex coloring. Also, it is shown that
for any $2^{\lambda}$-PSK signal set, $\lambda \geq 3,$ all the singularity removal graphs can
be colored using $2^{\lambda}$ colors.
