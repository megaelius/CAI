Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication
is becoming a serious contender for future wireless networks. The reason for this attention is due
to reliable communication and low cost deployment offered by the RIS based communication systems
compared to the conventional massive MIMO systems. However, the performance of an RIS assisted
MIMO system heavily depends on the quality of channel state information available at both ends.
As communicating devices and RIS are in close proximity, the desired channels can be modeled as line-of-sight
(LOS) channels, where dominant components comes from LOS paths. Thus, leading to ill-conditioned
channel matrices. To estimate these channel matrices with high quality, we propose a two stage channel
estimation method for RIS aided MIMO time-division duplexing (TDD) communication systems. In
particular, we employ the conventional TDD based MIMO channel estimation technique in the first
stage to estimate the direct MIMO channel between terminals with no RIS. Whereas, in the second stage
of the channel estimation process, we propose to use a recently developed bilinear adaptive vector
approximate message passing (BAdVAMP) algorithm to estimate ill-conditioned RIS channels. The
BAdVAMP method belongs to the class of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms and it is used
in wide range of estimation and learning problems. We also propose a phase shift design for the RIS
using the estimated channels. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes
the total channel gain at the user. A closed-form expression to obtain the phase shift of each passive
element in the RIS is also derived. Numerical results show that the proposed BAdVAMP based RIS channel
estimation performs better than its counterpart i.e., bilinear generalized AMP (BiGAMP) based
RIS channel estimation scheme.
