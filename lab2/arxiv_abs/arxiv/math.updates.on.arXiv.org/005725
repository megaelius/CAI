Dynamic phenomena in social and biological sciences can often be modeled by employing reaction-diffusion
equations. When addressing the control of these modes, from a mathematical viewpoint one of the
main challenges is that, because of the intrinsic nature of the models under consideration, the
solution, typically a proportion or a density function, needs to preserve given lower and upper
bounds. Controlling the system to the desired final configuration then becomes complex, and sometimes
even impossible. In the present work, we analyze the controllability to constant steady-states
of spatially homogeneous semilinear heat equations, with constraints in the state, and using boundary
controls, which is indeed a natural way of acting on the system in the present context. The nonlinearities
considered are among the most frequent: monostable and bistable ones. We prove that controlling
the system to a constant steady-state may become impossible when the diffusivity is too small (or
when the domain is large), due to the existence of barrier functions. When such an obstruction does
not arise, we build sophisticated control strategies combining the dissipativity of the system,
the existence of traveling waves and some connectivity of the set of steady-states. This connectivity
allows building paths that the controlled trajectories can follow, in a long time, with small oscillations,
preserving the natural constraints of the system. This kind of strategy was successfully implemented
in one-space dimension, where phase plane analysis techniques allowed to decode the nature of the
set of steady-states. These techniques fail in the present multi-dimensional setting. We employ
a fictitious domain technique, extending the system to a larger ball, and building paths of radially
symmetric solution that can then be restricted to the original domain.
