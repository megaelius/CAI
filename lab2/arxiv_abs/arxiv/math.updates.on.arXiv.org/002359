Let $X:=\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ be an affine Noetherian scheme, and $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{N}$
be a pair of finitely generated $R$-modules. Denote their Rees algebras by $\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M})$
and $\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{N})$. Let $\mathcal{N}^{n}$ be the $n$th homogeneous component of
$\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{N})$ and let $\mathcal{M}^{n}$ be the image of the $n$th homegeneous component
of $\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M})$ in $\mathcal{N}^n$. Denote by $\overline{\mathcal{M}^{n}}$
be the integral closure of $\mathcal{M}^{n}$ in $\mathcal{N}^{n}$. We prove that $\mathrm{Ass}_{X}(\mathcal{N}^{n}/\overline{\mathcal{M}^{n}})$
and $\mathrm{Ass}_{X}(\mathcal{N}^{n}/\mathcal{M}^{n})$ are asymptotically stable, generalizing
known results for the case where $\mathcal{M}$ is an ideal or where $\mathcal{N}$ is a free module.
Suppose either that $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ are free at the generic point of each irreducible
component of $X$ or $\mathcal{N}$ is contained in a free $R$-module. When $X$ is universally catenary,
we prove a generalization of a classical result due to McAdam and obtain a geometric classification
of the points appearing in $\mathrm{Ass}_{X}(\mathcal{N}^{n}/\overline{\mathcal{M}^{n}})$.
Notably, we show that if $x \in \mathrm{Ass}_{X}(\mathcal{N}^{n}/\overline{\mathcal{M}^{n}})$
for some $n$, then $x$ is the generic point of a codimension-one component of the nonfree locus of
$\mathcal{N}/\mathcal{M}$ or $x$ is a generic point of an irreducible set in $X$ where the fiber
dimension $\mathrm{Proj}(\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M})) \rightarrow X$ jumps. We prove a converse
to this result without requiring $X$ to be universally catenary. Many of our results are stated and
proved more generally for standard graded algebras. Also, we recover, strengthen, and prove a sort
of converse of an important result of Kleiman and Thorup about integral dependence of modules.
