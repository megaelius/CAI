We prove that the Tutte embeddings (a.k.a. harmonic/embeddings) of certain random planar maps
converge to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity ($\gamma$-LQG). Specifically, we treat mated-CRT
maps, which are discretized matings of correlated continuum random trees, and $\gamma$ ranges
from $0$ to $2$ as one varies the correlation parameter. We also show that the associated space-filling
path on the embedded map converges to space-filling SLE$_{\kappa}$ for $\kappa =16/\gamma^2$
(in the annealed sense) and that simple random walk on the embedded map converges to Brownian motion
(in the quenched sense). Our arguments also yield analogous statements for the Smith (square tiling)
embedding of the mated-CRT map. This work constitutes the first proof that a discrete conformal
embedding of a random planar map converges to LQG. Many more such statements have been conjectured.
Since the mated-CRT map can be viewed as a coarse-grained approximation to other random planar maps
(the UIPT, tree-weighted maps, bipolar-oriented maps, etc.), our results indicate a potential
approach for proving that embeddings of these maps converge to LQG as well. To prove the main result,
we establish several (independently interesting) theorems about LQG surfaces decorated by space-filling
SLE. There is a natural way to use the SLE curve to divide the plane into `cells' corresponding to vertices
of the mated-CRT map. We study the law of the shape of the origin-containing cell, in particular proving
moments for the ratio of its squared diameter to its area. We also give bounds on the degree of the origin-containing
cell and establish a form of ergodicity for the entire configuration. Ultimately, we use these properties
to show (using a general theorem proved in a separate paper) that random walk on these cells converges
to a time change of Brownian motion, which in turn leads to the Tutte embedding result.
