In this paper, we study holomorphic approximation using boundary value problems for $\partial$
on an annulus in the Hilbert space setting. The associated boundary conditions for $\partial$ are
the mixed boundary problems on an annulus. We characterize pseudoconvexity and Runge type property
of the domain by the vanishing of related L 2 cohomology groups. Holomorphic approximation theory
plays an important role in function theory in one and several complex variables. In one complex variable,
the classical Runge approximation theorem is related to solving the $\partial$ equation with compact
support (see e.g. Theorem 1.3.1 in H{\"o}rmander's book [8]). In several complex variables, it
is shown in [15] that holomorphic approximation can also be formulated in terms of Dolbeault cohomology
groups. We refer the reader to the recent paper [4] for a comprehensive and up-to-date account of
this rich subject. The purpose of this paper is to associate holomorphic approximation to a mix boundary
value problem for $\partial$ on an annulus in the L 2 setting. Let $\Omega$ 1 and $\Omega$ 2 be two relatively
compact domains in a complex hermitian manifold X of complex dimension n such that $\Omega$ 2 $\subset$$\subset$
$\Omega$ 1. Consider the annulus $\Omega$ = $\Omega$ 1 \ $\Omega$ 2 between $\Omega$ 1 and $\Omega$
2. Let $\partial$ and $\partial$ c be the (weak) maximal closure and the (strong) minimal closure
of the differential operator $\partial$. The two operators are naturally dual to each other (see
[2]). The $\partial$-Neumann problem on a domain arises naturally and is of fundamental importance
in in several complex variables (see [8, 9], [5] or [1]). The $\partial$-Neumann problem on an annulus
between two pseudoconvex domains in C n has been studied earlier (see [18], [19], [10] and [2]). Recently,
Li and Shaw [16] introduce the following mixed boundary problem for $\partial$ on the annulus $\Omega$.
It was then extended by Chakrabarti and Harrington in [3] where, in particular, they weaken the regularity
condition on the inner boundary of the annulus from the earlier work in [18] and [16]. In the L 2 setting,
the $\partial$ mix operator on the annulus is the closed realization of $\partial$ which satisfies
the $\partial$-Neumann boundary condition on the outer boundary b$\Omega$ 1 and the $\partial$-Cauchy
problem on the inner boundary b$\Omega$ 2. For 0 $\le$ p, q $\le$ n and u $\in$ L 2 p,q ($\Omega$), u $\in$
Dom($\partial$ mix) if and only if there exists v $\in$ L 2 p,q+1 ($\Omega$) and a sequence (u $\nu$)
$\nu$$\in$N $\subset$ L 2 p,q ($\Omega$) which vanish near $\partial$$\Omega$ 2 such that u $\nu$
$\rightarrow$ u in L 2 p,q ($\Omega$) and $\partial$u $\nu$ $\rightarrow$ v in L 2 p,q+1 ($\Omega$).
If u $\in$ Dom($\partial$ mix), then we define $\partial$ mix u = v. It is obvious that $\partial$
mix is a densely defined closed operator from 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 32E30,
