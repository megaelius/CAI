Dirac, Fock, and Podolsky [Ref. 1] devised a relativistic model in 1932 in which a fixed number of
$N$ Dirac electrons interact through a second-quantized electromagnetic field. It is formulated
with the help of a multi-time wave function $\psi(t_1,\mathbf{x}_1,...,t_N,\mathbf{x}_N)$
that generalizes the Schr\"odinger multi-particle wave function to allow for a manifestly relativistic
formulation of wave mechanics. The dynamics is given in terms of $N$ evolution equations that have
to be solved simultaneously. Integrability imposes a rather strict constraint on the possible
forms of interaction between the $N$ particles and makes the rigorous construction of interacting
dynamics a long-standing problem, also present in the modern formulation of quantum field theory.
For a simplified version of the multi-time model, in our case describing $N$ Dirac electrons that
interact through a relativistic scalar field, we prove well-posedness of the corresponding multi-time
initial value problem and discuss the mechanism and type of interaction between the charges. For
the sake of mathematical rigor we are forced to employ an ultraviolet cut-off in the scalar field.
Although this again breaks the desired relativistic invariance, this violation occurs only on
the arbitrary small but finite length-scale of this cut-off. In view of recent progress in this field,
the main mathematical challenges faced in this work are, on the one hand, the unboundedness from
below of the free Dirac Hamiltonians and the unbounded, time-dependent interaction terms, and
on the other hand, the necessity of pointwise control of the multi-time wave function.
