Classical stochastic demography predicts that environmental stochasticity reduces population
growth rates and, thereby, can increase extinction risk. In contrast, the SAS-CFF model demonstrates
that environmental stochasticity can promote genetic diversity. Extending the SAS-CFF to account
for demography, I examine the simultaneous effects of environmental stochasticity on genetic
diversity and population persistence. Consistent with Gillespie's analysis, if the log-fitness
function is concave and allelic responses to the environment are not perfectly correlated, then
per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are positive and genetic diversity is maintained in the
sense of stochastic persistence i.e. allelic frequencies tend to stay away from zero almost-surely
and in probability. Alternatively, if the log-fitness function is convex, then per-capita growth
rates of rare alleles are negative and an allele asymptotically fixates with probability one. If
the population's low-density, per-capita growth rate is positive, then the population persists
in the sense of stochastic persistence, else it goes asymptotically extinct with probability one.
In contrast to per-capita growth rates of rare alleles, the population's per-capita growth rate
is a decreasing function of the concavity of the log-fitness function. Moreover, when the log-fitness
function is concave, allelic diversity increases the population's per-capita growth rate while
decreasing the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles, and environmental stochasticity increases
the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles but decreases the population's per-capita growth rate.
Collectively, these results (i) highlight how mechanisms promoting population persistence may
be at odds with mechanisms promoting genetic diversity, and (ii) provide conditions under which
population persistence relies on existing standing genetic variation.
