If $K$ is a simplicial $k$-complex, the standard van Kampen obstructions tells you whether $K$ can
be embedded into $\mathbb R^{2k}$ or not (provided $k\neq 2$). We describe how the obstruction changes
if we replace $\mathbb R^{2k}$ by a closed PL $2k$-manifold satisfying a certain technical condition:
We require that every map $f\colon |K| \to M$ is homotopic to a map $f'\colon |K| \to M$ such that $f'(|K^{(k-1)}|)$
fits into some $2k$-ball in $M$, where $K^{(k-1)}$ stands for the $(k-1)$-skeleton of $K$. The technical
condition is satisfied, in particular, either if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected or if $K$ is the $k$-skeleton
of $n$-simplex, $\Delta_n^{(k)}$, for some $n$. Under the technical condition, if $K$ embeds in
$M$, then our obstruction vanishes. In addition, if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected and $k \geq 3$, then
the obstruction is complete, that is, we get the reverse implication. If $M = S^{2k}$ (or $\mathbb
R^{2k}$) then the intersection form on $M$ vanishes and our obstruction coincides with the standard
van Kampen obstruction. However, if the intersection form is nontrivial, then our obstruction
is not linear (a cohomology class) but rather `quadratic' in a sense that it vanishes if and only if
a certain system of quadratic equations over integers is solvable. It remains to be determined whether
these systems can be solved algorithmically. Finally, the $\mathbb Z_2$-reduction of the obstruction
shows how to obtain a non-trivial upper bound for the K\"{u}hnel problem: determine the smallest
$n$ so that $\Delta_n^{(k)}$ does not embed into $M$. Also, the $\mathbb Z_2$-reduction is computable
and, if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected, it determines whether there is a map $f\colon |K| \to M$ which has
an even number of crossings of $f(\sigma)$ and $f(\tau)$ for each pair $(\sigma, \tau)$ of disjoint
$k$-simplices of $K$.
