The goal of this paper is to develop a general method to establish conditional ergodicity of infinite-dimensional
Markov chains. Given a Markov chain in a product space, we aim to understand the ergodic properties
of its conditional distributions given one of the components. Such questions play a fundamental
role in the ergodic theory of nonlinear filters. In the setting of Harris chains, conditional ergodicity
has been established under general nondegeneracy assumptions. Unfortunately, Markov chains
in infinite-dimensional state spaces are rarely amenable to the classical theory of Harris chains
due to the singularity of their transition probabilities, while topological and functional methods
that have been developed in the ergodic theory of infinite-dimensional Markov chains are not well
suited to the investigation of conditional distributions. We must therefore develop new measure-theoretic
tools in the ergodic theory of Markov chains that enable the investigation of conditional ergodicity
for infinite dimensional or weak-* ergodic processes. To this end, we first develop local counterparts
of zero-two laws that arise in the theory of Harris chains. These results give rise to ergodic theorems
for Markov chains that admit asymptotic couplings or that are locally mixing in the sense of H. F\"{o}llmer,
and to a non-Markovian ergodic theorem for stationary absolutely regular sequences. We proceed
to show that local ergodicity is inherited by conditioning on a nondegenerate observation process.
This is used to prove stability and unique ergodicity of the nonlinear filter. Finally, we show that
our abstract results can be applied to infinite-dimensional Markov processes that arise in several
settings, including dissipative stochastic partial differential equations, stochastic spin
systems and stochastic differential delay equations.
