This paper considers two important questions in the well-studied theory of graphs that are $F$-saturated.
A graph $G$ is called $F$-saturated if $G$ does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $F$, but the addition
of any edge creates a copy of $F$. We first resolve a fundamental question of minimizing the number
of cliques of size $r$ in a $K_s$-saturated graph for all sufficiently large numbers of vertices,
confirming a conjecture of Kritschgau, Methuku, Tait, and Timmons. We also go further and prove
a corresponding stability result. Next we minimize the number of cycles of length $r$ in a $K_s$-saturated
graph for all sufficiently large numbers of vertices, and classify the extremal graphs for most
values of $r$, answering another question of Kritschgau, Methuku, Tait, and Timmons for most $r$.
We then move on to a central and longstanding conjecture in graph saturation made by Tuza, which states
that for every graph $F$, the limit $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sat(n, F)}{n}$ exists,
where $\sat(n, F)$ denotes the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $F$-saturated graph. Pikhurko
made progress in the negative direction by considering families of graphs instead of a single graph,
and proved that there exists a graph family $\mathcal{F}$ of size $4$ for which $\lim_{n \rightarrow
\infty} \frac{\sat(n, \mathcal{F})}{n}$ does not exist (for a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$,
a graph $G$ is called $\mathcal{F}$-saturated if $G$ does not contain a copy of any graph in $\mathcal{F}$,
but the addition of any edge creates a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$, and $\sat(n, \mathcal{F})$
is defined similarly). We make the first improvement in 15 years by showing that there exist infinitely
many graph families of size $3$ where this limit does not exist. Our construction also extends to
the generalized saturation problem when we minimize the number of fixed-size cliques.
