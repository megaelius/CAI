In this paper, we investigate linear stability properties of the 2D isentropic compressible Euler
equations linearized around a shear flow given by a monotone profile, close to the Couette flow,
with constant density, in the domain $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{R}$. We begin by directly investigating
the Couette shear flow, where we characterize the linear growth of the compressible part of the fluid
while proving time decay for the incompressible part (inviscid damping with slower rates). Then
we extend the analysis to monotone shear flows near Couette, where we are able to give an upper bound,
superlinear in time, for the compressible part of the fluid. The incompressible part enjoys an inviscid
damping property, analogous to the Couette case. In the pure Couette case, we exploit the presence
of an additional conservation law (which connects the vorticity and the density on the moving frame)
in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the system. The result then follows by using
weighted energy estimates. In the general case, unfortunately, this conservation law no longer
holds. Therefore we define a suitable weighted energy functional for the whole system, which can
be used to estimate the irrotational component of the velocity but does not provide sharp bounds
on the solenoidal component. However, even in the absence of the aforementioned additional conservation
law, we are still able to show the existence of a functional relation which allows us to recover somehow
the vorticity from the density, on the moving frame. By combining the weighted energy estimates
with the functional relation we also recover the inviscid damping for the solenoidal component
of the velocity.
