For a Hausdorff topologized semilattice $X$ its $Lawson\;\; number$ $\bar\Lambda(X)$ is the smallest
cardinal $\kappa$ such that for any distinct points $x,y\in X$ there exists a family $\mathcal U$
of closed neighborhoods of $x$ in $X$ such that $|\mathcal U|\le\kappa$ and $\bigcap\mathcal U$
is a subsemilattice of $X$ that does not contain $y$. It follows that $\bar\Lambda(X)\le\bar\psi(X)$,
where $\bar\psi(X)$ is the smallest cardinal $\kappa$ such that for any point $x\in X$ there exists
a family $\mathcal U$ of closed neighborhoods of $x$ in $X$ such that $|\mathcal U|\le\kappa$ and
$\bigcap\mathcal U=\{x\}$. We prove that a compact Hausdorff semitopological semilattice $X$
is Lawson (i.e., has a base of the topology consisting of subsemilattices) if and only if $\bar\Lambda(X)=1$.
Each Hausdorff topological semilattice $X$ has Lawson number $\bar\Lambda(X)\le\omega$. On
the other hand, for any infinite cardinal $\lambda$ we construct a Hausdorff zero-dimensional
semitopological semilattice $X$ such that $|X|=\lambda$ and $\bar\Lambda(X)=\bar\psi(X)=cf(\lambda)$.
A topologized semilattice $X$ is called (i) $\omega$-$Lawson$ if $\bar\Lambda(X)\le\omega$;
(ii) $complete$ if each non-empty chain $C\subset X$ has $\inf C\in\overline{C}$ and $\sup C\in\overline{C}$.
We prove that for any complete subsemilattice $X$ of an $\omega$-Lawson semitopological semilattice
$Y$, the partial order $\le_X=\{(x,y)\in X\times X:xy=x\}$ of $X$ is closed in $Y\times Y$ and hence
$X$ is closed in $Y$. This implies that for any continuous homomorphism $h:X\to Y$ from a compete
topologized semilattice $X$ to an $\omega$-Lawson semitopological semilattice $Y$ the image
$h(X)$ is closed in $Y$.
