We introduce the post-processing preorder and equivalence relations for general measurements
on a possibly infinite-dimensional general probabilistic theory described by an order unit Banach
space $E$ with a Banach predual. We define the measurement space $\mathfrak{M}(E)$ as the set of
post-processing equivalence classes of continuous measurements on $E .$ We define the weak topology
on $\mathfrak{M} (E)$ as the weakest topology in which the state discrimination probabilities
for any finite-label ensembles are continuous and show that $\mathfrak{M}(E)$ equipped with the
convex operation corresponding to the probabilistic mixture of measurements can be regarded as
a compact convex set regularly embedded in a locally convex Hausdorff space. We also prove that the
measurement space $\mathfrak{M}(E) $ is infinite-dimensional except when the system is $1$-dimensional
and give a characterization of the post-processing monotone affine functional. We apply these
general results to the problems of simulability and incompatibility of measurements. We show that
the robustness measures of unsimulability and incompatibility coincide with the optimal ratio
of the state discrimination probability of measurement(s) relative to that of simulable or compatible
measurements, respectively. The latter result for incompatible measurements generalizes the
recent result for finite-dimensional quantum measurements. Throughout the paper, the fact that
any weakly$\ast$ continuous measurement can be arbitrarily approximated in the weak topology
by a post-processing increasing net of finite-outcome measurements is systematically used to
reduce the discussions to finite-outcome cases.
