In this paper, the following Stein-Weiss inequality with the fractional Poisson kernel, $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^n_{+}}\int_{\partial\mathbb{R}^n_{+}}|\xi|^{-\alpha}f(\xi)P(x,\xi,\gamma)g(x)|x|^{-\beta}d\xi
dx\leq C_{n,\alpha,\beta,p,q'}\|g\|_{L^{q'}(\mathbb{R}^n_{+})}\|f\|_{L^p(\partial \mathbb{R}^{n}_{+})}$$
where $P(x,\xi,\gamma)=\frac{x_n}{(|x'-\xi|^2+x_n^2)^{\frac{n+2-\gamma}{2}}}$, $2\le
\gamma<n$, $f\in L^{p}(\partial\mathbb{R}^n_{+})$, $g\in L^{q'}(\mathbb{R}^n_{+})$ and
$p,\ q'\in (1,\infty)$, satisfying $\frac{n-1}{n}\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q'}+\frac{\alpha+\beta+2-\gamma}{n}=1$,
is established using the weighted Hardy inequality in high dimensions and the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev
inequality with the fractional Poisson kernel ([9]). It is proved that there exist extremals for
the inequality (0.1). Then we provide the regularity estimates of positive solutions to the integral
systems which are the Euler-Lagrange equations of the extremals to the Stein-Weiss inequality
with the fractional Poisson kernel. Asymptotic behavior is also established for weighted integral
systems associated to the fractional Poisson kernel around the origin. Furthermore, with the help
of the method of moving plane in integral forms, it is also shown that the extremals of the inequality
(0.1) must be radially decreasing about the origin. Our result is inspired by the work of Hang, Wang
and Yan [18] where the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type inequality was first established when $\gamma=2$
and $\alpha=\beta=0$. The proof of the Stein-Weiss inequality (0.1) with the fractional Poisson
kernel in this paper uses our recent work on the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality with the fractional
Poisson kernel [9] and the present paper is a further study in this direction.
