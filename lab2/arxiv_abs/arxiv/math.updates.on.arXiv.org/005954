In this paper we consider the 2-component reaction-diffusion model that was recently obtained
by a systematic reduction of the 3-component Gilad et al. model for dryland ecosystem dynamics.
The nonlinear structure of this model is more involved than other more conceptual models, such as
the extended Klausmeier model, and the analysis a priori is more complicated. However, the present
model has a strong advantage over these more conceptual models in that it can be more directly linked
to ecological mechanisms and observations. Moreover, we find that the model exhibits a richness
of analytically tractable patterns that exceeds that of Klausmeier-type models. Our study focuses
on the 4-dimensional dynamical system associated with the reaction-diffusion model by considering
traveling waves in 1 spatial dimension. We use the methods of geometric singular perturbation theory
to establish the existence of a multitude of heteroclinic/homoclinic/periodic orbits that `jump'
between (normally hyperbolic) slow manifolds, representing various kinds of localized vegetation
patterns. The basic 1-front invasion patterns and 2-front spot/gap patterns that form the starting
point of our analysis have a direct ecological interpretation and appear naturally in simulations
of the model. By exploiting the rich nonlinear structure of the model, we construct many multi-front
patterns that are novel, both from the ecological and the mathematical point of view. In fact, we
argue that these orbits/patterns are not specific for the model considered here, but will also occur
in a much more general (singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion) setting. We conclude with a discussion
of the ecological and mathematical implications of our findings.
