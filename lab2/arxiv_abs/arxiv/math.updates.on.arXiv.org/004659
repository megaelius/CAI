The connective constant $\mu(G)$ of a quasi-transitive graph $G$ is the asymptotic growth rate
of the number of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on $G$ from a given starting vertex. We survey several
aspects of the relationship between the connective constant and the underlying graph $G$. $\bullet$
We present upper and lower bounds for $\mu$ in terms of the vertex-degree and girth of a transitive
graph. $\bullet$ We discuss the question of whether $\mu\ge\phi$ for transitive cubic graphs (where
$\phi$ denotes the golden mean), and we introduce the Fisher transformation for SAWs (that is, the
replacement of vertices by triangles). $\bullet$ We present strict inequalities for the connective
constants $\mu(G)$ of transitive graphs $G$, as $G$ varies. $\bullet$ As a consequence of the last,
the connective constant of a Cayley graph of a finitely generated group decreases strictly when
a new relator is added, and increases strictly when a non-trivial group element is declared to be
a further generator. $\bullet$ We describe so-called graph height functions within an account
of "bridges" for quasi-transitive graphs, and indicate that the bridge constant equals the connective
constant when the graph has a unimodular graph height function. $\bullet$ A partial answer is given
to the question of the locality of connective constants, based around the existence of unimodular
graph height functions. $\bullet$ Examples are presented of Cayley graphs of finitely presented
groups that possess graph height functions (that are, in addition, harmonic and unimodular), and
that do not. $\bullet$ The review closes with a brief account of the "speed" of SAW.
