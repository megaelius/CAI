In this paper, two kinds of occurrence mechanism on the phenomenon of concentration and the formation
of delta shock waves are analyzed and identified in the flux approximation limit of Riemann solutions
to the extended Chaplygin gas equations with Coulomb-like friction, whose special case can also
be seen as the model of the magnetogasdynamics with Coulomb-like friction. Firstly, by introducing
a transformation, the Riemann problem for the extended Chaplygin gas equations with Coulomb-like
friction is solved completely. Secondly, we rigorously show that, as the pressure vanishes, any
two-shock Riemann solution to the nonhomogeneous extended Chaplygin gas equations tends to a {\delta}-shock
solution to the corresponding nonhomogeneous transportation equations, and the intermediate
density between the two shocks tends to a weighted {\delta}-measure that forms the {\delta}-shock;
any two-rarefaction-wave Riemann solution to the nonhomogeneous extended Chaplygin gas equations
tends to a two-contact-discontinuity solution to the correspongding nonhomogeneous transportation
equations, and the nonvacuum intermediate state between the two rarefaction waves tends to a vacuum
state. At last, we also show that, as the pressure approaches the generalized Chaplygin pressure,
any two-shock Riemann solution to the nonhomogeneous extended Chaplygin gas equations tends to
a delta-shock solution to the correspongding nonhomogeneous generalized Chaplygin gas equations.
In a word, we have generalized all the results about the vanishing pressure limit now available for
homogeneous equations to the nonhomogeneous case.
