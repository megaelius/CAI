We introduce a new and extensive theory of noncommutative convexity along with a corresponding
theory of noncommutative functions. We establish noncommutative analogues of the fundamental
results from classical convexity theory, and apply these ideas to develop a noncommutative Choquet
theory that generalizes much of classical Choquet theory. The central objects of interest in noncommutative
convexity are noncommutative convex sets. The category of compact noncommutative sets is dual
to the category of operator systems, and there is a robust notion of extreme point for a noncommutative
convex set that is dual to Arveson's notion of boundary representation for an operator system. We
identify the C*-algebra of continuous noncommutative functions on a compact noncommutative convex
set as the maximal C*-algebra of the operator system of continuous noncommutative affine functions
on the set. In the noncommutative setting, unital completely positive maps on this C*-algebra play
the role of representing measures in the classical setting. The continuous convex noncommutative
functions determine an order on the set of unital completely positive maps that is analogous to the
classical Choquet order on probability measures. We characterize this order in terms of the extensions
and dilations of the maps, providing a powerful new perspective on the structure of completely positive
maps on operator systems. Finally, we establish a noncommutative generalization of the Choquet-Bishop-de
Leeuw theorem asserting that every point in a compact noncommutative convex set has a representing
map that is supported on the extreme boundary. In the separable case, we obtain a corresponding integral
representation theorem.
