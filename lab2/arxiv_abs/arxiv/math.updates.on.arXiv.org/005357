Vector/Pest control is essential to reduce the risk of vector-borne diseases or losses in crop fields.
Among biological control tools, the sterile insect technique (SIT), is the most promising one.
SIT control generally consists of massive releases of sterile insects in the targeted area in order
to reach elimination or to lower the pest population under a certain threshold. The models presented
here are minimalistic with respect to the number of parameters and variables. The first model deals
with the dynamics of the vector population while the second model, the SIT model, tackles the interaction
between treated males and wild female vectors. For the vector population model, the elimination
equilibrium $\mathbb{0}$ is globally asymptotically stable when the basic offspring number,
$\mathcal{R}$, is lower or equal to one, whereas $\mathbb{0}$ becomes unstable and one stable positive
equilibrium exists, with well-determined basins of attraction, when $\mathcal{R}>1$. For the
SIT model, we obtain a threshold number of treated male vectors above which the control of wild female
vectors is effective: the massive release control. When the amount of treated male vectors is lower
than the aforementioned threshold number, the SIT model experiences a bistable situation involving
the elimination equilibrium and a positive equilibrium. However, practically, massive releases
of sterile males are only possible for a short period of time. That is why, using the bistability property,
we develop a new strategy to maintain the wild population under a certain threshold, for a permanent
and sustainable low level of SIT control. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical
simulations, in the case of SIT mosquito control.
