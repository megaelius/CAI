Estimating causal interactions in complex dynamical systems is an important problem encountered
in many fields of current science. While a theoretical solution for detecting the causal interactions
has been previously formulated in the framework of prediction improvement, it generally requires
the computation of high-dimensional information functionals -- a situation invoking the curse
of dimensionality with increasing network size. Recently, several methods have been proposed
to alleviate this problem, based on iterative procedures for assessment of conditional (in)dependences.
In the current work, we bring a comparison of several such prominent approaches. This is done both
by theoretical comparison of the algorithms using a formulation in a common framework, and by numerical
simulations including realistic complex coupling patterns. The theoretical analysis highlights
the key similarities and differences between the algorithms, hinting on their comparative strengths
and weaknesses. The method assumptions and specific properties such as false positive control
and order dependence are discussed. Numerical simulations suggest that while the accuracy of most
of the algorithms is almost indistinguishable, there are substantial differences in their computational
demands, ranging theoretically from polynomial to exponential complexity, and leading to substantial
differences in computation time in realistic scenarios depending on the density and size of networks.
Based on analysis of the algorithms and numerical simulations, we propose a hybrid approach providing
competitive accuracy with improved computational efficiency.
