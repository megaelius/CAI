This paper derives stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for fluid dynamics from
a stochastic variational principle (SVP). The Legendre transform of the Lagrangian formulation
of these SPDEs yields their Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian form. The paper proceeds by: taking variations
in the SVP to derive stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations; writing their It\^o representation;
and then investigating the properties of these stochastic fluid models in comparison with each
other, and with the corresponding deterministic fluid models. The circulation properties of the
stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations are found to closely mimic those of the deterministic
ideal fluid models. As with deterministic ideal flows, motion along the stochastic Stratonovich
paths also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in incompressible stochastic flows.
However, these Stratonovich properties are not apparent in the equivalent It\^o representation,
because they are disguised by the quadratic covariation drift term arising in the Stratonovich
to It\^o transformation. This term is a geometric generalisation of the quadratic covariation
drift term already found for scalar densities in Stratonovich's famous 1966 paper. The paper also
derives motion equations for two examples of stochastic geophysical fluid dynamics (SGFD). The
importance of Kelvin's circulation theorem in the example of Stratonovich SGFD equations is emphasised
by deriving a conservation law for the potential vorticity of fluid particles moving along Stratonovich
stochastic paths in both the Euler-Boussinesq and quasigeostropic approximations. However,
again these conservation laws are not evident after making the transformation from the Stratonovich
representation to the equivalent It\^o representation, because of the quadratic covariation
drift term.
