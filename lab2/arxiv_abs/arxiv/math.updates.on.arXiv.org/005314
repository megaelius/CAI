Random graphs with latent geometric structure are popular models of social and biological networks,
with applications ranging from network user profiling to circuit design. These graphs are also
of purely theoretical interest within computer science, probability and statistics. A fundamental
initial question regarding these models is: when are these random graphs affected by their latent
geometry and when are they indistinguishable from simpler models without latent structure, such
as the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathcal{G}(n, p)$? We address this question for two of the most
well-studied models of random graphs with latent geometry -- the random intersection and random
geometric graph. Our results are as follows: (1) we prove that the random intersection graph converges
in total variation to $\mathcal{G}(n, p)$ when $d = \tilde{\omega}(n^3)$, and does not if $d = o(n^3)$,
resolving an open problem in Fill et al. (2000), Rybarczyk (2011) and Kim et al. (2018); (2) we provide
conditions under which the matrix of intersection sizes of random family of sets converges in total
variation to a symmetric matrix with independent Poisson entries, yielding the first total variation
convergence result for $\tau$-random intersection graphs to $\mathcal{G}(n, p)$; and (3) we show
that the random geometric graph on $\mathbb{S}^{d - 1}$ with edge density $p$ converges in total
variation to $\mathcal{G}(n, p)$ when $d = \tilde{\omega}\left(\min\{ pn^3, p^2 n^{7/2} \} \right)$,
yielding the first progress towards a conjecture of Bubeck et al. (2016). The first of these three
results was obtained simultaneously and independently by Bubeck, Racz and Richey.
