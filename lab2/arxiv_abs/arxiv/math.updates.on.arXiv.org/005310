Classically, one could imagine a completely static space, thus without time. As is known, this picture
is unconceivable in quantum physics due to vacuum fluctuations. The fundamental difference between
the two frameworks is that classical physics is commutative (simultaneous observables) while
quantum physics is intrinsically noncommutative (Heisenberg uncertainty relations). In this
sense, we may say that time is generated by noncommutativity; if this statement is correct, we should
be able to derive time out of a noncommutative space. We know that a von Neumann algebra is a noncommutative
space. About 50 years ago the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory revealed an intrinsic evolution associated
with any given (faithful, normal) state of a von Neumann algebra, so a noncommutative space is intrinsically
dynamical. This evolution is characterised by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger thermal equilibrium
condition in quantum statistical mechanics (Haag, Hugenholtz, Winnink), thus modular time is
related to temperature. Indeed, positivity of temperature fixes a quantum-thermodynamical arrow
of time. We shall sketch some aspects of our recent work extending the modular evolution to a quantum
operation (completely positive map) level and how this gives a mathematically rigorous understanding
of entropy bounds in physics and information theory. A key point is the relation with Jones' index
of subfactors. In the last part, we outline further recent entropy computations in relativistic
quantum field theory models by operator algebraic methods, that can be read also within classical
information theory. The information contained in a classical wave packet is defined by the modular
theory of standard subspaces and related to the quantum null energy inequality.
