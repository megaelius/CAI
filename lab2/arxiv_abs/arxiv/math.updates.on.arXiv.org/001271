Uncertainty quantification seeks to provide a quantitative means to understand complex systems
that are impacted by parametric uncertainty. The polynomial chaos method is a computational approach
to solve stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) by projecting the solution onto a space
of orthogonal polynomials of the stochastic variables and solving for the deterministic coefficients.
Polynomial chaos can be more efficient than Monte Carlo methods when the number of stochastic variables
is low, and the integration time is not too large. When performing long-term integration, however,
achieving accurate solutions often requires the space of polynomial functions to become unacceptably
large. This paper presents an alternative approach, where sets of empirical basis functions are
constructed by examining the behavior of the solution for fixed values of the random variables.
The empirical basis functions are evolved over time, which means that the total number can be kept
small, even when performing long-term integration. We introduce this method of empirical chaos
expansion, and apply it to a number of model equations, demonstrating that the computational time
scales linearly with the final integration time. That is not the case for polynomial chaos in general,
since achieving accuracy for long-term integration usually requires larger polynomial bases,
causing a nonlinear scaling with the final integration time. We also present an analytical method
that uses the dynamics of the SPDE to evolve the empirical basis functions and demonstrate how it
can be applied to extend the validity of empirical basis functions in time without the need to sample
additional realizations of the original SPDE.
