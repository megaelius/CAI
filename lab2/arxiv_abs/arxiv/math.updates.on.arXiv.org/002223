Flux balance analysis has proven an effective tool for analyzing metabolic networks. In flux balance
analysis, reaction rates and optimal pathways are ascertained by solving a linear program, in which
the growth rate is maximized subject to mass-balance constraints. A variety of cell functions in
response to environmental stimuli can be quantified using flux balance analysis by parameterizing
the linear program with respect to extracellular conditions. However, for most large, genome-scale
metabolic networks of practical interest, the resulting parametric problem has multiple and highly
degenerate optimal solutions, which are computationally challenging to handle. An improved multi-parametric
programming algorithm based on active-set methods is introduced in this paper to overcome these
computational difficulties. Degeneracy and multiplicity are handled, respectively, by introducing
generalized inverses and auxiliary objective functions into the formulation of the optimality
conditions. These improvements are especially effective for metabolic networks because their
stoichiometry matrices are generally sparse; thus, fast and efficient algorithms from sparse
linear algebra can be leveraged to compute generalized inverses and null-space bases. We illustrate
the application of our algorithm to flux balance analysis of metabolic networks by studying a reduced
metabolic model of Corynebacterium glutamicum and a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli. We
then demonstrate how the critical regions resulting from these studies can be associated with optimal
metabolic modes and discuss the physical relevance of optimal pathways arising from various auxiliary
objective functions. Achieving more than five-fold improvement in computational speed over existing
multi-parametric programming tools, the proposed algorithm proves promising in handling genome-scale
metabolic models.
