In this work we develop a scalable computational framework for the solution of PDE-constrained
optimal control problems under high/infinite-dimensional uncertainty. Specifically, we consider
a mean-variance risk adverse formulation of the stochastic optimization problem and employ a Taylor
expansion with respect to the uncertain parameter either to directly approximate the control objective
or as a control variate for Monte Carlo variance reduction. The evaluation of the mean and variance
of the Taylor approximation requires to efficiently compute the trace of the (preconditioned)
Hessian of the control objective. We propose to estimate such trace by solving a generalized eigenvalue
problem using a randomized algorithm that only requires the action of the Hessian in a small number
of random directions. Then, the computational work does not depend on the nominal dimension of the
uncertain parameter but only on the effective dimension (i.e. the rank of the preconditioned Hessian),
thus significantly alleviating or breaking the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, when the use
of the possibly biased Taylor approximation results in large error of the optimal control function,
we use such approximation as a control variate for variance reduction, which results in considerable
computational savings (several orders of magnitude) compared to a simple Monte Carlo method. We
demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed computational method for
two problems with infinite-dimensional uncertain parameters: a subsurface flow in a porous medium
modeled as an elliptic PDE, and a turbulent jet flow modeled as Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes
equations coupled with a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation. In particular, for the latter
(and more challenging) example we show scalability of our algorithm up to one million parameters
after discretization.
