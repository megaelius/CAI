In this paper, we consider a vehicular network in which the wireless nodes are located on a system
of roads. We model the roadways, which are predominantly straight and randomly oriented, by a Poisson
line process (PLP) and the locations of nodes on each road as a homogeneous 1D Poisson point process
(PPP). Assuming that each node transmits independently, the locations of transmitting and receiving
nodes are given by two Cox processes driven by the same PLP. For this setup, we derive the coverage
probability of a typical receiver, which is an arbitrarily chosen receiving node, assuming independent
Nakagami-$m$ fading over all wireless channels. Assuming that the typical receiver connects to
its closest transmitting node in the network, we first derive the distribution of the distance between
the typical receiver and the serving node to characterize the desired signal power. We then characterize
coverage probability for this setup, which involves two key technical challenges. First, we need
to handle several cases as the serving node can possibly be located on any line in the network and the
corresponding interference experienced at the typical receiver is different in each case. Second,
conditioning on the serving node imposes constraints on the spatial configuration of lines, which
require careful analysis of the conditional distribution of the lines. We address these challenges
in order to accurately characterize the interference experienced at the typical receiver. We then
derive an exact expression for coverage probability in terms of the derivative of Laplace transform
of interference power distribution. We analyze the trends in coverage probability as a function
of the network parameters: line density and node density. We also study the asymptotic behavior
of this model and compare the coverage performance with that of a homogeneous 2D PPP model with the
same node density.
