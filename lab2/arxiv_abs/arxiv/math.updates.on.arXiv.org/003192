Let $(\otimes_{j=1}^nV_j)[0]$ be the zero weight subspace of a tensor product of finite-dimensional
irreducible $\frak{sl}_2$-modules. The dynamical elliptic Bethe algebra is a commutative algebra
of differential operators acting on $(\otimes_{j=1}^nV_j)[0]$-valued functions on the Cartan
subalgebra of $\frak{sl}_2$. The algebra is generated by values of the coefficient $S_2(x)$ of
a certain differential operator $D=(d/dx)^2+S_2(x)$, defined to V. Rubtsov, A. Silantyev, D.
Talalaev in 2009. We express $S_2(x)$ in terms of the KZB operators introduced by G. Felder and C.
Wieszerkowski in 1994. We study the eigenfunctions of the dynamical elliptic Bethe algebra by the
Bethe ansatz method. Under certain assumptions we show that such Bethe eigenfunctions are in one-to-one
correspondence with ordered pairs of theta-polynomials of certain degree. The correspondence
between Bethe eigenfunctions and two-dimensional spaces, generated by the two theta-polynomials,
is an analog of the non-dynamical non-elliptic correspondence between the eigenvectors of the
$\frak{gl}_2$ Gaudin model and the two-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $\Bbb C[x]$,
due to E. Mukhin, V. Tarasov, A. Varchenko. We obtain a counting result for, equivalently, certain
solutions of the Bethe ansatz equation, certain fibers of the elliptic Wronski map, or ratios of
theta polynomials, whose derivative is of a certain form. We give an asymptotic expansion for Bethe
eigenfunctions in a certain limit, and deduce from that that the Weyl involution acting on Bethe
eigenfunctions coincides with the action of an analytic involution given by the transposition
of theta-polynomials in the associated ordered pair.
