For integers $n>2$ and $k>0$, an $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin square is an $n\times n$ array of $k$-subsets
(called blocks) of an $nk$-set (of treatments), such that each treatment occurs once in each row
and once in each column of the array. A semi-Latin square is uniform if every pair of blocks, not in
the same row or column, intersect in the same positive number of treatments. It is known that a uniform
$(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin square is Schur optimal in the class of all $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin
squares, and here we show that when a uniform $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin square exists, the Schur
optimal $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin squares are precisely the uniform ones. We then compare uniform
semi-Latin squares using the criterion of pairwise-variance (PV) aberration, introduced by J.
P. Morgan for affine resolvable designs, and determine the uniform $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin
squares with minimum PV aberration when there exist $n-1$ mutually orthogonal Latin squares of
order $n$. These do not exist when $n=6$, and the smallest uniform semi-Latin squares in this case
have size $(6\times 6)/10$. We present a complete classification of the uniform $(6\times 6)/10$
semi-Latin squares, and display (the dual of) the one with least PV aberration. We give a construction
producing a uniform $((n+1)\times (n+1))/((n-2)n)$ semi-Latin square when there exist $n-1$
mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$, and determine the PV aberration of such a uniform
semi-Latin square. Finally, we describe how certain affine resolvable designs and balanced incomplete-block
designs can be constructed from uniform semi-Latin squares, and from the uniform $(6\times 6)/10$
semi-Latin squares classified, we obtain many affine resolvable designs for 72 treatments in 36
blocks of size 12, as well as new balanced incomplete-block designs for 36 treatments in 84 blocks
of size 6.
