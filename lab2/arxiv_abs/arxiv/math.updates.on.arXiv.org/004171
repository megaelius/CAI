A dagger category is a category equipped with a functorial way of reversing morphisms, i.e. a contravariant
involutive identity-on-objects endofunctor. Dagger categories with additional structure have
been studied under different names e.g. in categorical quantum mechanics and algebraic field theory.
In this thesis we study the dagger in its own right and show how basic category theory adapts to dagger
categories. We develop a notion of a dagger limit that we show is suitable in the following ways: it
subsumes special cases known from the literature; dagger limits are unique up to unitary isomorphism;
a wide class of dagger limits can be built from a small selection of them; dagger limits of a fixed shape
can be phrased as dagger adjoints to a diagonal functor; dagger limits can be built from ordinary
limits in the presence of polar decomposition; dagger limits commute with dagger colimits in many
cases. Using cofree dagger categories, the theory of dagger limits can be leveraged to provide an
enrichment-free understanding of limit-colimit coincidences in ordinary category theory. We
formalize the concept of an ambilimit, and show that it captures known cases. As a special case, we
show how to define biproducts up to isomorphism in an arbitrary category without assuming any enrichment.
Moreover, the limit-colimit coincidence from domain theory can be generalized to the unenriched
setting and we show that, under suitable assumptions, a wide class of endofunctors has canonical
fixed points. The theory of monads on dagger categories works best when all structure respects the
dagger: the monad and adjunctions should preserve the dagger, and the monad and its algebras should
satisfy the so-called Frobenius law. Then any monad resolves as an adjunction, with extremal solutions
given by the categories of Kleisli and Frobenius-Eilenberg-Moore algebras, which again have a
dagger.
