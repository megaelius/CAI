The standard Feynman diagrammatic approach to quantum field theories assumes that perturbation
theory approximates the full quantum theory at small coupling even when a mathematically rigorous
construction of the latter is absent. On the other hand, two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory is a
rare (if not the only) example of a nonabelian (pure) gauge theory whose full quantum theory has a
rigorous construction. Indeed, the theory can be formulated via a lattice approximation, from
which Wilson loop expecation values in the continuum limit can be described in terms of heat kernels
on the gauge group. It is therefore fundamental to investigate how the exact answer for 2D Yang-Mills
compares with that of the continuum perturbative approach, which a priori are unrelated. In this
paper, we provide a mathematically rigorous formulation of the perturbative quantization of 2D
Yang-Mills, and we consider perturbative Wilson loop expectation values on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and
$S^2$ in Coulomb gauge, holomorphic gauge, and axial gauge (on $\mathbb{R}^2$). We show the following
equivalences and nonequivalences between these gauges: (i) Coulomb and holomorphic gauge are
equivalent and are independent of the choice of gauge-fixing metric; (ii) both are inequivalent
with axial-gauge. Additionally, we show that the asymptotics of exact lattice Wilson loop expectations
on $S^2$ agree with perturbatively computed expectations in holomorphic gauge for simple closed
curves to all orders. However, as a consequence of (ii), this result is necessarily false on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Our work therefore presents fundamental progress in the analysis of how continuum perturbation
theory succeeds or fails in capturing the asymptotics of the continuum limit of the lattice theory.
