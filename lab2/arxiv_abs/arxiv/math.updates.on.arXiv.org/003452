In 1948 Feynman introduced functional integration. Long ago the problematic aspect of measures
in the space of fields was overcome with the introduction of volume elements in Probability Space,
leading to stochastic formulations. More recently Cartier and DeWitt-Morette focused on the definition
of a proper integration measure and established a rigorous mathematical formulation of functional
integration. Their central observation relates to the distributional nature of fields, for it
leads to the identification of distribution functionals with Schwartz space test functions as
density measures. This is just the mathematical content of the Taylor-Lagrange Scheme developed
by the authors in a recent past. In this scheme fields are living in metric Schwartz-Sobolev spaces,
subject to open coverings with subordinate partition-of-unity test functions. In effect these
PU, through the convolution operation, lead to smooth field functions on an extended Schwartz space.
In this way the basic assumption of differential geometry -- that fields live on differentiable
manifolds -- is validated. Next it is shown that convolution in the theory of distributions leads
to a sound definition of Laplace-Stieltjes transforms , stemming from the existence of an isometry
invariant Hausdorff measure in the space of fields. Turning to gauge theories the construction
of smooth vector fields on a curved manifold is established, as required for differentiable vector
fibre bundles. The proper choice of a connection further separates in the functional Hausdorff
integration measure a finite Gaussian integration over the gauge parameter which factors out and
plays no physical role. For non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories the properties of Vilkowisky-DeWitt's
connection and of Landau-DeWitt's covariant back-ground gauge result in very simple calculation
rules.
