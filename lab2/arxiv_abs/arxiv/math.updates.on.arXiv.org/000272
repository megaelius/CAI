Higher order digital nets have recently been recognized as one of the most promising branches of
quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The notable feature of higher order digital nets is that they can exploit
the smoothness of a function for numerical integration and achieve an improved convergence rate
of the integration error for smooth functions. One prominent construction of such nets is based
on digitally interlacing the components of the classical digital net whose number of components
is a multiple $d$ of the dimension. In this study we consider the weighted unanchored Sobolev spaces
of smoothness $\alpha \ge 2$, and derive an upper bound on the mean square worst-case error for digitally
shifted higher order digital nets. Employing our obtained bound as a quality criterion, we prove
that the component-by-component construction can be made efficient use of to obtain good polynomial
lattice point sets that are used for interlaced components. Through this approach we are able to
get some tractability results under certain conditions on the weights. Fast construction using
the fast Fourier transform requires the construction cost of order $O(sdN \log N)$ operations using
O(N) memory, where $N$ is the number of points and $s$ is the dimension, which is a significant reduction
in the construction cost as compared to higher order polynomial lattice rules. Numerical experiments
confirm that the performance of our constructed point sets often outperforms in terms of our introduced
quality criterion the performances of higher order digital nets with Sobol' sequences and Niederreiter-Xing
sequences used as interlaced components, indicating the usefulness of our algorithm.
