We consider a biphasic continuum model for avascular tumour growth in two spatial dimensions, in
which a cell phase and a fluid phase follow conservation of mass and momentum. A limiting nutrient
that follows a diffusion process controls the birth and death rate of the tumour cells. The cell volume
fraction, cell velocity - fluid pressure system, and nutrient concentration are the model variables.
A coupled system of a hyperbolic conservation law, a viscoelastic system, and a parabolic diffusion
equation governs the dynamics of the model variables. The tumour boundary moves with the normal
velocity of the outermost layer of cells, and this time-dependence is a challenge in designing and
implementing a stable and fast numerical scheme. We recast the model into a form where the hyperbolic
equation is defined on a fixed extended domain and retrieve the tumour boundary as the interface
at which the cell volume fraction decreases below a threshold value. This procedure eliminates
the need to track the tumour boundary explicitly and the computationally expensive re-meshing
of the time-dependent domains. A numerical scheme based on finite volume methods for the hyperbolic
conservation law, Lagrange $\mathbb{P}_2 - \mathbb{P}_1$ Taylor-Hood finite element method
for the viscoelastic system, and mass-lumped finite element method for the parabolic equations
is implemented in two spatial dimensions, and several cases are studied. We demonstrate the versatility
of the numerical scheme in catering for irregular and asymmetric initial tumour geometries. When
the nutrient diffusion equation is defined only in the tumour region, the model depicts growth in
free suspension. On the contrary, when the nutrient diffusion equation is defined in a larger fixed
domain, the model depicts tumour growth in a polymeric gel.
