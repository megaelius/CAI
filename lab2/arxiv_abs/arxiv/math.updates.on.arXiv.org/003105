We prove a structure theorem for any $n$-rectifiable set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n\ge 1$,
satisfying a weak version of the lower ADR condition, and having locally finite $H^n$ ($n$-dimensional
Hausdorff) measure. Namely, that $H^n$-almost all of $E$ can be covered by a countable union of boundaries
of bounded Lipschitz domains contained in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus E$. As a consequence, for
harmonic measure in the complement of such a set $E$, we establish a non-degeneracy condition which
amounts to saying that $H^n|_E$ is "absolutely continuous" with respect to harmonic measure in
the sense that any Borel subset of $E$ with strictly positive $H^n$ measure has strictly positive
harmonic measure in some connected component of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus E$. We also provide
some counterexamples showing that our result for harmonic measure is optimal. Moreover, we show
that if, in addition, a set $E$ as above is the boundary of a connected domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$
which satisfies an infinitesimal interior thickness condition, then $H^n|_{\partial\Omega}$
is absolutely continuous (in the usual sense) with respect to harmonic measure for $\Omega$. Local
versions of these results are also proved: if just some piece of the boundary is $n$-rectifiable
then we get the corresponding absolute continuity on that piece. As a consequence of this and recent
results by Azzam-Hofmann-Martell-Mayboroda-Mourgoglou-Tolsa-Volberg, we can decompose the
boundary of any open connected set satisfying the previous conditions in two disjoint pieces: one
that is $n$-rectifiable where Hausdorff measure is absolutely continuous with respect to harmonic
measure and another purely $n$-unrectifiable piece having vanishing harmonic measure.
