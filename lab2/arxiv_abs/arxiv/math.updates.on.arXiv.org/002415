We present an adaptive grid matrix-free operator approximation scheme based on a "product-convolution"
interpolation of convolution operators. This scheme is appropriate for operators that are locally
approximately translation-invariant, even if these operators are high-rank or full-rank. Such
operators arise in Schur complement methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs),
as Hessians in PDE-constrained optimization and inverse problems, as integral operators, as covariance
operators, and as Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. Constructing the approximation requires computing
the impulse responses of the operator to delta function sources centered on nodes in an adaptively
refined grid of sample points. A randomized a-posteriori error estimator drives the adaptivity.
Once constructed, the approximation can be efficiently applied to vectors using the fast Fourier
transform (FFT), and used in place of the operator. The approximation can also be efficiently converted
to hierarchical matrix (H-matrix) format, then inverted or factorized using scalable H-matrix
arithmetic. The quality of the approximation degrades gracefully as fewer sample points are used,
allowing cheap lower quality approximations to be used as preconditioners. We directly address
issues related to boundaries and prove that our scheme eliminates boundary artifacts. We test the
scheme on the non-local component of a boundary Schur complement for the Poisson operator, and on
the data misfit Hessian for an advection dominated advection-diffusion inverse problem. Numerical
results show that the number of sample points required is independent of the mesh size for the non-local
component of the Poisson Schur complement, and independent of the informativeness of the data for
the advection-diffusion inverse problem data misfit Hessian.
