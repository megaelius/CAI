Let $M$ be a compact connected complex manifold and $G$ a connected reductive complex affine algebraic
group. Let $E_G$ be a holomorphic principal $G$--bundle over $M$ and $T\, \subset\, G$ a torus containing
the connected component of the center of $G$. Let $N$ (respectively, $C$) be the normalizer (respectively,
centralizer) of $T$ in $G$, and let $W$ be the Weyl group $N/C$ for $T$. We prove that there is a natural
bijective correspondence between the following two: Torus subbundles $\mathbb T$ of ${\rm Ad}(E_G)$
such that for some (hence every) $x\, \in\, M$, the fiber ${\mathbb T}_x$ lies in the conjugacy class
of tori in ${\rm Ad}(E_G)$ determined by $T$. Quadruples of the form $(E_W,\, \phi,\, E'_C,\, \tau)$,
where $\phi\, :\, E_W\, \longrightarrow\, M$ is a principal $W$--bundle, $\phi^*E_G\, \supset\,
E'_C\, \stackrel{\psi}{\longrightarrow}\, E_W$ is a holomorphic reduction of structure group
of $\phi^* E_G$ to $C$, and $$ \tau\,:\, E'_C\times N \, \longrightarrow\, E'_C $$ is a holomorphic
action of $N$ on $E'_C$ extending the natural action of $C$ on $E'_C$, such that the composition $\psi\circ\tau$
coincides with the composition of the quotient map $E'_C\times N\, \longrightarrow\, (E'_C/C)\times
(N/C)\,=\, (E'_C\times N)/(C\times C)$ with the natural map $(E'_C/C)\times (N/C)\, \longrightarrow\,
E_W$. The composition of maps $E'_C\, \longrightarrow\, E_W \, \longrightarrow\, M$ defines a
principal $N$--bundle on $M$. This principal $N$--bundle $E_N$ is a reduction of structure group
of $E_G$ to $N$. Given a complex connection $\nabla$ on $E_G$, we give a necessary and sufficient
condition for $\nabla$ to be induced by a connection on $E_N$. This criterion relates Hermitian--Einstein
connections on $E_G$ and $E'_C$ in a very precise manner.
