In a section of the review paper [Pirandola et al., arXiv:1711.09909v1] we have discussed several
mathematical mistakes which were made by WTB [arXiv:1602.08898v1] in their derivations of the
strong converse bounds for Gaussian channels. In these derivations there is no energy constraint
enforced on the input alphabet, nor any discussion on the order of the limits between the energy of
the input state and the squeezing of the resource state for teleportation. As a consequence, the
Braunstein-Kimble protocol inevitably leads to unbounded results. We have also discussed the
complete absence of a peeling argument which is crucial for simplifying adaptive protocols and
correctly propagating the error associated with the channel simulation. Because of the absence
of this argument, the bounds presented in WTB do not apply to adaptive protocols and therefore two-way
assisted capacities. Here we briefly confirm these points and also discuss how basic misinterpretations
of previous literature have led this author to these technical errors. This document is in reply
to various comments written by this author. More specifically, we start by demystifying the arguments
in the first comment [Wilde, arXiv:1712.00145v1], where he incorrectly claims to have used energy
constraints in his derivations. Then we address the second comment [Wilde, arXiv:1712.00145v2],
where this author changes his strategy and admits the issues related with the unboundedness of the
input alphabet. He then argues about the strong convergence topology as a possible way to fix the
error. Unfortunately, not only this convergence was not discussed in WTB but its formulation for
adaptive protocols was also completely missing. In the third comment [Wilde, arXiv:1712.00145v3],
the author finally includes the peeling of the adaptive protocols, therefore confirming the severe
lack of rigor in his previous derivations.
