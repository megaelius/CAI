Many fundamental questions in additive number theory (such as Goldbach's conjecture, Fermat's
last theorem, and the Twin Primes conjecture) can be expressed in the language of sum and difference
sets. As a typical pair of elements contributes one sum and two differences, we expect that $|A-A|
> |A+A|$ for a finite set $A$. However, in 2006 Martin and O'Bryant showed that a positive proportion
of subsets of $\{0, \dots, n\}$ are sum-dominant, and Zhao later showed that this proportion converges
to a positive limit as $n \to \infty$. Related problems, such as constructing explicit families
of sum-dominant sets, computing the value of the limiting proportion, and investigating the behavior
as the probability of including a given element in $A$ to go to zero, have been analyzed extensively.
We consider many of these problems in a more general setting. Instead of just one set $A$, we study
sums and differences of pairs of \emph{correlated} sets $(A,B)$. Specifically, we place each element
$a \in \{0,\dots, n\}$ in $A$ with probability $p$, while $a$ goes in $B$ with probability $\rho_1$
if $a \in A$ and probability $\rho_2$ if $a \not \in A$. If $|A+B| > |(A-B) \cup (B-A)|$, we call
the pair $(A,B)$ a \emph{sum-dominant $(p,\rho_1, \rho_2)$-pair}. We prove that for any fixed
$\vec{\rho}=(p, \rho_1, \rho_2)$ in $(0,1)^3$, $(A,B)$ is a sum-dominant $(p,\rho_1, \rho_2)$-pair
with positive probability, and show that this probability approaches a limit $P(\vec{\rho})$.
Furthermore, we show that the limit function $P(\vec{\rho})$ is continuous. We also investigate
what happens as $p$ decays with $n$, generalizing results of Hegarty-Miller on phase transitions.
Finally, we find the smallest sizes of MSTD pairs.
