In recent years, there has been great interest in the study of categorification, specifically as
it applies to the theory of quantum groups. In this thesis, we would like to provide a new approach
to this problem by looking at Hall algebras. It is know, due to Ringel, that a Hall algebra is isomorphic
to a certain quantum group. It is our goal to describe a categorification of Hall algebras as a way
of doing so for their related quantum groups. To do this, we will take the following steps. First,
we describe a new perspective on the structure theory of Hall algebras. This view solves, in a unique
way, the classic problem of the multiplication and comultiplication not being compatible. Our
solution is to switch to a different underlying category $\Vect^K$ of vector spaces graded by a group
$K$ called the Grothendieck group. We equip this category with a nontrivial braiding which depends
on the $K$-grading. With this braiding and a given antipode, we find that the Hall algebra does become
a Hopf algebra object in $\Vect^K$. Second, we will describe a categorification process, call `groupoidification',
which replaces vector spaces with groupoids and linear operators with `spans' of groupoids. We
will use this process to construct a braided monoidal bicategory which categorifies $\Vect^K$
via the groupoidification program. Specifically, graded vector spaces will be replaced with groupoids
`over' a fixed groupoid related to the Grothendieck group $K$. The braiding structure will come
from an interesting groupoid $\EXT(M,N)$ which will behave like the Euler characteristic for the
Grothendieck group $K$. We will finish with a description of our plan to, in future work, apply the
same concept to the structure maps of the Hall algebra, which will eventually give us a Hopf 2-algebra
object in our braided monoidal bicategory.
