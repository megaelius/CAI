We prove that square-tiled surfaces having fixed combinatorics of horizontal cylinder decomposition
and tiled with smaller and smaller squares become asymptotically equidistributed in any ambient
linear $GL(\mathbb R)$-invariant suborbifold defined over $\mathbb Q$ in the moduli space of Abelian
differentials. Moreover, we prove that the combinatorics of the horizontal and of the vertical
decompositions are asymptotically uncorrelated. As a consequence, we prove the existence of an
asymptotic distribution for the combinatorics of a "random" interval exchange transformation
with integer lengths. We compute explicitly the absolute contribution of square-tiled surfaces
having a single horizontal cylinder to the Masur-Veech volume of any ambient stratum of Abelian
differentials. The resulting count is particularly simple and efficient in the large genus asymptotics.
We conjecture that the corresponding relative contribution is asymptotically of the order $1/d$,
where $d$ is the dimension of the stratum, and prove that this conjecture is equivalent to the long-standing
conjecture on the large genus asymptotics of the Masur-Veech volumes. We prove, in particular,
that the recent results of Chen, M\"oller and Zagier imply that the conjecture holds for the principal
stratum of Abelian differentials as the genus tends to infinity. Our result on random interval exchanges
with integer lengths allows to make empirical computation of the probability to get a $1$-cylinder
pillowcase cover taking a "random" one in a given stratum. We use this technique to derive the approximate
values of the Masur-Veech volumes of strata of quadratic differentials of all small dimensions.
