With the help of a logarithmic barrier augmented Lagrangian function, we can obtain closed-form
solutions of slack variables of logarithmic-barrier problems of nonlinear programs. As a result,
a two-parameter primal-dual nonlinear system is proposed, which corresponds to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
point and the infeasible stationary point of nonlinear programs, respectively, as one of two parameters
vanishes. Based on this distinctive system, we present a primal-dual interior-point method capable
of rapidly detecting infeasibility of nonlinear programs. The method generates interior-point
iterates without truncation of the step. It is proved that our method converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
point of the original problem as the barrier parameter tends to zero. Otherwise, the scaling parameter
tends to zero, and the method converges to either an infeasible stationary point or a singular stationary
point of the original problem. Moreover, our method has the capability to rapidly detect the infeasibility
of the problem. Under suitable conditions, not only the method can be superlinearly or quadratically
convergent to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point as the original problem is feasible, but also it can
be superlinearly or quadratically convergent to the infeasible stationary point when a problem
is infeasible. Preliminary numerical results show that the method is efficient in solving some
simple but hard problems and some standard test problems from the CUTE collection, where the superlinear
convergence is demonstrated when we solve two infeasible problems and one well-posed feasible
counterexample presented in the literature.
