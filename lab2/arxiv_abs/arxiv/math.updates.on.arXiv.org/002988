We first seek the rebit-retrit counterpart to the (formally proven by Lovas and Andai) two-rebit
Hilbert-Schmidt separability probability of $\frac{29}{64} =\frac{29}{2^6} \approx 0.453125$
and the qubit-qutrit analogue of the (strongly supported) value of $\frac{8}{33} = \frac{2^3}{3
\cdot 11} \approx 0.242424$. We advance the possibilities of a rebit-retrit value of $\frac{860}{6561}
=\frac{2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 43}{3^8} \approx 0.131078$ and a qubit-qutrit one of $\frac{27}{1000}
= (\frac{3}{10})^3 =\frac{3^3}{2^3 \cdot 5^3} = 0.027$. These four values for $2 \times m$ systems
($m=2,3$) suggest certain numerator/denominator sequences involving powers of $m$, which we
further investigate for $m>3$. Additionally, we find that the Hilbert-Schmidt separability/PPT-probabilities
for the two-rebit, rebit-retrit and two-retrit $X$-states all equal $\frac{16}{3 \pi^2} \approx
0.54038$, as well as more generally, that the probabilities based on induced measures are equal
across these three sets. Then, we extend the master Lovas-Andai formula to induced measures. For
instance, the two-qubit function ($k=0$) is $\tilde{\chi}_{2,0}(\varepsilon)=\frac{1}{3}
\varepsilon^2 (4 -\varepsilon^2)$, yielding $\frac{8}{33}$, while its $k=1$ induced measure
counterpart is $\tilde{\chi}_{2,1}(\varepsilon)=\frac{1}{4} \varepsilon ^2 \left(3-\varepsilon
^2\right)^2$, yielding $\frac{61}{143} =\frac{61}{11 \cdot 13} \approx 0.426573$, where $\varepsilon$
is a singular-value ratio. Interpolations between Hilbert-Schmidt and operator monotone (Bures,
$\sqrt{x}$) measures are also studied. Using a recently-developed golden-ratio-related (quasirandom
sequence) approach, current (significant digits) estimates of the two-rebit and two-qubit Bures
separability probabilities are 0.15709 and 0.07331, respectively.
