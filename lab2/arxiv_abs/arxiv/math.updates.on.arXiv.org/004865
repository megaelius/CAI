Load side participation can provide valuable support to the power network in case of urgencies.
On many occasions, loads are naturally represented by on and off states. However, the use of on-off
loads for frequency control can lead to chattering and undesirable limit cycle behavior, which
are issues that need to be resolved for such loads to be used for network support. This paper considers
the problem of primary frequency regulation with ancillary service from on-off loads in power networks
and establishes conditions that lead to convergence guarantees and an appropriate power allocation
within the network. In particular, in order to assist existing frequency control mechanisms, we
consider loads that switch when prescribed frequency thresholds are exceeded. Such control policies
are prone to chattering, which limits their practicality. To resolve this issue, we consider loads
that follow a decentralized hysteretic on-off policy, and show that chattering is not observed
within such a setting. Hysteretic loads may exhibit, however, limit cycle behavior, which is undesirable.
To address this, we propose an adapted hysteretic control scheme for which we provide convergence
guarantees. Furthermore, we consider a mixed-integer optimization problem for power allocation
and propose a suitable design of the control policy such that the cost incurred at equilibrium is
within $\epsilon$ from the optimal cost, providing a non conservative value for $\epsilon$. The
practicality of our analytic results is demonstrated with numerical simulations on the Northeast
Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 140-bus system.
