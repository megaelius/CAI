Contact Tracing (CT) is one of the measures taken by government and health officials to mitigate
the spread of the novel coronavirus. In this paper, we investigate its efficacy by developing a compartmental
model for assessing its impact on mitigating the spread of the virus. We describe the impact on the
reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_c$ of Covid-19. In particular, we discuss the importance and
relevance of parameters of the model such as the number of reported cases, effectiveness of tracking
and monitoring policy, and the transmission rates to contact tracing. We describe the terms ``perfect
tracking'', ``perfect monitoring'' and ``perfect reporting'' to indicate that traced contacts
will be tracked while incubating, tracked contacts are efficiently monitored so that they do not
cause secondary infections, and all infected persons are reported, respectively. We consider
three special scenarios: (1) perfect monitoring and perfect tracking of contacts of a reported
case, (2) perfect reporting of cases and perfect monitoring of tracked reported cases and (3) perfect
reporting and perfect tracking of contacts of reported cases. Furthermore, we gave a lower bound
on the proportion of contacts to be traced to ensure that the effective reproduction, $\mathcal{R}_c$,
is below one and describe $\mathcal{R}_c$ in terms of observable quantities such as the proportion
of reported and traced cases. Model simulations using the Covid-19 data obtained from John Hopkins
University for some selected states in the US suggest that even late intervention of CT may reasonably
reduce the transmission of Covid-19 and reduce peak hospitalizations and deaths. In particular,
our findings suggest that effective monitoring policy of tracked cases and tracking of traced contacts
while incubating are more crucial than tracing more contacts.
