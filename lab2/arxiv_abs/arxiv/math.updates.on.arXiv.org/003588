According to the wave power rule, the second derivative of a function with respect to the variable
t is equal to negative n times the function raised to the power of 2n-1. Solving the ordinary differential
equations numerically results in waves appearing in the figures. The ordinary differential equation
is very simple; however, waves, including the regular amplitude and period, are drawn in the figure.
In this study, the function for obtaining the wave is called the leaf function. Based on the leaf function,
the exact solutions for the undamped and unforced Duffing equations are presented. In the ordinary
differential equation, in the positive region of the variable, the second derivative becomes negative.
Therefore, in the case that the curves vary with the time under the condition x(t)>0, the gradient
constantly decreases as time increases. That is, the tangential vector on the curve of the graph
changes from the upper right direction to the lower right direction as time increases. On the other
hand, in the negative region of the variable, the second derivative becomes positive. The gradient
constantly increases as time decreases. That is, the tangent vector on the curve changes from the
lower right direction to the upper right direction as time increases. Since the behavior occurring
in the positive region of the variable and the behavior occurring in the negative region of the variable
alternately occur in regular intervals, waves appear by these interactions. In this paper, I present
seven types of damped and divergence exact solutions by combining trigonometric functions, hyperbolic
functions, hyperbolic leaf functions, leaf functions, and exponential functions. In each type,
I show the derivation method and numerical examples, as well as describe the features of the waveform.
