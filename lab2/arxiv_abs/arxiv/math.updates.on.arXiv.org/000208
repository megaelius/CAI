A lattice model of critical dense polymers is solved exactly for arbitrary system size on the torus.
More generally, an infinite family of lattice loop models is studied on the torus and related to the
corresponding Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster models. Starting with a cylinder, the commuting
periodic single-row transfer matrices are built from the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra extended
by the shift operators Omega and Omega^{-1}. In this enlarged algebra, the non-contractible loop
fugacity is alpha and the contractible loop fugacity is beta. The torus is formed by gluing the top
and bottom of the cylinder. This gives rise to a variety of non-contractible loops winding around
the torus. Because of their nonlocal nature, the standard matrix trace does not produce the proper
geometric torus. Instead, we introduce a modified matrix trace for this purpose. This is achieved
by using a representation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra with a parameter v that
keeps track of the winding of defects on the cylinder. The transfer matrix representatives and their
eigenvalues thus depend on v. The modified trace is constructed as a linear functional on planar
connectivity diagrams in terms of matrix traces Tr_d (with a fixed number of defects d) and Chebyshev
polynomials of the first kind. For critical dense polymers, where beta=0, the transfer matrix eigenvalues
are obtained by solving a functional equation in the form of an inversion identity. The solution
depends on d and is subject to selection rules which we prove. Simplifications occur if all non-contractible
loop fugacities are set to alpha=2 in which case the traces are evaluated at v=1. In the continuum
scaling limit, the corresponding conformal torus partition function obtained from finite-size
corrections agrees with the known modular invariant partition function of symplectic fermions.
