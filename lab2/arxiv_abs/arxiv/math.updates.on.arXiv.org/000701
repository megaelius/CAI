Let $\mathbf{R}$ be a real closed field. The problem of obtaining tight bounds on the Betti numbers
of semi-algebraic subsets of $\mathbf{R}^k$ in terms of the number and degrees of the defining polynomials
has been an important problem in real algebraic geometry with the first results due to Ole{\u\i}nik
and Petrovski{\u\i}, Thom and Milnor. These bounds are all exponential in the number of variables
$k$. Motivated by several applications in real algebraic geometry, as well as in theoretical computer
science, where such bounds have found applications, we consider in this paper the problem of bounding
the \emph{equivariant} Betti numbers of symmetric algebraic and semi-algebraic subsets of $\mathbf{R}^k$.
We obtain several asymptotically tight upper bounds. In particular, we prove that if $S\subset
\mathbf{R}^k$ is a semi-algebraic subset defined by a finite set of $s$ symmetric polynomials of
degree at most $d$, then the sum of the $\mathfrak{S}_k$-equivariant Betti numbers of $S$ with coefficients
in $\mathbb{Q}$ is bounded by $(skd)^{O(d)}$. As an application we improve the best known bound
on the ordinary Betti numbers of the projection of a compact semi-algebraic set improving for any
fixed degree the best previously known bound for this problem due to Gabrielov, Vorobjov and Zell.
As another application of our methods we obtain polynomial time (for fixed degrees) algorithms
for computing the generalized Euler-Poincar{\'e} characteristic of semi-algebraic sets defined
by symmetric polynomials. This is in contrast to the best complexity of the known algorithms for
the same problem in the non-symmetric situation, which is singly exponential. This singly exponential
complexity for the latter problem is unlikely to be improved because of hardness result ($\#\mathbf{P}$-hardness)
coming from discrete complexity theory.
