The goal of this paper is to construct a calculus whose higher indices are naturally elements in the
twisted K-theory groups for Lie groupoids. Given a Lie groupoid $G$ and a $PU(H)$-valued groupoid
cocycle, we construct an algebra of projective pseudodifferential operators. The subalgebra
of regularizing operators identifies with the naturally associated smooth convolution algebra
of the associated twisted gerbe. We develop the associated symbolic calculus, symbol short exact
sequences and existence of parametrices. In particular the algebra of projective operators appears
as a quantization of the twisted symbol algebra. As the (untwisted) Lie groupoid case that it encompasses,
the negative order operators extend to the twisted $C^*$-algebra and the zero order operators act
as bounded multipliers on it. We obtain an analytic index morphism in twisted K-theory associated
in a classic way by the corresponding pseudodifferential extension. We prove that this index morphism
only depends on the isomorphism class of the cocycle, {\it i.e.,} on the twisting as the associated
class in $H^1(G;PU(H))$. We also show that this twisted analytic index morphism is compatible with
the index we constructed in a previous work, in collaboration with Bai-Ling Wang, by means of the
Connes tangent groupoid, obtaining as a consequence the analytic interpretation, in terms of projective
pseudodifferential operators and ellipticity, of the twisted longitudinal Connes-Skandalis
index theorem. Our construction encompasses and unifies several previous cases treated in the
literature, we discuss in the final section some examples of classes of operators unified by our
setting.
