Suppose that a rumor, which originates from a single node among a set of suspect nodes in a network,
is spreading across the network following the susceptible-infected (SI) model, how can we and how
well can we identify this rumor source? With the {\it a priori} knowledge of the set of suspect nodes
and a snapshot observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum {\it a posteriori} (MAP) estimator
to identify the rumor source. For regular tree-type networks with node degree $\delta$, we characterize
$\mathbf{P_c}(n)$, the correct detection probability of the source estimator upon observing
$n$ infected nodes, in both the finite and asymptotic regimes. First, when every infected node belongs
to the suspect set, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\mathbf{P_c}(n)$ grows from 0.25 to 0.307 as $\delta$
increases from three to infinity, a result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a
different approach; and $\mathbf{P_c}(n)$ decreases with $n$ and increases with $\delta$. Second,
when the suspect nodes form a connected subgraph of the network, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\mathbf{P_c}(n)$
significantly exceeds the {\it a priori} probability if $\delta \geq 3$, and reliable detection
is achieved as $\delta$ becomes sufficiently large; and $\mathbf{P_c}(n)$ decreases with $n$
and increases with $\delta$. Third, when there are only two suspect nodes, $\lim_{n \rightarrow
\infty}\mathbf{P_c}(n)$ is at least 0.75 if $\delta \geq 3$; and $\mathbf{P_c}(n)$ increases
with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are multiple suspect nodes, the source
estimator has the worst detection probability when the suspects form a connected subgraph of the
network. Our analysis leverages ideas from the P\'{o}lya's urn model and sheds insight into the
behavior of the rumor spreading process.
