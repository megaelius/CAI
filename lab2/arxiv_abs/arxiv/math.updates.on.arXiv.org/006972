We propose an unconditionally robust and highly effective preconditioner for general symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices based on structured incomplete factorization (SIF), called
enhanced SIF (eSIF) preconditioner. The original SIF strategy proposed recently derives a structured
preconditioner by applying block diagonal preprocessing to the matrix and then compressing appropriate
scaled off-diagonal blocks. Here, we use an enhanced scaling-and-compression strategy to design
the new eSIF preconditioner. Some subtle modifications are made, such as the use of two-sided block
triangular preprocessing. A practical multilevel eSIF scheme is then designed. We give rigorous
analysis for both the enhanced scaling-and-compression strategy and the multilevel eSIF preconditioner.
The new eSIF framework has some significant advantages and overcomes some major limitations of
the SIF strategy. (i) With the same tolerance for compressing the off-diagonal blocks, the eSIF
preconditioner can approximate the original matrix to a much higher accuracy. (ii) The new preconditioner
leads to much more significant reductions of condition numbers due to an accelerated magnification
effect for the decay in the singular values of the scaled off-diagonal blocks. (iii) With the new
preconditioner, the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are much better clustered around
$1$. (iv) The multilevel eSIF preconditioner is further unconditionally robust or is guaranteed
to be positive definite without the need of extra stabilization, while the multilevel SIF preconditioner
has a strict requirement in order to preserve positive definiteness. Comprehensive numerical
tests are used to show the advantages of the eSIF preconditioner in accelerating the convergence
of iterative solutions.
