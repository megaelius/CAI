In this paper, we are concerned with the fractional and higher order H\'{e}non-Hardy type equations
\begin{equation*} (-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}u(x)=f(x,u(x)) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
\text{in} \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^{n}, \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^{n}_{+} \,\,\, \text{or} \,\,\, \Omega
\end{equation*} with $n\geq2$, $0<\alpha<2$ or $\alpha=2m$ with $1\leq m<\frac{n}{2}$. We first
consider the typical case $f(x,u)=|x|^{a}u^{p}$ with $a\in(-\alpha,\infty)$ and $0<p<p_{c}(a):=\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$.
By developing a method of scaling spheres, we prove Liouville theorems for nonnegative solutions
to the above H\'{e}non-Hardy equations and equivalent integral equations in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
and $\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$. Our results extend the known Liouville theorems for some especially
admissible subranges of $a$ and $1<p<\min\left\{\frac{n+\alpha+a}{n-\alpha},p_{c}(a)\right\}$
to the full range $a\in(-\alpha,\infty)$ and $p\in(0,p_{c}(a))$. When $a>0$, we covered the gap
$p\in\big[\frac{n+\alpha+a}{n-\alpha},p_{c}(a)\big)$. In particular, when $\alpha=2$,
our results give an affirmative answer to the conjecture posed by Phan and Souplet \cite{PS}. As
a consequence, we derive a priori estimates and existence of positive solutions to higher order
Lane-Emden equations in bounded domains for all $1<p<\frac{n+2m}{n-2m}$. Our theorems extend
the results in \cite{CFL,DPQ} remarkably to the maximal range of $p$. For bounded domains $\Omega$,
we also apply the method of scaling spheres to derive Liouville theorems for super-critical problems.
Extensions to PDEs and IEs with general nonlinearities $f(x,u)$ are also included (Theorem \ref{general}).
We believe the method of scaling spheres developed here can be applied to various fractional or higher
order problems without translation invariance or in the cases the method of moving planes in conjunction
with Kelvin transforms do not work.
