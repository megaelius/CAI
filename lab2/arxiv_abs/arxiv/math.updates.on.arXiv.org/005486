In this paper, the physical layer security of a dual-hop underlay uplink cognitive radio network
is investigated over Nakagami-m fading channels. Specifically, multiple secondary sources are
taking turns in accessing the licensed spectrum of the primary users and communicating with a multiantenna
secondary base station D through the aid of a multiantenna relay R in the presence of M eavesdroppers
that are also equipped with multiple antennas. Among the remaining nodes, one jammer is randomly
selected to transmit an artificial noise to disrupt all the eavesdroppers that are attempting to
intercept the communication of the legitimate links i.e., S-R and R-D. The received signals at each
node are combined using maximal-ratio combining. Secrecy analysis is provided by deriving closed-form
and asymptotic expressions for the secrecy outage probability. The impact of several key parameters
on the system's secrecy e.g., transmit power of the sources, number of eavesdroppers, maximum tolerated
interference power, and the number of diversity branches is investigated. Importantly, by considering
two scenarios, namely (i) absence and (ii) presence of a friendly jammer, new insights are obtained
for the considered communication system. Especially, we tend to answer to the following question:
Can better secrecy be achieved without jamming by considering a single antenna at eavesdroppers
and multiple-ones at the legitimate users (i.e., relay and end-user) rather than sending permanently
an artificial noise and considering that both the relay and the destination are equipped with a single
antenna, while multiple antennas are used by the eavesdroppers? The obtained results are corroborated
through Monte Carlo simulation and show that the system's security can be enhanced by adjusting
the aforementioned parameters.
