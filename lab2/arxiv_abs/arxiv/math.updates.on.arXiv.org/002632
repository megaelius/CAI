In this paper, the main objective is to generalize to the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg (with density
dependent viscosities satisfying the BD relation) and Euler-Korteweg systems a recent relative
entropy [proposed by D. Bresch, P. Noble and J.--P. Vila, (2016)] introduced for the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations with a linear density dependent shear viscosity and a zero bulk viscosity.
As a concrete application, this helps to justify mathematically the convergence between global
weak solutions of the quantum Navier-Stokes system [recently obtained simultaneously by I. Lacroix-Violet
and A. Vasseur (2017)] and dissipative solutions of the quantum Euler system when the viscosity
coefficient tends to zero: This selects a dissipative solution as the limit of a viscous system.
We also get weak-strong uniqueness for the Quantum-Euler and for the Quantum-Navier-Stokes equations.
Our results are based on the fact that Euler-Korteweg systems and corresponding Navier--Stokes-Korteweg
systems can be reformulated through an augmented system such as the compressible Navier-Stokes
system with density dependent viscosities satisfying the BD algebraic relation. This was also
observed recently [by D. Bresch, F. Couderc, P. Noble and J.--P. Vila, (2016)] for the Euler-Korteweg
system for numerical purposes. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that this augmented formulation
helps to define relative entropy estimates for the Euler Korteweg systems in a simplest way compared
to recent works [See D. Donatelli, E. Feireisl, P. Marcati (2015) and J. Giesselmann, C. Lattanzio,
A.-E. Tzavaras (2017)] with less hypothesis required on the capillary coefficient.
