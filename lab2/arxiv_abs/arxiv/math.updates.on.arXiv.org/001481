Using a network of cache enabled small cells, traffic during peak hours can be reduced considerably
through proactively fetching the content that is most probable to be requested. In this paper, we
aim at exploring the impact of proactive caching on an important metric for future generation networks,
namely, energy efficiency (EE). We argue that, exploiting the correlation in user content popularity
profiles in addition to the spatial repartitions of users with comparable request patterns, can
result in considerably improving the achievable energy efficiency of the network. In this paper,
the problem of optimizing EE is decoupled into two related subproblems. The first one addresses
the issue of content popularity modeling. While most existing works assume similar popularity
profiles for all users in the network, we consider an alternative caching framework in which, users
are clustered according to their content popularity profiles. In order to showcase the utility
of the proposed clustering scheme, we use a statistical model selection criterion, namely Akaike
information criterion (AIC). Using stochastic geometry, we derive a closed-form expression of
the achievable EE and we find the optimal active small cell density vector that maximizes it. The
second subproblem investigates the impact of exploiting the spatial repartitions of users with
comparable request patterns. After considering a snapshot of the network, we formulate a combinatorial
optimization problem that enables to optimize content placement such that the used transmission
power is minimized. Numerical results show that the clustering scheme enable to considerably improve
the cache hit probability and consequently the EE compared with an unclustered approach. Simulations
also show that the small base station allocation algorithm results in improving the energy efficiency
and hit probability.
