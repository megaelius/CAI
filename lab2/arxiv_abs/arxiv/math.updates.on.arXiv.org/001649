The aim of the work is to provide a stable method to get sharp bounds for Boltzmann and Landau operators
in weighted Sobolev spaces and in anisotropic spaces. All the sharp bounds are given for the original
Boltzmann and Landau operators. The sharpness means the lower and upper bounds for the operators
are consistent with the behavior of the linearized operators. Moreover, we make clear the difference
between the bounds for the original operators and those for the linearized ones. According to the
Bobylev's formula, we introduce two types of dyadic decompositions performed in both phase and
frequency spaces to make full use of the interaction and the cancellation. It allows us to see clearly
which part of the operator behaves like a Laplace type operator and which part is dominated by the
anisotropic structure. It is the key point to get the sharp bounds in weighted Sobolev spaces and
in anisotropic spaces. Based on the geometric structure of the elastic collision, we make a geometric
decomposition to capture the anisotropic structure of the collision operator. More precisely,
we make it explicit that the fractional Laplace-Beltrami operator really exists in the structure
of the collision operator. It enables us to derive the sharp bounds in anisotropic spaces and then
complete the entropy dissipation estimates. The structures mentioned above are so stable that
we can apply them to the rescaled Boltzmann collision operator in the process of the grazing collisions
limit. Then we get the sharp bounds for the Landau collision operator by passing to the limit. We remark
that our analysis used here will shed light on the investigation of the asymptotics from Boltzmann
equation to Landau equation.
