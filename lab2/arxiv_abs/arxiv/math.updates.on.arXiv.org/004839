Fundamental in matrix algebra and its applications, a \emph{generalized inverse} of a real matrix
A is a matrix H that satisfies the Moore-Penrose (M-P) property AHA=A. If H also satisfies HAH=H,
it is called a reflexive. We consider aspects of symmetry related to the calculation of a sparse reflexive
generalized inverse of A. As is common, we use (vector) 1-norm minimization for inducing sparsity
and for keeping the magnitude of entries under control. When A is symmetric, we may naturally desire
a symmetric H; while generally such a restriction on H may not lead to a 1-norm minimizing reflexive
generalized inverse. Letting the rank of A be r, and seeking a 1-norm minimizing symmetric reflexive
generalized inverse H, we give (i) a closed form when r=1, (ii) a closed form when r=2 and A is non-negative,
and (iii) an approximation algorithm for general r. Importantly, our symmetric reflexive generalized
inverse is structured and has guaranteed sparsity ($\le r^2$ nonzeros). Other aspects of symmetry
that we consider relate to the other two M-P properties: H is ah-symmetric if AH is symmetric, and
ha-symmetric if HA is symmetric. Here we do not assume that A is symmetric, and we do not impose symmetry
on H. Seeking a 1-norm minimizing ah-symmetric (or ha-symmetric) reflexive generalized inverse
H, we give (i) a closed form when r=1, (ii) a closed form when r=2 and A satisfies a technical condition,
and (iii) an approximation algorithm for general r. Importantly, our ah-symmetric (ha-symmetric)
reflexive generalized inverse is structured and has better guaranteed sparsity ($\le mr$ nonzeros)
than the 1-norm minimizing ah-symmetric (ha-symmetric) reflexive generalized inverse obtained
via linear programming.
