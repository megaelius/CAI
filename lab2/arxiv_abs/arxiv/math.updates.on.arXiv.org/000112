Oceanic tides have the potential to yield a vast amount of renewable energy. Tidal stream generation
is one of the key technologies for extracting and harnessing this potential. In order to extract
an economically useful amount of power, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in
an array. This naturally leads to the question of where these turbines should be placed within the
array area to extract the maximum possible power: the positioning of the turbines could significantly
influence the extracted power, and hence is of major economic interest. However, manual optimisation
is difficult due to legal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the
cubic dependence of the power on the flow speed. The novel contribution of this paper is the formulation
of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained by a physical model, which is then solved
using an efficient gradient-based optimisation algorithm. In each optimisation iteration, a
two-dimensional finite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the
current array configuration. The gradient of the power extracted with respect to the turbine positions
is then computed in a fraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated adjoint
equations. These equations propagate causality backwards through the computation, from the power
extracted back to all turbine positions. This yields the gradient at a cost independent of the number
of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application. The utility of the approach is demonstrated
by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised scenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256
turbines in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.
