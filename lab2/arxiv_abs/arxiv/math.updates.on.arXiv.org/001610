Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) are widely used for modeling of dynamical systems. The
difficulty in numerically solving a DAE is measured by its differentiation index. For highly accurate
simulation of dynamical systems, it is important to convert high index DAEs into low index DAEs.
Most of existing simulation software packages for dynamical systems are equipped with an index
reduction algorithm given by Mattsson and S\"{o}derlind. Unfortunately, this algorithm fails
if there are unlucky numerical cancellations. These numerical cancellations are often caused
by accurate numbers in structural equations. Distinguishing those accurate numbers from inaccurate
ones that represent physical characteristics, Murota and Iri introduced the notion of a mixed matrix
as a mathematical tool for faithful model description in structural approach to systems analysis.
For DAEs described with the use of mixed matrices, efficient algorithms to compute the index have
been developed by exploiting matroid theory. This paper presents an index reduction algorithm
for linear DAEs whose coefficient matrices are mixed matrices. Our algorithm detects numerical
cancellations between accurate numbers, and transforms a DAE into an equivalent DAE to which Mattsson-S\"{o}derlind's
algorithm is applicable. The algorithm is based on the combinatorial relaxation approach, which
is a framework to solve a linear algebraic problem by iteratively relaxing it into an efficiently
solvable combinatorial optimization problem. The algorithm relies not on symbolic manipulations
but on fast combinatorial algorithms on graphs and matroids. Our algorithm is expected to preserve
the sparsity of DAEs. We further provide an improved algorithm under an assumption based on dimensional
analysis of dynamical systems. Our algorithms can be applied to nonlinear DAEs by regarding nonlinear
terms as inaccurate numbers.
