The forward-backward operator splitting algorithm is one of the most important methods for solving
the optimization problem of the sum of two convex functions, where one is differentiable with a Lipschitz
continuous gradient and the other is possibly nonsmooth but proximable. It is convenient to solve
some optimization problems in the form of dual or primal-dual problems. Both methods are mature
in theory. In this paper, we construct several efficient first-order splitting algorithms for
solving a multi-block composite convex optimization problem. The objective function includes
a smooth function with a Lipschitz continuous gradient, a proximable convex function that may be
nonsmooth, and a finite sum of a composition of a proximable function and a bounded linear operator.
To solve such an optimization problem, we transform it into the sum of three convex functions by defining
an appropriate inner product space. On the basis of the dual forward-backward splitting algorithm
and the primal-dual forward-backward splitting algorithm, we develop several iterative algorithms
that involve only computing the gradient of the differentiable function and proximity operators
of related convex functions. These iterative algorithms are matrix-inversion-free and completely
splitting algorithms. Finally, we employ the proposed iterative algorithms to solve a regularized
general prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS) model that is derived from computed
tomography (CT) image reconstruction under sparse sampling of projection measurements. Numerical
results show that the proposed iterative algorithms outperform other algorithms.
