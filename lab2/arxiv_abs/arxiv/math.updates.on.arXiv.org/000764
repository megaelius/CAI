Random matrices in the large N expansion and the so-called double scaling limit can be used as toy
models for quantum gravity: 2D quantum gravity coupled to conformal matter. This has generated
a tremendous expansion of random matrix theory, tackled with increasingly sophisticated mathematical
methods and number of matrix models have been solved exactly. However, the somewhat paradoxical
situation is that either models can be solved exactly or little can be said. Since the solved models
display critical points and universal properties, it is tempting to use renormalization group
ideas to determine universal properties, without solving models explicitly. Initiated by Br\'ezin
and Zinn-Justin, the approach has led to encouraging results, first for matrix integrals and then
quantum mechanics with matrices, but has not yet become a universal tool as initially hoped. In particular,
general quantum field theories with matrix fields require more detailed investigations. To better
understand some of the encountered difficulties, we first apply analogous ideas to the simpler
O(N) symmetric vector models, models that can be solved quite generally in the large N limit. Unlike
other attempts, our method is a close extension of Br\'ezin and Zinn-Justin. Discussing vector
and matrix models with similar approximation scheme, we notice that in all cases (vector and matrix
integrals, vector and matrix path integrals in the local approximation), at leading order, non-trivial
fixed points satisfy the same universal algebraic equation, and this is the main result of this work.
However, its precise meaning and role have still to be better understood.
