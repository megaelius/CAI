Recently the rank-structured tensor approach suggested a progress in the numerical treatment
of the long-range electrostatic potentials in many-particle systems and the respective interaction
energy and forces [39,40,2]. In this paper, we outline the prospects for tensor-based numerical
modeling of the collective electrostatic potential on lattices and in many-particle systems of
general type. We generalize the approach initially introduced for the rank-structured grid-based
calculation of the collective potentials on 3D lattices [39] to the case of many-particle systems
with variable charges placed on $L^{\otimes d}$ lattices and discretized on fine $n^{\otimes d}$
Cartesian grids for arbitrary dimension $d$. As result, the interaction potential is represented
in a parametric low-rank canonical format in $O(d L n)$ complexity. The energy is then calculated
in $O(d L)$ operations. Electrostatics in large biomolecules is modeled by using the novel range-separated
(RS) tensor format [2], which maintains the long-range part of the 3D collective potential of the
many-body system represented on $n\times n \times n$ grid in a parametric low-rank form in $O(n)$-complexity.
We show that the force field can be easily recovered by using the already precomputed electric field
in the low-rank RS format. The RS tensor representation of the discretized Dirac delta [45] enables
the efficient energy preserving regularization scheme for solving the 3D elliptic PDEs with strongly
singular right-hand side arising in bio-sciences. We conclude that the rank-structured tensor-based
approximation techniques provide the promising numerical tools for applications to many-body
dynamics, protein docking and classification problems and for low-parametric interpolation
of scattered data in data science.
