This thesis presents new applications of Gale duality to the study of polytopes, point configurations
and oriented matroids with extremal combinatorial properties. The first part of the thesis explores
construction techniques for neighborly polytopes and oriented matroids. First, we provide a new
interpretation of Shemer's classical Sewing Construction for neighborly polytopes in terms of
lexicographic extensions of oriented matroids. This allows us to provide a simplified proof and
to generalize it to oriented matroids in two ways: the Extended Sewing Construction and the Gale
Sewing Construction. Estimating the number of polytopes constructed with the later, we can provide
new lower bounds for the number of combinatorial types of neighborly polytopes that even improve
the current best bounds for the number of polytopes. The combination of both new techniques also
allows us to construct many non-realizable neighborly oriented matroids. The degree of a point
configuration is the maximal codimension of its interior faces. The second part of the thesis presents
various results on the combinatorial structure of point configurations whose degree is small compared
to their dimension; specifically, those whose degree is smaller than [(d+1)/2], the degree of neighborly
polytopes. The study of this problem comes motivated by Ehrhart theory, where a notion equivalent
to the degree - for lattice polytopes - has been widely studied during the last years. In addition,
the study of the degree is also related to the Generalized Lower Bound Theorem for simplicial polytopes,
with Cayley polytopes and with Tverberg theory. Among other results, we present a complete combinatorial
classification for point configurations of degree 1. Moreover, we show combinatorial restrictions
for configurations of small degree in terms of the novel concepts of weak Cayley configurations
and codegree decompositions.
