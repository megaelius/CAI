The time fractional ODEs are equivalent to convolutional Volterra integral equations with completely
monotone kernels. We therefore introduce the concept of complete monotonicity-preserving ($\mathcal{CM}$-preserving)
numerical methods for fractional ODEs, in which the discrete convolutional kernels inherit the
$\mathcal{CM}$ property as the continuous equations. We prove that $\mathcal{CM}$-preserving
schemes are at least $A(\pi/2)$ stable and can preserve the monotonicity of solutions to scalar
nonlinear autonomous fractional ODEs, both of which are novel. Significantly, by improving a result
of Li and Liu (Quart. Appl. Math., 76(1):189-198, 2018), we show that the $\mathcal{L}$1 scheme
is $\mathcal{CM}$-preserving, so that the $\mathcal{L}$1 scheme is at least $A(\pi/2)$ stable,
which is an improvement on stability analysis for $\mathcal{L}$1 scheme given in Jin, Lazarov and
Zhou (IMA J. Numer. Analy. 36:197-221, 2016). The good signs of the coefficients for such class of
schemes ensure the discrete fractional comparison principles, and allow us to establish the convergence
in a unified framework when applied to time fractional sub-diffusion equations and fractional
ODEs. The main tools in the analysis are a characterization of convolution inverses for completely
monotone sequences and a characterization of completely monotone sequences using Pick functions
due to Liu and Pego (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 368(12):8499-8518, 2016). The results for fractional
ODEs are extended to $\mathcal{CM}$-preserving numerical methods for Volterra integral equations
with general completely monotone kernels. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
main theoretical results.
