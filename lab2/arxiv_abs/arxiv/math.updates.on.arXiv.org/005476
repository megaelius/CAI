For an additive category $\mathbf{P}$ we provide an explict construction of a category $\mathcal{Q}(
\mathbf{P} )$ whose objects can be thought of as formally representing $\frac{\mathrm{im}( \gamma
)}{\mathrm{im}( \rho ) \cap \mathrm{im}( \gamma )}$ for given morphisms $\gamma: A \rightarrow
B$ and $\rho: C \rightarrow B$ in $\mathbf{P}$, even though $\mathbf{P}$ does not need to admit quotients
or images. We show how it is possible to calculate effectively within $\mathcal{Q}( \mathbf{P}
)$, provided that a basic problem related to syzygies can be handled algorithmically. We prove an
equivalence of $\mathcal{Q}( \mathbf{P} )$ with the subcategory of the category of contravariant
functors from $\mathbf{P}$ to the category of abelian groups $\mathbf{Ab}$ which contains all
finitely presented functors and is closed under the operation of taking images. Moreover, we characterize
the abelian case: $\mathcal{Q}( \mathbf{P} )$ is abelian if and only if it is equivalent to $\mathrm{fp}(
\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Ab} )$, the category of all finitely presented functors,
which in turn, by a theorem of Freyd, is abelian if and only if $\mathbf{P}$ has weak kernels. The category
$\mathcal{Q}( \mathbf{P} )$ is a categorical abstraction of the data structure for finitely presented
$R$-modules employed by the computer algebra system Macaulay2, where $R$ is a ring. By our generalization
to arbitrary additive categories, we show how this data structure can also be used for modeling finitely
presented graded modules, finitely presented functors, and some not necessarily finitely presented
modules over a non-coherent ring.
