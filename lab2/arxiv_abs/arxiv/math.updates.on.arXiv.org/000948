Around the 1960s a celebrated collection of papers emerged offering a number of explicit identities
for the class of isotropic stable processes in one and higher dimensions; these include, for example,
the lauded works of Blumenthal, Getoor, Ray, Port and Rogozin. Amongst other things, these results
nicely exemplify the use of standard Riesz potential theory on the unit open ball $\mathbb{B}_d
:=\{ x\in \mathbb{R}^d :|x|<1\}$, $\mathbb{R}^d\backslash\mathbb{B}_d$ and $\mathbb{S}_d
:=\partial \mathbb{B}_d$ with the, then, modern theory of potential analysis for Markov processes.
Following initial observations of Lamperti in 1972, with the occasional sporadic work of Kiu, Vuolle-Apiala
and Graversen in the 1980s, an alternative understanding of stable processes through the theory
of self-similar Markov processes has prevailed in the last decade or more. This point of view offers
deeper probabilistic insights into some of the aforementioned potential analytical relations.
In this review article, we will rediscover many of the aforementioned classical identities in relation
to the unit ball and recent extensions thereof by combining elements of these two theories, which
have otherwise been largely separated by decades in the literature. We present a dialogue that appeals
as much as possible to path decompositions. Most notable in this respect is the Lamperti-Kiu decomposition
of self-similar Markov processes and the Riesz-Bogdan-\.Zak transformation. Some of the proofs
we give are known, some are known proofs mixed with new methods and some proofs are completely new.
We assume that the reader has a degree of familiarity with the bare basics of L\'evy processes but
nonetheless, we often include reminders of standard material.
