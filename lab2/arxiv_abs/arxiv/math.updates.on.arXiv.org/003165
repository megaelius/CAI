Composite systems are large complex systems con- sisting of interconnected agents (subsystems).
Agents in a com- posite system interact with each other towards performing an in- tended goal. Controllability
is essential to achieve desired system performance in linear time-invariant composite systems.
Agents in a composite system are often uncontrollable individually, further, only a few agents
receive input. In such a case, the agents share/communicate their private state information with
pre-specified neighboring agents so as to achieve controllability. Our objective in this paper
is to identify an optimal network topology, optimal in the sense of minimum cardinality information
transfer between agents to guarantee the controllability of the composite system when the possible
neighbor set of each agent is pre-specified. We focus on graph-theoretic analysis referred to as
structural controllability as numerical entries of system matrices in complex systems are mostly
unknown. We first prove that given a set of agents and the possible set of neighbors, finding a minimum
cardinality set of information (interconnections) that must be shared to accomplish structural
controllability of the composite system is NP-hard. Subsequently, we present a polynomial-time
algorithm that finds a 2-optimal solution to this NP-hard problem. Our algorithm combines a minimum
weight bipartite matching algorithm and a minimum spanning tree algorithm and gives a subset of
interconnections which when established guarantees structural controllability, such that the
worst-case performance is 2-optimal. Finally, we show that our approach directly extends to weighted
constrained optimal net- work topology design problem and constrained optimal network topology
design problem in switched linear systems.
