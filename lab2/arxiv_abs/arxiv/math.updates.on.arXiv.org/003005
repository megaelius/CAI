Future vehicles are expected to be able to exploit increasingly the connected driving environment
for efficient, comfortable, and safe driving. Given relatively slow dynamics associated with
the state of charge and temperature response in electrified vehicles with large batteries, a long
prediction/planning horizon is needed to achieve improved energy efficiency benefits. In this
paper, we develop a two-layer Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for battery thermal and energy
management of electric vehicle (EV), aiming at improving fuel economy through real-time prediction
and optimization. In the first layer, the long-term traffic flow information and an approximate
model reflective of the relatively slow battery temperature dynamics are leveraged to minimize
energy consumption required for battery cooling while maintaining the battery temperature within
the desired operating range. In the second layer, the scheduled battery thermal and state of charge
(SOC) trajectories planned to achieve long-term battery energy-optimal thermal behavior are
used as the reference over a short horizon to regulate the battery temperature. Additionally, an
intelligent online constraint handling (IOCH) algorithm is developed to compensate for the mismatch
between the actual and predicted driving conditions and reduce the chance for battery temperature
constraint violation. The simulation results show that, depending on the driving cycle, the proposed
two-layer MPC is able to save 2.8-7.9% of the battery energy compared to the traditional rule-based
controller in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) operation scenario. Moreover, as compared
to a single layer MPC with a long horizon, the two-layer structure of the proposed MPC solution reduces
significantly the computing effort without compromising the performance.
