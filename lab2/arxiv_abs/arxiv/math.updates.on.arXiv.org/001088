Connected and autonomous vehicles will play a pivotal role in future Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITSs) and smart cities, in general. High-speed and low-latency wireless communication
links will allow municipalities to warn vehicles against safety hazards, as well as support cloud-driving
solutions to drastically reduce traffic jams and air pollution. To achieve these goals, vehicles
need to be equipped with a wide range of sensors generating and exchanging high rate data streams.
Recently, millimeter wave (mmWave) techniques have been introduced as a means of fulfilling such
high data rate requirements. In this paper, we model a highway communication network and characterize
its fundamental link budget metrics. In particular, we specifically consider a network where vehicles
are served by mmWave Base Stations (BSs) deployed alongside the road. To evaluate our highway network,
we develop a new theoretical model that accounts for a typical scenario where heavy vehicles (such
as buses and lorries) in slow lanes obstruct Line-of-Sight (LOS) paths of vehicles in fast lanes
and, hence, act as blockages. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive approximations for
the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) outage probability, as well as the probability
that a user achieves a target communication rate (rate coverage probability). Our analysis provides
new design insights for mmWave highway communication networks. In considered highway scenarios,
we show that reducing the horizontal beamwidth from $90^\circ$ to $30^\circ$ determines a minimal
reduction in the SINR outage probability (namely, $4 \cdot 10^{-2}$ at maximum). Also, unlike bi-dimensional
mmWave cellular networks, for small BS densities (namely, one BS every $500$ m) it is still possible
to achieve an SINR outage probability smaller than $0.2$.
