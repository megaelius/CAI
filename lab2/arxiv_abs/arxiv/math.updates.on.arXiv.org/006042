We show that when one draws a simple conformal loop ensemble (CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (8/3,4)$)
on an independent $\sqrt{\kappa}$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface and explores the CLE
in a natural Markovian way, the quantum surfaces (e.g., corresponding to the interior of the CLE
loops) that are cut out form a Poisson point process of quantum disks. This construction allows us
to make direct links between CLE on LQG, asymmetric $(4/\kappa)$-stable processes, and labeled
branching trees. The ratio between positive and negative jump intensities of these processes turns
out to be $-\cos (4 \pi / \kappa)$, which can be interpreted as a "density" of CLE loops in the CLE on
LQG setting. Positive jumps correspond to the discovery of a CLE loop (where the LQG length of the
loop is given by the jump size) and negative jumps correspond to the moments where the discovery process
splits the remaining to be discovered domain into two pieces. Some consequences are the following:
(i) It provides a construction of a CLE on LQG as a patchwork/welding of quantum disks. (ii) It allows
to construct the "natural quantum measure" that lives in a CLE carpet. (iii) It enables us to derive
some new properties and formulas for SLE processes and CLE themselves (without LQG) such as the exact
distribution of the trunk of the general asymmetric SLE$_\kappa(\kappa-6)$ processes. The present
work deals directly with structures in the continuum and makes no reference to discrete models,
but our calculations match those for scaling limits of O(N) models on planar maps with large faces
and CLE on LQG. Indeed, our L\'evy-tree descriptions are exactly the ones that appear in the study
of the large-scale limit of peeling of discrete decorated planar maps such as in recent work of Bertoin,
Budd, Curien and Kortchemski. The case of non-simple CLEs on LQG will be the topic of another paper.
