This paper deals with the Monte-Carlo methods for evaluating expectations of functionals of solutions
to McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDE) with drifts of super-linear growth.
We assume that the MV-SDE is approximated in the standard manner by means of an interacting particle
system and propose two importance sampling (IS) techniques to reduce the variance of the resulting
Monte Carlo estimator. In the \emph{complete measure change} approach, the IS measure change is
applied simultaneously in the coefficients and in the expectation to be evaluated. In the \emph{decoupling}
approach we first estimate the law of the solution in a first set of simulations without measure change
and then perform a second set of simulations under the importance sampling measure using the approximate
solution law computed in the first step. For both approaches, we use large deviations techniques
to identify an optimisation problem for the candidate measure change. The decoupling approach
yields a far simpler optimisation problem than the complete measure change, however, we can reduce
the complexity of the complete measure change through some symmetry arguments. We implement both
algorithms for two examples coming from the Kuramoto model from statistical physics and show that
the variance of the importance sampling schemes is up to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of
the standard Monte Carlo. The computational cost is approximately the same as for standard Monte
Carlo for the complete measure change and only increases by a factor of 2--3 for the decoupled approach.
We also estimate the propagation of chaos error and find that this is dominated by the statistical
error by one order of magnitude.
