Ideal gas dynamics can develop shock-like singularities with discontinuous density. Viscosity
typically regularizes such singularities and leads to a shock structure. On the other hand, in 1d,
singularities in the Hopf equation can be non-dissipatively smoothed via KdV dispersion. Here,
we develop a minimal conservative regularization of 3d ideal adiabatic flow of a gas with polytropic
exponent $\gamma$. It is achieved by augmenting the Hamiltonian by a capillarity energy $\beta(\rho)
(\nabla \rho)^2$. The simplest capillarity coefficient leading to local conservation laws for
mass, momentum, energy and entropy using the standard Poisson brackets is $\beta(\rho) = \beta_*/\rho$
for constant $\beta_*$. This leads to a Korteweg-like stress and nonlinear terms in the momentum
equation with third derivatives of $\rho$, which are related to the Bohm potential and Gross quantum
pressure. Just like KdV, our equations admit sound waves with a leading cubic dispersion relation,
solitary and periodic traveling waves. As with KdV, there are no steady continuous shock-like solutions
satisfying the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. Nevertheless, in 1d, for $\gamma = 2$, numerical
solutions show that the gradient catastrophe is averted through the formation of pairs of solitary
waves which can display approximate phase-shift scattering. Numerics also indicate recurrent
behavior in periodic domains. These observations are related to an equivalence between our regularized
equations (in the special case of constant specific entropy potential flow in any dimension) and
the defocussing nonlinear Schrodinger equation (cubically nonlinear for $\gamma = 2$), with $\beta_*$
playing the role of $\hbar^2$. Thus, our regularization of gas dynamics may be viewed as a generalization
of both the single field KdV & NLS equations to include the adiabatic dynamics of density, velocity,
pressure & entropy in any dimension.
