Let $S=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$ be a finite set of distinct positive integers. Throughout this
article we assume that the set $S$ is GCD closed. The LCM matrix $[S]$ of the set $S$ is defined to be
the $n\times n$ matrix with $\mathrm{lcm}(x_i,x_j)$ as its $ij$ element. The famous Bourque-Ligh
conjecture used to state that the LCM matrix of a GCD closed set $S$ is always invertible, but currently
it is a well-known fact that any nontrivial LCM matrix is indefinite and under the right circumstances
it can be even singular (even if the set $S$ is assumed to be GCD closed). However, not much more is known
about the inertia of LCM matrices in general. The ultimate goal of this article is to improve this
situation. Assuming that $S$ is a meet closed set we define an entirely new lattice-theoretic concept
by saying that an element $x_i\in S$ generates a double-chain set in $S$ if the set $\mathrm{meetcl}(C_S(x_i))\setminus
C_S(x_i)$ can be expressed as a union of two disjoint chains (here the set $C_S(x_i)$ consists of
all the elements of the set $S$ that are covered by $x_i$ and $\mathrm{meetcl}(C_S(x_i))$ is the
smallest meet closed subset of $S$ that contains the set $C_S(x_i)$). We then proceed by studying
the values of the M\"obius function on sets in which every element generates a double-chain set and
use the properties of the M\"obius function to explain why the Bourque-Ligh conjecture holds in
so many cases and fails in certain very specific instances. After that we turn our attention to the
inertia and see that in some cases it is possible to determine the inertia of an LCM matrix simply by
looking at the lattice-theoretic structure of $(S,|)$ alone. Finally, we are going to show how to
construct LCM matrices in which the majority of the eigenvalues is either negative or positive.
