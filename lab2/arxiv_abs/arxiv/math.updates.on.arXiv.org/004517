Lindel{\"o}f's hypothesis, one of the most important open problems in the history of mathematics,
states that for large $t$, Riemann's zeta function $\zeta(1/2+it)$ is of order $O(t^{\varepsilon})$
for any $\varepsilon>0$ . It is well known that for large $t$, the leading order asymptotics of the
Riemann zeta function can be expressed in terms of a transcendental exponential sum. The usual approach
to the Lindel\"of hypothesis involves the use of ingenious techniques for the estimation of this
sum. However, since such estimates can not yield an asymptotic formula for the above sum, it appears
that this strategy cannot lead to the proof of Lindel\"of's hypothesis. Here, a completely different
approach is introduced. In particular, a novel linear integral equation is derived for $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2,
\ 0<\sigma<1$ whose asymptotic analysis yields asymptotic results for a certain Riemann zeta-type
double exponential sum. This sum has the same structure as the sum describing the leading asymptotics
of $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2$, namely it involves $m_1^{-\sigma-it}m_2^{-\sigma-it}$, but its
summation limits are different than those of the sum corresponding to $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2$.
The analysis of the above integral equation requires the asymptotic estimation of four different
integrals denoted by $I_1,I_2,\tilde{I}_3,\tilde{I}_4$, as well as the derivation of an exact
relation between certain double exponential sums. Here, the latter relation is derived, and also
the rigorous analysis of the first two integrals $I_1$ and $I_2$ is presented. For the remaining
two integrals, formal results are only derived that suggest a possible roadmap for the derivation
of rigorous asymptotic results of the above double exponential sum, as well as for other sums associated
with $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|^2$. Additional developments suggested by the above novel approach
are also discussed.
