The vast infrastructure development, gas flow dynamics, and complex interdependence of gas with
electric power networks call for advanced computational tools. Solving the equations relating
gas injections to pressures and pipeline flows lies at the heart of natural gas network (NGN) operation,
yet existing solvers require careful initialization and uniqueness has been an open question.
In this context, this work considers the nonlinear steady-state version of the gas flow (GF) problem.
It first establishes that the solution to the GF problem is unique under arbitrary NGN topologies,
compressor types, and sets of specifications. For GF setups where pressure is specified on a single
(reference) node and compressors do no appear in cycles, the GF task is posed as an convex minimization.
To handle more general setups, a GF solver relying on a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained
quadratic program (MI-QCQP) is also devised. This solver can be used for any GF setup at any NGN. It
introduces binary variables to capture flow directions; relaxes the pressure drop equations to
quadratic inequality constraints; and uses a carefully selected objective to promote the exactness
of this relaxation. The relaxation is provably exact in NGNs with non-overlapping cycles and a single
fixed-pressure node. The solver handles efficiently the involved bilinear terms through McCormick
linearization. Numerical tests validate our claims, demonstrate that the MI-QCQP solver scales
well, and that the relaxation is exact even when the sufficient conditions are violated, such as
in NGNs with overlapping cycles and multiple fixed-pressure nodes.
