Schreier used the now-called Schreier sets to construct a counter-example to a question by Banach
and Sak. A set is weak-Schreier if $\min S \ge |S|$, strong-Schreier if $\min S>|S|$, and maximal
if $\min S = |S|$. For each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, define $M_n$ to be the number of weak-Schreier sets
with $n$ being its maximum. If we define the Fibonacci sequence to be $F_{-1} = 1$, $F_0 = 0$ and $F_m
= F_{m-1}+F_{m-2}$ for all $m\ge 1$, it is known that $M_n = F_{n}$ for all $n$. Zeckendorf proved
that every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of Fibonacci numbers such that no two
summands are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. We focus on the important requirement that no two consecutive
Fibonacci numbers are allowed to be in a sum and call this the Zeckendorf condition. For each $n\in
\mathbb{N}$, define $E_n$ to be the number of subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that satisfy the Zeckendorf
condition. It is well-known that $E_n = F_{n+2}$. First, we show four other ways to see the Fibonacci
sequence from counting Schreier sets. One of these ways gives the sequence $(C_n)_{n=1}^\infty$
such that $C_n = F_{n+2}$. Surprisingly, $C_n = E_n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. To connect these
two separate results, we provide a bijective mapping to show that $C_n = E_n$ directly. Next, a natural
question is about sequences formed by the number of sets that satisfy both the Schreier and the Zeckendorf
conditions. In particular, we say that a set satisfies the $k$-Zeckendorf condition if any two numbers
in the set are at least $k$ apart. We discover linear recurrence relations among the number of sets
satisfying both the Schreier and the $k$-Zeckendorf conditions. Lastly, we find the existence
of the Fibonacci sequence in the number of subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ whose two consecutive
numbers in increasing order differ by an odd number.
