Model predictive control problems for constrained hybrid systems are usually cast as mixed-integer
optimization problems (MIP). However, commercial MIP solvers are designed to run on desktop computing
platforms and are not suited for embedded applications which are typically restricted by limited
computational power and memory. To alleviate these restrictions, we develop a novel low-complexity,
iterative method for a class of non-convex, non-smooth optimization problems. This class of problems
encompasses hybrid model predictive control problems where the dynamics are piece-wise affine
(PWA). We give conditions such that the proposed algorithm has fixed points and show that, under
practical assumptions, our method is guaranteed to converge locally to local minima. This is in
contrast to other low-complexity methods in the literature, such as the non-convex alternating
directions method of multipliers (ADMM), for which no such guarantees are known for this class of
problems. By interpreting the PWA dynamics as a union of polyhedra we can exploit the problem structure
and develop an algorithm based on operator splitting procedures. Our algorithm departs from the
traditional MIP formulation, and leads to a simple, embeddable method that only requires matrix-vector
multiplications and small-scale projections onto polyhedra. We illustrate the efficacy of the
method on two numerical examples, achieving good closed-loop performance with computational
times several orders of magnitude smaller compared to state-of-the-art MIP solvers. Moreover,
it is competitive with ADMM in terms of suboptimality and computation time, but additionally provides
local optimality and local convergence guarantees.
