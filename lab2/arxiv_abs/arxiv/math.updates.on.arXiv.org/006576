A time-changed discretization for the Dirac equation is proposed. More precisely, we consider
a Dirac equation with discrete space and continuous time perturbed by a time-dependent diffusion
term $\sigma^2Ht^{2H-1}$ that seamlessly describes a latticizing version of the time-changed
Fokker-Planck equation carrying the Hurst parameter $0<H<1$. Our model problem formulated on
the space-time lattice $\mathbb{R}_{h,\alpha}^n\times [0,\infty)$ ($h>0$ and $0<\alpha<\frac{1}{2}$)
preserves the main features of the Dirac-K\"ahler type discretization over the space-time lattice
$h\mathbb{Z}^n\times [0,\infty)$ in case of $\alpha,H \rightarrow 0$, and encompasses a regularization
of Wilson's approach [Physical review D, 10(8), 2445, 1974] for values of $H$ in the range $0<H\leq
\frac{1}{2}$ (limit condition $\alpha \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$). The main focus here is the representation
of the solutions by means of discrete convolution formulae involving a kernel function encoded
by (unnormalized) Hartman-Watson distributions -- ubiquitous on stochastic processes of Bessel
type -- and the solutions of a semi-discrete equation of Klein-Gordon type. Namely, on our main construction
the ansatz function $\widehat{\varPsi}_H(y)$ appearing on the discrete convolution representation
may be rewritten as a Mellin convolution type integral involving the solutions $\varPsi(x,t|p)$
of a semi-discrete equation of Klein-Gordon type and a L\'evy one-sided distribution $L_H(u)$
in disguise. Interesting enough, by employing Mellin-Barnes integral representations it turns
out that the underlying solutions of Klein-Gordon type may be represented through generalized
Wright functions of type ${~}_1\Psi_1$, that converge uniformly in case that the quantity $\alpha+\frac{1}{2}$
may be regarded as an lower estimate for the Hurst parameter in the superdiffusive case (that is,
if $\alpha+\frac{1}{2}\leq H<1$).
