Consider a smooth variety $X$ and a smooth divisor $D\subset X$. Kim and Sato ( arXiv:0806.3819 )
define a natural compactification of $(X\setminus D)^n$, denoted $X_D^{[n]}$, which is a moduli
space of stable configurations of $n$ points lying on expansions of $(X,D)$ in the sense of Jun Li
( arXiv:math/0009097 , arXiv:math/0110113 ). The purpose of this note is to generalize Kim and Sato's
construction to the case where $X$ is an algebraic stack; and to construct an analogous projective
moduli space $W_\pi^{[n]}$ for a degeneration $\pi:W \to B$. We construct $X^n_D$ and $W_\pi^{[n]}$
and prove their properness using a universal construction introduced in our paper arXiv:1110.2976
with Cadman and Wise. We then use these spaces for a concrete application, as explained in the next
paragraph. In arXiv:1103.5132 , a degeneration formula for Gromov--Witten invariants of schemes
and stacks is developed, generalizing the approach of Jun Li. This in particular requires proving
properness of Li's stack of pre-deformable stable maps in the case where the target $(X,D)$ or $W\to
B$ is a Deligne--Mumford stack. One could simply adapt Li's proof, or follow the age-old tradition
of imposing such endeavor as an exercise on "the interested reader". Instead, we prefer to provide
a different proof here, which uses the properness of $X_D^{[n]}$ and $W_\pi^{[n]}$. Similar ideas
are used by Kim, Kresch and Oh ( arXiv:1105.6143 ) to prove the properness of their space of ramified
maps. This note is identical to the text available on our web pages since March 2013. It is posted now
as it has become an essential ingredient in others' work.
