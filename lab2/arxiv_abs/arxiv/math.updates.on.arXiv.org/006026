We formulate and prove a Rubin-type main conjecture for imaginary quadratic fields $K$ in which
a prime $p$ is inert or ramified, relating the characterstic ideal of a certain $\Lambda$-torsion
quotient of the Galois group of the maximal abelian pro-$p$-extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\oplus
2}$-extension of $K$ unramified outside $p$, to a supersingular Katz-type $p$-adic $L$-function.
A key component of this work is the development of a new interplay between Iwasawa theory and $p$-adic
Hodge theory, in order to extend the method of Coleman power series and construct measures from norm-compatible
systems of local units in the height 2 setting. We also formulate a Perrin-Riou-type Heegner point
main conjecture in the supersingular CM setting, and in certain cases relate it to the above Rubin-type
main conjecture. As an application, we prove rank 0 and 1 converse theorems for supersingular CM
elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$: "for $r = 0,1$, if $\mathrm{corank}_{\mathbb{Z}_p}\mathrm{Sel}_{p^{\infty}}(E/\mathbb{Q})
= r$ then $\mathrm{ord}_{s = 1}L(E/\mathbb{Q},s) = r$". We hence get results on two classical problems
of arithmetic. First, we prove the 1879 conjecture of Sylvester on primes expressible as the sum
of rational cubes: "If $p$ is a prime with $p \equiv 4,7, 8 \pmod{9}$, then there exist $x,y \in \mathbb{Q}$
such that $x^3 + y^3 = p$". Moreover, we show that the rank part of BSD holds for these elliptic curves.
Second, by combining our $p$-converse theorem with the Selmer distribution results of Smith, we
prove that 100\% of squarefree integers congruent to $5,6,7 \pmod{8}$ are congruent numbers, thus
settling the congruent number problem in 100\% of cases, and verifying the rank part of BSD and Goldfeld's
celebrated conjecture on quadratic twists for the congruent number family.
