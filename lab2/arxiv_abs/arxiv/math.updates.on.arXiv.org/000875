Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension n equipped with a very ample Hermitian line
bundle L. In the first part of the paper, we show that if there exists a toric degeneration of X satisfying
some natural hypotheses (which are satisfied in many settings), then there exists a completely
integrable system on X in the sense of symplectic geometry. More precisely, we construct a collection
of real-valued functions H_1, ... H_n on X which are continuous on all of X, smooth on an open dense
subset U of X, and pairwise Poisson-commute on U. Moreover, we show that in many cases, we can construct
the integrable system so that the functions H_1, ..., H_n generate a Hamiltonian torus action on
U. In the second part, we show that the toric degenerations arising in the theory of Newton-Okounkov
bodies satisfy all the hypotheses of the first part of the paper. In this case the image of the "moment
map" \mu = (H_1, ..., H_n): X to R^n is precisely the Okounkov body \Delta = \Delta(R, v) associated
to the homogeneous coordinate ring R of X, and an appropriate choice of a valuation v on R. Our main
technical tools come from algebraic geometry, differential (Kaehler) geometry, and analysis.
Specifically, we use the gradient-Hamiltonian vector field, and a subtle generalization of the
famous Lojasiewicz gradient inequality for real-valued analytic functions. Since our construction
is valid for a large class of projective varieties X, this manuscript provides a rich source of new
examples of integrable systems. We discuss concrete examples, including elliptic curves, flag
varieties of arbitrary connected complex reductive groups, spherical varieties, and weight varieties.
