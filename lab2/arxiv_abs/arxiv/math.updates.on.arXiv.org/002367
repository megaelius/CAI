In this manuscript we study the following optimization problem with volume constraint: $$\text{min}
\left\{\frac{1}{p}\int_{\Omega} |\nabla v|^pdx-\int_{\partial \Omega} gv\,dS \colon v \in
W^{1, p} (\Omega), \text{ and }|\{v>0\}| \leq \alpha\right\}.$$ Here $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$
is a bounded and smooth domain, $g$ is a continuous function and $\alpha$ is a fixed constant such
that $0< \alpha< |\Omega|$. Under the assumption that $ \int_{\partial \Omega} g(x)dS >0$ we prove
that a minimizer exists and satisfies $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{ccl} -\Delta_p u_p = 0 &\text{in
} &\{u_p>0\} \cup \{u_p<0\}, |\nabla u_p|^{p-2}\frac{\partial u_p}{\partial \nu} = g & \text{on
} &\partial \Omega \cap\partial(\{u_p>0\} \cup \{u_p<0\} ) , |\{u_p>0\}| = \alpha. & & \end{array}
\right. $$ Next, we analyze the limit as $p\to \infty$. We obtain that any sequence of weak solutions
converges, up to a subsequence, $\ \lim\limits_{p_j \to \infty} u_{p_j}(x)=u_{\infty}(x)$,
uniformly in $\overline{\Omega}$, and uniform limits, $u_\infty$, are solutions to the maximization
problem with volume constraint $$ \max\left\{ \int_{\partial \Omega} gv\,dS \colon v \in W^{1,
\infty}\left(\Omega\right), \|\nabla v\|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}\leq 1\text{ and }|\{v>0\}|
\leq \alpha\right\}. $$ Furthermore, we obtain the limit equation that is verified by $u_\infty$
in the viscosity sense. Finally, it turns out that such a limit variational problem is connected
to the Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem with the involved measures are supported on $\partial
\Omega$ and along the limiting free boundary, $\partial \{u_{\infty} \neq 0\}$. Furthermore,
we show some explicit examples of solutions for certain configurations of the domain and data.
