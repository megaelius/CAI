We create a simple test for distinguishing between sets of primes and random numbers using just the
sum-of-digits function. We find that the sum-of-the-digits of prime numbers does not have an equal
probability of being odd or even. The authors know of no reason why prime numbers should bias themselves
towards a particular parity in their sums of digits, but our empirical tests show a very strong bias;
strong enough that we are able to devise a test to reliably differentiate between collections of
prime numbers versus random numbers by looking only at their sums of digits. We are also able to create
similar tests for products of primes. We are even able to test "tainted" sets with mixtures of primes
and random numbers: as the percentage of (randomly chosen) prime numbers in a set of random numbers
is varied, we get a reliable, linear change in our parity measure. For example, when we add up the digits
of prime numbers in base 10, their sum is significantly more likely to be odd than even. This effect
persists across base changes, although which parity is more common might change. Note that the last
digit being odd in base 10 simply reverses the parity. We have tested this for the first fifty million
primes -- not primes up to 50,000,000, but the first 50,000,000 prime numbers -- and have found that
this effect persists, and does so in a predictable manner. The effect is quite significant; for 50,000,000
primes in base 10, the number of primes which have an odd sum-of-digits is about an order of magnitude
farther away from the mean than expected. We have run multiple tests to try and understand the source
of this bias, including investigating primes modulo random numbers and adjusting for Chebyshev's
bias. None of these tests yielded any satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon.
