We consider the forward problem of uncertainty quantification for the generalised Dirichlet eigenvalue
problem for a coercive second order partial differential operator with random coefficients, motivated
by problems in structural mechanics, photonic crystals and neutron diffusion. The PDE coefficients
are assumed to be uniformly bounded random fields, represented as infinite series parametrised
by uniformly distributed i.i.d. random variables. The expectation of the fundamental eigenvalue
of this problem is computed by (a) truncating the infinite series which define the coefficients;
(b) approximating the resulting truncated problem using lowest order conforming finite elements
and a sparse matrix eigenvalue solver; and (c) approximating the resulting finite (but high dimensional)
integral by a randomly shifted quasi-Monte Carlo lattice rule, with specially chosen generating
vector. We prove error estimates for the combined error, which depend on the truncation dimension
$s$, the finite element mesh diameter $h$, and the number of quasi-Monte Carlo samples $N$. Under
suitable regularity assumptions, our bounds are of the particular form $\mathcal{O}(h^2+N^{-1+\delta})$,
where $\delta>0$ is arbitrary and the hidden constant is independent of the truncation dimension,
which needs to grow as $h\to 0$ and $N\to\infty$. Although the eigenvalue problem is nonlinear,
which means it is generally considered harder than the analogous source problem, in almost all cases
we obtain error bounds that converge at the same rate as the corresponding rate for the source problem.
The proof involves a detailed study of the regularity of the fundamental eigenvalue as a function
of the random parameters. As a key intermediate result in the analysis, we prove that the spectral
gap (between the fundamental and the second eigenvalues) is uniformly positive over all realisations
of the random problem.
