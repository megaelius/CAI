We study a model of competition for resource through a chemostat-type model where species consume
the common resource that is constantly supplied. We assume that the species and resources are characterized
by a continuous trait. As already proved, this model, although more complicated than the usual Lotka-Volterra
direct competition model, describes competitive interactions leading to concentrated distributions
of species in continuous trait space. Here we assume a very fast dynamics for the supply of the resource
and a fast dynamics for death and uptake rates. In this regime we show that factors that are independent
of the resource competition become as important as the competition efficiency and that the direct
competition model is a good approximation of the chemostat. Assuming these two timescales allows
us to establish a mathematically rigorous proof showing that our resource-competition model with
continuous traits converges to a direct competition model. We also show that the two timescales
assumption is required to mathematically justify the corresponding classic result on a model consisting
of only finite number of species and resources (MacArthur, R. Theor. Popul. Biol. 1970:1, 1-11).
This is performed through asymptotic analysis, introducing different scales for the resource
renewal rate and the uptake rate. The mathematical difficulty relies in a possible initial layer
for the resource dynamics. The chemostat model comes with a global convex Lyapunov functional.
We show that the particular form of the competition kernel derived from the uptake kernel, satisfies
a positivity property which is known to be necessary for the direct competition model to enjoy the
related Lyapunov functional.
