Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) utilizes linear precoding to separate users in the spatial
domain and relies on fully treating any residual multi-user interference as noise. Non-Orthogonal
Multiple Access (NOMA) uses linearly precoded superposition coding with successive interference
cancellation (SIC) and relies on user grouping and ordering to enforce some users to fully decode
and cancel interference created by other users. In this paper, we argue that to efficiently cope
with the high throughput, heterogeneity of Quality-of-Service (QoS), and massive connectivity
requirements of future multi-antenna wireless networks, multiple access design needs to depart
from SDMA and NOMA. We develop a novel multiple access framework, called Rate-Splitting Multiple
Access (RSMA). RSMA is a more general and powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems
that contains SDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting with
SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the interference as noise.
This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise
enables to softly bridge the two extremes of fully decoding interference and treating interference
as noise, and provide room for rate and QoS enhancements, and complexity reduction. The three multiple
access schemes are compared and extensive numerical results show that RSMA provides a smooth transition
between SDMA and NOMA and outperforms them both in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and
overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths
and qualities of Channel State Information at the Transmitter). Moreover, RSMA provides rate and
QoS enhancements over NOMA at a lower computational complexity for the transmit scheduler and the
receivers (number of SIC layers).
