A graph is Hamiltonian if it contains a cycle passing through every vertex. One of the cornerstone
results in the theory of random graphs asserts that for edge probability $p \gg \frac{\log n}{n}$,
the random graph $G(n,p)$ is asymptotically almost surely Hamiltonian. We obtain the following
strengthening of this result. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, an {\em incompatibility system} $\mathcal{F}$
over $G$ is a family $\mathcal{F}=\{F_v\}_{v\in V}$ where for every $v\in V$, the set $F_v$ is a set
of unordered pairs $F_v \subseteq \{\{e,e'\}: e\ne e'\in E, e\cap e'=\{v\}\}$. An incompatibility
system is {\em $\Delta$-bounded} if for every vertex $v$ and an edge $e$ incident to $v$, there are
at most $\Delta$ pairs in $F_v$ containing $e$. We say that a cycle $C$ in $G$ is {\em compatible} with
$\mathcal{F}$ if every pair of incident edges $e,e'$ of $C$ satisfies $\{e,e'\} \notin F_v$. This
notion is partly motivated by a concept of transition systems defined by Kotzig in 1968, and can be
used as a quantitative measure of robustness of graph properties. We prove that there is a constant
$\mu>0$ such that the random graph $G=G(n,p)$ with $p(n) \gg \frac{\log n}{n}$ is asymptotically
almost surely such that for any $\mu np$-bounded incompatibility system $\mathcal{F}$ over $G$,
there is a Hamilton cycle in $G$ compatible with $\mathcal{F}$. We also prove that for larger edge
probabilities $p(n)\gg \frac{\log^8n}{n}$, the parameter $\mu$ can be taken to be any constant
smaller than $1-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}$. These results imply in particular that typically in $G(n,p)$
for $p \gg \frac{\log n}{n}$, for any edge-coloring in which each color appears at most $\mu np$ times
at each vertex, there exists a properly colored Hamilton cycle.
