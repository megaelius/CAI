In this paper, we motivate and define $\Phi$-energy density, $\Phi$-energy, $\Phi$-harmonic
maps and stable $\Phi$-harmonic maps. Whereas harmonic maps or $p$-harmonic maps can be viewed
as critical points of the integral of $\sigma_1$ of a pull-back tensor, $\Phi$-harmonic maps can
be viewed as critical points of the integral of $\sigma_2$ of a pull-back tensor. By an extrinsic
average variational method in the calculus of variations (cf. \cite{HW,WY,13,HaW}), we derive
the average second variation formulas for $\Phi$-energy functional, express them in orthogonal
notation in terms of the differential matrix, and find $\Phi$-superstrongly unstable $(\Phi$-$\text{SSU})$
manifolds. We prove, in particular that every compact $\Phi$-$\text{SSU}$ manifold must be $\Phi$-strongly
unstable $(\Phi$-$\text{SU})$, i.e., $(a)$ A compact $\Phi$-$\text{SSU}$ manifold cannot be
the target of any nonconstant stable $\Phi$-harmonic maps from any manifold, $\rm (b)$ The homotopic
class of any map from any manifold into a compact $\Phi$-$\text{SSU}$ manifold contains elements
of arbitrarily small $\Phi$-energy, $(\rm c)$ A compact $\Phi$-$\text{SSU}$ manifold cannot
be the domain of any nonconstant stable $\Phi$-harmonic map into any manifold, and $(\rm d)$ The
homotopic class of any map from a compact $\Phi$-$\text{SSU}$ manifold into any manifold contains
elements of arbitrarily small $\Phi$-energy (cf. Theorem $1.1 (a),(b),(c)$, and $(d)$.) We also
provide many examples of $\Phi$-SSU manifolds, and establish a link of $\Phi$-SSU manifold to $p$-SSU
manifold and topology. The extrinsic average variational method in the calculus of variations
that we have employed is in contrast to an average method in PDE that we applied in \cite {CW} to obtain
sharp growth estimates for warping functions in multiply warped product manifolds.
