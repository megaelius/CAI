GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis is a well-known decision support tool that can be used
in a wide variety of contexts. It is particularly useful for territorial planning in situations
where several actors with different, and sometimes contradictory, point of views have to take a
decision regarding land use development. While the impact of the weights used to represent the relative
importance of criteria has been widely studied in the recent literature, the impact of the order
weights used to combine the criteria have rarely been investigated. This paper presents a spatial
sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of order weights determination in GIS-based Multi-Criteria
Analysis by Ordered Weighted Averaging. We propose a methodology based on an efficient exploration
of the decision-strategy space defined by the level of risk and trade-off in the decision process.
We illustrate our approach with a land use planning process in the South of France. The objective
is to find suitable areas for urban development while preserving green areas and their associated
ecosystem services. The ecosystem service approach has indeed the potential to widen the scope
of traditional landscape-ecological planning by including ecosystem-based benefits, including
social and economic benefits, green infrastructures and biophysical parameters in urban and territorial
planning. We show that in this particular case the decision-strategy space can be divided into four
clusters. Each of them is associated with a map summarizing the average spatial suitability distribution
used to identify potential areas for urban development. We also demonstrate the pertinence of a
spatial variance within-cluster analysis to disentangle the relationship between risk and trade-off
values. At the end, we perform a site suitability ranking analysis to assess the relationship between
the four detected clusters.
