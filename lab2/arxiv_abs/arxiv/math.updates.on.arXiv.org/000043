We study continuous wavelet transforms associated to matrix dilation groups giving rise to an irreducible
square-integrable quasi-regular representation on ${\rm L}^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We first prove
that these representations are integrable as well, with respect to a wide variety of weights, thus
allowing to consistently quantify coefficient decay via coorbit space norms. We then show that
these spaces always admit an atomic decomposition in terms of bandlimited Schwartz wavelets. We
exhibit spaces of Schwartz functions densely contained in (most of) the coorbit spaces. We also
present an example showing that for a consistent definition of coorbit spaces, the irreducibility
requirement cannot be easily dispensed with. We then address the question how to predict wavelet
coefficient decay from vanishing moment assumptions. To this end, we introduce a new condition
on the open dual orbit associated to a dilation group: If the orbit is temperately embedded, it is
possible to derive rather general weighted ${\rm L}^{p,q}$-estimates for the wavelet coefficients
from vanishing moment conditions on the wavelet and the analyzed function. These estimates have
various applications: They provide very explicit admissibility conditions for wavelets and integrable
vectors, as well as sufficient criteria for membership in coorbit spaces. As a further consequence,
one obtains a transparent way of identifying elements of coorbit spaces with certain (cosets of)
tempered distributions. We then show that, for every dilation group in dimension two, the associated
dual orbit is temperately embedded. In particular, the general results derived in this paper apply
to the shearlet group and its associated family of coorbit spaces, where they complement and generalize
the known results.
