It is known that the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for the superquadratic viscous Hamilton-Jacobi
(VHJ) equation, which has important applications in stochastic control theory, admits a unique,
global viscosity solution. Solutions thus exist in the weak sense after the appearance of singularity
in finite time, which occurs through gradient blow-up (GBU) on the boundary. Whereas the theory
of viscosity solutions has been extensively studied and applied to many PDEs, there seem to be less
results on refined behavior of solutions. Although occurrence of two types of GBU with loss of boundary
condition (LBC) and without LBC are known, detailed behavior of viscosity solutions after GBU has
remained open except for a strongly restricted special class of solutions in one space dimension.
In this paper, in general dimensions, for each $ m \ge 1 $ we construct solutions which undergo GBU
and LBC at least at $ m $ times and then recover regularity. We also construct solutions that exhibit
GBU without LBC at their first blowup time. In one space dimension, we obtain the complete classification
of viscosity solutions at each time, which easily extends to radial cases in higher dimensions.
Furthermore for each $ m \ge 2 $ and an arbitrarily given combination of GBU types with/without LBC
at $ m $ times in an arbitrarily given order, we show the existence of a solution which exhibits this
exact combination of GBU. Some solutions display a new type of behavior called "bouncing". Singular
behaviors at multiple times are completely new in the context not only of VHJ equation but also of
stochastic control theory. In this framework our results imply that for certain spatial distributions
of rewards, if a controled Brownian particle starts near the boundary, then the net gain attains
profitable values on different time horizons but not on some intermediate times.
