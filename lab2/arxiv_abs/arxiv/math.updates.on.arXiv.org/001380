We introduce the notion of fully simple maps, which are maps in which the boundaries do not touch each
other, neither themselves. In contrast, maps where such a restriction is not imposed are called
ordinary. We study in detail the combinatorics of fully simple maps with topology of a disk or a cylinder.
We show that the generating series of simple disks is given by the functional inversion of the generating
series of ordinary disks. We also obtain an elegant formula for cylinders. These relations reproduce
the relation between cumulants and (higher order) free cumulants established by Collins et al math.OA/0606431,
and implement the symplectic transformation $x \leftrightarrow y$ on the spectral curve in the
context of topological recursion. We then prove that the generating series of fully simple maps
are computed by the topological recursion after exchange of $x$ and $y$, thus proposing a combinatorial
interpretation of the property of symplectic invariance of the topological recursion. Our proof
relies on a matrix model interpretation of fully simple maps, via the formal hermitian matrix model
with external field. We also deduce a universal relation between generating series of fully simple
maps and of ordinary maps, which involves double monotone Hurwitz numbers. In particular, (ordinary)
maps without internal faces - which are generated by the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble - and with boundary
perimeters $(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n)$ are strictly monotone double Hurwitz numbers with
ramifications $\lambda$ above $\infty$ and $(2,\ldots,2)$ above $0$. Combining with a recent
result of Dubrovin et al. math-ph/1612.02333, this implies an ELSV-like formula for these Hurwitz
numbers.
