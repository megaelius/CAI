Dimensional regularization of Euclidean momentum space integrals is a highly successful technique
in renormalization of quantum field theories. While it yields a straightforward algorithmic method,
with which to evaluate diagrams beyond tree level, the actual integrals can be highly divergent,
at least in a traditional sense. In particular, standard one-loop integrals can be expressed in
terms of an explicit formula, which associates both ultraviolet and infrared divergent parameter
values to analytically continued special function expressions. We aim to discuss the formulation
of finite integral expressions corresponding to the analytically continued structures. Effectively,
we wish to establish conditions which form an equivalence class for this analytical continuation,
or rather form a proper set/conditions of regularization techniques leading to it. This is further
demonstrated by considering both partially and fully successful strategies side-by-side, with
major emphasis on the two simplest functioning schemes: Gaussian and cut-off regularization.
By explicit computations we aim to associate these generalisations of the initial integrals with
the results from dimensional regularization, considering both multiple mass (or momentum) scales
as well as scaleless cases. We achieve the finiteness of the sought-after integrals by applying
one of these suitable schemes along with an additional scheme related scale. This enables us to devise
a proper representation of the dimensionally regularized expressions (or a local description)
through an operator removing all excess terms with the additional scale(s).
