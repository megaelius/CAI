In this paper, which is subsequent to our previous paper [PS] (but can be read independently from
it), we continue our study of the closed model structure on the category $\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{dgwu}}(\Bbbk)$
of small weakly unital dg categories (in the sense of Kontsevich-Soibelman [KS]) over a field $\Bbbk$.
In [PS], we constructed a closed model structure on the category of weakly unital dg categories,
imposing a technical condition on the weakly unital dg categories, saying that $\mathrm{id}_x\cdot
\mathrm{id}_x=\mathrm{id}_x$ for any object $x$. Although this condition led us to a great simplification,
it was redundant and had to be dropped. Here we get rid of this condition, and provide a closed model
structure in full generality. The new closed model category is as well cofibrantly generated, and
it is proven to be Quillen equivalent to the closed model category $\mathrm{Cat}_\mathrm{dg}(\Bbbk)$
of (strictly unital) dg categories over $\Bbbk$, given by Tabuada [Tab1]. Dropping the condition
$\mathrm{id}_x^2=\mathrm{id}_x$ makes the construction of the closed model structure more distant
from loc.cit., and requires new constructions. One of them is a pre-triangulated hull of a wu dg category,
which in turn is shown to be a wu dg category as well. One example of a weakly unital dg category which
naturally appears is the bar-cobar resolution of a dg category. We supply this paper with a refinement
of the classical bar-cobar resolution of a unital dg category which is strictly unital (appendix
B). A similar construction can be applied to constructing a cofibrant resolution in $\mathrm{Cat}_\mathrm{dgwu}(\Bbbk)$.
