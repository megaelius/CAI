Many problems in systems and control theory can be formulated in terms of robust D-stability analysis,
which aims at verifying if all the eigenvalues of an uncertain matrix lie in a given region D of the
complex plane. Robust D-stability analysis is an NP-hard problem and many polynomial-time algorithms
providing either sufficient or necessary conditions for an uncertain matrix to be robustly D-stable
have been developed in the past decades. Despite the vast literature on the subject, most of the contributions
consider specific families of uncertain matrices, mainly with interval or polytopic uncertainty.
In this work, we present a novel approach providing sufficient conditions to verify if a family of
matrices, whose entries depend polynomially on some uncertain parameters, is robustly D-stable.
The only assumption on the stability region D is that its complement is a semialgebraic set described
by polynomial constraints, which comprises the main important cases in stability analysis. Furthermore,
the D-stability analysis problem is formulated in a probabilistic framework. In this context,
the uncertain parameters characterizing the considered family of matrices are described by a set
of non a priori specified probability measures. Only the support and some of the moments (e.g., expected
values) are assumed to be known and, among all possible probability measures, we seek the one which
provides the minimum probability of D-stability. The robust and the probabilistic D-stability
analysis problems are formulated in a unified framework, and relaxations based on the theory of
moments are used to solve the D-stability analysis problem through convex optimization. Application
to robustness and probabilistic analysis of dynamical systems is discussed.
