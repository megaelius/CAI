We consider the problem of making a quick decision in favor of one of two possible physical models
while the numerical measurements are acquired by sensing devices featuring minimal digitization
complexity. Therefore, the digital data streams available for statistical processing are binary
and exhibit temporal and spatial dependencies. Such a setting is of relevance when designing radio
systems that have to perform time-critical monitoring tasks in noisy environments with low energy
consumption. We assess the latency penalty in sequential decision-making resulting from using
analog-to-binary instead of high-resolution analog-to-digital conversion at the front-ends.
To handle the intractable multivariate binary data model, we first consider sequential tests for
exponential family distributions. Within this generic probabilistic framework, we identify
approximations for the log-likelihood ratio and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The results
allow designing sequential detectors for binary radio systems and analyzing their average run-time
along classical arguments of Wald. In particular, the derived tests exploit the structure of the
spatio-temporal correlation of the analog sensor signals engraved into the binary radio data stream.
As an application, we consider the specification of binary sensing architectures in the context
of cognitive radio and satellite-based synchronization where our results characterize the detection
latency as a function of the temporal oversampling and the number of antennas. Finally, we evaluate
the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and illustrate the accuracy of our analysis via Monte-Carlo
simulations.
