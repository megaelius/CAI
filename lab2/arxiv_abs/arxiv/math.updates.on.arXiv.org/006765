The ubiquity of semilinear parabolic equations has been illustrated in their numerous applications
ranging from physics, biology, to materials and social sciences. In this paper, we consider a practically
desirable property for a class of semilinear parabolic equations of the abstract form $u_t=\mathcal{L}u+f[u]$
with $\mathcal{L}$ being a linear dissipative operator and $f$ being a nonlinear operator in space,
namely a time-invariant maximum bound principle, in the sense that the time-dependent solution
$u$ preserves for all time a uniform pointwise bound in absolute value imposed by its initial and
boundary conditions. We first study an analytical framework for some sufficient conditions on
$\mathcal{L}$ and $f$ that lead to such a maximum bound principle for the time-continuous dynamic
system of infinite or finite dimensions. Then, we utilize a suitable exponential time differencing
approach with a properly chosen generator of contraction semigroup to develop first- and second-order
accurate temporal discretization schemes, that satisfy the maximum bound principle unconditionally
in the time-discrete setting. Error estimates of the proposed schemes are derived along with their
energy stability. Extensions to vector- and matrix-valued systems are also discussed. We demonstrate
that the abstract framework and analysis techniques developed here offer an effective and unified
approach to study the maximum bound principle of the abstract evolution equation that cover a wide
variety of well-known models and their numerical discretization schemes. Some numerical experiments
are also carried out to verify the theoretical results.
