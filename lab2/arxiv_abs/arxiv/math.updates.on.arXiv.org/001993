In recent years it became apparent that geophysical abrasion can be well characterized by the time
evolution $N(t)$ of the number $N$ of static balance points of the abrading particle. Static balance
points correspond to the critical points of the particle's surface represented as a scalar distance
function $r$, measured from the center of mass, so their time evolution can be expressed as $N(r(t))$.
The mathematical model of the particle can be constructed on two scales: on the macro scale the particle
may be viewed as a smooth, convex manifold described by the smooth distance function $r$ with $N=N(r)$
equilibria, while on the micro scale the particle's natural model is a finely discretized, convex
polyhedral approximation $r^{\Delta}$ of $r$, with $N^{\Delta}=N(r^{\Delta})$ equilibria.
There is strong intuitive evidence suggesting that under some particular evolution models $N(t)$
and $N^{\Delta}(t)$ primarily evolve in the opposite manner. Here we create the mathematical framework
necessary to understand these phenomenon more broadly, regardless of the particular evolution
equation. We study micro and macro events in one-parameter families of curves and surfaces, corresponding
to bifurcations triggering the jumps in $N(t)$ and $N^{\Delta}(t)$. We show that the intuitive
picture developed for curvature-driven flows is not only correct, it has universal validity, as
long as the evolving surface $r$ is smooth. In this case, bifurcations associated with $r$ and $r^{\Delta}$
are coupled to some extent: resonance-like phenomena in $N^{\Delta}(t)$ can be used to forecast
downward jumps in $N(t)$ (but not upward jumps). Beyond proving rigorous results for the $\Delta
\to 0$ limit on the nontrivial interplay between singularities in the discrete and continuum approximations
we also show that our mathematical model is structurally stable, i.e. it may be verified by computer
simulations.
