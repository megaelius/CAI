We study the two-dimensional Anisotropic KPZ equation (AKPZ) formally given by \begin{equation*}
\partial_t H=\frac12\Delta H+\lambda((\partial_1 H)^2-(\partial_2 H)^2)+\xi\,, \end{equation*}
where $\xi$ is a space-time white noise and $\lambda$ is a strictly positive constant. While the
classical two-dimensional KPZ equation, whose nonlinearity is $|\nabla H|^2=(\partial_1 H)^2+(\partial_2
H)^2$, can be linearised via the Cole-Hopf transformation, this is not the case for AKPZ. We prove
that the stationary solution to AKPZ (whose invariant measure is the Gaussian Free Field) is superdiffusive:
its diffusion coefficient diverges for large times as $(\log t)^\delta$ for some $\delta\in (0,1)$,
in a Tauberian sense. Morally, this says that the correlation length grows with time like $t^{1/2}\times
(\log t)^{\delta/2}$. Moreover, we show that if the process is rescaled diffusively ($t\to t/\varepsilon^2,
x\to x/\varepsilon$), then it evolves non-trivially already on time-scales of order $1/|\log\varepsilon|^\delta$.
Both claims hold as soon as the coefficient $\lambda$ of the nonlinearity is non-zero, and the constant
$\delta$ is uniformly bounded away from zero for $\lambda$ small. Based on the mode-coupling approximation
(see e.g. [Spohn, H., J. Stat. Phys., '14]), we conjecture that the optimal value is $\delta=1/2$.
These results are in contrast with the belief, based on one-loop renormalization group calculations
(see [Wolf D., Phys. Rev. Lett., '91] and [Barab\`asi A.-L., Stanley H.-E., Cambridge University
Press, '95]) and numerical simulations [Halpin-Healy T.,Assdah A., Phys. Rev. A, '92], that the
AKPZ equation has the same large-scale behaviour as the two-dimensional Stochastic Heat Equation
(2dSHE) with additive noise (i.e. the case $\lambda=0$).
