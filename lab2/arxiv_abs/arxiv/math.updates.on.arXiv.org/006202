We are dealing with wave-current interaction (WCI) in a stochastic fluid flow. The objective is
to introduce stochasticity into WCI for the purpose of quantifying the uncertainty associated
with the wave physics in either the generalised Lagrangian mean (GLM) model. or the Craik--Leibovich
(CL) model. The key idea for the GLM approach is the separation of the Lagrangian (fluid) and Eulerian
(wave) degrees of freedom in Hamilton's principle. This is done by summing an Euler--Poincar\'e
{\it vector field Lagrangian} for the current flow and a {\it phase-space Lagrangian} for the wave
field. \smallskip To demonstrate the applicability of this hybrid approach, we use our wave-current
Hamilton's principle approach to close the deterministic Generalised Lagrangian Mean (GLM) equations
for a 3D Euler--Boussinesq (EB) fluid. We also apply the method to add wave physics and stochasticity
to the familiar 1D shallow water flow model.\smallskip In the appendices, we discuss finite dimensional
analogues and compare the differences in stochastic approaches for the GLM and CL models. The difference
in the types of stochasticity can be seen in the Kelvin circulation theorems for the two theories.
The GLM model acquires stochasticity in its transport velocity for the currents and its group velocity
for the waves. The CL model can accept stochasticity in its transport velocity for the currents,
too. However, CL model is based on modifying the Eulerian velocity in the integrand of the Kelvin
circulation. Thus, we introduce the probabilistic aspect of the wave dynamics via the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
(OU) process in the circulation integrand.
