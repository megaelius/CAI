This work is devoted to the causal perturbative Quantum Field Theory (QFT) due to Bogoliubov, including
QED and other realistic QFT. The white noise analysis and the Hida operators as the annihilation-creation
operators for free fields are used. The whole Bogoliubov method is unchanged. Causal axioms of such
QFT make sense on any globally causal space-times. It is proved that on the flat Minkowski spacetime
realstic QFT, including QED, lead to the scattering operator and interacting fields understood
as generalized operators in the white noise theory of Hida-Obata-Sait\^o with the perturbative
series equal to the Fock expansion of these operators in the sense of the white noise calculus and
make perfect sense in the adiabatic limit as the generalized operators. But in case of the flat Minkowski
space-time the realistic QFT, including QED, can be applied only to the scattering phenomena with
the many-particle plane wave generalized states as the \emph{in} and \emph{out} states. Theory
is mathematically consistent without any infrared or ultraviolet infinities. Feynman rules are
replaced with other much more effective recurrence rules for the higher order contributions to
the scattering operator. It is shown that realistic QFT, e.g. QED, are quite singular on the flat
Minkowski spacetime with the interacting fields as generalized operators, which are quite singular,
which after smearing with test function are not equal to ordinary operators. Bound state problems
cannot be treated entirely within QED on the Minkowski space-time. It is proved that on space-times
with compact Cauchy surfaces and non-zero curvature realistic causal perturbative QFT, including
QED, behave much better. Perturbative series for some of the realistic QFT are proved to be convergent
on the globally causal space-times with nonzero curvature and compact Cauchy surfaces.
