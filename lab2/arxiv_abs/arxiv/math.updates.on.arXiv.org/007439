We address the aircraft conflict resolution problem in air traffic control. We introduce new mixed-integer
programming formulations for aircraft conflict resolution with speed, heading and altitude control
which are based on disjunctive linear separation conditions. We first examine the two-dimensional
aircraft conflict resolution problem with speed and heading control represented as continuous
decision variables. We show that the proposed disjunctive linear separation conditions are equivalent
to the traditional nonlinear conditions for aircraft separation. Further, we characterize conflict-free
pairwise aircraft trajectories and propose a simple pre-processing algorithm to identify aircraft
pairs which are either always conflict-free, or which cannot be separated using speed and heading
control only. We then incorporate altitude control and propose a lexicographic optimization formulation
that aims to minimize the number of flight level changes before resolving outstanding conflicts
via two-dimensional velocity control. The proposed mixed-integer programming formulations
are nonconvex, and we propose convex relaxations, decomposition methods and constraint generation
algorithms to solve the two-dimensional and lexicographic optimization formulations to guaranteed
optimality. Numerical experiments on four types of conflict resolution benchmarking instances
are conducted to test the performance of the proposed mixed-integer formulations. Further, the
proposed disjunctive formulations are compared against state-of-the-art formulations based
on the so-called shadow separation condition. Our numerical results show that the proposed disjunctive
linear separation conditions outperform existing formulations in the literature and can solve
significantly more instances to global optimality. For reproducibility purposes, all formulations
and instances are made available on a public repository.
