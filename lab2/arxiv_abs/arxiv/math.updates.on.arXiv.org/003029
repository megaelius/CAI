We prove that, at least for the binary erasure channel (BEC), the polar-coding paradigm gives rise
to codes that not only approach the Shannon limit but do so under the best possible scaling of their
block length as a function of the gap to capacity. This result exhibits the first known family of binary
codes that attain both optimal scaling and quasi-linear complexity of construction, encoding
and decoding. Specifically, for any fixed $\delta > 0$, we exhibit binary linear codes that ensure
reliable communication at rates within $\varepsilon > 0$ of capacity with block length $n=O(1/\varepsilon^{2+\delta})$,
construction complexity $\Theta(n)$, and encoding/decoding complexity $\Theta(n\log n)$.
Our proof is based on the construction and analysis of binary polar codes with large kernels. It was
recently shown that, for all binary-input symmetric memoryless channels, conventional polar
codes (based on a $2\times 2$ kernel) allow reliable communication at rates within $\varepsilon
> 0$ of the Shannon capacity with block length, construction, encoding and decoding complexity
all bounded by a polynomial in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, this means that the block length
$n$ scales as $O(1/\varepsilon^{\mu})$, where the constant $\mu$ is called the scaling exponent.
It is furthermore known that the optimal scaling exponent is $\mu=2$, and it is achieved by random
linear codes. However, for general channels, the decoding complexity of random linear codes is
exponential in the block length. As far as conventional polar codes, their scaling exponent depends
on the channel, and for the binary erasure channel it is given by $\mu=3.63$. Our main contribution
is a rigorous proof of the following result: there exist $\ell\times\ell$ binary kernels, such
that polar codes constructed from these kernels achieve scaling exponent $\mu(\ell)$ that tends
to the optimal value of $2$ as $\ell$ grows.
