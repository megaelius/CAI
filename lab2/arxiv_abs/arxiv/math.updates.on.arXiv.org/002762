We study the following system of equations $$ L_i(u_i) = H_i(u_1,\cdots,u_m) \quad \text{in} \
\ \RR^n , $$ when $m\ge 1$, $u_i: \RR^n\to \RR$ and $H=(H_i)_{i=1}^m$ is a sequence of general nonlinearities.
The nonlocal operator $L_i$ is given by $$L_i(f (x)):= \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \int_{\RR^n\setminus
B_\epsilon(x) } [f(x) - f(z)] J_i(z-x) dz,$$ for a sequence of even, nonnegative and measurable
jump kernels $J_i$. We prove a Poincar\'{e} inequality for stable solutions of the above system
for a general jump kernel $J_i$. In particular, for the case of scalar equations, that is when $m=1$,
it reads \begin{equation*}\label{} \iint_{ \mathbb R^{2n}\cap \{|\nabla_x u|\neq 0\}} \mathcal
A_y(\nabla_x u) [\eta^2(x)+\eta^2(x+y)] J(y) dx dy \le \iint_{ \mathbb R^{2n}} \mathcal B_y(\nabla_x
u) [ \eta(x) - \eta(x+y) ] ^2 J(y) d x dy , \end{equation*} for any $\eta \in C_c^1(\mathbb R^{n})$
and for some nonnegative $ \mathcal A_y(\nabla_x u)$ and $ \mathcal B_y(\nabla_x u)$. This is a counterpart
of the celebrated inequality driven by Sternberg and Zumbrun in \cite{sz} for semilinear elliptic
equations that is used extensively in the literature to establish De Giorgi type results, to study
phase transitions and to prove regularity properties. We then apply this inequality to finite range
jump processes and to jump processes with decays to prove De Giorgi type results in two dimensions.
In addition, we show that whenever $H_i(u)\ge 0$ or $\sum_{i=1}^m u_i H_i(u)\le 0$ then Liouville
theorems hold for each $u_i$ in one and two dimensions. Lastly, we provide certain energy estimates
under various assumptions on the jump kernel $J_i$ and a Liouville theorem for the quotient of partial
derivatives of $u$.
