The Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was introduced by Evensen in 1994 [10] as a novel method for data
assimilation: state estimation for noisily observed time-dependent problems. Since that time
it has had enormous impact in many application domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation,
and numerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of an iterative
ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse problems. In this context we show
that the estimate of the unknown function that we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a
subspace A spanned by the initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the
error found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical experiments which
compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems with the error of the
best approximation in A, and with variants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted
to the subspace A. In so doing we demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems
provides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that achieved by traditional
least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order
of magnitude as that achieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate
these assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of piezometric head to determine
hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of groundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity
measurements at positive times to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.
