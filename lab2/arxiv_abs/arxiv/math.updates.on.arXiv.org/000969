WavePacket is an open-source program package for numeric simulations in quantum dynamics. It can
solve time-independent or time-dependent linear Schr\"odinger and Liouville-von Neumann-equations
in one or more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows, e.g., to simulate
molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Treating the interaction
with external electric fields within the semi-classical dipole approximation, WavePacket can
be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry.
Being highly versatile and offering visualization of quantum dynamics 'on the fly', WavePacket
is well suited for teaching or research projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics as well
as in physical or theoretical chemistry. Building on the previous Part I which dealt with closed
quantum systems and discrete variable representations, the present Part II focuses on the dynamics
of open quantum systems, with Lindblad operators modeling dissipation and dephasing. This part
also describes the WavePacket function for optimal control of quantum dynamics, building on rapid
monotonically convergent iteration methods. Furthermore, two different approaches to dimension
reduction implemented in WavePacket are documented here. In the first one, a balancing transformation
based on the concepts of controllability and observability Gramians is used to identify states
that are neither well controllable nor well observable. Those states are either truncated or averaged
out. In the other approach, the H2-error for a given reduced dimensionality is minimized by H2 optimal
model reduction techniques, utilizing a bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm.
