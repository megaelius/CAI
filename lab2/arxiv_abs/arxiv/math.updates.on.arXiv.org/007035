Originating from spectral graph theory, cospectrality is a powerful generalization of exchange
symmetry and can be applied to all real-valued symmetric matrices. Two vertices of an undirected
graph with real edge weights are cospectral iff the underlying weighted adjacency matrix $M$ fulfills
$[M^k]_{u,u} = [M^k]_{v,v}$ for all non-negative integer $k$, and as a result any eigenvector $\phi$
of $M$ has (or, in the presence of degeneracies, can be chosen to have) definite parity on $u$ and $v$.
We here show that the powers of a matrix with cospectral vertices induce further local relations
on its eigenvectors, and also can be used to design cospectrality preserving modifications. To
this end, we introduce the concept of \emph{walk equivalence} of cospectral vertices with respect
to \emph{walk multiplets} which are special vertex subsets of a graph. Walk multiplets allow for
systematic and flexible modifications of a graph with a given cospectral pair while preserving
this cospectrality. The set of modifications includes the addition and removal of both vertices
and edges, such that the underlying topology of the graph can be altered. In particular, we prove
that any new vertex connected to a walk multiplet by suitable connection weights becomes a so-called
unrestricted substitution point (USP), meaning that any arbitrary graph may be connected to it
without breaking cospectrality. Also, suitable interconnections between walk multiplets within
a graph are shown to preserve the associated cospectrality. Importantly, we demonstrate that the
walk equivalence of cospectral vertices $u,v$ imposes a local structure on every eigenvector $\phi$
obeying $\phi_{u} = \pm \phi_{v} \ne 0$ (in the case of degeneracies, a specific choice of the eigenvector
basis is needed). Our work paves the way for flexibly exploiting hidden structural symmetries in
the design of generic complex network-like systems.
