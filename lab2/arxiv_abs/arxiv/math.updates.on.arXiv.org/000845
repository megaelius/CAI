The performance of cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is constrained by the limited fronthaul link
capacity under future heavy data traffic. To tackle this problem, extensive efforts have been devoted
to design efficient signal quantization/compression techniques in the fronthaul to maximize
the network throughput. However, most of the previous results are based on information-theoretical
quantization methods, which are hard to implement due to the extremely high complexity. In this
paper, we consider using practical uniform scalar quantization in the uplink communication of
an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based C-RAN system, where the mobile
users are assigned with orthogonal sub-carriers for multiple access. In particular, we consider
joint wireless power control and fronthaul quantization design over the sub-carriers to maximize
the system end-to-end throughput. Efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the joint optimization
problem when either information-theoretical or practical fronthaul quantization method is applied.
Interestingly, we find that the fronthaul capacity constraints have significant impact to the
optimal wireless power control policy. As a result, the joint optimization shows significant performance
gain compared with either optimizing wireless power control or fronthaul quantization alone.
Besides, we also show that the proposed simple uniform quantization scheme performs very close
to the throughput performance upper bound, and in fact overlaps with the upper bound when the fronthaul
capacity is sufficiently large. Overall, our results would help reveal practically achievable
throughput performance of C-RAN, and lead to more efficient deployment of C-RAN in the next-generation
wireless communication systems.
