For the past couple of decades, numerical optimization has played a central role in addressing wireless
resource management problems such as power control and beamformer design. However, optimization
algorithms often entail considerable complexity, which creates a serious gap between theoretical
design/analysis and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose a new learning-based
approach. The key idea is to treat the input and output of a resource allocation algorithm as an unknown
non-linear mapping and use a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate it. If the non-linear mapping
can be learned accurately by a DNN of moderate size, then resource allocation can be done in almost
real time -- since passing the input through a DNN only requires a small number of simple operations.
In this work, we address both the thereotical and practical aspects of DNN-based algorithm approximation
with applications to wireless resource management. We first pin down a class of optimization algorithms
that are `learnable' in theory by a fully connected DNN. Then, we focus on DNN-based approximation
to a popular power allocation algorithm named WMMSE (Shi {\it et al} 2011). We show that using a DNN
to approximate WMMSE can be fairly accurate -- the approximation error $\epsilon$ depends mildly
[in the order of $\log(1/\epsilon)$] on the numbers of neurons and layers of the DNN. On the implementation
side, we use extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate that DNNs can achieve orders of magnitude
speedup in computational time compared to state-of-the-art power allocation algorithms based
on optimization.
