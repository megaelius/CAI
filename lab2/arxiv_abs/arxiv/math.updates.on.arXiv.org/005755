For gradient flows of energies, both spectral renormalization (SRN) and energy landscape (EL)
techniques have been used to establish slow motion of orbits near low-energy manifold. We show that
both methods are applicable to flows induced by families of gradients and compare the scope and specificity
of the results. The SRN techniques capture the flow in a thinner neighborhood of the manifold, affording
a leading order representation of the slow flow via as projection of the flow onto the tangent plane
of the manifold. The SRN approach requires a spectral gap in the linearization of the full gradient
flow about the points on the low-energy manifold. We provide conditions on the choice of gradient
under which the spectral gap is preserved, and show that up to reparameterization the slow flow is
invariant under these choices of gradients. The EL methods estimate the magnitude of the slow flow,
but cannot capture its leading order form. However the EL only requires normal coercivity for the
second variation of the energy, and does not require spectral conditions on the linearization of
the full flow. It thus applies to a much larger class of gradients of a given energy. We develop conditions
under which the assumptions of the SRN method imply the applicability of the EL method, and identify
a large family of gradients for which the EL methods apply. In particular we apply both approaches
to derive the interaction of multi-pulse solutions within the 1+1D Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard
(FCH) gradient flow, deriving gradient invariance for a class of gradients arising from powers
of a homogeneous differential operator.
