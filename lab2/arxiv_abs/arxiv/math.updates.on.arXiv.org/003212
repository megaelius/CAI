This paper meticulously revisit and study the flux geometry of any compact connected oriented manifold
$(M, W)$. We generalize several well-known factorization results, and exhibit some orbital conditions
under which the flux geometry can be studied: This enables us to recover several well-known results
from symplectic geometry using different methods. The fix points theory does not resist to the above
machinery: We prove a general contractibility result with respect to the orbits of the fix-points
for volume preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map, generalize and solve the Arnold
conjecture using the Thurston fragmentation property together with some consequences of the above
factorizations. In the sequel, we use fix points to: Characterize the flux geometry of certain $C^0$limits
of sequences of vanishing flux paths and volume preserving diffeomorphisms. Beside this, a $C^0$criterion
for the existence of at least one fix-point is given, and several weak versions of the generalized
$C^0$flux conjecture are solved. Finally, we construct a pseudo right invariant metric on the group
of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity map, prove several comparison
results suitable to the study of the Hofer-like geometry of the group $Ham(N;w)$, of all Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(N,w)$, derive the equivalence between the Hofer
and the Hofer-like metrics on $Ham(N,w)$, and exhibit an analytic proof of the nondegeneracy of
the Hofer like energies: The outcome is that the Calabi group controls the Hofer like geometry of
the group $Ham(N,w)$. This includes several other interesting results.
