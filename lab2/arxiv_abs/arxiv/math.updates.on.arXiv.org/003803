The resource framework of quantum coherence was introduced by Baumgratz, Cramer and Plenio [PRL
113, 140401 (2014)] and further developed by Winter and Yang [PRL 116, 120404 (2016)]. We consider
the one-shot problem of distilling pure coherence from a single instance of a given resource state.
Specifically, we determine the distillable coherence with a given fidelity under incoherent operations
(IO) through a generalisation of the Winter-Yang protocol. This is compared to the distillable
coherence under maximal incoherent operations (MIO) and dephasing-covariant incoherent operations
(DIO), which can be cast as a semidefinite programme, that has been presented previously by Regula
et al. [PRL 121, 010401 (2018)]. Our results are given in terms of a smoothed min-relative entropy
distance from the incoherent set of states, and a variant of the hypothesis-testing relative entropy
distance, respectively. The one-shot distillable coherence is also related to one-shot randomness
extraction. Moreover, from the one-shot formulas under IO, MIO, DIO, we can recover the optimal
distillable rate in the many-copy asymptotics, yielding the relative entropy of coherence. These
results can be compared with previous work by some of the present authors [Zhao et al., PRL 120, 070403
(2018)] on one-shot coherence formation under IO, MIO, DIO and also SIO. This shows that the amount
of distillable coherence is essentially the same for IO, DIO, and MIO, despite the fact that the three
classes of operations are very different. We also relate the distillable coherence under strictly
incoherent operations (SIO) to a constrained hypothesis testing problem and explicitly show the
existence of bound coherence under SIO in the asymptotic regime.
