It is our aim to establish a general analytic theory of asymptotic expansions of type f(x)=a_1 phi_1(x)+dots+
a_n phi_n(x)+o(phi_n(x)), x tends to x_0 (*), where the given ordered n-tuple of real-valued functions
phi_1 dots,phi_n forms an asymptotic scale at x_0. By analytic theory, as opposed to the set of algebraic
rules for manipulating finite asymptotic expansions, we mean sufficient and/or necessary conditions
of general practical usefulness in order that (*) hold true. Our theory is concerned with functions
which are differentiable (n-1) or n times and the presented conditions involve integro-differential
operators acting on f, phi_1, dots, phi_n. We essentially use two approaches; one of them is based
on canonical factorizations of nth-order disconjugate differential operators and gives conditions
expressed as convergence of certain improper integrals, very useful for applications. The other
approach, valid for (n-1)-time differentiable functions starts from simple geometric considerations
(as old as Newton's concept of limit tangent) and gives conditions expressed as the existence of
finite limits, as x tends to x_0, of certain Wronskian determinants constructed with f, phi_1, dots,
phi_n. There is a link between the two approaches and it turns out that the integral conditions found
via the factorizational approach have striking geometric meanings. Our theory extends to general
expansions the theory of polynomial asymptotic expansions thoroughly investigated in a previous
paper. In the first part of our work we study the case of two comparison functions phi_1, phi_2. The
theoretical background for the two-term theory is much simpler than that for n >=3 and, in addition,
it is unavoidable to separate the treatments as the two-term formulas must be explicitly written
lest they become unreadable.
