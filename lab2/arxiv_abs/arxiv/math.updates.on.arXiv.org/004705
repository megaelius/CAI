We are concerned with rigid analytic geometry in the general setting of Henselian fields $K$ with
separated analytic structure, whose theory was developed by Cluckers--Lipshitz--Robinson.
It unifies earlier work and approaches of numerous mathematicians. Separated analytic structures
admit reasonable relative quantifier elimination in a suitable analytic language. However, the
rings of global analytic functions with two kinds of variables seem not to have good algebraic properties
such as Noetherianity or excellence. Therefore the usual global resolution of singularities from
rigid analytic geometry is no longer at our disposal. Our main purpose is to give a definable version
of the canonical desingularization algorithm (the hypersurface case) due to Bierstone--Milman
so that both these powerful tools are available in the realm of non-Archimedean analytic geometry
at the same time. It will be carried out within a category of definable, strong analytic manifolds
and maps, which is more flexible than that of affinoid varieties and maps. Strong analytic objects
are those definable ones that remain analytic over all fields elementarily equivalent to $K$. This
condition may be regarded as a kind of symmetry imposed on ordinary analytic objects. The strong
analytic category makes it possible to apply a model-theoretic compactness argument in the absence
of the ordinary topological compactness. On the other hand, our closedness theorem enables application
of resolution of singularities to topological problems involving the topology induced by valuation.
Eventually, these three results will be applied to such issues as the existence of definable retractions
or extending continuous definable functions.
