Functional and effective networks inferred from time series are at the core of network neuroscience.
Since it is common practice to compare network properties between patients and controls, it is crucial
for inferred network models to reflect key underlying structural properties. However, even a few
spurious links severely distort the shortest-path length and derived measures including the small-world
coefficient, providing misleading insights into the macroscopic topology of the network. This
poses a challenge for functional connectomes based on correlation, whose transitivity necessarily
induce numerous false positives. We study how false positives bias the properties of the networks
inferred by bivariate and multivariate algorithms. Mutual information, bivariate transfer entropy,
and multivariate transfer entropy are respectively used for inferring functional, directed-functional,
and effective networks. The validation is performed on synthetic ground truth networks with 100--200
nodes and various topologies (regular lattice, small-world, random, scale-free, modular), as
well as on a real macaque connectome. The time series of node activity are simulated via autoregressive
dynamics. We find that multivariate transfer entropy captures key properties of all network structures
for longer time series. Bivariate methods can achieve higher recall (sensitivity) for shorter
time series; however, as available data increases, they are unable to control false positives (lower
specificity). This leads to overestimated clustering, small-world, and rich-club coefficients,
underestimated shortest path lengths and hub centrality, and fattened degree distribution tails.
Caution should therefore be used when interpreting network properties of functional connectomes
obtained via correlation or pairwise statistical dependence measures, rather than more holistic
(yet data-hungry) multivariate models.
