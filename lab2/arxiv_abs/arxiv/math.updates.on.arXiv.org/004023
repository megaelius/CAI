We consider a randomised implementation of the finite element method (FEM) for elliptic partial
differential equations on high-dimensional models. This is motivated by applications where model
predictions are essential for real-time process diagnostics. In these circumstances it is imperative
to expedite prediction without a significant compromise in the model's fidelity, which in turn
relies on the rapid assembly and solution of the associated system of equations typically at the
many-query context. Our approach involves converting the solution of the linear, symmetric positive
definite FEM system into an over-determined least squares problem, whose solution is then projected
onto a low-dimensional subspace. The resulting low-dimensional system can be effectively sketched
as a product of two high-dimensional matrices using a parameter-dependent non-uniform sampling
distribution, utilising only a small subset of the model's parameters. Although different to the
optimal sampling distributions based on the statistical leverage-scores of the rows of the matrices,
we show that the distance between them shrinks for an appropriate choice of the projection subspace.
For the approximate solution we bound the incurring errors due to the projection, subspace approximation
and sketching and show that the overall error is dominated by the condition number of the projected
stiffness matrix. Our approach is tested on simulations on the Dirichlet and Neumann problems for
the steady-state diffusion equation. The results show that our approach has on average a tenfold
improvement on the computational times compared to the classical deterministic framework at the
expense of a moderately small approximation error.
