Cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as autonomous vehicles rely on both on-board sensors and external
communications to estimate their state. Unfortunately, these communications render the system
vulnerable to cyber-attacks. While many attack detection methods have begun to address these concerns,
they are limited to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI system models provide accurate
approximations for CPS such as autonomous vehicles at constant speed and turning radii, they are
inaccurate for more complex motions such as lane changes, turns, and changes in velocity. Since
these more complex motions are more suitably described by linear time-varying (LTV) system models
rather than LTI models, Dynamic Watermarking, which adds a private excitation to the input signal
to validate measurements, has recently been extended to LTV systems. However, this extension does
not allow for LTV systems that require several steps before the effect of a given control input can
be seen in the measurement signal. Additionally, there is no consideration for the time-varying
effects of auto-correlation. Furthermore, a proof of concept was only provided using simulations
of a simplified model. This paper relaxes the requirement for inputs to be visible in a single step
and constructs an auto-correlation normalizing factor to remove the effects of auto-correlation.
In addition, Dynamic Watermarking is applied to a high-fidelity vehicle model in carsim and a 1/10
scale autonomous rover to further reinforce the proof of concept for realistic systems. In each
case, the vehicle follows a predefined path with time-varying velocity and turning radii. A replay
attack, which replays previously recorded measurements, is shown to be detectable using LTV Dynamic
Watermarking in a quick and repeatable manner.
