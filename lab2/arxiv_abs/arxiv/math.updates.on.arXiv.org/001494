Fix an integer partition lambda that has no more than n parts. Let beta be a weakly increasing n-tuple
with entries from {1,..,n}. The flagged Schur function indexed by lambda and beta is a polynomial
generating function in x_1, .., x_n for certain semistandard tableaux of shape lambda. Let pi be
an n-permutation. The type A Demazure character (key polynomial, Demazure polynomial) indexed
by lambda and pi is another such polynomial generating function. Reiner and Shimozono and then Postnikov
and Stanley studied coincidences between these two families of polynomials. Here their results
are sharpened by the specification of unique representatives for the equivalence classes of indexes
for both families of polynomials, extended by the consideration of more general beta, and deepened
by proving that the polynomial coincidences also hold at the level of the underlying tableau sets.
Let R be the set of lengths of columns in the shape of lambda that are less than n. Ordered set partitions
of {1,..,n} with block sizes determined by R, called R-permutations, are used to describe the minimal
length representatives for the parabolic quotient of the nth symmetric group specified by the set
{1,..,n-1}\R. The notion of 312-avoidance is generalized from n-permutations to these set partitions.
The R-parabolic Catalan number is defined to be the number of these. Every flagged Schur function
arises as a Demazure polynomial. Those Demazure polynomials are precisely indexed by the R-312-avoiding
R-permutations. Hence the number of flagged Schur functions that are distinct as polynomials is
shown to be the R-parabolic Catalan number. The projecting and lifting processes that relate the
notions of 312-avoidance and of R-312-avoidance are described with maps developed for other purposes.
