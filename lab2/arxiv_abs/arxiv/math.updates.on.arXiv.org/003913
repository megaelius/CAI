This paper contributes to the study of large data problems for $C^1$ solutions of the relativistic
Euler equations. In the $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetime setting, if the initial data are away from
vacuum, a key difficulty in proving the global well-posedness or finite time blow-up is coming up
with a way to obtain sharp enough control on the lower bound of the mass-energy density function $\rho$.
First, for $C^1$ solutions of the 1-dimensional classical isentropic compressible Euler equations
in the Eulerian setting, we show a novel idea of obtaining a mass density time-dependent lower bound
by studying the difference of the two Riemann invariants, along with certain weighted gradients
of them. Furthermore, using an elaborate argument on a certain ODE inequality and introducing some
key artificial (new) quantities, we apply this idea to obtain the lower bound estimate for the mass-energy
density of the (1+1)-dimensional relativistic Euler equations. Ultimately, for $C^1$ solutions
with uniformly positive initial mass-energy density of the (1+1)-dimensional relativistic Euler
equations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the formation of singularity in finite
time, which gives a complete picture for the ($C^1$) large data problem in dimension $(1+1)$. Moreover,
for the (3+1)-dimensional relativistic fluids, under the assumption that the initial mass-energy
density vanishes in some open domain, we give two sufficient conditions for $C^1$ solutions to blow
up in finite time, no matter how small the initial data are. We also do some interesting studies on
the asymptotic behavior of the relativistic velocity when vacuum appears at the far field, which
tells us that one can not obtain any global regular solution whose $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ decays to
zero as time $t$ goes to infinity.
