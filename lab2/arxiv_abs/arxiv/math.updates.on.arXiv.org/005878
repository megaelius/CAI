In this paper we consider authentication at the physical layer, in which the authenticator aims
at distinguishing a legitimate supplicant from an attacker on the basis of the characteristics
of the communication channel. Authentication is performed over a set of parallel wireless channels
affected by time-varying fading at the presence of a malicious attacker, whose channel has a spatial
correlation with the supplicant's one. We first propose the use of two different statistical decision
methods, and we prove that using a large number of references (in the form of channel estimates) affected
by different levels of time-varying fading is not beneficial from a security point of view. We then
propose to exploit classification methods based on machine learning. In order to face the worst
case of an authenticator provided with no forged messages during training, we consider one-class
classifiers. When instead the training set includes some forged messages, we resort to more conventional
binary classifiers, considering the cases in which such messages are either labelled or not. For
the latter case, we exploit clustering algorithms to label the training set. The performance of
both nearest neighbor (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) classification techniques is assessed.
Through numerical examples, we show that under the same probability of false alarm, one-class classification
(OCC) algorithms achieve the lowest probability of missed detection when a small spatial correlation
exists between the main channel and the adversary one, while statistical methods are advantageous
when the spatial correlation between the two channels is large.
