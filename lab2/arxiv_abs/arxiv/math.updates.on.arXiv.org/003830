This study presents a numerical analysis of the topology of a set of cosmologically interesting
three-dimensional Gaussian random fields in terms of their Betti numbers $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$
and $\beta_2$. We show that Betti numbers entail a considerably richer characterization of the
topology of the primordial density field. Of particular interest is that Betti numbers specify
which topological features - islands, cavities or tunnels - define its spatial structure. A principal
characteristic of Gaussian fields is that the three Betti numbers dominate the topology at different
density ranges. At extreme density levels, the topology is dominated by a single class of features.
At low levels this is a \emph{Swiss-cheeselike} topology, dominated by isolated cavities, at high
levels a predominantly \emph{Meatball-like} topology of isolated objects. At moderate density
levels, two Betti number define a more \emph{Sponge-like} topology. At mean density, the topology
even needs three Betti numbers, quantifying a field consisting of several disconnected complexes,
not of one connected and percolating overdensity. A {\it second} important aspect of Betti number
statistics is that they are sensitive to the power spectrum. It reveals a monotonic trend in which
at a moderate density range a lower spectral index corresponds to a considerably higher (relative)
population of cavities and islands. We also assess the level of complementary information that
Betti numbers represent, in addition to conventional measures such as Minkowski functionals.
To this end, we include an extensive description of the Gaussian Kinematic Formula (GKF), which
represents a major theoretical underpinning for this discussion.
