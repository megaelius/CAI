We express the Masur-Veech volume and the area Siegel-Veech constant of the moduli space of meromorphic
quadratic differential with simple poles as polynomials in the intersection numbers of psi-classes
supported on the boundary cycles of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of
curves. Our formulae are derived from lattice point count involving the Kontsevich volume polynomials
that also appear in Mirzakhani's recursion for the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of
bordered hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. A similar formula for the Masur-Veech volume (though without
explicit evaluation) was obtained earlier by Mirzakhani through completely different approach.
We prove further result: up to an explicit normalization factor depending only on the genus and on
the number of cusps, the density of the orbit of any simple closed multicurve computed by Mirzakhani
coincides with the density of square-tiled surfaces having horizontal cylinder decomposition
associated to the simple closed multicurve. We study the resulting densities in more detail in the
special case when there are no cusps. In particular, we compute explicitly the asymptotic frequencies
of separating and non-separating simple closed geodesics on a closed hyperbolic surface of genus
g for all small genera g and we show that in large genera the separating closed geodesics are exponentially
less frequent. We conclude with detailed conjectural description of combinatorial geometry of
a random simple closed multicurve on a surface of large genus and of a random square-tiled surface
of large genus. This description is conditional to the conjectural asymptotic formula for the Masur-Veech
volume in large genera and to the conjectural uniform asymptotic formula for certain sums of intersection
numbers of psi-classes in large genera.
