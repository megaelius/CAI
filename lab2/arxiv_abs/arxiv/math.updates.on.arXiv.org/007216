Is it always true that every polynomial P with the degree at least two has a fixed point z0, the real
part of whose multiplier is bigger than or equal to 1, i.e., Real part of (P'(z0))> 1? This question,
raised by Coelho and Kalantari in How many real attractive fixed points can a polynomial have? Math.
Gaz. 103 (2019), no. 556, 65{76. [3] is answered affirmatively not only for all polynomials but also
for all rational functions with a super attracting fixed point. However, this is not true for all
rational functions. Some further investigation on distribution of multipliers of fixed points
is made. Quadratic and cubic polynomials, all of whose multipliers have real part 1 are characterized.
A necessary and sufficient condition is found for cubic and quartic polynomials, all of whose multipliers
are equidistant from Is it always true that every polynomial P with the degree at least two has a fixed
