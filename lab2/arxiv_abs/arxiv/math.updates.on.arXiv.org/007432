This paper establishes the global uniform-in-time boundedness of solutions to the following Keller-Setel
system with signal-dependent diffusion and chemotaxis \begin{equation}\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
u_t=\nabla\cdot(\gamma(v)\nabla u - u\phi(v)\nabla v),\quad & x\in \Omega, t>0,\\ v_t = d\Delta
v- v+u,\quad & x\in \Omega, t>0 \end{array}\right.\end{equation} in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N(N\leq4)$
with smooth boundary, where the density-dependent motility functions $\gamma(v)$ and $\phi(v)$
denote the diffusive and chemotactic coefficients, respectively. The model was originally proposed
by Keller and Segel in \cite{Keller-1} to describe the aggregation phase of Dictyostelium discoideum
cells, where the two motility functions satisfy a proportional relation $\chi(v)=(\alpha -1)\gamma'(v)$
with $\alpha>0$ denoting the ratio of effective body length (i.e. distance between receptors)
to the step size. The major technical difficulty in the analysis is the possible degeneracy of diffusion.
In this work, we show that if $\gamma(v)>0$ and $\phi(v)>0$ are smooth on $[0,\infty)$ and satisfy
$$\inf_{v\geq0} \frac{d\gamma(v)}{v\phi(v)(v\phi(v)+d-\gamma(v))_+}>\frac{N}{2},$$
then the above Keller-Segel system subject to Neumann boundary conditions admits classical solutions
uniformly bounded in time. The main idea of proving our results is the estimates of a weighted functional
$\int_\Omega u^{p}v^{-q}dx$ for $p>\frac{N}{2}$ by choosing a suitable exponent $p$ depending
on the unknown $v$, by which we are able to derive a uniform $L^\infty$-norm of $v$ and hence rule out
the diffusion degeneracy.
