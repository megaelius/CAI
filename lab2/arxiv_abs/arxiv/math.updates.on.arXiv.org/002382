In his classical work, Kuramoto analytically described the onset of synchronization in all-to-all
coupled networks of phase oscillators with random intrinsic frequencies. Specifically, he identified
a critical value of the coupling strength, at which the incoherent state loses stability and a gradual
build-up of coherence begins. Recently, Kuramoto's scenario was shown to hold for a large class
of coupled systems on convergent families of deterministic and random graphs. Guided by these results,
in the present work, we study several model problems illustrating the link between network topology
and synchronization in coupled dynamical systems. First, we identify several families of graphs,
for which the transition to synchronization in the Kuramoto model starts at the same critical value
of the coupling strength and proceeds in practically the same way. These examples include Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, Paley graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and certain stochastic block graphs.
These examples illustrate that some rather simple structural properties such as the volume of the
graph may determine the onset of synchronization, while finer structural features may affect only
higher order statistics of the transition to synchronization. Further, we study the transition
to synchronization in the Kuramoto model on power law and small-world random graphs. The former
family of graphs endows the Kuramoto model with very good synchronizability: the synchronization
threshold can be made arbitrarily low by varying the parameter of the power law degree distribution.
For the Kuramoto model on small-world graphs, in addition to the transition to synchronization,
we identify a new bifurcation leading to stable random twisted states. The examples analyzed in
this work complement the results in [Chiba, Medvedev, The mean field analysis for the Kuramoto model
on graphs (parts I and II), arxiv].
