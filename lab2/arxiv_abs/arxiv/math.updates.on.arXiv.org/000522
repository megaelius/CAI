This work has its origins in an attempt to describe systematically the integrable geometries and
gauge theories in dimensions one to four related to twistor theory. In each such dimension, there
is a nondegenerate integrable geometric structure, governed by a nonlinear integrable differential
equation, and each solution of this equation determines a background geometry on which, for any
Lie group $G$, an integrable gauge theory is defined. In four dimensions, the geometry is selfdual
conformal geometry and the gauge theory is selfdual Yang-Mills theory, while the lower-dimensional
structures are nondegenerate (i.e., non-null) reductions of this. Any solution of the gauge theory
on a $k$-dimensional geometry, such that the gauge group $H$ acts transitively on an $\ell$-manifold,
determines a $(k+\ell)$-dimensional geometry ($k+\ell\leqslant4$) fibering over the $k$-dimensional
geometry with $H$ as a structure group. In the case of an $\ell$-dimensional group $H$ acting on itself
by the regular representation, all $(k+\ell)$-dimensional geometries with symmetry group $H$
are locally obtained in this way. This framework unifies and extends known results about dimensional
reductions of selfdual conformal geometry and the selfdual Yang-Mills equation, and provides
a rich supply of constructive methods. In one dimension, generalized Nahm equations provide a uniform
description of four pole isomonodromic deformation problems, and may be related to the ${\rm SU}(\infty)$
Toda and dKP equations via a hodograph transformation. In two dimensions, the ${\rm Diff}(S^1)$
Hitchin equation is shown to be equivalent to the hyperCR Einstein-Weyl equation, while the ${\rm
SDiff}(\Sigma^2)$ Hitchin equation leads to a Euclidean analogue of Plebanski's heavenly equations.
