Localized spot patterns, where one or more solution components concentrates at certain points
in the domain, are a common class of localized pattern for reaction-diffusion systems, and they
arise in a wide range of modeling scenarios. In an arbitrary bounded 3-D domain, the existence, linear
stability, and slow dynamics of localized multi-spot patterns is analyzed for the well-known singularly
perturbed Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) activator-inhibitor system in the limit of a small activator
diffusivity $\varepsilon^2\ll 1$. Our main focus is to classify the different types of multi-spot
patterns, and predict their linear stability properties, for different asymptotic ranges of the
inhibitor diffusivity $D$. For the range $D={\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{-1})\gg 1$, although
both symmetric and asymmetric quasi-equilibrium spot patterns can be constructed, the asymmetric
patterns are shown to be always unstable. On this range of $D$, it is shown that symmetric spot patterns
can undergo either competition instabilities or a Hopf bifurcation, leading to spot annihilation
or temporal spot amplitude oscillations, respectively. For $D={\mathcal O}(1)$, only symmetric
spot quasi-equilibria exist and they are linearly stable on ${\mathcal O}(1)$ time intervals.
On this range, it is shown that the spot locations evolve slowly on an ${\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$
time scale towards their equilibrium locations according to an ODE gradient flow, which is determined
by a discrete energy involving the reduced-wave Green's function. The central role of the far-field
behavior of a certain core problem, which characterizes the profile of a localized spot, for the
construction of quasi-equilibria in the $D={\mathcal O}(1)$ and $D={\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$
regimes, and in establishing some of their linear stability properties, is emphasized.
