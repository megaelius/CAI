Let $M$ be a subharmonic function on a domain $D$ in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ with the Riesz measure
$\nu_M$. Let $f$ be a non-zero holomorphic function on $D$ such that $\log |f|\leq M$ on $D$ and the
function $f$ vanish on a sequence ${\tt Z}=\{{\tt z}_k\}_{k=1,2, \dots}\subset D$ {\large(}$u\not\equiv
-\infty$ be a subharmonic function on $D$ with the Riesz measure or the mass distribution $\nu_u$,
and $u\leq M$ on $D$ resp.{\large)}. Then restrictions on the growth of the Riesz measure $\nu_M$
of the function $M$ near the boundary of the domain $D$ entail certain restrictions on the distribution
of points of the sequence $\tt Z$ (to the mass distribution $\nu_u$ resp.). A quantitative form of
research of this phenomenon is given immediately in the subharmonic framework. We also establish
results in the inverse direction. We investigated in detail the cases when $D$ is $\mathbb C$, the
unit disk, exterior of the unit disk, a concentric annulus, and $M$ is a radial function; $D$ is a regular
domain and $M$ are constant on the level lines of Green's function of this domain $D$; $D$ is a domain
of hyperbolic type, and $M$ are the superpositions of convex functions with functions that depend
on the hyperbolic radius; $D$ is a regular domain and $M$ is the superposition of convex functions
with a function dependent on the distance to some subset of the boundary of the domain $D$. All our
main results and their implementation in more or less concrete situations are new not only for subharmonic
functions $u$, and also for holomorphic functions $f$ even in the case when $D$ is $\mathbb C$, the
unit disk, an annulus etc.
