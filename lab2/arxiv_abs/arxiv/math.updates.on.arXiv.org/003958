Ecological resilience refers to the ability of a system to retain its state when subject to state
variables perturbations or parameter changes. While understanding and quantifying resilience
is crucial to anticipate the possible regime shifts, characterizing the influence of the system
parameters on resilience is the first step towards controlling the system to avoid undesirable
critical transitions. In this paper, we apply tools of qualitative theory of differential equations
to study the resilience of competing populations as modeled by the classical Lotka-Volterra system.
Within the high interspecific competition regime, such model exhibits bistability, and the boundary
between the basins of attraction corresponding to exclusive survival of each population is the
stable manifold of a saddle-point. Studying such manifold and its behavior in terms of the model
parameters, we characterized the populations resilience: while increasing competitiveness
leads to higher resilience, it is not always the case with respect to reproduction. Within a pioneering
context where both populations initiate with few individuals, increasing reproduction leads
to an increase in resilience; however, within an environment previously dominated by one population
and then invaded by the other, an increase in resilience is obtained by decreasing the reproduction
rate. Besides providing interesting insights for the dynamics of competing population, this work
brings near to each other the theoretical concepts of ecological resilience and the mathematical
methods of differential equations and stimulates the development and application of new mathematical
tools for ecological resilience.
