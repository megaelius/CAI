We introduce a setting where a receiver aims to perfectly recover a source known privately to a \textit{strategic}
sender over a possibly noisy channel. The sender is endowed with a utility function and sends signals
to the receiver with the aim of maximizing this utility. Due to the strategic nature of the sender
not all the transmitted information is truthful, which leads to question: how much true information
can be recovered by the receiver from such a sender? We study this question in this paper. We pose the
problem as a game between the sender and receiver, where the receiver tries to maximize the number
of sequences that can be recovered perfectly and the sender maximizes its utility. We show that,
in spite of the sender being strategic and the presence of noise in the channel, there is a strategy
for the receiver by which it can perfectly recover an \textit{exponentially} large number of sequences.
Our analysis leads to the notion of the \textit{information extraction capacity} of the sender
which quantifies the growth rate of the number of recovered sequences with blocklength, in the presence
of a noiseless channel. We identify cases where this capacity is equal to its theoretical maximum,
and also when it is strictly less than maximum. In the latter case, we show that the capacity is sandwiched
between the independence number and the Shannon capacity of a suitably defined graph. These results
lead to an exact characterization of the information extraction capacity in large number of cases.
We show that in the presence of a noisy channel, the rate of information extraction achieved by the
receiver is the minimum of the zero-error capacity of the channel and the information extraction
capacity of the sender. Our analysis leads to insights into a novel regime of communication involving
strategic agents.
