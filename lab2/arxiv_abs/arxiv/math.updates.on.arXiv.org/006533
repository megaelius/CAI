We study identity testing for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and more generally for undirected
graphical models. Given sample access to the Gibbs distribution corresponding to an unknown or
hidden model $M^*$ and given an explicit model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they
are (statistically) far apart? Daskalakis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial-time algorithm
for identity testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model. In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic
(repulsive) Ising model, Bez\'akov\'a et al. (2019) proved that unless $RP=NP$ there is no identity
testing algorithm when $\beta d=\omega(\log{n})$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the visible
graph and $\beta$ is the largest edge weight in absolute value. We prove analogous hardness results
for RBMs (i.e., mixed Ising models on bipartite graphs), even when there are no latent variables
or an external field. Specifically, we show that if $RP \neq NP$, then when $\beta d=\omega(\log{n})$
there is no polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for RBMs; when $\beta d =O(\log{n})$
there is an efficient identity testing algorithm that utilizes the structure learning algorithm
of Klivans and Meka (2017). In addition, we prove similar lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic
RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and for the ferromagnetic Potts model. Previous hardness
results for identity testing of Bez\'akov\'a et al. (2019) utilized the hardness of finding the
maximum cuts, which corresponds to the ground states of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. Since
RBMs are on bipartite graphs such an approach is not feasible. We instead introduce a general methodology
to reduce from the corresponding approximate counting problem and utilize the phase transition
that is exhibited by RBMs and the mean-field Potts model.
