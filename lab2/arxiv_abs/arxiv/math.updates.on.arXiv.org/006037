We abstract the core logical functions from applications that require ultra-low-latency wireless
communications to provide a novel definition for reliability. Real-time applications -- such
as intelligent transportation, remote surgery, and industrial automation -- involve a significant
element of control and decision making. Such systems involve three logical components: observers
(e.g. sensors) measuring the state of an environment or dynamical system, a centralized executive
(e.g. controller) deciding on the state, and agents (e.g. actuators) that implement the executive's
decisions. The executive harvests the observers' measurements and decides on the short-term trajectory
of the system by instructing its agents to take appropriate actions. All observation packets (typically
uplink) and action packets (typically downlink) must be delivered by hard deadlines to ensure the
proper functioning of the controlled system. In-full on-time delivery cannot be guaranteed in
wireless systems due to inherent uncertainties in the channel such as fading and unpredictable
interference; accordingly, the executive will have to drop some packets. We develop a novel framework
to formulate the observer selection problem (OSP) through which the executive schedules a sequence
of observations that maximize its knowledge about the current state of the system. To solve this
problem efficiently yet optimally, we devise a branch-and-bound algorithm that systematically
prunes the search space. Our work is different from existing work on real-time communications in
that communication reliability is not conveyed by packet loss or error rate, but rather by the extent
of the executive's knowledge about the state of the system it controls.
