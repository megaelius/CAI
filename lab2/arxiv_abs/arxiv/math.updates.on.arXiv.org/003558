We first make a root space analysis on the Lie algebra of normal form vector fields with two pairs of
non-resonant imaginary modes. In this direction, the family of normal form vector fields in formal
power series is extended to the family in Laurent series. We consider the factor Lie algebra of Laurent
family over its radical ideal and study its maximal toral and Cartan subalgebras. The factor algebra
is described by its root space decomposition within a projective linear system. We show that there
exists an infinite \(\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{Z}\)-sequence of distinct pairs of transversal
|(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\)-Lie subalgebras in the factor algebra. Each pair is a linear root space isomorphic
to \(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{sl}(2)\). We propose a normal form decomposition of non-resonant
double Hopf singularities into a sum of Eulerian, rotational and conservative vector fields. The
rotational family stems from the radical ideal and the Eulerian structure is characterized by a
projective limit construction in terms of an infinite sequence of real affine Kac-Moody Lie subalgebras.
The conservative family constitutes a transversal complementary Poisson algebra for the first
two transversal Lie subalgebras. We introduce a semidirect product Lie algebra for a complete Lie
algebra characterization of normal form vector fields in both Laurent and formal power series.
We provide the infinite level normal form and orbital normal form classifications for families
with rotational and Eulerian parts. We consider multiple-parametric input systems and provide
their infinite level controlled normal form classification. Finally, we apply the normal form
control approach on a two-joint robotic arm. The infinite level normal form of the controlled robotic
arm are presented. Our suggested nonlinear feedback controller design stabilizes a two-joint
robotic arm acrobat around its vertical equilibrium.
