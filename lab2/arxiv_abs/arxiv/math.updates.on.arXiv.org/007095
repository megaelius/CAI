This paper studies continuous-time optimal contracting in a hierarchy problem which generalises
the model of Sung (2015). The hierarchy is modeled by a series of interlinked principal-agent problems,
leading to a sequence of Stackelberg equilibria. More precisely, the principal can contract with
the managers to incentivise them to act in her best interest, despite only observing the net benefits
of the total hierarchy. Managers in turn subcontract with the agents below them. Both agents and
managers independently control in continuous time a stochastic process representing their outcome.
First, we show through a continuous-time adaptation of Sung's model that, even if the agents only
control the drift of their outcome, their manager controls the volatility of their continuation
utility. This first simple example justifies the use of recent results on optimal contracting for
drift and volatility control, and therefore the theory of second-order backward stochastic differential
equations, developed in the theoretical part of this paper, dedicated to a more general model. The
comprehensive approach we outline highlights the benefits of considering a continuous-time model
and opens the way to obtain comparative statics. We also explain how the model can be extended to a
large-scale principal-agent hierarchy. Since the principal's problem can be reduced to only an
$m$-dimensional state space and a $2m$-dimensional control set, where $m$ is the number of managers
immediately below her, and is therefore independent of the size of the hierarchy below these managers,
the dimension of the problem does not explode.
