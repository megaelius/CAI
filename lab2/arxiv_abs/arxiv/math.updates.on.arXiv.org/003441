Stagewise training strategy is commonly used for learning neural networks, which uses a stochastic
algorithm (e.g., SGD) starting with a relatively large step size (aka learning rate) and geometrically
decreasing the step size after a number of iterations. It has been observed that the stagewise SGD
has much faster convergence than the vanilla SGD with a continuously decreasing step size in terms
of both training error and testing error. {\it But how to explain this phenomenon has been largely
ignored by existing studies.} This paper provides theoretical evidence for explaining this faster
convergence. In particular, we consider the stagewise training strategy for minimizing empirical
risk that satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, which has been observed/proved for
neural networks and also holds for a broad family of convex functions. For convex loss functions
and "nice-behaviored" non-convex loss functions that are close to a convex function (namely weakly
convex functions), we establish that the faster convergence of stagewise training than the vanilla
SGD under the same condition on both training error and testing error lies on better dependence on
the condition number of the problem. Indeed, the proposed algorithm has additional favorable features
that come with theoretical guarantee for the considered non-convex optimization problems, including
using explicit algorithmic regularization at each stage, using stagewise averaged solution for
restarting, and returning the last stagewise averaged solution as the final solution. To differentiate
from commonly used stagewise SGD, we refer to our algorithm as stagewise regularized training algorithm
or {\start}. Of independent interest, the proved testing error bound of {\start} for a family of
non-convex loss functions is dimensionality and norm independent.
