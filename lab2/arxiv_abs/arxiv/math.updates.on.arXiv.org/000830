Let $\mathbf{g}$ be a pseudo--Riemanian metric of arbitrary signature on a manifold $\mathbf{V}$
with conventional $n+n$ dimensional splitting, $\ n\geq 2,$ determined by a nonholonomic (non--integrable)
distribution $\mathcal{N}$ defining a generalized (nonlinear) connection and associated nonholonomic
frame structures. We shall work with a correspondingly adapted linear metric compatible connection
$\hat{\mathbf{D}}$ and its nonzero torsion $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$, both completely determined
by $\mathbf{g}$. Our first goal is to prove that there are certain generalized frame and/or jet transforms
and prolongations with $(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{V})\rightarrow (\hat{\mathbf{g}},\hat{\mathbf{V}})$
into explicit classes of solutions of some generalized Einstein equations $\hat{\mathbf{R}}\mathit{ic}=\Lambda
\hat{\mathbf{g}}$, $\Lambda =const$, encoding various types of nonholonomic) Ricci soliton
configurations and/or jet variables and symmetries. The second goal is to solve additional constraint
equations for zero torsion, $\hat{\mathcal{T}}=0$, on generalized solutions constructed in
explicit forms with jet variables and extract Levi-Civita configurations. This allows us to find
generic off-diagonal exact solutions depending on all space time coordinates on $\mathbf{V}$
via generating and integration functions and various classes of constant jet parameters and associated
symmetries. We shall study (third goal) how such generalized metrics and connections can be related
by so-called "half-conformal" and/ or jet deformations of certain sub-classes of solutions with
one, or two, Killing symmetries. Finally, there are considered some examples when exact solutions
are constructed as nonholonomic jet prolongations of the Kerr metrics, with possible Ricci soliton
deformations, and characterized by nonholonomic jet structures and generalized connections.
