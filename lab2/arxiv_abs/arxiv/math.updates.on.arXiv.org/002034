Superintegrable systems are a class of physical systems which possess more conserved quantities
than their degrees of freedom. The study of these systems has a long history and continues to attract
significant international attention. This thesis investigates finite dimensional quantum superintegrable
systems with scalar potentials as well as vector potentials with monopole type interactions. We
introduce new families of $N$-dimensional superintegrable Kepler-Coulomb systems with non-central
terms and double singular harmonic oscillators in the Euclidean space, and new families of superintegrable
Kepler, MIC-harmonic oscillator and deformed Kepler systems interacting with Yang-Coulomb monopoles
in the flat and curved Taub-NUT spaces. We show their multiseparability and obtain their Schr\"{o}dinger
wave functions in different coordinate systems. We show that the wave functions are given by (exceptional)
orthogonal polynomials and Painlev\'{e} transcendents (of hypergeometric type). We construct
higher-order algebraically independent integrals of motion of the systems via the direct and constructive
approaches. These integrals form (higher-rank) polynomial algebras with structure constants
involving Casimir operators of certain Lie algebras. We obtain finite dimensional unitary representations
of the polynomial algebras and present the algebraic derivations for degenerate energy spectra
of these systems. Finally, we present a generalized superintegrable Kepler-Coulomb model from
exceptional orthogonal polynomials and obtain its energy spectrum using both the separation of
variable and the algebraic methods.
