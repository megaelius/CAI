We consider ballistic annihilation, a model for chemical reactions introduced in the 1980's physics
literature. In this particle system, initial locations are given by a renewal process on the line,
motions are ballistic (i.e. particles are assigned constant velocities, chosen i.i.d.) and collisions
between pairs of particles result in mutual annihilation. We focus on the case when velocities are
symmetrically distributed among three values, i.e. particles either remain static (with probability
$p$) or move at constant velocity uniformly chosen among $\pm1$. We show that this model goes through
a phase transition at $p_c=1/4$ between a subcritical regime where each particle eventually annihilates
and a supercritical regime where a positive density of static particles is never hit, confirming
1990's predictions of Droz et al.[8] for the particular case of a Poisson process. Our result covers
cases where triple collisions can happen; these are resolved by annihilation of one static and one
randomly chosen moving particle. Our arguments, of combinatorial nature, show that, although
the model is not completely solvable, certain large scale features can be explicitly computed,
and are universal, i.e. insensitive to the distribution of the initial point process. In particular,
in the critical and subcritical regimes, the asymptotics of the time decay of the densities of each
type of particle is universal (among exponentially integrable interdistance distributions)
and, in the supercritical regime, the distribution of the "skyline" process, i.e. the process restricted
to the last particles to ever visit a location, has a universal description. We also prove that the
alternative model from [6], where triple collisions resolve by mutual annihilation of the three
particles involved, does not share the same universality as our model, and find numerical bounds
on its critical probability.
