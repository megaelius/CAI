The transfer operator (TO) formalism of the dynamical systems (DS) theory is reformulated here
in terms of the recently proposed cohomological theory (ChT) of stochastic differential equations
(SDE). It turns out that the stochastically generalized TO (GTO) of the DS theory is the finite-time
ChT Fokker-Planck evolution operator. As a result comes the supersymmetric trivialization of
the so-called sharp trace and sharp determinant of the GTO, with the former being the Witten index
of the ChT. Moreover, the Witten index is also the stochastic generalization of the Lefschetz index
so that it equals the Euler characteristic of the (closed) phase space for any flow vector field,
noise metric, and temperature. The enabled possibility to apply the spectral theorems of the DS
theory to the ChT Fokker-Planck operators allows to extend the previous picture of the spontaneous
topological supersymmetry (Q-symmetry) breaking onto the situations with negative ground state's
attenuation rate. The later signifies the exponential growth of the number of periodic solutions/orbits
in the large time limit, which is the unique feature of chaotic behavior proving that the spontaneous
breakdown of Q-symmetry is indeed the field-theoretic definition and stochastic generalization
of the concept of deterministic chaos. In addition, the previously proposed low-temperature classification
of SDE's, i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium / noise-induced chaos ((anti-)instanton condensation)
/ ordinary chaos (non-integrability), is complemented by the discussion of the high-temperature
regime where the sharp boundary between the noise-induced and ordinary chaotic phases must smear
out into a crossover, and at even higher temperatures the Q-symmetry is restored. An unambiguous
resolution of the Ito-Stratonovich dilemma in favor of the Stratonovich approach and/or Weyl quantization
is also presented.
