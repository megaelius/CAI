Physical phenomena in science and engineering are frequently modeled using scalar fields. In scalar
field topology, graph-based topological descriptors such as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb
graphs are commonly used to characterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields.
One of the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based visualization is to
understand and incorporate uncertainty into such topological descriptors to effectively reason
about their underlying data. In this paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge
trees and use it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree that minimizes
its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a well-defined metric called the interleaving
distance. We provide heuristic strategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose
labels do not fully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that resembles
a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and outputs a tree as their structural
average. We also highlight structural similarities between the input and the average and incorporate
uncertainty information for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty, referred
to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees. Finally, we demonstrate an application
of our framework through merge trees that arise from ensembles of scalar fields. Our work is the first
to employ interleaving distances and consistency to study a global, mathematically rigorous,
structural average of merge trees in the context of uncertainty visualization.
