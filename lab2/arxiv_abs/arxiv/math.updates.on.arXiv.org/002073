The `full' edge isoperimetric inequality for the discrete cube (due to Harper, Bernstein, Lindsay
and Hart) specifies the minimum size of the edge boundary $\partial A$ of a set $A \subset \{0,1\}^n$,
as a function of $|A|$. A weaker (but more widely-used) lower bound is $|\partial A| \geq |A| \log_2(2^n/|A|)$,
where equality holds iff $A$ is a subcube. In 2011, the first author obtained a sharp `stability'
version of the latter result, proving that if $|\partial A| \leq |A| (\log(2^n/|A|)+\epsilon)$,
then there exists a subcube $C$ such that $|A \Delta C|/|A| = O(\epsilon /\log(1/\epsilon))$. The
`weak' version of the edge isoperimetric inequality has the following well-known generalization
for the `$p$-biased' measure $\mu_p$ on the discrete cube: if $p \leq 1/2$, or if $0 < p < 1$ and $A$ is
monotone increasing, then $p\mu_p(\partial A) \geq \mu_p(A) \log_p(\mu_p(A))$. In this paper,
we prove a sharp stability version of the latter result, which generalizes the aforementioned result
of the first author. Namely, we prove that if $p\mu_p(\partial A) \leq \mu_p(A) (\log_p(\mu_p(A))+\epsilon)$,
then there exists a subcube $C$ such that $\mu_p(A \Delta C)/\mu_p(A) = O(\epsilon' /\log(1/\epsilon'))$,
where $\epsilon' =\epsilon \ln (1/p)$. This result is a central component in recent work of the authors
proving sharp stability versions of a number of Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorems in extremal combinatorics,
including the seminal `complete intersection theorem' of Ahlswede and Khachatrian. In addition,
we prove a biased-measure analogue of the `full' edge isoperimetric inequality, for monotone increasing
sets, and we observe that such an analogue does not hold for arbitrary sets, hence answering a question
of Kalai. We use this result to give a new proof of the `full' edge isoperimetric inequality, one relying
on the Kruskal-Katona theorem.
