The Devaney, Li-Yorke and distributional chaos in plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ can occur in the continuous
dynamical system generated by Euler equation branching. Euler equation branching is a type of differential
inclusion $\dot x \in \{f(x),g(x) \} $, where $f,g:X \subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$
are continuous and $f(x) \neq g(x)$ in every point $x \in X$. Stockman and Raines (Stockman, D. R.;
Raines, B. R.: Chaotic sets and Euler equation branching, Journal of Mathematical Economics, 2010,
Volume 46, pp. 1173-1193) defined so-called chaotic set in plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ which existence
leads to an existence of Devaney, Li-Yorke and distributional chaos. In this paper, we follow up
on Stockman, Raines and we show that chaos in plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ with two "classical" (with non-zero
determinant of Jacobi's matrix) hyperbolic singular points of both branches not lying in the same
point in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is always admitted. But the chaos existence is caused also by set of solutions
of Euler equation branching which have to fulfil conditions following from the definition of so-called
chaotic set. So, we research this set of solutions. In the second part we create new overall macroeconomic
equilibrium model called IS-LM/QY-ML. The construction of this model follows from the fundamental
macroeconomic equilibrium model called IS-LM but we include every important economic phenomena
like inflation effect, endogenous money supply, economic cycle etc. in contrast with the original
IS-LM model. We research the dynamical behaviour of this new IS-LM/QY-ML model and show when a chaos
exists with relevant economic interpretation.
