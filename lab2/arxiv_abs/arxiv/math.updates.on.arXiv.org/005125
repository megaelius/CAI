Reaction networks are mainly used to model the time-evolution of molecules of interacting chemical
species. Stochastic models are typically used when the counts of the molecules are low, whereas
deterministic models are used when the counts are in high abundance. In 2011, the notion of `tiers'
was introduced to study the long time behavior of deterministically modeled reaction networks
that are weakly reversible and have a single linkage class. This `tier' based argument was analytical
in nature. Later, in 2014, the notion of a strongly endotactic network was introduced in order to
generalize the previous results from weakly reversible networks with a single linkage class to
this wider family of networks. The point of view of this later work was more geometric and algebraic
in nature. The notion of strongly endotactic networks was later used in 2018 to prove a large deviation
principle for a class of stochastically modeled reaction networks. We provide an analytical characterization
of strongly endotactic networks in terms of tier structures. By doing so, we shed light on the connection
between the two points of view, and also make available a new proof technique for the study of strongly
endotactic networks. We show the power of this new technique in two distinct ways. First, we demonstrate
how the main previous results related to strongly endotactic networks, both for the deterministic
and stochastic modeling choices, can be quickly obtained from our characterization. Second, we
demonstrate how new results can be obtained by proving that a sub-class of strongly endotactic networks,
when modeled stochastically, is positive recurrent. Finally, and similarly to recent independent
work by Agazzi and Mattingly, we provide an example which closes a conjecture in the negative by showing
that stochastically modeled strongly endotactic networks can be transient (and even explosive).
