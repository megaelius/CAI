The capability to incorporate moving geometric features within models for complex simulations
is a common requirement in many fields. The fluid mechanics within aeronautical applications,
for example, routinely feature rotating (e.g. turbines, wheels and fan blades) or sliding components
(e.g. in compressor or turbine cascade simulations). With an increasing trend towards the high-fidelity
modelling of these cases, in particular combined with the use of high-order discontinuous Galerkin
methods, there is therefore a requirement to understand how different numerical treatments of
the interfaces between the static mesh and the sliding/rotating part impact on overall solution
quality. In this article, we compare two different approaches to handle this non-conformal interface.
The first is the so-called mortar approach, where flux integrals along edges are split according
to the positioning of the non-conformal grid. The second is a lesser-documented point-to-point
interpolation method, where the interior and exterior quantities for flux evaluations are interpolated
from elements lying on the opposing side of the interface. Although the mortar approach has advantages
in terms of its numerical properties, in that it preserves the local conservation properties of
DG methods, in the context of complex 3D meshes it poses significant implementation difficulties
which the point-to-point method handles more readily. In this article we examine the numerical
properties of each method, focusing not only on observing convergence orders for smooth solutions,
but also how each method performs in under-resolved simulations of linear and nonlinear hyperbolic
problems, to inform the use of these methods in implicit large-eddy simulations.
