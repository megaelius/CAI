Motivated by the theory of weighted shifts on directed trees and its multivariable counterpart,
we address the question of identifying commutant and reflexivity of the multiplication $d$-tuple
$\mathscr M_z$ on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathscr H$ of $E$-valued holomorphic functions
on $\Omega$, where $E$ is a separable Hilbert space and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb C^d$
admitting bounded approximation by polynomials. In case $E$ is a finite dimensional cyclic subspace
for $\mathscr M_z$, under some natural conditions on the $B(E)$-valued kernel associated with
$\mathscr H$, the commutant of $\mathscr M_z$ is shown to be the algebra $H^{\infty}_{_{B(E)}}(\Omega)$
of bounded holomorphic $B(E)$-valued functions on $\Omega$, provided $\mathscr M_z$ satisfies
the matrix-valued von Neumann's inequality. This generalizes a classical result of Shields and
Wallen (the case of $\dim E=1$ and $d=1$). As an application, we determine the commutant of a Bergman
shift on a leafless, locally finite, rooted directed tree $\mathscr T$ of finite branching index.
As the second main result of this paper, we show that a multiplication $d$-tuple $\mathscr M_z$ on
$\mathscr H$ satisfying the von Neumann's inequality is reflexive. This extends a result of McCarthy
(the case of $\dim E=1$ and $\mathscr M_z$ being joint subnormal). It also provides several new classes
of examples as well as recovers special cases of various known results in one and several variables.
We also exhibit a family of tri-diagonal $B(\mathbb C^2)$-valued kernels for which the associated
multiplication operators $\mathscr M_z$ are non-hyponormal reflexive operators with commutants
equal to $H^{\infty}_{_{B(\mathbb C^2)}}(\mathbb D)$.
