We derive some Bott-Chern-Aeppli cohomology for (non-Kahler) compact complex manifolds. We also
show that for a compact complex $n$-fold, the hodge numbers of the Frolicher spectral sequence terms
can be given in terms of information from decompositions of the Aeppli cohomology. We then show that
if one of the decomposition terms, $L^{n-1,n-1}_\partial$, is zero, then every hermitian metric
is conformal to a strongly Gauduchon metric. As a corollary,we duplicate a result already shown
by Popovici and Ugarte\cite{PopoviciUgarte}: if a compact complex maniflod, $X$, has $h^{0,1}_{\bar{\partial}}
= h^{0,1}_{BC}$, then every hermitian metric is conformal to a strongly Gauduchon metric. We show
(which is essentially given by Tosatti\cite{Tosatti}) that $$h^{1,1}_{BC}={\check{h}}^1({\mathcal{PH}})=
2h^{0,1}_{\bar{\partial}}-b^1 + dim_{\mathbb{R}}(H^{1,1}_{dR}({\mathbb{R}}))$$ where
${\mathcal{PH}}$ is the sheaf of pluri-harmonic functions on $X$ and $H^{1,1}_{dR}({\mathbb{R}})$
is the subgroup of $H^2_dR(X,{\mathbb{R}})$ consisting of classes with a real $d$-closed $1,1$-form
as a representative. We finally give the complete Bott-Chern-Aeppli cohomology for compact complex
3-folds in terms of the hodge numbers of Dolbeault cohomology, Frolicher spectral sequence terms,
a bi-degree DeRham-like type of cohomology, $K^{p,q}$ defined as $$ K^{p,q} = \frac{ker( \partial
) \cap ker( {\bar{\partial}}) }{im( \partial )\cap ker( {\bar{\partial}} ) + im( {\bar{\partial}})\cap
ker( \partial )} $$ and ${\check{H}}^1({\mathcal{PH}})$. Along the way we give the complete Bott-Chern-Aeppli
cohomology for a hypothetical complex structure on $S^6$ in terms of Dolbeault and Frolicher hodge
numbers. Finally, we show agreement of our results with the calculation by Angella\cite{Angella}
of the Bott-Chern-Aeppli cohomology for small Kuranishi deformations of the Iwasawa manifold.
