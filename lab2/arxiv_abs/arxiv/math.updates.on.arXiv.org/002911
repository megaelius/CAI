We propose a downlink beamforming scheme that combines spatial division and orthogonal space-time
block coding (OSTBC) in multi-user massive MIMO systems. The beamformer is divided into two parts:
a pre-beamforming matrix to separate the users into different beams with no interference between
each other, which is designed based on the low rank covariance matrix of the downlink channel, and
a linear precoding matrix using partial or even no channel state information (CSI) concatenated
by an OSTBC. To construct the pre-beamforming matrix, a simple method that selects columns from
DFT matrix is presented. To design the linear precoding matrix with partial CSI of the effective
channel after the pre-beamforming, we solve an optimization problem to minimize the pairwise error
probability (PEP) of the users under an individual power or sum power constraint, respectively.
For the individual power constraint, a semi-definite relaxing (SDR) method with a sufficient condition
achieving the globally optimal solution is proposed to provide a performance benchmark. In addition,
an efficient iterative successive convex approximation (SCA) method is provided to achieve a suboptimal
solution. Furthermore, closed form solutions are derived under some special cases. For the sum
power constraint, we consider two different designs, i.e., minimizing the average PEP and minimizing
the maximum PEP of all users. We find that both non-convex problems have a similar structure, and
proposed a unified SCA-Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to handle
them. The SCA-ADMM method can be implemented in a parallel manner, and thus is with great efficiency.
Simulation results show the efficiency of our proposed JSDD scheme and the optimization method.
