In contrast to normal diffusion, there is no canonical model for reactions between chemical species
which move by anomalous subdiffusion. Indeed, the type of mesoscopic equation describing reaction-subdiffusion
depends on subtle assumptions about the microscopic behavior of individual molecules. Furthermore,
the correspondence between mesoscopic and microscopic models is not well understood. In this paper,
we study the subdiffusion-limited model, which is defined by mesoscopic equations with fractional
derivatives applied to both the movement and the reaction terms. Assuming that the reaction terms
are affine functions, we show that the solution to the fractional system is the expectation of a random
time change of the solution to the corresponding integer order system. This result yields a simple
and explicit algebraic relationship between the fractional and integer order solutions in Laplace
space. We then find the microscopic Langevin description of individual molecules that corresponds
to such mesoscopic equations and give a computer simulation method to generate their stochastic
trajectories. This analysis identifies some precise microscopic conditions that dictate when
this type of mesoscopic model is or is not appropriate. We apply our results to several scenarios
in cell biology which, despite the ubiquity of subdiffusion in cellular environments, have been
modeled almost exclusively by normal diffusion. Specifically, we consider subdiffusive models
of morphogen gradient formation, fluctuating mobility, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP) experiments. We also apply our results to fractional ordinary differential equations.
