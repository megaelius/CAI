Three algorithms are developed for uncertainty quantification in modeling coupled Stokes and
Darcy flows. The porous media may consist of multiple regions with different properties. The permeability
is modeled as a non-stationary stochastic variable, with its log represented as a sum of local Karhunen-Lo\`eve
(KL) expansions. The problem is approximated by stochastic collocation on either tensor-product
or sparse grids, coupled with a multiscale mortar mixed finite element method for the spatial discretization.
A non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm reduces the global problem to a coarse scale
mortar interface problem, which is solved by an iterative solver, for each stochastic realization.
In the traditional implementation, each subdomain solves a local Dirichlet or Neumann problem
in every interface iteration. To reduce this cost, two additional algorithms based on deterministic
or stochastic multiscale flux basis are introduced. The basis consists of the local flux (or velocity
trace) responses from each mortar degree of freedom. It is computed by each subdomain independently
before the interface iteration begins. The use of the multiscale flux basis avoids the need for subdomain
solves on each iteration. The deterministic basis is computed at each stochastic collocation and
used only at this realization. The stochastic basis is formed by further looping over all local realizations
of a subdomain's KL region before the stochastic collocation begins. It is reused over multiple
realizations. Numerical tests are presented to illustrate the performance of the three algorithms,
with the stochastic multiscale flux basis showing significant savings in computational cost.
