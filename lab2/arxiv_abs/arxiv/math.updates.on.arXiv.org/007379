A classical result due to Diers shows that a copresheaf $F\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{Set}$
on a category $\mathcal{A}$ is a coproduct of representables precisely when each connected component
of $F$'s category of elements has an initial object. Most often, this condition is imposed on a copresheaf
of the form $\mathcal{B}\left(X,T-\right)$ for a functor $T\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$,
in which case this property says that $T$ admits generic factorizations at $X$, or equivalently
that $T$ is familial at $X$. Here we generalize these results to the two-dimensional setting, replacing
$\mathcal{A}$ with an arbitrary bicategory $\mathscr{A}$, and $\mathbf{Set}$ with $\mathbf{Cat}$.
In this two-dimensional setting, simply asking that a pseudofunctor $F\colon\mathscr{A}\to\mathbf{Cat}$
be a coproduct of representables is often too strong of a condition. Instead, we will only ask that
$F$ be a lax conical colimit of representables. This in turn allows for the weaker notion of lax generic
factorizations (and lax familial representability) for pseudofunctors of bicategories $T\colon\mathscr{A}\to\mathscr{B}$.
We also compare our lax familial pseudofunctors to Weber's familial 2-functors, finding our description
is more general (not requiring a terminal object in $\mathscr{A}$), though essentially equivalent
when a terminal object does exist. Moreover, our description of lax generics allows for an equivalence
between lax generic factorizations and lax familial representability. Finally, we characterize
our lax familial pseudofunctors as right lax $\mathsf{F}$-adjoints followed by locally discrete
fibrations of bicategories, which in turn yields a simple definition of parametric right adjoint
pseudofunctors.
