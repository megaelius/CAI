We investigate the localization transition for a simple model of interface which interacts with
an inhomonegeous defect plane. The interface is modeled by the graph of a function $\phi: \mathbb
Z^2 \to \mathbb Z$, the disorder being given by a fixed realization of a field of IID centered random
variables $(\omega_x)_{x\in \mathbb Z^2}$. The Hamiltonian of the system is given by the expression
$$\mathcal H(\phi):= \beta\sum_{x\sim y} |\phi(x)-\phi(y)|- \sum_{x} (\alpha\omega_x+h){\bf
1}_{\{\phi(x)=0\}},$$ where $\alpha,\beta>0$ are fixed parameters which determine the intensity
of nearest neighbor interaction and the amplitude of disorder while $h\in \mathbb R$ corresponds
to the mean value of the interaction with the substrate. We focus on the case of large $\beta$ which
corresponds to the rigidity phase of the Solid-On-Solid (SOS) model. For $\beta$ sufficiently
large, we provide a sharp description of the phase transition, occurring when the parameter $h$
varies, from a localized phased where a positive fraction of the points sit at level $0$ from a delocalized
one where $\phi$ is macroscopically repelled by the interface. We prove that the critical value
for $h$ is given by $h_c(\alpha)= -\log \mathbb E[e^{\alpha \omega}]$, and that near the critical
point, the free energy displays the following critical behavior $$F_\beta(\alpha,h_c+u )\stackrel{u\to
0+}{\sim} \max_{n\ge 1} \left\{\theta_1 e^{-4\beta n} u- \frac{1}{2}\theta^2_1 e^{-8\beta
n} \frac{\mathrm{Var}\left[e^{\alpha \omega}\right]}{\mathbb E \left[ e^{\alpha \omega}
\right]^2}\right\}.$$ The positive constant $\theta_1(\beta)>0$ is defined by the asymptotic
probability of spikes for the infinite volume SOS with $0$ boundary condition $\theta_1(\beta):=\lim_{n\to
\infty} e^{4\beta n}\mathbf P_{\beta} (\phi({\bf 0})=n)$.
