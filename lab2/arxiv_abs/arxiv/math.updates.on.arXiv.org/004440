Sturmian sequences are the most simple aperiodic sequences. A result of Morse, Hedlund (1940) and
Coven, Hedlund (1970) is that a biinfinite binary sequence is sturmian if and only if it is obtained
as the coding of an irrational rotation on the circle $\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. The
reason is that sturmian sequences and codings of rotations have the same substitutive structure.
The proof is related to the continued fraction expansion of real numbers and is based on induced maps.
We consider a generalization of this result in the context of the most simple aperiodic two-dimensional
sequences, namely Wang shifts defined by the fewest number of tiles. We prove that the Jeandel-Rao's
Wang shift, an aperiodic Wang shift defined by only 11 Wang tiles, has the same substitutive structure
as the symbolic dynamical system defined by the action of some $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotation and partition
of the $2$-torus. The proof is algorithmic and is based on the induction of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotations
and partitions of the $2$-torus. As for continued fraction expansion of quadratic irrationals,
the algorithm stops when it gets a partition and a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action which is the same as in an
earlier step up to some renormalization. This is what happens with the partition of the $2$-torus
coding Jeandel-Rao's aperiodic tilings. After few induction steps that we may call preperiod,
we obtain a self-induced Markov partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ coding a self-similar Wang shift defined
by 19 Wang tiles. The substitution of the self-similarity is the same as the one previously known
and computed from the 19 Wang tiles using marker tiles.
