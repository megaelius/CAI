An enumerative invariant theory in Algebraic Geometry, Differential Geometry, or Representation
Theory, is the study of invariants which 'count' $\tau$-(semi)stable objects $E$ with fixed topological
invariants $[E]=\alpha$ in some geometric problem, by means of a virtual class $[{\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm
ss}(\tau)]_{\rm virt}$ in some homology theory for the moduli spaces ${\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm
st}(\tau)\subseteq{\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm ss}(\tau)$ of $\tau$-(semi)stable objects. Examples
include Mochizuki's invariants counting coherent sheaves on surfaces, Donaldson-Thomas type
invariants counting coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 3- and 4-folds and Fano 3-folds, and Donaldson
invariants of 4-manifolds. We make conjectures on new universal structures common to many enumerative
invariant theories. Any such theory has two moduli spaces ${\mathcal M},{\mathcal M}^{\rm pl}$,
where the second author gives $H_*({\mathcal M})$ the structure of a graded vertex algebra, and
$H_*({\mathcal M}^{\rm pl})$ a graded Lie algebra, closely related to $H_*({\mathcal M})$. The
virtual classes $[{\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm ss}(\tau)]_{\rm virt}$ take values in $H_*({\mathcal
M}^{\rm pl})$. In most such theories, defining $[{\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm ss}(\tau)]_{\rm virt}$
when ${\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm st}(\tau)\ne{\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm ss}(\tau)$ (in gauge
theory, when the moduli space contains reducibles) is a difficult problem. We conjecture that there
is a natural way to define $[{\mathcal M}_\alpha^{\rm ss}(\tau)]_{\rm virt}$ in homology over
$\mathbb Q$, and that the resulting classes satisfy a universal wall-crossing formula under change
of stability condition $\tau$, written using the Lie bracket on $H_*({\mathcal M}^{\rm pl})$.
We prove our conjectures for moduli spaces of representations of quivers without oriented cycles.
