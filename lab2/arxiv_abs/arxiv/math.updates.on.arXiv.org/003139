In this article, we prove that for a finite quiver $Q$ the equivalence class of a potential up to formal
change of variables of the complete path algebra $\widehat{\mathbb{C} Q}$, is determined by its
Jacobi algebra together with the class in its 0-th Hochschild homology represented by the potential
assuming it is finite dimensional. This result can be viewed as a noncommutative analogue of the
famous theorem of Mather and Yau on isolated hypersurface singularities. We also prove that the
equivalence class of a potential is determined by its sufficiently high jet assuming the Jacobi
algebra is finite dimensional. These results have several interesting applications. First, we
show that if the Jacobi algebra is finite dimensional then the corresponding complete Ginzburg
dg-algebra, and the (topological) generalized cluster category thereof, are determined by the
isomorphic type of the Jacobi algebra together with the class in its 0-th Hochschild homology represented
by the potential. The contraction algebras associated to three dimensional flopping contractions
provide a class of examples of finite dimensional Jacobi algebras. As the second application, we
prove that the contraction algebra together with the class in its 0-th Hochschild homology represented
by the potential determines the relative singularity category defined by Kalck and Yang and the
classical singularity category of Buchweitz and Orlov. This result provides an evidence for Donovan-Wemyss
conjecture, which asserts that the contraction algebra is a complete invariant for the underlying
singularities of three dimensional flopping contractions.
