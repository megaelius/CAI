We extend certain classical theorems in pluripotential theory to a class of functions defined on
the support of a $(1,1)$-closed positive current $T$, analogous to plurisubharmonic functions,
called $T$-plurisubharmonic functions. These functions are defined as limits, on the support
of $T$, of sequences of plurisubharmonic functions decreasing on this support. In particular,
we show that the poles of such functions are pluripolar sets. We also show that the maximum principle
and the Hartogs's theorem remain valid in a weak sense. We study these functions by means of a class
of measures, so-called "pluri-Jensen measures", about which we prove that they are numerous on
the support of $(1,1)$-closed positive currents. These measures, for $T$-plurisubharmonic functions,
are analogous to the Lebesgue's measure on a disk for plurisubharmonic functions. We also obtain,
for any fat compact set, an expression of its relative Green's function in terms of an infimum of an
integral over a set of pluri-Jensen measures. We then deduce, by means of these measures, a characterization
of the polynomially convex fat compact sets, as well as a characterization of pluripolar sets, and
the fact that the support of a closed positive $(1,1)$-current is nowhere pluri-thin. In the second
part of this article, these tools are used to study dynamics of a certain class of automomorphisms
of $\mathbb{C}^n$ which naturally generalize Henon's automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$. First
we study the geometry of the support of canonical invariant currents. Then we obtain an equidistribution
result for the convergence of pull-back of certain measures towards a canonical invariant measure.
This invariant measure appears to be ergodic, with compact support.
