Fluid-structure systems occur in a range of scientific and engineering applications. The immersed
boundary method is a widely recognized and effective modeling paradigm for simulating fluid-structure
interaction in such systems, but a difficulty of the IB formulation of these problems is that the
pressure and viscous stress are generally discontinuous at fluid-solid interfaces. The conventional
IB method regularizes these discontinuities, which typically yields low-order accuracy at these
interfaces. The immersed interface method is an IB-like approach to FSI that sharply imposes stress
jump conditions, enabling higher-order accuracy, but prior applications of the IIM have been largely
restricted to cases with smooth geometries. This paper introduces an immersed interface formulation
that sharply resolves stress discontinuities along immersed boundaries while enabling the use
of general interfacial geometries described by faceted surfaces that are amenable to nodal ($C^0$)
finite element discretizations. Verification examples for models with prescribed interface
motion demonstrate the performance of the methodology. Our results also demonstrate that only
the lowest-order jump conditions for the pressure and velocity gradient are required to realize
global second-order accuracy with the IIM. Specifically, we demonstrate second-order global
convergence rates along with nearly second-order local convergence in the Eulerian velocity field,
and between first-~and second-order global convergence rates along with approximately first-order
local convergence for the Eulerian pressure field. We also demonstrate approximately second-order
local convergence in the interfacial displacement and velocity along with first-order local convergence
in the fluid traction along the interface.
