Ba\~nuelos and Bogdan (2004) and Bogdan, Palmowski and Wang (2016) analyse the asymptotic tail
distribution of the first time a stable (L\'evy) process in dimension $d\geq 2$ exists a cone. We
use these results to develop the notion of a stable process conditioned to remain in a cone as well
as the the notion of a stable process conditioned to absorb continuously at the apex of a cone (without
leaving the cone). As self-similar Markov processes we examine some of their fundamental properties
through the lens of its Lamperti-Kiu decomposition. In particular we are interested to understand
the underlying structure of the Markov additive process that drives such processes. As a consequence
of our interrogation of the underlying MAP, we are able to provide an answer by example to the open
question: If the modulator of a MAP has a stationary distribution, under what conditions does its
ascending ladder MAP have a stationary distribution? We show how the two forms of conditioning are
dual to one another. Moreover, we construct the null-recurrent extension of the stable process
killed on exiting a cone, showing that it again remains in the class of self-similar Markov processes.
In the spirit of several very recent works, the results presented here show that many previously
unknown results of stable processes, which have long since been understood for Brownian motion,
or are easily proved for Brownian motion, become accessible by appealing to the notion of the stable
process as a self-similar Markov process, in addition to its special status as a L\'evy processes
with a semi-tractable potential analysis.
