We study higher-order space-time variational discretisations for modeling complex processes
in porous media that include fluid and structure interactions which are of fundamental importance
in many engineering fields with applications in subsurface processes, battery-design and biomechanics.
For the discretisation in time we deploy discontinuous Galerkin dG(r) and continuous Galerkin
cG(q) discretisation families. Moreover we introduce a new coupled dG(r)-cG(q) mixed time discretisation
and show numerically the stability advantages in the case of incompatible initial data under massively
reduced computational costs. For the discretisation in space we use a mixed finite element method
for the flow problem to ensure local mass conservation and a continuous Galerkin method for the mechanics.
We consider solving sequentially the coupling of flow and mechanics with the fixed-stress iterative
approach such that we can reuse our system solver and preconditioning technologies for the arising
block system matrices from higher-order in time discretisations. Numerical experiments show
firstly the undeniable advantages of discontinuous Galerkin time discretisations dG(0) and dG(1)
over the continuous Galerkin time discretisation cG(1) in the case of incompatible initial data,
secondly the advantages of the new coupled dG(1)-cG(1) in time approach in the case of incompatible
initial data with massively reduced computational costs and better accuracy compared to the dG(1)
time discretisation and thirdly the performance and efficiency differences of the dG(0), cG(1),
dG(1) and the new dG(1)-cG(1) fixed-stress solver approaches for a sophisticated and physically
relevant three-dimensional numerical example.
