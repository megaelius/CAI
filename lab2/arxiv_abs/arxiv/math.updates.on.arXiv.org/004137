We propose a localized divide and conquer algorithm for inverse factorization $S^{-1} = ZZ^*$ of
Hermitian positive definite matrices $S$ with localized structure, e.g. exponential decay with
respect to some given distance function on the index set of $S$. The algorithm is a reformulation
of recursive inverse factorization [J. Chem. Phys., 128 (2008), 104105] but makes use of localized
operations only. At each level of recursion, the problem is cut into two subproblems and their solutions
are combined using iterative refinement [Phys. Rev. B, 70 (2004), 193102] to give a solution to the
original problem. The two subproblems can be solved in parallel without any communication and,
using the localized formulation, the cost of combining their results is proportional to the cut
size, defined by the binary partition of the index set. This means that for cut sizes increasing as
$o(n)$ with system size $n$ the cost of combining the two subproblems is negligible compared to the
overall cost for sufficiently large systems. We also present an alternative derivation of iterative
refinement based on a sign matrix formulation, analyze the stability, and propose a parameterless
stopping criterion. We present bounds for the initial factorization error and the number of iterations
in terms of the condition number of $S$ when the starting guess is given by the solution of the two subproblems
in the binary recursion. These bounds are used in theoretical results for the decay properties of
the involved matrices. The localization properties of our algorithms are demonstrated for matrices
corresponding to nearest neighbor overlap on one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices as well
as basis set overlap matrices generated using the Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional
theory electronic structure program Ergo [SoftwareX, 7 (2018), 107].
