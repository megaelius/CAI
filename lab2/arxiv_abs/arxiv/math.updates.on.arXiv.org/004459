Consider a locally compact group $G=Q\ltimes V$ such that $V$ is abelian and the action of $Q$ on the
dual abelian group $\hat V$ has a free orbit of full measure. We show that such a group $G$ can be quantized
in three equivalent ways: (1) by reflecting across the Galois object defined by the canonical irreducible
representation of $G$ on $L^2(V)$; (2) by twisting the coproduct on the group von Neumann algebra
of $G$ by a dual $2$-cocycle obtained from the $G$-equivariant Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of
$V\times\hat V$; (3) by considering the bicrossed product defined by a matched pair of subgroups
of $Q\ltimes\hat V$ both isomorphic to $Q$. In the simplest case of the $ax+b$ group over the reals,
the dual cocycle in (2) is an analytic analogue of the Jordanian twist. It was first found by Stachura
using different ideas. The equivalence of approaches (2) and (3) in this case implies that the quantum
$ax+b$ group of Baaj-Skandalis is isomorphic to the quantum group defined by Stachura. Along the
way we prove a number of results for arbitrary locally compact groups $G$. Using recent results of
De Commer we show that a class of $G$-Galois objects is parametrized by certain cohomology classes
in $H^2(G;\mathbb T)$. This extends results of Wassermann and Davydov in the finite group case.
A new phenomenon is that already the unit class in $H^2(G;\mathbb T)$ can correspond to a nontrivial
Galois object. Specifically, we show that any nontrivial locally compact group $G$ with group von
Neumann algebra a factor of type I admits a canonical cohomology class of dual $2$-cocycles such
that the corresponding quantization of $G$ is neither commutative nor cocommutative.
