The goal of the present paper is to push Sz.-Nagy--Foias model theory for a completely nonunitary
Hilbert-space contraction operator $T$, to the case of a commuting pair of contraction operators
$(T_1, T_2)$ having product $T = T_1 T_2$ which is completely nonunitary. The idea is to use the Sz.-Nagy-Foias
functional model for $T$ as the model space also for the commutative tuple ($T_1, T_2)$ with $T = T_1
T_2$ equal to the usual Sz.-Nagy--Foias model operator, and identify what added structure is required
to classify such commutative contractive factorizations $T = T_1 T_2$ up to unitary equivalence.
In addition to the characteristic function $\Theta_T$, we identify additional invariants $({\mathbb
G}, {\mathbb W})$ which can be used to construct a functional model for the commuting pair $(T_1,
T_2)$ and which have good uniqueness properties: if two commutative contractive pairs $(T_1, T_2)$
and $(T'_1, T'_2)$ are unitarily equivalent, then their characteristic triples $(\Theta, {\mathbb
G}, {\mathbb W})_T$ and $(\Theta, {\mathbb G}, {\mathbb W})_{T'}$ coincide in a natural sense.
We illustrate the theory with several simple cases where the characteristic triples can be explicitly
computed. This work extends earlier results of Berger-Coburn-Lebow \cite{B-C-L} for the case
where $(T_1, T_2)$ is a pair of commuting isometries, and of Das-Sarkar \cite{D-S}, Das-Sarkar-Sarkar
\cite{D-S-S} and the second author \cite{sauAndo} for the case where $T = T_1T_2$ is pure (the operator
sequence $T^{*n}$ tends strongly to $0$). Finally we use the model to study the structure of joint
invariant subspaces for a commutative, contractive operator pair, extending results of Sz.-Nagy--Foias
for the single-operator case.
