Let $M$ be a stratum of a compact stratified space $A$. It is equipped with a general adapted metric
$g$, which is slightly more general than the adapted metrics of Nagase and Brasselet-Hector-Saralegi.
In particular, $g$ has a general type, which is an extension of the type of an adapted metric. A restriction
on this general type is assumed, and then $g$ is called good. We consider the maximum/minimun ideal
boundary condition, $d_{\text{\rm max/min}}$, of the compactly supported de~Rham complex on
$M$, in the sense of Br\"uning-Lesch. Let $H^*_{\text{\rm max/min}}(M)$ and $\Delta_{\text{\rm
max/min}}$ denote the cohomology and Laplacian of $d_{\text{\rm max/min}}$. The first main theorem
states that $\Delta_{\text{\rm max/min}}$ has a discrete spectrum satisfying a weak form of the
Weyl's asymptotic formula. The second main theorem is a version of Morse inequalities using $H_{\text{\rm
max/min}}^*(M)$ and what we call rel-Morse functions. An ingredient of the proofs of both theorems
is a version for $d_{\text{\rm max/min}}$ of the Witten's perturbation of the de~Rham complex.
Another ingredient is certain perturbation of the Dunkl harmonic oscillator previously studied
by the authors using classical perturbation theory. Assume that $A$ is a stratified pseudomanifold,
and consider its intersection homology $I^{\bar p}H_*(A)$ with perversity $\bar p$; in particular,
the lower and upper middle perversities are denoted by $\bar m$ and $\bar n$, respectively. Then,
for any perversity $\bar p\le\bar m$, there is an associated good adapted metric on $M$ satisfying
the Nagase isomorphism $H^r_{\text{\rm max}}(M)\cong I^{\bar p}H_r(A)^*$ ($r\in\N$). If $M$
is oriented and $\bar p\ge\bar n$, we also get $H^r_{\text{\rm min}}(M)\cong I^{\bar p}H_r(A)$.
Thus our version of the Morse inequalities can be described in terms of $I^{\bar p}H_*(A)$.
