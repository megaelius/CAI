This paper presents some new results on the conditional joint probability distributions of phase-type
under the mixture of right-continuous Markov jump processes with absorption on the same finite
state space $\mathbb{S}$ moving at different speeds, where the mixture occurs at a random time.
Such mixture was first proposed by Frydman \cite{Frydman2005} and Frydman and Schuermann \cite{Frydman2008}
as a generalization of the mover-stayer model of Blumen et at. \cite{Blumen}, and was recently extended
by Surya \cite{Surya2018}. When conditioning on all previous and current information $\mathcal{F}_{t,i}=\mathcal{F}_{t-}\cup\{X_t=i\}$,
with $\mathcal{F}_{t-}=\{X_s, 0<s\leq t-\}$ and $i\in\mathbb{S}$, of the mixture process $X$,
distributional identities are explicit in terms of the Bayesian updates of switching probability,
the likelihoods of observing the sample paths, and the intensity matrices of the underlying Markov
processes, despite the fact that the mixture itself is non-Markov. They form non-stationary function
of time and have the ability to capture heterogeneity and path dependence. When the underlying processes
move at the same speed, in which case the mixture reduces to a simple Markov jump process, these features
are removed, and the distributions coincide with that of given by Neuts \cite{Neuts1975} and Assaf
et al. \cite{Assaf1984}. Furthermore, when conditioning on $\mathcal{F}_{t-}$ and no exit to
the absorbing set has been observed at time $t$, the distributions are given explicitly in terms
of an additional Bayesian updates of probability distribution of $X$ on $\mathbb{S}$. Examples
are given to illustrate the main results.
