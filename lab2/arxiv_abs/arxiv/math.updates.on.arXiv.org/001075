A subfamily $\{F_1,F_2,\dots,F_{|P|}\}\subseteq {\cal F}$ of sets is a copy of a poset $P$ in ${\cal
F}$ if there exists a bijection $\phi:P\rightarrow \{F_1,F_2,\dots,F_{|P|}\}$ such that whenever
$x \le_P x'$ holds, then so does $\phi(x)\subseteq \phi(x')$. For a family ${\cal F}$ of sets, let
$c(P,{\cal F})$ denote the number of copies of $P$ in ${\cal F}$, and we say that ${\cal F}$ is $P$-free
if $c(P,{\cal F})=0$ holds. For any two posets $P,Q$ let us denote by $La(n,P,Q)$ the maximum number
of copies of $Q$ over all $P$-free families ${\cal F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, i.e. $\max\{c(Q,{\cal
F}): {\cal F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}, c(P,{\cal F})=0 \}$. This generalizes the well-studied parameter
$La(n,P)=La(n,P,P_1)$ where $P_1$ is the one element poset. The quantity $La(n,P)$ has been determined
(precisely or asymptotically) for many posets $P$, and in all known cases an asymptotically best
construction can be obtained by taking as many middle levels as possible without creating a copy
of $P$. In this paper we consider the first instances of the problem of determining $La(n,P,Q)$.
We find its value when $P$ and $Q$ are small posets, like chains, forks, the $N$ poset and diamonds.
Already these special cases show that the extremal families are completely different from those
in the original $P$-free cases: sometimes not middle or consecutive levels maximize $La(n,P,Q)$
and sometimes no asymptotically extremal family is the union of levels. Finally, we determine the
maximum number of copies of complete multi-level posets in $k$-Sperner families. The main tools
for this are the profile polytope method and two extremal set system problems that are of independent
interest: we maximize the number of $r$-tuples $A_1,A_2,\dots, A_r \in {\cal A}$ over all antichains
${\cal A}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ such that (i) $\cap_{i=1}^rA_i=\emptyset$, (ii) $\cap_{i=1}^rA_i=\emptyset$
and $\cup_{i=1}^rA_i=[n]$.
