The conformal barycenter of a point cloud on the sphere at infinity of the Poincar\'e ball model of
hyperbolic space is a hyperbolic analogue of the geometric median of a point cloud in Euclidean space.
It was defined by Douady and Earle as part of a construction of a conformally natural way to extend
homeomorphisms of the circle to homeomorphisms of the disk, and it plays a central role in Millson
and Kapovich's model of the configuration space of cyclic linkages with fixed edgelengths. In this
paper we consider the problem of computing the conformal barycenter. Abikoff and Ye have given an
iterative algorithm for measures on $\mathbb{S}^1$ which is guaranteed to converge. We analyze
Riemannian versions of Newton's method computed in the intrinsic geometry of the Poincare ball
model. We give Newton-Kantorovich (NK) conditions under which we show that Newton's method with
fixed step size is guaranteed to converge quadratically to the conformal barycenter for measures
on any $\mathbb{S}^d$ (including infinite-dimensional spheres). For measures given by $n$ atoms
on a finite dimensional sphere which obey the NK conditions, we give an explicit linear bound on the
computation time required to approximate the conformal barycenter to fixed error. We prove that
our NK conditions hold for all but exponentially few $n$ atom measures. For all measures with a unique
conformal barycenter we show that a regularized Newton's method with line search will always converge
(eventually superlinearly) to the conformal barycenter. Though we do not have hard time bounds
for this algorithm, experiments show that it is extremely efficient in practice and in particular
much faster than the Abikoff-Ye iteration.
