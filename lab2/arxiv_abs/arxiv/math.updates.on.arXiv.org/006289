Since demand in transportation networks is uncertain, commuters need to anticipate different
traffic conditions. We capture this uncertainty by assuming that each commuter may make the trip
or not with a fixed probability, creating an atomic congestion game with Bernoulli demands. Each
commuter participates with an exogenous probability $p_i\in[0,1]$, which is common knowledge,
independently of everybody else, or does not travel and incurs no cost. We first prove that the resulting
game is potential. Then we compute the parameterized price of anarchy to characterize the impact
of demand uncertainty on the efficiency of the transportation network. It turns out that the price
of anarchy as a function of the maximum participation probability $p=\max_{i} p_i$ is a nondecreasing
function. The worst case is attained when commuters have the same participation probabilities
$p_i\equiv p$. For the case of affine costs, we provide an analytic expression for the parameterized
price of anarchy as a function of $p$. This function is continuous on $(0,1]$, is equal to $4/3$ for
$0<p\leq 1/4$, and increases towards $5/2$ when $p\to 1$. Our work can be interpreted as providing
a continuous transition between the price of anarchy of nonatomic and atomic games, which are the
extremes of the price of anarchy function we characterize. The proofs are based on a non-trivial
use of the $(\lambda,\mu)$-smoothness framework where we optimize the parameters to get sharp
bounds for all possible values of $p$. We show that these bounds are tight and are attained on routing
games---as opposed to general congestion games---with purely linear costs (i.e., with no constant
terms).
