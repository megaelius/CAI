For positive integers $n$ and $r$ such that $r \leq \lfloor n/2\rfloor$, we let $V$ be a set of size
$n$ and let $\binom{V}{r}$ to denote the family of all subsets of $V$ of size $r$. In 1961, the famous
classical theorem, so called "Erd\H os-Ko-Rado", showed that the maximum size of subfamily of $\binom{V}{r}$
whose any two members intersect is $\binom{n - 1}{r - 1}$. They also rose the helpful technique so
called "compression operation" to organize the structure of the subfamily and yet preserving size
and intersecting property. This initiated many studies in extremal finite sets for example, in
1986, Pyber introduced the idea of cross intersecting families which aimed to find the maximum size
product between two subfamilies $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of $\binom{V}{r}$ when $A \cap
B \neq \emptyset$ for all $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B \in \mathcal{B}$. He found that $|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}|
\leq \binom{n - 1}{r - 1}^{2}$. In this paper, the aim is to find the maximum size product of cross intersecting
subfamilies $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of $\binom{V}{r}$ when $\mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B}
= \emptyset$. We give example of "disjoint" cross intersecting families which the compression
operation is not applicable. We develop new technique to prove that $|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}|\leq
\binom{n}{r}^{2}/4$ if $l = 0$ and $|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}| \leq (\binom{n}{r} - \binom{l}{p})^{2}/4$
if $l > 0$ when $|V| = n = 2r + l$ and $p = min\{r, \lceil \frac{l}{2}\rceil\}$. At the discussion, interestingly,
the asymptotic behavior of the maximum size product $|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}|$ is the same
as that of Pyber when $r$ is small comparing to $n$. That is $|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{B}| \leq \Theta(n^{2r
- 2})$ when $n$ is sufficiency large.
