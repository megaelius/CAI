The univariate extreme value theory deals with the convergence in type of powers of elements of sequences
of cumulative distribution functions on the real line when the power index gets infinite. In terms
of convergence of random variables, this amounts to the the weak convergence, in the sense of probability
measures weak convergence, of the partial maximas of a sequence of independent and identically
distributed random variables. In this monograph, this theory is comprehensively studied in the
broad frame of weak convergence of random vectors as exposed in Lo et al.(2016). It has two main parts.
The first is devoted to its nice mathematical foundation. Most of the materials of this part is taken
from the most essential Lo\`eve(1936,177) and Haan (1970), based on the stunning theory of regular,
pi or gamma variation. To prepare the statistical applications, a number contributions I made in
my PhD and my Doctorate of Sciences are added in the last chapter of the last chapter of that part. Our
real concern is to put these materials together with others, among them those of the authors from
his PhD dissertations and Science doctorate thesis, in a way to have an almost full coverage of the
theory on the real line that may serve as a master course of one semester in our universities. As well,
it will help the second part of the monograph. This second part will deal with statistical estimations
problems related to extreme values. It addresses various estimation questions and should be considered
as the beginning of a survey study to be updated progressively. Research questions are tackled therein.
Many results of the author, either unpublished or not sufficiently known, are stated and/or updated
therein.
