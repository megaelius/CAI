The paper has three goals. First, we want to generalize the classical concept of the branching property
so that it becomes applicable in historical and genealogical processes (using the coding of genealogies
by ultrametric measure spaces) and in articular complementing the corresponding concept of infinite
divisibility developed in [GGR18] for this context. Second the main point, we want to find a corresponding
characterization of the generators of branching processes respectively their martingale problems
which is both easy to apply and general enough to cover a wide range of state spaces. The third goal
is to get the branching property for genealogies marked with ancestral path, e.e. path-marked ultrametric
measure spaces. The starting point for all three points is the Feller diffusion model, the final
goal the super random walk model. We develop a framework covering above situations and questions
and leading to a new generator criterion. The state spaces suitable here are consistent collections
of topological semigroups each enriched with a collection of maps, the truncation maps all defined
on the state space of the process. This framework in particular includes processes taking values
in the space of marked ultrametric measure spaces and hence allows to treat historical information
and genealogies of spatial population models once genealogies are coded this way. We use this approach
to analyze in particular the tree-valued Feller diffusion (more precisely, equivalence class
of ultrametric measure space valued), various levels of genealogies in spatial models i.e. location-marked
versions of the former (as super random walk) and historical spatial branching processes or as a
third main point a new model (ancestral path-)marked genealogical super random walk as most general
model for genealogies of spatial populations in the mentioned coding.
