Inspired by the log Gromov-Witten (or GW) theory of Gross-Siebert/Abramovich-Chen, we introduce
a geometric notion of log J-holomorphic curve relative to a simple normal crossings symplectic
divisor defined in [FMZ1]. Every such moduli space is characterized by a second homology class,
genus, and contact data. For certain almost complex structures, we show that the moduli space of
stable log J-holomorphic curves of any fixed type is compact and metrizable with respect to an enhancement
of the Gromov topology. In the case of smooth symplectic divisors, our compactification is often
smaller than the relative compactification and there is a projection map from the latter onto the
former. The latter is constructed via expanded degenerations of the target. Our construction does
not need any modification of (or any extra structure on) the target. Unlike the classical moduli
spaces of stable maps, these log moduli spaces are often virtually singular. We describe an explicit
toric model for the normal cone (i.e. the space of gluing parameters) to each stratum in terms of the
defining combinatorial data of that stratum. In [FT2], we introduce a natural set up for studying
the deformation theory of log (and relative) curves and obtain a logarithmic analog of the space
of Ruan-Tian perturbations for these moduli spaces. In a forthcoming paper, we will prove a gluing
theorem for smoothing log curves in the normal direction to each stratum. With some modifications
to the theory of Kuranishi spaces, the latter will allow us to construct a virtual fundamental class
for every such log moduli space and define relative GW invariants without any restriction.
