In this paper, we consider a multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) network powered by wireless
power transfer (WPT), where each energy-harvesting WD follows a binary computation offloading
policy, i.e., data set of a task has to be executed as a whole either locally or remotely at the MEC server
via task offloading. In particular, we are interested in maximizing the (weighted) sum computation
rate of all the WDs in the network by jointly optimizing the individual computing mode selection
(i.e., local computing or offloading) and the system transmission time allocation (on WPT and task
offloading). The major difficulty lies in the combinatorial nature of multi-user computing mode
selection and its strong coupling with transmission time allocation. To tackle this problem, we
first consider a decoupled optimization, where we assume that the mode selection is given and propose
a simple bi-section search algorithm to obtain the conditional optimal time allocation. On top
of that, a coordinate descent method is devised to optimize the mode selection. The method is simple
in implementation but may suffer from high computational complexity in a large-size network. To
address this problem, we further propose a joint optimization method based on the ADMM (alternating
direction method of multipliers) decomposition technique, which enjoys much slower increase
of computational complexity as the networks size increases. Extensive simulations show that both
the proposed methods can efficiently achieve near-optimal performance under various network
setups, and significantly outperform the other representative benchmark methods considered.
