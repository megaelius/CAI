We consider coupled cell networks with asymmetric inputs and study their lattice of synchrony subspaces.
For the particular case of 1-input regular coupled cell networks we describe the join-irreducible
synchrony subspaces for their lattice of synchrony subspaces, first in terms of the eigenvectors
and generalized eigenvectors that generate them, and then by giving a characterization of the possible
patterns of the associated balanced colourings. The set of the join-irreducible synchrony subspaces
is join-dense for the lattice, that is, the lattice can be obtained by sums of those join-irreducible
elements (M. Aguiar, P. Ashwin, A. Dias, and M. Field. Dynamics of coupled cell networks: synchrony,
heteroclinic cycles and inflation, {\em J. Nonlinear Sci.} {\bf 21} (2) (2011) 271--323), and we
conclude about the possible patterns of balanced colourings associated to the synchrony subspaces
in the lattice. We also consider the disjoint union of two regular coupled cell networks with the
same cell-type and the same edge-type. We show how to obtain the lattice of synchrony subspaces for
the network union from the lattice of synchrony subspaces for the component networks. The lattice
of synchrony subspaces for a homogeneous coupled cell network is given by the intersection of the
lattice of synchrony subspaces for its identical-edge subnetworks per each edge-type (M. A. D.
Aguiar and A. P. S. Dias. The lattice of synchrony subspaces of a coupled cell network: Characterization
and computation algorithm, {\em Journal of Nonlinear Science}, {\bf 24} (6) (2014), 949--996).
This, together with the results in this paper, on the lattice of synchrony subspaces for 1-input
regular networks and on the lattice of synchrony subspaces for the disjoint union of networks, define
a procedure to obtain the lattice of synchrony subspaces for homogeneous coupled cell networks
with asymmetric inputs.
