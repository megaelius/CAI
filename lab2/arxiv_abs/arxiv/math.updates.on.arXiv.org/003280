In this paper we study detection and reconstruction of planted structures in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs. Motivated by a problem of communication security, we focus on planted structures
that consist in a tree graph. For planted line graphs, we establish the following phase diagram.
In a low density region where the average degree $\lambda$ of the initial graph is below some critical
value $\lambda_c=1$, detection and reconstruction go from impossible to easy as the line length
$K$ crosses some critical value $f(\lambda)\ln(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph.
In the high density region $\lambda>\lambda_c$, detection goes from impossible to easy as $K$ goes
from $o(\sqrt{n})$ to $\omega(\sqrt{n})$, and reconstruction remains impossible so long as $K=o(n)$.
For $D$-ary trees of varying depth $h$ and $2\le D\le O(1)$, we identify a low-density region $\lambda<\lambda_D$,
such that the following holds. There is a threshold $h*=g(D)\ln(\ln(n))$ with the following properties.
Detection goes from feasible to impossible as $h$ crosses $h*$. We also show that only partial reconstruction
is feasible at best for $h\ge h*$. We conjecture a similar picture to hold for $D$-ary trees as for
lines in the high-density region $\lambda>\lambda_D$, but confirm only the following part of this
picture: Detection is easy for $D$-ary trees of size $\omega(\sqrt{n})$, while at best only partial
reconstruction is feasible for $D$-ary trees of any size $o(n)$. These results are in contrast with
the corresponding picture for detection and reconstruction of {\em low rank} planted structures,
such as dense subgraphs and block communities: We observe a discrepancy between detection and reconstruction,
the latter being impossible for a wide range of parameters where detection is easy. This property
does not hold for previously studied low rank planted structures.
