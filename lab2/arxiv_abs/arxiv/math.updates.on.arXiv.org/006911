For a central, not necessarily reduced, hyperplane arrangement $f$ equipped with any factorization
$f = f_{1} \cdots f_{r}$ and for $f^{\prime}$ dividing $f$, we consider a more general type of Bernstein--Sato
ideal consisting of the polynomials $B(S) \in \mathbb{C}[s_{1}, \dots, s_{r}]$ satisfying the
functional equation $B(S) f^{\prime} f_{1}^{s_{1}} \cdots f_{r}^{s_{r}} \in \text{A}_{n}(\mathbb{C})[s_{1},
\dots, s_{r}] f_{1}^{s_{1} + 1} \cdots f_{r}^{s_{r} + 1}.$ Generalizing techniques due to Maisonobe,
we compute the zero locus of the standard Bernstein--Sato ideal in the sense of Budur (i.e. $f^{\prime}
= 1)$ for any factorization of a free and reduced $f$ and for certain factorizations of a non-reduced
$f$. We also compute the roots of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial for any power of a free and reduced
arrangement. If $f$ is tame, we give a combinatorial formula for the roots lying in $[-1,0).$ For
$f^{\prime} \neq 1$ and any factorization of a line arrangement, we compute the zero locus of this
ideal. For free and reduced arrangements of larger rank, we compute the zero locus provided $\text{deg}(f^{\prime})
\leq 4$ and give good estimates otherwise. Along the way we generalize a duality formula for $\mathscr{D}_{X,\mathfrak{x}}[S]f^{\prime}f_{1}^{s_{1}}
\cdots f_{r}^{s_{r}}$ that was first proved by Narv\'aez-Macarro for $f$ reduced, $f^{\prime}
= 1$, and $r = 1.$ As an application, we investigate the minimum number of hyperplanes one must add
to a tame $f$ so that the resulting arrangement is free. This notion of freeing a divisor has been explicitly
studied by Mond and Schulze, albeit not for hyperplane arrangements. We show that small roots of
the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of $f$ can force lower bounds for this number.
