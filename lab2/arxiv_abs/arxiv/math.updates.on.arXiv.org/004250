Quantum thermodynamics can be cast as a resource theory by considering free access to a heat bath,
thereby viewing the Gibbs thermal state at a fixed temperature as a free state and hence any other
state as a resource. Here, we consider a multipartite scenario where several players attempt at
extracting work locally, each having access to a local heat bath (possibly with a different temperature),
assisted with an energy-preserving global unitary. As a specific model, we analyze a collection
of harmonic oscillators or a multimode bosonic system. Focusing on the Gaussian paradigm, we construct
a reasonable resource theory where we identify as free any state that is obtained from a product of
thermal states (possibly at different temperatures) acted upon by any linear-optics passive Gaussian
transformation. We show that the local Gaussian extractable work (if each player applies a Gaussian
unitary, assisted with linear optics) is zero if and only if the covariance matrix of the system is
that of a free state. Associating the set of free states with a set of free operations, identified
as linear-optics transformations (supplemented with tensoring and partial tracing), we build
a theory that is deemed to describe what we coin the local activity of a multimode bosonic system as
a resource. Specifically, a free operation cannot create local activity when acting upon a free
state. We define local activity monotones and provide a closed-form formula for the relative entropy
of local activity for arbitrary two-mode Gaussian states. Furthermore, we prove that the local
Gaussian extractable work defined as the difference between the trace and symplectic trace of the
covariance matrix of the system, is a resource monotone that cannot increase under free operations.
We also provide examples illustrating the distillation of local activity and local Gaussian extractable
work.
