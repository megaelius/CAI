Wave--current interaction (WCI) dynamics energizes and mixes the ocean thermocline by producing
a combination of Langmuir circulation, internal waves and turbulent shear flows, which interact
over a wide range of time scales. Two complementary approaches exist for approximating different
aspects of WCI dynamics. These are the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) approach and the Gent--McWilliams
(GM) approach. Their complementarity is evident in their Kelvin circulation theorems. GLM introduces
a wave pseudomomentum per unit mass into its Kelvin circulation integrand, while GM introduces
a an additional `bolus velocity' to transport its Kelvin circulation loop. The GLM approach models
Eulerian momentum, while the GM approach models Lagrangian transport. In principle, both GLM and
GM are based on the Euler--Boussinesq (EB) equations for an incompressible, stratified, rotating
flow. The differences in their Kelvin theorems arise from differences in how they model the flow
map in the Lagrangian for the Hamilton variational principle underlying the EB equations. A recently
developed approach for uncertainty quantification in fluid dynamics constrains fluid variational
principles to require that Lagrangian trajectories undergo Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport
(SALT). Here we introduce stochastic closure strategies for quantifying uncertainty in WCI by
adapting the SALT approach to both the GLM and GM approximations of the EB variational principle.
In the GLM framework, we introduce a stochastic group velocity for transport of wave properties,
relative to the frame of motion of the Lagrangian mean flow velocity and a stochastic pressure contribution
from the fluctuating kinetic energy. In the GM framework we introduce a stochastic bolus velocity
in addition to the mean drift velocity by imposing the SALT constraint in the GM variational principle.
