We consider algebraic varieties canonically associated to any Lie superalgebra, and study them
in detail for super-Poincar\'e algebras of physical interest. They are the locus of nilpotent elements
in (the projectivized parity reversal of) the odd part of the algebra. Most of these varieties have
appeared in various guises in previous literature, but we study them systematically here, from
a new perspective: as the natural moduli spaces parameterizing twists of a super-Poincar\'e-invariant
physical theory. We obtain a classification of all possible twists, as well as a systematic analysis
of unbroken symmetry in twisted theories. The natural stratification of the varieties, the identification
of strata with twists, and the action of Lorentz and $R$-symmetry on the varieties are emphasized.
We also include a short and unconventional exposition of the pure-spinor superfield formalism,
from the perspective of twisting, and demonstrate that it can be applied to construct familiar multiplets
in four-dimensional minimally supersymmetric theories; in all dimensions and with any amount
of supersymmetry, this technique produces BRST or BV complexes of supersymmetric theories from
the Koszul complex of the cone point over the coordinate ring of the nilpotence variety, possibly
tensored with a module over that coordinate ring. In addition, we remark on a natural emergence of
nilpotence varieties in the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of supertranslations, and give two
applications related to these ideas: a calculation of Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology for the
six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ supertranslation algebra, and a BV complex matching the
field content of type IIB supergravity from the coordinate ring of the corresponding nilpotence
variety.
