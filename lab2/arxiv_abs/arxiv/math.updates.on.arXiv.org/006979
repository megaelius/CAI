Since its introduction in 1952, Turing's (pre-)pattern theory ("the chemical basis of morphogenesis")
has been widely applied to a number of areas in developmental biology. The related pattern formation
models normally comprise a system of reaction-diffusion equations for interacting chemical species
("morphogens"), whose heterogeneous distribution in some spatial domain acts as a template for
cells to form some kind of pattern or structure through, for example, differentiation or proliferation
induced by the chemical pre-pattern. Here we develop a hybrid discrete-continuum modelling framework
for the formation of cellular patterns via the Turing mechanism. In this framework, a stochastic
individual-based model of cell movement and proliferation is combined with a reaction-diffusion
system for the concentrations of some morphogens. As an illustrative example, we focus on a model
in which the dynamics of the morphogens are governed by an activator-inhibitor system that gives
rise to Turing pre-patterns. The cells then interact with morphogens in their local area through
either of two forms of chemically-dependent cell action: chemotaxis and chemically-controlled
proliferation. We begin by considering such a hybrid model posed on static spatial domains, and
then turn to the case of growing domains. In both cases, we formally derive the corresponding deterministic
continuum limit and show that that there is an excellent quantitative match between the spatial
patterns produced by the stochastic individual-based model and its deterministic continuum counterpart,
when sufficiently large numbers of cells are considered. This paper is intended to present a proof
of concept for the ideas underlying the modelling framework, with the aim to then apply the related
methods to the study of specific patterning and morphogenetic processes in the future.
