We consider sequences of $U$-processes based on symmetric kernels of a fixed order, that possibly
depend on the sample size. Our main contribution is the derivation of a set of analytic sufficient
conditions, under which the aforementioned $U$-processes weakly converge to a linear combination
of time-changed independent Brownian motions. In view of the underlying symmetric structure,
the involved time-changes and weights remarkably depend only on the order of the U-statistic, and
have consequently a universal nature. Checking these sufficient conditions requires calculations
that have roughly the same complexity as those involved in the computation of fourth moments and
cumulants. As such, when applied to the degenerate case, our findings are infinite-dimensional
extensions of the central limit theorems (CLTs) proved in de Jong (1990) and D\"obler and Peccati
(2017). As important tools in our analysis, we exploit the multidimensional central limit theorems
established in D\"obler and Peccati (2019) together with upper bounds on absolute moments of degenerate
$U$-statistics by Ibragimov and Sharakhmetov (2002), and also prove some novel multiplication
formulae for degenerate symmetric $U$-statistics --- allowing for different sample sizes ---
that are of independent interest. We provide applications to random geometric graphs and to a class
of $U$-statistics of order two, whose Gaussian fluctuations have been recently studied by Robins
et al. (2016), in connection with quadratic estimators in non-parametric models. In particular,
our application to random graphs yields a class of new functional central limit theorems for subgraph
counting statistics, extending previous findings in the literature. Finally, some connections
with invariance principles in changepoint analysis are established.
