The electric energy storage units characterization currently utilized for power system operation
and planning models relies on two major assumptions: the charge and discharge efficiencies are
constant, and the maximum charge and discharge powers are independent of the electric energy storage
state of charge. This approach can lead to a misestimation of the storage available power and energy.
A detailed model for optimally manage Li-ion batteries is developed describing their electrochemical
behavior. The model provides a characterization of the battery performance including, non-linear
charging and discharging efficiencies, as well as power limits for its charge and discharge as a
function of the state of charge and requested power. Then, we derive a linear reformulation of the
optimization problem without the introduction of binary variables, allowing a computationally
efficient model despite the higher accuracy. The proposed battery characterization provides
a more accurate characterization of the Li-ion battery system performance and technical operational
limits with regard to the classical ideal models. The proposed battery model has been compared with
an ideal battery model typically used in power system community. It has been tested on the 24-bus
system for the network-constrained economic dispatch problem. %Reliability of the proposed formulation
is quantified by comparison of the scheduled battery operation and the mismatch in the realization
of the schedule, a consequence of the non-constant power limits and efficiency. For the performed
simulations, we obtained about 12\% of energy mismatch between the schedule when using an ideal
battery model and the proposed detailed model in here.
