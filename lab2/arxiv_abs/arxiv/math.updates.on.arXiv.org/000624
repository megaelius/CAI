In this paper we employ three recent analytical approaches to investigate the possible classes
of traveling wave solutions of some members of a family of so-called short-pulse equations (SPE).
A recent, novel application of phase-plane analysis is first employed to show the existence of breaking
kink wave solutions in certain parameter regimes. Secondly, smooth traveling waves are derived
using a recent technique to derive convergent multi-infinite series solutions for the homoclinic
(heteroclinic) orbits of the traveling-wave equations for the SPE equation, as well as for its generalized
version with arbitrary coefficients. These correspond to pulse (kink or shock) solutions respectively
of the original PDEs. Unlike the majority of unaccelerated convergent series, high accuracy is
attained with relatively few terms. And finally, variational methods are employed to generate
families of both regular and embedded solitary wave solutions for the SPE PDE. The technique for
obtaining the embedded solitons incorporates several recent generalizations of the usual variational
technique and it is thus topical in itself. One unusual feature of the solitary waves derived here
is that we are able to obtain them in analytical form (within the assumed ansatz for the trial functions).
Thus, a direct error analysis is performed, showing the accuracy of the resulting solitary waves.
Given the importance of solitary wave solutions in wave dynamics and information propagation in
nonlinear PDEs, as well as the fact that not much is known about solutions of the family of generalized
SPE equations considered here, the results obtained are both new and timely.
