The vanishing of reduced $\ell^2$-cohomology for amenable groups can be traced to the work of Cheeger
& Gromov in \cite{CG}. Whether the same thing can be said for other $p \in ]1,\infty[$ still remains
open. In this paper, result for the triviality of $\ssl{\ell^pH}^1(G)$ are obtained, for example:
when $p \in ]1,2]$ and $G$ amenable; when $p \in ]1,\infty[$ and $G$ is Liouville (e.g. of intermediate
growth). This is done by answering a question of Pansu in \cite{Pan-rs}. The natural quotient from
reduced $\ell^q$-cohomology to reduced $\ell^p$-cohomology ($1\leq q<p$) is also shown to
be an inclusion for groups which are not virtually-$\zz$ and for graphs satisfying a $d$-dimensional
isoperimetric profile with $d >2p$. This is used to obtain an alternative proof of the following
statement: if $G$ is a group admitting a presentation with $k$ generators and $\leq k-2$ relations,
and if $N$ is a normal subgroup then either $N$ is finite, $N$ is of finite index, or $N$ is not finitely
generated. The vanishing of reduced $\ell^p$-cohomology is equivalent to the absence of non-constant
$p$-harmonic continuous functions ($p \in ]1,\infty[$). Using the invariance properties, the
above results transfer to Riemannian manifolds of bounded geometry quasi-isometric to the afore-mentioned
graphs and groups. For example, if $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $\pi_1(M)$ is amenable,
then there are no non-constant continuous $p$-harmonic functions on the universal cover $\widetilde{M}$
of $M$ for $p \in ]1,2]$. Also, if $M$ satisfies a $d$-dimensional isoperimetric inequality, $d>
2p$ and $M$ is Liouville then $\ssl{\ell^pH}^1(M) = \{0\}$.
