Let $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$ be the boson Fock space over a finite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.
It is shown that every gaussian symmetry admits a Klauder-Bargmann integral representation in
terms of coherent states. Furthermore, gaussian symmetries, gaussian states and second quantization
contractions, all of these operators belong to an adjoint-closed semigroup $\mathcal{E}_2(\mathcal{H})$
of bounded operators in $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$. This yields, a new parametrization of gaussian
states, which is a very fruitful alternative to the customary parametrization by position-momentum
mean vectors and covariance matrices. This leads to a rich harvest of corollaries: (i) every gaussian
state $\rho$ admits a factorization $\rho = Z_{1}^{\dagger}Z_{1}$, where $Z_{1}$ is an element
of $\mathcal{E}_2(\mathcal{H})$ and has the form $Z_{1} = \sqrt{c}\Gamma(\sqrt{\Lambda})\exp{\sum_{r=1}^{n}
\lambda_ra_r+\sum_{r,s=1}^{n} \alpha_{rs}a_{r}a_{s}}$ on the dense linear manifold generated
by all exponential vectors, $\Lambda$ being a positive operator in $\mathcal{H}$, $a_{r}, 1\leq
r \leq n$ are the annihilation operators corresponding to the $n$ different modes in $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$,
$\lambda_r\in \mathbb{C}$ and $[\alpha_{rs}]$ is a symmetric matrix in $M_n(\mathbb{C})$; (ii)
an explicit formula for the matrix entries of a general gaussian state on the $n$-mode finite particle
basis of $\Gamma(\mathcal{H})$, which throws light on the architecture of a gaussian state; (iii)
Tomography of a gaussian state by a finite number of two valued measurements which is $O(n^2)$; (iv)
a hierarchy of completely entangled pure gaussian states invariant under the action of the permutation
group $S_n$ on the set of all the $n$ modes; (v) a test for entanglement of bipartite gaussian states,
different from criteria based on partial traces in the covariance matrix.
