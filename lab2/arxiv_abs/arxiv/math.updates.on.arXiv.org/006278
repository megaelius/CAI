The unprecedented increase in the demand for mobile data, fuelled by new emerging applications
such as HD video streaming and heightened online activities has caused massive strain on the existing
cellular networks. As a solution, the 5G technology has been introduced to improve network performance
through various innovative features such as mmWave spectrum and HetNets. In essence, HetNets include
several small cells underlaid within macro-cell to serve densely populated regions. Recently,
a mobile layer of HetNet has been under consideration by the researchers and is often referred to
as moving networks. Moving networks comprise of mobile cells that are primarily introduced to improve
QoS for commuting users inside public transport because the QoS is deteriorated due to vehicular
penetration losses. Furthermore, the users inside fast moving public transport also exert excessive
load on the core network due to large group handovers. To this end, mobile cells will play a crucial
role in reducing overall handover count and will help in alleviating these problems by decoupling
in-vehicle users from the core network. To date, remarkable research results have been achieved
by the research community in addressing challenges linked to moving networks. However, to the best
of our knowledge, a discussion on moving networks in a holistic way is missing in the current literature.
To fill the gap, in this paper, we comprehensively survey moving networks. We cover the technological
aspects and their applications in the futuristic applications. We also discuss the use-cases and
value additions that moving networks may bring to future cellular architecture and identify the
challenges associated with them. Based on the identified challenges we discuss the future research
directions.
