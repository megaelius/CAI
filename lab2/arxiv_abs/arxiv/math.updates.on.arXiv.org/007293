Let $G$ be a connected graph and $u,v$ and $w$ vertices of $G$. Then $w$ is said to {\em strongly resolve}
$u$ and $v$, if there is either a shortest $u$-$w$ path that contains $v$ or a shortest $v$-$w$ path
that contains $u$. A set $W$ of vertices of $G$ is a {\em strong resolving set} if every pair of vertices
of $G$ is strongly resolved by some vertex of $W$. A smallest strong resolving set of a graph is called
a {\em strong basis} and its cardinality, denoted $\beta_s(G)$, the {\em strong dimension} of $G$.
The {\em threshold strong dimension} of a graph $G$, denoted $\tau_s(G)$, is the smallest strong
dimension among all graphs having $G$ as spanning subgraph. A graph whose strong dimension equals
its threshold strong dimension is called $\beta_s$-{\em irreducible}. In this paper we establish
a geometric characterization for the threshold strong dimension of a graph $G$ that is expressed
in terms of the smallest number of paths (each of sufficiently large order) whose strong product
admits a certain type of embedding of $G$. We demonstrate that the threshold strong dimension of
a graph is not equal to the previously studied threshold dimension of a graph. Graphs with strong
dimension $1$ and $2$ are necessarily $\beta_s$-irreducible. It is well-known that the only graphs
with strong dimension $1$ are the paths. We completely describe graphs with strong dimension $2$
in terms of the strong resolving graphs introduced by Oellermann and Peters-Fransen. We obtain
sharp upper bounds for the threshold strong dimension of general graphs and determine exact values
for this invariant for certain subclasses of trees.
