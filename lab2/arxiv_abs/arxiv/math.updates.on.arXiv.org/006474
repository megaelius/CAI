In this review article we collected more than ten theorems on expansions of iterated Ito and Stratonovich
stochastic integrals, which have been formulated and proved by the author. These theorems open
a new direction for study of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The expansions
based on multiple and iterated Fourier--Legendre series as well as on multiple and iterated trigonomectic
Fourier series converging in the mean and pointwise are presented in the article. Some of these theorems
connected with the iterated stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 5. Also we consider two
theorems on expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ based
on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ as well as two theorems
on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ based
on generalized iterated Fourier series converging pointwise. On the base of the presented theorems
we formulate 3 hypotheses on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary
multiplicity $k$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in $L_2([t, T]^k).$
Also we give the proof of two out of three mentioned hypotheses for the case of multiple trigonometric
Fourier series. The mentioned iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals are part of the Taylor-Stratonovich
expansions. Moreover, the considered expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals
contain only one operation of the limit transition and substantially simpler than their analogues
for iterated Ito stochastic integrals. Therefore the results of the article can be useful for solution
of the problem of numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.
