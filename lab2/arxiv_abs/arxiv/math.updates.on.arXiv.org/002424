Numerical schemes provably preserving the positivity of density and pressure are highly desirable
for MHD, but the rigorous positivity-preserving (PP) analysis remains challenging. The difficulties
mainly arise from the intrinsic complexity of the MHD equations as well as the indeterminate relation
between the PP property and the divergence-free condition on magnetic field. We present the first
rigorous PP analysis of conservative schemes with Lax-Friedrichs (LF) flux for ideal MHD. The significant
innovation is the discovery of theoretical connection between PP property and a discrete divergence-free
(DDF) condition. This connection is established through the generalized LF splitting properties,
which are alternatives of the usually-expected LF splitting property that does not hold for ideal
MHD. The generalized LF splitting properties involve a number of admissible states strongly coupled
by DDF condition, making their derivation very difficult. We derive these properties via a novel
equivalent form of the admissible state set and an important inequality skillfully constructed
by technical estimates. Rigorous PP analysis is presented for finite volume and discontinuous
Galerkin schemes with LF flux on uniform Cartesian meshes. In 1D case, PP property is proved for the
first-order scheme with proper numerical viscosity, and also for arbitrarily high-order schemes
under conditions accessible by a PP limiter. In 2D case, we show that the DDF condition is necessary
and crucial for achieving PP property. It is observed that even slightly violating the proposed
DDF condition may cause failure to preserve the positivity of pressure. We prove that the 2D LF type
scheme with proper numerical viscosity preserves the positivity and DDF condition. Sufficient
conditions are derived for 2D PP high-order schemes, and extension to 3D is discussed. Numerical
examples confirm the theoretical findings.
