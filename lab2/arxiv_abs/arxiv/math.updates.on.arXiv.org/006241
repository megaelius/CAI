During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also challenging problems is to forecast
the future trends, on which all follow-up actions of individuals and governments heavily rely.
However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation
of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 pandemics
now. Based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring
of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical
functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models. We highlight the significance
of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well
as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root
mean square error and robustness index to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive
simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in forecasting. We further notice
the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function
makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time dependent
reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number into consideration,
we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior
of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection
point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the ODE models, the SEIR-QD
and SEIR-PO models are shown to be suitable for modeling the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could
be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine.
