There has been a growing interest in the commercialization of millimeter wave (mmW) technology
as a part of the Fifth-Generation New Radio (5G-NR) wireless standardization efforts. In this direction,
many sets of independent measurement campaigns show that wireless propagation at mmW carrier frequencies
is only marginally worse than propagation at sub-6 GHz carrier frequencies for small-cell coverage
--- one of the most important use-cases for 5G-NR. On the other hand, the biggest determinants of
viability of mmW systems in practice are penetration and blockage of mmW signals through different
materials in the scattering environment. With this background, the focus of this paper is on understanding
the impact of blockage of mmW signals and reduced spatial coverage due to penetration through the
human hand, body, vehicles, etc. Leveraging measurements with a 28 GHz mmW experimental prototype
and electromagnetic simulation studies, we first propose statistical blockage models to capture
the impact of the hand, human body and vehicles. We then study the time-scales at which mmW signals
are disrupted by blockage (hand and human body). Our results show that these events can be attributed
to physical movements and the time-scales corresponding to blockage are hence on the order of a few
100 ms or more. Building on this fundamental understanding, we finally consider the broader question
of robustness of mmW beamforming to handle blockage. Network densification, subarray switching
in a user equipment (UE) designed with multiple subarrays, fall back mechanisms such as codebook
enhancements and switching to legacy carriers in non-standalone deployments, etc. can address
blockage before it leads to a deleterious impact on the mmW link margin.
