In this paper, we develop a simple and fast online algorithm for solving a class of binary integer
linear programs (LPs) arisen in general resource allocation problem. The algorithm requires only
one single pass through the input data and is free of doing any matrix inversion. It can be viewed as
both an approximate algorithm for solving binary integer LPs and a fast algorithm for solving online
LP problems. The algorithm is inspired by an equivalent form of the dual problem of the relaxed LP
and it essentially performs (one-pass) projected stochastic subgradient descent in the dual space.
We analyze the algorithm in two different models, stochastic input and random permutation, with
minimal technical assumptions on the input data. The algorithm achieves $O\left(m \sqrt{n}\right)$
expected regret under the stochastic input model and $O\left((m+\log n)\sqrt{n}\right)$ expected
regret under the random permutation model, and it achieves $O(m \sqrt{n})$ expected constraint
violation under both models, where $n$ is the number of decision variables and $m$ is the number of
constraints. The algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee when generalized to a multi-dimensional
LP setting which covers a wider range of applications. In addition, we employ the notion of permutational
Rademacher complexity and derive regret bounds for two earlier online LP algorithms for comparison.
Both algorithms improve the regret bound with a factor of $\sqrt{m}$ by paying more computational
cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to convert the possibly infeasible solution to a feasible
one through a randomized procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate the general applicability
and effectiveness of the algorithms.
