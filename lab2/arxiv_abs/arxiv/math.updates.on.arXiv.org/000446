A graph $G$ covers a graph $H$ if there exists a locally bijective homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. We
deal with regular covers in which this locally bijective homomorphism is prescribed by an action
of a subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(G)$. Regular covers have many applications in constructions and studies
of big objects all over mathematics and computer science. We study computational aspects of regular
covers that have not been addressed before. The decision problem RegularCover asks for two given
graphs $G$ and $H$ whether $G$ regularly covers $H$. When $|H|=1$, this problem becomes Cayley graph
recognition for which the complexity is still unresolved. Another special case arises for $|G|
= |H|$ when it becomes the graph isomorphism problem. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to graph
classes with polynomially solvable graph isomorphism. Inspired by Negami, we apply the structural
results used by Babai in the 1970's to study automorphism groups of graphs. Our main result is the
following FPT meta-algorithm: Let $\cal C$ be a class of graphs such that the structure of automorphism
groups of 3-connected graphs in $\cal C$ is simple. Then we can solve RegularCover for $\cal C$-inputs
$G$ in time $O^*(2^{e(H)/2})$ where $e(H)$ denotes the number of the edges of $H$. As one example
of $\cal C$, this meta-algorithm applies to planar graphs. In comparison, testing general graph
covers is known to be NP-complete for planar inputs $G$ even for small fixed graphs $H$ such as $K_4$
or $K_5$. Most of our results also apply to general graphs, in particular the complete structural
understanding of regular covers for 2-cuts.
