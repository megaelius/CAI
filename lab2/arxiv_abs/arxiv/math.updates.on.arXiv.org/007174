Given any Euclidean ordered field, $Q$, and any 'reasonable' group, $G$, of (1+3)-dimensional
spacetime symmetries, we show how to construct a model $M_{G}$ of kinematics for which the set $W$
of worldview transformations between inertial observers satisfies $W=G$. This holds in particular
for all relevant subgroups of $Gal$, $cPoi$, and $cEucl$ (the groups of Galilean, Poincar\'e and
Euclidean transformations, respectively, where $c\in Q$ is a model-specific parameter orresponding
to the speed of light in the case of Poincar\'e transformations). In doing so, by an elementary geometrical
proof, we demonstrate our main contribution: spatial isotropy is enough to entail that the set $W$
of worldview transformations satisfies either $W\subseteq Gal$, $W\subseteq cPoi$, or $W\subseteq
cEucl$ for some $c>0$. So assuming spatial isotropy is enough to prove that there are only 3 possible
cases: either the world is classical (the worldview transformations between inertial observers
are Galilean transformations); the world is relativistic (the worldview transformations are
Poincar\'e transformations); or the world is Euclidean (which gives a nonstandard kinematical
interpretation to Euclidean geometry). This result considerably extends previous results in
this field, which assume a priori the (strictly stronger) special principle of relativity, while
also restricting the choice of $Q$ to the field of reals. As part of this work, we also prove the rather
surprising result that, for any $G$ containing translations and rotations fixing the time-axis
$t$, the requirement that $G$ be a subgroup of one of the groups $Gal$, $cPoi$ or $cEucl$ is logically
equivalent to the somewhat simpler requirement that, for all $g\in G$: $g[t]$ is a line, and if $g[t]=t$
then $g$ is a trivial transformation (i.e. $g$ is a linear transformation that preserves Euclidean
length and fixes the time-axis setwise).
