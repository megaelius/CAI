In this paper we present a systematic, data-driven approach to discovering "bespoke" coarse variables
based on manifold learning algorithms. We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto
phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully
identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We
then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution
equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated
on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate
approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow data, and hence discover
useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate
this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto
order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to
learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology.
In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical finite
differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational
examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover
sets of "effective" parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models
with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including
the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained
neuronal network behavior.
