The interest for uniformly distributed (u.d.) sequences of points, in particular for sequences
with small discrepancy, arises from various applications. For instance, low-discrepancy sequences,
which are sequences with a discrepancy of order $((\log N)^d)/N$ ($d$ is the dimension of the space
where the sequence lies), are a fundamental tool for getting faster rate of convergence in approximation
involving Quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The objectives of this work can be summarized as follows (1)The
research of explicit techniques for introducing new classes of u.d. sequences of points and of partitions
on $[0,1]$ and also on fractal sets (2) A quantitative analysis of the distribution behaviour of
a class of generalized Kakutani's sequences on $[0,1]$ through the study of their discrepancy.
Concerning (1), we propose an algorithm to construct u.d. sequences of partitions and of points
on fractals generated by an Iterated Function System (IFS) of similarities having the same ratio
and satisfying a natural separation condition of their components called Open Set Condition (OSC).
We also provide an estimate for the elementary discrepancy of these sequences. We generalize these
results to a wider class of fractals by using a recent generalization of Kakutani's splitting procedure
on $[0,1]$, namely the technique of $\rho-$refinements. First, we focus on (2) and get precise bounds
for the discrepancy of a large class of generalized Kakutani's sequences, exploiting a correspondence
between the tree representation associated to successive $\rho-$refinements and the tree generated
by Khodak's coding algorithm. Then we adapt the $\rho-$refinements method to the new class of fractals
and prove bounds for the elementary discrepancy of the sequences of partitions constructed with
such a procedure.
