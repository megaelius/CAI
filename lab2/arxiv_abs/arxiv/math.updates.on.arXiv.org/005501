Consider a pair $(X,L)$, of a Weinstein manifold $X$ with an exact Lagrangian submanifold $L$, with
ideal contact boundary $(Y,\Lambda)$, where $Y$ is a contact manifold and $\Lambda\subset Y$ is
a Legendrian submanifold. We introduce the Chekanov-Eliashberg DG-algebra, $CE^{\ast}(\Lambda)$,
with coefficients in chains of the based loop space of $\Lambda$ and study its relation to the Floer
cohomology $CF^{\ast}(L)$ of $L$. Using the augmentation induced by $L$, $CE^{\ast}(\Lambda)$
can be expressed as the Adams cobar construction $\Omega$ applied to a Legendrian coalgebra, $LC_{\ast}(\Lambda)$.
We define a twisting cochain: \[ \mathfrak{t} \colon LC_{\ast}(\Lambda) \to \mathrm{B} (CF^*(L))^\#
\] via holomorphic curve counts, where $\mathrm{B}$ denotes the bar construction and $\#$ the graded
linear dual. We show under simply-connectedness assumptions that the corresponding Koszul complex
is acyclic which then implies that $CE^*(\Lambda)$ and $CF^{\ast}(L)$ are Koszul dual. In particular,
$\mathfrak{t}$ induces a quasi-isomorphism between $CE^*(\Lambda)$ and the cobar of the Floer
homology of $L$, $\Omega CF_*(L)$. We use the duality result to show that under certain connectivity
and locally finiteness assumptions, $CE^*(\Lambda)$ is quasi-isomorphic to $C_{-*}(\Omega
L)$ for any Lagrangian filling $L$ of $\Lambda$. Our constructions have interpretations in terms
of wrapped Floer cohomology after versions of Lagrangian handle attachments. In particular, we
outline a proof that $CE^{\ast}(\Lambda)$ is quasi-isomorphic to the wrapped Floer cohomology
of a fiber disk $C$ in the Weinstein domain obtained by attaching $T^{\ast}(\Lambda\times[0,\infty))$
to $X$ along $\Lambda$ (or, in the terminology of arXiv:1604.02540 the wrapped Floer cohomology
of $C$ in $X$ with wrapping stopped by $\Lambda$). Along the way, we give a definition of wrapped Floer
cohomology via holomorphic buildings.
