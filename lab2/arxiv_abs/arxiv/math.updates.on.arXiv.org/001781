For every natural number $n\ge2$, the Agler-Young class is defined as \begin{align} AY_n &= \{ \underline{S}
= (S_1, S_2, \ldots,S_n) \mbox{ is a tuple of bounded operators such that } \nonumber & S_n \mbox{
is a contraction and } S_1, S_2, \ldots ,S_{n-1} \mbox{ satisfy } S_i - S_{n-i}^*S_n = D_{S_n} X_{i}D_{S_n}\}.
\nonumber \end{align} An element of the Agler-Young class is also called an Agler-Young tuple,
where the length of the tuple $n$ is usually clear from the context. An Agler-Young tuple of which
the last component $S_n$ is an isometry is called an Agler-Young isometry. There are several major
results about Agler-Young tuples in this paper. \begin{enumerate} \item An Agler-Young isometry
has a Wold decomposition into a unitary part and a shift part. Structures of both parts are made explicit.
A natural set of invariants is found. \item An Agler-Young tuple has a dilation to an Agler-Young
isometry. The dilation takes place on the space of minimal isometric dilation of the contraction
$S_n$ and the main ingredient of the dilation is a certain class of Toeplitz operators. The dilation
is minimal and is unique under a natural condition. \item The present study is motivated by known
commutative results which arose in relation to a von Neumann type inequality with respect to a certain
subset of $\mathbb C^2$. It is shown here that such an inequality holds in the non-commutative case
as well. Agler's abstract model theory and hereditary polynomials come into play for this. \item
A commuting Agler-Young tuple does not necessarily have a commuting Agler-Young isometric dilation
(although it always has a non-commuting one). A sufficient condition for the dilation to be commuting
is obtained. We point out connections with the commuting theory and mention them as and when appropriate.
