The fractional Laplacian in R^d has multiple equivalent characterizations. Moreover, in bounded
domains, boundary conditions must be incorporated in these characterizations in mathematically
distinct ways, and there is currently no consensus in the literature as to which definition of the
fractional Laplacian in bounded domains is most appropriate for a given application. The Riesz
(or integral) definition, for example, admits a nonlocal boundary condition, where the value of
a function u(x) must be prescribed on the entire exterior of the domain in order to compute its fractional
Laplacian. In contrast, the spectral definition requires only the standard local boundary condition.
These differences, among others, lead us to ask the question: "What is the fractional Laplacian?"
We compare several commonly used definitions of the fractional Laplacian (the Riesz, spectral,
directional, and horizon-based nonlocal definitions), and we use a quantitative approach to identify
their practical differences. In this work, we provide a quantitative assessment of new numerical
methods as well as available state-of-the-art methods for discretizing the fractional Laplacian,
and we present new results on the differences in features, regularity, and boundary behaviors of
solutions to equations posed with these different definitions. We present stochastic interpretations
and demonstrate the equivalence between some recent formulations. Through our efforts, we aim
to further engage the research community in open problems and assist practitioners in identifying
the most appropriate definition and computational approach to use for their mathematical models
in addressing anomalous transport in diverse applications.
