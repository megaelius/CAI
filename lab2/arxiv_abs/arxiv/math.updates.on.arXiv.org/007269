The problem of computing spectra of operators is arguably one of the most investigated areas of computational
mathematics. Recent progress and the current paper reveal that, unlike the finite-dimensional
case, infinite-dimensional problems yield a highly intricate infinite classification theory
determining which spectral problems can be solved and with which type of algorithms. Classifying
spectral problems and providing optimal algorithms is uncharted territory in the foundations
of computational mathematics. This paper is the first of a two-part series establishing the foundations
of computational spectral theory through the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy and
has three purposes. First, we establish answers to many longstanding open questions on the existence
of algorithms. We show that for large classes of partial differential operators on unbounded domains,
spectra can be computed with error control from point sampling operator coefficients. Further
results include computing spectra of operators on graphs with error control, the spectral gap problem,
spectral classifications, and discrete spectra, multiplicities and eigenspaces. Second, these
classifications determine which types of problems can be used in computer-assisted proofs. The
theory for this is virtually non-existent, and we provide some of the first results in this infinite
classification theory. Third, our proofs are constructive, yielding a library of new algorithms
and techniques that handle problems that before were out of reach. We show several examples on contemporary
problems in the physical sciences. Our approach is closely related to Smale's program on the foundations
of computational mathematics initiated in the 1980s, as many spectral problems can only be computed
via several limits, a phenomenon shared with the foundations of polynomial root finding with rational
maps, as proved by McMullen.
