This paper revisits the problem of characterizing the highest spatial throughput -- or spatial
capacity -- of wireless networks in [bits/s/Hz/square meter] in light of some recent results. We
analyze the expected maximum achievable sum rates over a given area based on the capacity regions
of Gaussian point-to-point codes in Poisson distributed wireless networks under two decoding
rules, namely (i) IAN: treating interference as noise, and (ii) OPT: jointly detecting the strongest
interfering signals, treating the others as noise. We prove that the average spatial capacity is
the product of the network density and the expected value of the achievable coding rates that maximize
the spatial throughput for different network realizations. Assuming that the closest interferer
power approximates the aggregate interference caused by all transmitters that are treated as noise,
we analytically derive several properties of the average spatial capacity and evince the better
performance of OPT decoders. We also compare these results to the ones obtained for a scenario where
transmitters code their messages at predetermined fixed rates that are tuned to optimize the average
spatial throughput, regardless of particular realizations of the network. Using this approach,
however, some rates may not be achievable, yielding outage events. We analytically show that, when
the same decoding rule and network density are considered, the spatial-capacity-achieving scheme
always outperforms the spatial throughput obtained with the best predetermined fixed rate strategy.
We then discuss the validity of our approximation using simulation results and implementation
issues related to different mobility patterns.
