The chosen tool of this thesis is an extremal type approach. The lesson drawn by the theorems proved
in the thesis is that surprisingly small compromise is necessary on the efficacy of the solutions
to make the approach work. The problems studied have several connections to other subjects and practical
applications. The first part of the thesis is concerned with orthogonal art galleries. A sharp extremal
bound is proved on partitioning orthogonal polygons into at most 8-vertex polygons using established
techniques in the field of art gallery problems. This fills in the gap between already known results
for partitioning into at most 6- and 10-vertex orthogonal polygons. Next, these techniques are
further developed to prove a new type of extremal art gallery result. The novelty provided by this
approach is that it establishes a connection between mobile and stationary guards. This theorem
has strong computational consequences, in fact, it provides the basis for an $\frac83$-approximation
algorithm for guarding orthogonal polygons with rectangular vision. In the second part, the graph
theoretical concept of terminal-pairability is studied in complete and complete grid graphs.
Once again, the extremal approach is conductive to discovering efficient methods to solve the problem.
In the case of a complete base graph, the new demonstrated lower bound on the maximum degree of realizable
demand graphs is 4 times higher than previous best results. The techniques developed are then used
to solve the classical extremal edge number problem for the terminal-pairability problem in complete
base graphs. The complete grid base graph lies on the other end of the spectrum in terms density amongst
path-pairable graphs. It is shown that complete grid graphs are relatively efficient in routing
edge-disjoint paths.
