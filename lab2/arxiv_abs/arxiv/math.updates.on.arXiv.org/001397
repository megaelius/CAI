We consider the Freeway Network Control problem, that is, we aim to optimize the operation of traffic
networks modeled by the Cell Transmission Model via ramp metering and partial mainline demand control.
Optimal control problems for the Cell Transmission Model are usually nonconvex due to the nonlinear
fundamental diagram, but a convex relaxation in which demand and supply constraints are relaxed
is often used. Previous works have established conditions which ensure that solutions of the relaxation
can be made feasible with respect to the original constraints, in particular by using mainline demand
control. In addition, conditions on the network structure and the flow dynamics have been derived
which ensure that ramp metering alone is sufficient to make solutions to the relaxation feasible.
In this work, we generalize these conditions and show that control of flows into the merge vertices
in a traffic network is sufficient to make solutions to the relaxation feasible if the objective
is to minimize the Total Time Spent. We derive the main result by introducing an alternative system
representation, obtained via a state transformation. The system dynamics are concave and state-monotone
in the new representation and we show that exactness of the convex relaxation of finite horizon optimal
control problems follows from these properties. Deriving the main result via a characterization
of the system dynamics allows to treat arbitrary monotone, concave fundamental diagrams and several
types of controlled merges in a uniform manner. It also suggests a straightforward method to verify
if the results continue to hold for extensions or modifications of the models studied in this work.
