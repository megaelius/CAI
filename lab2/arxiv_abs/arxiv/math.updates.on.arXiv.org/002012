This paper addresses the four enabling technologies, namely multi-user sparse code multiple access
(SCMA), content caching, energy harvesting, and physical layer security for proposing an energy
and spectral efficient resource allocation algorithm for the access and backhaul links in heterogeneous
cellular networks. Although each of the above mentioned issues could be a topic of research, in a
real situation, we would face a complicated scenario where they should be considered jointly, and
hence, our target is to consider these technologies jointly in a unified framework. Moreover, we
propose two novel content delivery scenarios: 1) single frame content delivery, and 2) multiple
frames content delivery. In the first scenario, the requested content by each user is served over
one frame. However, in the second scenario, the requested content by each user can be delivered over
several frames. We formulate the resource allocation for the proposed scenarios as optimization
problems where our main aim is to maximize the energy efficiency of access links subject to the transmit
power constraints of access and backhaul links, caching and energy harvesting constraints, and
SCMA codebook allocation limitations. Due to the practical limitations, we assume that the channel
state information values between eavesdroppers and base stations are uncertain and design the
network for the worst case scenario. Since the corresponding optimization problems are mixed integer
non-linear and nonconvex programming, NP-hard, and intractable, we propose an iterative algorithm
based on the well-known alternative and successive convex approximation methods. In addition,
the proposed algorithms are studied from the computational complexity, convergence, and performance
perspectives.
