Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field with $q$ elements and let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$
of dimension $n>0$. Let $\Omega_V$ be the Drinfeld period domain over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This is an
affine scheme of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$, and its base change to $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ is the
moduli space of Drinfeld $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$-modules with level $(t)$ structure and rank $n$. In
this thesis, we give a new modular interpretation to Pink and Schieder's smooth compactification
$B_V$ of $\Omega_V$. Let $\hat V$ be the set $V\cup\{\infty\}$ for a new symbol $\infty$. We define
the notion of a $V$-fern over an $\mathbb{F}_q$-scheme $S$, which consists of a stable $\hat V$-marked
curve of genus $0$ over $S$ endowed with a certain action of the finite group $V\rtimes \mathbb{F}_q^\times$.
Our main result is that the scheme $B_V$ represents the functor that associates an $\mathbb{F}_q$-scheme
$S$ to the set of isomorphism classes of $V$-ferns over $S$. Thus $V$-ferns over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$-schemes
can be regarded as generalizations of Drinfeld $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$-modules with level $(t)$ structure
and rank $n$. To prove this theorem, we construct an explicit universal $V$-fern over $B_V$. We then
show that any $V$-fern over a scheme $S$ determines a unique morphism $S\to B_V$, depending only
its isomorphism class, and that the $V$-fern is isomorphic to the pullback of the universal $V$-fern
along this morphism. We also give several functorial constructions involving $V$-ferns, some
of which are used to prove the main result. These constructions correspond to morphisms between
various modular compactifications of Drinfeld period domains over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We describe
these morphisms explicitly.
