In [2] Su Gao proves that the following are equivalent for a countable $M$ (cf. theorem 1.2 too): (I)There
is an uncountable model of the Scott sentence of $M$. (II) There exists some $j\in \overline{Aut(M)}\setminus
Aut(M)$, where $\overline{Aut(M)}$ is the closure of $Aut(M)$ under the product topology in $\omega^\omega$.
(III) There is an $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$- elementary embedding $j$ from $M$ to itself such that
$range(j)\subset M$. We generalize his theorem to all cardinals $\kappa$ of of cofinality $\omega$
(cf. theorem 4.2). The following are equivalent: (I$^*$) There is a model of the Scott sentence of
$M$ of size $\kappa^+$. (II$^*$) For all $\alpha<\beta<\kappa^+$, there exist functions
$j_{\beta,\alpha}$ in $\overline{Aut(M)}^{T}\setminus Aut(M)$, such that for $\alpha<
\beta<\gamma<\kappa^+$, \begin{equation}(*) j_{\gamma,\beta}\circ j_{\beta,\alpha}=j_{\gamma,\alpha},\end{equation}
where $\overline{Aut(M)}^{T}$ is the closure of $Aut(M)$ under the product topology in $\kappa^\kappa$.
(III$^*$) For every $\beta<\kappa^+$, there exist $L_{\infty,\kappa}^{fin}$- elementary
embeddings (cf. definition 2.5) $(j_\alpha)_{\alpha<\beta}$ from $M$ to itself such that
$\alpha_1<\alpha_2\Rightarrow range(j_{\alpha_1})\subset range(j_{\alpha_2})$. Theorem
4.2 holds both for countable and uncountable $\kappa$. Condition (*) in (II$^*$), which does not
appear in the countable case, can not be removed when $\kappa$ is uncountable (cf. theorem 4.5).
Condition (II$^*$) imply the existence of at least $\kappa^\omega$ automorphisms of $M$ (cf. corollary
4.6). It is unknown to the author whether a purely topological proof of corollary 4.6 exists.
