The biharmonic operator plays a central role in a wide array of physical models, notably in elasticity
theory and the streamfunction formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. The need for corresponding
numerical simulations has led, in recent years, to the development of a discrete biharmonic calculus.
The primary object of this calculus is a high-order compact discrete biharmonic operator (DBO).
The numerical results have been remarkably accurate, and have been corroborated by some rigorous
proofs. However, there remained the "mystery" of the "underlying reason" for this success. This
paper is a contribution in this direction, expounding the strong connection between cubic spline
functions (on an interval) and the DBO. It is shown in particular that the (scaled) fourth-order
distributional derivative of the cubic spline is identical to the action of the DBO on grid functions.
The DBO is constructed in terms of the discrete Hermitian derivative. A remarkable fact is that the
kernel of the inverse of the discrete operator is (up to scaling) equal to the grid evaluation of the
kernel of $\Big[\Big(\frac{d}{dx}\Big)^4\Big]^{-1} .$ Explicit expressions are presented
for both kernels. The relation between the (infinite) set of eigenvalues of the fourth-order Sturm-Liouville
problem and the finite set of eigenvalues of the discrete biharmonic operator is studied, and the
discrete eigenvalues are proved to converge (at an "optimal" $O(h^4)$ rate) to the continuous ones.
Another remarkable consequence is the validity of a comparison principle. It is well known that
there is no maximum principle for the fourth-order equation. However, a positivity result is derived,
both for the continuous and the discrete biharmonic equation, showing that in both cases the kernels
are order preserving.
