Gaussian random fields are popular models for spatially varying uncertainties, arising for instance
in geotechnical engineering, hydrology or image processing. A Gaussian random field is fully characterised
by its mean function and covariance operator. In more complex models these can also be partially
unknown. In this case we need to handle a family of Gaussian random fields indexed with hyperparameters.
Sampling for a fixed configuration of hyperparameters is already very expensive due to the nonlocal
nature of many classical covariance operators. Sampling from multiple configurations increases
the total computational cost severely. In this report we employ parameterised Karhunen-Lo\`eve
expansions for sampling. To reduce the cost we construct a reduced basis surrogate built from snapshots
of Karhunen-Lo\`eve eigenvectors. In particular, we consider Mat\'ern-type covariance operators
with unknown correlation length and standard deviation. We suggest a linearisation of the covariance
function and describe the associated online-offline decomposition. In numerical experiments
we investigate the approximation error of the reduced eigenpairs. As an application we consider
forward uncertainty propagation and Bayesian inversion with an elliptic partial differential
equation where the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient is a parameterised Gaussian random field.
In the Bayesian inverse problem we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo on the reduced space to generate
samples from the posterior measure. All numerical experiments are conducted in 2D physical space,
with non-separable covariance operators, and finite element grids with $\sim 10^4$ degrees of
freedom.
