The derivation of mean-field limits for quantum systems at zero temperature has attracted many
researchers in the last decades. Recent developments are the consideration of pair correlations
in the effective description, which lead to a much more precise description of both spectral properties
and the dynamics of the Bose gas in the weak coupling limit. While mean-field results typically lead
to convergence for the reduced density matrix only, one obtains norm convergence when considering
the pair correlations proposed by Bogoliubov in his seminal 1947 paper. In this article we consider
an interacting Bose gas in the case where both the volume and the density of the gas tend to infinity
simultaneously. We assume that the coupling constant is such that the self-interaction of the fluctuations
is of leading order, which leads to a finite (non-zero) speed of sound in the gas. In our first main
result we show that the difference between the N-body and the Bogoliubov description is small in
$L^2$ as the density of the gas tends to infinity and the volume does not grow too fast. This describes
the dynamics of delocalized excitations of the order of the volume. In our second main result we consider
an interacting Bose gas near the ground state with a macroscopic localized excitation of order of
the density. We prove that the microscopic dynamics of the excitation coming from the N-body Schr\"odinger
equation converges to an effective dynamics which is free evolution with the Bogoliubov dispersion
relation. The main technical novelty are estimates for all moments of the number of particles outside
the condensate for large volume, and in particular control of the tails of their distribution.
