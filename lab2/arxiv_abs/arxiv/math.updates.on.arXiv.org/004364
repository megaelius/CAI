A set $S\subseteq V$ is \textit{independent} in a graph $G=\left( V,E\right) $ if no two vertices
from $S$ are adjacent. The \textit{independence number} $\alpha(G)$ is the cardinality of a maximum
independent set, while $\mu(G)$ is the size of a maximum matching in $G$. If $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)$
equals the order of $G$, then $G$ is called a \textit{K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph }\cite{dem,ster}.
The number $d\left( G\right) =\max\{\left\vert A\right\vert -\left\vert N\left( A\right) \right\vert
:A\subseteq V\}$ is called the \textit{critical difference} of $G$ \cite{Zhang} (where $N\left(
A\right) =\left\{ v:v\in V,N\left( v\right) \cap A\neq\emptyset\right\} $). It is known that
$\alpha(G)-\mu(G)\leq d\left( G\right) $ holds for every graph \cite{Levman2011a,Lorentzen1966,Schrijver2003}.
In \cite{LevMan5} it was shown that $d(G)=\alpha(G)-\mu(G)$ is true for every K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry
graph. A graph $G$ is \textit{(i)} \textit{unicyclic} if it has a unique cycle, \textit{(ii)} \textit{almost
bipartite} if it has only one odd cycle. It was conjectured in \cite{LevMan2012a,LevMan2013a}
and validated in \cite{Bhattacharya2018} that $d(G)=\alpha(G)-\mu(G)$ holds for every unicyclic
non-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph $G$. In this paper we prove that if $G$ is an almost bipartite
graph of order $n\left( G\right) $, then $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)\in\left\{ n\left( G\right) -1,n\left(
G\right) \right\} $. Moreover, for each of these two values, we characterize the corresponding
graphs. Further, using these findings, we show that the critical difference of an almost bipartite
graph $G$ satisfies \[ d(G)=\alpha(G)-\mu(G)=\left\vert \mathrm{core}(G)\right\vert -\left\vert
N(\mathrm{core}(G))\right\vert , \] where by \textrm{core}$\left( G\right) $ we mean the intersection
of all maximum independent sets.
