In this paper I will first outline an effective field theory for cosmology (EFTC) that is based on
the Standard Model coupled to General Relativity and improved with Weyl symmetry. There are no new
physical degrees of freedom in this theory, but what is new is an enlargement of the domain of the existing
physical fields and of spacetime via the larger symmetry, thus curing the geodesic incompleteness
of the traditional theory. Invoking the softer behavior of an underlying theory of quantum gravity,
I further argue that it is reasonable to ban higher curvature terms in the effective action, thus
making this EFTC mathematically well behaved at gravitational singularities, as well as geodesically
complete, thus able to make new physics predictions. Using this EFTC, I show some predictions of
surprising behavior of the universe at singularities including a unique set of big-bang initial
conditions that emerge from a dynamical attractor mechanism. I will illustrate this behavior with
detailed formulas and plots of the classical solutions and the quantum wavefunction that are continuous
across singularities for a cosmology that includes the past and future of the big bang. The solutions
are given in the geodesically complete global mini-superspace that is similar to the extended spacetime
of a black hole or extended Rindler spacetime. The analytic continuation of the quantum wavefunction
across the horizons describes the passage through the singularities. This analytic continuation
solves a long-standing problem of the singular (-1/r^2) potential in quantum mechanics that dates
back to Von Neumann. The analytic properties of the wavefunction also reveal an infinite stack of
universes sewn together at the horizons of the geodesically complete space. Finally a critique
of recent controversial papers using the path integral approach in cosmology is given.
