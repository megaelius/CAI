We address Heath-Brown's and Serre's dimension growth conjecture (proved by Salberger), when
the degree $d$ grows. Recall that Salberger's dimension growth results give bounds of the form $O_{X,
\varepsilon} (B^{\dim X+\varepsilon})$ for the number of rational points of height at most $B$
on any integral subvariety $X$ of ${\mathbb P}^n_{\mathbb Q}$ of degree $d\geq 2$, where one can
write $O_{d,n, \varepsilon}$ instead of $O_{X, \varepsilon}$ as soon as $d\geq 4$. Our main contribution
is to remove the factor $B^\varepsilon$ as soon as $d \geq 5$, without introducing a factor $\log
B$, while moreover obtaining polynomial dependence on $d$ of the implied constant. Working polynomially
in $d$ allows us to give a self-contained and slightly simplified treatment of dimension growth
for degree $d \geq 16$, while in the range $5 \leq d \leq 15$ we invoke results by Browning, Heath-Brown
and Salberger. Along the way we improve the well-known bounds due to Bombieri and Pila on the number
of integral points of bounded height on affine curves and those by Walsh on the number of rational
points of bounded height on projective curves. The former improvement leads to a slight sharpening
of a recent estimate due to Bhargava, Shankar, Taniguchi, Thorne, Tsimerman and Zhao on the size
of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group of a degree $d$ number field. Our treatment builds
on recent work by Salberger which brings in many primes in Heath-Brown's variant of the determinant
method, and on recent work by Walsh and Ellenberg--Venkatesh, who bring in the size of the defining
polynomial. We also obtain lower bounds showing that one cannot do better than polynomial dependence
on $d$.
