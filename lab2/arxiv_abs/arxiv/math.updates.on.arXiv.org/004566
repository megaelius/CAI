Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) are widely used for modeling of dynamical systems. The
difficulty in solving numerically a DAE is measured by its differentiation index. For highly accurate
simulation of dynamical systems, it is important to convert high-index DAEs into low-index DAEs.
Most of existing simulation software packages for dynamical systems are equipped with an index-reduction
algorithm given by Mattsson and S\"{o}derlind. Unfortunately, this algorithm fails if there are
numerical cancellations. These numerical cancellations are often caused by accurate constants
in structural equations. Distinguishing those accurate constants from generic parameters that
represent physical quantities, Murota and Iri introduced the notion of a mixed matrix as a mathematical
tool for faithful model description in structural approach to systems analysis. For DAEs described
with the use of mixed matrices, efficient algorithms to compute the index have been developed by
exploiting matroid theory. This paper presents an index-reduction algorithm for linear DAEs whose
coefficient matrices are mixed matrices, i.e., linear DAEs containing physical quantities as
parameters. Our algorithm detects numerical cancellations between accurate constants, and transforms
a DAE into an equivalent DAE to which Mattsson--S\"{o}derlind's index-reduction algorithm is
applicable. Our algorithm is based on the combinatorial relaxation approach, which is a framework
to solve a linear algebraic problem by iteratively relaxing it into an efficiently solvable combinatorial
optimization problem. The algorithm does not rely on symbolic manipulations but on fast combinatorial
algorithms on graphs and matroids. Furthermore, we provide an improved algorithm under an assumption
based on dimensional analysis of dynamical systems.
