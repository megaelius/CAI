This paper proposes a revised definition for the entanglement cost of a quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$.
In particular, it is defined here to be the smallest rate at which entanglement is required, in addition
to free classical communication, in order to simulate $n$ calls to $\mathcal{N}$, such that the
most general discriminator cannot distinguish the $n$ calls to $\mathcal{N}$ from the simulation.
The most general discriminator is one who tests the channels in a sequential manner, one after the
other, and this discriminator is known as a quantum tester [Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.,
101, 060401 (2008)] or one who is implementing a quantum co-strategy [Gutoski et al., Symp. Th. Comp.,
565 (2007)]. As such, the proposed revised definition of entanglement cost of a quantum channel
leads to a rate that cannot be smaller than the previous notion of a channel's entanglement cost [Berta
et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 59, 6779 (2013)], in which the discriminator is limited to distinguishing
parallel uses of the channel from the simulation. Under this revised notion, I prove that the entanglement
cost of certain teleportation-simulable channels is equal to the entanglement cost of their underlying
resource states. Then I find single-letter formulas for the entanglement cost of some fundamental
channel models, including dephasing, erasure, three-dimensional Werner--Holevo channels,
epolarizing channels (complements of depolarizing channels), as well as single-mode pure-loss
and pure-amplifier bosonic Gaussian channels. These examples demonstrate that the resource theory
of entanglement for quantum channels is not reversible. Finally, I discuss how to generalize the
basic notions to arbitrary resource theories.
