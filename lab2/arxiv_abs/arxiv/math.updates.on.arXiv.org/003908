In recent years new application areas have emerged in which one aims to capture the geometry of objects
by means of three-dimensional point clouds. Often the obtained data consist of a dense sampling
of the object's surface, containing many redundant 3D points. These unnecessary data samples lead
to high computational effort in subsequent processing steps. Thus, point cloud sparsification
or compression is often applied as a preprocessing step. The two standard methods to compress dense
3D point clouds are random subsampling and approximation schemes based on hierarchical tree structures,
e.g., octree representations. However, both approaches give little flexibility for adjusting
point cloud compression based on a-priori knowledge on the geometry of the scanned object. Furthermore,
these methods lead to suboptimal approximations if the 3D point cloud data is prone to noise. In this
paper we propose a variational method defined on finite weighted graphs, which allows to sparsify
a given 3D point cloud while giving the flexibility to control the appearance of the resulting approximation
based on the chosen regularization functional. The main contribution in this paper is a novel coarse-to-fine
optimization scheme for point cloud sparsification, inspired by the efficiency of the recently
proposed Cut Pursuit algorithm for total variation denoising. This strategy gives a substantial
speed up in computing sparse point clouds compared to a direct application on all points as done in
previous works and renders variational methods now applicable for this task. We compare different
settings for our point cloud sparsification method both on unperturbed as well as noisy 3D point
cloud data.
