In the late 1980's Sullivan initiated a programme to prove quasisymmetric rigidity in one-dimensional
dynamics: interval or circle maps that are topologically conjugate are quasisymmetrically conjugate
(provided some obvious necessary assumptions are satisfied). The aim of this paper is to conclude
this programme in a natural class of $C^3$ mappings. Examples of such rigidity were established
previously, but not, for example, for real polynomials with non-real critical points. Our results
are also new for analytic mappings. The main new ingredients of the proof in the real analytic case
are (i) the existence of infinitely many (complex) domains associated to its complex analytic extension
so that these domains and their ranges are compatible, (ii) a methodology for showing that combinatorially
equivalent complex box mappings are qc conjugate, (iii) a methodology for constructing qc conjugacies
in the presence of parabolic periodic points. For a $C^3$ mapping, the dilatation of a high iterate
of any complex extension of the real map will in general be unbounded. To deal with this, we introduce
dynamically defined $qc\backslash bg$ $partitions$, where the appropriate mapping has bounded
quasiconformal dilatation, except on sets with "bounded geometry". To obtain such a partition
we prove that we have very good geometric control for infinitely many dynamically defined domains.
Some of these results are new even for real polynomials, and in fact an important sequence of domains
turn out to be quasidiscs. This technology also gives a new method for dealing with the infinitely
renormalizable case. We will briefly also discuss why quasisymmetric rigidity is such a useful
property in one-dimensional dynamics.
