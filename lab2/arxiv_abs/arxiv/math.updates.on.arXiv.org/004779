In this paper, we present a multiscale method for simulations of the multicontinua unsaturated
flow problems in heterogeneous fractured porous media. The mathematical model is described by
the system of Richards equations for each continuum that coupled by the specific transfer term.
To illustrate the idea of our approach, we consider a dual continua background model with discrete
fractures networks that generalized as a multicontinua model for unsaturated fluid flow in the
complex heterogeneous porous media. We present fine grid approximation based on the finite element
method and Discrete Fracture Model approach. In this model, we construct an unstructured fine grid
that take into account a complex fracture geometries for two and three dimensional formulations.
Due to construction of the unstructured grid, the fine grid approximation leads to the very large
system of equations. For reduction of the discrete system size, we develop a multiscale method for
coarse grid approximation of the coupled problem using Generalized Multiscale Finite Element
Method. In this method, we construct a coupled multiscale basis functions that used to construct
highly accurate coarse grid approximation. The multiscale method allowed us to capture detailed
interactions between multiple continua. We investigate accuracy of the proposed method for the
several test problems in two and three dimensional formulations. We present a comparison of the
relative error for different number of basis functions and for adaptive approach. Numerical results
illustrate that the presented method provide accurate solution of the unsaturated multicontinua
problem on the coarse grid with huge reduction of the discrete system size.
