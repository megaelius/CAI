In this paper we prove the following theorem. Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of a smooth projective
surface over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. If there is no nonconstant invariant
rational function under $f$, then there exists a closed point whose orbit under $f$ is Zariski dense.
This result gives us a positive answer to the Zariski dense orbit conjecture proposed by Medvedev
and Scanlon, by Amerik, Bogomolov and Rovinsky, and by Zhang, for endomorphisms of smooth projective
surfaces. Moreover, we define a new canonical topology on varieties over an algebraically closed
field which has finite transcendence degree over $\mathbb{Q}$. We call it the adelic topology.
The adelic topology is stronger than the Zariski topology and an irreducible variety is still irreducible
in this topology. Using the adelic topology, we propose an adelic verison of the Zariski dense orbit
conjecture. This version is stronger then the original one and it quantifies how many such orbits
there are. We also proved this adelic version for endomorphisms of smooth projective surfaces.
Moreover, we proved the adelic verison of the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms
of abelian varieties and split polynomial maps. This yields new proofs for the original version
in this two cases. In Appendix A, we study the endomorphisms on the $k$-affinoid spaces. We show that
for certain endomorphism $f$ on a $k$-affinoid space $X$, the attractor $Y$ of $f$ is a Zariski closed
subset and the dynamics of $f$ semi-conjugates to its restriction on $Y.$ A special case of this result
is used in the proof of the main theorem. In Appendix B, written in collaboration with Thomas Tucker,
we prove the Zariski dense orbit conjecture for endomorphisms of $(\mathbb{P}^1)^N.$
