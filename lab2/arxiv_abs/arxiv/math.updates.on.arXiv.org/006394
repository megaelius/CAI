Dimer models have been the focus of intense research efforts over the last years. This paper grew
out of an effort to develop new methods to study minimizers or the asymptotic height functions of
general dimer models and the geometry of their frozen boundaries. We prove a complete classification
of the regularity of minimizers and frozen boundaries for all dimer models for a natural class of
polygonal (simply or multiply connected) domains much studied in numerical simulations and elsewhere.
Our classification of the geometries of frozen boundaries can be seen as geometric universality
result for all dimer models. Indeed, we prove a converse result, showing that any geometric situation
for any dimer model is, in the simply connected case, realised already by the lozenge model. To achieve
this we present a new boundary regularity study for a class of Monge-Amp\`ere equations in non-strictly
convex domains, of independent interest, as well as a new approach to minimality for a general dimer
functional. In the context of polygonal domains, we give the first general results for the existence
of gas domains for minimizers. Our results are related to the seminal paper "Limit shapes and the
complex Burgers" equation where R. Kenyon and A. Okounkov studied the asymptotic height function
in the special class of lozenge tilings and domains. Part of the motivation for development of the
new methods in this paper is that it seems difficult to extend those methods to cover more general
dimer models, in particular domino tilings, as we do in the present paper. Indeed, our methods prove
new and sharper results already for the lozenge model.
