The aim of this work is to link the conformal geometry of a Euclidean domain $U$ to the spectral properties
of its energy integral $(D,H^{1,2}(U))$, through the algebra of multipliers $M(H^{1,2}(U))$
of the Sobolev space $H^{1,2}(U)$. The M\"obius group $G(R^n)$ for $n\ge 3$, is shown to act isometrically
on the algebra of multipliers $M(H^{1,2}_e(R^n))$ of the extended Sobolev space $H^{1,2}_e(R^n)$
and the Dirichlet integral $\mathcal{D}$ is proved to be a closable on the space $L^2(R^n,\Gamma[a])$
of the energy measure $\Gamma[a]=|\nabla a|^2\, dx$ of any $a\in M(H^{1,2}_e(R^n))$. We then show
that, for any $\gamma\in G(R^n)$, the form closure $(D,F^a)$ of $(D,H^{1,2}(R^n))$ is a Dirichlet
form on $L^2(R^n,\Gamma[a])$, naturally unitarely equivalent to the one $(D,F^{a\circ\gamma})$
on $L^2(R^n,\Gamma[a\circ\gamma])$. These Dirichlet forms thus share the same spectrum. In a
converse direction, we prove that a homeomorphism $\gamma:U\to\gamma(U)$ between Euclidean
domains, giving rise to an algebraic isomorphism $a\mapsto a\circ\gamma$ between the algebras
of multipliers $M(H^{1,2}(\gamma(A)))$ and $M(H^{1,2}(A))$ of any relatively compact subdomain
$A\subseteq U$ and leaving invariant the corresponding fundamental tones \[ \mu_1(\gamma(A),a)=\mu_1(A,a\circ\gamma)\,
, \] is necessarily the restriction of a M\"obius transformation to $U$. Companion results hold
true for quasi-conformal and bounded distortion maps. Connections between fundamental tones
and ergodic properties of multipliers are studied too. In particular, it is shown that the existence
of a spectral gap for $(D,H^{1,2}(U))$ on $L^2(U,dx)$ implies the non vanishing of the fundamental
tone of $(D,F^a)$ on $L^2(U,\Gamma[a])$, for any multiplier having full support.
