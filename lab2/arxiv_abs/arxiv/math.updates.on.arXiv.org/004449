We consider the calculation of Euler--Lagrange systems of ordinary difference equations, including
the difference Noether's Theorem, in the light of the recently-developed calculus of difference
invariants and discrete moving frames. We introduce the difference moving frame, a natural discrete
moving frame that is adapted to difference equations by prolongation conditions. For any Lagrangian
that is invariant under a Lie group action on the space of dependent variables, we show that the Euler--Lagrange
equations can be calculated directly in terms of the invariants of the group action. Furthermore,
Noether's conservation laws can be written in terms of a difference moving frame and the invariants.
We show that this form of the laws can significantly ease the problem of solving the Euler--Lagrange
equations, and we also show how to use a difference frame to integrate Lie group invariant difference
equations. In this Part I, we illustrate the theory by applications to Lagrangians invariant under
various solvable Lie groups. The theory is also generalized to deal with variational symmetries
that do not leave the Lagrangian invariant. Apart from the study of systems that are inherently discrete,
one significant application is to obtain geometric (variational) integrators that have finite
difference approximations of the continuous conservation laws embedded \textit{a priori}. This
is achieved by taking an invariant finite difference Lagrangian in which the discrete invariants
have the correct continuum limit to their smooth counterparts. We show the calculations for a discretization
of the Lagrangian for Euler's elastica, and compare our discrete solution to that of its smooth continuum
limit.
