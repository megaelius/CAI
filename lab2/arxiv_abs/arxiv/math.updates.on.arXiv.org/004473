Clinical pathways outline standardized processes in the delivery of care for a specific disease.
Patient journeys through the healthcare system, though, can deviate substantially from recommended
or reference pathways. Given the positive benefits of clinical pathways, it is important to measure
the concordance of patient pathways so that variations in health system performance or bottlenecks
in the delivery of care can be detected, monitored, and acted upon. This paper proposes the first
data-driven inverse optimization approach to measuring pathway concordance in any problem context.
Our specific application considers clinical pathway concordance for stage III colon cancer. We
apply our novel concordance metric to a real dataset of colon cancer patients from Ontario, Canada
and show that it has a statistically significant association with survival. Our methodological
approach considers a patient's journey as a walk in a directed graph, where the costs on the arcs are
derived by solving an inverse shortest path problem. The inverse optimization model uses two sources
of information to find the arc costs: reference pathways developed by a provincial cancer agency
(primary) and data from real-world patient-related activity from patients with both positive
and negative clinical outcomes (secondary). Thus, our inverse optimization framework extends
existing models by including data points of both varying "primacy" and "goodness". Data primacy
is addressed through a two-stage approach to imputing the cost vector, while data goodness is addressed
by a hybrid objective function that aims to both minimize and maximize suboptimality error for different
subsets of input data.
