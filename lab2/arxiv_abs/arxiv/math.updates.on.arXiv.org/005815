The goal of this paper is to characterize function distributions that deep learning can or cannot
learn in poly-time. A universality result is proved for SGD-based deep learning and a non-universality
result is proved for GD-based deep learning; this also gives a separation between SGD-based deep
learning and statistical query algorithms: (1) {\it Deep learning with SGD is efficiently universal.}
Any function distribution that can be learned from samples in poly-time can also be learned by a poly-size
neural net trained with SGD on a poly-time initialization with poly-steps, poly-rate and possibly
poly-noise. Therefore deep learning provides a universal learning paradigm: it was known that
the approximation and estimation errors could be controlled with poly-size neural nets, using
ERM that is NP-hard; this new result shows that the optimization error can also be controlled with
SGD in poly-time. The picture changes for GD with large enough batches: (2) {\it Result (1) does not
hold for GD:} Neural nets of poly-size trained with GD (full gradients or large enough batches) on
any initialization with poly-steps, poly-range and at least poly-noise cannot learn any function
distribution that has super-polynomial {\it cross-predictability,} where the cross-predictability
gives a measure of ``average'' function correlation -- relations and distinctions to the statistical
dimension are discussed. In particular, GD with these constraints can learn efficiently monomials
of degree $k$ if and only if $k$ is constant. Thus (1) and (2) point to an interesting contrast: SGD
is universal even with some poly-noise while full GD or SQ algorithms are not (e.g., parities).
