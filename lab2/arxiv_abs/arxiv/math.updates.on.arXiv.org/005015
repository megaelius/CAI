Magnetic helicity is approximately conserved in resistive MHD models. It quantifies the entanglement
of the magnetic field within the plasma. The transport and removal of helicity is crucial in both
the dynamo in the solar interior and active region evolution in the solar corona. This transport
typically leads to highly inhomogeneous distributions of entanglement.There exists no consistent
systematic means of decomposing helicity over varying spatial scales and in localised regions.
We apply a multiresolution wavelet decomposition to the magnetic field and demonstrate how it can
be applied to various quantities associated with magnetic helicity, including the field line helicity.
We use a geometrical definition of helicity which allows these quantities to be calculated for fields
with arbitrary boundary conditions. It is shown that the multiresolution decomposition of helicity
has the crucial property of local additivity and demonstrate a general linear energy-topology
conservation law which is a significant generalisation of the two point correlation decomposition
used in the analysis of homogeneous turbulence and periodic fields. The localisation property
of the wavelet representation is shown to characterise inhomogeneous distributions which a Fourier
representation cannot. Using an analytic representation of a resistive braided field relaxation
we demonstrate a clear correlation between the variations in energy at various length scales and
the variations in helicity at the same spatial scales. Its application to helicity flows in a surface
flux transport model show how various contributions to the global helicity input from active region
field evolution and polar field development are naturally separated by this representation.
