Using elliptic and parabolic regularity results for strongly continuous sub-Markovian contraction
resolvents and semigroups in $L^p$-spaces, we construct for every starting point weak solutions
to SDEs in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space up to their explosion times including the following
conditions. For arbitrary but fixed $p>d$ the diffusion coefficient $A=(a_{ij})$ is supposed
to be locally uniformly strictly elliptic with functions $a_{ij}\in H^{1,p}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^d)$
and for the drift coefficient $\mathbf{G}=(g_1,\dots, g_d)$, we assume $g_i\in L^p_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^d)$.
The solution is by construction a Hunt process with continuous sample paths on the one-point compactification
of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and by a local well-posedness result from \cite{Zh11}, pathwise unique and strong
up to its explosion time. Moreover, just under the given assumptions we show irreducibility and
the $L^{[1,\infty]}(\mathbb{R}^d,m)$-strong Feller property of its transition function, and
the $L^{[q,\infty]}(\mathbb{R}^d,m)$-strong Feller property, $q=\frac{dp}{d+p}\in (d/2,p/2)$,
of its resolvent, which both include the classical strong Feller property. We present moment inequalities
for the solution, and non-explosion criteria which allow at the same time for linear growth, singularities
of the drift coefficient inside an arbitrarily large compact set, an interplay between the drift
and the diffusion coefficient and superlinear growth. This leads to pathwise uniqueness results
up to infinity under presumably optimal general non-explosion conditions. We further present
explicit conditions for recurrence and ergodicity, including existence as well as uniqueness
of invariant measures. Our work complements and improves substantially existing literature on
time-homogeneous It\^o-SDEs with merely locally integrable drifts and Sobolev diffusion coefficients.
