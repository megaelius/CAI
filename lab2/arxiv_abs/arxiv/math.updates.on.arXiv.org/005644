Methods for quantifying the effects of uncertainties in hyperbolic problems can be divided into
intrusive and non-intrusive techniques. Non-intrusive methods allow the usage of a given deterministic
solver in a black-box manner, while being embarrassingly parallel. However, avoiding intrusive
modifications of a given solver takes away the ability to use several inherently intrusive numerical
acceleration tools. Moreover, intrusive methods are expected to reach a given accuracy with a smaller
number of unknowns compared to non-intrusive techniques. This effect is amplified in settings
with high dimensional uncertainty. A downside of intrusive methods is however the need to guarantee
hyperbolicity of the resulting moment system. In contrast to stochastic-Galerkin (SG), the Intrusive
Polynomial Moment (IPM) method is able to maintain hyperbolicity at the cost of solving an optimization
problem in every spatial cell and every time step. In this work, we propose several acceleration
techniques for intrusive methods and study their advantages and shortcomings compared to the non-intrusive
stochastic-Collocation method. When solving steady problems with IPM, the numerical costs arising
from repeatedly solving the IPM optimization problem can be reduced by using concepts from PDE-constrained
optimization. Additionally, we propose an adaptive implementation and efficient parallelization
strategy of the IPM method. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptations is demonstrated for multi-dimensional
uncertainties in fluid dynamics applications, resulting in the observation of requiring a smaller
number of unknowns to achieve a given accuracy when using intrusive methods. Furthermore, using
the proposed acceleration techniques, our implementation reaches a given accuracy faster than
stochastic-Collocation.
