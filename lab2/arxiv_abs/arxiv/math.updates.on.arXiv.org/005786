This paper compares two basic approaches to solving ordinary differential equations, which form
the basis for attitude computation in strapdown inertial navigation systems, namely, the Taylor
series expansion approach that was used in its low-order form for deriving all mainstream algorithms
and the functional iterative integration approach developed recently. They are respectively
applied to solve the kinematic equations of major attitude parameters, including the quaternion,
the Rodrigues vector and the rotation vector. Specifically, the mainstream algorithms, which
have relied on the simplified rotation vector without exception, are considerably extended by
the Taylor series expansion approach using the exact rotation vector and recursive calculation
of high-order derivatives. The functional iterative integration approach is respectively implemented
on both the normal polynomial and the Chebyshev polynomial. Numerical results under the classical
coning motion are reported to assess all derived attitude algorithms. It is revealed that in the
relative frequency range when the coning to sampling frequency ratio is below 0.05-0.1 (depending
on the chosen polynomial truncation order), all algorithms have the same order of accuracy if the
same number of samples are used to fit the angular velocity over the iteration interval; in the range
of higher relative frequency, the group of Quat/Rod/RotFIter algorithms (by the functional iterative
integration approach combined with the Chebyshev polynomial) perform the best in both accuracy
and robustness, thanks to the excellent numerical stability and powerful functional representation
capability of the Chebyshev polynomial.
