Fix $n \geq 2$ an integer, and let $F$ be a totally real number field. We reduce the shifted convolution
problem for $L$-function coefficients of $\operatorname{GL}_n({\bf{A}}_F)$-automorphic
forms to the better-understood setting of $\operatorname{GL}_2({\bf{A}}_F)$ via new integral
presentations derived from Fourier-Whittaker expansions of projected cusp forms. As one application
of this reduction, we derive the following uniform asymptotic subconvexity bound for $\operatorname{GL}_n({\bf{A}}_F)$-automorphic
$L$-functions twisted by Hecke characters. Let $\Pi$ be an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation
of $\operatorname{GL}_n({\bf{A}}_F)$, and let $\chi$ be a Hecke character of $F$ of conductor
$\mathfrak{q}$. Let $\theta_0$ be the best known approximation to the generalized Ramanujan-Petersson
conjecture for $\operatorname{GL}_2({\bf{A}}_F)$-automorphic forms; hence $\theta_0 = 0$
is conjectured, and $\theta_0 = 7/64$ is admissible by the theorem of Blomer and Brumley. Writing
$L(s, \Pi \otimes \chi)$ to denote the finite part of the standard $L$-function of $\Pi \otimes \chi$,
normalized to have central value at $s = 1/2$, we show that for any $\varepsilon >0$ we have the upper
bound \begin{align*} L(1/2, \Pi \otimes \chi) &\ll_{\Pi, \chi_{\infty}, \varepsilon} {\bf{N}}
\mathfrak{q}^{\frac{n}{4}(\frac{1}{2} + \theta_0) + \frac{5}{16} - \frac{\theta_0}{2}},
\end{align*} and even $L(1/2, \Pi \otimes \chi) \ll_{\Pi, \chi_{\infty}, \varepsilon} {\bf{N}}
\mathfrak{q}^{\frac{n}{4}(\frac{1}{2} + \theta_0) + \varepsilon}$ if $n \geq 4$. Here, the implied
constants depend only on the representation $\Pi$, the archimedean component $\chi_{\infty}$
of $\chi$, and the totally real field $F$. This estimate appears to the the first of its kind in higher
dimensions.
