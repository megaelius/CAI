We analyze a class of the BCS model, whose free dispersion relation is non-vanishing, under the influence
of imaginary magnetic field at positive temperature. The magnitude of the negative coupling constant
must be small but is allowed to be independent of the temperature and the imaginary magnetic field.
The infinite-volume limit of the free energy density is characterized. A spontaneous symmetry
breaking and an off-diagonal long range order are proved to occur only in high temperatures. This
is because the gap equation in this model has a positive solution only if the temperature is higher
than a critical value. The proof is based on a double-scale integration of the Grassmann integral
formulation. In this scheme we integrate with the infrared covariance first and with the ultra-violet
covariance afterwards. As the other focus, we study geometric properties of the phase boundaries,
which are periodic copies of a closed curve in the two-dimensional space of the temperature and the
real time variable. Here we adopt the real time variable in place of the temperature times the imaginary
magnetic field by considering its relevance within contemporary physics of dynamical phase transition
at positive temperature. As the main result, we show that for any choice of a non-vanishing free dispersion
relation the representative curve of the phase boundaries has only one local minimum point, or in
other words the phase boundaries do not oscillate with temperature, if and only if the minimum of
the magnitude of the free dispersion relation over the maximum is larger than the critical value
$\sqrt{17-12\sqrt{2}}$.
