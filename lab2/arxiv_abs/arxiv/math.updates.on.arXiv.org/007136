In arXiv:1901.02990v1 the equivariant quantum differential equation ($qDE$) for a projective
space was considered and a compatible system of difference $qKZ$ equations was introduced; the
space of solutions to the joint system of the $qDE$ and $qKZ$ equations was identified with the space
of the equivariant $K$-theory algebra of the projective space; Stokes bases in the space of solutions
were identified with exceptional bases in the equivariant $K$-theory algebra. This paper is a continuation
of arXiv:1901.02990v1. We describe the relation between solutions to the joint system of the $qDE$
and $qKZ$ equations and the topological-enumerative solution to the $qDE$ only, defined as a generating
function of equivariant descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. The relation is in terms of the equivariant
graded Chern character on the equivariant $K$-theory algebra, the equivariant Gamma class of the
projective space, and the equivariant first Chern class of the tangent bundle of the projective
space. We consider a Stokes basis, the associated exceptional basis in the equivariant $K$-theory
algebra, and the associated Stokes matrix. We show that the Stokes matrix equals the Gram matrix
of the equivariant Grothendieck-Euler-Poincar\'{e} pairing wrt to the basis, which is the left
dual to the associated exceptional basis. We identify the Stokes bases in the space of solutions
with explicit full exceptional collections in the equivariant derived category of coherent sheaves
on the projective space, where the elements of those exceptional collections are just line bundles
on the projective space and exterior powers of the tangent bundle of the projective space. These
statements are equivariant analogs of results of G. Cotti, B. Dubrovin, D. Guzzetti, and S. Galkin,
V. Golyshev, H. Iritani.
