We consider a market in which capacity-constrained generators compete in scalar-parameterized
supply functions to serve an inelastic demand spread throughout a transmission constrained power
network. The market clears according to a locational marginal pricing mechanism, in which the independent
system operator (ISO) determines the generators' production quantities to minimize the revealed
cost of meeting demand, while ensuring that network transmission and generator capacity constraints
are met. Under the stylizing assumption that both the ISO and generators choose their strategies
simultaneously, we establish the existence of Nash equilibria for the underlying market, and derive
an upper bound on the allocative efficiency loss at Nash equilibrium relative to the socially optimal
level. We also characterize an upper bound on the markup of locational marginal prices at Nash equilibrium
above their perfectly competitive levels. Of particular relevance to ex ante market power monitoring,
these bounds reveal the role of certain market structures---specifically, the market share and
residual supply index of a producer---in predicting the degree to which that producer is able to
exercise market power to influence the market outcome to its advantage. Finally, restricting our
attention to the simpler setting of a two-node power network, we provide a characterization of market
structures under which a Braess-like paradox occurs due to the exercise of market power---that
is to say, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition on market structure under which the strengthening
of the network's transmission line capacity results in the (counterintuitive) increase in the
total cost of generation at Nash equilibrium.
