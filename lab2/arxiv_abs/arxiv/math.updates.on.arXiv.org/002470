Spectral clustering is a celebrated algorithm that partitions objects based on pairwise similarity
information. While this approach has been successfully applied to a variety of domains, it comes
with limitations. The reason is that there are many other applications in which only \emph{multi}-way
similarity measures are available. This motivates us to explore the multi-way measurement setting.
In this work, we develop two algorithms intended for such setting: Hypergraph Spectral Clustering
(HSC) and Hypergraph Spectral Clustering with Local Refinement (HSCLR). Our main contribution
lies in performance analysis of the poly-time algorithms under a random hypergraph model, which
we name the weighted stochastic block model, in which objects and multi-way measures are modeled
as nodes and weights of hyperedges, respectively. Denoting by $n$ the number of nodes, our analysis
reveals the following: (1) HSC outputs a partition which is better than a random guess if the sum of
edge weights (to be explained later) is $\Omega(n)$; (2) HSC outputs a partition which coincides
with the hidden partition except for a vanishing fraction of nodes if the sum of edge weights is $\omega(n)$;
and (3) HSCLR exactly recovers the hidden partition if the sum of edge weights is on the order of $n
\log n$. Our results improve upon the state of the arts recently established under the model and they
firstly settle the order-wise optimal results for the binary edge weight case. Moreover, we show
that our results lead to efficient sketching algorithms for subspace clustering, a computer vision
application. Lastly, we show that HSCLR achieves the information-theoretic limits for a special
yet practically relevant model, thereby showing no computational barrier for the case.
