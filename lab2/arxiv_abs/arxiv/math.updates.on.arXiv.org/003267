In the last two decades the study of random instances of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)
has flourished across several disciplines, including computer science, mathematics and physics.
The diversity of the developed methods, on the rigorous and non-rigorous side, has led to major advances
regarding both the theoretical as well as the applied viewpoints. The two most popular types of such
CSPs are the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and the random regular CSPs. Based on a ceteris paribus approach
in terms of the density evolution equations known from statistical physics, we focus on a specific
prominent class of problems of the latter type, the so-called occupation problems. The regular
$r$-in-$k$ occupation problems resemble a basis of this class. By now, out of these CSPs only the
satisfiability threshold - the largest degree for which the problem admits asymptotically a solution
- for the $1$-in-$k$ occupation problem has been rigorously established. In the present work we
take a general approach towards a systematic analysis of occupation problems. In particular, we
discover a surprising and explicit connection between the $2$-in-$k$ occupation problem satisfiability
threshold and the determination of contraction coefficients, an important quantity in information
theory measuring the loss of information that occurs when communicating through a noisy channel.
We present methods to facilitate the computation of these coefficients and use them to establish
explicitly the threshold for the $2$-in-$k$ occupation problem for $k=4$. Based on this result,
for general $k \ge 5$ we formulate a conjecture that pins down the exact value of the corresponding
coefficient, which, if true, is shown to determine the threshold in all these cases.
