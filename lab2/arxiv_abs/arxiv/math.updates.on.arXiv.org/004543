In this paper, we study the power control problem for Over-the-air computation (AirComp) over fading
channels. Our objective is to minimize the computation error by jointly optimizing the transmit
power at the power-constrained devices and a signal scaling factor (called denoising factor) at
the fusion center (FC). The problem is generally non-convex due to the coupling of the transmit power
over devices and denoising factor at the FC. To tackle the challenge, we first consider the special
case with static channels, for which we derive the optimal solution in closed form. The optimal power
control exhibits a threshold-based structure. Specifically, for each device, if the product of
the channel quality and power budget, called quality indicator, exceeds an optimized threshold,
this device applies channel-inversion power control; otherwise, it performs full power transmission.
Building on the results, we proceed to consider the general case with time-varying channels. To
solve the more challenging non-convex power control problem, we use the Lagrange-duality method
via exploiting its "time-sharing" property. The derived optimal power control exhibits a regularized
channel inversion structure, where the regularization has the function of balancing the tradeoff
between the signal-magnitude alignment and noise suppression. Moreover, for the special case
with only one device being power limited, we show that the optimal power control for the power-limited
device has an interesting channel-inversion water-filling structure, while those for other devices
(with sufficient power budgets) reduce to channel-inversion power control over all fading states.
