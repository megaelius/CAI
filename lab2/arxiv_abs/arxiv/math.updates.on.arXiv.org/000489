This paper extends some results on the S-Lemma proposed by Yakubovich and uses the improved results
to investigate the asymptotic stability of a class of switched nonlinear systems. Firstly, the
strict S-Lemma is extended from quadratic forms to homogeneous functions with respect to any dilation,
where the improved S-Lemma is named the strict homogeneous S-Lemma (the SHS-Lemma for short). In
detail, this paper indicates that the strict S-Lemma does not necessarily hold for homogeneous
functions that are not quadratic forms, and proposes a necessary and sufficient condition under
which the SHS-Lemma holds. It is well known that a switched linear system with two sub-systems admits
a Lyapunov function with homogeneous derivative (LFHD for short), if and only if it has a convex combination
of the vector fields of its two sub-systems that admits a LFHD. In this paper, it is shown that this
conclusion does not necessarily hold for a general switched nonlinear system with two sub-systems,
and gives a necessary and sufficient condition under which the conclusion holds for a general switched
nonlinear system with two sub-systems. It is also shown that for a switched nonlinear system with
three or more sub-systems, the "if" part holds, but the "only if" part may not. At last, the S-Lemma
is extended from quadratic polynomials to polynomials of degree more than $2$ under some mild conditions,
and the improved results are called the homogeneous S-Lemma (the HS-Lemma for short) and the non-homogeneous
S-Lemma (the NHS-Lemma for short), respectively. Besides, some examples and counterexamples
are given to illustrate the main results.
