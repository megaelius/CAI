We continue to consider the discrete decreasing minimization problem on an integral base-polyhedron
treated in Part I. The problem is to find a lexicographically minimal integral vector in an integral
base-polyhedron, where the components of a vector are arranged in a decreasing order. This study
can be regarded as a discrete counter-part of the work by Fujishige (1980) on the lexicographically
optimal base and the principal partition of a base-polyhedron in continuous variables. The objective
of Part II is two-fold. The first is to offer structural views from discrete convex analysis (DCA)
on the results of Part I obtained by the constructive and algorithmic approach. The second objective
is to pave the way of DCA approach to discrete decreasing minimization on other discrete structures
(the intersection of M-convex sets, flows, submodular flows) that we consider in Parts III and IV.
A direct characterization is given to the canonical partition, which was constructed by an iterative
procedure in Part~I. This reveals the precise relationship between the canonical partition for
the discrete case and the principal partition for the continuous case. Moreover, this result entails
a proximity theorem, stating that every decreasingly minimal element is contained in the small
box containing the (unique) fractional decreasingly minimal element (the minimum-norm point),
leading further to a continuous relaxation algorithm for finding a decreasingly minimal element
of an M-convex set. Thus the relationship between the continuous and discrete cases is completely
clarified. Furthermore, we present DCA min-max formulas to be needed in Parts III and IV, where the
discrete decreasing minimization problem is considered for network flows, the intersection of
two M-convex sets, and submodular flows.
