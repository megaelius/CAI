This paper studies an infinite horizon optimal consumption problem under exponential utility,
together with non-negativity constraint on consumption rate and a reference point to the past consumption
peak. The performance is measured by the distance between the consumption rate and a fraction $0\leq\lambda\leq
1$ of the historical consumption maximum. To overcome its path-dependent nature, the consumption
running maximum process is chosen as an auxiliary state process that renders the value function
two dimensional depending on the wealth variable $x$ and the reference variable $h$. The associated
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is expressed in the piecewise manner across different
regions to take into account constraints. By employing the dual transform and smooth-fit principle,
the classical solution of the HJB equation is obtained in an analytical form, which in turn provides
the feedback optimal investment and consumption. For $0<\lambda<1$, we are able to find four boundary
curves $x_1(h)$, $\breve{x}(h)$, $x_2(h)$ and $x_3(h)$ for the wealth level $x$ that are nonlinear
functions of $h$ such that the feedback optimal consumption satisfies: (i) $c^*(x,h)=0$ when $x\leq
x_1(h)$; (ii) $0<c^*(x,h)<\lambda h$ when $x_1(h)<x<\breve{x}(h)$; (iii) $\lambda h\leq c^*(x,h)<h$
when $\breve{x}(h)\leq x<x_2(h)$; (iv) $c^*(x,h)=h$ but the running maximum process remains
flat when $x_2(h)\leq x<x_3(h)$; (v) $c^*(x,h)=h$ and the running maximum process increases when
$x=x_3(h)$. Similar conclusions can be made in a simpler fashion for two extreme cases $\lambda=0$
and $\lambda=1$. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate some theoretical results
and financial insights.
