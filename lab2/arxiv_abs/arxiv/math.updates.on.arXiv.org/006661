In the context of the Paris Agreement, Chile has pledged to reduce Greenhouse Gases (GHG) intensity
by at least 30% below 2007 levels by 2030, and to phase out coal as a energy source by 2040, among other
strategies. In pursue of these goals, Chile has implemented a $5 per tonne of CO2 emission tax, first
of its kind in Latin America. However, such a low price has proven to be insufficient. In our work,
we study an alternative approach for capping and pricing carbon emissions in the Chilean electric
sector; the cap and trade paradigm. We model the Chilean electric market (generators and emissions
auctioneer) as a two stage capacity expansion equilibrium problem, where we allow future investment
and trading of emission permits among generator agents. The model studies generation and future
investments in the Chilean electric sector in two regimes of demand: deterministic and stochastic.
We show that the current Chilean Greenhouse Gases (GHG) intensity pledge does not drive an important
shift in the future Chilean electric matrix. To encourage a shift to greener technologies, a more
stringent carbon budget must be considered, resulting in a carbon price approximately ten times
higher than the present one. We also show that achieving the emissions reduction goal does not necessarily
results in further reductions of carbon generation, or phasing out coal in the longer term. Finally,
we demonstrate that under technology change costs reductions, higher demand scenarios will relax
the need for stringent carbon budgets to achieve new renewable energy investments and hence meet
the Chilean pledges. These results suggest that some aspects of the Chilean pledge require further
analysis, of the economic impact, particularly with the recent announcement of achieving carbon
neutrality towards 2050.
