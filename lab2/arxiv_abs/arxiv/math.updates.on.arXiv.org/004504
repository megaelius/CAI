We present an efficient method to solve the narrow capture and narrow escape problems for the sphere.
The narrow capture problem models the equilibrium behavior of a Brownian particle in the exterior
of a sphere whose surface is reflective, except for a collection of small absorbing patches. The
narrow escape problem is the dual problem: it models the behavior of a Brownian particle confined
to the interior of a sphere whose surface is reflective, except for a collection of small patches
through which it can escape. Mathematically, these give rise to mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
value problems of the Poisson equation. They are numerically challenging for two main reasons:
(1) the solutions are non-smooth at Dirichlet-Neumann interfaces, and (2) they involve adaptive
mesh refinement and the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear systems when the number of small
patches is large. By using the Neumann Green's functions for the sphere, we recast each boundary
value problem as a system of first-kind integral equations on the collection of patches. A block-diagonal
preconditioner together with a multiple scattering formalism leads to a well-conditioned system
of second-kind integral equations and a very efficient approach to discretization. This system
is solved iteratively using GMRES. We develop a hierarchical, fast multipole method-like algorithm
to accelerate each matrix-vector product. Our method is insensitive to the patch size, and the total
cost scales with the number N of patches as O(N log N), after a precomputation whose cost depends only
on the patch size and not on the number or arrangement of patches. We demonstrate the method with several
numerical examples, and are able to achieve highly accurate solutions with 100,000 patches in one
hour on a 60-core workstation.
