This paper is concerned with voting processes on graphs where each vertex holds one of two different
opinions. In particular, we study the \emph{Best-of-two} and the \emph{Best-of-three}. Here
at each synchronous and discrete time step, each vertex updates its opinion to match the majority
among the opinions of two random neighbors and itself (the Best-of-two) or the opinions of three
random neighbors (the Best-of-three). Previous studies have explored these processes on complete
graphs and expander graphs, but we understand significantly less about their properties on graphs
with more complicated structures. In this paper, we study the Best-of-two and the Best-of-three
on the stochastic block model $G(2n,p,q)$, which is a random graph consisting of two distinct Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
graphs $G(n,p)$ joined by random edges with density $q\leq p$. We obtain two main results. First,
if $p=\omega(\log n/n)$ and $r=q/p$ is a constant, we show that there is a phase transition in $r$
with threshold $r^*$ (specifically, $r^*=\sqrt{5}-2$ for the Best-of-two, and $r^*=1/7$ for
the Best-of-three). If $r>r^*$, the process reaches consensus within $O(\log \log n+\log n/\log
(np))$ steps for any initial opinion configuration with a bias of $\Omega(n)$. By contrast, if $r<r^*$,
then there exists an initial opinion configuration with a bias of $\Omega(n)$ from which the process
requires at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$ steps to reach consensus. Second, if $p$ is a constant and $r>r^*$,
we show that, for any initial opinion configuration, the process reaches consensus within $O(\log
n)$ steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result concerning multiple-choice voting
for arbitrary initial opinion configurations on non-complete graphs.
