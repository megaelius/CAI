Here we consider a game theoretic model of multilevel selection in which individuals compete based
on their payoff and groups also compete based on the average payoff of group members. Our focus is
on multilevel social dilemmas: games in which individuals are best off cheating, while groups of
individuals do best when composed of many cooperators. We analyze the dynamics of the two-level
replicator dynamics, a nonlocal hyperbolic PDE describing deterministic birth-death dynamics
for both individuals and groups. While past work on such multilevel dynamics has restricted attention
to scenarios with exactly solvable within-group dynamics, we use comparison principles and an
invariant property of the tail of the population distribution to extend our analysis to all possible
two-player, two-strategy social dilemmas. We characterize the threshold level of between-group
selection dividing a regime in which the population converges to a delta function at the equilibrium
of the within-group dynamics from a regime in which between-group competition facilitates the
existence of steady-state densities supporting greater levels of cooperation. In particular,
we see that the threshold selection strength and average payoff at steady state depend on a tug-of-war
between the individual-level incentive to be a defector in a many-cooperator group and the group-level
incentive to have many cooperators over many defectors. We also find that lower-level selection
casts a long shadow: if groups are best off with a mix of cooperators and defectors, then there will
always be fewer cooperators than optimal at steady state, even in the limit of infinitely strong
competition between groups.
