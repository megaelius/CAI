In this paper we consider $C^\infty $-generic families of area-preserving diffeomorphisms of
the torus homotopic to the identity and their rotation sets. Let $f_t:\rm{T^2\rightarrow T^2}$
be such a family, $\widetilde{f}_t:\rm I\negthinspace R^2 \rightarrow \rm I\negthinspace R^2$
be a fixed family of lifts and $\rho (\widetilde{f}_t)$ be their rotation sets, which we assume to
have interior for $t$ in a certain open interval $I.$ We also assume that some rational point $(\frac
pq,\frac rq)\in \partial \rho (\widetilde{f}_{\overline{t}})$ for a certain parameter $\overline{t}\in
I$ and we want to understand consequences of the following hypothesis: For all $t>\overline{t},$
$t\in I,$ $(\frac pq,\frac rq)\in int(\partial \rho (\widetilde{f}_t)).$ Under these very natural
assumptions, we prove that there exists a $f_{\overline{t}}^q$-fixed hyperbolic saddle $P_{\overline{t}}$
such that its rotation vector is $(\frac pq,\frac rq)$ and, there exists a sequence $t_i>\overline{t},$
$t_i\rightarrow \overline{t},$ such that if $P_t$ is the continuation of $P_{\overline{t}}$
with the parameter, then $W^u(\widetilde{P}_{t_i})$ (the unstable manifold) has quadratic tangencies
with $W^s(\widetilde{P}_{t_i})+(c,d)$ (the stable manifold translated by $(c,d)),$ where $\widetilde{P}_{t_i}$
is any lift of $P_{t_i}$ to the plane, in other words, $\widetilde{P}_{t_i}$ is a fixed point for
$(\widetilde{f}_{t_i})^q-(p,r),$ and $(c,d)\neq (0,0)$ are certain integer vectors such that
$W^u(\widetilde{P}_{\overline{t}})$ do not intersect $W^s(\widetilde{P}_{\overline{t}})+(c,d).$
And these tangencies become transverse as $t$ increases.
