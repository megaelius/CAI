Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication is a promising technology to extend coverage
and enhance throughput for traditional terrestrial wireless communication systems. In this paper,
we consider a UAV-enabled wireless sensor network (WSN), where a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched
to collect data from a group of sensor nodes (SNs). The objective is to maximize the minimum data collection
rate from all SNs via jointly optimizing their transmission scheduling and power allocations as
well as the trajectory of the UAV, subject to the practical constraints on the maximum transmit power
of the SNs and the maximum speed of the UAV. The formulated optimization problem is challenging to
solve as it involves non-convex constraints and discrete-value variables. To draw useful insight,
we first consider the special case of the formulated problem by ignoring the UAV speed constraint
and optimally solve it based on the Lagrange duality method. It is shown that for this relaxed problem,
the UAV should hover above a finite number of optimal locations with different durations in general.
Next, we address the general case of the formulated problem where the UAV speed constraint is considered
and propose a traveling salesman problem (TSP)-based trajectory initialization, where the UAV
sequentially visits the locations obtained in the relaxed problem with minimum flying time. Given
this initial trajectory, we then find the corresponding transmission scheduling and power allocations
of the SNs and further optimize the UAV trajectory by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD)
and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Finally, numerical results are provided
to illustrate the spectrum and energy efficiency gains of the proposed scheme for multi-antenna
UAV data harvesting, as compared to benchmark schemes.
