The nonlinear and ill-posed nature of full waveform inversion (FWI) requires us to use sophisticated
regularization techniques to solve it. In most applications, the model parameters may be described
by physical properties (e.g., wave speeds, density, attenuation, anisotropic parameters) which
are piecewise functions of space. Compound regularizations are thus necessary to reconstruct
properly such parameters by FWI. We consider different implementations of compound regularizations
in the wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) method, a formulation of FWI that extends its search
space and prevent the so-called cycle skipping pathology. Our hybrid regularizations rely on Tikhonov
and total variation (TV) functionals, from which we build two classes of hybrid regularizers: the
first class is simply obtained by a convex combination (CC) of the two functionals, while the second
relies on their infimal convolution (IC). In the former class, the model of parameters is required
to simultaneously satisfy different priors, while in the latter the model is broken into its basic
components, each satisfying a distinct prior (e.g. smooth, piecewise constant, piecewise linear).
We implement these types of compound regularizations in the WRI optimization problem using the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then, we assess our regularized WRI in the
framework of seismic imaging applications. Using a wide range of subsurface models, we conclude
that compound regularizer based on IC leads to the lowest error in the parameter reconstruction
compared to that obtained with the CC counterpart and the Tikhonov and TV regularizers when used
independently.
