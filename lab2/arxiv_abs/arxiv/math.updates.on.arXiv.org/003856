In a previous paper we developed a regularity and compactness theory in Euclidean ambient spaces
for codimension 1 weakly stable CMC integral varifolds satisfying two (necessary) structural
conditions. Here we generalize this theory to the setting where the mean curvature (of the regular
part of the varifold) is prescribed by a given $C^{1, \alpha}$ ambient function $g$ and the ambient
space is a general $(n+1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold; we give general conditions that imply
that the support of the varifold, away from a possible singular set of dimension $\leq n-7,$ is the
image of a $C^{2}$ immersion with continuous unit normal $\nu$ and mean curvature $g\nu$. These
conditions also identify a compact class of varifolds subject to an additional uniform mass bound.
If $g$ does not vanish anywhere, or more generally if the set $\{g=0\}$ is sufficiently small (e.g.
if ${\mathcal H}^{n}\,(\{g=0\})=0$), then the results and their proofs are quite analogous to
the CMC case. When $g$ is arbitrary however, a number of additional considerations must be taken
into account: first, the correct second variation assumption is that of finite Morse index (rather
than weak stability); secondly, to have a geometrically useful theory with compactness conclusions,
one of the two structural conditions on the varifold must be weakened; thirdly, in view of easy examples,
this weakening of a structural hypothesis necessitates additional hypotheses in order to reach
the same conclusion. We identify two sets of additional assumptions under which this conclusion
holds for general $g$: one of them gives regularity and compactness, the other one gives regularity
and is applicable to certain phase transition problems. We also provide corollaries for multiplicity
$1$ varifolds associated to reduced boundaries of Caccioppoli sets. In these cases, some or all
of the structural assumptions become redundant.
