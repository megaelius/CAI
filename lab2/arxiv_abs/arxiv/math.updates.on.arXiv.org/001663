This paper studies density estimation under pointwise loss in the setting of contamination model.
The goal is to estimate $f(x_0)$ at some $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$ with i.i.d. observations, $$ X_1,\dots,X_n\sim
(1-\epsilon)f+\epsilon g, $$ where $g$ stands for a contamination distribution. In the context
of multiple testing, this can be interpreted as estimating the null density at a point. We carefully
study the effect of contamination on estimation through the following model indices: contamination
proportion $\epsilon$, smoothness of target density $\beta_0$, smoothness of contamination
density $\beta_1$, and level of contamination $m$ at the point to be estimated, i.e. $g(x_0)\leq
m$. It is shown that the minimax rate with respect to the squared error loss is of order $$ [n^{-\frac{2\beta_0}{2\beta_0+1}}]\vee[\epsilon^2(1\wedge
m)^2]\vee[n^{-\frac{2\beta_1}{2\beta_1+1}}\epsilon^{\frac{2}{2\beta_1+1}}], $$ which
characterizes the exact influence of contamination on the difficulty of the problem. We then establish
the minimal cost of adaptation to contamination proportion, to smoothness and to both of the numbers.
It is shown that some small price needs to be paid for adaptation in any of the three cases. Variations
of Lepski's method are considered to achieve optimal adaptation. The problem is also studied when
there is no smoothness assumption on the contamination distribution. This setting that allows
for an arbitrary contamination distribution is recognized as Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination
model. The minimax rate is shown to be $$ [n^{-\frac{2\beta_0}{2\beta_0+1}}]\vee [\epsilon^{\frac{2\beta_0}{\beta_0+1}}].
$$ The adaptation theory is also different from the smooth contamination case. While adaptation
to either contamination proportion or smoothness only costs a logarithmic factor, adaptation
to both numbers is proved to be impossible.
