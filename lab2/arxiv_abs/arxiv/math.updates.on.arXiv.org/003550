In AC electrical systems, the power depends on the real power (P) due to resistive elements and the
reactive power (Q) due to the inductive and capacitive elements, which are commonly studied by using
phasor and scalar methods. Thus, this paper focuses on applying the fractal Julia sets to observe
the topological properties related to the signs and magnitudes of the real and reactive powers consumed
or supplied by an electrical circuit. To perform this, different power combinations were used to
represent the fractal diagrams with an algorithm that considers the mathematical model of Julia
sets. The study considers three type of loads: the first study considers the change of real power
when the reactive power is fixed; the second study deals with the change of the reactive power when
the real power is fixed; and finally, the third study contemplates that both real and reactive powers
change. Furthermore, the fractal diagrams of the power in the four quadrants of the complex plane
are studied to identify the topological properties that each sign and magnitude represent. A qualitative
analysis of the diagrams helps to identify that the complex power loads present some fractal graphic
patterns, with respect to the signs and magnitudes considered in the different quadrants of the
complex planes. The diagrams represented in the complex planes save a relation in the forms and structure
with other points studied, concluding that the power is related to other figures in other quadrants.
Thus, this result allows a new study of the behavior of the power in an electrical circuit, showing
a clear relation of the different fractal diagrams that the Julia sets obtained.
