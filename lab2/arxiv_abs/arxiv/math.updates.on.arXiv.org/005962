Quantum games represent the really 21st century branch of game theory, tightly linked to the modern
development of quantum computing and quantum technologies. The main accent in these developments
so far was made on stationary or repeated games. In this paper we aim at initiating the truly dynamic
theory with strategies chosen by players in real time. Since direct continuous observations are
known to destroy quantum evolutions (so-called quantum Zeno paradox) the necessary new ingredient
for quantum dynamic games must be the theory of non-direct observations and the corresponding quantum
filtering. Apart from the technical problems in organising feedback quantum control in real time,
the difficulty in applying this theory for obtaining mathematically amenable control systems
is due partially to the fact that it leads usually to rather nontrivial jump-type Markov processes
and/or degenerate diffusions on manifolds, for which the corresponding control is very difficult
to handle. The starting point for the present research is the remarkable discovery (quite unexpected,
at least to the author) that there exists a very natural class of homodyne detections such that the
diffusion processes on projective spaces resulting by filtering under such arrangements coincide
exactly with the standard Brownian motions (BM) on these spaces. In some cases one can even reduce
the process to the plain BM on Euclidean spaces or tori. The theory of such motions is well studied
making it possible to develop a tractable theory of related control and games, which can be at the
same time practically implemented on quantum optical devices.
