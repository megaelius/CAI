We present a forward-backward-based algorithm to minimize a sum of a differentiable function and
a nonsmooth function, both being possibly nonconvex. The main contribution of this work is to consider
the challenging case where the nonsmooth function corresponds to a sum of non-convex functions,
resulting from composition between a strictly increasing, concave, differentiable function
and a convex nonsmooth function. The proposed variable metric Composite Function Forward-Backward
algorithm (C2FB) circumvents the explicit, and often challenging, computation of the proximity
operator of the composite functions through a majorize-minimize approach. Precisely, each composite
function is majorized using a linear approximation of the differentiable function, which allows
one to apply the proximity step only to the sum of the nonsmooth functions. We prove the convergence
of the algorithm iterates to a critical point of the objective function leveraging the Kurdyka-\L
ojasiewicz inequality. The convergence is guaranteed even if the proximity operators are computed
inexactly, considering relative errors. We show that the proposed approach is a generalization
of reweighting methods, with convergence guarantees. In particular, applied to the log-sum function,
our algorithm reduces to a generalized version of the celebrated reweighted $\ell_1$ method. Finally,
we show through simulations on an image processing problem that the proposed C2FB algorithm necessitates
less iterations to converge and leads to better critical points compared with traditional reweighting
methods and classic forward-backward algorithms.
