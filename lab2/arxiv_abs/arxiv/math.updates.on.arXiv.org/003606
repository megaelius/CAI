Among bivariate tail dependence measures, the tail dependence coefficient has emerged as the popular
choice. Akin to the correlation matrix, a multivariate dependence measure is constructed using
these bivariate measures, and this is referred to in the literature as the tail dependence matrix
(TDM). While the problem of determining whether a given ${d\times d}$ matrix is a correlation matrix
is of the order $O(d^3)$ in complexity, determining if a matrix is a TDM (the realization problem)
is believed to be non-polynomial in complexity. Using a linear programming (LP) formulation, we
show that the combinatorial structure of the constraints is related to the intractable max-cut
problem in a weighted graph. This connection provides an avenue for constructing parametric classes
admitting a polynomial in $d$ algorithm for determining membership in its constraint polytope.
The complexity of the general realization problem is justifiably of much theoretical interest.
Since in practice one resorts to lower dimensional parametrization of the TDMs, we posit that it
is rather the complexity of the realization problem restricted to parametric classes of TDMs, and
algorithms for it, that are more practically relevant. In this paper, we show how the inherent symmetry
and sparsity in a parametrization can be exploited to achieve a significant reduction in the LP formulation,
which can lead to polynomial complexity of such realization problems - some parametrizations even
resulting in the constraint polytope being independent of $d$. We also explore the use of a probabilistic
viewpoint on TDMs to derive the constraint polytopes.
