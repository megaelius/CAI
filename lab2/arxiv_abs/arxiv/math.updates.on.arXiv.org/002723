The goal of this work is to decompose random populations with a genealogy in subfamilies of a given
degree of kinship and to obtain a notion of infinitely divisible genealogies. We model the genealogical
structure of a population by (equivalence classes of) ultrametric measure spaces (um-spaces)
as elements of the Polish space U which we recall. In order to then analyze the family structure in
this coding we introduce an algebraic structure on um-spaces (a consistent collection of semigroups).
This allows us to obtain a path of collections of subfamilies of fixed kinship h (described as ultrametric
measure spaces), for every depth h as a measurable functional of the genealogy. Random elements
in the semigroup are studied, in particular infinitely divisible random variables. Here we define
infinite divisibility of random genealogies as the property that the h-tops can be represented
as concatenation of independent identically distributed h-forests for every h and obtain a Levy-Khintchine
representation of this object and a corresponding representation via a concatenation of points
of a Poisson point process of h-forests. Finally the case of discrete and marked um-spaces is treated
allowing to apply the results to both the individual based and most important spatial populations.
The results have various applications. In particular the case of the genealogical (U-valued) Feller
diffusion and genealogical (U V -valued) super random walk is treated based on the present work in
[DG18b] and [GRG]. In the part II of this paper we go in a different direction and refine the study in
the case of continuum branching populations, give a refined analysis of the Laplace functional
and give a representation in terms of a Cox process on h-trees, rather than forests.
