A reconstruction theorem in terms of the topology and geometrical structures on the spaces of light
rays and skies of a given space-time is discussed. This result can be seen as part of Penrose and Low's
programme intending to describe the causal structure of a space-time $M$ in terms of the topological
and geometrical properties of the space of light rays, i.e., unparametrized time-oriented null
geodesics, $\mathcal{N}$. In the analysis of the reconstruction problem it becomes instrumental
the structure of the space of skies, i.e., of congruences of light rays. It will be shown that the space
of skies $\Sigma$ of a strongly causal skies distinguishing space-time $M$ carries a canonical
differentiable structure diffeomorphic to the original manifold $M$. Celestial curves, this
is, curves in $\mathcal{N}$ which are everywhere tangent to skies, play a fundamental role in the
analysis of the geometry of the space of light rays. It will be shown that a celestial curve is induced
by a past causal curve of events iff the legendrian isotopy defined by it is non-negative. This result
extends in a nontrivial way some recent results by Chernov \emph{et al} on Low's Legendrian conjecture.
Finally, it will be shown that a celestial causal map between the space of light rays of two strongly
causal spaces (provided that the target space is null non-conjugate) is necessarily induced from
a conformal immersion and conversely. These results make explicit the fundamental role played
by the collection of skies, a collection of legendrian spheres with respect to the canonical contact
structure on $\mathcal{N}$, in characterizing the causal structure of space-times.
