The grid theorem, originally proved by Robertson and Seymour in Graph Minors V in 1986, is one of the
most central results in the study of graph minors. It has found numerous applications in algorithmic
graph structure theory, for instance in bidimensionality theory, and it is the basis for several
other structure theorems developed in the graph minors project. In the mid-90s, Reed and Johnson,
Robertson, Seymour and Thomas (see [Reed 97, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas 01]), independently,
conjectured an analogous theorem for directed graphs, i.e. the existence of a function f : N ->
N such that every digraph of directed tree-width at least f(k) contains a directed grid of order k.
In an unpublished manuscript from 2001, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas give a proof of this
conjecture for planar digraphs. But for over a decade, this was the most general case proved for the
Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas conjecture. Only very recently, this result has been
extended to all classes of digraphs excluding a fixed undirected graph as a minor (see [Kawarabayashi,
Kreutzer 14]). In this paper, nearly two decades after the conjecture was made, we are finally able
to confirm the Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas conjecture in full generality and to
prove the directed grid theorem. As consequence of our results we are able to improve results in Reed
et al. in 1996 [Reed, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas 96] (see also [Open Problem Garden]) on disjoint
cycles of length at least l and in [Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, Kreutzer 14] on quarter-integral
disjoint paths. We expect many more algorithmic results to follow from the grid theorem.
