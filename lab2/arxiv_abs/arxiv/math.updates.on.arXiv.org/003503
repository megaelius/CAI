We study the question of when a $\{0,1\}$-valued threshold process associated to a mean zero Gaussian
or a symmetric stable vector corresponds to a divide and color (DC) process. This means that the process
corresponding to fixing a threshold level $h$ and letting a 1 correspond to the variable being larger
than $h$ arises from a random partition of the index set followed by coloring all elements in each
partition element 1 or 0 with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$, independently for different partition
elements. For example, the Ising model with zero external field (as well as a number of other well-known
processes) is a DC process where the random partition corresponds to the famous FK-random cluster
model. We first determine in general the exact lack of uniqueness of the representing random partition.
This amounts to determining the dimensions of the kernels of a certain family of linear operators.
We obtain various results in both the Gaussian and symmetric stable cases. For example, it turns
out that all discrete Gaussian free fields yield a DC process when the threshold is zero; this follows
quite easily from known facts. For general n-dimensional mean zero, variance one Gaussian vectors
with nonnegative covariances, the zero-threshold process is always a DC process for n=3 but this
is false for n=4. The answers in general are quite different depending on whether the threshold level
$h$ is zero or not. We show that there is no general monotonicity in $h$ in either direction. We also
show that all discrete Gaussian free fields yield DC processes for large thresholds. In the stable
case, among other results, if we stick to the simplest case of a permutation invariant, symmetric
stable vector with three variables, we obtain a phase transition in the stability exponent $\alpha$
at the surprising point 1/2.
