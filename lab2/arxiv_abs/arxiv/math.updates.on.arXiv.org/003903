The Internet of Things (IoT) will encompass a massive number of machine type devices that must wirelessly
transmit, in near real-time, a diverse set of messages sensed from their environment. Designing
resource allocation schemes to support such coexistent, heterogeneous communication is hence
a key IoT challenge. In particular, there is a need for self-organizing resource allocation solutions
that can account for unique IoT features, such as massive scale and stringent resource constraints.
In this paper, a novel finite memory multi-state sequential learning framework is proposed to enable
diverse IoT devices to share limited communication resources, while transmitting both delay-tolerant,
periodic messages and urgent, critical messages. The proposed learning framework enables the
IoT devices to learn the number of critical messages and to reallocate the communication resources
for the periodic messages to be used for the critical messages. Furthermore, the proposed learning
framework explicitly accounts for IoT device limitations in terms of memory and computational
capabilities. The convergence of the proposed learning framework is proved, and the lowest expected
delay that the IoT devices can achieve using this learning framework is derived. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm in IoT networks with different delay targets,
network densities, probabilities of detection, and memory sizes is analyzed in terms of the probability
of a successful random access request and percentage of devices that learned correctly. The results
show that the proposed learning algorithm is very effective in reducing the delay of urgent, critical
messages by intelligently reallocating the communication resources allocated to the delay-tolerant,
periodic messages.
