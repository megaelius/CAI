Notions of depth in regression have been introduced and studied in the literature. Regression depth
(RD) of Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999), the most famous, exemplifies a direct extension of Tukey location
depth (Tukey (1975)) to regression. The extension of another prevailing location depth, the projection
depth (Liu (1992), and Zuo and Serfling (2000)), to regression is called the projection regression
depth (PRD) (Zuo (2018a)(Z18a)). These two represent the most promising depth notions in regression
(Z18a). Carrizosa depth $D_C$ (Carrizosa (1996)) is another notion of depth in regression. The
most remarkable advantage of the notion of depth in regression is to introduce directly, the median-type
estimator, the maximum (or deepest) regression depth estimator (regression median) for regression
parameters in a multi-dimensional setting. The maximum (deepest) regression depth estimators
(regression medians) serve as robust alternatives to the classical least squares or least absolute
deviations estimator of the unknown parameters in a general linear regression model. The uniqueness
of regression medians is central in the discussion of the asymptotics of sample regression medians
and a desirable property for the convergence of approximate algorithm in the computation of sample
regression medians. Are the regression medians induced from RD, PRD, and $D_C$ unique? Answering
this question is the goal of this article. It is found that the regression median induced from PRD
possesses the uniqueness property, unlike its leading competitors. This and other findings on
the performance of PRD and its induced median indicate that the PRD and its induced median are highly
favorable among its leading competitors.
