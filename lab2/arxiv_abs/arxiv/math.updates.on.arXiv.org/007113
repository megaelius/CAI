Khintchine's theorem is a classical result from metric number theory which relates the Lebesgue
measure of certain limsup sets with the convergence/divergence of naturally occurring volume
sums. In this paper we ask whether an analogous result holds for iterated function systems (IFSs).
We say that an IFS is approximation regular if we observe Khintchine type behaviour, i.e., if the
size of certain limsup sets defined using the IFS is determined by the convergence/divergence of
naturally occurring sums. We prove that an IFS is approximation regular if it consists of conformal
mappings and satisfies the open set condition. The divergence condition we introduce incorporates
the inhomogeneity present within the IFS. We demonstrate via an example that such an approach is
essential. We also formulate an analogue of the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture and show that it holds
for a set of full Hausdorff dimension. Combining our results with the mass transference principle
of Beresnevich and Velani \cite{BerVel}, we prove a general result that implies the existence of
exceptional points within the attractor of our IFS. These points are exceptional in the sense that
they are "very well approximated". As a corollary of this result, we obtain a general solution to
a problem of Mahler, and prove that there are badly approximable numbers that are very well approximated
by quadratic irrationals. The ideas put forward in this paper are introduced in the general setting
of IFSs that may contain overlaps. We believe that by viewing IFS's from the perspective of metric
number theory, one can gain a greater insight into the extent to which they overlap. The results of
this paper should be interpreted as a first step in this investigation.
