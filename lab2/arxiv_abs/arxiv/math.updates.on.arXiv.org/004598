Higher chromatic numbers $\chi_s$ of simplicial complexes naturally generalize the chromatic
number $\chi_1$ of a graph. In any fixed dimension $d$, the $s$-chromatic number $\chi_s$ of $d$-complexes
can become arbitrarily large for $s\leq\lceil d/2\rceil$ [6,18]. In contrast, $\chi_{d+1}=1$,
and only little is known on $\chi_s$ for $\lceil d/2\rceil<s\leq d$. A particular class of $d$-complexes
are triangulations of $d$-manifolds. As a consequence of the Map Color Theorem for surfaces [29],
the 2-chromatic number of any fixed surface is finite. However, by combining results from the literature,
we will see that $\chi_2$ for surfaces becomes arbitrarily large with growing genus. The proof for
this is via Steiner triple systems and is non-constructive. In particular, up to now, no explicit
triangulations of surfaces with high $\chi_2$ were known. We show that orientable surfaces of genus
at least 20 and non-orientable surfaces of genus at least 26 have a 2-chromatic number of at least
4. Via a projective Steiner triple systems, we construct an explicit triangulation of a non-orientable
surface of genus 2542 and with face vector $f=(127,8001,5334)$ that has 2-chromatic number 5 or
6. We also give orientable examples with 2-chromatic numbers 5 and 6. For 3-dimensional manifolds,
an iterated moment curve construction [18] along with embedding results [6] can be used to produce
triangulations with arbitrarily large 2-chromatic number, but of tremendous size. Via a topological
version of the geometric construction of [18], we obtain a rather small triangulation of the 3-dimensional
sphere $S^3$ with face vector $f=(167,1579,2824,1412)$ and 2-chromatic number 5.
