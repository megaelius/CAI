Randomization ensures that observed and unobserved covariates are balanced, on average. However,
randomizing units to treatment and control often leads to covariate imbalances in realization,
and such imbalances can inflate the variance of estimators of the treatment effect. One solution
to this problem is rerandomization---an experimental design strategy that randomizes units until
some balance criterion is fulfilled---which yields more precise estimators of the treatment effect
if covariates are correlated with the outcome. Most rerandomization schemes in the literature
utilize the Mahalanobis distance, which may not be preferable when covariates are correlated or
vary in importance. As an alternative, we introduce an experimental design strategy called ridge
rerandomization, which utilizes a modified Mahalanobis distance that addresses collinearities
among covariates and automatically places a hierarchy of importance on the covariates according
to their eigenstructure. This modified Mahalanobis distance has connections to principal components
and the Euclidean distance, and---to our knowledge---has remained unexplored. We establish several
theoretical properties of this modified Mahalanobis distance and our ridge rerandomization scheme.
These results guarantee that ridge rerandomization is preferable over randomization and suggest
when ridge rerandomization is preferable over standard rerandomization schemes. We also provide
simulation evidence that suggests that ridge rerandomization is particularly preferable over
typical rerandomization schemes in high-dimensional or high-collinearity settings.
