In this paper, we are concerned with the fractional and higher order H\'{e}non-Hardy equations
\begin{equation*} (-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}u(x)=|x|^{a}u^{p}(x) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
\text{in} \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^{n} \,\,\, \text{or} \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^{n}_{+} \end{equation*}
with $n\geq2$, $0<\alpha<2$ or $\alpha=2m$ with $1\leq m<\frac{n}{2}$, $-\alpha<a<+\infty$
and $0<p<\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$. By developing a method of scaling spheres, we prove
Liouville theorems for nonnegative solutions to the above H\'{e}non-Hardy equations in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
When $a>0$, our results extend the known Liouville type theorems for $1<p<\frac{n+\alpha+a}{n-\alpha}$
to the full range $0<p<\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$. In particular, when $m=1$, our results
give a complete and affirmative answer to the conjecture posed by Phan and Souplet \cite{PS}. As
other applications of the method of scaling spheres, we establish the Liouville theorem for fractional
order and second order H\'{e}non-Hardy equations with Dirichlet conditions on $\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$
for all $1\leq p<\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$, and Liouville theorem for higher order Lane-Emden
equations (i.e., $\alpha=2m$ and $a=0$) with Navier conditions on $\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$ for all
$1<p\leq\frac{n+2m}{n-2m}$. Then as an application, we derive a priori estimates and existence
of positive solutions to higher order Lane-Emden equations in bounded domains for all $1<p<\frac{n+2m}{n-2m}$.
Our theorems extend the results in Chen, Fang and Li \cite{CFL} and Dai, Peng and Qin \cite{DPQ} to
the maximal range of $p$. For bounded domains, we apply the method of scaling spheres to derive Liouville
theorems for super-critical problems. We believe the method of scaling spheres can be applied to
various problems without translation invariance or in the cases Kelvin transforms in conjunction
with the method of moving planes do not work.
