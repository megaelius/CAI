We consider a second-order elliptic boundary value problem with strongly monotone and Lipschitz-continuous
nonlinearity. We design and study its adaptive numerical approximation interconnecting a finite
element discretization, the Banach-Picard linearization, and a contractive linear algebraic
solver. We in particular identify stopping criteria for the algebraic solver that on the one hand
do not request an overly tight tolerance but on the other hand are sufficient for the inexact (perturbed)
Banach-Picard linearization to remain contractive. Similarly, we identify suitable stopping
criteria for the Banach-Picard iteration that leave an amount of linearization error that is not
harmful for the residual a-posteriori error estimate to steer reliably the adaptive mesh-refinement.
For the resulting algorithm, we prove a contraction of the (doubly) inexact iterates after some
amount of steps of mesh-refinement / linerization / algebraic solver, leading to its linear convergence.
Moreover, for usual mesh-refinement rules, we also prove that the overall error decays at the optimal
rate with respect to the number of elements (degrees of freedom) added with respect to the initial
mesh. Finally, we prove that our fully adaptive algorithm drives the overall error down with the
same optimal rate also with respect to the overall algorithmic cost expressed as the cumulated sum
of the number of mesh elements over all mesh-refinement, linearization, and algebraic solver steps.
Numerical experiments support these theoretical findings and illustrate the optimal overall
algorithmic cost of the fully adaptive algorithm on several test cases.
