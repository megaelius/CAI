Let $X$ be an irreducible complex projective variety. Tropical geometry and the theory of Newton-Okounkov
bodies are two methods which can produce toric degenerations of $X$, and in 2016, Kaveh and Manon
showed that the two are related. Specifically, they showed that a toric degeneration corresponding
to a maximal-dimensional prime cone in the tropicalization of $X$, with central fiber $X_0$, can
also be realized as one associated to a certain full-rank valuation (with one-dimensional leaves),
with Newton-Okounkov body equal to the polytope of $X_0$. The first main result of this paper gives
two explicit geometric maps between the Newton-Okounkov bodies corresponding to two maximal-dimensional
prime cones in the tropicalization of $X$ which are adjacent, i.e., share a codimension-1 facet.
The two maps, the ``shift'' and the ``flip'' maps, have desirable properties: for example, they
act as the identity along the shared codimension-1 facet in a suitable sense. We call this a ``wall-crossing
phenomenon for Newton-Okounkov bodies''. The second set of results of this paper deals with an ``algebraic''
wall-crossing map. First, under a technical condition, we produce a natural ``algebraic wall-crossing''
map on the underlying value semigroups (of the corresponding valuations). We then produce an example
showing that this algebraic wall-crossing need not arise as the restriction of either of the geometric
wall-crossing maps. Finally, in the case of the tropical Grassmannian of 2-planes in $\mathbb{C}^m$,
we prove that the algebraic wall-crossing map is the restriction of the geometric ``flip'' map.
In an Appendix by Nathan Ilten, he explains how the geometric wall-crossing phenomenon can also
be derived from the perspective of complexity-one $T$-varieties; Ilten also explains the connection
to the ``combinatorial mutations'' studied by Akhtar, Coates, Galkin, and Kasprzyk.
