The melting temperature of polymer powder shows regular odd-even dependence on the length of polymer.
We found the melting temperature of a two dimensional mathematical dimer film also depends on the
odd-eveness of the finite width of dimer film. A weak external bond between dimers is introduced
into the classical dimer model in this dimer film. We proposed a mathematical physics model for computing
the melting temperature of a dimer film covering a finite square lattice. The melting temperature
increase of dimer film from a width of N(N is even number)to N+1 is always bigger than that from a width
of N+1 to N+2. The entropy increase from a width of N(N is even)to N+1 is negative, while entropy increase
from a width of N+1 to N+2 is positive. This odd-even effect of dimer covering on finite area exist
both on rectangle and torus. We derived the equation of melting temperature by extending this finite
size system to thermodynamic limit. The melting temperature is proportional to the external bonding
energy that we assumes it binds neighboring dimers and proportional to the inverse of entropy per
site. More over, fusing two small rectangular dimer film with odd number of length into one big rectangular
film gains more entropy than fusing two small rectangles with even number of length into the same
big rectangle. Fusing two small toruses with even number of length into one big torus reduces entropy.
Fusing two small toruses with odd number of length increases the entropy. Thus two dimer films with
even number of length repel each other, two dimer films with odd length attract each other. The odd-even
effect is also reflected on the correlation function of two topologically distinguishable loops
in a torus surface. The entropy of finite system dominates odd-even effect. This model has straight
extension to longer polymers.
