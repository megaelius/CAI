Everything that is detected or measured is the direct result of something influencing something
else. This is the essence of the concept of force, which has become central to physics. By considering
both the act of influencing and the response to such influence as a pair of events, we can describe
a universe of interactions as a partially-ordered set of events. In this paper, we take the partially-ordered
set of events as a fundamental picture of influence and aim to determine what interesting physics
can be recovered. This is accomplished by identifying a means by which events in a partially-ordered
set can be aptly and consistently quantified. Since, in general, a partially-ordered set lacks
symmetries to constraint any quantification, we propose to distinguish a chain of events, which
represents an observer, and quantify some subset of events with respect to the observer chain. We
demonstrate that consistent quantification with respect to pairs of observer chains exhibiting
a constant relationship with one another results in a metric analogous to the Minkowski metric and
that transformation of the quantification with respect to one pair of chains to quantification
with respect to another pair of chains results in the Bondi k-calculus, which represents a Lorentz
transformation under a simple change of variables. We further demonstrate that chain projection
induces geometric structure in the partially-ordered set, which itself is inherently both non-geometric
and non-dimensional. Collectively, these results suggest that the concept of space-time geometry
may emerge as a unique way for an embedded observer to aptly and consistently quantify a partially-ordered
set of events. In addition to having potential implications for space-time physics, this also may
serve as a foundation for understanding analogous space-time in condensed matter systems.
