Learning optimal resource allocation policies in wireless systems can be effectively achieved
by formulating finite dimensional constrained programs which depend on system configuration,
as well as the adopted learning parameterization. The interest here is in cases where system models
are unavailable, prompting methods that probe the wireless system with candidate policies, and
then use observed performance to determine better policies. This generic procedure is difficult
because of the need to cull accurate gradient estimates out of these limited system queries. This
paper constructs and exploits smoothed surrogates of constrained ergodic resource allocation
problems, the gradients of the former being representable exactly as averages of finite differences
that can be obtained through limited system probing. Leveraging this unique property, we develop
a new model-free primal-dual algorithm for learning optimal ergodic resource allocations, while
we rigorously analyze the relationships between original policy search problems and their surrogates,
in both primal and dual domains. First, we show that both primal and dual domain surrogates are uniformly
consistent approximations of their corresponding original finite dimensional counterparts.
Upon further assuming the use of near-universal policy parameterizations, we also develop explicit
bounds on the gap between optimal values of initial, infinite dimensional resource allocation
problems, and dual values of their parameterized smoothed surrogates. In fact, we show that this
duality gap decreases at a linear rate relative to smoothing and universality parameters. Thus,
it can be made arbitrarily small at will, also justifying our proposed primal-dual algorithmic
recipe. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
