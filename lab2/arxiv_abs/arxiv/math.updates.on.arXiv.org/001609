This paper studies the evolution of self-appraisal and social power, for a group of individuals
who discuss and form opinions. We consider a modification of the recently proposed DeGroot-Friedkin
(DF) model, in which the opinion formation process takes place on the same timescale as the reflected
appraisal process; we call this new model the single-timescale DF model. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the equilibria and convergence properties of the model for the settings of irreducible
and reducible influence networks. For the setting of irreducible influence networks, the single-timescale
DF model has the same behavior as the original DF model, that is, it predicts among other things that
the social power ranking among individuals is asymptotically equal to their centrality ranking,
that social power tends to accumulate at the top of the centrality ranking hierarchy, and that an
autocratic (resp., democratic) power structure arises when the centrality scores are maximally
nonuniform (resp., uniform). For the setting of reducible influence networks, the single-timescale
DF model behaves differently from the original DF model in two ways. First, an individual, who corresponds
to a reducible node in a reducible influence network, can keep all social power in the single-timescale
DF model if the initial condition does so, whereas its social power asymptotically vanishes in the
original DF model. Second, when the associated network has multiple sinks, the two models behave
very differently: the original DF model has a single globally-attractive equilibrium, whereas
any partition of social power among the sinks is allowable at equilibrium in the single-timescale
DF model.
