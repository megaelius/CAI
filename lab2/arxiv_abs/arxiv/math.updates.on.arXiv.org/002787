We utilize the externally forced linearized Navier-Stokes equations to study the receptivity
of pre-transitional boundary layers to persistent stochastic excitation sources. Stochastic
forcing is used to model the effect of free-stream turbulence that enters at various wall-normal
locations and the fluctuation dynamics are studied via linearized models that arise from locally
parallel and global perspectives. In contrast to the widely used resolvent analysis that quantifies
amplification mechanisms surrounding input-output pairs of identical temporal frequency, our
approach pursues the steady-state response to white-in-time stochastic excitation. In addition
to stochastic forcing with trivial (identity) covariance, we utilize the spatial spectrum of homogeneous
isotropic turbulence to model the effect of free-stream turbulence. Even though models that are
based on the parallel flow assumption do not account for the effect of the spatially evolving base
flow, we demonstrate that they capture important trends and prevailing length-scales in stochastically
forced boundary layer flows. On the other hand, the global flow analysis, which accounts for the
spatially evolving nature of the boundary layer flow, predicts the amplification of a cascade of
streamwise scales throughout the streamwise domain. We show that the flow structures that can be
extracted from a modal decomposition of the resulting velocity covariance matrix, can be closely
captured by a carefully conducted parallel flow analysis at various streamwise locations and over
individual length-scales. Our study provides insight into the interaction of the slowly varying
base flow with streamwise streaks and TS waves, and it offers a systematic, computationally efficient
framework for quantifying the influence of free-stream turbulence on the dynamics of velocity
fluctuations in weakly non-parallel flows.
