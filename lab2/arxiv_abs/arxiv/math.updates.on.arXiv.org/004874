Though much work has been done with respect to the existence of extremals of the critical first order
Trudinger-Moser inequalities in $W^{1,n}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and higher order Adams inequalities
on finite domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, whether there exists an extremal function for
the critical higher order Adams inequalities on the entire space $\mathbb{R}^n$ still remains
open. The current paper represents the first attempt in this direction. The classical blow-up procedure
cannot apply to solving the existence of critical Adams type inequality because of the absence of
the P\'{o}lya-Szeg\"{o}\ type inequality. In this paper, we develop some new ideas and approaches
based on a sharp Fourier rearrangement principle (see \cite{Lenzmann}), sharp constants of the
higher-order Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities and optimal poly-harmonic truncations to study
the existence and nonexistence of the maximizers for the Adams inequalities in $\mathbb{R}^4$
of the form $$ S(\alpha)=\sup_{\|u\|_{H^2}=1}\int_{\mathbb{R}^4}\big(\exp(32\pi^2|u|^2)-1-\alpha|u|^2\big)dx,$$
where $\alpha \in (-\infty, 32\pi^2)$. We establish the existence of the threshold $\alpha^{\ast}$,
where $\alpha^{\ast}\geq \frac{(32\pi^{2})^2B_{2}}{2}$ and $B_2\geq \frac{1}{24\pi^2}$,
such that $S\left( \alpha\right) $ is attained if $32\pi^{2}-\alpha<\alpha^{\ast}$, and is not
attained if $32\pi^{2}-\alpha>\alpha^{\ast}$. This phenomena has not been observed before even
in the case of first order Trudinger-Moser inequality. Therefore, we also establish the existence
and non-existence of an extremal function for the Trudinger-Moser inequality on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Furthermore, the symmetry of the extremal functions can also be deduced through the Fourier rearrangement
principle.
