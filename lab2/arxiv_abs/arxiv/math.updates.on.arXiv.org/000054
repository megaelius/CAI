We consider a semilinear elliptic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a smooth, possibly
unbounded, domain. Under suitable assumptions, we deduce a condition on the size of the domain that
implies the existence of a positive solution satisfying a uniform pointwise estimate. Here, uniform
means that the estimate is independent of the domain. The main advantage of our approach is that it
allows us to remove a restrictive monotonicity assumption that was imposed in the recent paper.
In addition, we can remove a non-degeneracy condition that was assumed in the latter reference.
Furthermore, we can generalize an old result, concerning semilinear elliptic nonlinear eigenvalue
problems. Moreover, we study the boundary layer of global minimizers of the corresponding singular
perturbation problem. For the above applications, our approach is based on a refinement of a useful
result, concerning the behavior of global minimizers of the associated energy over large balls,
subject to Dirichlet conditions. Combining this refinement with global bifurcation theory and
the celebrated sliding method, we can prove uniform estimates for solutions away from their nodal
set. In particular, combining our approach with a-priori estimates that we obtain by blow-up, a
doubling lemma, and known Liouville type theorems, we can give a new proof of a known Liouville type
theorem without using boundary blow-up solutions. We can also provide an alternative proof, and
a useful extension, of a Liouville theorem, involving the presence of an obstacle. Making use of
the latter extension, we consider the singular perturbation problem with mixed boundary conditions.
Moreover, we prove some new one-dimensional symmetry properties of certain entire solutions to
Allen-Cahn type equations, as well as in half spaces, convex cylindrical domains and epigraphs.
