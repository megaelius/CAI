Conformal prediction methods construct prediction regions for iid data that are valid in finite
samples. We provide two parametric conformal prediction regions that are applicable for a wide
class of continuous statistical models. This class of statistical models includes generalized
linear models (GLMs) with continuous outcomes. Our parametric conformal prediction regions possesses
finite sample validity, even when the model is misspecified, and are asymptotically of minimal
length when the model is correctly specified. The first parametric conformal prediction region
is constructed through binning of the predictor space, guarantees finite-sample local validity
and is asymptotically minimal at the $\sqrt{\log(n)/n}$ rate when the dimension $d$ of the predictor
space is one or two, and converges at the $O\{(\log(n)/n)^{1/d}\}$ rate when $d > 2$. The second parametric
conformal prediction region is constructed by transforming the outcome variable to a common distribution
via the probability integral transform, guarantees finite-sample marginal validity, and is asymptotically
minimal at the $\sqrt{\log(n)/n}$ rate. We develop a novel concentration inequality for maximum
likelihood estimation that induces these convergence rates. We analyze prediction region coverage
properties, large-sample efficiency, and robustness properties of four methods for constructing
conformal prediction intervals for GLMs: fully nonparametric kernel-based conformal, residual
based conformal, normalized residual based conformal, and parametric conformal which uses the
assumed GLM density as a conformity measure. Extensive simulations compare these approaches to
standard asymptotic prediction regions. The utility of the parametric conformal prediction region
is demonstrated in an application to interval prediction of glycosylated hemoglobin levels, a
blood measurement used to diagnose diabetes.
