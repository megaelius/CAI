The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) provides a framework for simulating multiscale transport
with the updates of both gas distribution function and macroscopic flow variables on the cell size
and time step scales. The multiscale dynamics in UGKS is achieved through the coupled particle transport
and collision in the particle evolution process within a time step. In this paper, under the UGKS
framework, we propose an efficient multiscale unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method.
The gas dynamics in UGKWP method is described by the individual particle movement coupled with the
evolution of the probability density function (PDF). During a time step, the trajectories of simulation
particles are tracked until collision happens, and the post-collision particles are evolved collectively
through the evolution of the corresponding distribution function. The evolution of simulation
particles and distribution function is guided by evolution of macroscopic variables. The two descriptions
on a gas particle, i.e. wave and particle, switch dynamically with time. A new concept of multiscale
multi-efficiency preserving (MMP) method is introduced, and the UGKWP method is shown to be an MMP
scheme. The UGKWP method is specially efficient for hypersonic flow simulation in all regimes in
comparison with the wave-type discrete ordinate methods, and presents a much lower stochastic
noise in the continuum flow regime in comparison with the particle-based Monte Carlo methods. Numerical
tests for flows over a wide range of Mach and Knudsen numbers are presented. The examples include
mainly the hypersonic flow passing a circular cylinder at Mach numbers $20$ and $30$ and Knudsen
numbers $1$ and $10^{-4}$, low speed lid-driven cavity flow, and laminar boundary layer. These
results validate the accuracy, efficiency, and multiscale property of UGKWP method.
