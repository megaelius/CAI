In this work, we consider the discretization of nonlinear hyperbolic systems in nonconservative
form with the high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) based on collocation
of quadrature and interpolation points (Kopriva and Gassner, J. Sci. Comput., 44 (2010), pp.136--155;
Carpenter et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 36 (2014), pp.~B835-B867). We present a general framework
for the design of such schemes that satisfy a semi-discrete entropy inequality for a given convex
entropy function at any approximation order. The framework is closely related to the one introduced
for conservation laws by Chen and Shu (J. Comput. Phys., 345 (2017), pp.~427--461) and relies on
the modification of the integral over discretization elements where we replace the physical fluxes
by entropy conservative numerical fluxes from Castro et al. (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013), pp.~1371--1391),
while entropy stable numerical fluxes are used at element interfaces. Time discretization is performed
with strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta schemes. We use this framework for the discretization
of two systems in one space-dimension: a $2\times2$ system with a nonconservative product associated
to a linearly-degenerate field for which the DGSEM fails to capture the physically relevant solution,
and the isentropic Baer-Nunziato model. For the latter, we derive conditions on the numerical parameters
of the discrete scheme to further keep positivity of the partial densities and a maximum principle
on the void fractions. Numerical experiments support the conclusions of the present analysis and
highlight stability and robustness of the present schemes.
