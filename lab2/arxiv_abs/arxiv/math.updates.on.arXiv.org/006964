We consider last passage percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ with general weight distributions, which
is expected to be a member of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In this model, an
oriented path between given endpoints which maximizes the sum of the i.i.d. weight variables associated
to its vertices is called a geodesic. Under natural conditions of curvature of the limiting geodesic
weight profile and stretched exponential decay of both tails of the point-to-point weight, we use
geometric arguments to upgrade the assumptions to prove optimal upper and lower tail behavior with
the exponents of $3/2$ and $3$ for the weight of the geodesic from $(1,1)$ to $(r,r)$ for all large
finite $r$. The proofs merge several ideas, including the well known super-additivity property
of last passage values, concentration of measure behavior for sums of stretched exponential random
variables, and geometric insights coming from the study of geodesics and more general objects called
geodesic watermelons. Previously such optimal behavior was only known for exactly solvable models,
with proofs relying on hard analysis of formulas from integrable probability, which are unavailable
in the general setting. Our results illustrate a facet of universality in a class of KPZ stochastic
growth models and provide a geometric explanation of the upper and lower tail exponents of the GUE
Tracy-Widom distribution, the conjectured one point scaling limit of such models. The key arguments
are based on an observation of general interest that super-additivity allows a natural iterative
bootstrapping procedure to obtain improved tail estimates.
