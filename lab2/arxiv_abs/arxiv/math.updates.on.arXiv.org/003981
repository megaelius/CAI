By deploying machine-learning algorithms at the network edge, edge learning can leverage the enormous
real-time data generated by billions of mobile devices to train AI models, which enable intelligent
mobile applications. In this emerging research area, one key direction is to efficiently utilize
radio resources for wireless data acquisition to minimize the latency of executing a learning task
at an edge server. Along this direction, we consider the specific problem of retransmission decision
in each communication round to ensure both reliability and quantity of those training data for accelerating
model convergence. To solve the problem, a new retransmission protocol called data-importance
aware automatic-repeat-request (importance ARQ) is proposed. Unlike the classic ARQ focusing
merely on reliability, importance ARQ selectively retransmits a data sample based on its uncertainty
which helps learning and can be measured using the model under training. Underpinning the proposed
protocol is a derived elegant communication-learning relation between two corresponding metrics,
i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data uncertainty. This relation facilitates the design
of a simple threshold based policy for importance ARQ. The policy is first derived based on the classic
classifier model of support vector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a data sample is measured
by its distance to the decision boundary. The policy is then extended to the more complex model of
convolutional neural networks (CNN) where data uncertainty is measured by entropy. Extensive
experiments have been conducted for both the SVM and CNN using real datasets with balanced and imbalanced
distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that importance ARQ effectively copes with
channel fading and noise in wireless data acquisition to achieve faster model convergence than
the conventional channel-aware ARQ.
