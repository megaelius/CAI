We prove that if the Ricci curvature of a geodesically complete Riemannian manifold $X$, endowed
with the Riemannian distance $\rho$ and the Riemannian volume measure $\mathfrak{m}$, is bounded
from below by a Dynkin decomposable function $k\colon X\to\mathbb{R}$, then $X$ is stochastically
complete. This assumption on $k$ is satisfied if its negative part $k^-$ belongs to the Kato class
of $X$. In addition, given $f\in L^p(X)$ for sufficiently large $p$ in a range depending only on $k^-$,
we derive a global Bismut derivative formula for $\nabla \mathsf{P}_tf$ for every $t>0$ along the
heat flow $(\mathsf{P}_t)_{t\geq 0}$, whose $L^\infty$-$\mathrm{Lip}$-regularization we
obtain as a corollary. Moreover, for such functions $k$, we show that the Ricci curvature of $X$ is
bounded from below by $k$ if and only if $X$ supports the $L^1$-gradient estimate w.r.t. $k$, i.e.
for every $f\in W^{1,2}(X)$ and $t\geq 0$, $$ \vert \nabla \mathsf{P}_t f\vert\leq \mathsf{P}_t^k\vert\nabla
f\vert $$ holds $\mathfrak{m}$-a.e., $(\mathsf{P}_t^k)_{t\geq 0}$ being the Schr\"odinger
semigroup in $L^2(X)$ generated by $-(\Delta-k)/2$. If $k$ is additionally lower semicontinuous,
another equivalent characterization of lower Ricci bounds by $k$ is proven to be the existence,
given any $x,y\in X$, of a Markovian coupling $(\mathsf{b}^x,\mathsf{b}^y)$ of Brownian motions
on $M$ starting in $(x,y)$ such that a.s. for every $s,t\in [0,\infty)$ with $s\leq t$, one has the
pathwise estimate $$ \rho\big(\mathsf{b}_t^x,\mathsf{b}_t^y\big) \leq \mathrm{e}^{-\int_s^t
\underline{k}\left(\mathsf{b}_r^x,\mathsf{b}_r^y\right)/2\,\mathrm{d} r}\rho\big(\mathsf{b}_s^x,\mathsf{b}_s^y\big)
$$ involving the ''average'' $\underline{k}(u,v) := \inf_\gamma \int_0^1 k(\gamma_r)\,\mathrm{d}
r$ of the function $k$ along all minimizing geodesics $\gamma\colon [0,1]\to X$ from $u$ to $v$.
