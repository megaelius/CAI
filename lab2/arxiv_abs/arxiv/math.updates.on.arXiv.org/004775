In this article we show that the new BPS equations for vortices, with nonzero diagonal components
of the stress tensor, obtained in \cite{Atmaja:2015lia} for the generalized Maxwell-Higgs model
can also be derived using the BPS Lagrangian method developed in \cite{Atmaja:2015umo}. We add
into the original BPS Lagrangian $L_{BPS}=\int dQ$, which is a total derivative term, two additional
terms that are proportional to square of the first-derivative of scalar effective field, $f'(r)^2$,
and to a function that depends only on the scalar effective field. These additional terms produce
additional constraint equations coming from Euler-Lagrange equations of the BPS Lagrangian.
We apply this procedure for the generalized Born-Infeld-Higgs model and show that the total static
energy, for the corresponding BPS equations, is finite if the scalar potential $V< 2b^2$, with $b$
is the Born-Infeld parameter. We also compute the energy-momentum tensor and show that its diagonal
spatial components in radial and angular directions are nonzero. Furthermore we show that the conservation
of energy-momentum does not produce new constraint equation. We do the numerical analysis and found
that for a large class of solutions the scalar and gauge effective fields, $f(r)$ and $a(r)$, behave
nicely near the origin, but unfortunately they are infinite near the boundary. We suggest that incorporate
gravity into the action might resolve this problem and other resolution is by considering BPS vortex
in higher dimensional models. We also suggest that the BPS Lagrangian method could be used to find
BPS equations for other solitons with nonzero stress tensor.
