Exact recovery of $K$-sparse signals $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ from linear measurements $y=Ax$,
where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix, arises from many applications. The orthogonal
matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is widely used for reconstructing $x$. A fundamental question
in the performance analysis of OMP is the characterizations of the probability of exact recovery
of $x$ for random matrix $A$ and the minimal $m$ to guarantee a target recovery performance. In many
practical applications, in addition to sparsity, $x$ also has some additional properties. This
paper shows that these properties can be used to refine the answer to the above question. In this paper,
we first show that the prior information of the nonzero entries of $x$ can be used to provide an upper
bound on $\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2$. Then, we use this upper bound to develop a lower bound on the probability
of exact recovery of $x$ using OMP in $K$ iterations. Furthermore, we develop a lower bound on the
number of measurements $m$ to guarantee that the exact recovery probability using $K$ iterations
of OMP is no smaller than a given target probability. Finally, we show that when $K=O(\sqrt{\ln n})$,
as both $n$ and $K$ go to infinity, for any $0<\zeta\leq 1/\sqrt{\pi}$, $m=2K\ln (n/\zeta)$ measurements
are sufficient to ensure that the probability of exact recovering any $K$-sparse $x$ is no lower
than $1-\zeta$ with $K$ iterations of OMP. For $K$-sparse $\alpha$-strongly decaying signals
and for $K$-sparse $x$ whose nonzero entries independently and identically follow the Gaussian
distribution, the number of measurements sufficient for exact recovery with probability no lower
than $1-\zeta$ reduces further to $m=(\sqrt{K}+4\sqrt{\frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha-1}\ln(n/\zeta)})^2$
and asymptotically $m\approx 1.9K\ln (n/\zeta)$, respectively.
