We investigate the behavior of the sum and difference sets of $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$
chosen independently and randomly according to a binomial parameter $p(n) = o(1)$. We show that
for rapidly decaying $p(n)$, $A$ is almost surely difference-dominated as $n \to \infty$, but for
slowly decaying $p(n)$, $A$ is almost surely balanced as $n \to \infty$, with a continuous phase
transition as $p(n)$ crosses a critical threshold. Specifically, we show that if $p(n) = o(n^{-1/2})$,
then $|A-A|/|A+A|$ converges to $2$ almost surely as $n \to \infty$ and if $p(n) = c \cdot n^{-1/2}$,
then $|A-A|/|A+A|$ converges to $1+\exp(-c^2/2)$ almost surely as $n \to \infty$. In these cases,
we modify the arguments of Hegarty and Miller on subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ to prove our results. When
$\sqrt{\log n} \cdot n^{-1/2} = o(p(n))$, we prove that $|A-A| = |A+A| = n$ almost surely as $n \to
\infty$ if some additional restrictions are placed on $n$. In this case, the behavior is drastically
different from that of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ and new technical issues arise, so a novel approach
is needed. When $n^{-1/2} = o(p(n))$ and $p(n) = o(\sqrt{ \log n} \cdot n^{-1/2})$, the behavior
of $|A+A|$ and $|A-A|$ is markedly different and suggests an avenue for further study. These results
establish a "correspondence principle" with the existing results of Hegarty, Miller, and Vissuet.
As $p(n)$ decays more rapidly, the behavior of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ approaches
the behavior of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ shown by Hegarty and Miller. Moreover, as $p(n)$ decays
more slowly, the behavior of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ approaches the behavior shown
by Miller and Vissuet in the case where $p(n) = 1/2$.
