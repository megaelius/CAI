A variety of methods is available to quantify uncertainties arising with\-in the modeling of flow
and transport in carbon dioxide storage, but there is a lack of thorough comparisons. Usually, raw
data from such storage sites can hardly be described by theoretical statistical distributions
since only very limited data is available. Hence, exact information on distribution shapes for
all uncertain parameters is very rare in realistic applications. We discuss and compare four different
methods tested for data-driven uncertainty quantification based on a benchmark scenario of carbon
dioxide storage. In the benchmark, for which we provide data and code, carbon dioxide is injected
into a saline aquifer modeled by the nonlinear capillarity-free fractional flow formulation for
two incompressible fluid phases, namely carbon dioxide and brine. To cover different aspects of
uncertainty quantification, we incorporate various sources of uncertainty such as uncertainty
of boundary conditions, of conceptual model definitions and of material properties. We consider
recent versions of the following non-intrusive and intrusive uncertainty quantification methods:
arbitary polynomial chaos, spatially adaptive sparse grids, kernel-based greedy interpolation
and hybrid stochastic Galerkin. The performance of each approach is demonstrated assessing expectation
value and standard deviation of the carbon dioxide saturation against a reference statistic based
on Monte Carlo sampling. We compare the convergence of all methods reporting on accuracy with respect
to the number of model runs and resolution. Finally we offer suggestions about the methods' advantages
and disadvantages that can guide the modeler for uncertainty quantification in carbon dioxide
storage and beyond.
