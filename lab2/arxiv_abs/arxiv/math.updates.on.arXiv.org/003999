In this paper we present mutual coinduction as a dual of mutual induction and also as a generalization
of standard coinduction. In particular, we present a precise formal definition of mutual induction
and mutual coinduction. In the process we present the associated mutual induction and mutual coinduction
proof principles, and we present the conditions under which these principles hold. In spite of some
mention of mutual (co)induction in research literature, but the formal definition of mutual (co)induction
and the proof of the mutual (co)induction proof principles we present here seem to be the first such
definition and proof. As such, to the best of our knowledge, it seems our work is the first to point
out that, unlike the case for standard (co)induction, monotonicity of generators is not sufficient
for guaranteeing the existence of least and greatest simultaneous fixed points in complete lattices,
and that continuity on the other hand is sufficient for guaranteeing their existence. In the course
of our presentation of mutual coinduction we also discuss some concepts related to standard (also
called direct) induction and standard coinduction, as well as ones related to mutual (also called
simultaneous or indirect) induction. During the presentation we purposely discuss particular
standard concepts so as to help motivate the definitions of their more general counterparts for
mutual/ simultaneous/ indirect (co)induction. Greatest simultaneous post-fixed points, in
particular, will be abstractions and models of mathematical objects (e.g., points, sets, types,
predicates, etc.) that are defined mutually-coinductively.
