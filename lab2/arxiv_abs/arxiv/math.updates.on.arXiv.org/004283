A novel surface interrogation technique is proposed to compute the intersection of curves with
spline surfaces in isogeometric analysis. The intersection points are determined in one-shot
without resorting to a Newton-Raphson iteration or successive refinement. Surface-curve intersection
is required in a wide range of applications, including contact, immersed boundary methods and lattice-skin
structures, and requires usually the solution of a system of nonlinear equations. It is assumed
that the surface is given in form of a spline, such as a NURBS, T-spline or Catmull-Clark subdivision
surface, and is convertible into a collection of B\'ezier patches. First, a hierarchical bounding
volume tree is used to efficiently identify the B\'ezier patches with a convex-hull intersecting
the convex-hull of a given curve segment. For ease of implementation convex-hulls are approximated
with k-dops (discrete orientation polytopes). Subsequently, the intersections of the identified
B\'ezier patches with the curve segment are determined with a matrix-based implicit representation
leading to the computation of a sequence of small singular value decompositions (SVDs). As an application
of the developed interrogation technique the isogeometric design and analysis of lattice-skin
structures is investigated. The skin is a spline surface that is usually created in a computer-aided
design (CAD) system and the periodic lattice to be fitted consists of unit cells, each containing
a small number of struts. The lattice-skin structure is generated by projecting selected lattice
nodes onto the surface after determining the intersection of unit cell edges with the surface. For
mechanical analysis, the skin is modelled as a Kirchhoff-Love thin-shell and the lattice as a pin-jointed
truss. The two types of structures are coupled with a standard Lagrange multiplier approach.
