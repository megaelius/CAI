This paper concerns a Fokker-Planck equation on the positive real line modeling nucleation and
growth of clusters. The main feature of the equation is the dependence of the driving vector field
and boundary condition on a non-local order parameter related to the excess mass of the system. The
first main result concerns the well-posedness and regularity of the Cauchy problem. The well-posedness
is based on a fixed point argument, and the regularity on Schauder estimates. The first a priori estimates
yield H\"older regularity of the non-local order parameter, which is improved by an iteration argument.
The asymptotic behavior of solutions depends on some order parameter $\rho$ depending on the initial
data. The system shows different behavior depending on a value $\rho_s>0$, determined from the
potentials and diffusion coefficient. For $\rho \leq \rho_s$, there exists an equilibrium solution
$c^{\text{eq}}_{(\rho)}$. If $\rho\le\rho_s$ the solution converges strongly to $c^{\text{eq}}_{(\rho)}$,
while if $\rho > \rho_s$ the solution converges weakly to $c^{\text{eq}}_{(\rho_s)}$. The excess
$\rho - \rho_s$ gets lost due to the formation of larger and larger clusters. In this regard, the model
behaves similarly to the classical Becker-D\"oring equation. The system possesses a free energy,
strictly decreasing along the evolution, which establishes the long time behavior. In the subcritical
case $\rho<\rho_s$ the entropy method, based on suitable weighted logarithmic Sobolev inequalities
and interpolation estimates, is used to obtain explicit convergence rates to the equilibrium solution.
The close connection of the presented model and the Becker-D\"oring model is outlined by a family
of discrete Fokker-Planck type equations interpolating between both of them. This family of models
possesses a gradient flow structure, emphasizing their commonality.
