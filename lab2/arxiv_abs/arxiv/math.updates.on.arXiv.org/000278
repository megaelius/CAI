We study 4-dimensional higher-derivative conformal higher spin (CHS) fields generalising Weyl
graviton and conformal gravitino. They appear, in particular, as "induced" theories in the AdS/CFT
context. We consider their partition function on curved Einstein-space backgrounds like (A)dS
or sphere and Ricci-flat spaces. Remarkably, the bosonic (integer spin s) CHS partition function
appears to be given by a product of partition functions of the standard 2nd-derivative "partially
massless" spin s fields, generalising the previously known expression for the 1-loop Weyl graviton
(s=2) partition function. We compute the corresponding spin s Weyl anomaly coefficients a_s and
c_s. Our result for a_s reproduces the expression found recently in arXiv:1306.5242 by an indirect
method implied by AdS/CFT (which relates the partition function of a CHS field on S^4 to a ratio of
known partition functions of massless higher spin field in AdS_5 with alternate boundary conditions).
We also obtain similar results for the fermionic CHS fields. In this half-integer spin s case the
CHS partition function on (A)dS background is given by a product of squares of "partially massless"
spin s partition functions and one extra factor corresponding to a special massive conformally
invariant spin s field. It was noticed in arXiv:1306.5242 that the sum of the bosonic a_s coefficients
over all spins s is zero when computed using the zeta-function regularization, and we observe that
the same property is true also in the fermionic case, suggesting that the corresponding conformal
higher spin theory may be consistent at the quantum level.
