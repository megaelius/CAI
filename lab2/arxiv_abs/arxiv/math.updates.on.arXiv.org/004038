This paper examines an algebraic variety that controls an important part of the structure and representation
theory of the algebra $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$ introduced by Feigin and Odesskii. The $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$'s
are a family of quadratic algebras depending on a pair of coprime integers $n>k\ge 1$, an elliptic
curve $E$, and a point $\tau\in E$. For fixed $(n,k,E)$ they form a flat family of graded deformations
of the polynomial ring on $n$ variables. It is already known that the structure and representation
theory of $Q_{n,1}(E,\tau)$ is controlled by the geometry associated to $E$ embedded as a degree
$n$ normal curve in the projective space $\mathbb P^{n-1}$, and by the way in which the translation
automorphism $z\mapsto z+\tau$ interacts with that geometry. For $k\ge 2$ a similar phenomenon
occurs: $(E,\tau)$ is replaced by $(X_{n/k},\sigma)$ where $X_{n/k}\subseteq\mathbb P^{n-1}$
is the characteristic variety of the title and $\sigma$ is an automorphism of it that is determined
by the negative continued fraction for $\frac{n}{k}$. There is a surjective morphism $\Phi:E^g
\to X_{n/k}$ where $g$ is the length of that continued fraction. The main result in this paper is that
$X_{n/k}$ is a quotient of $E^g$ by the action of an explicit finite group. We also prove some assertions
made by Feigin and Odesskii. The morphism $\Phi$ is the natural one associated to a particular invertible
sheaf $\mathcal L_{n/k}$ on $E^g$. The generalized Fourier-Mukai transform associated to $\mathcal
L_{n/k}$ sends the set of isomorphism classes of degree-zero invertible $\mathcal O_E$-modules
to the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable locally free $\mathcal O_E$-modules of rank
$k$ and degree $n$. Thus $X_{n/k}$ has an importance independent of the role it plays in relation
to $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$. The forward $\sigma$-orbit of each point on $X_{n/k}$ determines a point
module for $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$.
