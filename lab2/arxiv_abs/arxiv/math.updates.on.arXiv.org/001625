In modern stream cipher, there are many algorithms, such as ZUC, LTE encryption algorithm and LTE
integrity algorithm, using bit-component sequences of $p$-ary $m$-sequences as the input of the
algorithm. Therefore, analyzing their statistical property (For example, autocorrelation,
linear complexity and 2-adic complexity) of bit-component sequences of $p$-ary $m$-sequences
is becoming an important research topic. In this paper, we first derive some autocorrelation properties
of LSB (Least Significant Bit) sequences of $p$-ary $m$-sequences, i.e., we convert the problem
of computing autocorrelations of LSB sequences of period $p^n-1$ for any positive $n\geq2$ to the
problem of determining autocorrelations of LSB sequence of period $p-1$. Then, based on this property
and computer calculation, we list some autocorrelation distributions of LSB sequences of $p$-ary
$m$-sequences with order $n$ for some small primes $p$'s, such as $p=3,5,7,11,17,31$. Additionally,
using their autocorrelation distributions and the method inspired by Hu, we give the lower bounds
on the 2-adic complexities of these LSB sequences. Our results show that the main parts of all the
lower bounds on the 2-adic complexity of these LSB sequencesare larger than $\frac{N}{2}$, where
$N$ is the period of these sequences. Therefor, these bounds are large enough to resist the analysis
of RAA (Rational Approximation Algorithm) for FCSR (Feedback with Carry Shift Register). Especially,
for a Mersenne prime $p=2^k-1$, since all its bit-component sequences of a $p$-ary $m$-sequence
are shift equivalent, our results hold for all its bit-component sequences.
