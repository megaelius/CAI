The paper investigates the sensitivity of the inverse problem of recovering the velocity field
in a bounded domain from the boundary dynamic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DDtN) for the wave equation.
Three main results are obtained: (1) assuming that two velocity fields are non-trapping and are
equal to a constant near the boundary, it is shown that the two induced scattering relations must
be identical if their corresponding DDtN maps are sufficiently close; (2) a geodesic X-ray transform
operator with matrix-valued weight is introduced by linearizing the operator which associates
each velocity field with its induced Hamiltonian flow. A selected set of geodesics whose conormal
bundle can cover the cotangent space at an interior point is used to recover the singularity of the
X-ray transformed function at the point; a local stability estimate is established for this case.
Although fold caustics are allowed along these geodesics, it is required that these caustics contribute
to a smoother term in the transform than the point itself. The existence of such a set of geodesics
is guaranteed under some natural assumptions in dimension greater than or equal to three by the classification
result on caustics and regularity theory of Fourier Integral Operators. The interior point with
the above required set of geodesics is called "fold-regular"; (3) assuming that a background velocity
field with every interior point fold-regular is fixed and another velocity field is sufficiently
close to it and satisfies a certain orthogonality condition, it is shown that if the two corresponding
DDtN maps are sufficiently close then they must be equal.
