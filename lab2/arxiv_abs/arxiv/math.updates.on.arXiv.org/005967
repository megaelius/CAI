This paper is concerned with the leader-following output consensus problem in the framework of
distributed nonlinear observers. In stead of certain hypotheses on the leader system, a group of
geometric conditions is put forward to develop a novel distributed observer strategy with less
conservatism, thereby definitely improving the applicability of the existing results. To be more
specific, the improved distributed observer can precisely handle consensus problems for some
nonlinear leader systems which are invalid for the traditional strategies with the certain assumption,
such as Elastic Shaft Single Linkage Manipulator (ESSLM) systems and most of first-order nonlinear
systems. We prove the sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of our distributed observer's
error dynamic by proposing two pioneered lemmas to show the relationship between the maximum eigenvalues
of two matrices appearing in Lyapunov type matrices. Then, a partial feedback linearization method
with zero dynamic proposed in differential geometry is employed to design a purely decentralized
control law for the affine nonlinear multi-agent system. With this advancement, the existing results
can be regarded as a specific case owing to that the followers can be chosen as an arbitrary minimum
phase affine smooth nonlinear system. At last, the novel distributed observer and the improved
purely decentralized control law are applied in the distributed control framework to construct
a closed-loop system. We also prove the stability of closed-loop system to achieve leader-following
consensus, i.e., the distributed control framework is proved to satisfy certainty equivalence
principle. Our method is illustrated by ESSLM system and Van der Pol system as leader.
