The aim of this paper is to combine two classical theories, namely metric projective differential
geometry and superintegrable systems. These fields have received increasing attention during
the last decades: Second-order maximally superintegrable systems have been classified (in dimension
2 and 3) and their interrelations have been thoroughly explored. The underlying geometry is increasingly
better understood, but an algebraic-geometric understanding of the classification space is just
starting to be developed. Metric projective geometry, on the other hand, has also undergone significant
activity in recent years, and for instance the Lie Problem in dimension 2 has been solved. Superintegrable
systems whose underlying geometries are projectively related have been the subject in recent papers,
for instance systems without potential and (Darboux-)K{\oe}nigs systems from a global perspective.
However, a systematic approach to the topic still appears to be lacking. This paper explores 2-dimensional
superintegrable systems with potential that are defined on geodesically equivalent geometries,
considering what it means for such systems to be equivalent, and how to construct new systems by addition
of known ones. Concretely, we investigate second order maximally superintegrable systems in dimension
2 whose underlying metric admits one infinitesimal projective symmetry. For the non-trivial case,
which has recently been classified, we also explore the St\"ackel equivalence of such systems.
We find that they are non-degenerate and generically of St\"ackel type (111,11), while special
cases of type (21,0), (21,2) and (3,11) exist. In particular, the degenerate systems lie on algebraic
varieties within the space of projectively related superintegrable systems.
