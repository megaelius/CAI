We present a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that is based on radio signals
and the association of specular multipath components (MPCs) with geometric features. Especially
in indoor scenarios, localization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath propagation
and the unknown MPC-featureassociation. In our approach, specular reflections at flat surfaces
(e.g., walls) are described in terms of virtual anchors (VAs). The positions of these VAs are unknown
and possibly time-varying. We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem including the unknown
MPC-VA association. We represent this model by a factor graph, which enables the use of the belief
propagation (BP) scheme for efficient marginalization of the joint posterior distribution. The
resulting BP-based SLAM algorithm detects the VAs and estimates the time-varying position of the
mobile agent and the possibly time-varying positions of the VAs, thereby leveraging the MPCs in
the radio signal for improved accuracy and robustness of agent localization. A core aspect of the
algorithm is BP-based probabilistic MPC-VA association. Moreover, for improved initialization
of new VA positions, the states of unobserved potential VAs are modeled as a random finite set and
propagated in time by means of a "zero-measurement" probability hypothesis density filter. The
proposed BP-based SLAM algorithm has a low computational complexity and scales well in all relevant
system parameters. Experimental results using both synthetically generated measurements and
realultra-wideband radio signals demonstrate the excellent performance of the algorithm in challenging
indoor environments.
