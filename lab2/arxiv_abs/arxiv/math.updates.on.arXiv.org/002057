We develop topological dynamics for the group of automorphisms of a monster model of any given theory.
In particular, we find strong relationships between objects from topological dynamics (such as
the generalized Bohr compactification introduced by Glasner) and various Galois groups of the
theory in question, obtaining essentially new information about them, e.g. we present the closure
of the identity in the Lascar Galois group of the theory as the quotient of a compact, Hausdorff group
by a dense subgroup. We apply this to describe the complexity of bounded, invariant equivalence
relations, obtaining comprehensive results, subsuming and extending the existing results and
answering some open questions from earlier papers. We show that, in a countable theory, any such
relation restricted to the set of realizations of a complete type over $\emptyset$ is type-definable
if and only if it is smooth. Then we show a counterpart of this result for theories in an arbitrary (not
necessarily countable) language, obtaining also new information involving relative definability
of the relation in question. As a final conclusion we get the following trichotomy. Let $\mathfrak{C}$
be a monster model of a countable theory, $p \in S(\emptyset)$, and $E$ be a bounded, (invariant)
Borel (or, more generally, analytic) equivalence relation on $p(\mathfrak{C})$. Then, exactly
one of the following holds: (1) $E$ is relatively definable (on $p(\mathfrak{C})$), smooth, and
has finitely many classes, (2) $E$ is not relatively definable, but it is type-definable, smooth,
and has $2^{\aleph_0}$ classes, (3) $E$ is not type definable and not smooth, and has $2^{\aleph_0}$
classes. All the results which we obtain for bounded, invariant equivalence relations carry over
to the case of bounded index, invariant subgroups of definable groups.
