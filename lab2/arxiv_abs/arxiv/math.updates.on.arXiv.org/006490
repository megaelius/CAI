By utilizing tools from game theory, we develop a novel multi-period-multi-company demand response
framework considering the interactions between companies (sellers of energy) and their consumers
(buyers of energy). We model the interactions in terms of a Stackelberg game, where companies set
their prices and consumers respond by choosing their demands. We show that the underlying game has
a unique equilibrium at which the companies maximize their revenues while the consumers maximize
their utilities subject to their local constraints. Closed-form expressions are provided for
the optimal strategies of all players. Based on these solutions, a power allocation game has been
formulated, which is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, for which closed-form
expressions are also provided. This equilibrium is found under the assumption that companies can
freely allocate their power across the time horizon, but we also demonstrate that it is possible
to relax this assumption. We further provide a fast distributed algorithm for the computation of
all optimal strategies using only local information. We also study the effect of variations in the
number of periods (subdivisions of the time horizon) and the number of consumers. As a consequence,
we are able to find an appropriate company-to-consumer ratio when the number of consumers participating
in demand response exceeds some threshold. Furthermore, we show, both analytically and numerically,
that the multi-period scheme provides incentives for energy consumers to participate in demand
response, compared to the single-period framework studied in the literature. In our framework,
we provide a condition for the minimum budgets consumers need, and carry out case studies using real
life data to demonstrate the benefits of the approach, which show potential savings of up to $30\%$
and equilibrium prices that have low volatility.
