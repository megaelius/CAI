We introduce the concept of {\it fresh data trading}, in which a destination user requests, and pays
for, fresh data updates from a source provider, and data freshness is captured by the {\it age of information}
(AoI) metric. Keeping data fresh relies on frequent data updates by the source, which motivates
the source to {\it price fresh data}. In this work, the destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled
as a general increasing function of the AoI. The source designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its
profit; the destination chooses a data update schedule to trade off its payments to the source and
its age-related cost. Depending on different real-time applications and scenarios, we study both
a predictable-deadline and an unpredictable-deadline models. The key challenge of designing
the optimal pricing scheme lies in the destination's time-interdependent valuations, due to the
nature of AoI and the infinite-dimensional and dynamic optimization. To this end, we consider three
pricing schemes that exploit and understand the profitability of three different dimensions in
designing pricing: a {\it time-dependent} pricing scheme, in which the price for each update depends
on when it is requested; a {\it quantity-based} pricing scheme, in which the price of each update
depends on how many updates have been previously requested; a {\it subscription-based} pricing
scheme, in which the price for each update is flat-rate but the source charges an additional subscription
fee. Our analysis reveals that the optimal subscription-based pricing maximizes the source's
profit among all possible pricing schemes under both predictable deadline and unpredictable deadline
models; the optimal quantity-based pricing scheme is only optimal with a predictable deadline;
the time-dependent pricing scheme, under the unpredictable deadline, is asymptotically optimal
under significant time discounting.
