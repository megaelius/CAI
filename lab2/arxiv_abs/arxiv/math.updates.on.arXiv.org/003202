We analyze a coupled bulk-membrane PDE model in which a scalar linear 2-D bulk diffusion process
is coupled through a linear Robin boundary condition to a two-component 1-D reaction-diffusion
(RD) system with Gierer-Meinhardt (nonlinear) reaction kinetics defined on the domain boundary.
For this coupled model, in the singularly perturbed limit of a long-range inhibition and short-range
activation for the membrane-bound species, asymptotic methods are used to analyze the existence
of localized steady-state multi-spike membrane-bound patterns, and to derive a nonlocal eigenvalue
problem (NLEP) characterizing $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time-scale instabilities of these patterns.
A central, and novel, feature of this NLEP is that it involves a membrane Green's function that is
coupled nonlocally to a bulk Green's function. When the domain is a disk, or in the well-mixed shadow-system
limit corresponding to an infinite bulk diffusivity, this Green's function problem is analytically
tractable, and as a result we will use a hybrid analytical-numerical approach to determine unstable
spectra of this NLEP. This analysis characterizes how the 2-D bulk diffusion process and the bulk-membrane
coupling modifies the well-known linear stability properties of steady-state spike patterns
for the 1-D Gierer-Meinhardt model in the absence of coupling. In particular, phase diagrams in
parameter space for our coupled model characterizing either oscillatory instabilities due to
Hopf bifurcations, or competition instabilities due to zero-eigenvalue crossings are constructed.
Finally, linear stability predictions from the NLEP analysis are confirmed with full numerical
finite-element simulations of the coupled PDE system.
