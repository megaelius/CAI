This paper is devoted to give quantitative and qualitative results on the geometry of surfaces in
the complex projective space containing finitely or infinitely many twistor lines, i.e. fibers
for the standard twistor fibration of the four sphere. In the first part of the paper we give general
results on the space of surfaces containing a finite, but fixed, number of disjoint lines (not twistor,
in general). We are able to compute the dimension of this space and to give regularity properties
on its general element. Then, thanks to a characterization of twistor lines, we prove a Density Lemma,
stating that the set of twistor lines is a Zariski dense in the Grassmannian of complex lines $Gr(2,4)$.
Afterwards, by means of the Density Lemma and of other standard tools from algebraic geometry, we
give, for any degree $d$ a lower bound on the number of twistor lines that an irreducible or smooth
surface may contain. In this setting we also control the singular locus and, suitably modifying
the bound, find surfaces containing a fixed number of twistor lines and no other line. In the last
part we study integral surfaces containing infinitely many twistor lines. These are all ruled by
lines but not cones. We are able to prove that, if the surface is rational then its degree must be even
and that there is no integral surface of degree 3 containing infinitely many twistor lines. For all
even degrees we are able to produce examples both by using the recent theory of slice regularity and
by giving a new construction relying on the geometry of normalization map. We close the paper with
an open question involving the possibility to find an integral surface of odd degree containing
infinitely many twistor lines.
