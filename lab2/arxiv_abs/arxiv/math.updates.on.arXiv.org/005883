We consider a long-range interacting particle system in which binary particles -- whose initial
states are chosen uniformly at random -- are located at the nodes of a flat torus $(\mathbb{Z}/h\mathbb{Z})^2$.
Each node of the torus is connected to all the nodes located in an $l_\infty$-ball of radius $w$ in
the toroidal space centered at itself and we assume that $h$ is exponentially larger than $w^2$.
Based on the states of the neighboring particles and on the value of a common intolerance threshold
$\tau$, every particle is labeled "stable," or "unstable." Every unstable particle that can become
stable by flipping its state is labeled "p-stable." Finally, unstable particles that remained
p-stable for a random, independent and identically distributed waiting time, flip their state
and become stable. When the waiting times have an exponential distribution and $\tau \le 1/2$, this
model is equivalent to a Schelling model of self-organized segregation in an open system, a zero-temperature
Ising model with Glauber dynamics, or an Asynchronous Cellular Automaton (ACA) with extended Moore
neighborhoods. We first prove a shape theorem for the spreading of the "affected" nodes of a given
state -- namely nodes on which a particle of a given state would be p-stable. As $w \rightarrow \infty$,
this spreading starts with high probability (w.h.p.) from any $l_\infty$-ball in the torus having
radius $w/2$ and containing only affected nodes, and continues for a time that is at least exponential
in the cardinalilty of the neighborhood of interaction $N = (2w+1)^2$. Second, we show that when
the process reaches a limiting configuration and no more state changes occur, \ for \ all ${\tau \in
(\tau^*,1-\tau^*) \setminus \{1/2\}}$ where ${\tau^* \approx 0.488}$, w.h.p. any particle is
contained in a large "monochromatic ball" of cardinality exponential in $N$.
