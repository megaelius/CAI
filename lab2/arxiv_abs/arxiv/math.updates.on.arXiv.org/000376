In mathematics there is a wide class of knot invariants that may be expressed in the form of multiple
line integrals computed along the trajectory C describing the spatial conformation of the knot.
In this work it is addressed the problem of evaluating invariants of this kind in the case in which
the knot is discrete, i.e. its trajectory is constructed by joining together a set of segments of
constant length. Such discrete knots appear almost everywhere in numerical simulations of systems
containing one dimensional ring-shaped objects. Examples are polymers, the vortex lines in fluids
and superfluids like helium and other quantum liquids. Formally, the trajectory of a discrete knot
is a piecewise smooth curve characterized by sharp corners at the joints between contiguous segments.
The presence of these corners spoils the topological invariance of the knot invariants considered
here and prevents the correct evaluation of their values. To solve this problem, a smoothing procedure
is presented, which eliminates the sharp corners and transforms the original path C into a curve
that is everywhere differentiable. The procedure is quite general and can be applied to any discrete
knot defined off or on lattice. This smoothing algorithm is applied to the computation of the Vassiliev
knot invariant of degree 2 denoted here with the symbol r(C). This is the simplest knot invariant
that admits a definition in terms of multiple line integrals. For a fast derivation of r(C), it is
used a Monte Carlo integration technique. It is shown that, after the smoothing, the values of r(C)
may be evaluated with an arbitrary precision. Several algorithms for the fast computation of the
Vassiliev knot invariant of degree 2 are provided.
