In this article, we investigate the role played by germs of curve singularities in the enumeration
of inflection points in families of curves acquiring singular members. More precisely, let $k$
be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, let $N \geq 2$ be an integer, and consider
an isolated complete intersection curve singularity germ $f \colon (k^N,0) \to (k^{N-1},0)$.
We introduce a numerical function $m \mapsto \operatorname{AD}_{(2)}^m(f)$ that arises as an
error term in the problem of counting $m^{\mathrm{th}}$-order weight-$2$ inflection points with
ramification sequence $(0, \dots, 0, 2)$ in a $1$-parameter family of curves acquiring a singularity
cut out analytically-locally by $f = 0$, and we compute this function for various singularity germs
$f$ and values of $m$. In particular, for a node defined by $f \colon (x,y) \mapsto xy$, we obtain the
explicit formula $\operatorname{AD}_{(2)}^m(xy) = {{m+1} \choose 4},$ and we deduce as a corollary
that $\operatorname{AD}_{(2)}^m(f) \geq (\operatorname{mult}_0 \Delta_f) \cdot {{m+1} \choose
4}$ for any germ $f$, where $\operatorname{mult}_0 \Delta_f$ is the multiplicity of the discriminant
locus $\Delta_f$ at the origin in the deformation space of $f$. Furthermore, we show that the numerical
function $m \mapsto \operatorname{AD}_{(2)}^m(f) -(\operatorname{mult}_0 \Delta_f) \cdot
{{m+1} \choose 4}$ is an analytic invariant that measures the extent to which the singularity "counts
as" an inflection point. We obtain similar results for weight-$2$ inflection points with ramification
sequence $(0, \dots, 0, 1,1)$ as well as for weight-$1$ inflection points, and we apply our results
to solve various enumerative problems concerning inflection points.
