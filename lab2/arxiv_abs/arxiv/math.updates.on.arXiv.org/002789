Information leakage rate is an intuitive metric that reflects the level of security in a wireless
communication system, however, there are few studies taking it into consideration. Existing work
on information leakage rate has two major limitations due to the complicated expression for the
leakage rate: 1) the analytical and numerical results give few insights into the trade-off between
system throughput and information leakage rate; 2) and the corresponding optimal designs of transmission
rates are not analytically tractable. To overcome such limitations and obtain an in-depth understanding
of information leakage rate in secure wireless communications, we propose an approximation for
the average information leakage rate in the fixed-rate transmission scheme. Different from the
complicated expression for information leakage rate in the literature, our proposed approximation
has a low-complexity expression, and hence, it is easy for further analysis. Based on our approximation,
the corresponding approximate optimal transmission rates are obtained for two transmission schemes
with different design objectives. Through analytical and numerical results, we find that for the
system maximizing throughput subject to information leakage rate constraint, the throughput
is an upward convex non-decreasing function of the security constraint and much too loose security
constraint does not contribute to higher throughput; while for the system minimizing information
leakage rate subject to throughput constraint, the average information leakage rate is a lower
convex increasing function of the throughput constraint.
