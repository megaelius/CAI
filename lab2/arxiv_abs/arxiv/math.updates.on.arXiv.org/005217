Consider a stream of status updates generated by a source, where each update is of one of two types:
high priority or ordinary (low priority). These updates are to be transmitted through a network
to a monitor. However, the transmission policy of each packet depends on the type of stream it belongs
to. For the low priority stream, we analyze and compare the performances of two transmission schemes:
(i) Ordinary updates are served in a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) fashion, whereas, in (ii),
the ordinary updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy. In both schemes,
high priority updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy and receive
preferential treatment. An arriving priority update discards and replaces any currently-in-service
high priority update, and preempts (with eventual resume for scheme (i)) any ordinary update. We
model the arrival processes of the two kinds of updates, in both schemes, as independent Poisson
processes. For scheme (i), we find the arrival and service rates under which the system is stable
and give closed-form expressions for average peak age and a lower bound on the average age of the ordinary
stream. For scheme (ii), we derive closed-form expressions for the average age and average peak
age of the high priority and low priority streams. We finally show that, if the service time is exponentially
distributed, the M/M/1/1 with preemption policy leads to an average age of the low priority stream
higher than the one achieved using the FCFS scheme. Therefore, the M/M//1/1 with preemption policy,
when applied on the low priority stream of updates and in the presence of a higher priority scheme,
is not anymore the optimal transmission policy from an age point of view.
