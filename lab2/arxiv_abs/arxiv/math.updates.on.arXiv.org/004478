Partial differential equations posed on surfaces arise in a number of applications. In this survey
we describe three popular finite element methods for approximating solutions to the Laplace-Beltrami
problem posed on an $n$-dimensional surface $\gamma$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$: the parametric,
trace, and narrow band methods. The parametric method entails constructing an approximating polyhedral
surface $\Gamma$ whose faces comprise the finite element triangulation. The finite element method
is then posed over the approximate surface $\Gamma$ in a manner very similar to standard FEM on Euclidean
domains. In the trace method it is assumed that the given surface $\gamma$ is embedded in an $n+1$-dimensional
domain $\Omega$ which has itself been triangulated. An $n$-dimensional approximate surface $\Gamma$
is then constructed roughly speaking by interpolating $\gamma$ over the triangulation of $\Omega$,
and the finite element space over $\Gamma$ consists of the trace (restriction) of a standard finite
element space on $\Omega$ to $\Gamma$. In the narrow band method the PDE posed on the surface is extended
to a triangulated $n+1$-dimensional band about $\gamma$ whose width is proportional to the diameter
of elements in the triangulation. In all cases we provide optimal a priori error estimates for the
lowest-order finite element methods, and we also present a posteriori error estimates for the parametric
and trace methods. Our presentation focuses especially on the relationship between the regularity
of the surface $\gamma$, which is never assumed better than of class $C^2$, the manner in which $\gamma$
is represented in theory and practice, and the properties of the resulting methods.
