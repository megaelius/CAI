We consider the reconstruction of a heterogeneous coefficient field in a Robin boundary condition
on an inaccessible part of the boundary in a Poisson problem with an uncertain (or unknown) inhomogeneous
conductivity field in the interior of the domain. To account for model errors that stem from the uncertainty
in the conductivity coefficient, we treat the unknown conductivity as a nuisance parameter and
carry out approximative premarginalization over it, and invert for the Robin coefficient field
only. We approximate the related modelling errors via the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach.
The uncertainty analysis presented here relies on a local linearization of the parameter-to-observable
map at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates, which leads to a normal (Gaussian) approximation
of the parameter posterior density. To compute the MAP point we apply an inexact Newton conjugate
gradient approach based on the adjoint methodology. The construction of the covariance is made
tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the data misfit component of the Hessian. Two
numerical experiments are considered: one where the prior covariance on the conductivity is isotropic,
and one where the prior covariance on the conductivity is anisotropic. Results are compared to those
based on standard error models, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of the posterior uncertainty
estimates. We show that the BAE approach is a feasible one in the sense that the predicted posterior
uncertainty is consistent with the actual estimation errors, while neglecting the related modelling
error yields infeasible estimates for the Robin coefficient. In addition, we demonstrate that
the BAE approach is approximately as computationally expensive (measured in the number of PDE solves)
as the conventional error approach.
