The variational inequality problem represents an effective tool for capturing a range of phenomena
arising in engineering, economics, and applied sciences. Prompted by the role of uncertainty,
recent efforts have considered both the analysis as well as the solution of the associated stochastic
variational inequality problem where the map is expectation-valued. Yet, a majority of the studies
have been restricted to regimes where the map is monotone. This work is motivated by the growing interest
in pseudomonotone stochastic variational inequality problems (PSVIs); such problems emerge
from product pricing, fractional optimization problems, and subclasses of economic equilibrium
problems arising in uncertain regimes. In this paper, we first observe that a direct application
of standard existence/uniqueness theory requires a tractable expression for the integrals arising
from the expectation. Instead, we develop integration- free sufficiency conditions for the existence
and uniqueness of solutions to PSVIs. We consider the solution of PSVIs via stochastic approximation
(SA) schemes, motivated by the observation that almost all of the prior SA schemes can accommodate
monotone SVIs. Under various forms of pseudomonotonicity, we prove that the solution iterates
produced by extragradient SA schemes converge to the solution set in an almost sure sense. This result
is further extended to mirror-prox regimes and an analogous statement is also provided for monotone
regimes under a weak-sharpness requirement. Under stronger conditions, we derive the optimal
initial steplength and show that the mean-squared error in the solution iterates produced by the
extragradient SA scheme converges at the optimal rate of O(1/K). Finally, both the asymptotics
and the empirical rates of the schemes are studied on a set of pseudomonotone and non-monotone variational
problems.
