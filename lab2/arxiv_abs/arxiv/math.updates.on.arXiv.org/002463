We consider the wave equation on Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and more generally Kerr-Newman-de
Sitter black hole spacetimes with $\Lambda>0$. The strength of the blue-shift instability associated
to the Cauchy horizon of these spacetimes has been the subject of much discussion, since-in contrast
to the $\Lambda=0$ case-the competition with the decay associated to the region between the event
and cosmological horizons is delicate. Of particular interest is the question as to whether generic,
admissible initial data posed on a Cauchy surface lead to solutions whose local energy blows up at
the Cauchy horizon, for this statement holds in the $\Lambda = 0$ case and would correspond precisely
to the blow up required by Christodoulou's formulation of strong cosmic censorship. Some recent
heuristic work suggests that the answer is in general negative for solutions arising from sufficiently
smooth data, such that for all such data, the arising solutions have finite local energy at the Cauchy
horizon. In this short note, we shall show in contrast that, by slightly relaxing the smoothness
assumption on initial data, we are able to prove the analogue of the Christodoulou statement in the
affirmative, i.e. we show that for generic data in our allowed class, the local energy blow-up statement
indeed holds at the Cauchy horizon, for all subextremal black hole parameter ranges. We present
two distinct proofs. Our slightly enlarged class of initial data is still sufficiently regular
to ensure both stability and decay properties in the region between the event and cosmological horizons
as well as the boundedness and continuous extendibility beyond the Cauchy horizon. This suggests
thus that it is finally this class which may provide the correct setting to formulate the genericity
condition in strong cosmic censorship.
