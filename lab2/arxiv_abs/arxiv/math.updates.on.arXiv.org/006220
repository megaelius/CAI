The practical realization of end-to-end training of communication systems is fundamentally limited
by its accessibility of the channel gradient. To overcome this major burden, the idea of generative
adversarial networks (GANs) that learn to mimic the actual channel behavior has been recently proposed
in the literature. Contrarily to handcrafted classical channel modeling, which can never fully
capture the real world, GANs promise, in principle, the ability to learn any physical impairment,
enabled by the data-driven learning algorithm. In this work, we verify the concept of GAN-based
autoencoder training in actual over-the-air (OTA) measurements. To improve training stability,
we first extend the concept to conditional Wasserstein GANs and embed it into a state-of-the-art
autoencoder-architecture, including bitwise estimates and an outer channel code. Further, in
the same framework, we compare the existing three different training approaches: model-based
pre-training with receiver finetuning, reinforcement learning (RL) and GAN-based channel modeling.
For this, we show advantages and limitations of GAN-based end-to-end training. In particular,
for non-linear effects, it turns out that learning the whole exploration space becomes prohibitively
complex. Finally, we show that the training strategy benefits from a simpler (training) data acquisition
when compared to RL-based training, which requires continuous transmitter weight updates. This
becomes an important practical bottleneck due to limited bandwidth and latency between transmitter
and training algorithm that may even operate at physically different locations.
