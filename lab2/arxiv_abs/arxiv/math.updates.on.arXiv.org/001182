Millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave) band provides orders of magnitude higher bandwidth compared with the
traditional sub-6 GHz band. Communication at mm-Waves is, however, quite challenging due to the
severe path loss. To cope with this problem, a directional beamforming both at the Base Station (BS)
side and the user side is necessary to find a strong path connecting the BS and the user. Finding such
beamforming directions is referred to as the Beam Alignment (BA) and is known to be a challenging
problem. In this paper, we propose a new BA scheme that finds a strong path connecting the BS and the
user by estimating the second order statistics of the channel. As a result, our proposed algorithm
is highly robust to variations of the channel statistics compared with the other works in the literature.
In our proposed scheme, the BS probes the channel in the Downlink (DL) letting each user to estimate
its own channel (i.e., a strong path connecting the user to the BS), where all the users within the
BS coverage are trained simultaneously. Thus, the complexity of our proposed BA (channel estimation)
is independent of the number of users in the system. We pose the channel estimation at the user side
as a Compressed Sensing (CS) of a non-negative signal and use the recently developed Non-Negative
Least Squares (NNLS) technique to solve it efficiently. We use numerical simulation to assess the
performance of our proposed algorithm and compare it with the performance of other competitive
methods in the literature. The results illustrate that our approach incurs less training overhead,
exhibits higher efficiency in multi-user scenarios, and is highly robust to variations in channel
statistics.
