We present a new family of very high order accurate direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
Finite Volume (FV) and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic
PDE systems on moving Voronoi meshes that are regenerated at each time step and which explicitly
allow topology changes in time. The Voronoi tessellations are obtained from a set of generator points
that move with the local fluid velocity. We employ an AREPO-type approach, which rapidly rebuilds
a new high quality mesh exploiting the previous one, but \textit{rearranging} the element shapes
and neighbors in order to guarantee that the mesh evolution is robust even for vortex flows and for
very long computational times. The old and new Voronoi elements associated to the same generator
point are connected in space--time to construct closed space-time control volumes, whose bottom
and top faces may be polygons with a different number of sides. We also need to incorporate some degenerate
space--time sliver elements, which are needed in order to fill the space-time holes that arise because
of the topology changes. The final ALE FV-DG scheme is obtained by a novel redesign of the high order
accurate fully discrete direct ALE schemes of Boscheri and Dumbser, which have been extended here
to general moving Voronoi meshes and space--time sliver elements, and it is based on the integration
over arbitrary shaped closed space-time control volumes. Numerical convergence studies as well
as a large set of benchmark problems for hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) demonstrate
the accuracy and robustness of the method. Our numerical results clearly show that the new combination
of very high order schemes with regenerated meshes that allow topology changes in each time step
lead to substantial improvements over the existing state of the art in direct ALE methods.
