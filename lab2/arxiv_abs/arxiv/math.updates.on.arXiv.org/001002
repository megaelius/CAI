We consider the Regge limit of the CFT correlation functions $\langle {\cal J} {\cal J} {\cal O}{\cal
O}\rangle$ and $\langle TT {\cal O}{\cal O}\rangle$, where ${\cal J}$ is a vector current, $T$ is
the stress tensor and ${\cal O}$ is some scalar operator. These correlation functions are related
by a type of Fourier transform to the AdS phase shift of the dual 2-to-2 scattering process. AdS unitary
was conjectured some time ago to be positivity of the imaginary part of this bulk phase shift. This
condition was recently proved using purely CFT arguments. For large $N$ CFTs we further expand on
these ideas, by considering the phase shift in the Regge limit, which is dominated by the leading
Regge pole with spin $j(\nu)$, where $\nu$ is a spectral parameter. We compute the phase shift as
a function of the bulk impact parameter, and then use AdS unitarity to impose bounds on the analytically
continued OPE coefficients $C_{{\cal J}{\cal J}j(\nu)}$ and $C_{TTj(\nu)}$ that describe the
coupling to the leading Regge trajectory of the current ${\cal J}$ and stress tensor $T$. AdS unitary
implies that the OPE coefficients associated to non-minimal couplings of the bulk theory vanish
at the intercept value $\nu=0$, for any CFT. Focusing on the case of large gap theories, this result
can be used to show that the physical OPE coefficients $C_{{\cal J}{\cal J}T}$ and $C_{TTT}$, associated
to non-minimal bulk couplings, scale with the gap $\Delta_g$ as $\Delta_g^{-2}$ or $\Delta_g^{-4}$.
Also, looking directly at the unitarity condition imposed at the OPE coefficients $C_{{\cal J}{\cal
J}T}$ and $C_{TTT}$ results precisely in the known conformal collider bounds, giving a new CFT derivation
of these bounds. We finish with remarks on finite $N$ theories and show directly in the CFT that the
spin function $j(\nu)$ is convex, extending this property to the continuation to complex spin.
