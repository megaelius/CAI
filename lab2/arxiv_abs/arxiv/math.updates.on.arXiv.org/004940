We obtain the best known quantitative estimates for the $L^p$-Poincar\'e and log-Sobolev inequalities
on domains in various ideal sub-Riemannian manifolds, including ideal Carnot groups and in particular
ideal generalized H-type Carnot groups and the Heisenberg groups, the Grushin plane, and various
Sasakian and $3$-Sasakian manifolds. Moreover, this constitutes the first time that a quantitative
estimate independent of the dimension is established on these spaces. For instance, the Li--Yau
/ Zhong--Yang spectral-gap estimate holds on all Heisenberg groups of arbitrary dimension up to
a factor of $4$. We achieve this by introducing a quasi-convex relaxation of the Lott--Sturm--Villani
$\mathsf{CD}(K,N)$ condition we call the Quasi Curvature-Dimension condition $\mathsf{QCD}(Q,K,N)$.
Our motivation stems from a recent interpolation inequality along Wasserstein geodesics in the
ideal sub-Riemannian setting due to Barilari and Rizzi. We show that on an ideal sub-Riemannian
manifold of dimension $n$, the Measure Contraction Property $\mathsf{MCP}(K,N)$ implies $\mathsf{QCD}(Q,K,N)$
with $Q = 2^{N-n} \geq 1$, thereby verifying the latter property on the aforementioned spaces. By
extending the localization paradigm to completely general interpolation inequalities, we reduce
the study of various analytic and geometric inequalities on $\mathsf{QCD}$ spaces to the one-dimensional
case. Consequently, we deduce that while ideal (strictly) sub-Riemannian manifolds do not satisfy
any type of $\mathsf{CD}$ condition, they satisfy numerous functional inequalities with \emph{exactly
the same} quantitative dependence (up to a factor of $Q$) as their $\mathsf{CD}$ counterparts.
