Let $F$ be a field, let $\sigma$ be an automorphism of $F$ of order 1 or 2 and let $V$ be a finite dimensional
vector space. A well-known theorem states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
regular $\sigma$-sesquilinear forms on $V$, considered up to multiplication by an element of $F$,
and the set of anti-automorphisms of $End_F(V)$ whose restriction to $F=\Cent(End_F(V))$ is $\sigma$.
This result is the foundation of the widely studied connection between hermitian forms and involutions.
In this paper, we present a new notion of "general bilinear forms", which allows us to prove a generalization
of the previous correspondence to certain modules over arbitrary rings. That is, if $R$ is a ring
(not necessarily commutative, possibly without involution) and $M$ is a right $R$-module, then
under mild assumptions, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the regular general bilinear
forms over $M$, considered up to similarity, and the set of anti-automorphisms of $End_R(M)$. In
particular, we obtain a new proof of the classical result, which do not use the Skolem-Noether theorem.
After discussing some details and providing various examples, we present several applications
of the generalized correspondence. Amongst are a new short proof of the fact that an order 2 class
in the Brauer group of a commutative ring has a representative admitting an involution of the first
kind. Additional results include: (1) A semilocal ring that is Morita equivalent to its opposite
is Morita equivalent to a ring with an anti-automorphism. (2) If $R$ is a semiperfect (resp. simple
artinian) ring with an involution and $S$ is the basic ring that is Morita equivalent to $R$, then
$\Mat{S}{2}$ (resp.\ $S$) has an involution.
