This paper is concerned with resolvent estimates on the real axis for the Helmholtz equation posed
in the exterior of a bounded obstacle with Dirichlet boundary conditions when the obstacle is trapping.
There are two resolvent estimates for this situation currently in the literature: (i) in the case
of elliptic trapping the general "worst case" bound of exponential growth applies, and examples
show that this growth can be realised through some sequence of wavenumbers, (ii) in the prototypical
case of hyperbolic trapping where the Helmholtz equation is posed in the exterior of two strictly
convex obstacles (or several obstacles with additional constraints) the nontrapping resolvent
estimate holds with a logarithmic loss. This paper proves the first resolvent estimate for parabolic
trapping by obstacles, studying a class of obstacles the prototypical example of which is the exterior
of two squares (in 2-d), or two cubes (in 3-d), whose sides are parallel. We show, via developments
of the vector-field/multiplier argument of Morawetz and the first application of this methodology
to trapping configurations, that a resolvent estimate holds with a polynomial loss over the nontrapping
estimate. We use this bound, along with the other trapping resolvent estimates, to prove results
about integral-equation formulations of the boundary value problem in the case of trapping. Feeding
these bounds into existing frameworks for analysing finite and boundary element methods, we obtain
the first wavenumber-explicit proofs of convergence for numerical methods for solving the Helmholtz
equation in the exterior of a trapping obstacle.
