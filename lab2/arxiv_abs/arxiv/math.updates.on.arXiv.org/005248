We study the logical complexity of proofs in cyclic arithmetic ($\mathsf{CA}$), as introduced
in Simpson '17, in terms of quantifier alternations of formulae occurring. Writing $C\Sigma_n$
for (the logical consequences of) cyclic proofs containing only $\Sigma_n$ formulae, our main
result is that $I\Sigma_{n+1}$ and $C\Sigma_n$ prove the same $\Pi_{n+1}$ theorems, for all $n\geq
0$. Furthermore, due to the 'uniformity' of our method, we also show that $\mathsf{CA}$ and Peano
Arithmetic ($\mathsf{PA}$) proofs of the same theorem differ only exponentially in size. The inclusion
$I\Sigma_{n+1} \subseteq C\Sigma_n$ is obtained by proof theoretic techniques, relying on normal
forms and structural manipulations of $\mathsf{PA}$ proofs. It improves upon the natural result
that $I\Sigma_n$ is contained in $C\Sigma_n$. The converse inclusion, $C\Sigma_n \subseteq I\Sigma_{n+1}$,
is obtained by calibrating the approach of Simpson '17 with recent results on the reverse mathematics
of B\"uchi's theorem in Ko{\l}odziejczyk, Michalewski, Pradic & Skrzypczak '16 (KMPS'16), and
specialising to the case of cyclic proofs. These results improve upon the bounds on proof complexity
and logical complexity implicit in Simpson '17 and also an alternative approach due to Berardi &
Tatsuta '17. The uniformity of our method also allows us to recover a metamathematical account of
fragments of $\mathsf{CA}$; in particular we show that, for $n\geq 0$, the consistency of $C\Sigma_n$
is provable in $I\Sigma_{n+2}$ but not $I\Sigma_{n+1}$. As a result, we show that certain versions
of McNaughton's theorem (the determinisation of $\omega$-word automata) are not provable in $\mathsf{RCA}_0$,
partially resolving an open problem from KMPS '16.
