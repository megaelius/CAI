In conventional gauge theories, any local gauge symmetry generator is accompanied by a corresponding
gauge boson in order to compensate the transformation of the gauge-covariant derivation against
the local gauge transformations as acting on the matter fields. Indeed, whenever the gauge group
is purely compact, as in usual gauge theories, the invocation of corresponding gauge bosons as compensating
fields is unavoidable. That is because there exist no nontrivial forgetful homomorphisms onto
some smaller Lie groups from the full gauge group. In this paper we show a mechanism that at the price
of allowing some non-semisimple component of the gauge group besides the compact part, it is possible
to construct such Lagrangians that the non-semisimple part of the local gauge group only acts on
the matter fields, without invoking corresponding gauge bosons. It shall be shown that already
the ordinary Dirac equation admits such a hidden symmetry related to the dilatation group, thus
this mechanism cannot be called unphysical. Then, we give our more complicated example Lagrangian,
in which the gauge group is an indecomposable Lie group built up of a nilpotent part and of a compact
part. Since the nilpotent part does carry also Lorentz charges in our example, the first order symmetries
of the pertinent theory give rise to a unified gauge--Poincar\'e group, bypassing Coleman--Mandula
and related no-go theorems in a different way in comparison to SUSY. The existence of a local symmetry
without a gauge boson is already mathematically very striking, but this new mechanism might even
be useful to eventually try to substitute SUSY for a unification concept of symmetries.
