We introduce and study a novel tensor approach for fast and accurate assembled summation of a large
number of lattice-allocated potentials represented on 3D $N\times N \times N$ grid with the computational
requirements only \emph{weakly dependent} on the number of summed potentials. It is based on the
assembled low-rank canonical tensor representations of the collected potentials using pointwise
sums of shifted canonical vectors representing the single generating function, say the Newton
kernel. For a sum of electrostatic potentials over $L\times L \times L$ lattice embedded in a box
the required storage scales linearly in the 1D grid-size, $O(N )$, while the numerical cost is estimated
by $O(N L)$. For periodic boundary conditions, the storage demand remains proportional to the 1D
grid-size of a unit cell, $n=N/L$, while the numerical cost reduces to $O(N)$, that outperforms
the FFT-based Ewald-type summation algorithms of complexity $O(N^3 \log N)$. The complexity in
the grid parameter $N$ can be reduced even to the logarithmic scale $O(\log N)$ by using data-sparse
representation of canonical $N$-vectors via the quantics tensor approximation. For justification,
we prove an upper bound on the quantics ranks for the canonical vectors in the overall lattice sum.
The presented approach is beneficial in applications which require further functional calculus
with the lattice potential, say, scalar product with a function, integration or differentiation,
which can be performed easily in tensor arithmetics on large 3D grids with 1D cost. Numerical tests
illustrate the performance of the tensor summation method and confirm the estimated bounds on the
tensor ranks.
