The birationality problem asks whether there is a birational map $f$ between two given irreducible
complex algebraic varieties $X$ and $Y$. If $X,Y\subset \mathbb{P}^n$, where $ \dim (X), \dim (Y)\leq
n-2$, Mella and Polastry (improved in subsequent work by Ciliberto, Cueto, Mella, Ranestad and
Zwiernik) showed that this problem is equivalent to finding a birational map $F=[F_0:F_1:\ldots
:F_n]:\mathbb{P}^n\dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ whose restriction to $X$ is $f$. As usual,
we define by $\deg (F)$ the maximum of degrees of $F_1,\ldots ,F_n$. We consider the following weaker
question: {\bf Bounded Birationality Problem.} Given $X,Y$ irreducible complex algebraic subvarieties
of $\mathbb{P}^n$ (where $n\geq 2$) and a positive integer $d$. Is there a (bi)rational map $F:\mathbb{P}^n\dashrightarrow
\mathbb{P}^n$ with $\deg (F)\leq d$ whose restriction to $X$ is a birational map $F|_X:X\dashrightarrow
Y$? The main result of this paper is that Bounded Birationality Problem is computable. More precisely,
we prove the following: {\bf Theorem.} The Bounded Birationality Problem has a solution if and only
if at least one among {\bf explicitly} constructed $C_1$ systems of polynomial equations in $C_2$
variables, each polynomial of degree bounded from above by a constant $C_3$, has one solution in
$\mathbb{C}$. Here $C_1, C_2, C_3$ and the number of polynomials in each system of equations are
explicitly bounded in terms of $X, Y$, $\deg (F)$ and $n$. We also prove similar results for the case
$f$ is a dominant rational map, regular morphism or isomorphism. All of these results are valid for
varieties over an arbitrary algebraically closed field.
