Heavy data load and wide cover range have always been crucial problems for online data processing
in internet of things (IoT). Recently, mobile-edge computing (MEC) and unmanned aerial vehicle
base stations (UAV-BSs) have emerged as promising techniques in IoT. In this paper, we propose a
three-layer online data processing network based on MEC technique. On the bottom layer, raw data
are generated by widely distributed sensors, which reflects local information. Upon them, unmanned
aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) are deployed as moving MEC servers, which collect data and
conduct initial steps of data processing. On top of them, a center cloud receives processed results
and conducts further evaluation. As this is an online data processing system, the edge nodes should
stabilize delay to ensure data freshness. Furthermore, limited onboard energy poses constraints
to edge processing capability. To smartly manage network resources for saving energy and stabilizing
delay, we develop an online determination policy based on Lyapunov Optimization. In cases of low
data rate, it tends to reduce edge processor frequency for saving energy. In the presence of high
data rate, it will smartly allocate bandwidth for edge data offloading. Meanwhile, hovering UAV-BSs
bring a large and flexible service coverage, which results in the problem of effective path planning.
In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning and develop an online path planning algorithm.
Taking observations of around environment as input, a CNN network is trained to predict the reward
of each action. By simulations, we validate its effectiveness in enhancing service coverage. The
result will contribute to big data processing in future IoT.
