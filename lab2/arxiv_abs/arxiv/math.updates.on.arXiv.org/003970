We consider the problem of recovering linear image $Bx$ of a signal $x$ known to belong to a given convex
compact set ${\cal X}$ from indirect observation $\omega=Ax+\xi$ of $x$ corrupted by random noise
$\xi$ with finite covariance matrix. It is shown that under some assumptions on ${\cal X}$ (satisfied,
e.g., when ${\cal X}$ is the intersection of $K$ concentric ellipsoids/elliptic cylinders, or
the unit ball of the spectral norm in the space of matrices) and on the norm $\|\cdot\|$ used to measure
the recovery error (satisfied, e.g., by $\|\cdot\|_p$-norms, $1\leq p\leq 2$, on ${\mathbf{R}}^m$
and by the nuclear norm on the space of matrices), one can build, in a computationally efficient manner,
a "presumably good" linear in observations estimate, and that in the case of zero mean Gaussian observation
noise, this estimate is near-optimal among all (linear and nonlinear) estimates in terms of its
worst-case, over $x\in {\cal X}$, expected $\|\cdot\|$-loss. These results form an essential
extension of those in our paper arXiv:1602.01355, where the assumptions on ${\cal X}$ were more
restrictive, and the norm $\|\cdot\|$ was assumed to be the Euclidean one. In addition, we develop
near-optimal estimates for the case of "uncertain-but-bounded" noise, where all we know about
$\xi$ is that it is bounded in a given norm by a given $\sigma$. Same as in arXiv:1602.01355, our results
impose no restrictions on $A$ and $B$. This arXiv paper slightly strengthens the journal publication
