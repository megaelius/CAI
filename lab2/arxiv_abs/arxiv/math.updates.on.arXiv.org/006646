The usual approach to model reduction for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is
to construct a linear space $V_n$ which approximates well the solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$
consisting of all solutions $u(y)$ with $y$ the vector of parameters. This linear reduced model
$V_n$ is then used for various tasks such as building an online forward solver for the PDE or estimating
parameters from data observations. It is well understood in other problems of numerical computation
that nonlinear methods such as adaptive approximation, $n$-term approximation, and certain tree-based
methods may provide improved numerical efficiency. For model reduction, a nonlinear method would
replace the linear space $V_n$ by a nonlinear space $\Sigma_n$. This idea has already been suggested
in recent papers on model reduction where the parameter domain is decomposed into a finite number
of cells and a linear space of low dimension is assigned to each cell. Up to this point, little is known
in terms of performance guarantees for such a nonlinear strategy. Moreover, most numerical experiments
for nonlinear model reduction use a parameter dimension of only one or two. In this work, a step is
made towards a more cohesive theory for nonlinear model reduction. Framing these methods in the
general setting of library approximation allows us to give a first comparison of their performance
with those of standard linear approximation for any general compact set. We then turn to the study
these methods for solution manifolds of parametrized elliptic PDEs. We study a very specific example
of library approximation where the parameter domain is split into a finite number $N$ of rectangular
cells and where different reduced affine spaces of dimension $m$ are assigned to each cell. The performance
of this nonlinear procedure is analyzed from the viewpoint of accuracy of approximation versus
$m$ and $N$.
