In recent years, several fast solvers for the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation
that mathematically models the scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by penetrable inhomogeneous
obstacles, have been proposed. While many of these fast methodologies exhibit rapid convergence
for smoothly varying scattering configurations, the rate for most of them reduce to either linear
or quadratic when material properties are allowed to jump across the interface. A notable exception
to this is a recently introduced Nystr\"{o}m scheme [J. Comput. Phys., 311 (2016), 258--274] that
utilizes a specialized quadrature in the boundary region for a high-order treatment of the material
interface. In this text, we present a solution framework that relies on the specialized boundary
integrator to enhance the convergence rate of other fast, low order methodologies without adding
to their computational complexity of $O(N \log N)$ for an $N$-point discretization. In particular,
to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we explain its implementation to enhance
the order to convergence of two schemes, one introduced by Duan and Rokhlin [J. Comput. Phys., 228(6)
(2009), 2152--2174] that is based on a pre-corrected trapezoidal rule while the other by Bruno and
Hyde [J. Comput. Phys., 200(2) (2004), 670--694] which relies on a suitable decomposition of the
Green's function via Addition theorem. In addition to a detailed description of these methodologies,
we also present a comparative performance study of the improved versions of these two and the Nystr\"{o}m
solver in [J. Comput. Phys., 311 (2016), 258--274] through a wide range of numerical experiments.
