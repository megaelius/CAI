Multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MCCDMA) combines an orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) modulation with a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) scheme and hence
exploits the advantages of OFDM as well as CDMA. However, a major drawback in MC-CDMA system is high
peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR). This problem can be dealt by employing proper codes.
A Zcomplementary code set (ZCCS) is a collection of codes with same length and an equal number of constituent
sequences or two-dimensional matrices with zero correlation zone (ZCZ) properties. In a ZCCS based
MC-CDMA system, the PMEPR is determined by column sequence PMEPR of the codes. The column sequence
PMEPR of existing ZCCS by using Boolean function approach is determined by the number of constituents
sequences which are the same as the number of sub-carrier in a ZCCS based MC-CDMA system. Although,
all existing Boolean function approach is a direct method to construct ZCCS and it is feasible for
rapid hardware generation particularly for long ZCCSs, the large number of sub-carrier in an MC-CDMA
system degrades the performance of an existing ZCCS based MC-CDMA system. In this paper, we propose
a construction of ZCCS with maximum column sequence PMEPR 2 by using generalized Boolean functions
(GBFs). The proposed ZCCS is optimal with respect to the theoretical upper bound. Our proposed construction
can also generate ZCCS with inter-group complementary property or Inter-group complementary
(IGC) code set with maximum column sequence PMEPR 2 whereas the maximum column sequence PMEPR of
all existing IGC code set is given by the number of constituent sequences in a code. This work also
establishes a link from ZCCS and IGC code set to higer-order Reed-Muller (RM) code.
