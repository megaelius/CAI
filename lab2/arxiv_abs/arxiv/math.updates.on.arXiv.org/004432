We study the long time behaviour of a large class of diffusion processes on $R^N$, generated by second
order differential operators of (possibly) degenerate type. The operators that we consider {\em
need not} satisfy the H\"ormander condition. Instead, they satisfy the so-called UFG condition,
introduced by Herman, Lobry and Sussman in the context of geometric control theory and later by Kusuoka
and Stroock, this time with probabilistic motivations. In this paper we study UFG diffusions and
demonstrate the importance of such a class of processes in several respects: roughly speaking i)
we show that UFG processes constitute a family of SDEs which exhibit multiple invariant measures
and for which one is able to describe a systematic procedure to determine the basin of attraction
of each invariant measure (equilibrium state). ii) We use an explicit change of coordinates to prove
that every UFG diffusion can be, at least locally, represented as a system consisting of an SDE coupled
with an ODE, where the ODE evolves independently of the SDE part of the dynamics. iii) As a result,
UFG diffusions are inherently "less smooth" than hypoelliptic SDEs; more precisely, we prove that
UFG processes do not admit a density with respect to Lebesgue measure on the entire space, but only
on suitable time-evolving submanifolds, which we describe. iv) We show that our results and techniques,
which we devised for UFG processes, can be applied to the study of the long-time behaviour of non-autonomous
hypoelliptic SDEs and therefore produce several results on this latter class of processes as well.
v) Because processes that satisfy the (uniform) parabolic H\"ormander condition are UFG processes,
our paper contains a wealth of results about the long time behaviour of (uniformly) hypoelliptic
processes which are non-ergodic, in the sense that they exhibit multiple invariant measures.
