The problem of identifying a planted assignment given a random $k$-SAT formula consistent with
the assignment exhibits a large algorithmic gap: while the planted solution becomes unique and
can be identified given a formula with $O(n\log n)$ clauses, there are distributions over clauses
for which the best known efficient algorithms require $n^{k/2}$ clauses. We propose and study a
unified model for planted $k$-SAT, which captures well-known special cases. An instance is described
by a planted assignment $\sigma$ and a distribution on clauses with $k$ literals. We define its distribution
complexity as the largest $r$ for which the distribution is not $r$-wise independent ($1 \le r \le
k$ for any distribution with a planted assignment). Our main result is an unconditional lower bound,
tight up to logarithmic factors, for statistical (query) algorithms [Kearns 1998, Feldman et.
al 2012], matching known upper bounds, which, as we show, can be implemented using a statistical
algorithm. Since known approaches for problems over distributions have statistical analogues
(spectral, MCMC, gradient-based, convex optimization etc.), this lower bound provides a rigorous
explanation of the observed algorithmic gap. The proof introduces a new general technique for the
analysis of statistical query algorithms. It also points to a geometric paring phenomenon in the
space of all planted assignments. We describe consequences of our lower bounds to Feige's refutation
hypothesis [Feige 2002] and to lower bounds on general convex programs that solve planted $k$-SAT.
Our bounds also extend to other planted $k$-CSP models, and, in particular, provide concrete evidence
for the security of Goldreich's one-way function and the associated pseudorandom generator when
used with a sufficiently hard predicate [Goldreich 2000].
