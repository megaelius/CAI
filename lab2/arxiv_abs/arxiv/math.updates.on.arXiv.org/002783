The general ability to analyze and classify the 3D kinematics of the human form is an essential step
in the development of socially adept humanoid robots. A variety of different types of signals can
be used by machines to represent and characterize actions such as RGB videos, infrared maps, and
optical flow. In particular, skeleton sequences provide a natural 3D kinematic description of
human motions and can be acquired in real time using RGB+D cameras. Moreover, skeleton sequences
are generalizable to characterize the motions of both humans and humanoid robots. The Globally
Optimal Reparameterization Algorithm (GORA) is a novel, recently proposed algorithm for signal
alignment in which signals are reparameterized to a globally optimal universal standard timescale
(UST). Here, we introduce a variant of GORA for humanoid action recognition with skeleton sequences,
which we call GORA-S. We briefly review the algorithm's mathematical foundations and contextualize
them in the problem of action recognition with skeleton sequences. Subsequently, we introduce
GORA-S and discuss parameters and numerical techniques for its effective implementation. We then
compare its performance with that of the DTW and FastDTW algorithms, in terms of computational efficiency
and accuracy in matching skeletons. Our results show that GORA-S attains a complexity that is significantly
less than that of any tested DTW method. In addition, it displays a favorable balance between speed
and accuracy that remains invariant under changes in skeleton sampling frequency, lending it a
degree of versatility that could make it well-suited for a variety of action recognition tasks.
