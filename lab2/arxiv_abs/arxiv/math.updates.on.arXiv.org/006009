We prove a new effective Chebotarev density theorem for Galois extensions $L/\mathbb{Q}$ that
allows one to count small primes (even as small as an arbitrarily small power of the discriminant
of $L$); this theorem holds for the Galois closures of "almost all" number fields that lie in an appropriate
family of field extensions. Previously, applying Chebotarev in such small ranges required assuming
the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. The error term in this new Chebotarev density theorem also
avoids the effect of an exceptional zero of the Dedekind zeta function of $L$, without assuming GRH.
We give many different "appropriate families," including families of arbitrarily large degree.
To do this, we first prove a new effective Chebotarev density theorem that requires a zero-free region
of the Dedekind zeta function. Then we prove that almost all number fields in our families yield such
a zero-free region. The innovation that allows us to achieve this is a delicate new method for controlling
zeroes of certain families of non-cuspidal $L$-functions. This builds on, and greatly generalizes
the applicability of, work of Kowalski and Michel on the average density of zeroes of a family of cuspidal
$L$-functions. A surprising feature of this new method, which we expect will have independent interest,
is that we control the number of zeroes in the family of $L$-functions by bounding the number of certain
associated fields with fixed discriminant. As an application of the new Chebotarev density theorem,
we prove the first nontrivial upper bounds for $\ell$-torsion in class groups, for all integers
$\ell \geq 1$, applicable to infinite families of fields of arbitrarily large degree.
