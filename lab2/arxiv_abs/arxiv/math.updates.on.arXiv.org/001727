If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables with distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$ then $U=\psi(X,Y)$
and $V=\phi(X,Y)$ are also independent for some $\psi$ and $\phi$. Properties of this type are known
for many important probability distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$. Also related characterization
questions have been widely investigated: Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent and let $U$ and $V$ be independent.
Are the distributions of $X$ and $Y$ $\mu$ and $\nu$, respectively? Recently two new properties
and characterizations of this kind involving the Kummer distribution appeared in the literature.
For independent $X$ and $Y$ with gamma and Kummer distributions Koudou and Vallois observed that
$U=(1+(X+Y)^{-1})/(1+X^{-1})$ and $V=X+Y$ are also independent, and Hamza and Vallois observed
that $U=Y/(1+X)$ and $V=X(1+Y/(1+X))$ are independent. In 2011 and 2012 Koudou, Vallois characterizations
related to the first property were proved, while the characterizations in the second setting have
been recently given in Piliszek, Weso{\l}owski (2016). In both cases technical assumptions on
smoothness properties of densities of $X$ and $Y$ were needed. In 2015, the assumption of independence
of $U$ and $V$ in the first setting was weakened to constancy of regressions of $U$ and $U^{-1}$ given
$V$ with no density assumptions. However, the additional assumption $\mathbb{E} X^{-1}<\infty$
was introduced. In the present paper we provide a complete answer to the characterization question
in both settings without any additional technical assumptions regarding smoothness or existence
of moments. The approach is, first, via characterizations exploiting some conditions imposed
on regressions of $U$ given $V$, which are weaker than independence, but for which moment assumptions
are necessary. Second, using a technique of change of measure we show that the moment assumptions
can be avoided.
