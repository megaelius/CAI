A weakly complete vector space over $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ is isomorphic
to $\mathbb{K}^X$ for some set $X$ algebraically and topologically. The significance of this type
of topological vector spaces is illustrated by the fact that the underlying vector space of the Lie
algebra of any pro-Lie group is weakly complete. In this study, weakly complete real or complex associative
algebras are studied because they are necessarily projective limits of finite dimensional algebras.
The group of units $A^{-1}$ of a weakly complete algebra $A$ is a pro-Lie group with the associated
topological Lie algebra $A_{\rm Lie}$ of $A$ as Lie algebra and the globally defined exponential
function $\exp\colon A\to A^{-1}$ as the exponential function of $A^{-1}$. With each topological
group, a weakly complete group algebra $\mathbb{K}[G]$ is associated functorially so that the
functor $G\mapsto \mathbb{K}[G]$ is left adjoint to $A\mapsto A^{-1}$. The group algebra $\mathbb{K}[G]$
is a weakly complete Hopf algebra. If $G$ is compact, the $\mathbb{R}[G]$ contains $G$ as the set
of grouplike elements. The category of all real Hopf algebras $A$ with a compact group of grouplike
elements whose linear span is dense in $A$ is shown to be equivalent to the category of compact groups.
The group algebra $A=\mathbb{R}[G]$ of a compact group $G$ contains a copy of the Lie algebra $\mathcal{L}(G)$
in $A_{\rm Lie}$; it also contains a copy of the Radon measure algebra $M(G,\mathbb{R})$. The dual
of the group algebra $\mathbb{R}[G]$ is the Hopf algebra ${\mathcal R}(G,\mathbb{R})$ of representative
functions of $G$. The rather straightforward duality between vector spaces and weakly complete
vector spaces thus becomes the basis of a duality ${\mathcal R}(G,\mathbb{R})\leftrightarrow
\mathbb{R}[G]$ and thus yields a new aspect of Tannaka duality.
