It is known that for any finite/co-finite set of primes there exists a network which has a rate $1$
solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set. We generalize
this result to show that for any positive rational number $k/n$, and for any given finite/co-finite
set of primes, there exists a network which has a rate $k/n$ fractional linear network coding solution
if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set. For this purpose we
construct two networks: $\mathcal{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{N}_2$; the network $\mathcal{N}_1$ has
a $k/n$ fractional linear network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite
field belongs to the given finite set of primes, and the network $\mathcal{N}_2$ has a $k/n$ fractional
linear network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the
given co-finite set of primes. Recently, a method has been introduced where characteristic-dependent
linear rank inequalities are produced from networks whose linear coding capacity depends on the
characteristic of the finite field. By employing this method on the networks $\mathcal{N}_1$ and
$\mathcal{N}_2$, we construct two classes of characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities.
For any given set of primes, the first class contains an inequality which holds if the characteristic
of the finite field does not belong to the given set of primes but may not hold otherwise; the second
class contains an inequality which holds if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the
given set of primes but may not hold otherwise. We then use these inequalities to obtain an upper-bound
on the linear coding capacity of $\mathcal{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{N}_2$.
