Future wireless networks are expected to constitute a distributed intelligent wireless communications,
sensing, and computing platform, which will have the challenging requirement of interconnecting
the physical and digital worlds in a seamless and sustainable manner. Currently, two main factors
prevent wireless network operators from building such networks: 1) the lack of control of the wireless
environment, whose impact on the radio waves cannot be customized, and 2) the current operation
of wireless radios, which consume a lot of power because new signals are generated whenever data
has to be transmitted. In this paper, we challenge the usual "more data needs more power and emission
of radio waves" status quo, and motivate that future wireless networks necessitate a smart radio
environment: A transformative wireless concept, where the environmental objects are coated with
artificial thin films of electromagnetic and reconfigurable material (that are referred to as
intelligent reconfigurable meta-surfaces), which are capable of sensing the environment and
of applying customized transformations to the radio waves. Smart radio environments have the potential
to provide future wireless networks with uninterrupted wireless connectivity, and with the capability
of transmitting data without generating new signals but recycling existing radio waves. This paper
overviews the current research efforts on smart radio environments, the enabling technologies
to realize them in practice, the need of new communication-theoretic models for their analysis
and design, and the long-term and open research issues to be solved towards their massive deployment.
In a nutshell, this paper is focused on discussing how the availability of intelligent reconfigurable
meta-surfaces will allow wireless network operators to redesign common and well-known network
communication paradigms.
