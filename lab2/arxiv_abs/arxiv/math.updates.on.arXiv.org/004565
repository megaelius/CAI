In this paper, we study the multi-server setting of the \emph{Private Information Retrieval with
Coded Side Information (PIR-CSI)} problem. In this problem, there are $K$ messages replicated
across $N$ servers, and there is a user who wishes to download one message from the servers without
revealing any information to any server about the identity of the requested message. The user has
a side information which is a linear combination of a subset of $M$ messages in the database. The parameter
$M$ is known to all servers in advance, whereas the indices and the coefficients of the messages in
the user's side information are unknown to any server \emph{a priori}. We focus on a class of PIR-CSI
schemes, referred to as \emph{server-symmetric schemes}, in which the queries/answers to/from
different servers are symmetric in structure. We define the \emph{rate} of a PIR-CSI scheme as its
minimum download rate among all problem instances, and define the \emph{server-symmetric capacity}
of the PIR-CSI problem as the supremum of rates over all server-symmetric PIR-CSI schemes. Our main
results are as follows: (i) when the side information is not a function of the user's requested message,
the capacity is given by ${(1+{1}/{N}+\dots+{1}/{N^{\left\lceil \frac{K}{M+1}\right\rceil
-1}})^{-1}}$ for any ${1\leq M\leq K-1}$; and (ii) when the side information is a function of the
user's requested message, the capacity is equal to $1$ for $M=2$ and $M=K$, and it is equal to ${N}/{(N+1)}$
for any ${3 \leq M \leq K-1}$. The converse proofs rely on new information-theoretic arguments,
and the achievability schemes are inspired by our recently proposed scheme for single-server PIR-CSI
as well as the Sun-Jafar scheme for multi-server PIR.
