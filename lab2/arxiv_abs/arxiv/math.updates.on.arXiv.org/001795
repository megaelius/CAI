Using recently introduced Debord-Skandalis Blup's groupoids we study index theory for a compact
foliated manifold with boundary inducing a foliation in its boundary. For this we consider first
a blup groupoid whose Lie algebroid has sections consisting of vector fields tangent to the leaves
in the interior and tangent to the leaves of the foliation in the boundary. In particular the holonomy
$b$-groupoid allows us to consider the appropriate pseudodifferential calculus and the appropriate
index problems. In this paper we further use the blup groupoids, and in particular its functoriality
properties, to actually get index theorems. For the previous geometric situtation there are two
index morphisms, one related to ellipticity and a second one related to fully ellipticity (generalized
Fredholmness). For the first we are able to extend the longitudinal Connes-Skandalis index theorem
and use it to get that every $b$-longitudinal elliptic operator can be perturbed (up to stable homotopy)
with a regularizing operator in the calculus to get a fully elliptic operator. For the second index
morphism, the one related to fully elliptic operators, we restrict ourselves to the case of families
of manifolds with boundary (particular case of foliatons as above) and we prove a new K-theoretical
index theorem, i.e. construct a topological index and prove the equality with the analytic-Fredholm
index, and use it to get a cohomological index formula for every fully elliptic operator. In particular,
for a perturbed (or with a choice of a spectral section) family of generalized Dirac operators we
can compare our formula with the one by Melrose-Piazza to get a new geometric expression for the eta
form of the family.
