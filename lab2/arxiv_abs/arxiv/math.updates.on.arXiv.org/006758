We develop an untyped semantic framework for the multiverse of set theory and show that its proof-theoretic
commitments are mild. $\mathsf{ZF}$ is extended with semantical axioms utilizing the new symbols
$\mathsf{M}(\mathcal{U})$ and $\mathsf{Mod}(\mathcal{U, \sigma})$, expressing that $\mathcal{U}$
is a universe and that $\sigma$ is true in the universe $\mathcal{U}$, respectively. Here $\sigma$
ranges over the augmented language, leading to liar-style phenomena that are analysed. The framework
is both compatible with a broad range of multiverse conceptions and suggests its own philosophically
and semantically motivated multiverse principles. In particular, the framework is closely linked
with a deductive rule of Necessitation to the effect that the multiverse theory can only prove statements
that it also proves to hold in all universes. We argue that this may be philosophically thought of
as a {\em Copernican principle} that the background theory does not hold a privileged position over
the theories of its internal universes. Our main mathematical result shows that, for a range of semantical
principles, the framework's proof-theoretic commitments are very mild, and thus not seriously
limiting to the diversity of the set-theoretic multiverse. Considering truth-in-all-universes
as an interpetation of the modal $\square$-operator, we show that our main semantical theory is
consistent with the modal logics $\mathsf{T}$ and G\"odel-L\"ob provability logic, but not with
$\mathsf{S4}$. We conclude with case studies applying the framework to two multiverse conceptions
of set theory: arithmetic absoluteness and Joel D. Hamkins' multiverse theory.
