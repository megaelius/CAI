It is well known that excessive harvesting or hunting has driven species to extinction both on local
and global scales. This leads to one of the fundamental problems of conservation ecology: how should
we harvest a population so that economic gain is maximized, while also ensuring that the species
is safe from extinction? We study an ecosystem of interacting species that are influenced by random
environmental fluctuations. At any point in time, we can either harvest or seed (repopulate) species.
Harvesting brings an economic gain while seeding incurs a cost. The problem is to find the optimal
harvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from harvesting minus the
cost one has to pay for the seeding of various species. We consider what happens when one, or both,
of the seeding and harvesting rates are bounded. The focus of this paper is the analysis of these three
novel settings: bounded seeding and infinite harvesting, bounded seeding and bounded harvesting,
and infinite seeding and bounded harvesting. We prove analytical results and develop numerical
approximation methods. By implementing these approximations, we are able to gain qualitative
information about how to best harvest and seed species. We are able to show that in the single species
setting there are thresholds $0<L_1<L_2<\infty$ such that: 1) if the population size is `low',
so that it lies in $(0, L_1]$, there is seeding using the maximal seeding rate; 2) if the population
size `moderate', so that it lies in $(L_1,L_2)$, there is no harvesting or seeding; 3) if the population
size is `high', so that it lies in the interval $[L_2, \infty)$, there is harvesting using the maximal
harvesting rate. Once we have a system with at least two species, numerical experiments show that
constant threshold strategies are not optimal anymore.
