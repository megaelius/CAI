There are many classical random walk in random environment results that apply to ergodic random
planar environments. We extend some of these results to random environments in which the length
scale varies from place to place, so that the law of the environment is in a certain sense only translation
invariant modulo scaling. For our purposes, an "environment" consists of an infinite random planar
map embedded in $\mathbb C$, each of whose edges comes with a positive real conductance. Our main
result is that under modest constraints (translation invariance modulo scaling together with
the finiteness of a type of specific energy) a random walk in this kind of environment converges to
Brownian motion modulo time parameterization in the quenched sense. Environments of the type considered
here arise naturally in the study of random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity. In fact, the
results of this paper are used in separate works to prove that certain random planar maps (embedded
in the plane via the so-called Tutte embedding) have scaling limits given by SLE-decorated Liouville
quantum gravity, and also to provide a more explicit construction of Brownian motion on the Brownian
map. However, the results of this paper are much more general and can be read independently of that
program. One general consequence of our main result is that if a translation invariant (modulo scaling)
random embedded planar map and its dual have finite energy per area, then they are close on large scales
to a minimal energy embedding (the harmonic embedding). To establish Brownian motion convergence
for an infinite energy embedding, it suffices to show that one can perturb it to make the energy finite.
