Immune interventions consisting in repeated injection are broadly used as they are thought to improve
the quantity and the quality of the immune response. However, they also raised several questions
that remains unanswered, in particular the number of injections to make or the delay to respect between
different injections to acheive this goal. Practical and financial considerations add constraints
to these questions, especially in the framework of human studies. We specifically focus here on
the use of interleukine-7 (IL-7) injections in HIV-infected patients under antiretroviral treatment,
but still unable to restore normal levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Clinical trials have already shown
that repeated cycles of injections of IL-7 could help maintaining CD4+ T lymphocytes levels over
the limit of 500 cells per microL, by affecting proliferation and survival of CD4+ T cells. We then
aim at answering the question : how to maintain a patient's level of CD4+ T lymphocytes by using a minimum
number of injections (ie optimizing the strategy of injections) ? Based on mechanistic models that
were previously developed for the dynamics of CD4+ T lymphocytes in this context, we model the process
by a piecewise deterministic Markov model. We then address the question by using some recently established
theory on impulse control problem in order to develop a numerical tool determining the optimal strategy.
Results are obtained on a reduced model, as a proof of concept : the method allows to defined an optimal
strategy for a given patient. This method could applied to optimize injections schedules in clinical
trials.
