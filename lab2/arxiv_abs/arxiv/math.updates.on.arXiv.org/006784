Let $D\subset\mathbb C^n$ be a bounded, strongly pseudoconvex domain whose boundary $bD$ satisfies
the minimal regularity condition of class $C^2$. We characterize boundedness and compactness
in $L^p(bD, \omega)$, for $1<p<\infty$, of the commutator $[b, \EuScript S_\omega]$ where $\EuScript
S_\omega$ is the Cauchy--Szeg\H{o} (orthogonal) projection of $L^2(bD, \omega)$ onto the holomorphic
Hardy space $H^2(bD, \omega)$ and the measure $\omega$ belongs to a family (the "Leray Levi-like"
measures) that includes induced Lebesgue measure $\sigma$. We next consider a much larger family
of measures $\{\Omega\}$ modeled after the Muckenhoupt weights for $\sigma$: we define the holomorphic
Hardy spaces $H^p(bD, \Omega)$ for any $A_p$-like measure $\Omega$ and we characterize boundedness
and compactness of $[b,\EuScript S_\Omega]$ in $L^2(bD, \Omega)$ for any $A_2$-like measure $\Omega$.
Earlier closely related results rely upon an asymptotic expansion, and subsequent pointwise estimates,
of the Cauchy--Szeg\H o kernel that are not available in the settings of minimal regularity {of $bD$}
and/or $A_p$-like measures. Among the new main tools are (1) operator identities for $[b, \EuScript
S_\omega]$ and for $[b, \EuScript S_\Omega]$ inspired by the classical Kerzman--Stein equation
for $\EuScript S_\sigma$ in $L^2(bD, \sigma)$ and its 2017 variant in $L^p (bD, \omega)$, where
$p\neq 2$; (2) sharp weighted estimates in $L^p(bD, \Omega)$ for a family of Cauchy type integral
operators $\{\EuScript C_\epsilon\}_\epsilon$ and for their commutators $\{[b, \EuScript C_\epsilon]\}_\epsilon$;
(3) cancellation estimates in $L^p(bD, \Omega)$ for the symmetrized truncation of the aforementioned
$\{\EuScript C_\epsilon\}_\epsilon$ with quantitative norm bounds displaying explicit dependence
on $\epsilon$.
