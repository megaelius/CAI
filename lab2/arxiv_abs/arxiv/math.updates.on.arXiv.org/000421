Asymptotic representation theory of general linear groups GL(n,q) over a finite field leads to
studying probability measures \rho on the group U of all infinite uni-uppertriangular matrices
over F_q, with the condition that \rho is invariant under conjugations by arbitrary infinite matrices.
Such probability measures form an infinite-dimensional simplex, and the description of its extreme
points (in other words, ergodic measures \rho) was conjectured by Kerov in connection with nonnegative
specializations of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. Vershik and Kerov also conjectured
the following Law of Large Numbers. Consider an n by n diagonal submatrix of the infinite random matrix
drawn from an ergodic measure coming from the Kerov's conjectural classification. The sizes of
Jordan blocks of the submatrix can be interpreted as a (random) partition of n, or, equivalently,
as a (random) Young diagram \lambda(n) with n boxes. Then, as n goes to infinity, the rows and columns
of \lambda(n) have almost sure limiting frequencies corresponding to parameters of this ergodic
measure. Our main result is the proof of this Law of Large Numbers. We achieve it by analyzing a new
randomized Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) insertion algorithm which samples random Young diagrams
\lambda(n) coming from ergodic measures. The probability weights of these Young diagrams are expressed
in terms of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. Our insertion algorithm is a modified and extended
version of a recent construction by Borodin and the second author ( arXiv:1305.5501 ). On the other
hand, our randomized RSK insertion generalizes a version of the RSK insertion introduced by Vershik
and Kerov (1986) in connection with asymptotic representation theory of symmetric groups (which
is governed by nonnegative specializations of Schur symmetric functions).
