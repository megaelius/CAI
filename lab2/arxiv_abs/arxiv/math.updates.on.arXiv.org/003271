Motivated by our previous work on hypergeometric functions and the parbelos constant, we perform
a deeper investigation on the interplay among generalized complete elliptic integrals, Fourier-Legendre
(FL) series expansions, and ${}_p F_q$ series. We explore the closed-form evaluation of series
containing squared central binomial coefficients and binomial products of the form $\binom{4n}
{2n}\binom{2n}{n}$ through the use of Legendre-type functions and complete elliptic integrals,
and we introduce two different algorithmic approaches for the explicit evaluation of hypergeometric
functions with quarter-integer parameters. Using the generating function for shifted Legendre
polynomials, we prove that the generalized complete elliptic integrals $\mathfrak{J_m}$ have
both a hypergeometric Taylor series at the origin and an FL expansion with a hypergeometric structure,
and we use this to show how moments of the form $\int_{0}^{1}x^\eta \mathfrak{J}_m(x)\,dx$ may
be expressed in terms of ${}_3 F_2$ functions. Through a creative application of FL theory together
with new integration results involving complete elliptic integrals, we prove a variety of new results
on $\frac{1}{\pi}$ series, such as the elegant harmonic-binomial series formula $$ \sum _{n = 0}^{\infty
} \binom{2 n}{n}^2 \frac{H_{n + \frac{1}{4}}-H_{n-\frac{1}{4}}}{16^{n} } = \frac{\Gamma^4
\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{8 \pi^2}-\frac{4 G}{\pi}, $$ along with the double series formula
$$ \sum _{m, n \geq 0} \frac{\binom{2 m}{m}^2 \binom{2 n}{n}^2 }{ 16^{m + n} (m+n+1) (2 m+3) } = \frac{7
\zeta (3) - 4 G}{\pi^2}.$$ We introduce new methods for deriving closed-form evaluations for a variety
of different classes of hypergeometric series through the use of FL expansions and related integration
techniques.
