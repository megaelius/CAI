Shannon's sampling theorem is one of the cornerstone topics that is well understood and explored,
both mathematically and algorithmically. That said, practical realization of this theorem still
suffers from a severe bottleneck due to the fundamental assumption that the samples can span an arbitrary
range of amplitudes. In practice, the theorem is realized using so-called analog-to-digital converters
(ADCs) which clip or saturate whenever the signal amplitude exceeds the maximum recordable ADC
voltage thus leading to a significant information loss. In this paper, we develop an alternative
paradigm for sensing and recovery, called the Unlimited Sampling Framework. It is based on the observation
that when a signal is mapped to an appropriate bounded interval via a modulo operation before entering
the ADC, the saturation problem no longer exists, but one rather encounters a different type of information
loss due to the modulo operation. Such an alternative setup can be implemented, for example, via
so-called folding or self-reset ADCs, as they have been proposed in various contexts in the circuit
design literature. The key task that we need to accomplish in order to cope with this new type of information
loss is to recover a bandlimited signal from its modulo samples. In this paper we derive conditions
when this is possible and present an empirically stable recovery algorithm with guaranteed perfect
recovery. The sampling density required for recovery is independent of the maximum recordable
ADC voltage and depends on the signal bandwidth only. Numerical experiments validate our approach
and indeed show that it is possible to perfectly recover functions that take values that are orders
of magnitude higher than the ADC's threshold. Applications of the unlimited sampling paradigm
can be found in a number of fields such as signal processing, communication and imaging.
