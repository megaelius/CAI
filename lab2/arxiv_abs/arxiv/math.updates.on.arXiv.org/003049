This paper presents a robust, adaptive numerical scheme for simulating high density ratio and high
shear multiphase flows on locally refined Cartesian grids that adapt to the evolving interfaces
and track regions of high vorticity. The algorithm combines the interface capturing level set method
with a variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes solver that is demonstrated to stably
resolve material contrast ratios of up to six orders of magnitude. The discretization approach
ensures second-order pointwise accuracy for both velocity and pressure with several physical
boundary treatments, including velocity and traction boundary conditions. The paper includes
several test cases that demonstrate the order of accuracy and algorithmic scalability of the flow
solver. To ensure the stability of the numerical scheme in the presence of high density and viscosity
ratios, we employ a consistent treatment of mass and momentum transport in the conservative form
of discrete equations. This consistency is achieved by solving an additional mass balance equation,
which we approximate via a strong stability preserving Runga-Kutta time integrator and by employing
the same mass flux (obtained from the mass equation) in the discrete momentum equation. The scheme
uses higher-order total variation diminishing (TVD) and convection-boundedness criterion (CBC)
satisfying limiter to avoid numerical fluctuations in the transported density field. The high-order
bounded convective transport is done on a dimension-by-dimension basis, which makes the scheme
simple to implement. We also demonstrate through several test cases that the lack of consistent
mass and momentum transport in non-conservative formulations, which are commonly used in practice,
or the use of non-CBC satisfying limiters can yield very large numerical error and very poor accuracy
for convection-dominant high density ratio flows.
