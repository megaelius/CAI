Scott proved that if $\Sigma$ is a closed surface with a hyperbolic metric $\rho$, then for every
closed geodesic $\gamma$ on $\Sigma$ there exists a finite cover of $\Sigma$ where $\gamma$ lifts
to a simple closed geodesic. Define $f_\rho(L)\ge 0$ to be the smallest monotone nondecreasing
function such that every closed geodesic of length $\le L$ on $\Sigma$ lifts to a simple closed geodesic
in a cover of $\Sigma$ of degree $\le f_\rho(L)$. A result of Patel implies that for every hyperbolic
structure $\rho$ on $\Sigma$ there exists $K=K(\rho)>0$ such that $f_\rho(L)\le KL$ for all
$L>0$. We prove that there exist $c=c(\rho)>0$ such that $f_\rho(L)\ge c \log^{1/3} L$ for
all sufficiently large $L$. We obtain a similar lower bound for the function $f_\Sigma$ defined
analogously to $f_\rho$ but using the self-intersection number of closed curves on $\Sigma$. These
results are derived from several related results we establish for free groups. Thus we define, study
and obtain lower bounds for the "primitivity index function" $f(n)$ and the "simplicity index function"
$f_0(n)$ for the free group $F_N=F(a_1,\dots, a_N)$ of finite rank $N\ge 2$. The primitivity index
function $f(n)$ is the smallest monotone non-decreasing function $f(n)\ge 0$ such that for every
nontrivial freely reduced word $w\in F_N$ of length $\le n$ there is a subgroup $H\le F_N$ of index
$\le f(n)$ such that $w\in H$ and that $w$ is a primitive element (i.e. an element of a free basis) of
$H$. The function $f_0(n)$ is defined similarly except that instead of $w$ being primitive in $H$
we require that $w$ belongs to a proper free factor of $H$. The lower bounds for $f(n)$ and $f_0(n)$
are obtained via probabilistic methods, by estimating from below the \emph{simplicity index}
for a "sufficiently random" element $w_n\in F_N$ produced by a simple non-backtracking random
walk of length $n$ on $F_N$.
