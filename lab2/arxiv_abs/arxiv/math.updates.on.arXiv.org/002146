Given a sample of bids from independent auctions, this paper examines the question of inference
on auction fundamentals (e.g. valuation distributions, welfare measures) under weak assumptions
on information structure. The question is important as it allows us to learn about the valuation
distribution in a robust way, i.e., without assuming that a particular information structure holds
across observations. We leverage the recent contributions of \cite{Bergemann2013} in the robust
mechanism design literature that exploit the link between Bayesian Correlated Equilibria and
Bayesian Nash Equilibria in incomplete information games to construct an econometrics framework
for learning about auction fundamentals using observed data on bids. We showcase our construction
of identified sets in private value and common value auctions. Our approach for constructing these
sets inherits the computational simplicity of solving for correlated equilibria: checking whether
a particular valuation distribution belongs to the identified set is as simple as determining whether
a {\it linear} program is feasible. A similar linear program can be used to construct the identified
set on various welfare measures and counterfactual objects. For inference and to summarize statistical
uncertainty, we propose novel finite sample methods using tail inequalities that are used to construct
confidence regions on sets. We also highlight methods based on Bayesian bootstrap and subsampling.
A set of Monte Carlo experiments show adequate finite sample properties of our inference procedures.
We illustrate our methods using data from OCS auctions.
