The paper considers a coupled system of linear Boltzmann transport equations (BTE), and its Continuous
Slowing Down Approximation (CSDA). This system can be used to model the relevant transport of particles
used e.g. in dose calculation in radiation therapy. The evolution of charged particles (e.g. electrons
and positrons) are in practice often modelled using the CSDA version of BTE because of the so-called
forward peakedness of scattering events contributing to the particle fluencies (or particle densities),
which causes severe problems in numerical methods. We shall find, after the preliminary treatments,
that for some interactions CSDA-type modelling is actually necessary due to hyper-singularities
in the differential cross-sections of certain interactions, that is, first or second order partial
derivatives with respect to energy and angle must be included into the transport part of charged
particles. The existence and uniqueness of (weak) solutions is shown, under sufficient criteria
and in appropriate $L^2$-based spaces, for a single (particle) CSDA-equation by using three techniques,
the Lions-Lax-Milgram Theorem (variational approach), the theory of $m$-dissipative operators
and the theory evolution operators (semigroup approach). The due a priori estimates are derived
and the positivity of solutions are retrieved. In addition, we prove the corresponding results
and estimates for the system of coupled transport equations. The related existence results are
given for the adjoint problem as well. We also give some computational points (e.g. certain explicit
formulas), and we outline a related inverse problem at the end of the paper.
