A spectral study of power-map deformed singular random correlation matrices is presented in this
paper. The study is inspired from the multivariate analysis of large dimensional datasets where
stationarity or quasi-stationarity could often be a good approximation for a non-stationary time
series only over a short time horizon. Correlation matrices estimated over such short time horizons
are singular, with a significant portion of the spectrum falling exactly on zero. The power map has
been proposed to remove this spectral degeneracy, where the correlation matrix is deformed as soon
as the exponent is varied from one. Importance of the power map has been illustrated for the singular
matrices encountered in financial application, viz. the portfolio optimization. To get a clearer
picture of deformed matrices, the exponent of the power map has been chosen to be very close to one
such that the emerging spectrum corresponding to the zeros of the original spectrum falls into a
gap between zero and nonzero part of the entire spectrum. Analytical approximate estimate of the
first and the second moments for the emerging spectra have been calculated for the deformed Wishart
matrices of random matrix theory. Furthermore, the study has been extended to the correlated Wishart
ensembles with two examples, viz. when the true correlation matrix has block-diagonal structure
while in the second example it has a smooth band profile off the diagonal. In both cases the spectra
have been analyzed numerically using the analytical results as a benchmark situation. It is shown
that the emerging spectra are sensitive to the true correlation.
