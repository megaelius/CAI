We introduce a notion of $\lambda$-graph bisystem. It consists of a pair $({\frak L}^-, {\frak L}^+)$
of two labeled Bratteli diagrams ${\frak L}^-, {\frak L}^+$ over alphabets $\Sigma^-, \Sigma^+$,
respectively, and satisfy certain compatibility condition of their labeling on edges. Its matrix
presentation is called a symbolic matrix bisystem. We first show that any $\lambda$-graph bisystem
presents subshifts and conversely any subshift is presented by a $\lambda$-graph bisystem, called
the canonical $\lambda$-graph bisystem for the subshift. We introduce a notion of properly strong
shift equivalence on symbolic matrix bisystems and show that two subshifts are topologically conjugate
if and only if their canonical symbolic matrix bisystems are properly strong shift equivalent.
A $\lambda$-graph bisystem $({\frak L}^-, {\frak L}^+)$ yields a pair of $C^*$-algebra written
${{\mathcal{O}}_{{\frak L}^-}^+}, {{\mathcal{O}}_{{\frak L}^+}^-}$. We show that the $C^*$-algebras
are universal unique $C^*$-algebras subject to certain operator relations among canonical generators
encoded by $\lambda$-graph bisystem $({\frak L}^-, {\frak L}^+).$ If a $\lambda$-graph bisystem
comes from a $\lambda$-graph system of a finite directed graph, then the associated subshift is
the two-sided topological Markov shift $(\Lambda_A, \sigma_A)$ by its transition matrix $A$ of
the graph, and the associated $C^*$-algebra ${{\mathcal{O}}_{{\frak L}^-}^+}$ is isomorphic
to ${\mathcal{O}}_A,$ whereas the other $C^*$-algebra ${{\mathcal{O}}_{{\frak L}^+}^-}$ is
isomorphic to $C(\Lambda_A)\rtimes_{\sigma_A^*}\mathbb{Z}$ of the commutative $C^*$-algebra
$C(\Lambda_A)$ on $\Lambda_A$ by the automorphism induced by the homeomorphism of the shift $\sigma_A.$
This phenomena shows a duality between ${\mathcal{O}}_A$ and $C(\Lambda_A)\rtimes_{\sigma_A^*}\mathbb{Z}$.
