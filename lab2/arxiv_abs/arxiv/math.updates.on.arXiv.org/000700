Using a simple rotate-and-sum procedure, we construct and solve exactly a random matrix model with
peculiar features. It is invariant under the standard symmetry groups (orthogonal and unitary)
and yet the interaction between eigenvalues is not Vandermondian. The ensemble contains real symmetric
or complex hermitian matrices $\mathbf{S}$ of the form $\mathbf{S}=\sum_{i=1}^M \langle \mathbf{O}_i
\mathbf{D}_i\mathbf{O}_i^{\mathrm{T}}\rangle$ or $\mathbf{S}=\sum_{i=1}^M \langle \mathbf{U}_i
\mathbf{D}_i\mathbf{U}_i^\dagger\rangle$ respectively. The diagonal matrices $\mathbf{D}_i=\mathrm{diag}\{\lambda_1^{(i)},\ldots,\lambda_N^{(i)}\}$
are constructed from real eigenvalues drawn independently from distributions $p^{(i)}(x)$,
while the matrices $\mathbf{O}_i$ and $\mathbf{U}_i$ are all orthogonal or unitary and the average
$\langle\cdot\rangle$ is performed over the respective group. While the original matrices $\mathbf{D}_i$
do not exhibit level repulsion, the resulting sum $\mathbf{S}$ develops it upon averaging over
multiple $(M\geq 2)$ uncorrelated rotations. We focus on the cases where $p^{(i)}(x)$ is A.) a semicircle
law, or B.) a Gaussian law for all $i=1,\ldots,M$. For the choice A, in the limit $N\to\infty$ this
ensemble appears spectrally indistinguishable from the standard GOE or GUE, having same spectral
density, two-point correlation function, and nearest-neighbor spacing distribution $p(s)$
after unfolding. However, working out the case $N=2$ in detail, we uncover a universal (independent
of the $p^{(i)}(x)$) but different from Wigner-Dyson behavior as $s\to 0^+$. The generic interaction
between eigenvalues of $\mathbf{S}$ is indeed not precisely Vandermondian, despite the rotationally
invariant nature of the ensemble, and classical RMT universality is restored only asymptotically.
