A proper vertex coloring of a graph is a mapping of its vertices on a set of colors, such that two adjacent
vertices are not mapped to the same color. This constraint may be interpreted in terms of the distance
between to vertices and so a more general coloring concept can be defined: The strong coloring of
a graph. So a k-strong coloring is a coloring where two vertices may not have the same color if their
distance to each other is at most k. The 2-strong coloring of the line graph is known as the strong edge
coloring. Coloring the kth power G^k of a graph G is the same as finding a k-strong coloring of G itself.
In order to obtain a graph class on which the 2-strong coloring becomes efficiently solvable we are
looking for a structure that produces induced cycles in the square of G, so that by excluding this
structure we obtain a graph class with chordal squares, where a chordal graph is a graph without any
induced cycles of length at least 4. Such a structure is called a flower. Another structure will be
found and explained, which is responsible for flowers to appear in the line graph of G: The sprouts.
With this graphs with chordal line graph squares are described as well. Some attempts in generalizing
those structures to obtain perfect graph squares are being made and the general concept of chordal
graph powers, i.e. the existence of a smallest power for which a graph becomes chordal, the power
of chordality is introduced in order to solve some coloring related NP-hard problems on graphs with
parameterized algorithms. Some connections to the famous parameter treewidth arise alongside
with some deeper connections between edge and vertex coloring.
