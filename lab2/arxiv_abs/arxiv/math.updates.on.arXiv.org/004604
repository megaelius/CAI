The relationship between division of labor and individuals' spatial behavior in social insect
colonies provides a useful context to study how social interactions influence the spreading of
agent (which could be information or virus) across distributed agent systems. In social insect
colonies, spatial heterogeneity associated with variations of individual task roles, affects
social contacts, and thus the way in which agent moves through social contact networks. We used an
Agent Based Model (ABM) to mimic three realistic scenarios of agent spreading in social insect colonies.
Our model suggests that individuals within a specific task interact more with consequences that
agent could potentially spread rapidly within that group, while agent spreads slower between task
groups. Our simulations show a strong linear relationship between the degree of spatial heterogeneity
and social contact rates, and that the spreading dynamics of agents follow a modified nonlinear
logistic growth model with varied transmission rates for different scenarios. Our work provides
an important insights on the dual-functionality of physical contacts. This dual-functionality
is often driven via variations of individual spatial behavior, and can have both inhibiting and
facilitating effects on agent transmission rates depending on environment. The results from our
proposed model not only provide important insights on mechanisms that generate spatial heterogeneity,
but also deepen our understanding of how social insect colonies balance the benefit and cost of physical
contacts on the agents' transmission under varied environmental conditions.
