The author introduces the Wythoff game with a pass, a variant of the classical Wythoff game. The latter
game is played with two piles of stones, and two players take turns removing stones from one or both
piles; when removing stones from both piles, the numbers of stones removed from each pile must be
equal. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner. An equivalent description of
the game is that a single chess queen is placed somewhere on a large grid of squares, and each player
can move the queen towards the upper left corner of the grid: leftward, upward, or to the upper left,
any number of steps. The winner is the player who moves the queen into the upper left corner. In Wythoff's
game with a pass, we modify the standard rules of the game so as to allow for a one-time pass, i.e., a
pass move which may be used at most once in a game, and not from a terminal position. Once the pass has
been used by either player, it is no longer available. The author discovered that, when a pass move
is available, the set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions (previsous player's position) of the Wythoff's
game with a pass is equal to $ T_0 \cup T_1\cup B -A$, where $T_0 = \{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=0 \}$,
$T_0 = \{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=1 \}$, $B$ is a finite subset of $\{(x,y): \mathcal{G}(x,y)=4
\}$, $A$ is a finite subset of $T_0$ and $\mathcal{G}$ is the Grundy number of the classical Wythoff
game. Here the size of $B$ is $6$, and the size of $A$ is $7$. According to the research of U.Blass and
A.S.Fraenkel, for a position $(x,y) \in T_1 $ there is always a position $(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})
\in T_0$ such that $\mid x- x^{\prime} \mid \leq 2$ and $\mid y - y^{\prime} \mid \leq 4$, and hence
the graph of the set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions of the Wythoff's game with a pass is very similar
to the graph of the set of $\mathcal{P}$-positions of the classical Wythoff's game.
