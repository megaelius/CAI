We deal with various classes of finitely generated semi-hyperbolic rational semigroups $G$ acting
on the Riemann sphere. Our primary tool is the associated skew product map $\tilde f$. For every real
number $t\ge 0$ we define the topological pressure $P(t)$ ascribed to the (possibly) unbounded
potential $-t\log|\tilde f'|$. We show that for some non-degenerate open (in $[0,+\infty)$) interval
containing $0$ and the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set $J(G)$, the function $t\mapsto P(t)$
is real-analytic. We further show that for all $t$ in such an interval there exist a unique $t$-conformal
measure $m_t$ and a unique Borel probability $\tilde f$-invariant measure $\mu_t$ absolutely
continuous with respect to $m_t$. We then show that $\mu_t$ and $m_t$ are equivalent measures and
that the dynamical system $(\tilde f,\mu_t)$ is metrically exact (thus ergodic), and that for H\"older
continuous observables $(\tilde f,\mu_t)$ satisfies the CLT, LIL, and the Exponential Decay of
Correlations. We prove a Variational Principle for the potentials $-t\log|\tilde f'|$, and we
characterize the measures $\mu_t$ as their unique equilibrium states. Concerning geometry, we
first introduce the Nice Open Set Condition, and we prove that each *semi-hyperbolic rational semigroup
satisfying this condition is of finite type. We then introduce the class of non-exceptional semigroups
and perform a full multifractal analysis of the equilibrium states $\mu_t$. In particular, we show
that the corresponding multifractal spectrum is non-trivial for every non-exceptional totally
non-recurrent rational semigroup satisfying the Nice Open Set Condition. Finally, we settle a
long standing problem in the theory of rational semigroups by proving that for our class of semigroups
the Hausdorff dimension of each fiber Julia set is strictly smaller than the Hausdorff dimension
of the global Julia set of the semigroup.
