A binary string transmitted via a memoryless i.i.d. deletion channel is received as a subsequence
of the original input. From this, one obtains a posterior distribution on the channel input, corresponding
to a set of candidate supersequences weighted by the number of times the received subsequence can
be embedded in them. In a previous work it is conjectured on the basis of experimental data that the
entropy of the posterior is minimized and maximized by the constant and the alternating strings,
respectively. In this work, in addition to revisiting the entropy minimization conjecture, we
also address several related combinatorial problems. We present an algorithm for counting the
number of subsequence embeddings using a run-length encoding of strings. We then describe methods
for clustering the space of supersequences such that the cardinality of the resulting sets depends
only on the length of the received subsequence and its Hamming weight, but not its exact form. Then,
we consider supersequences that contain a single embedding of a fixed subsequence, referred to
as singletons, and provide a closed form expression for enumerating them using the same run-length
encoding. We prove an analogous result for the minimization and maximization of the number of singletons,
by the alternating and the uniform strings, respectively. Next, we prove the original minimal entropy
conjecture for the special cases of single and double deletions using similar clustering techniques
and the same run-length encoding, which allow us to characterize the distribution of the number
of subsequence embeddings in the space of compatible supersequences to demonstrate the effect
of an entropy decreasing operation.
