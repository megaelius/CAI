We study estimation of the covariance matrix under relative condition number loss $\kappa(\Sigma^{-1/2}
\hat{\Sigma} \Sigma^{-1/2})$, where $\kappa(\Delta)$ is the condition number of matrix $\Delta$,
and $\hat{\Sigma}$ and $\Sigma$ are the estimated and theoretical covariance matrices. Optimality
in $\kappa$-loss provides optimal guarantees in two stylized applications: Multi-User Covariance
Estimation and Multi-Task Linear Discriminant Analysis. We assume the so-called spiked covariance
model for $\Sigma$, and exploit recent advances in understanding that model, to derive a nonlinear
shrinker which is asymptotically optimal among orthogonally-equivariant procedures. In our
asymptotic study, the number of variables $p$ is comparable to the number of observations $n$. The
form of the optimal nonlinearity depends on the aspect ratio $\gamma=p/n$ of the data matrix and
on the top eigenvalue of $\Sigma$. For $\gamma > 0.618...$, even dependence on the top eigenvalue
can be avoided. The optimal shrinker has two notable properties. First, when $p/n \rightarrow \gamma
\gg 1$ is large, it shrinks even very large eigenvalues substantially, by a factor $1/(1+\gamma)$.
Second, even for moderate $\gamma$, certain highly statistically significant eigencomponents
will be completely suppressed. We show that when $\gamma \gg 1$ is large, purely diagonal covariance
matrices can be optimal, despite the top eigenvalues being large and the empirical eigenvalues
being highly statistically significant. This aligns with practitioner experience. We identify
intuitively reasonable procedures with small worst-case relative regret - the simplest being
generalized soft thresholding having threshold at the bulk edge and slope $(1+\gamma)^{-1}$ above
the bulk. For $\gamma < 2$ it has at most a few percent relative regret.
