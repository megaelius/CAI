For non-negative integers $(d_n(k))_{k \ge 1}$ such that $\sum_{k \ge 1} d_n(k) = n$, we sample a
planar tree with $n$ inner vertices uniformly at random amongst those which have $d_n(k)$ vertices
with out-degree $k$ for every $k \ge 1$ and we study its asymptotic behaviour as $n \to \infty$. We
first prove that such trees always grow like $\epsilon_n / \sigma_n$, where $\epsilon_n = \sum_{k
\ge 1} k d_n(k)$ is the number of edges and $\sigma_n^2 = \sum_{k \ge 1} k (k-1) d_n(k)$ is a variance
term. More precisely, we prove that the probability that the maximal height does not reach $\epsilon_n
/ (x \sigma_n)$ or exceeds $x \epsilon_n / \sigma_n$ is smaller than some universal function which
decays exponentially fast as $x \to \infty$. This improves on a first result due to Louigi Addario-Berry
who considered a larger scaling factor for the tail at infinity; furthermore this confirms in this
context, in a much stronger sense, a conjecture of Svante Janson on Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees.
Relying on this result, we then prove that the sequence of rescaled contour processes of such trees
(and more generally forests) is always tight, and therefore these trees always admit subsequential
limits in the so-called Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology. Using known bijection with labelled
trees, we finally consider uniformly random bipartite planar maps where now $d_n(k)$ is the number
of faces of degree $2k$ for each $k \ge 1$. We prove similarly that these maps, now rescaled by $\sigma_n^{-1/2}$,
always admit subsequential limits in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology (surprisingly,
this does not use tightness of the trees). Our main result relies on a new spinal decomposition which
is of independent interest. This paper also serves as a toolbox for a companion paper in which we discuss
more precisely Brownian limits of such trees and maps.
