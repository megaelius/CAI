The optimal scheduling of interfering links in a dense wireless network with full frequency reuse
is a challenging task. The traditional method involves first estimating all the interfering channel
strengths then optimizing the scheduling based on the model. This model-based method is however
resource intensive and computationally hard, because channel estimation is expensive in dense
networks; further, finding even a locally optimal solution of the resulting optimization problem
may be computationally complex. This paper shows that by using a deep learning approach, it is possible
to bypass channel estimation and to schedule links efficiently based solely on the geographic locations
of transmitters and receivers for networks in which the channels are largely functions of distance
dependent path-losses. This is accomplished by unsupervised training over randomly deployed
networks, and by using a novel neural network architecture that takes the geographic spatial convolutions
of the interfering or interfered neighboring nodes as input over multiple feedback stages to learn
the optimum solution. The resulting neural network gives near-optimal performance for sum-rate
maximization and is capable of generalizing to larger deployment areas and to deployments of different
link densities. Moreover, to provide fairness, this paper proposes a novel scheduling approach
that utilizes the sum-rate optimal scheduling algorithm over judiciously chosen subsets of links
for maximizing a proportional fairness objective over the network. The proposed approach shows
highly competitive and generalizable network utility maximization results.
