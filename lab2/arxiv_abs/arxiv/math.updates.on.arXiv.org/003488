LTE in unlicensed spectrum using licensed assisted access LTE (LTE-LAA) is a promising approach
to overcome the wireless spectrum scarcity. However, to reap the benefits of LTE-LAA, a fair coexistence
mechanism with other incumbent WiFi deployments is required. In this paper, a novel deep learning
approach is proposed for modeling the resource allocation problem of LTE-LAA small base stations
(SBSs). The proposed approach enables multiple SBSs to proactively perform dynamic channel selection,
carrier aggregation, and fractional spectrum access while guaranteeing fairness with existing
WiFi networks and other LTE-LAA operators. Adopting a proactive coexistence mechanism enables
future delay-tolerant LTE-LAA data demands to be served within a given prediction window ahead
of their actual arrival time thus avoiding the underutilization of the unlicensed spectrum during
off-peak hours while maximizing the total served LTE-LAA traffic load. To this end, a noncooperative
game model is formulated in which SBSs are modeled as Homo Egualis agents that aim at predicting a
sequence of future actions and thus achieving long-term equal weighted fairness with WLAN and other
LTE-LAA operators over a given time horizon. The proposed deep learning algorithm is then shown
to reach a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), when it converges. Simulation results using real
data traces show that the proposed scheme can yield up to 28% and 11% gains over a conventional reactive
approach and a proportional fair coexistence mechanism, respectively. The results also show that
the proposed framework prevents WiFi performance degradation for a densely deployed LTE-LAA network.
