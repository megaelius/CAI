In the 1970s, Feigenbaum, and independently, Coullet and Tresser, discovered an interesting phenomenon
in physics called period doubling that showed how a sequence of dynamical systems with stable dynamics
can converge to one with chaotic dynamics. In this paper we study analogous phenomena for the tangent
family $\{T_t(z)=i t\tan z\}_{\pi/2\leq t\leq \pi}$ restricted to the real and imaginary axes.
Because tangent maps have no critical points but have an essential singularity at infinity and two
asymptotic values, the phenomena are related but different. We find single instances of "period
doubling", "period quadrupling" and "period splitting". Then we prove there is a general pattern
of "period merging" where two attracting cycles of period $2^n$ "merge" into one attracting cycle
of period $2^{n+1}$ and "cycle doubling" where an attracting cycle of period $2^{n+1}$ "becomes"
two attracting cycles of the same period. We adapt the renormalization techniques used to study
period doubling in quadratic maps to our family. We prove that there is an "infinitely renormalizable"
tangent map $T_{\infty}$ that has no attracting or parabolic cycles. Instead, it has a strange attractor
contained in the real and imaginary axes which is forward invariant and minimal under under $T^2_{\infty}$.
The intersection of this strange attractor with the real line consists of two binary Cantor sets
and the intersection with the imaginary line is totally disconnected, perfect, uncountable and
unbounded. We note renormalization exists in the complex $t$ plane of the tangent family where there
is cycle doubling and merging. In fact, renormalization also exists in dynamical natural slices
(see \cite{FK}) of more general families of meromorphic functions.
