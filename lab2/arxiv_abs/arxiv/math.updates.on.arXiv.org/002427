Sliding mode control (SMC) is a robust and computationally efficient model-based controller design
technique for highly nonlinear systems, in the presence of model and external uncertainties. However,
the implementation of the conventional continuous-time SMC on digital computers is limited, due
to the imprecisions caused by data sampling and quantization, and the chattering phenomena, which
results in high frequency oscillations. One effective solution to minimize the effects of data
sampling and quantization imprecisions is the use of higher order sliding modes. To this end, in
this paper, a new formulation of an adaptive second order discrete sliding mode control (DSMC) is
presented for a general class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uncertain nonlinear systems.
Based on a Lyapunov stability argument and by invoking the new Invariance Principle, not only the
asymptotic stability of the controller is guaranteed, but also the adaptation law is derived to
remove the uncertainties within the nonlinear plant dynamics. The proposed adaptive tracking
controller is designed and tested in real-time for a highly nonlinear control problem in spark ignition
combustion engine during transient operating conditions. The simulation and real-time processor-in-the-loop
(PIL) test results show that the second order single-input single-output (SISO) DSMC can improve
the tracking performances up to 90%, compared to a first order SISO DSMC under sampling and quantization
imprecisions, in the presence of modeling uncertainties. Moreover, it is observed that by converting
the engine SISO controllers to a MIMO structure, the overall controller performance can be enhanced
by 25%, compared to the SISO second order DSMC, because of the dynamics coupling consideration within
the MIMO DSMC formulation.
