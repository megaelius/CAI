Multi-frequency subspace migration imaging technique are usually adopted for the non-iterative
imaging of unknown electromagnetic targets such as cracks in the concrete walls or bridges, anti-personnel
mines in the ground, etc. in the inverse scattering problems. It is confirmed that this technique
is very fast, effective, robust, and can be applied not only full- but also limited-view inverse
problems if suitable number of incident and corresponding scattered field are applied and collected.
But in many works, the application of such technique is somehow heuristic. Under the motivation
of such heuristic application, this contribution analyzes the structure of imaging functional
employed in the subspace migration imaging technique in two-dimensional inverse scattering when
the unknown target is arbitrary shaped, arc-like perfectly conducting cracks located in the homogeneous
two-dimensional space. Opposite to the Statistical approach based on the Statistical Hypothesis
Testing, our approach is based on the fact that subspace migration imaging functional can be expressed
by a linear combination of Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind. This is based on the
structure of the Multi-Static Response (MSR) matrix collected in the far-field at nonzero frequency
in either Transverse Magnetic (TM) mode or Transverse Electric (TE) mode. Explored expression
of imaging functionals gives us certain properties of subspace migration and an answer of why multi-frequency
enhances imaging resolution. Particularly, we carefully analyze the subspace migration and confirm
some properties of imaging when a small number of incident field is applied. Consequently, we simply
introduce a weighted multi-frequency imaging functional and confirm that which is an improved
version of subspace migration in TM mode.
