This chapter investigates numerical solution of nonlinear two-point boundary value problems.
It establishes a connection between three important, seemingly unrelated, classes of iterative
methods, namely: the linearization methods, the relaxation methods (finite difference methods),
and the shooting methods. It has recently been demonstrated that using finite differences to discretize
the sequence of linear problems obtained by quasi-linearization, Picard linearization, or constant-slope
linearization, leads to the usual iteration formula of the respective relaxation method. Thus,
the linearization methods can be used as a basis to derive the relaxation methods. In this work we
demonstrate that the shooting methods can be derived from the linearization methods, too. We show
that relaxing a shooting trajectory, i.e. an initial value problem solution, is in fact a projection
transformation. The obtained function, called projection trajectory, can be used to correct the
initial condition. Using the new initial condition, we can find a new shooting trajectory, and so
on. The described procedure is called shooting-projection iteration (SPI). We show that using
the quasi-linearization equation to relax (project) the shooting trajectory leads to the usual
shooting by Newton method, the constant-slope linearization leads to the usual shooting by constant-slope
method, while the Picard linearization leads to the recently proposed shooting-projection method.
Therefore, the latter method can rightfully be called shooting by Picard method. A possible application
of the new theoretical results is suggested and numerical computer experiments are presented.
MATLAB codes are provided.
