The overall goal of this dissertation is to investigate certain classical results from harmonic
analysis, replacing the Euclidean setting, the abelian structure and the elliptic Laplace operator
with a non-commutative environment and hypoelliptic operators. More specifically, we consider
wave equations for hypoelliptic homogeneous left-invariant operators on graded Lie groups with
time-dependent non-negative propagation speeds that are H\"older-regular or even more so. The
corresponding Euclidean problem has been extensively studied in the `80s and some additional results
have been recently obtained by Garetto and Ruzhansky in the case of a compact Lie group. We establish
sharp well-posedness results in the spirit of the classical result by Colombini, De Giorgi and Spagnolo.
In this investigation, a structure reminiscent of Gevrey regularity appears, inspiring deeper
investigation of certain classes of functions and a comparison with Gevrey classes. In the latter
part of this thesis we discuss such Gevrey spaces associated to the sums of squares of vector fields
satisfying the H\"ormander condition on manifolds. This provides a deeper understanding of the
Gevrey hypoellipticity of sub-Laplacians. It is known that if $\mathcal L$ is a Laplacian on a closed
manifold $M$ then the standard Gevrey space $\gamma^s$ on $M$ defined in local coordinates can be
characterised by the condition that $\|e^{D\mathcal L^{\frac{1}{2s}}}\phi\|_{L^2(M)}<\infty$
for some $D>0$. The aim in this part is to discuss the conjecture that a similar characterisation
holds true if $\mathcal L$ is H\"ormander's sum of squares of vector fields, with a sub-Laplacian
version of the Gevrey spaces involving these vector fields only. We prove this conjecture in one
direction, while in the other we show it holds for sub-Laplacians on $SU(2)$ and on the Heisenberg
group $\mathbb{H}_n$.
