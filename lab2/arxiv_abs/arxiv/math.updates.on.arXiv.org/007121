While reduced-order models (ROMs) have demonstrated success in many applications across computational
science, challenges remain when applied both to extreme-scale models due to the prohibitive cost
of generating requisite training data, and to decomposable systems due to many-query problems
often requiring repeated reconfigurations of system components. Therefore, we propose the domain-decomposition
least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (DD-LSPG) model-reduction method applicable to parameterized
systems of nonlinear algebraic equations. In contrast with previous works, we adopt an algebraically
non-overlapping decomposition strategy rather than a spatial-decomposition strategy, which
facilitates application to different spatial-discretization schemes. Rather than constructing
a low-dimensional subspace for the entire state space in a monolithic fashion---which would be
infeasible for extreme-scale systems and decomposable models---the methodology constructs
separate subspaces for the different subdomains/components characterizing the original model.
In the offline stage, the method constructs low-dimensional bases for the interior and interface
of components. In the online stage, the approach constructs an LSPG ROM for each component and enforces
strong or weak compatibility on the 'ports' connecting them. We propose four different ways to construct
reduced bases on the interface/ports of subdomains and several ways to enforce compatibility across
connecting ports. We derive a posteriori and a priori error bounds for the DD-LSPG solutions. Numerical
results performed on nonlinear benchmark problems in heat transfer and fluid dynamics demonstrate
that the proposed method performs well in terms of both accuracy and computational cost, with different
choices of basis and compatibility constraints yielding different performance profiles.
