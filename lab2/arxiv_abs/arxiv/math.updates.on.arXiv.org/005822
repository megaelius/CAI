The dynamics of a beam held on a horizontal frame by springs and bouncing off a step is described by
a separable two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system with impacts that respect, point wise, the
separability symmetry. The energy in each degree of freedom is preserved, and the motion along each
level set is conjugated, via action angle coordinates, to a geodesic flow on a flat two-dimensional
surface in the four dimensional phase space. Yet, for a range of energies, these surfaces are not
the simple Liouville-Arnold tori - these are tori of genus two, thus the motion on them is not conjugated
to simple rotations. Namely, even though energy is not transferred between the two degrees of freedom,
the impact system is quasi-integrable and is not of the Liouville-Arnold type. In fact, for each
level set in this range, the motion is conjugated to the well studied and highly non-trivial dynamics
of directional motion in L-shaped billiards, where the billiard area and shape as well as the direction
of motion vary continuously on iso-energetic level sets. Return maps to Poincar\'e section of the
flow are shown to be conjugated, on each level set, to interval exchange maps which are computed,
up to quadratures, in the general nonlinear case and explicitly for the case of two linear oscillators
bouncing off a step. It is established that for any such oscillator-step system there exist step
locations for which some of the level sets exhibit motion which is neither periodic nor ergodic.
Changing the impact surface by introducing additional steps, staircases, strips and blocks from
which the particle is reflected, leads to iso-energy surfaces that are foliated by families of genus-k
level set surfaces, where the number and order of families of genus k depend on the energy.
