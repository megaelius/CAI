The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging
requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of
the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly
behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received
signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding
objects. The recent advent of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications
enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction
characteristics of the radio waves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation.
Recent results have revealed that reconfigurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control
the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging
signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations.
Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide
the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions,
and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open
research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces necessitates
to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This
article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted
communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases
of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.
