In \cite{ono}, K. Ono, S. Robins and P.T. Wahl considered the problem of determining formulas for
the number of representations of a natural number $n$ by a sum of $k$ triangular numbers and derived
many applications, including the one connecting these numbers with the number of representations
of $n$ as a sum of $k$ odd square integers. They also obtained an application to the number of lattice
points in the $k$-dimensional sphere. In this paper, we consider triangular numbers with positive
integer coefficients. First we show that if the sum of these coefficients is a multiple of $8$, then
the associated generating function gives rise to a modular form of integral weight (when even number
of triangular numbers are taken). We then use the theory of modular forms to get the representation
number formulas corresponding to the triangular numbers with coefficients. We also obtain several
applications concerning the triangular numbers with coefficients similar to the ones obtained
in \cite{ono}. In the second part of the paper, we consider more general mixed forms (as done in Xia-Ma-Tian
\cite{xia}) and derive modular properties for the corresponding generating functions associated
to these mixed forms. Using our method we deduce all the 21 formulas proved in \cite[Theorem 1.1]{xia}
and show that our method of deriving the 21 formulas together with the $(p,k)$ parametrization of
the generating functions of the three mixed forms imply the $(p,k)$ parametrization of the Eisenstein
series $E_4(\tau)$ and its duplications. It is to be noted that the $(p,k)$ parametrization of $E_4$
and its duplications were derived by a different method by K. S. Williams and his co-authors. In the
final section, we provide sample formulas for these representation numbers in the case of 4 and 6
variable forms.
