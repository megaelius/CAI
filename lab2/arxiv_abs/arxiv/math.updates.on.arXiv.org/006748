We prove Feigin-Frenkel type dualities between subregular W-algebras of type A, B and principal
W-superalgebras of type $\mathfrak{sl}(1|n), \mathfrak{osp}(2|2n)$. The type A case proves
a conjecture of Feigin and Semikhatov. Let $(\mathfrak{g}_1,\mathfrak{g}_2) = (\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1},\mathfrak{sl}(1|n+1))$
or $(\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}, \mathfrak{osp}(2|2n))$ and let $r$ be the lacity of $\mathfrak{g}_1$.
Let k be a complex number and $\ell$ defined by $r(k+h^\vee_1)(\ell+h^\vee_2)=1$ with $h^\vee_i$
the dual Coxeter numbers of the $\mathfrak g_i$. Our first main result is that the Heisenberg cosets
$\mathcal C^k(\mathfrak g_1)$ and $\mathcal C^\ell(\mathfrak g_2)$ of these W-algebras at these
dual levels are isomorphic, i.e. $\mathcal C^k(\mathfrak g_1) \simeq \mathcal C^\ell(\mathfrak
g_2)$ for generic k. We determine the generic levels and furthermore establish analogous results
for the cosets of the simple quotients of the W-algebras. Our second result is a novel Kazama-Suzuki
type coset construction: We show that a diagonal Heisenberg coset of the subregular W-algebra at
level $k$ times the lattice vertex superalgebra $V_{\mathbb Z}$ is the principal W-superalgebra
at the dual level $\ell$. Conversely a diagonal Heisenberg coset of the principal W-superalgebra
at level $\ell$ times the lattice vertex superalgebra $V_{\sqrt{-1}\mathbb Z}$ is the subregular
W-algebra at the dual level k. Again this is proven for the universal W-algebras as well as for the
simple quotients. We show that a consequence of the Kazama-Suzuki type construction is that the
simple principal W-superalgebra and its Heisenberg coset at level $\ell$ are rational and/or C_2-cofinite
if the same is true for the simple subregular W-algebra at dual level $\ell$. This gives many new C_2-cofiniteness
and rationality results.
