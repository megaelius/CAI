We consider the self-dual Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation (CSS). CSS is $L^{2}$-critical,
admits solitons, and has the pseudoconformal symmetry. In this work, we consider pseudoconformal
blow-up solutions under $m$-equivariance, $m\geq1$. Our result is threefold. Firstly, we construct
a pseudoconformal blow-up solution $u$ with given asymptotic profile $z^{\ast}$: \[ \Big[u(t,r)-\frac{1}{|t|}Q\Big(\frac{r}{|t|}\Big)e^{-i\frac{r^{2}}{4|t|}}\Big]e^{im\theta}\to
z^{\ast}\qquad\text{in }H^{1} \] as $t\to0^{-}$, where $Q(r)e^{im\theta}$ is a static solution.
Secondly, we show that such blow-up solutions are unique in a suitable class. Lastly, we exhibit
an instability mechanism of $u$. We construct a continuous family of solutions $u^{(\eta)}$, $0\leq\eta\ll1$,
such that $u^{(0)}=u$ and for $\eta>0$, $u^{(\eta)}$ is a global scattering solution exhibiting
a rotational instability as $\eta\to0^{+}$: $u^{(\eta)}$ takes an abrupt spatial rotation by
the angle \[ \Big(\frac{m+1}{m}\Big)\pi \] on the time interval $|t|\lesssim\eta$. We are inspired
by works in the $L^{2}$-critical NLS. In the seminal work of Bourgain and Wang (1997), they constructed
such pseudoconformal blow-up solutions. Merle, Rapha\"el, and Szeftel (2013) showed an instability
of Bourgain-Wang solutions. Although CSS shares many features with NLS, there are essential differences
and obstacles over NLS. To name a few, the soliton profile to CSS shows a slow decay $r^{-(m+2)}$,
CSS has nonlocal nonlinearities responsible for strong long-range interactions, and the instability
mechanism of CSS is completely different from that of NLS. Here, the phase rotation is the main source
of the instability. On the other hand, the self-dual structure of CSS is our sponsor to overcome these
obstacles. We exploited the self-duality in many places such as the linearization, spectral properties,
and construction of modified profiles.
