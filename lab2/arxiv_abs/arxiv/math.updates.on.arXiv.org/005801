The main thrust of this work is to extend some basic results in Hodge Theory to the higher pages of the
Fr\"olicher spectral sequence. For an arbitrary nonnegative integer $r$, we introduce the class
of page-$r$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds by requiring the analogue of the Hodge decomposition
to hold on a compact complex manifold $X$ when the usual Dolbeault cohomology groups $H^{p,\,q}_{\bar\partial}(X)$
are replaced by the spaces $E_{r+1}^{p,\,q}(X)$ featuring on the $(r+1)$-st page of the Fr\"olicher
spectral sequence of $X$. The class of page-$r$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds increases
as $r$ increases and coincides with the usual class of $\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds when
$r=0$. We investigate various properties of these manifolds and show that they are analogous to
those of $\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds with some noteworthy exceptions. We also point out
a number of examples. For instance, all complex parallelisable nilmanifolds, including the Iwasawa
manifold and a $5$-dimensional analogue thereof, are page-$1$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds,
although they are seldom $\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds. The deformation properties of page-$1$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds
are also investigated and a general notion of essential small deformations is introduced for Calabi-Yau
manifolds. We also introduce higher-page analogues of the Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies
and highlight their relations to the new class of manifolds. On the other hand, we prove analogues
of the Serre duality for the spaces featuring in the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence and for the higher-page
Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies.
