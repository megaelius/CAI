A theory of modules over posets is developed to define computationally feasible, topologically
interpretable data structures, in terms of birth and death of homology classes, for persistent
homology with multiple real parameters. To replace the noetherian hypothesis in the general setting
of modules over posets, a "finitely encoded" condition is defined combinatorially and developed
algebraically. It captures topological tameness of persistent homology. Poset-modules satisfying
it can be specified by "fringe presentations" that reflect birth-and-death descriptions of persistence.
A syzygy theorem characterizes finitely encoded modules as admitting appropriately finite presentations
and resolutions. The geometric and algebraic theory focuses on modules over real polyhedral groups
(real vector spaces with polyhedral positive cones) and a parallel theory over discrete polyhedral
groups (abelian groups with finitely generated positive cones). Existence of primary decomposition
is proved over arbitrary polyhedral partially ordered abelian groups, but the real and discrete
cases carry enough geometry and, crucially in the real case, topology to induce complete theories
of minimal primary and secondary decomposition, associated and attached faces, minimal generators
and cogenerators, socles and tops, minimal upset covers and downset hulls, Matlis duality, and
minimal fringe presentation. Real semialgebraic properties of data are preserved by functorial
constructions. Tops and socles become functorial birth and death spaces for multiparameter persistence
modules. They yield functorial "QR codes" and "elder morphisms" for modules over real and discrete
polyhedral groups that generalize and categorify the bar code and elder rule for persistent homology
in one parameter. The disparate ways that QR codes and elder morphisms model bar codes coalesce,
in one parameter, to functorial bar codes.
