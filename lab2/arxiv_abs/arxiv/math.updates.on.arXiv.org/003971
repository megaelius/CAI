We consider iterative methods for solving the linearised Navier-Stokes equations arising from
two-phase flow problems and the efficient preconditioning of such systems when using mixed finite
element methods. Our target application is simulation within the Proteus toolkit; in particular,
we will give results for a dynamic dam-break problem in 2D. We focus on a preconditioner motivated
by approximate commutators which has proved effective, displaying mesh-independent convergence
for the constant coefficient single-phase Navier-Stokes equations. This approach is known as
the "pressure convection-diffusion" (PCD) preconditioner [H. C. Elman, D. J. Silvester and A.
J. Wathen, Finite Elements and Fast Iterative Solvers: with Applications in Incompressible Fluid
Dynamics, second ed., Oxford University Press, 2014]. However, the original technique fails to
give comparable performance in its given form when applied to variable coefficient Navier-Stokes
systems such as those arising in two-phase flow models. Here we develop a generalisation of this
preconditioner appropriate for two-phase flow, requiring a new form for PCD. We omit considerations
of boundary conditions to focus on the key features of two-phase flow. Before considering our target
application, we present numerical results within the controlled setting of a simplified problem
using a variety of different mixed elements. We compare these results with those for a straightforward
extension to another commutator-based method known as the "least-squares commutator" (LSC) preconditioner,
a technique also discussed in the aforementioned reference. We demonstrate that favourable properties
of the original PCD and LSC preconditioners (without boundary adjustments) are retained with the
new preconditioners in the two-phase situation.
