A Skeleton-stabilized ImmersoGeometric Analysis technique is proposed for incompressible viscous
flow problems with moderate Reynolds number. The proposed formulation fits within the framework
of the finite cell method, where essential boundary conditions are imposed weakly using a Nitsche-type
method. The key idea of the proposed formulation is to stabilize the jumps of high-order derivatives
of variables over the skeleton of the background mesh. The formulation allows the use of identical
finite-dimensional spaces for the approximation of the pressure and velocity fields in immersed
domains. The stability issues observed for inf-sup stable discretizations of immersed incompressible
flow problems are avoided with this formulation. For B-spline basis functions of degree $k$ with
highest regularity, only the derivative of order $k$ has to be controlled, which requires specification
of only a single stabilization parameter for the pressure field. The Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations
are studied numerically in two and three dimensions using various immersed test cases. Oscillation-free
solutions and high-order optimal convergence rates can be obtained. The formulation is shown to
be stable even in limit cases where almost every elements of the physical domain is cut, and hence
it does not require the existence of interior cells. In terms of the sparsity pattern, the algebraic
system has a considerably smaller stencil than counterpart approaches based on Lagrange basis
functions. This important property makes the proposed skeleton-stabilized technique computationally
practical. To demonstrate the stability and robustness of the method, we perform a simulation of
fluid flow through a porous medium, of which the geometry is directly extracted from 3D $\mu{CT}$
scan data.
