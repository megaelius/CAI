Machine learning (ML) has attracted a great research interest for the problems in the physical layer
of wireless communications, such as channel estimation, thanks to its low computational complexity
and robustness against imperfect channel data. Channel estimation via ML requires model training
on a dataset, which usually includes the received pilot signals as input and channel data as output.
In previous works, model training is mostly done in a centralized manner, where the whole training
dataset is collected from the users at the base station (BS). This approach introduces huge transmission
overhead for data collection from the users. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose
a federated learning (FL) framework for channel estimation. We design a convolutional neural network
(CNN) trained on the local datasets of the users without sending them to the BS. We develop FL-based
channel estimation schemes for both conventional and IRS (intelligent reflecting surface) assisted
massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems, where a single CNN is trained for two different
datasets for both scenarios. Even if the IRS-assisted massive MIMO includes two different channels,
namely the direct and cascaded channels, their estimation is performed with a single CNN, without
using multiple CNNs for each task. Via numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance for noisy
and quantized model transmission and show that the proposed approach provides approximately 16
times lower transmission overhead than the centralized learning (CL) schemes, while maintaining
satisfactory channel estimation performance close to CL. Furthermore, the proposed CNN architecture
exhibits lower estimation error than the state-of-the-art ML-based channel estimation schemes.
