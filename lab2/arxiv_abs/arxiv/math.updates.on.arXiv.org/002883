The clustering of a data set is one of the core tasks in data analytics. Many clustering algorithms
exhibit a strong contrast between a favorable performance in practice and bad theoretical worst-cases.
Prime examples are least-squares assignments and the popular $k$-means algorithm. We are interested
in this contrast and study it through polyhedral theory. Several popular clustering algorithms
can be connected to finding a vertex of the so-called bounded-shape partition polytopes. The vertices
correspond to clusterings with extraordinary separation properties, in particular allowing
the construction of a separating power diagram, defined by its so-called sites, such that each cluster
has its own cell. First, we quantitatively measure the space of all sites that allow construction
of a separating power diagram for a clustering by the volume of the normal cone at the corresponding
vertex. This gives rise to a new quality criterion for clusterings, and explains why good clusterings
are also the most likely to be found by some classical algorithms. Second, we characterize the edges
of the bounded-shape partition polytopes. Through this, we obtain an explicit description of the
normal cones. This allows us to compute measures with respect to the new quality criterion, and even
compute "most stable" sites, and thereby "most stable" power diagrams, for the separation of clusters.
The hardness of these computations depends on the number of edges incident to a vertex, which may
be exponential. However, the computational effort is rewarded with a wealth of information that
can be gained from the results, which we highlight through some proof-of-concept computations.
