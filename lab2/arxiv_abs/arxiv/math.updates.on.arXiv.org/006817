It is known that the set of internally stabilizing controller $\mathcal{C}_{\text{stab}}$ is
non-convex, but it admits convex characterizations using certain closed-loop maps: a classical
result is the {Youla parameterization}, and two recent notions are the {system-level parameterization}
(SLP) and the {input-output parameterization} (IOP). In this paper, we address the existence of
new convex parameterizations and discuss potential tradeoffs of each parametrization in different
scenarios. Our main contributions are: 1) We first reveal that only four groups of stable closed-loop
transfer matrices are equivalent to internal stability: one of them is used in the SLP, another one
is used in the IOP, and the other two are new, leading to two new convex parameterizations of $\mathcal{C}_{\text{stab}}$.
2) We then investigate the properties of these parameterizations after imposing the finite impulse
response (FIR) approximation, revealing that the IOP has the best ability of approximating $\mathcal{C}_{\text{stab}}$
given FIR constraints. 3) These four parameterizations require no \emph{a priori} doubly-coprime
factorization of the plant, but impose a set of equality constraints. However, these equality constraints
will never be satisfied exactly in numerical computation. We prove that the IOP is numerically robust
for open-loop stable plants, in the sense that small mismatches in the equality constraints do not
compromise the closed-loop stability. The SLP is known to enjoy numerical robustness in the state
feedback case; here, we show that numerical robustness of the four-block SLP controller requires
case-by-case analysis in the general output feedback case.
