A classical result due to Diers shows that a presheaf $F\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathbf{Set}$ on
a category $\mathcal{A}$ is a coproduct of representables precisely when each connected component
of $F$'s category of elements has an initial object. Most often, this condition is imposed on a presheaf
of the form $\mathcal{B}\left(X,L-\right)$ for a functor $L\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$,
in which case this property says that $L$ admits generic factorisations at $X$, or equivalently
that $L$ has a left multiadjoint at $X$. Here we generalize these results to the two dimensional setting,
replacing $\mathcal{A}$ with an arbitrary bicategory $\mathscr{A}$, and $\mathbf{Set}$ with
$\mathbf{Cat}$. In this two dimensional setting, simply asking that a bi-presheaf $F\colon\mathscr{A}\to\mathbf{Cat}$
be a coproduct of representables is often too strong of a condition. Instead, we will only ask that
$F$ be a lax conical colimit of representables. This is turn allows for the weaker notion of lax generic
factorisations (and lax multiadjoints) for pseudofunctors of bicategories $L\colon\mathscr{A}\to\mathscr{B}$.
We also compare our lax multiadjoints to Weber's familial 2-functors, finding our description
is more general (not requiring a terminal object in $\mathscr{A}$), though essentially equivalent
when a terminal object does exist. Moreover, our description of lax generics allows for an equivalence
between lax generic factorisations and famility. Finally, we characterize our lax multiadjoints
as right lax $\mathsf{F}$-adjoints followed by locally discrete fibrations of bicategories,
which in turn yields a more natural definition of parametric right adjoint pseudofunctors.
