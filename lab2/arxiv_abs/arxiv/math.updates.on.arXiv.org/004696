This paper considers a wireless networked control system (WNCS) consisting of a dynamic system
to be controlled (i.e., a plant), a sensor, an actuator and a remote controller for mission-critical
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. A WNCS has two types of wireless transmissions,
i.e., the sensor's measurement transmission to the controller and the controller's command transmission
to the actuator. In the literature of WNCSs, the controllers are commonly assumed to work in a full-duplex
mode, i.e., can simultaneously receive the sensor's information and transmit its own command to
the actuator. In this work, we consider a practical half-duplex controller, which introduces a
novel transmission-scheduling problem for WNCSs. A frequent schedule of the sensor's transmission
results in a better estimation of the plant states at the controller and thus a higher quality of the
control command, but it leads to a less frequent/timely control of the plant. Therefore, considering
the overall control performance of the plant, i.e., the average-cost function of the plant, there
exists a fundamental tradeoff between the sensor's and controller's transmission. We formulate
a new problem to optimize the transmission-scheduling policy that minimizes the long-term average
cost function. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of a stationary
and deterministic optimal policy that results in a bounded average cost in terms of the transmission
reliability of the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels. Also, we derive
an easy-to-compute suboptimal policy, which notably reduces the average cost of the plant compared
to a naive alternative-scheduling policy.
