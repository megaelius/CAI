Motivated by some recent potential theoretic results on subordinate killed L\'evy processes in
open subsets of the Euclidean space, we study processes in an open set $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ defined
via Dirichlet forms with jump kernels of the form $J^D(x,y)=j(|x-y|)\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ and critical
killing functions. Here $j(|x-y|)$ is the L\'evy density of an isotropic stable process (or more
generally, a pure jump isotropic unimodal L\'evy process) in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The main novelty
is that the term $\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ tends to 0 when $x$ or $y$ approach the boundary of $D$. Under
some general assumptions on $\mathcal{B}(x, y)$, we construct the corresponding process and prove
that non-negative harmonic functions of the process satisfy the Harnack inequality and Carleson's
estimate. We give several examples of boundary terms satisfying those assumptions. The examples
depend on three parameters, $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$, roughly governing the decay of the boundary
term near the boundary of $D$. In the second part of this paper, we specialize to the case of the half-space
$D=\mathbb{R}_+^d=\{x=(\widetilde{x},x_d):\, x_d>0\}$, the $\alpha$-stable kernel $j(|x-y|)=|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}$
and the killing function $\kappa(x)=c x_d^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$, where $c$ is a positive
constant. Our main result in this part is a boundary Harnack principle which says that, for any $p>(\alpha-1)_+$,
there are values of the parameters $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ and the constant $c$ such that non-negative
harmonic functions of the process must decay at the rate $x_d^p$ if they vanish near a portion of the
boundary. We further show that there are values of the parameters $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ for
which the boundary Harnack principle fails despite the fact that Carleson's estimate is valid.
