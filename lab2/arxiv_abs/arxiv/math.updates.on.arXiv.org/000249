In this paper we consider the cohomology of four groups related to the virtual braids of [Kauffman]
and [Goussarov-Polyak-Viro], namely the pure and non-pure virtual braid groups (PvB_n and vB_n,
respectively), and the pure and non-pure flat braid groups (PfB_n and fB_n, respectively). The
cohomologies of PvB_n and PfB_n admit an action of the symmetric group S_n. We give a description
of the cohomology modules H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q) as sums of S_n-modules induced from certain
one-dimensional representations of specific subgroups of S_n. This in particular allows us to
conclude that H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q) are uniformly representation stable, in the sense
of [Church-Farb]. We also give plethystic formulas for the Frobenius characteristics of these
S_n-modules. We then derive a number of constraints on which S_n irreducibles may appear in H^i(PvB_n,Q)
and H^i(PfB_n,Q). In particular, we show that the multiplicity of the alternating representation
in H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q) is identical, and moreover is nil for sufficiently large $n$.
We use this to recover the (previously known) fact that the multiplicity of the alternating representation
in H^i(PB_n,Q) is nil (here PB_n is the ordinary pure braid group). We also give an explicit formula
for H^i(vB_n,Q) and show that H^i(fB_n,Q)=0. Finally, we give Hilbert series for the character
of the action of S_n on H^i(PvB_n,Q) and H^i(PfB_n,Q). An extension of the standard `Koszul formula'
for the graded dimension of Koszul algebras to graded characters of Koszul algebras then gives Hilbert
series for the graded characters of the respective quadratic dual algebras.
