The simplices and the complexes arsing form the grading of the fundamental (desymmetrized) domain
of arithmetical groups and non-arithmetical groups, as well as their extended (symmetrized) ones
are described also for oriented manifolds in dim greater than 2. The conditions for the definition
of fibers are summarized after Hamiltonian analysis, the latters can in some cases be reduced to
those for sections for graded groups, such as the Picard groups and the Vinberg group.The cases for
which modular structures rather than modular-groupstructure measures can be analyzed for non-arithmetic
groups, i.e. also in the cases for which Gelfand triples (rigged spaces) have to be substituted by
Hecke couples, as, for Hecke groups, the existence of intertwining operators after the calculation
of the second commutator within the Haar measures for the operators of the correspondingly-generated
C-[star] algebras is straightforward. The results hold also for (also non-abstract) groups with
measures on (manifold) boundaries. The Poincar\'e invariance of the representation of Wigner-Bargmann
(spin 1/2) particles is analyzed within the Fock-space interaction representation. The well-posed-ness
of initial conditions and boundary ones for the connected (families of) equations is discussed.
As an example, Picard-related equations can be classified according to the genus of the modular
curve(s) attached to the solutions(s). From the Hamiltonian analysis, further results in the contraction
of the congruence (extended sub-)groups for non-arithmetical groups for the construction of tori
is provided as an alternative to the free diffeomorphism group. In addition, the presence of Poincar\'e
complexes is found compatible with non-local interactions, i.e. both lattices interactions or
spin-like ones.
