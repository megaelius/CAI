As a straightforward generalization and extension of our previous paper, J. Phys. A50 (2017) 215201
[TMA:2016] we study aspects of the quantum and classical dynamics of a $3$-body system with equal
masses, each body with $d$ degrees of freedom, with interaction depending only on mutual (relative)
distances. The study is restricted to solutions in the space of relative motion which are functions
of mutual (relative) distances only. It is shown that the ground state (and some other states) in
the quantum case and the planar trajectories (in interaction plane) in the classical case are of
this type. The quantum (and classical) system for which these states are eigenstates is obtained
and its Hamiltonian is derived. It corresponds to a three-dimensional quantum particle moving
in a curved space with special $d$-dimension-independent metric in a certain $d$-dependent singular
potential, while at $d=1$ it elegantly degenerates to two-dimensional particle moving in flat
space. The kinetic energy of the system is $d$-independent, it has a hidden $sl(4,R)$ Lie (Poisson)
algebra structure, alternatively, the hidden algebra $h^{(3)}$ typical for the $H_3$ Calogero
model like in $d=3$ case. We find an exactly-solvable three-body $S^3$-permutationally invariant,
generalized harmonic oscillator-type potential as well as a quasi-exactly-solvable three-body
sextic polynomial type potential with singular terms. For both models an extra first order integral
exists. For $d=1$ the whole family of 3-body (two-dimensional) Calogero-Moser-Sutherland systems
as well as TTW model are reproduced. It is shown that a straightforward generalization of 3-body
(rational) Calogero model to $d>1$ leads to two primitive quasi-exactly-solvable problems. The
extension to the case of non-equal masses is straightforward and is briefly discussed.
