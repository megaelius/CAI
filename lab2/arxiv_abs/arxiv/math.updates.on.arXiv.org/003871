This is the second part to our companion paper [18]. Herein, we generalize to two space dimensions
the C-method developed in [20,18] for adding localized, space-time smooth artificial viscosity
to nonlinear systems of conservation laws that propagate shock waves, rarefaction waves, and contact
discontinuities. For gas dynamics, the C-method couples the Euler equations to scalar reaction-diffusion
equations, which we call C-equations, whose solutions serve as space-time smooth artificial viscosity
indicators for shocks and contacts. We develop a high-order numerical algorithm for gas dynamics
in 2-D which can accurately simulate the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability with Kelvin-Helmholtz
(KH) roll-up of the contact discontinuity, as well as shock collision and bounce-back. We implement
both directionally isotropic and anisotropic artificial viscosity schemes, the latter adding
diffusion only in directions tangential to the evolving front. We additionally produce a novel
shock collision indicator function, which naturally activates during shock collision, and then
smoothly deactivates. Moreover, we implement a high-frequency 2-D wavelet-based noise detector
together with an efficient and localized noise removal algorithm. We provide numerical results
for some classical 2-D test problems, including the RT problem, the Noh problem, a circular explosion
problem from the Liska and Wendroff [13] review paper, the Sedov blast wave problem, the double Mach
10 reflection test, and a shock-wall collision problem. In particular, we show that our artificial
viscosity method can eliminate the wall-heating phenomenon for the Noh problem, and thereby produce
an accurate, non-oscillatory solution, even though our simplified WENO-type scheme fails to run
for this problem.
