In this paper, we study the problem of secure transmission with covert requirement in untrusted
relaying networks. Our considered system model consists of one source, one destination, one untrusted
relay, and one Willie. The untrusted relay tries to extract the information signal, while the goal
of Willie is to detect the presence of the information signal transmitted by the source, in the current
time slot. To overcome these two attacks, we illustrate that the destination and the source should
inject jamming signal to the network in phase I and phase II, respectively. Accordingly, the communication
in our proposed system model is accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, when the source transmits
its data to the untrusted relay the destination broadcasts its jamming signal. In the second phase,
when the relay retransmits the received signal, the source transmits a jamming signal with one of
its antennas. For this system model, we propose a power allocation strategy to maximize the instantaneous
secrecy rate subject to satisfying the covert requirements in both of the phases. Since the proposed
optimization problem is non-convex, we adopt the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach
to convert it to a convex optimization problem. Next, we extend our system model to a practical system
model where there are multiple untrusted relays and multiple Willies under two scenarios of noncolluding
Willies and colluding Willies. Our findings highlight that unlike the direct transmission scheme,
the achievable secrecy rate of the proposed secure transmission scheme improve as the number of
untrusted relays increases.
