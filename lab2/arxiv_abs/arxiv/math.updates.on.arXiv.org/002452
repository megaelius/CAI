An absolute parallelism for $2$-nondegenerate CR manifolds $M$ of hypersurface type was recently
constructed independently by Isaev-Zaitsev, Medori-Spiro, and Pocchiola in the minimal possible
dimension ($\dim M=5$), and for $\dim M=7$ in certain cases by the first author. We develop a bigraded
analog of Tanaka's prolongation procedure to construct a canonical absolute parallelism for these
CR structures in arbitrary (odd) dimension with Levi kernel of arbitrary admissible dimension.
We introduce the notion of a bigraded Tanaka symbol. Under regularity assumption that the symbol
is a Lie algebra, we define a bigraded analog of the Tanaka universal algebraic prolongation and
prove that for any CR structure with a given regular symbol there exists a canonical absolute parallelism
on a bundle whose dimension is that of this bigraded prolongation. We show that there is a unique (up
to local equivalence) such CR structure whose algebra of infinitesimal symmetries has maximal
possible dimension, and the latter algebra is isomorphic to the real part of the bigraded prolongation
of the symbol. In the case of $1$-dimensional Levi kernel we classify all regular symbols and calculate
their bigraded prolongations. In this case the regular symbols can be subdivided into nilpotent,
strongly non-nilpotent and weakly non-nilpotent. The bigraded prolongation of strongly non-nilpotent
symbols is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{so}\left(m,\mathbb C\right)$ where $m=\tfrac{1}{2}(\dim
M+5)$. Any real form of this algebra, except $\mathfrak{so}\left(m\right)$ and $\mathfrak{so}\left(m-1,1\right)$,
corresponds to the real part of the bigraded prolongation of exactly one strongly non-nilpotent
symbol. However, for a fixed $\dim M\geq 7$ the dimension of the bigraded prolongations achieves
its maximum on one of the nilpotent regular symbols, and this maximal dimension is equal to $\tfrac{1}{4}(\dim
M-1)^2+7$.
