Recent breakthrough results in compressive sensing (CS) have established that many high dimensional
signals can be accurately recovered from a relatively small number of non-adaptive linear observations,
provided that the signals possess a sparse representation in some basis. Subsequent efforts have
shown that the performance of CS can be improved by exploiting additional structure in the locations
of the nonzero signal coefficients during inference, or by utilizing some form of data-dependent
adaptive measurement focusing during the sensing process. To our knowledge, our own previous work
was the first to establish the potential benefits that can be achieved when fusing the notions of
adaptive sensing and structured sparsity -- that work examined the task of support recovery from
noisy linear measurements, and established that an adaptive sensing strategy specifically tailored
to signals that are tree-sparse can significantly outperform adaptive and non-adaptive sensing
strategies that are agnostic to the underlying structure. In this work we establish fundamental
performance limits for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals from noisy measurements,
in settings where measurements may be obtained either non-adaptively (using a randomized Gaussian
measurement strategy motivated by initial CS investigations) or by any adaptive sensing strategy.
Our main results here imply that the adaptive tree sensing procedure analyzed in our previous work
is nearly optimal, in the sense that no other sensing and estimation strategy can perform fundamentally
better for identifying the support of tree-sparse signals.
