Parabolic optimal control problems with control constraints are generally challenging, from
either theoretical analysis or algorithmic design perspectives. Conceptually, the well-known
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) can be directly applied to such a problem. An
attractive advantage of this direct ADMM application is that the control constraint can be untied
from the parabolic PDE constraint; these two inherently different constraints thus can be treated
individually in iterations. At each iteration of the ADMM, the main computation is for solving an
unconstrained parabolic optimal control problem. Because of its high dimensionality after discretization,
the unconstrained parabolic optimal control problem at each iteration can be solved only inexactly
by implementing certain numerical scheme internally and thus a two-layer nested iterative scheme
is required. It then becomes important to find an easily implementable and efficient inexactness
criterion to execute the internal iterations, and to prove the overall convergence rigorously
for the resulting two-layer nested iterative scheme. To implement the ADMM efficiently, we propose
an inexactness criterion that is independent of the mesh size of the involved discretization, and
it can be executed automatically with no need to set empirically perceived constant accuracy a prior.
The inexactness criterion turns out to allow us to solve the resulting unconstrained optimal control
problems to medium or even low accuracy and thus saves computation significantly, yet convergence
of the overall two-layer nested iterative scheme can be still guaranteed rigorously. Efficiency
of this ADMM implementation is promisingly validated by preliminary numerical results. Our methodology
can also be extended to a range of optimal control problems constrained by other linear PDEs such
as elliptic equations and hyperbolic equations.
