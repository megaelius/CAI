In a previous paper, the author considered several conditions for effective zero-dimensionality
of a computable metric space $X$; each of the (classically equivalent) properties of having vanishing
small or large inductive dimension, or covering dimension, or having a countable basis of clopen
sets, can be interpreted as multi-valued operations, and the computability of these operations
was shown to be mutually equivalent. If one fixes a represented set of at-most-zero-dimensional
subspaces, suitable uniform versions of some of the implications in the equivalence also hold.
In this paper, we show for closed at-most-zero-dimensional subspaces with some negative information,
we again have equivalence of computability of the operations considered (thus there is a robust
notion of `uniform effective zero-dimensionality' for such classes of subsets). We also extend
a retract characterization of effective zero-dimensionality from our earlier paper (recall a
space is zero-dimensional iff every nonempty closed subset of it is a retract of the space) to closed
subspaces. While, in the converse direction, local compactness \& bilocated sets are still used,
in the forward direction the new, relative version of this result has a simpler proof (even when the
subspace coincides with the whole space) and no compactness assumption. Actually, this proof relates
to so-called Dugundji systems; we elaborate both a general construction of such systems for a proper
nonempty closed subspace (using a computable form of countable paracompactness), and modifications:
to make the sets pairwise disjoint if the subspace is zero-dimensional, or to avoid the restriction
to proper subspaces. In a different direction, our second theorem applies in $p$-adic analysis
the ideas of the first theorem to compute a more general form of retraction, given a Dugundji system
(possibly without disjointness).
