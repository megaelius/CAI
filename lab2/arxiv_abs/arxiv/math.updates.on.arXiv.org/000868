Variational methods in imaging are nowadays developing towards a quite universal and flexible
tool, allowing for highly successful approaches on tasks like denoising, deblurring, inpainting,
segmentation, super-resolution, disparity, and optical flow estimation. The overall structure
of such approaches is of the form ${\cal D}(Ku) + \alpha {\cal R} (u) \rightarrow \min_u$ ; where the
functional ${\cal D}$ is a data fidelity term also depending on some input data $f$ and measuring
the deviation of $Ku$ from such and ${\cal R}$ is a regularization functional. Moreover $K$ is a (often
linear) forward operator modeling the dependence of data on an underlying image, and $\alpha$ is
a positive regularization parameter. While ${\cal D}$ is often smooth and (strictly) convex, the
current practice almost exclusively uses nonsmooth regularization functionals. The majority
of successful techniques is using nonsmooth and convex functionals like the total variation and
generalizations thereof or $\ell_1$-norms of coefficients arising from scalar products with
some frame system. The efficient solution of such variational problems in imaging demands for appropriate
algorithms. Taking into account the specific structure as a sum of two very different terms to be
minimized, splitting algorithms are a quite canonical choice. Consequently this field has revived
the interest in techniques like operator splittings or augmented Lagrangians. Here we shall provide
an overview of methods currently developed and recent results as well as some computational studies
providing a comparison of different methods and also illustrating their success in applications.
