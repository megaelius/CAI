Quantum information science strives to leverage the quantum-mechanical nature of our universe
in order to achieve large improvements in certain information processing tasks. In deep-space
optical communications, current receivers for the pure-state classical-quantum channel first
measure each qubit channel output and then classically post-process the measurements. This approach
is sub-optimal. In this dissertation we investigate a recently proposed quantum algorithm for
this task, which is inspired by classical belief-propagation algorithms, and analyze its performance
on a simple $5$-bit code. We show that the algorithm is optimal for each bit and it appears to achieve
optimal performance when deciding the full transmitted message. We also provide explicit circuits
for the algorithm in terms of standard gates. This suggests a near-term quantum communication advantage
over the aforementioned sub-optimal scheme. Quantum error correction is vital to building a universal
fault-tolerant quantum computer. We propose an efficient algorithm that can translate a given
logical Clifford operation on a stabilizer code into all (equivalence classes of) physical Clifford
circuits that realize that operation. In order to achieve universality, one also needs to implement
at least one non-Clifford logical operation. So, we develop a mathematical framework for a large
subset of diagonal operations in the Clifford hierarchy, which we call Quadratic Form Diagonal
(QFD) gates. Then we use the QFD formalism to characterize all stabilizer codes whose code spaces
are preserved under the transversal action of the non-Clifford $T$ gates on the physical qubits.
We also discuss a few purely-classical coding problems motivated by transversal $T$ gates. A conscious
effort has been made to keep this dissertation self-contained, by including necessary background
material on quantum information and computation.
