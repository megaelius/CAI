We develop a unified continuum modeling framework for viscous fluids and hyperelastic solids using
the Gibbs free energy as the thermodynamic potential. This framework naturally leads to a pressure
primitive variable formulation for the continuum body, which is well-behaved in both compressible
and incompressible regimes. Our derivation also provides a rational justification of the isochoric-volumetric
additive split of free energies in nonlinear continuum mechanics. The variational multiscale
analysis is performed for the continuum model to construct a foundation for numerical discretization.
We first consider the continuum body instantiated as a hyperelastic material and develop a variational
multiscale formulation for the hyper-elastodynamic problem. The generalized-alpha method is
applied for temporal discretization. A segregated algorithm for the nonlinear solver is designed
and carefully analyzed. Second, we apply the new formulation to construct a novel unified formulation
for fluid-solid coupled problems. The variational multiscale formulation is utilized for spatial
discretization in both fluid and solid subdomains. The generalized-alpha method is applied for
the whole continuum body, and optimal high-frequency dissipation is achieved in both fluid and
solid subproblems. A new predictor multi-corrector algorithm is developed based on the segregated
algorithm to attain a good balance between robustness and efficiency. The efficacy of the new formulations
is examined in several benchmark problems. The results indicate that the proposed modeling and
numerical methodologies constitute a promising technology for biomedical and engineering applications,
particularly those necessitating incompressible models.
