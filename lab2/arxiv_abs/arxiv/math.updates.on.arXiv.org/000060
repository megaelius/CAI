For every integer $k\meg 2$ let $[k]^{<\nn}$ be the set of all \textit{words} over $k$, that is,
all finite sequences having values in [k]:=\{1,...,k\}$. A \textit{Carlson-Simpson tree} of
$[k]^{<\nn}$ of dimension $m\meg 1$ is a subset of $[k]^{<\nn}$ of the form \[ \{w\}\cup \big\{w^{\con}w_0(a_0)^{\con}...^{\con}w_{n}(a_n):
n\in \{0,...,m-1\} \text{and} a_0,...,a_n\in [k]\big\} \] where $w$ is a word over $k$ and $(w_n)_{n=0}^{m-1}$
is a finite sequence of left variable words over $k$. We study the behavior of a family of measurable
events in a probability space indexed by the elements of a Carlson-Simpson tree of sufficiently
large dimension. Specifically we show the following. \medskip \noindent \textit{For every integer
$k\meg 2$, every $0<\ee\mik 1$ and every integer $n\meg 1$ there exists a strictly positive constant
$\theta(k,\ee,n)$ with the following property. If $m$ is a given positive integer, then there exists
an integer $\mathrm{Cor}(k,\ee,m)$ such that for every Carlson--Simpson tree $T$ of $[k]^{<\nn}$
of dimension at least $\mathrm{Cor}(k,\ee,m)$ and every family $\{A_t:t\in T\}$ of measurable
events in a probability space $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$ satisfying $\mu(A_t)\meg \ee$ for every
$t\in T$, there exists a Carlson--Simpson tree $S$ of dimension $m$ with $S\subseteq T$ and such
that for every nonempty $F\subseteq S$ we have} \[\mu\Big(\bigcap_{t\in F} A_t\Big) \meg \theta(k,\ee,|F|).
\] The proof is based, among others, on the density version of the Carlson--Simpson Theorem established
recently by the authors, as well as, on a refinement -- of independent interest -- of a partition result
due to H. Furstenberg and Y. Katznelson. The argument is effective and yields explicit lower bounds
for the constants $\theta(k,\ee,n)$.
