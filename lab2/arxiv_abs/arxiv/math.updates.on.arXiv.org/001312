A classical difficult isomorphism testing problem is to test isomorphism of p-groups of class 2
and exponent p in time polynomial in the group order. It is known that this problem can be reduced to
solving the alternating matrix space isometry problem over a finite field in time polynomial in
the underlying vector space size. We propose a venue of attack for the latter problem by viewing it
as a linear algebraic analogue of the graph isomorphism problem. This viewpoint leads us to explore
the possibility of transferring techniques for graph isomorphism to this long-believed bottleneck
case of group isomorphism. In 1970's, Babai, Erd\H{o}s, and Selkow presented the first average-case
efficient graph isomorphism testing algorithm (SIAM J Computing, 1980). Inspired by that algorithm,
we devise an average-case efficient algorithm for the alternating matrix space isometry problem
over a key range of parameters, in a random model of alternating matrix spaces in vein of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
model of random graphs. For this, we develop a linear algebraic analogue of the classical individualisation
technique, a technique belonging to a set of combinatorial techniques that has been critical for
the progress on the worst-case time complexity for graph isomorphism, but was missing in the group
isomorphism context. As a consequence of the main algorithm, we establish a weaker linear algebraic
analogue of Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi's classical result that most graphs have the trivial automorphism
group. We finally show that Luks' dynamic programming technique for graph isomorphism (STOC 1999)
can be adapted to slightly improve the worst-case time complexity of the alternating matrix space
isometry problem in a certain range of parameters.
