In 2007, Carlet and Ding introduced two parameters, denoted by $Nb_F$ and $NB_F$, quantifying respectively
the balancedness of general functions $F$ between finite Abelian groups and the (global) balancedness
of their derivatives $D_a F(x)=F(x+a)-F(x)$, $a\in G\setminus\{0\}$ (providing an indicator
of the nonlinearity of the functions). These authors studied the properties and cryptographic
significance of these two measures. They provided for S-boxes inequalities relating the nonlinearity
$\mathcal{NL}(F)$ to $NB_F$, and obtained in particular an upper bound on the nonlinearity which
unifies Sidelnikov-Chabaud-Vaudenay's bound and the covering radius bound. At the Workshop WCC
2009 and in its postproceedings in 2011, a further study of these parameters was made; in particular,
the first parameter was applied to the functions $F+L$ where $L$ is affine, providing more nonlinearity
parameters. In 2010, motivated by the study of Costas arrays, two parameters called ambiguity and
deficiency were introduced by Panario \emph{et al.} for permutations over finite Abelian groups
to measure the injectivity and surjectivity of the derivatives respectively. These authors also
studied some fundamental properties and cryptographic significance of these two measures. Further
studies followed without that the second pair of parameters be compared to the first one. In the present
paper, we observe that ambiguity is the same parameter as $NB_F$, up to additive and multiplicative
constants (i.e. up to rescaling). We make the necessary work of comparison and unification of the
results on $NB_F$, respectively on ambiguity, which have been obtained in the five papers devoted
to these parameters. We generalize some known results to any Abelian groups and we more importantly
derive many new results on these parameters.
