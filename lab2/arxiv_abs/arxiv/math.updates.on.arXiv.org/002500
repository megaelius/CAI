The purpose of the current text is twofold. First, given any profinite group topologically of finite
generation, $G$, we construct the moduli stack parametrizing rank $n$ continuous $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-representations
of $G$, where $\ell$ not necessarily distinct from $p$, $\mathrm{Rep}^{\mathrm{cont}}_{G,n}$
as a non-archimedean geometric $ \mathbb{Q}_\ell$-stack. Our construction is explicit in the
sense that we construct a smooth $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ atlas for such moduli space, in a similar fashion
to the usual construction when $G$ is a discrete group. This provides a positive answer to the existence
of the moduli space of $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-adic lisse sheaves on a smooth and proper curve $\mathcal{X}$
over an algebraically closed field, whose existence was conjectured by P. Deligne. The second part
of the paper concerns the study of the $\infty$-category of (derived) continuous $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-adic
representations of a profinite space $X \in \mathcal{S}^{\mathrm{pro}( \mathrm{fc})}$. When
$X \simeq \acute{\mathrm{E}} \mathrm{t} ( \mathcal{X})$ is the \'etale homotopy type of $\mathcal{X}$
such $\infty$-cateogry coincides with the $\infty$-category of derived $\mathbb{Q} _\ell$-adic
\'etale lisse sheaves on $\mathcal{X}_{\mathrm{e} \mathrm{t}}$. Consider the case $G = \pi_1^{\text{et}}(\mathcal{X})$
and $X \simeq \mathrm{E} \mathrm{t} ( \mathcal{X})$. By restricting our attention to the associated
derived analytic $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-stack spanned by those rank $n$ continuous representations
we upgrade $\mathrm{Rep}^{\mathrm{cont}}_{G,n}$ into a derived $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-analytic
stack, $\mathcal{R}\mathrm{ep}^{\mathrm{cont}}_{X, n }$. Moreover, we verify the hypothesis
of the representability theorem in the setting of derived $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-geometry, thus showing
that $\mathcal{R}\mathrm{ep}^{\mathrm{cont}}_{X, n }$ is geometric.
