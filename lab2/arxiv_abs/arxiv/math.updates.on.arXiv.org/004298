Anti-elementarity is a strong way of ensuring that a class of structures, in a given first-order
language, is not closed under elementary equivalence with respect to any infinitary language of
the form $\mathscr{L}_{\infty\lambda}$. We prove that many naturally defined classes are anti-elementary,
including the following: $\bullet$ the class of all lattices of finitely generated convex $\ell$-subgroups
of members of any class of $\ell$-groups containing all Archimedean $\ell$-groups; $\bullet$
the class of all semilattices of finitely generated $\ell$-ideals of members of any nontrivial
quasivariety of $\ell$-groups; $\bullet$ the class of all Stone duals of spectra of MV-algebras-this
yields a negative solution for the MV-spectrum Problem; $\bullet$ the class of all semilattices
of finitely generated two-sided ideals of rings; $\bullet$ the class of all semilattices of finitely
generated submodules of modules; $\bullet$ the class of all monoids encoding the nonstable K\_0-theory
of von Neumann regular rings, respectively C*-algebras of real rank zero; $\bullet$ (assuming
arbitrarily large Erd\"os cardinals) the class of all coordinatizable sectionally complemented
modular lattices with a large 4-frame. The main underlying principle is that under quite general
conditions, for a functor $\Phi : \mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$, if there exists a non-commutative
diagram D of A, indexed by a common sort of poset called an almost join-semilattice, such that $\bullet$
$\Phi\vec{D}^I$ is a commutative diagram for every set I, $\bullet$ $\Phi\vec{D}$ is not isomorphic
to $\Phi\vec{X}$ for any commutative diagram $\vec{X}$ in $\mathcal{A}$, then the range of $\Phi$
is anti-elementary.
