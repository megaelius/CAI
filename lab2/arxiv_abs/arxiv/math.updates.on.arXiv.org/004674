In this paper, two flux-only least-squares finite element methods (LSFEM) for the linear hyperbolic
transport problem are developed. The transport equation often has discontinuous solutions and
discontinuous inflow boundary conditions, but the normal component of the flux across the mesh
interfaces is continuous. In traditional LSFEMs, the continuous finite element space is used to
approximate the solution. This will cause unnecessary error around the discontinuity and serious
overshooting. In arXiv:1807.01524 [math.NA], we reformulate the equation by introducing a new
flux variable to separate the continuity requirements of the flux and the solution. Realizing that
the Raviart-Thomas mixed element space has enough degrees of freedom to approximate both the flux
and its divergence, we eliminate the solution from the system and get two flux-only formulations,
and develop corresponding LSFEMs. The solution then is recovered by simple post-processing methods
using its relation with the flux. These two versions of flux-only LSFEMs use less DOFs than the method
we developed in arXiv:1807.01524 [math.NA]. Similar to the LSFEM developed in arXiv:1807.01524
[math.NA], both flux-only LSFEMs can handle discontinuous solutions better than the traditional
continuous polynomial approximations. We show the existence, uniqueness, a priori and a posteriori
error estimates of the proposed methods. With adaptive mesh refinements driven by the least-squares
a posteriori error estimators, the solution can be accurately approximated even when the mesh is
not aligned with discontinuity. The overshooting phenomenon is very mild if a piecewise constant
reconstruction of the solution is used. Extensive numerical tests are done to show the effectiveness
of the methods developed in the paper.
