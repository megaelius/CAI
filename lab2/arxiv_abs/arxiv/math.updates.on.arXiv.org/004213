Direct computer simulation of intense tropical cyclones (TCs) in weather models is limited by computational
expense. Intense TCs are rare and have small-scale structures, making it difficult to produce large
ensembles of storms at high resolution. Further, models often fail to capture the process of rapid
intensification, which is a distinguishing feature of many intense TCs. Understanding rapid intensification
is especially important in the context of global warming, which may increase the frequency of intense
TCs. To better leverage computational resources for the study of rapid intensification, we introduce
an action minimization algorithm applied to the WRF and WRFPLUS models. Action minimization nudges
the model into forming more intense TCs than it otherwise would; it does so via the maximum likelihood
path in a stochastic formulation of the model, thereby allowing targeted study of intensification
mechanisms. We apply action minimization to simulations of Hurricanes Danny (2015) and Fred (2009)
at 6 km resolution to demonstrate that the algorithm consistently intensifies TCs via physically
plausible pathways. We show an approximately ten-fold computational savings using action minimization
to study the tail of the TC intensification distribution. Further, for Hurricanes Danny and Fred,
action minimization produces perturbations that preferentially reduce low-level shear as compared
to upper-level shear, at least above a threshold of approximately $4 \mathrm{\ m \ s^{-1}}$. We also
demonstrate that asymmetric, time-dependent patterns of heating can cause significant TC intensification
beyond symmetric, azimuthally-averaged heating and find a regime of non-linear response to asymmetric
heating that has not been extensively studied in previous work.
