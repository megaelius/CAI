One presents a simple Set Theory Model (STM) of the valid categorical arguments (VCAs) - a proper
superset of the valid (categorical) syllogisms (VS). The main STM initiator was George Boole, who
worked with a universe of discourse, U, which contains the pairwise complementary sets, or categorical
terms, S, non-S, P, non-P, M, non-M, and is thus partitioned into eight subsets: SPM, SP(non-M),...,(non-S)(non-P)(non-M),
where the intersection was denoted by adjacency. In STM all superfluous syllogistic figures are
disregarded, and both the positive terms, S, P, M, and the negative terms, non-S, non-P, non-M, are
allowed to appear in the pairs of categorical premises (PCPs) and their entailed logical consequences
(LCs). This increases the number of distinct P (resp. S) premises from the six formulable via only
positive terms, to eight, and the number of distinct PCPs from the 36 appearing in the Classical Categorical
Syllogistic (CCS), to the 64 appearing in the STM. Out of the latter 64 PCPs, only 32 PCPs entail LCs
and thus generate VCAs. These VCAs, (and the VS), split into four types. Each type contains eight
VCAs. Any VCA can be re-written as any other VCA of the same type, via a group G of eight re-labelings.
Thus the VCAs Barbara, Darapti, Darii, Disamis, can be chosen as type representatives for both VCAs
and VS, and via a term relabeling, any VCA or VS can be re-written, without changing their PCP or LC
contents, as either a Barbara, Darapti, Darii, or Disamis. One discusses the VCAs and their LCs,
simple/biliteral VCA sorites, empty set constraints (ESC), VCA distribution conservation, and
other Rules of Valid Categorical Arguments (RofVCA) which are VCA generalized versions of some
of the Rules of Valid Syllogisms (RofVS). Note that CCS restricts the VS to only LCs of the formats
A(S,P), E(S,P), I(S,P), O(S,P).
