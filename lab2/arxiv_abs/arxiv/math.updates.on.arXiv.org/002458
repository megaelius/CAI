In the inference attacks studied in Quantitative Information Flow (QIF), the attacker typically
tries to interfere with the system in the attempt to increase its leakage of secret information.
The defender, on the other hand, typically tries to decrease leakage by introducing some controlled
noise. This noise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a probabilistic
choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of leakage depends heavily on whether
or not this choice is visible to the attacker. In this work, we consider operators for modeling visible
and hidden choice in protocol composition, and we study their algebraic properties. We then formalize
the interplay between defender and attacker in a game-theoretic framework adapted to the specific
issues of QIF, where the payoff is information leakage. We consider various kinds of leakage games,
depending on whether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether or not the choices
of the defender are visible to the attacker. In the case of sequential games, the choice of the second
player is generally a function of the choice of the first player, and his/her probabilistic choice
can be either over the possible functions (mixed strategy) or it can be on the result of the function
(behavioral strategy). We show that when the attacker moves first in a sequential game with a hidden
choice, then behavioral strategies are more advantageous for the defender than mixed strategies.
This contrasts with the standard game theory, where the two types of strategies are equivalent.
Finally, we establish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information leakage and provide
methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of equilibrium) for both attacker and defender
in the various cases.
