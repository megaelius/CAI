We review the modern classical electrodynamics problems and present the related main fundamental
principles characterizing the electrodynamical vacuum-field structure. We analyze the models
of the vacuum field medium and charged point particle dynamics using the developed field theory
concepts. There is also described a new approach to the classical Maxwell theory based on the derived
and newly interpreted basic equations making use of the vacuum field theory approach. In particular,
there are obtained the main classical special relativity theory relations and their new explanations.
The well known Feynman approach to Maxwell electromagnetic equations and the Lorentz type force
derivation is also discussed in detail. A related charged point particle dynamics and a hadronic
string model analysis is also presented. We also revisited and reanalyzed the classical Lorentz
force expression in arbitrary non-inertial reference frames and present some new interpretations
of the relations between special relativity theory and its quantum mechanical aspects. Some results
related with the charge particle radiation problem and the magnetic potential topological aspects
are discussed. The electromagnetic Dirac-Fock-Podolsky problem of the Maxwell and Yang-Mills
type dynamical systems is analyzed within the classical Dirac-Marsden-Weinstein symplectic
reduction theory. The problem of constructing Fock type representations and retrieving their
creation-annihilation operator structure is analyzed. An application of the suitable current
algebra representation to describing the non-relativistic Aharonov-Bohm paradox is presented.
The current algebra coherent functional representations are constructed and their importance
subject to the linearization problem of nonlinear dynamical systems in Hilbert spaces is demonstrated.
