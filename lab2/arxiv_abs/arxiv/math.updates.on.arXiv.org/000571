We would like to develop model theory for T, a complete theory in L_{theta,theta}(tau) when theta
is a compact cardinal. We have bare bones stability theory and it seemed we can go no further. Dealing
with ultrapowers (and ultraproducts) naturally we restrict ourselves to "D a theta-complete ultrafilter
on I, probably (I,theta)-regular". The basic theorems work and can be generalized (like Los theorem),
but can we generalize deeper parts of model theory? In particular, can we generalize stability enough
to generalize [Sh:c, Ch. VI]? Let us concentrate on saturated in the local sense (types consisting
of instances of one formula). We prove that at least we can characterize the T's (of cardinality <
theta for simplicity) which are minimal for appropriate cardinal lambda > 2^kappa +|T| in each
of the following two senses. One is generalizing Keisler order which measures how saturated are
ultrapowers. Another asks: Is there an L_{theta,theta}-theory T_1 supseteq T of cardinality |T|
+ 2^theta such that for every model M_1 of T_1 of cardinality > lambda, the tau(T)-reduct M of M_1
is lambda^+-saturated. Moreover, the two versions of stable used in the characterization are different.
Further we succeed to connect our investigation with the logic L^1_{< theta} introduced in [Sh:797]
proving it satisfies several parallel of classical theorems on first order logic, strengthening
the thesis that it is a natural logic. In particular, two models are L^1_{<theta}-equivalent
iff for some omega-sequence of theta-complete ultrafilters, the iterated ultra-powers by it of
those two models are isomorphic.
