The degeneracies of single-centered dyonic $\frac14$-BPS black holes (BH) in Type II string theory
on K3$\times T^2$ are known to be coefficients of certain mock Jacobi forms arising from the Igusa
cusp form $\Phi_{10}$. In this paper we present an exact analytic formula for these BH degeneracies
purely in terms of the degeneracies of the perturbative $\frac12$-BPS states of the theory. We use
the fact that the degeneracies are completely controlled by the polar coefficients of the mock Jacobi
forms, using the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher circle method. Here we present a simple formula for
these polar coefficients as a quadratic function of the $\frac12$-BPS degeneracies. We arrive
at the formula by using the physical interpretation of polar coefficients as negative discriminant
states, and then making use of previous results in the literature to track the decay of such states
into pairs of $\frac12$-BPS states in the moduli space. Although there are an infinite number of
such decays, we show that only a finite number of them contribute to the formula. The phenomenon of
BH bound state metamorphosis (BSM) plays a crucial role in our analysis. We show that the dyonic BSM
orbits with $U$-duality invariant $\Delta<0$ are in exact correspondence with the solution sets
of the Brahmagupta-Pell equation, which implies that they are isomorphic to the group of units in
the order $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{|\Delta|}]$ in the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{|\Delta|})$.
We check our formula against the known numerical data arising from the Igusa cusp form, for the first
1650 polar coefficients, and find perfect agreement.
