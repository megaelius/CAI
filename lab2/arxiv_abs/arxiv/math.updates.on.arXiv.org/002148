Radio waves carry both energy and information simultaneously. Nevertheless, Radio-Frequency
(RF) transmission of these quantities have traditionally been treated separately. Currently,
we are experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely unifying wireless transmission
of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiations as well as the network
infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. In this paper, we review and
discuss recent progress on laying the foundations of the envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing
a signal theory and design for Wireless Information and Power Transmission (WIPT) and identifying
the fundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. We start with an
overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power
Transfer (SWIPT),Wirelessly Powered Communication Network (WPCN), and Wirelessly Powered Backscatter
Communication (WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal and system
designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model. To that end, we highlight
three different energy harvester models, namely one linear model and two nonlinear models, and
show how WIPT designs differ for each of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics
discussed include rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiver architecture,
waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distribution optimizations, resource allocation,
and RF spectrum use. We discuss and check the validity of the different energy harvester models and
the resulting signal theory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation.
We also point out numerous directions that are promising for future research.
