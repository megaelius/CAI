We solve the regularity problem for Milnor's infinite dimensional Lie groups in the $C^0$-topological
context, and provide necessary and sufficient regularity conditions for the standard setting
($C^k$-topology). We prove that the evolution map is $C^0$-continuous on its domain $\textit{iff}\hspace{1pt}$
the Lie group $G$ is locally $\mu$-convex. We furthermore show that if the evolution map is defined
on all smooth curves, then $G$ is Mackey complete - This is a completeness condition formulated in
terms of the Lie group operations that generalizes Mackey completeness as defined for locally convex
vector spaces. Then, under the presumption that $G$ is locally $\mu$-convex, we show that each $C^k$-curve,
for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}\sqcup\{\mathrm{lip},\infty\}$, is integrable (contained in
the domain of the evolution map) $\textit{iff}\hspace{1pt}$ $G$ is Mackey complete and $\mathrm{k}$-confined.
The latter condition states that each $C^k$-curve in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ can be
uniformly approximated by a special type of sequence consisting of piecewise integrable curves
- A similar result is proven for the case $k\equiv 0$; and we provide several mild conditions that
ensure that $G$ is $\mathrm{k}$-confined for each $k\in \mathbb{N}\sqcup\{\mathrm{lip},\infty\}$.
We finally discuss the differentiation of parameter-dependent integrals in the standard topological
context. In particular, we show that if the evolution map is well defined and continuous on $C^k([0,1],\mathfrak{g})$
for $k\in \mathbb{N}\sqcup\{\infty\}$, then it is smooth thereon $\textit{iff}\hspace{1pt}$
$\mathfrak{g}$ is $\hspace{0.2pt}$ Mackey complete for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}\sqcup\{\infty\}$
$\hspace{1pt}/\hspace{1pt}$ integral complete for $k\equiv 0$. This result is obtained by calculating
the directional derivatives explicitly - recovering the standard formulas that hold in the Banach
case.
