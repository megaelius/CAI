Consider an affine Kac-Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$.
Given $\Lambda$ in the set $P_+$ of dominant integral weights of $\mathfrak{g}$, we denote by $L(\Lambda)$
the integrable highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module with highest weight $\Lambda$. For $\mu\in
\mathfrak{h}^*$, we denote by $L(\Lambda)_\mu$ the corresponding weight space. Consider the
support $\Gamma(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h})$ of the decompositions of the $L(\Lambda)$ as a
$\mathfrak{h}$-module: $$ \Gamma(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h})=\{(\Lambda,\mu)\,:\, L(\Lambda)_\mu\neq\{0\}\}.
$$ Consider now the winding subalgebra $\mathfrak{g}[u]$ (for some positive integer $u$). The
winding subalgebra $\mathfrak{g}[u]$ is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{g}$ but with a nontrivial embedding
in $\mathfrak{g}$ depending on the parameter $u$. Given $\lambda$ in the set $\dot{P}_+$ of dominant
integral weights of $\mathfrak{g}[u]$, we denote by $\dot{L}(\lambda)$ the integrable highest
weight $\mathfrak{g}[u]$-module with highest weight $\lambda$. Then the $\mathfrak{g}$-module
$L(\Lambda)$ decomposes as a direct sums of simple $\mathfrak{g}[u]$-modules $\dot{L}(\lambda)$
with finite multiplicities. In this paper, we are interested in the supports of this decomposition,
i.e., the set of pairs $(\Lambda,\lambda)$ in $P_+ \times \dot{P}_+$ such that the integrable highest
weight $\mathfrak{g}[u]$-modules $\dot{L}(\lambda)$ is a submodule of $L(\Lambda)$. We show
that both $\Gamma(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h})$ and $\Gamma(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}[u])$
are semigroups. Moreover, for the cases $A^{(1)}_1$ and $A^{(2)}_2$, we determine explicitly
$\Gamma(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h})$. Finally, we describe explicit subsets of $P_+ \times
\dot{P}_+$ where the two semigroups coincide.
