In an earlier paper, we constructed the genus-two amplitudes for five external massless states
in Type II and Heterotic string theory, and showed that the alpha' expansion of the Type II amplitude
reproduces the corresponding supergravity amplitude to leading order. In this paper, we analyze
the effective interactions induced by Type IIB superstrings beyond supergravity, both for U(1)_R-preserving
amplitudes such as for five gravitons, and for U(1)_R-violating amplitudes such as for one dilaton
and four gravitons. At each order in alpha', the coefficients of the effective interactions are
given by integrals over moduli space of genus-two modular graph functions, generalizing those
already encountered for four external massless states. To leading and sub-leading orders, the
coefficients of the effective interactions D^2 R^5 and D^4 R^5 are found to match those of D^4 R^4
and D^6 R^4, respectively, as required by non-linear supersymmetry. To the next order, a D^6 R^5
effective interaction arises, which is independent of the supersymmetric completion of D^8 R^4,
and already arose at genus one. A novel identity on genus-two modular graph functions, which we prove,
ensures that up to order D^6 R^5, the five-point amplitudes require only a single new modular graph
function in addition to those needed for the four-point amplitude. We check that the supergravity
limit of U(1)_R-violating amplitudes is free of UV divergences to this order, consistently with
the known structure of divergences in Type IIB supergravity. Our results give strong consistency
tests on the full five-point amplitude, and pave the way for understanding S-duality beyond the
BPS-protected sector.
