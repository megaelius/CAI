Rank Decoding (RD) is the main underlying problem in rank-based cryptography. Based on this problem
and quasi-cyclic versions of it, very efficient schemes have been proposed recently, such as those
in the ROLLO and RQC submissions, which have reached the second round of the NIST Post-Quantum competition.
Two main approaches have been studied to solve RD: combinatorial ones and algebraic ones. While
the former has been studied extensively, a better understanding of the latter was recently obtained
by Bardet et al. (EUROCRYPT20) where it appeared that algebraic attacks can often be more efficient
than combinatorial ones for cryptographic parameters. This paper gives substantial improvements
upon this attack in terms both of complexity and of the assumptions required by the cryptanalysis.
We present attacks for ROLLO-I-128, 192, and 256 with bit complexity respectively in 70, 86, and
158, to be compared to 117, 144, and 197 for the aforementionned previous attack. Moreover, unlike
that previous attack, the new one does not rely on Gr\"obner basis computations and thus does not
require any assumption. For a case called overdetermined, this modeling allows us to avoid Gr\"obner
basis computations by going directly to solving a linear system. For the other case, called underdetermined,
we also improve the results from the previous attack by combining the Ourivski-Johansson modeling
together with a new modeling for a generic MinRank instance; the latter modeling allows us to refine
the analysis of MinRank's complexity given in the paper by Verbel et al. (PQC19). Finally, since
the proposed parameters of ROLLO and RQC are completely broken by our new attack, we give examples
of new parameters for ROLLO and RQC that make them resistant to our attacks. These new parameters
show that these systems remain attractive, with a loss of only about 50\% in terms of key size for ROLLO-I.
