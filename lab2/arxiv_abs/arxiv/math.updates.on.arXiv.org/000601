In this paper, we solve a basic problem of whether there are algorithms to determine the observability
of Boolean control networks (BCNs). In fact, we give a unified approach to design algorithms to judge
whether a given BCN is observable with respect to all different observability. In this work, an algorithm
to determine the observability of BCNs is a deterministic mechanical procedure that receives a
BCN and after a finite number of processing steps, it returns "Yes", if the BCN is observable; and
returns "No", otherwise. The observability we mainly investigate are the most general observability
that is proposed in this paper, i.e., any two distinct initial states can be distinguished by a designed
input sequence, and the observability proposed in [D. Cheng, H. Qi (2009). Controllability and
observability of Boolean control networks, Automatica, 45(7), 1659--1667.], [D. Cheng, Y. Zhao
(2011). Identification of Boolean control networks, Automatica, 47, 702--710.] and [E. Fornasini,
M. Valcher (2013). Observability, reconstructibility and state observers of Boolean control
networks, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 58(6), 1390--1401.], respectively. With respect to each
of the four observability, we give the following results. First, we give the implication relationships
between them, and prove that every two of them are not equivalent. Second, we put forward a concept
of weighted pair graphs for BCNs, using which, based on the theories of finite automata and formal
languages, we give equivalent test criteria for the observability and design algorithms to determine
the observability of BCNs. Lastly, we present methods to determine the initial state, using which
we also obtain an upper bound on the smallest length of input/output pair sequences that determine
the initial state.
