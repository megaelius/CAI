Inspired by the concepts of deep learning in artificial intelligence and fairness in behavioural
economics, we introduce deep teams in this paper. In such systems, agents are partitioned into a
few sub-populations so that the dynamics and cost of agents in each sub-population is invariant
to the indexing of agents. The goal of agents is to minimize a common cost function in such a manner
that the agents in each sub-population are not discriminated or privileged by the way they are indexed.
Two non-classical information structures are studied. In the first one, each agent observes its
local state as well as the empirical distribution of the states of agents in each sub-population,
called deep state, whereas in the second one, the deep states of a subset (possibly all) of sub-populations
are not observed. Novel dynamic programs are developed to identify globally optimal and sub-optimal
solutions for the first and second information structures, respectively. The computational complexity
of finding the optimal solution in both space and time is polynomial (rather than exponential) with
respect to the number of agents in each sub-population and is linear (rather than exponential) with
respect to the control horizon. This complexity is further reduced in time by introducing a forward
equation, that we call deep Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, described by multiple convolutional
layers of Binomial probability distributions. Two different prices are defined for computation
and communication, and it is shown that under mild assumptions they converge to zero as the quantization
level and the number of agents tend to infinity. In addition, the main results are extended to the
infinite-horizon discounted model and arbitrarily asymmetric cost function. Finally, a service-management
example with 200 users is presented.
