An elegant and fruitful way to bring harmonic analysis into the theory of orthogonal polynomials
and special functions---or, from the opposite point of view, to associate certain Banach algebras
with orthogonal polynomials satisfying a specific (but frequently satisfied) nonnegative linearization
property---is the concept of a polynomial hypergroup. Polynomial hypergroups (or the underlying
polynomials, respectively) are accompanied by $L^1$-algebras and a rich, well-developed and
unified harmonic analysis. However, the individual behavior strongly depends on the underlying
polynomials. We study two classes which are very different to each other, in particular with regard
to amenability properties of the corresponding $L^1$-algebras: concerning the little $q$-Legendre
polynomials, which are orthogonal with respect to a purely discrete measure and whose $L^1$-algebras
have been known to be right character amenable, we will show that the $L^1$-algebras are spanned
by their idempotents and hence also weakly amenable. Concerning the associated symmetric Pollaczek
polynomials, which are a two-parameter generalization of the ultraspherical polynomials and
come with an absolutely continuous measure, we will provide complete characterizations of right
character amenability, weak amenability and point amenability (i.e., the global nonexistence
of nonzero bounded point derivations), and we shall see that there is a large parameter region for
which none of these amenability properties holds. While the crucial underlying nonnegative linearization
property has been known to be satisfied for the little $q$-Legendre polynomials, the analogue problem
for the associated symmetric Pollaczek polynomials will be solved in this paper. Our strategy relies
on chain sequences, continued fractions, Tur\'{a}n type inequalities, character estimations,
suitable transformations and asymptotic behavior.
