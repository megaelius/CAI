The local zero structure of a smooth map may qualitatively change, when the map is subjected to small
perturbations. The changes may include births and/or deaths of zeros. The qualitative properties
are defined as the invariances of an appropriate equivalence relation. The occurrence of a qualitative
change in the zero structures is called a bifurcation and the map is named a singularity. The local
bifurcation analysis of singularities has been extensively studied in singularity theory and
many powerful algebraic tools have been developed for their study. However, there does not exist
any symbolic computer-library for this purpose. We suitably generalize some powerful tools from
algebraic geometry for correct implementation of the results from singularity theory. We provide
some required criteria along with rigorous proofs for efficient and cognitive computer-implementation.
We have accordingly developed a Maple end-user friendly library, named "Singularity", for an efficient
and complete local bifurcation analysis of real zeros of scalar smooth maps. We have further constructed
a built-in help for Singularity and provided a comprehensive user-guide. Recent progresses in
Maple have been used so that Singularity generates the list of inequivalent persistent bifurcation
diagrams for parametric singularities. The approach is independent of the singularity's codimension
(a measure of its complexity) and works well for any scalar bifurcation problem with arbitrary codimension.
The main features of Singularity are briefly illustrated along with a few examples. Our Maple library
is not only useful for research goals and engineering applications involving singularities but
also for pedagogical purposes.
