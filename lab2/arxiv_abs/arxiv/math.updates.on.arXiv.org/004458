A central problem in orbit transfer optimization is to determine the number, time, direction and
magnitude of velocity impulses that minimize the total impulse. This problem was posed in 1967 by
T. N. Edelbaum, and while notable advances have been made, a rigorous means to answer Edelbaum's
question for multiple-revolution maneuvers has remained elusive for over five decades. We revisit
Edelbaum's question by taking a bottom-up approach to generate a minimum-fuel switching surface.
Sweeping through time profiles of the minimum-fuel switching function for increasing admissible
thrust magnitude, and in the high-thrust limit, we find that the continuous thrust switching surface
reveals the $N$-impulse solution. It is also shown that a \textit{fundamental} minimum-thrust
solution plays a pivotal role in our process to determine the optimal minimum-fuel maneuver for
all thrust levels. We find the answer to Edelbaum's question is not generally unique, but is frequently
a set of equal-$\Delta v$ extremals. We further find, when Edelbaum's question is refined to seek
the number of finite duration thrust arcs for a specific rocket engine, that a unique extremal is
usually found. Numerical results demonstrate the ideas and their utility for several interplanetary
and Earth-bound optimal transfers that consist of up to eleven impulses or, for finite thrust, short
thrust arcs. Another significant contribution of the paper can be viewed as a unification in astrodynamics
where the connection between impulsive and continuous-thrust trajectories are demonstrated
through the notion of \textit{optimal switching surfaces}
