A sum-dominant set is a finite set $A$ of integers such that $|A+A| > |A-A|$. As a typical pair of
elements contributes one sum and two differences, we expect sum-dominant sets to be rare in some
sense. In 2006, however, Martin and O'Bryant showed that the proportion of sum-dominant subsets
of $\{0,\dots,n\}$ is bounded below by a positive constant as $n\to\infty$. Hegarty then extended
their work and showed that for any prescribed $s,d\in\mathbb{N}_0$, the proportion $\rho^{s,d}_n$
of subsets of $\{0,\dots,n\}$ that are missing exactly $s$ sums in $\{0,\dots,2n\}$ and exactly
$2d$ differences in $\{-n,\dots,n\}$ also remains positive in the limit. We consider the following
question: are such sets, characterized by their sums and differences, similarly ubiquitous in
higher dimensional spaces? We generalize the integers in a growing interval to the lattice points
in a dilating polytope. Specifically, let $P$ be a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^D$ with vertices in $\mathbb{Z}^D$,
and let $\rho_n^{s,d}$ now denote the proportion of subsets of $L(nP)$ that are missing exactly
$s$ sums in $L(nP)+L(nP)$ and exactly $2d$ differences in $L(nP)-L(nP)$. As it turns out, the geometry
of $P$ has a significant effect on the limiting behavior of $\rho_n^{s,d}$. We define a geometric
characteristic of polytopes called local point symmetry, and show that $\rho_n^{s,d}$ is bounded
below by a positive constant as $n\to\infty$ if and only if $P$ is locally point symmetric. We further
show that the proportion of subsets in $L(nP)$ that are missing exactly $s$ sums and at least $2d$
differences remains positive in the limit, independent of the geometry of $P$. A direct corollary
of these results is that if $P$ is additionally point symmetric, the proportion of sum-dominant
subsets of $L(nP)$ also remains positive in the limit.
