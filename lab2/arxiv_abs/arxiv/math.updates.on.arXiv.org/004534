We consider the initial value problem for the generalized Allen-Cahn equation, \[\partial_t \Phi
= \Delta \Phi-\varepsilon^{-2} \Phi (\Phi^t \Phi - I), \qquad x \in \Omega, \ t\geq 0,\] where $\Phi$
is an $n\times n$ real matrix-valued field, $\Omega$ is a two-dimensional square with periodic
boundary conditions, and $\varepsilon > 0$. This equation is the gradient flow for the energy, $E(\Phi)
:= \int \frac{1}{2} \|\nabla \Phi \|^2_F+\frac{1}{4 \varepsilon^2} \| \Phi^t \Phi - I \|^2_F$,
where $\| \cdot \|_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm. The primary contribution of this paper is to use
asymptotic methods to describe the solution of this initial value problem. If the initial condition
has single-signed determinant, at each point of the domain, at a fast $O(\varepsilon^{-2} t)$ time
scale, the solution evolves towards the closest orthogonal matrix. Then, at the $O(t)$ time scale,
the solution evolves according to the $O_n$ diffusion equation. Stationary solutions to the $O_n$
diffusion equation are analyzed for $n=2$. If the initial condition has regions where the determinant
is positive and negative, a free interface develops. Away from the interface, in each region, the
matrix-valued field behaves as in the single-signed determinant case. At the $O(t)$ time scale,
the interface evolves in the normal direction by curvature. At a slow $O(\varepsilon t)$ time scale,
the interface is driven by curvature and the surface diffusion of the matrix-valued field. For $n=2$,
the interface is driven by curvature and the jump in the squared tangental derivative of the phase
across the interface. In particular, we emphasize that the interface when $n\geq 2$ is driven by
surface diffusion, while for $n=1$, the original Allen--Cahn equation, the interface is only driven
by mean curvature. A variety of numerical experiments are performed to verify, support, and illustrate
our analytical results.
