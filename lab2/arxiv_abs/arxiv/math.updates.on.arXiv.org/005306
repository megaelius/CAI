Among notions of detectability for a discrete-event system (DES), strong detectability implies
that after a finite number of observations to every output/label sequence generated by the DES,
the current state can be uniquely determined. This notion is strong so that by using it the current
state can be easily determined. In order to keep the advantage of strong detectability and weaken
its disadvantage, we can additionally take some "subsequent outputs" into account in order to determine
the current state. Such a modified observation will make some DES that is not strongly detectable
become "strongly detectable in a weaker sense", which we call "{\it $K$-delayed strong detectability}"
if we observe at least $K$ outputs after the time at which the state need to be determined. In this paper,
we study $K$-delayed strong detectability for DESs modeled by finite-state automata (FSAs), and
give a polynomial-time verification algorithm by using a novel concurrent-composition method.
Note that the algorithm applies to all FSAs. Also by the method, an upper bound for $K$ has been found,
and we also obtain polynomial-time verification algorithms for $(k_1,k_2)$-detectability and
$(k_1,k_2)$-D-detectability of FSAs firstly studied by [Shu and Lin, 2013]. Our algorithms run
in quartic polynomial time and apply to all FSAs, are more effective than the sextic polynomial-time
verification algorithms given by [Shu and Lin 2013] based on the usual assumptions of deadlock-freeness
and having no unobservable reachable cycle. Finally, we obtain polynomial-time synthesis algorithms
for enforcing delayed strong detectability, which are more effective than the exponential-time
synthesis algorithms in the supervisory control framework in the literature.
