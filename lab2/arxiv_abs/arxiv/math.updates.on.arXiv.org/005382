We introduce a specific functor $\pi$ that associates to any (noncommutative) algebra $A$ over
a field $\mathbb{K}$, a subalgebra $\pi(A)$. This functor is constructed by using the formal affine
ind-scheme of all paths $\mathbb{A}^1\to S$ from affine line into the (noncommutative) affine
scheme $S$ underlying $A$. The subalgebra $\pi(A)$ may be interpreted as the algebra of functions
over the formal affine scheme of path-connected components of $S$. Some basic properties of $\pi$
and of its finite variant $\pi^n$ are considered. Then, in the case that $\mathbb{K}$ is algebraically
closed, by using $\pi$ and a construction of mapping ind-schemes in terms of pro-algebras, we introduce
a bifunctor $\mathfrak{KK}$ that associates to any arbitrary pair $(A,B)$ of algebras, a pro pro-bialgebra
$\mathfrak{KK}(A,B)$, i.e. a pro pro-object of category of unital commutative algebras together
with cocommutative comultiplications and counits. The functor $\mathfrak{KK}$ may be interpreted
as a (dual) bivariant algebraic K-theory. It is shown that $\mathfrak{KK}$ is $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy
invariant, finite-matrix-stable at infinity, has a canonical co-bilinear Kasparov composition,
transforms direct sums in second component to tensor product, and satisfies in a specific exponential
law. It is shown that for any unital algebra $B$, there is a canonical homomorphism from $\mathcal{K}_0(B)$
into Grothendieck group of the abelian monoid formed by $\mathbb{K}$-points of ind ind-scheme
associated to $\mathfrak{KK}(\mathbb{K},B)$. A similar result about a relation between finite-dimensional
representations of an algebra $A$ and $\mathfrak{KK}(A,\mathbb{K})$ is proved.
