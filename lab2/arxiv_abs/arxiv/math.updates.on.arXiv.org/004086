This is a tutorial introduction to the functional analysis mathematics needed in many physical
problems, such as in waves in continuous media. Functional analysis takes us beyond finite matrices,
allowing us to work with infinite sets of continuous functions. It resolves important issues, such
as whether, why and how we can practically reduce such problems to finite matrix approximations.
It is, however, difficult to find a readable introduction that is efficient and comprehensible
for scientists and engineers. Here, I have selected only the topics necessary for the most important
results, but the argument is mathematically complete and self-contained. The article starts from
sets and sequences of real numbers. It then develops spaces of vectors or functions, introducing
the concepts of norms and metrics that allow us to consider how these can converge. Adding the inner
product, it introduces Hilbert spaces, and the key forms of operators that map within or between
such spaces. This leads to the concept of compact operators, which allows us to resolve many difficulties
of working with infinite sets of vectors or functions. We then introduce Hilbert-Schmidt operators,
which are compact operators encountered extensively in physical problems, such as those involving
waves. Finally, it introduces the eigenfunctions for major classes of operators, and their powerful
properties, and ends with singular-value decomposition of operators. This article is written
in a style that is complementary to that of standard mathematical treatments; by relegating longer
proofs to a separate section, I have attempted to retain a clear narrative flow and motivation in
developing the mathematical structure. Hopefully, the result is useful to a broader readership
who need to understand this mathematics, especially in physical science and engineering.
