In last passage percolation models, the energy of a path is maximized over all directed paths with
given endpoints in a random environment, and the maximizing paths are called geodesics. The geodesics
and their energy can be scaled so that transformed geodesics cross unit distance and have fluctuations
and scaled energy of unit order. Here we consider Poissonian last passage percolation, a model lying
in the KPZ universality class, and refer to scaled geodesics as polymers and their scaled energies
as weights. Polymers may be viewed as random functions of the vertical coordinate and, when they
are, we show that they have modulus of continuity whose order is at most $t^{2/3}\big(\log t^{-1}\big)^{1/3}$.
The power of one-third in the logarithm may be expected to be sharp and in a related problem we show
that it is: among polymers in the unit box whose endpoints have vertical separation $t$ (and a horizontal
separation of the same order), the maximum transversal fluctuation has order $t^{2/3}\big(\log
t^{-1}\big)^{1/3}$. Regarding the orthogonal direction, in which growth occurs, we show that,
when one endpoint of the polymer is fixed at $(0,0)$ and the other is varied vertically over $(0,z)$,
$z\in [1,2]$, the resulting random weight profile has sharp modulus of continuity of order $t^{1/3}\big(\log
t^{-1}\big)^{2/3}$. In this way, we identify exponent pairs of $(2/3,1/3)$ and $(1/3,2/3)$ in
power law and polylogarithmic correction, respectively for polymer fluctuation, and polymer
weight under vertical endpoint perturbation. The two exponent pairs describe [10,11,9] the fluctuation
of the boundary separating two phases in subcritical planar random cluster models.
