The COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defying global health crisis of our time. The absence
of mass testing and the relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals causes the available data
of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil to be largely under-reported regarding the number of infected
individuals and deaths. We propose an adapted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model which
explicitly incorporates the under-reporting and the response of the population to public policies
(such as confinement measures, widespread use of masks, etc) to cast short-term and long-term predictions.
Large amounts of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions. In this paper, we
discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction, which is illustrated regarding three key aspects.
First, assuming that the number of infected individuals is under-reported, we demonstrate an anticipation
regarding the peak of infection. Furthermore, while a model with a single class of infected individuals
yields forecasts with increased peaks, a model that considers both symptomatic and asymptomatic
infected individuals suggests a decrease of the peak of symptomatic. Second, considering that
the actual amount of deaths is larger than what is being register, then demonstrate the increase
of the mortality rates. Third, when consider generally under-reported data, we demonstrate how
the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change qualitatively and quantitatively.
We also investigate the effect of the "COVID-19 under-reporting tripod", i.e. the under-reporting
in terms of infected individuals, of deaths and the true mortality rate. If two of these factors are
known, the remainder can be inferred, as long as proportions are kept constant. The proposed approach
allows one to determine the margins of uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality
rates.
