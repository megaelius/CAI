We consider a class of kinetically constrained interacting particle systems on $Z^d$ which play
a key role in several heuristic qualitative and quantitative approaches to describe the complex
behavior of glassy dynamics. With rate one and independently among the vertices of $Z^d$, to each
occupation variable $\eta(x)$ a new value is proposed by tossing a (1-q)-coin. If a certain local
constraint is satisfied by the current configuration the proposed move is accepted, otherwise
it is rejected. For d=1 the constraint requires that there is a vacancy at the vertex to the left of
the updating vertex. In this case the process is the well known East process. In two dimensions the
West or the South neighbor of the updating vertex must contain a vacancy. Similarly in higher dimensions.
Despite of their apparent simplicity, in the limit of low vacancy density, corresponding to a low
temperature physical setting, these processes feature a rather complicated dynamic behavior
with hierarchical relaxation time scales, heterogeneity and universality. Using renormalization
group ideas, we first show that the relaxation time in d-dimensions scales as the 1/d-root of the
relaxation time of the East process, confirming indications coming from massive numerical simulations.
Next we compute the relaxation time in finite boxes by carefully analyzing the subtle energy-entropy
competition, using a multi-scale analysis, capacity methods and an algorithmic construction.
Our results establish dynamic heterogeneity and a dramatic dependence on the boundary conditions.
Finally we prove a rather strong anisotropy property of these processes: the creation of a new vacancy
at a vertex $x$ out of an isolated one at the origin (a seed) may occur on (logarithmically) different
time scales which heavily depend not only on the $\ell_1$-norm of $x$ but also on its direction.
