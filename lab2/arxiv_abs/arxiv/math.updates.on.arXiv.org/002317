The affine matrix rank minimization (AMRM) problem is to find a matrix of minimum rank that satisfies
a given linear system constraint. It has many applications in some important areas such as control,
recommender systems, matrix completion and network localization. However, the problem (AMRM)
is NP-hard in general due to the combinational nature of the matrix rank function. There are many
alternative functions have been proposed to substitute the matrix rank function, which lead to
many corresponding alternative minimization problems solved efficiently by some popular convex
or nonconvex optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new nonconvex function, namely,
$TL_{\alpha}^{\epsilon}$ function (with $0\leq\alpha<1$ and $\epsilon>0$), to approximate
the rank function, and translate the NP-hard problem (AMRM) into the $TL_{p}^{\epsilon}$ function
affine matrix rank minimization (TLAMRM) problem. Firstly, we study the equivalence of problem
(AMRM) and (TLAMRM), and proved that the uniqueness of global minimizer of the problem (TLAMRM)
also solves the NP-hard problem (AMRM) if the linear map $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies a restricted isometry
property (RIP). Secondly, an iterative thresholding algorithm is proposed to solve the regularization
problem (RTLAMRM) for all $0\leq\alpha<1$ and $\epsilon>0$. At last, some numerical results on
low-rank matrix completion problems illustrated that our algorithm is able to recover a low-rank
matrix, and the extensive numerical on image inpainting problems shown that our algorithm performs
the best in finding a low-rank image compared with some state-of-art methods.
