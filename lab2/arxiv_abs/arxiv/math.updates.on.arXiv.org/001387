The large-system performance of MAP estimation is studied considering a general distortion function
when the observation vector is received through a linear system with additive white Gaussian noise.
The analysis considers the system matrix to be chosen from the large class of rotationally invariant
random matrices. We take a statistical mechanical approach by introducing a spin glass corresponding
to the estimator, and employing the replica method for the large-system analysis. In contrast to
earlier replica based studies, our analysis evaluates the general replica ansatz of the corresponding
spin glass and determines the asymptotic distortion of the estimator for any structure of the replica
correlation matrix. Consequently, the replica symmetric as well as the Replica Symmetry (RS) breaking
ansatz with $b$ steps of breaking is deduced from the given general replica ansatz. The generality
of our distortion function lets us derive a more general form of the MAP decoupling principle. Based
on the general replica ansatz, we show that for any structure of the replica correlation matrix,
the vector-valued system decouples into a bank of equivalent decoupled linear systems followed
by MAP estimators. The structure of the decoupled linear system is further studied under both the
RS and the Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) assumptions. For $b$ steps of RSB, the decoupled system
is found to be an additive system with a noise term given as the sum of an independent Gaussian random
variable with $b$ correlated impairment terms. As an application of our study, we investigate large
compressive sensing systems by considering the $\ell_p$ minimization recovery schemes. Our numerical
investigations show that the replica symmetric ansatz for $\ell_0$ norm recovery fails to give
an accurate approximation of the mean square error as the compression rate grows, and therefore,
the RSB ans\"atze are needed.
