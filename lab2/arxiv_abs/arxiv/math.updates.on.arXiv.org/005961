We study global attractors $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}_f$ of semiflows generated by semilinear
partial parabolic differential equations of the form $u_t = u_{xx} + f(x,u,u_x), 0<x<1$, satisfying
Neumann boundary conditions. The equilibria $v\in\mathcal{E}\subset\mathcal{A}$ of the semiflow
are the stationary solutions of the PDE, hence they are solutions of the corresponding second order
ODE boundary value problem. Assuming hyperbolicity of all equilibria, the dynamic decomposition
of $\mathcal{A}$ into unstable manifolds of equilibria provides a geometric and topological characterization
of Sturm global attractors $\mathcal{A}$ as finite regular signed CW-complexes, the Sturm complexes,
with cells given by the unstable manifolds of equilibria. Concurrently, the permutation $\sigma=\sigma_f$
derived from the ODE boundary value problem by ordering the equilibria according to their values
at the boundaries $x=0,1$, respectively, completely determines the Sturm global attractor $\mathcal{A}$.
Equivalently, we use a planar curve, the meander $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_f$, associated to
the the ODE boundary value problem by shooting. The main objective of this paper is to derive a minimax
property which identifies the equilibria on the cell boundary of $\mathcal{O}$ which are closest
or most distant from $\mathcal{O}$ at the boundaries $x=0,1$, directly from the permutation $\sigma$,
the Sturm permutation, or equivalently from the meander $\mathcal{M}$, the Sturm meander, based
on the Sturm nodal properties of the solutions of the ODE boundary value problem. We emphasize the
local aspect of this result by applying it to an example for which the identification of the equilibria
in the cell boundary of $\mathcal{O}$ is obtained from the knowledge of only a section of the Sturm
meander $\mathcal{M}$.
