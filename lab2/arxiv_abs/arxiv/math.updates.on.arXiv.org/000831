With his Clifford algebra of differential forms, Kaehler's algebra addresses the overlooked manifestation
of symmetry in the solutions of exterior systems. In this algebra, solutions with a given symmetry
are members of left ideals generated by corresponding idempotents. These combine with phase factors
to take care of all the dependence of the solution on $x^{i}$ and $% dx^{i}$ for each $\partial /\partial
x^{i}=0$ symmetry. The maximum number of idempotents (each for a one-parameter group) that can,
therefore, go into a solution is the dimensionality $n$ of the space. This number is further limited
by non-commutativity of idempotents. We consider the tensor product of Kaehler algebra with tangent
Clifford algebra, i.e. of valuedness. It has a commutative subalgebra of "mirror elements", i.e.
where the valuedness is dual to the differential form (like in $dx\mathbf{i}$, but not in $dx\mathbf{j}$).
It removes the aforementioned limitation in the number of idempotent factors that can simultaneously
go into a solution. In the Kaehler calculus, which is based on the Kaehler algebra, total angular
momentum is linear in its components, even it is not valued in tangent algebra. In particular, it
is not a vector operator. We carry Kaehler's treatment over to the aforementioned commutative algebra.
Non-commutativity thus ceases to be a limiting factor in the formation of products of idempotents
representing each a one-parameter symmetry. The interplay of factors that emerges in the expanded
set of such products is inimical to operator theory. For practical reasons, we stop at products involving
three one-parameter idempotents ---henceforth call ternary--- even though the dimensionality
of the all important spacetime manifold allows for four of them.
