Reflected Brownian motion (RBM) in a convex polyhedral cone arises in a variety of applications
ranging from the theory of stochastic networks to math finance, and under general stability conditions,
it has a unique stationary distribution. In such applications, to implement a stochastic optimization
algorithm or quantify robustness of a model, it is useful to characterize the dependence of stationary
performance measures on model parameters. In this work we characterize parametric sensitivities
of the stationary distribution of an RBM in a simple convex polyhedral cone; that is, sensitivities
to perturbations of the parameters that define the RBM --- namely, the covariance matrix, drift
vector and directions of reflection along the boundary of the polyhedral cone. In order to characterize
these sensitivities we study the long time behavior of the joint process consisting of an RBM along
with its so-called derivative process, which characterizes pathwise derivatives of RBMs on finite
time intervals. We show that the joint process is positive recurrent, has a unique stationary distribution,
and parametric sensitivities of the stationary distribution of an RBM can be expressed in terms
of the stationary distribution of the joint process. This can be thought of as establishing an interchange
of the differential operator and the limit in time. The analysis of ergodicity of the joint process
is significantly more complicated than that of the RBM due to its degeneracy and the fact that the
derivative process exhibits jumps that are modulated by the RBM. The proofs of our results rely on
path properties of coupled RBMs and contraction properties related to the geometry of the polyhedral
cone and directions of reflection along the boundary. Our results are potentially useful for developing
efficient numerical algorithms for computing sensitivities of functionals of stationary RBMs.
