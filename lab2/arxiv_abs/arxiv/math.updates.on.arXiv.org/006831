We introduce AdaHessian, a second order stochastic optimization algorithm which dynamically
incorporates the curvature of the loss function via ADAptive estimates of the Hessian. Second order
algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties
as compared to first order methods such as SGD and ADAM. The main disadvantage of traditional second
order methods is their heavier per-iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first
order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in AdaHessian, including:
(i) a new variance reduction estimate of the Hessian diagonal with low computational overhead;
(ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal
across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian
diagonal elements. We show that AdaHessian achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin
as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of ADAM. In particular,
we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that AdaHessian:
(i) achieves 1.80\%/1.45\% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55\% higher accuracy
on ImageNet as compared to ADAM; (ii) outperforms ADAMW for transformers by 0.27/0.33 BLEU score
on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 1.8/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; and (iii) achieves 0.032\% better score
than AdaGrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset. Importantly, we show that the cost per iteration
of AdaHessian is comparable to first-order methods, and that it exhibits robustness towards its
hyperparameters. The code for AdaHessian is open-sourced and publicly available.
