Let $\mathfrak{C}$ be some Cantor space. We study groups of homeomorphisms of $\mathfrak{C}$ which
are vigorous, or, which are flawless, where we introduce both of these terms here. We say a group $G\leq
\operatorname{Homeo}(\mathfrak{C})$ is $vigorous$ if for any clopen set $A$ and proper clopen
subsets $B$ and $C$ of $A$ there is $\gamma \in G$ in the pointwise-stabiliser of $\mathfrak{C}\backslash
A$ with $B\gamma\subseteq C$. Being vigorous is similar in impact to some of the conditions proposed
by Epstein in his proof that certain groups of homeomorphisms of spaces have simple commutator subgroups
(and/or related conditions, as proposed in some of the work of Matui or of Ling). A non-trivial group
$G\leq \operatorname{Homeo}(\mathfrak{C})$ is $flawless$ if for all $k$ and $w$ a non-trivial
freely reduced product expression on $k$ variables (including inverse symbols), a particular
subgroup $w(G)_\circ$ of the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is the whole group. It is true, for instance,
that flawless groups are both perfect and lawless. We show: 1) simple vigorous groups are either
two-generated by torsion elements, or not finitely generated, 2) vigorous groups are simple if
and only if they are flawless, and, 3) the class of vigorous simple subgroups of $\operatorname{Homeo}(\mathfrak{C})$
is fairly broad (it contains many well known groups such as the commutator subgroups of the Higman-Thompson
groups $G_{n,r}$, the Brin-Thompson groups $nV$, R\"{o}ver's group $V(\Gamma)$, and others of
Nekrashevych's `simple groups of dynamical origin', and, the class is closed under various natural
constructions).
