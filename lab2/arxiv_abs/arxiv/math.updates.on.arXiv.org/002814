Let $Y=(Y(t))_{t\geq0}$ be a zero-mean Gaussian stationary process with covariance function
$\rho:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\rho(0)=1$. Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
be a square-integrable function with respect to the standard Gaussian measure, and suppose the
Hermite rank of $f$ is $d\geq 1$. If $\int_\mathbb{R} |\rho(s)|^dds<\infty$, then the celebrated
Breuer-Major theorem (in its continuous version) asserts that the finite-dimensional distributions
of $Z_\varepsilon:=\sqrt{\varepsilon}\int_0^{\cdot/\varepsilon}f(Y(s))ds$ converge to
those of $\sigma W$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$, where $W$ is a standard Brownian motion and $\sigma$ is
some explicit constant. Since its first appearance in 1983, this theorem has become a crucial probabilistic
tool in different areas, for instance in signal processing or in statistical inference for fractional
Gaussian processes. The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the tightness in
the Breuer-Major theorem. Surprisingly, this problem did not receive a lot of attention until now,
and the best available condition due to Ben Hariz [1] is neither arguably very natural, nor easy-to-check
in practice. In contrast, our condition very simple, as it only requires that $|f|^p$ must be integrable
with respect to the standard Gaussian measure for some $p$ strictly bigger than 2. It is obtained
by means of the Malliavin calculus, in particular Meyer inequalities. Secondly, and motivated
by a problem of geometrical nature, we extend the continuous Breuer-Major theorem to the notoriously
difficult case of self-similar Gaussian processes which are not necessarily stationary. An application
to the fluctuations associated with the length process of a regularized version of the bifractional
Browninan motion concludes the paper.
