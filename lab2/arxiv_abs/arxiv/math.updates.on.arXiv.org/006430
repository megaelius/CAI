We develop a linear theory of very weak solutions for nonlocal eigenvalue problems $\mathcal L u
= \lambda u + f$ involving integro-differential operators posed in bounded domains with homogeneous
Dirichlet exterior condition, with and without singular boundary data. We consider mild hypotheses
on the Green's function and the standard eigenbasis of the operator. The main examples in mind are
the fractional Laplacian operators. Without singular boundary datum and when $\lambda$ is not
an eigenvalue of the operator, we construct an $L^2$-projected theory of solutions, which we extend
to the optimal space of data for the operator $\mathcal L$. We present a Fredholm alternative as $\lambda$
tends to the eigenspace and characterise the possible blow-up limit. The main new ingredient is
the transfer of orthogonality to the test function. We then extend the results to singular boundary
data and study the so-called large solutions, which blow up at the boundary. For that problem we show
that, for any regular value $\lambda$, there exist "large eigenfunctions" that are singular on
the boundary and regular inside. We are also able to present a Fredholm alternative in this setting,
as $\lambda$ approaches the values of the spectrum. We also obtain a maximum principle for weighted
$L^1$ solutions when the operator is $L^2$-positive. It yields a global blow-up phenomenon as the
first eigenvalue is approached from below. Finally, we recover the classical Dirichlet problem
as the fractional exponent approaches one under mild assumptions on the Green's functions. Thus
"large eigenfunctions" represent a purely nonlocal phenomenon.
