Let $X$ be a complete, simply connected harmonic manifold with sectional curvatures $K$ satisfying
$K \leq -1$. In \cite{biswas6}, a Fourier transform was defined for functions on $X$, and a Fourier
inversion formula and Plancherel theorem were proved. We use the Fourier transform to investigate
the dynamics on $L^p(X)$ for $p > 2$ of certain bounded linear operators $T : L^p(X) \to L^p(X)$ which
we call "$L^p$-multipliers" in accordance with standard terminology. These operators are required
to preserve the subspace of $L^p$ radial functions. A notion of convolution with radial functions
was defined in \cite{biswas6}, and these operators are also required to be compatible with convolution
in the sense that $$ T\phi * \psi = \phi * T\psi $$ for all radial $C^{\infty}_c$-functions $\phi,
\psi$. They are also required to be compatible with translation of radial functions. Examples of
$L^p$-multipliers are given by the operator of convolution with an $L^1$ radial function, or more
generally convolution with a finite radial measure. In particular elements of the heat semigroup
$e^{t\Delta}$ act as multipliers. Given $2 < p < \infty$, we show that for any $L^p$-multiplier $T$
which is not a scalar multiple of the identity, there is an open set of values of $\nu \in \mathbb{C}$
for which the operator $\frac{1}{\nu} T$ is chaotic on $L^p(X)$ in the sense of Devaney, i.e. topologically
transitive and with periodic points dense. Moreover such operators are topologically mixing.
We also show that there is a constant $c_p > 0$ such that for any $c \in \mathbb{C}$ with $\Re c > c_p$,
the action of the shifted heat semigroup $e^{ct} e^{t\Delta}$ on $L^p(X)$ is chaotic. These results
generalize the corresponding results for rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type and negatively
curved harmonic $NA$ groups (or Damek-Ricci spaces).
