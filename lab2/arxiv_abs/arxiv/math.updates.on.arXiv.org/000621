This paper deals with different concepts for characterizing the size of mathematical objects.
A game theoretic investigation and generalization of two size concepts, which can both be formulated
in topological terms, is provided: the so called "Baire category" and the "$\sigma $-category".
This is mainly done by means of (generalized) Banach-Mazur games using the Axiom of determinacy
(the inconsistency of AC and AD are reflected in the beginning and a weaker form of AC is chosen for
proofs). Analogue versions of Cantor-Bendixson and Heine-Borel are proofed as well as some definability
results. Such size concepts are established f.i. in measure and integration theory, set theory
and topology often leading to mathematically precise formulations of "fuzziness". In measure
and integration theory f.i. one defines for a "measure space" $(\Omega, \underline{A}, \mu)$ -
i.e. $\Omega$ is a non empty set, $\underline{A}$ a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ and $\mu$ a measure
on $(\Omega,\underline{A})$ - and a property $E \subset \Omega$ of elements of $\Omega$, that the
property $E$ is valid in a set $A\in\underline{A}$ "$\mu$-almost everywhere", if $E$ is true in
$A$ up to a "$\mu$-null set" - i.e. $\exists N\in\underline{A}{ } (\mu(N)=0 \wedge A\cap N^\complement
\subset E)$. This is crucial for the formulation of uniqueness statements in measure and integration
theory as its theorems usually only apply up to "small" ($\mu$-null) sets. Key words: Axiom of choice
