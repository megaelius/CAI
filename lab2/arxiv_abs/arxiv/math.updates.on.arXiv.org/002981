Densifying networks and deploying more antennas at each access point are two principal ways to boost
the capacity of wireless networks. However, the complicated distributions of the signal power
and the accumulated interference power, largely induced by various space-time processing techniques,
make it highly challenging to quantitatively characterize the performance of multi-antenna networks.
In this paper, using tools from stochastic geometry, a unified framework is developed for the analysis
of such networks. The major results are two innovative representations of the coverage probability,
which make the analysis of multi-antenna networks almost as tractable as the single-antenna case.
One is expressed as an $\ell_1$-induced norm of a Toeplitz matrix, and the other is given in a finite
sum form. With a compact representation, the former incorporates many existing analytical results
on single- and multi-antenna networks as special cases, and leads to tractable expressions for
evaluating the coverage probability in both ad hoc and cellular networks. While the latter is more
complicated for numerical evaluation, it helps analytically gain key design insights. In particular,
it helps prove that the coverage probability of ad hoc networks is a monotonically decreasing convex
function of the transmitter density and that there exists a peak value of the coverage improvement
when increasing the number of transmit antennas. On the other hand, in multi-antenna cellular networks,
it is shown that the coverage probability is independent of the transmitter density and that the
outage probability decreases exponentially as the number of transmit antennas increases.
