This work introduces a novel discontinuity-tracking framework for resolving discontinuous solutions
of conservation laws with high-order numerical discretizations that support inter-element solution
discontinuities, such as discontinuous Galerkin methods. The proposed method aims to align inter-element
boundaries with discontinuities in the solution by deforming the computational mesh. A discontinuity-aligned
mesh ensures the discontinuity is represented through inter-element jumps while smooth basis
functions interior to elements are only used to approximate smooth regions of the solution, thereby
avoiding Gibbs' phenomena that create well-known stability issues. Therefore, very coarse high-order
discretizations accurately resolve the piecewise smooth solution throughout the domain, provided
the discontinuity is tracked. Central to the proposed discontinuity-tracking framework is a discrete
PDE-constrained optimization formulation that simultaneously aligns the computational mesh
with discontinuities in the solution and solves the discretized conservation law on this mesh.
The optimization objective is taken as a combination of the the deviation of the finite-dimensional
solution from its element-wise average and a mesh distortion metric to simultaneously penalize
Gibbs' phenomena and distorted meshes. We advocate a gradient-based, full space solver where the
mesh and conservation law solution converge to their optimal values simultaneously and therefore
never require the solution of the discrete conservation law on a non-aligned mesh. The merit of the
proposed method is demonstrated on a number of one- and two-dimensional model problems including
2D supersonic flow around a bluff body. We demonstrate optimal $\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$ convergence
rates in the $L^1$ norm for up to polynomial order $p=6$ and show that accurate solutions can be obtained
on extremely coarse meshes.
