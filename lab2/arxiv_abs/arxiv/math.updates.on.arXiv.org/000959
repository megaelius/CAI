Trees have long been used as a graphical representation of species relationships. However complex
evolutionary events, such as genetic reassortments or hybrid speciations which occur commonly
in viruses, bacteria and plants, do not fit into this elementary framework. Alternatively, various
network representations have been developed. Circular networks are a natural generalization
of leaf-labeled trees interpreted as split systems, that is, collections of bipartitions over
leaf labels corresponding to current species. Although such networks do not explicitly model specific
evolutionary events of interest, their straightforward visualization and fast reconstruction
have made them a popular exploratory tool to detect network-like evolution in genetic datasets.
Standard reconstruction methods for circular networks, such as Neighbor-Net, rely on an associated
metric on the species set. Such a metric is first estimated from DNA sequences, which leads to a key
difficulty: distantly related sequences produce statistically unreliable estimates. This is
problematic for Neighbor-Net as it is based on the popular tree reconstruction method Neighbor-Joining,
whose sensitivity to distance estimation errors is well established theoretically. In the tree
case, more robust reconstruction methods have been developed using the notion of a distorted metric,
which captures the dependence of the error in the distance through a radius of accuracy. Here we design
the first circular network reconstruction method based on distorted metrics. Our method is computationally
efficient. Moreover, the analysis of its radius of accuracy highlights the important role played
by the maximum incompatibility, a measure of the extent to which the network differs from a tree.
