A parallel pseudospectral code for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of isotropic turbulence
has been developed. The code has been extensively benchmarked using established results from literature.
The code has been used to conduct a series of runs for freely-decaying turbulence. We explore the
use of power-law decay of the total energy to determine an evolved time and compare with the use of
dynamic quantities such as the peak dissipation rate, maximum transport power and velocity derivative
skewness. Stationary turbulence has also been investigated, where we ensure that the energy input
rate remains constant for all runs. We present results for Reynolds numbers up to R{\lambda} = 335
on a 1024^3 lattice. An exploitation of the pseudospectral technique is used to calculate second
and third-order structure functions from the energy and transfer spectra, with a comparison presented
to the real-space calculation. An alternative to ESS is discussed, with the second-order exponent
found to approach 2/3. The dissipation anomaly is considered for forced and free-decay. The K\'arm\'an-Howarth
equation (KHE) is studied and a derivation of a new work term presented. The balance of energy represented
by the KHE is then investigated. Based on the KHE, we develop a model for the behaviour of the dimensionless
dissipation coefficient that predicts C{\epsilon} = C{\epsilon}(\infty) + C_L/R_L, with C{\epsilon}(\infty)
= 0.47 and C_L = 19.1 obtained from DNS data. Theoretical methods based on RG and statistical closures
are still being developed to study turbulence. The dynamic RG procedure used by Forster, Nelson
and Stephen (FNS) is considered in some detail and a disagreement in the literature is resolved here.
The application of statistical closure and renormalized perturbation theory is discussed and
a new two-time model probability density functional presented.
