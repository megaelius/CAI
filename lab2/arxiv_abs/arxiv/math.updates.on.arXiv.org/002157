We investigate the microcanonical version of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, by introducing
a fixed trace constraint for its second moment. Like for the canonical Ginibre ensemble, its complex
eigenvalues can be interpreted as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas, which are now subject to a constraint
and a modified, collective confining potential. Despite the lack of determinantal structure in
this fixed trace ensemble, we compute all its density correlation functions at finite matrix size
and compare to a fixed trace ensemble of normal matrices, representing a different Coulomb gas.
Our main tool of investigation is the Laplace transform, that maps back the fixed trace to the induced
Ginibre ensemble. Products of random matrices have been used to study the Lyapunov and stability
exponents for chaotic dynamical systems, where the latter are based on the complex eigenvalues
of the product matrix. Because little is known about the universality of the eigenvalue distribution
of such product matrices, we then study the product of $m$ induced Ginibre matrices with a fixed trace
constraint - which are clearly non-Gaussian - and $M-m$ such Ginibre matrices without constraint.
Using an $m$-fold inverse Laplace transform, we obtain a concise result for the spectral density
of such a mixed product matrix at finite matrix size, for arbitrary fixed $m$ and $M$. Very recently
local and global universality was proven by the authors and their coworker for a more general, single
elliptic fixed trace ensemble in the bulk of the spectrum. Here, we argue that the spectral density
of mixed products is in the same universality class as the product of $M$ independent induced Ginibre
ensembles.
