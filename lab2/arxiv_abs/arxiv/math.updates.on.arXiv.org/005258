In this paper, we consider several questions emerging from the Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem, which
characterizes the shift-invariant subspaces of vector-valued Hardy spaces. The Beurling-Lax-Halmos
Theorem states that a backward shift-invariant subspace is a model space $\mathcal{H}(\Delta)
\equiv H_E^2 \ominus \Delta H_{E}^2$, for some inner function $\Delta$. Our first question calls
for a description of the set $F$ in $H_E^2$ such that $\mathcal{H}(\Delta)=E_F^*$, where $E_F^*$
denotes the smallest backward shift-invariant subspace containing the set $F$. In our pursuit
of a general solution to this question, we are naturally led to take into account a canonical decomposition
of operator-valued strong $L^2$-functions. Next, we ask: Is every shift-invariant subspace the
kernel of a (possibly unbounded) Hankel operator? As we know, the kernel of a Hankel operator is shift-invariant,
so the above question is equivalent to seeking a solution to the equation $\ker H_{\Phi}^*=\Delta
H_{E^{\prime}}^2$, where $\Delta$ is an inner function satisfying $\Delta^* \Delta=I_{E^{\prime}}$
almost everywhere on the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$ and $H_{\Phi}$ denotes the Hankel operator with
symbol $\Phi$. Consideration of the above question on the structure of shift-invariant subspaces
leads us to study and coin a new notion of "Beurling degree" for an inner function. We then establish
a deep connection between the spectral multiplicity of the model operator and the Beurling degree
of the corresponding characteristic function. At the same time, we consider the notion of meromorphic
pseudo-continuations of bounded type for operator-valued functions, and then use this notion
to study the spectral multiplicity of model operators (truncated backward shifts) between separable
complex Hilbert spaces. In particular, we consider the multiplicity-free case.
