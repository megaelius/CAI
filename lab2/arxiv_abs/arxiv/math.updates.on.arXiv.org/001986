The shallow water equations (SWE) are a widely used model for the propagation of surface waves on
the oceans. In particular, the SWE are used to model the propagation of tsunami waves in the open ocean.
We consider the associated data assimilation problem of optimally determining the initial conditions
for the one-dimensional SWE in an unbounded domain from a small set of observations of the sea surface
height and focus on how the structure of the observation operator affects the convergence of the
gradient approach employed to solve the data assimilation problem computationally. In the linear
case we prove a theorem that gives sufficient conditions for convergence to the true initial conditions.
It asserts that at least two observation points must be used and at least one pair of observation points
must be spaced more closely than half the effective minimum wavelength of the energy spectrum of
the initial conditions. Our analysis is confirmed by numerical experiments for both the linear
and nonlinear SWE data assimilation problems which reveal a relation between the convergence rate
of gradient iterations and the number and spacing of the observation points. More specifically,
these results show that convergence rates improve with increasing numbers of observation points
and that at least three observation points are required for the practically useful results. Better
results are obtained for the nonlinear equations provided more than two observation points are
used. This paper is a first step in understanding the conditions for observability of the SWE for
small numbers of observation points in more physically realistic settings.
