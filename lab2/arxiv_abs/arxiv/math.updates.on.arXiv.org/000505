We propose a definition of differential graded Poisson algebra, which can be regarded as a "combination"
of differential graded algebras and graded Poisson algebras. After giving some basic properties
of differential graded Poisson algebras and modules, we concentrate on the study of universal enveloping
algebras of differential graded Poisson algebras. For any differential graded Poisson algebra
$A$, we prove that $A$ has a unique universal enveloping algebra $A^e$ up to isomorphisms which is
a differential graded algebra, and that $e$ is a covariant functor from the category of differential
graded Poisson algebras to the category of differential graded algebras, and $\mathbf{ DGP}(A)\cong\mathbf{
DG}(A^e)$, where $\mathbf{ DGP}(A)$ denotes the category of differential graded Poisson modules
over $A$ and $\mathbf{DG}(A^e)$ denotes the category of differential graded modules over $A^e$.
As applications, we prove that $(A^e)^{op}\cong (A^{op})^e$ and $(A\otimes_{\Bbbk}B)^e\cong
A^e\otimes_{\Bbbk}B^e$ as differential graded algebras, which are helpful to study the "Hochschild
(co)homology theory" in the category of differential graded Poisson bimodules, where $B$ is another
differential graded Poisson algebra. As consequences, we have $(\mathbb{S}L)^e\cong \mathbf{U}(L\rtimes
L)$ and $(A^{\mathcal{E}})^e\cong (A^e)^{\mathcal{E}}$, where $L$ is a differential graded
Lie algebra, $\mathbb{S}L$ is the graded symmetric algebra of $L$, $\mathbf{U}(L\rtimes L)$ is
the universal enveloping algebra of the differential graded Lie algebra $L\rtimes L$ and $A^{\mathcal{E}}:=A\otimes
A^{op}$, the classic universal enveloping algebra of $A$.
