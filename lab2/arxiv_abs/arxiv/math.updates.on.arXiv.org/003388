The approaches, based on the negative binomial model for the distribution of duration of the wet
periods measured in days, are proposed to the definition of extreme precipitation. This model demonstrates
excellent fit with real data and provides a theoretical base for the determination of asymptotic
approximations to the distributions of the maximum daily precipitation volume within a wet period
as well as the total precipitation volume over a wet period. The first approach to the definition
(and determination) of extreme precipitation is based on the tempered Snedecor-Fisher distribution
of the maximum daily precipitation. According to this approach, a daily precipitation volume is
considered to be extreme, if it exceeds a certain (pre-defined) quantile of the tempered Snedecor--Fisher
distribution. The second approach is based on that the total precipitation volume for a wet period
has the gamma distribution. Hence, the hypothesis that the total precipitation volume during a
certain wet period is extremely large can be formulated as the homogeneity hypothesis of a sample
from the gamma distribution. Two equivalent tests are proposed for testing this hypothesis. Both
of these tests deal with the relative contribution of the total precipitation volume for a wet period
to the considered set (sample) of successive wet periods. Within the second approach it is possible
to introduce the notions of relatively and absolutely extreme precipitation volumes. The results
of the application of these tests to real data are presented yielding the conclusion that the intensity
of wet periods with extreme large precipitation volume increases.
