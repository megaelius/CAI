We consider resource allocation (RA) in multi-carrier coordinated multi-point (CoMP) systems
with limited feedback, in which a cluster of base stations (BSs), each equipped with multiple antennas,
are connect to each other and/or a central processor via backhauls/fronthauls. The main objective
of coordinated RA is to select user equipments (UEs) on each subcarrier, dynamically decide upon
the cluster size for each subcarrier, and finally partition the feedback resources, provisioned
for acquisition of channel direction information (CDI) across all subcarriers, active cells,
and selected UEs, in order to maximize the weighted sum utility (WSU). We show how to recast the WSU
maximization problem to achieve spectral efficiency, quality-of-service (QoS), and energyefficiency
(EE). Specifically, we investigate four instances of WSU to maximize practical system objectives:
(i) weighted sum capacity, (ii) weighted sum effective capacity, (iii) weighted sum energy-efficiency
(EE), and (iv) weighted sum effective EE. The unified composition of these problems through WSU
allows us to use the same set of developed algorithms for all cases. The algorithms have a greedy structure
achieving fast convergence, and successfully cope with the huge computational complexity of RA
problems, mostly rooted in their combinatorial compositions. Our simulation results shed lights
on the network optimization by discovering insights on appropriate cluster-size, distribution
of BSs in the cluster, and the number of subcarriers. The proposed UE scheduling and subcarrier assignment
are shown to improve the system performance by several orders-of-magnitude.
