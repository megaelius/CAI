The two major effects observed in collisions of the continuum $\phi^4$ kinks are (i) the existence
of critical collision velocity above which the kinks always emerge from the collision and (ii) the
existence of the escape windows for multi-bounce collisions with the velocity below the critical
one, associated with the energy exchange between the kink's internal and translational modes.
The potential merger (for sufficiently low collision speeds) of the kink and antikink produces
a bion with oscillation frequency $\omega_B$, which constantly radiates energy, since its higher
harmonics are always within the phonon spectrum. Similar effects have been observed in the discrete
$\phi^4$ kink-antikink collisions for relatively weak discreteness. Here we analyze kinks colliding
with their mirror image antikinks in the regime of strong discreteness considering an exceptional
discretization of the $\phi^4$ field equation where the static Peierls-Nabarro potential is precisely
zero and the not-too-fast kinks can propagate practically radiating no energy. Several new effects
are observed in this case, originating from the fact that the phonon band width is small for strongly
discrete lattices and for even higher discreteness an inversion of the phonon spectrum takes place
with the short waves becoming low-frequency waves. When the phonon band is narrow, not a bion but
a discrete breather with frequency $\omega_{DB}$ and all higher harmonics outside the phonon band
is formed. When the phonon spectrum is inverted, the kink and antikink become mutually repulsive
solitary waves with oscillatory tails, and their collision is possible only for velocities above
a threshold value sufficient to overcome their repulsion.
