The purpose of this paper is to study non-trivial $p$-polygonal equalities in $L_{p}$-spaces,
$0 < p < \infty$. Our main results provide a complete classification of all non-trivial $p$-polygonal
equalities in $L_{p}(\Omega, \mu)$, $0 < p \leq 2$. This in turn provides a classification of
the subsets of $L_{p}(\Omega, \mu)$ that have strict $p$-negative type, $0 < p \leq 2$. One reason
for studying $p$-polygonal equalities in $L_{p}$-spaces is that they preclude the existence of
certain types of isometry. For example, our techniques show that if $0 < p < \infty$ and if $(X,d)$
is a metric space that has strict $q$-negative type for some $q \geq p$, then: (1) $(X,d)$ is not isometric
to any linear subspace $W$ of $L_{p}(\Omega, \mu)$ that contains a pair of disjointly supported
non-zero vectors, and (2) $(X,d)$ is not isometric to any subset of $L_{p}(\Omega, \mu)$ that has
non-empty interior. Additionally, in the case $p = 2$, it follows that $(X,d)$ is not isometric to
any affinely dependent subset of $L_{2}(\Omega, \mu)$. These non-embedding theorems are special
instances of a more general principle: If $(Y, \rho)$ is a metric space whose supremal $p$-negative
type $\wp$ is finite and if $(X,d)$ is a metric space that has strict $q$-negative type for some $q
\geq \wp$, then $(X,d)$ is not isometric to any metric subspace of $(Y, \rho)$ that admits a non-trivial
$p_{1}$-polygonal equality for some $p_{1} \in [\wp, q]$. It is notable in all of these statements
that the metric space $(X,d)$ can, for instance, be any ultrametric space. As a result we obtain new
insights into sophisticated embedding theorems of Lemin, and Shkarin.
