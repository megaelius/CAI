This paper deals with a boundary-value problem for a coupled chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system
involving tensor-valued sensitivity with saturation $$\left\{ \begin{array}{l} n_t+u\cdot\nabla
n=\Delta n-\nabla\cdot(nS(x,n,c)\nabla c),\quad x\in \Omega, t>0, c_t+u\cdot\nabla c=\Delta
c-c+n,\quad x\in \Omega, t>0,\\ u_t+\kappa(u \cdot \nabla)u+\nabla P=\Delta u+n\nabla \phi,\quad
x\in \Omega, t>0,\\ \nabla\cdot u=0,\quad x\in \Omega, t>0, \end{array}\right.$$ which describes
chemotaxis-fluid interaction in cases when the evolution of the chemoattractant is essentially
dominated by production through cells, where $\kappa\in \mathbb{R},\phi\in W^{2,\infty}(\Omega)$
and $S$ is a given function with values in $\mathbb{R}^{2\times2}$ which fulfills $$|S(x,n,c)|
\leq C_S (1 + n)^{-\alpha}$$ with some $C _S > 0$ and $\alpha \geq 0.$ If $\alpha>0$ and $\Omega\subseteq
\mathbb{R}^2$ is a {\bf bounded} domain with smooth boundary, then for all reasonably regular initial
data, a corresponding initial-boundary value problem for $(KSNF)$ possesses a global classical
solution which is bounded on $\Omega\times(0,\infty)$. This extends a recent result by Wang-Winkler-Xiang
(Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa-Classe di Scienze. XVIII, (2018), 2036--2145)
which asserts global existence of bounded solutions under the constraint $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$
is a bounded {\bf convex domain} with smooth boundary. Moreover, we shall improve the result of Wang-Xiang
(J. Diff. Eqns., 259(2015), 7578--7609), who proved the possibility of global and bounded, in the
case that ${\bf\kappa\equiv0}$ and $\alpha>0$. In comparison to the result for the corresponding
fluid-free system, the {\bf optimal condition} on the parameter $\alpha$ for both {\bf global existence}
and {\bf boundedness} are obtained.
