The methodology proposed in this paper bridges the gap between entropy stable and positivity-preserving
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for nonlinear hyperbolic problems. The entropy stability
property and, optionally, preservation of local bounds for the cell averages are enforced using
flux limiters based on entropy conditions and discrete maximum principles, respectively. Entropy
production by the (limited) gradients of the piecewise-linear DG approximation is constrained
using Rusanov-type entropy viscosity, as proposed by Abgrall in the context of nodal finite element
approximations. We cast his algebraic entropy fix into a form suitable for arbitrary polynomial
bases and, in particular, for modal DG approaches. The Taylor basis representation of the entropy
stabilization term reveals that it penalizes the solution gradients in a manner similar to slope
limiting and requires semi-implicit treatment to achieve the desired effect. The implicit Taylor
basis version of the Rusanov entropy fix preserves the sparsity pattern of the element mass matrix.
Hence, no linear systems need to be solved if the Taylor basis is orthogonal and an explicit treatment
of the remaining terms is adopted. The optional application of a vertex-based slope limiter constrains
the piecewise-linear DG solution to be bounded by local maxima and minima of the cell averages. The
combination of entropy stabilization with flux and slope limiting leads to constrained approximations
that possess all desired properties. Numerical studies of the new limiting techniques and entropy
correction procedures are performed for two scalar two-dimensional test problems with nonlinear
and nonconvex flux functions.
