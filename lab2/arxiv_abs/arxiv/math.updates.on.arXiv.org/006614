In this paper, the fuzzy multi-objective reliability redundancy allocation problem (FMORRAP)
is proposed, which maximizes the system reliability while simultaneously minimizing the system
cost under the type 2 fuzzy uncertainty. In the proposed formulation, the higher order uncertainties
(such as parametric, manufacturing, environmental, and designers uncertainty) associated with
the system are modeled with interval type 2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FS). The footprint of uncertainty of the
interval type 2 membership functions (IT2 MFs) accommodates these uncertainties by capturing
the multiple opinions from several system experts. We consider IT2 MFs to represent the subsystem
reliability and cost, which are to be further aggregated using extension principle to evaluate
the total system reliability and cost according to their configurations, i.e., series parallel
and parallel series. We proposed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based novel solution approach
to solve the FMORRAP. To demonstrate the applicability of two formulations, namely, series parallel
FMORRAP and parallel series FMORRAP, we performed experimental simulations on various numerical
data sets. The decision makers/system experts assign different importance to the objectives (system
reliability and cost), and these preferences are represented by sets of weights. The optimal results
are obtained from our solution approach, and the Pareto optimal front is established using these
different weight sets. The genetic algorithm (GA) was implemented to compare the results obtained
from our proposed solution approach. A statistical analysis was conducted between PSO and GA, and
it was found that the PSO based Pareto solution outperforms the GA.
