The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method of "stabilizing" spaces of homomorphisms $Hom(\pi,G)$
where $\pi$ is a certain choice of finitely generated group and $G$ is a compact Lie group. The main
results apply to the space of all ordered $n$-tuples of pairwise commuting elements in a compact
Lie group $G$, denoted $Hom(\mathbb{Z}^n,G)$, by assembling these spaces into a single space for
all $n \geq 0$. The resulting space denoted $Comm(G)$ is an infinite dimensional analogue of a Stiefel
manifold which can be regarded as the space, suitably topologized, of all finite ordered sets of
generators for all finitely generated abelian subgroups of $G$. The methods are to develop the geometry
and topology of the free associative monoid generated by a maximal torus of $G$, and to "twist" this
free monoid into a space which approximates the space of "all commuting $n$-tuples" for all $n$,
$Comm(G)$, into a single space. Thus a new space $Comm(G)$ is introduced which assembles the spaces
$Hom(\mathbb{Z}^n,G)$ into a single space for all positive integers $n$. Topological properties
of $Comm(G)$ are developed while the singular homology of this space is computed with coefficients
in the ring of integers with the order of the Weyl group of $G$ inverted. One application is that the
cohomology of $Hom(\mathbb{Z}^n,G)$ follows from that of $Comm(G)$ for any cohomology theory.
The results for singular homology of $Comm(G)$ are given in terms of the tensor algebra generated
by the reduced homology of a maximal torus. Applications to classical Lie groups as well as exceptional
Lie groups are given. A stable decomposition of $Comm(G)$ is also given here with a significantly
finer stable decomposition to be given in the sequel to this paper along with extensions of these
constructions to additional representation varieties. The appendix gives the Hilbert-Poincare
series of $Comm(G)$.
