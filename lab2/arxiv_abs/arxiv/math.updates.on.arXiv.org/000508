A domain $S\subset{\mathbb{R}}^d$ is said to fulfill the Poincar\'{e} cone property if any point
in the boundary of $S$ is the vertex of a (finite) cone which does not otherwise intersects the closure
$\bar{S}$. For more than a century, this condition has played a relevant role in the theory of partial
differential equations, as a shape assumption aimed to ensure the existence of a solution for the
classical Dirichlet problem on $S$. In a completely different setting, this paper is devoted to
analyze some statistical applications of the Poincar\'{e} cone property (when defined in a slightly
stronger version). First, we show that this condition can be seen as a sort of generalized convexity:
while it is considerably less restrictive than convexity, it still retains some ``convex flavour.''
In particular, when imposed to a probability support $S$, this property allows the estimation of
$S$ from a random sample of points, using the ``hull principle'' much in the same way as a convex support
is estimated using the convex hull of the sample points. The statistical properties of such hull
estimator (consistency, convergence rates, boundary estimation) are considered in detail. Second,
it is shown that the class of sets fulfilling the Poincar\'{e} property is a $P$-Glivenko-Cantelli
class for any absolutely continuous distribution $P$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. This has some independent
interest in the theory of empirical processes, since it extends the classical analogous result,
established for convex sets, to a much larger class. Third, an algorithm to approximate the cone-convex
hull of a finite sample of points is proposed and some practical illustrations are given.
