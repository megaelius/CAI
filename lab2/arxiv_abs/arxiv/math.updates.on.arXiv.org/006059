Two legitimate parties, referred to as Alice and Bob, wish to generate secret keys from the wireless
channel in the presence of an eavesdropper, referred to as Eve, in order to use such keys for encryption
and decryption. In general, the secret key rate highly depends on the coherence time of the channel.
In particular, a straightforward method of generating secret keys in static environments results
in ultra-low rates. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a low-complexity method called
induced randomness. In this method, Alice and Bob independently generate local randomness to be
used together with the uniqueness of the wireless channel coefficients in order to enable high-rate
secret key generation. In this work, two scenarios are considered: first, when Alice and Bob share
a direct communication channel, and second, when Alice and Bob do not have a direct link and communicate
through an untrusted relay. After exchanging the induced randomness, post-processing is done
by Alice and Bob to generate highly-correlated samples that are used for the key generation. Such
samples are then converted into bits, disparities between the sequences generated by Alice and
Bob are mitigated, and the resulting sequences are then hashed to compensate for the information
leakage to the eavesdropper and to allow consistency checking of the generated key bit sequences.
We utilize semantic security measures and information-theoretic inequalities to upper bound
the probability of successful eavesdropping attack in terms of the mutual information measures
that can be numerically computed. Given certain reasonable system parameters this bound is numerically
evaluated to be $2^{-31}$ and $2^{-10.57}$ in the first and the second scenario, respectively.
