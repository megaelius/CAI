We introduce the Tucker tensor method for the grid-based assembled summation of long-range interaction
potentials over large 3D lattices in a box. This method is a generalization of our previous approach
on the low-rank canonical tensor summation of electrostatic potentials on a rectangular 3D lattice.
In the new technique we first approximate (with a guaranteed precision) the single kernel function
represented on large $N\times N \times N$ 3D grid in a bounding box by a low-rank reference Tucker
tensor. Then each 3D singular kernel function involved in the summation is approximated on the same
grid by the shift of the reference Tucker tensor. Directional vectors of the Tucker tensor representing
a full lattice sum are assembled by the 1D summation of the corresponding Tucker vectors for shifted
potentials, while the core tensor remains unchanged. The Tucker ranks of the resultant tensor sum
on the 3D rectangular $L\times L \times L$ lattice are proven to be the same as for the single kernel
function. The required storage scales linearly in the 1D grid-size, $O(N)$, while the numerical
cost is estimated by $O(N L)$. With the slight modifications our approach applies in the presence
of defects, such as vacancies, impurities and non-rectangular geometries of a set of active lattice
points, as well as for the case of hexagonal lattices. We prove the error bounds and stability for
the HOSVD Tucker approximation to a sum of canonical/Tucker tensors. Numerical tests confirm the
efficiency of the presented tensor summation method. In particular, we show that a sum of millions
of Newton kernels on a 3D lattice with defects/impurities can be computed in about a minute in Matlab
implementation. The approach is beneficial for functional calculus with the lattice potential
sum represented on large 3D grids in the Tucker/canonical formats.
