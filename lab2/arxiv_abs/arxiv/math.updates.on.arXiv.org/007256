Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. For a reduced word $\bf i$ of the longest
element in the Weyl group of $G$ and a dominant integral weight $\lambda$, one can construct the string
polytope $\Delta_{\bf i}(\lambda)$, whose lattice points encode the character of the irreducible
representation $V_{\lambda}$. The string polytope $\Delta_{\bf i}(\lambda)$ is singular in
general and combinatorics of string polytopes heavily depends on the choice of $\mathbf i$. In this
paper, we study combinatorics of string polytopes when $G = SL_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$, and present
a sufficient condition on $\mathbf i$ such that the toric variety $X_{\Delta_{\mathbf i}(\lambda)}$
of the string polytope $\Delta_{\mathbf i}(\lambda)$ has a small toric resolution. Indeed, when
$\mathbf i$ has small indices and $\lambda$ is regular, we explicitly construct a small toric resolution
of the toric variety $X_{\Delta_{\bf i}(\lambda)}$ using a Bott manifold. Our main theorem implies
that a toric variety of any string polytope admits a small toric resolution when $n < 4$. As a byproduct,
we show that if $\mathbf i$ has small indices then $\Delta_{\mathbf i}(\lambda)$ is integral for
any dominant integral weight $\lambda$, which in particular implies that the anticanonical limit
toric variety $X_{\Delta_{\bf i}(\lambda_P)}$ of a partial flag variety $G/P$ is Gorenstein Fano.
Furthermore, we apply our result to symplectic topology of the full flag manifold $G/B$ and obtain
a formula of the disk potential of the Lagrangian torus fibration on $G/B$ obtained from a flat toric
degeneration of $G/B$ to the toric variety $X_{\Delta_{\bf i}(\lambda)}$.
