The use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for transmit precoding provides
crucial energy efficiency advantage for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implementation.
This paper formulates a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation range and one-bit
symbol-level precoding design problem for minimizing the average symbol error rate (SER) in downlink
massive MIMO transmission. A tight upper-bound for SER with low-resolution DAC precoding is first
derived. The derived expression suggests that the performance degradation of one-bit precoding
can be interpreted as a decrease in the effective minimum distance of the QAM constellation. Using
the obtained SER expression, we propose a QAM constellation range design for the single-user case.
It is shown that in the massive MIMO limit, a reasonable choice for constellation range with one-bit
precoding is that of the infinite-resolution precoding with per-symbol power constraint, but
reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ or about $0.8$. The corresponding minimum distance reduction
translates to about 2dB gap between the performance of one-bit precoding and infinite-resolution
precoding. This paper further proposes a low-complexity heuristic algorithm for one-bit precoder
design. Finally, the proposed QAM constellation range and precoder design are generalized to the
multi-user downlink. We propose to scale the constellation range for infinite-resolution zero-forcing
(ZF) precoding with per-symbol power constraint by the same factor of $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ for one-bit
precoding. The proposed one-bit precoding scheme is shown to be within 2dB of infinite-resolution
ZF. In term of number of antennas, one-bit precoding requires about 50% more antennas to achieve
the same performance as infinite-resolution precoding.
