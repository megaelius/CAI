This work is on the Cauchy problem for critical wave maps coupled to Einstein's equations of general
relativity. The main result of this work is the proof that the energy of the Einstein-equivariant
wave map system does not concentrate during the Cauchy evolution. A key ingredient in the proof is
the use of the fact that geometric mass at infinity of the Einstein-equivariant wave map system is
conserved during the evolution. However, this observation has some subtle local implications
which have been used to estimate the energy locally. For instance, we construct a divergence-free
vector field which gives monotonicity of energy in the past null cone of any point. In addition, this
vector has also been used to prove that the energy does not concentrate away from the axis of the domain
manifold. Later, estimating the divergence of a Morawetz vector on a truncated past null cone, we
prove that the kinetic energy does not concentrate. Finally, assuming that the target manifold
satisfies the Grillakis condition, we proceed to prove the non-concentration of energy for the
critical Einstein-equivariant wave map system. Keeping track of various quantities of wave map
relative to the evolving null geometry of the background manifold is a recurring theme throughout
the course of this work. Apart from a purely mathematical interest, the motivation to study critical
self-gravitating wave maps is that they occur naturally in 3+1 Einstein's equations of general
relativity. Therefore, studying critical self-gravitating wave maps could be a fruitful way of
understanding the ever elusive global behaviour of Einstein's equations. This work is a step in
this endeavour.
