J. Zapletal asked if all the forcing notions considered in his monograph are homogeneous. Specifically,
he asked if the forcing consisting of Borel sets of $\sigma$-finite 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (ordered under inclusion) is homogeneous. We give a partial negative answer
to both questions by showing that this $\sigma$-ideal is not homogeneous. Let $\mathcal{N}^1_2$
be the $\sigma$-ideal of sets in the plane of 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure zero. D. H. Fremlin
determined the position of the cardinal invariants of this $\sigma$-ideal in the Cicho\'n Diagram.
This required proving numerous inequalities, and in all but three cases it was known that the inequalities
can be strict in certain models. For one of the remaining ones Fremlin posed this as an open question
in his monograph. We answer this by showing that consistently $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N}^1_2)
> \mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})$, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the usual Lebesgue null ideal. We also prove
that the remaining two inequalities can be strict. Moreover, we fit the cardinal invariants of the
$\sigma$-ideal of sets of $\sigma$-finite Hausdorff measure into the diagram. P. Humke and M. Laczkovich
raised the following question. Is it consistent that there is an ordering of the reals in which all
proper initial segments are Lebesgue null but for every ordering of the reals there is a proper initial
segment that is not null with respect to the $1/2$-dimensional Hausdorff measure? We determine
the values of the cardinal invariants of the Cicho\'n Diagram as well as the invariants of the nullsets
of Hausdorff measures in the first model mentioned in the previous paragraph, and as an application
we answer this question of Humke and Laczkovich affirmatively.
