We introduce the notion of $\varepsilon\eta\,$-Einstein $\varepsilon\,$-contact metric three-manifold,
which includes as particular cases $\eta\,$-Einstein Riemannian and Lorentzian (para) contact
metric three-manifolds, but which in addition allows for the Reeb vector field to be null. We prove
that the product of an $\varepsilon\eta\,$-Einstein Lorentzian $\varepsilon\,$-contact metric
three-manifold with an $\varepsilon\eta\,$-Einstein Riemannian contact metric three-manifold
carries a bi-parametric family of Ricci-flat Lorentzian metric-compatible connections with
isotropic, totally skew-symmetric, closed and co-closed torsion, which in turn yields a bi-parametric
family of solutions of six-dimensional minimal supergravity coupled to a tensor multiplet. This
result allows for the systematic construction of families of Lorentzian solutions of six-dimensional
supergravity from pairs of $\varepsilon\eta\,$-Einstein contact metric three-manifolds. We
classify all left-invariant $\varepsilon\eta\,$-Einstein structures on simply connected Lie
groups, paying special attention to the case in which the Reeb vector field is null. In particular,
we show that the Sasaki and K-contact notions extend to $\varepsilon\,$-contact structures with
null Reeb vector field but are however not equivalent conditions, in contrast to the situation occurring
when the Reeb vector field is not light-like. Furthermore, we pose the Cauchy initial-value problem
of an $\varepsilon\,$-contact $\varepsilon\eta\,$-Einstein structure, briefly studying the
associated constraint equations in a particularly simple decoupling limit. Altogether, we use
these results to obtain novel families of six-dimensional supergravity solutions, some of which
can be interpreted as continuous deformations of the maximally supersymmetric solution on $\widetilde{\mathrm{Sl}}(2,\mathbb{R})\times
S^3$.
