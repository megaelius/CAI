Let $(M,g)$ be a connected, closed, orientable Riemannian surface and denote by $\lambda_k(M,g)$
the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(M,g)$. In this paper, we consider the
mapping $(M, g)\mapsto \lambda_k(M,g)$. We propose a computational method for finding the conformal
spectrum $\Lambda^c_k(M,[g_0])$, which is defined by the eigenvalue optimization problem of
maximizing $\lambda_k(M,g)$ for $k$ fixed as $g$ varies within a conformal class $[g_0]$ of fixed
volume $\text{vol}(M,g) = 1$. We also propose a method for the problem where $M$ is additionally
allowed to vary over surfaces with fixed genus, $\gamma$. This is known as the topological spectrum
for genus $\gamma$ and denoted $\Lambda^t_k(\gamma)$. Our computations support a conjecture
of N. Nadirashvili (2002) that $\Lambda^t_k(0) = 8 \pi k$, attained by a sequence of surfaces degenerating
to a union of $k$ identical round spheres. Furthermore, based on our computations, we conjecture
that $\Lambda^t_k(1) = \frac{8\pi^2}{\sqrt{3}} + 8\pi (k-1)$, attained by a sequence of surfaces
degenerating into a union of an equilateral flat torus and $k-1$ identical round spheres. The values
are compared to several surfaces where the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues are well-known, including
spheres, flat tori, and embedded tori. In particular, we show that the flat torus of volume one with
the largest $k$-th Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue attains $\lambda_k = 4\pi^2 \left\lceil \frac{k}{2}
\right\rceil^2 \left( \left\lceil \frac{k}{2} \right\rceil^2 - \frac{1}{4}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$.
Several properties are also studied computationally, including uniqueness, symmetry, and eigenvalue
multiplicity.
