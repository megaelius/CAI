Cembranos and Freniche proved that for every two infinite compact Hausdorff spaces $X$ and $Y$ the
Banach space $C(X\times Y)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $X\times Y$ endowed with the
supremum norm contains a complemented copy of the Banach space $c_{0}$. We extend this theorem to
the class of $C_p$-spaces, that is, we prove that for all infinite Tychonoff spaces $X$ and $Y$ the
space $C_{p}(X\times Y)$ of continuous functions on $X\times Y$ endowed with the pointwise topology
contains either a complemented copy of $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ or a complemented copy of the space
$(c_{0})_{p}=\{(x_n)_{n\in\omega}\in \mathbb{R}^\omega\colon x_n\to 0\}$, both endowed
with the product topology. We show that the latter case holds always when $X\times Y$ is pseudocompact.
On the other hand, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis (or even a weaker set-theoretic assumption),
we provide an example of a pseudocompact space $X$ such that $C_{p}(X\times X)$ does not contain
a complemented copy of $(c_{0})_{p}$. As a corollary we show that for all infinite Tychonoff spaces
$X$ and $Y$ the space $C_{p}(X\times Y)$ is linearly homeomorphic to the space $C_{p}(X\times Y)\times\mathbb{R}$,
although, as proved earlier by Marciszewski, there exists an infinite compact space $X$ such that
$C_{p}(X)$ cannot be mapped onto $C_{p}(X)\times\mathbb{R}$ by a continuous linear surjection.
This provides a positive answer to one problem of Arkhangel'ski. Our another corollary---analogous
to the classical Rosenthal--Lacey theorem for Banach spaces $C(X)$ with $X$ compact and Hausdorff---asserts
that for every infinite Tychonoff spaces $X$ and $Y$ the space $C_{k}(X\times Y)$ of continuous
functions on $X\times Y$ endowed with the compact-open topology admits a quotient map onto a space
isomorphic to one of the following three spaces: $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, $(c_{0})_{p}$ or $c_{0}$.
