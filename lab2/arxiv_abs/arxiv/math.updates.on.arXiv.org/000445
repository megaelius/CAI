One of the greatest challenges in quantum information processing is the coherent control over quantum
systems with an ever increasing number of particles. Within this endeavor, the harnessing of many-body
entanglement against the effects of the environment is a pressing issue. Besides being an important
concept from a fundamental standpoint, entanglement is recognized as a crucial resource for performance
enhancements over classical methods. Understanding and controlling many-body entanglement
in open systems may have implications in quantum computing, quantum simulations, secure quantum
communication, quantum metrology, our understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition,
and other important questions of quantum foundations. Here we present an overview of recent theoretical
and experimental efforts to underpin the dynamics of entanglement in open quantum systems. Entanglement
is taken as a dynamic quantity, and we survey how it evolves due to the interaction of the entangled
system with its surroundings. We analyze several scenarios, corresponding to different families
of states and environments, which render a diversity of dynamical behaviors. Contrary to single-particle
quantities, that typically vanish only asymptotically in time, entanglement may disappear at
a finite time. Moreover, important classes of entanglement show an exponential decay with the system
size when subject to local noise, posing yet another threat to the already challenging scaling of
quantum technologies. Results for the local and global noise cases are summarized. Robustness-enhancement
techniques, scaling laws, statistical and geometrical aspects of multipartite-entanglement
decay are also reviewed; all in order to give a broad picture of entanglement dynamics in open quantum
systems addressed to both theorists and experimentalists inside and outside the field of quantum
information.
