Hybrid massive MIMO structures with reduced hardware complexity and power consumption have been
widely studied as a potential candidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Channel
estimators that require knowledge of the array response, such as those using compressive sensing
(CS) methods, may suffer from performance degradation when array-inherent impairments bring
unknown phase errors and gain errors to the antenna elements. In this paper, we design matrix completion
(MC)-based channel estimation schemes which are robust against the array-inherent impairments.
We first design an open-loop training scheme that can sample entries from the effective channel
matrix randomly and is compatible with the phase shifter-based hybrid system. Leveraging the low-rank
property of the effective channel matrix, we then design a channel estimator based on the generalized
conditional gradient (GCG) framework and the alternating minimization (AltMin) approach. The
resulting estimator is immune to array-inherent impairments and can be implemented to systems
with any array shapes for its independence of the array response. In addition, we extend our design
to sample a transformed channel matrix following the concept of inductive matrix completion (IMC),
which can be solved efficiently using our proposed estimator and achieve similar performance with
a lower requirement of the dynamic range of the transmission power per antenna. Numerical results
demonstrate the advantages of our proposed MC-based channel estimators in terms of estimation
performance, computational complexity and robustness against array-inherent impairments over
the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based CS channel estimator.
