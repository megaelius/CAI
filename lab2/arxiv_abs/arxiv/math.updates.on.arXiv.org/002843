Pitman(2003)(and subsequently Gnedin and Pitman (2006) showed that a large class of random partitions
of the integers derived from a stable subordinator of index $\alpha\in(0,1)$ have infinite Gibbs
(product) structure as a characterizing feature. The most notable case are random partitions derived
from the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, $\mathrm{PD}(\alpha,\theta)$, which
are induced by mixing over variables with generalized Mittag-Leffler distributions, denoted
by $\mathrm{ML}(\alpha,\theta).$ Our aim in this work is to provide indications on the utility
of the wider class of Gibbs partitions as it relates to a study of Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals
and size-biased sampling, decompositions of special functions, and its potential use in the understanding
of various constructions of more exotic processes. We provide novel characterizations of general
laws associated with two nested families of $\mathrm{PD}(\alpha,\theta)$ mass partitions that
are constructed from notable fragmentation operations described in Dong, Goldschmidt and Martin(2006)
and Pitman(1999), respectively. These operations are known to be related in distribution to various
constructions of discrete random trees/graphs in $[n],$ and their scaling limits, such as stable
trees. A centerpiece of our work are results related to Mittag-Leffler functions, which play a key
role in fractional calculus and are otherwise Laplace transforms of the $\mathrm{ML}(\alpha,\theta)$
variables. Notably, this leads to an interpretation of $\mathrm{PD}(\alpha,\theta)$ laws within
a mixed Poisson waiting time framework based on $\mathrm{ML}(\alpha,\theta)$ variables, which
suggests connections to recent construction of P\'olya urn models with random immigration by Pek\"oz,
R\"ollin and Ross(2018). Simplifications in the Brownian case are highlighted.
