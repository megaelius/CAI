In "Centre of Core Regular Double Stone Algebra" (CRDSA), many useful results are shown that begin
to indicate the nearly Boolean nature of CRDSA which we focus on here. We define the node set lattice
through the well known binary operations of ternary set partitions and show the resultant lattice
is isomorphic to C3^J where C3 is the 3 element chain CRDSA. We derive that every CRDSA is a subdirect
product of C3 similarly as for Boolean algebras and C2. We use these results to show that every Boolean
algebra is the center of some CRDSA. Next we show that C3 is primal implying that the variety generated
by it is dually equivalent to the category of Boolean algebras. In some sense this is a last step towards
our goal of establishing CRDSA as nearly Boolean, but leaves us a bit dissatisfied. Hence we continue
by establishing a duality between the category of CRDSA and specifically crafted bi-topological
spaces. Towards this end we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a pairwise zero-dimensional
space such that it will have a CRDSA base B1. We note that these conditions are indicative of how nearly
Boolean CRDSA are. For example, if u in B1 is not clopen/complemented then Cl(u) is in B1 and is clopen/complemented.
Then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a bi-continuous map to have an inverse
that is a CRDSA homomorphism again indicating how nearly Boolean CRDSA are, these inverses must
respect the appropriate conditions on the boundary of non-clopen elements of B1. In culmination
we show the category of core regular double Stone algebras is dually equivalent to the category of
what we call core regular double pairwise Stone spaces. We note that the conditions for this duality
can easily be relaxed to yield a duality for a less rigid class lattices than CRDSA, bounded distributive
pseudo-complemented lattices for example.
