Functions preserving Loewner positivity when applied entrywise to positive semidefinite matrices
have been widely studied in the literature. Following the work of Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9], Rudin
[Duke Math. J. 26], and others, it is well-known that functions preserving positivity for matrices
of all dimensions are absolutely monotonic (i.e., analytic with nonnegative Taylor coefficients).
In this paper, we study functions preserving positivity when applied entrywise to sparse matrices,
with zeros encoded by a graph $G$ or a family of graphs $G_n$. Our results generalize Schoenberg and
Rudin's results to a modern setting, where functions are often applied entrywise to sparse matrices
in order to improve their properties (e.g. better conditioning). The only such result known in the
literature is for the complete graph $K_2$. We provide the first such characterization result for
a large family of non-complete graphs. Specifically, we characterize functions preserving Loewner
positivity on matrices with zeros according to a tree. These functions are multiplicatively midpoint-convex
and super-additive. Leveraging the underlying sparsity in matrices thus admits the use of functions
which are not necessarily analytic nor absolutely monotonic. We further show that analytic functions
preserving positivity on matrices with zeros according to trees, can contain arbitrarily long
sequences of negative coefficients, thus obviating the need for absolute monotonicity in a very
strong sense. This result leads to the question of exactly when absolute monotonicity is necessary
when preserving positivity for an arbitrary class of graphs. We then provide a stronger condition
in terms of the numerical range of all symmetric matrices, such that functions satisfying this condition
on matrices with zeros according to any family of graphs with unbounded degrees, are necessarily
absolutely monotonic.
