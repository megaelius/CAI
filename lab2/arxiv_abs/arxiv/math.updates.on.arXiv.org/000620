The equation with the time fractional substantial derivative and space fractional derivative
describes the distribution of the functionals of the L\'{e}vy flights; and the equation is derived
as the macroscopic limit of the continuous time random walk in unbounded domain and the L\'{e}vy
flights have divergent second order moments. However, in more practical problems, the physical
domain is bounded and the involved observables have finite moments. Then the modified equation
can be derived by tempering the probability of large jump length of the L\'{e}vy flights and the corresponding
tempered space fractional derivative is introduced. This paper focuses on providing the high order
algorithms for the modified equation, i.e., the equation with the time fractional substantial
derivative and space tempered fractional derivative. More concretely, the contributions of this
paper are as follows: 1. the detailed numerical stability analysis and error estimates of the schemes
with first order accuracy in time and second order in space are given in {\textsl{complex}} space,
which is necessary since the inverse Fourier transform needs to be made for getting the distribution
of the functionals after solving the equation; 2. we further propose the schemes with high order
accuracy in both time and space, and the techniques of treating the issue of keeping the high order
accuracy of the schemes for {\textsl{nonhomogeneous}} boundary/initial conditions are introduced;
3. the multigrid methods are effectively used to solve the obtained algebraic equations which still
have the Toeplitz structure; 4. we perform extensive numerical experiments, including verifying
the high convergence orders, simulating the physical system which needs to numerically make the
inverse Fourier transform to the numerical solutions of the equation.
