This study presents a fractional-order continuum mechanics approach that allows combining selected
characteristics of nonlocal elasticity, typical of classical integral and gradient formulations,
under a single frame-invariant framework. The resulting generalized theory is capable of capturing
both stiffening and softening effects and it is not subject to the inconsistencies often observed
under selected external loads and boundary conditions. The governing equations of a 1D continuum
are derived by continualization of the Lagrangian of a 1D lattice subject to long-range interactions.
This approach is particularly well suited to highlight the connection between the fractional-order
operators and the microscopic properties of the medium. The approach is also extended to derive,
by means of variational principles, the governing equations of a 3D continuum in strong form. The
positive definite potential energy, characteristic of our fractional formulation, always ensures
well-posed governing equations. This aspect, combined with the differ-integral nature of fractional-order
operators, guarantees both stability and the ability to capture dispersion without requiring
additional inertia gradient terms. The proposed formulation is applied to the static and free vibration
analyses of either Timoshenko beams or Mindlin plates. Numerical results, obtained by a fractional-order
finite element method, show that the fractional-order formulation is able to model both stiffening
and softening response in these slender structures. The numerical results provide the foundation
to critically analyze the physical significance of the different fractional model parameters
as well as their effect on the response of the structural elements.
