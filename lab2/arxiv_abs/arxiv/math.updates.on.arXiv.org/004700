We consider a hermitian matrix model with external source and general polynomial potential, when
the source has two distinct eigenvalues but is otherwise arbitrary. All such models studied so far
have a common feature: an associated cubic equation (spectral curve), one of whose solutions is
expressed in terms of the Cauchy transform of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution. This is our
starting point: we show that to any such a spectral curve (not necessarily given by a random matrix
model) it corresponds a unique vector-valued measure with three components on the complex plane,
characterized as a solution of a variational problem stated in terms of their logarithmic energy.
We describe all possible geometries of the supports of these measures: the third component lives
on a contour on the plane and separates the supports of the other measures, both on the real line. This
general result is applied to the random matrix model with external source, showing that any limiting
zero distribution for the average characteristic polynomial can be written in terms of a solution
of a spectral curve, provided a window of the associated recurrence coefficients is bounded. Thus,
any such limiting measure admits the variational description obtained in the first part of the paper.
As a consequence of our work we obtain that density of this limiting measure can have only a handful
of local behaviors: Sine, Airy and their higher order type behavior, Pearcey or yet the fifth power
of the cubic (but no higher order cubics can appear). We also compare our findings with the most general
results available in the literature, showing that once an additional symmetry is imposed, our vector
critical measure contains enough information to recover the solutions to the constrained equilibrium
problem that was known to describe the limiting eigenvalue distribution in this symmetric situation.
