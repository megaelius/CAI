We discover a rigidity phenomenon within the volume-preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms
with $1$-dimensional center. In particular, for smooth, ergodic perturbations of certain algebraic
systems -- including the discretized geodesic flows over hyperbolic manifolds of dimension at
least 3 and linear toral automorphisms with simple spectrum and exactly one eigenvalue on the unit
circle -- if the abelianization of the smooth centralizer has sufficiently high rank, then the centralizer
contains a smooth flow. In dimension $3$, we obtain a global dichotomy: for an ergodic partially
hyperbolic diffeomorphism $f$ that preserves an orientable foliation by circles, either the centralizer
is virtually trivial, or it contains a smooth flow (in which case, up to a finite cover, $f$ is a smooth
isometric extension of an area-preserving Anosov diffeomorphism). At the heart of this work are
two very different rigidity phenomena. The first phenomenon was discovered in [2,3]: for a class
of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic systems including those studied here, the disintegration
of volume along the center foliation is either equivalent to Lebesgue or atomic. The other phenomenon
is the rigidity associated to several commuting partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with very
different hyperbolic behavior transverse to a common center foliation [25]. We introduce a variety
of techniques in the study of higher rank, abelian partially hyperbolic actions: most importantly,
we demonstrate a novel geometric approach to building new partially hyperbolic elements in hyperbolic
Weyl chambers using Pesin theory and leafwise conjugacy, while we also treat measure rigidity for
circle extensions of Anosov diffeomorphisms and apply normal form theory to upgrade regularity
of the centralizer.
