Super-resolution refers to the process of recovering the locations and amplitudes of a collection
of point sources, represented as a discrete measure, given $M+1$ of its noisy low-frequency Fourier
coefficients. The recovery process is highly sensitive to noise whenever the distance $\Delta$
between the two closest point sources is less than $1/M$. This paper studies the {\it fundamental
difficulty of super-resolution} and the {\it performance guarantees of a subspace method called
MUSIC} in the regime that $\Delta<1/M$. The most important quantity in our theory is the minimum
singular value of the Vandermonde matrix whose nodes are specified by the source locations. Under
the assumption that the nodes are closely spaced within several well-separated clumps, we derive
a sharp and non-asymptotic lower bound for this quantity. Our estimate is given as a weighted $\ell^2$
sum, where each term only depends on the configuration of each individual clump. This implies that,
as the noise increases, the super-resolution capability of MUSIC degrades according to a power
law where the exponent depends on the cardinality of the largest clump. Numerical experiments validate
our theoretical bounds for the minimum singular value and the resolution limit of MUSIC. When there
are $S$ point sources located on a grid with spacing $1/N$, the fundamental difficulty of super-resolution
can be quantitatively characterized by a min-max error, which is the reconstruction error incurred
by the best possible algorithm in the worst-case scenario. We show that the min-max error is closely
related to the minimum singular value of Vandermonde matrices, and we provide a non-asymptotic
and sharp estimate for the min-max error, where the dominant term is $(N/M)^{2S-1}$.
