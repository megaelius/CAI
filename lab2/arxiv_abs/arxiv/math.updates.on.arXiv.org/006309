Modelling a large collection of functional time series arises in a broad spectral of real applications.
Under such a scenario, not only the number of functional variables can be diverging with, or even
larger than the number of temporally dependent functional observations, but each function itself
is an infinite-dimensional object, posing a challenging task. In this paper, a standard three-step
procedure is proposed to address such large-scale problems. To provide theoretical guarantees
for the three-step procedure, we focus on multivariate stationary processes and propose a novel
{\it functional stability measure} based on their spectral properties. Such stability measure
facilitates the development of some useful concentration bounds on sample (auto)covariance functions,
which serve as a fundamental tool for further consistency analysis, e.g., for deriving rates of
convergence on the regularized estimates in high-dimensional settings. As {\it functional principal
component analysis} (FPCA) is one of the key dimension reduction techniques in the first step, we
also investigate the consistency properties of the relevant estimated terms under a FPCA framework.
To illustrate with an important application, we consider vector functional autoregressive models
and develop a regularization approach to estimate autoregressive coefficient functions under
the sparsity constraint. Using our derived convergence results, we investigate the theoretical
properties of the regularized estimate under high-dimensional scaling. Finally, the finite-sample
performance of the proposed method is examined through both simulations and a public financial
dataset.
