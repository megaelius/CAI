Erd\"os conjectured that the set J of limit points of d_n/logn contains all nonnegative numbers,
where d_n denotes the nth primegap. The author proved a year ago (arXiv: 1305.6289 ) that J contains
an interval of type [0,c] with a positive ineffective value c. In the present work we extend this result
for a large class of normalizing functions. The only essential requirement is that the function
f(n) replacing logn should satisfy f(n)<<lognloglognloglogloglogn/(logloglogn)^2
(with a small implied constant), the well-known Erd\"os-Rankin bound for the largest known gaps
between consecutive primes. The work also proves that apart from a thin set of exceptional functions
the original Erd\"os conjecture holds if logn is replaced by a non-exceptional function f(n). The
paper also gives a new proof for a result of Helmut Maier which generalized the Erd\"os-Rankin bound
for an arbitrarily long finite chain of consecutive primegaps. The proof uses a combination of methods
of Erd\"os-Rankin,Maynard-Tao and Banks-Freiberg-Maynard. Since the submission of the present
work the very important recent simultaneous and independent works of Ford-Green-Konjagin-Tao
( arXiv:1408.4505 [math.NT] and Maynard (aerXiv: 1408.5110 [math.NT]) appeared on arXiv and they
proved the old conjecture of Erd\"os which asserts that the lower bound for large gaps exceeds Clognloglognloglogloglogn/(logloglogn)^2
with an arbitrarily large constant C. In this new version we prove the same assertions as in the original
work for the case when f(n)<<Clognloglognloglogloglogn/(logloglogn)^2 with an arbi8trarily
large constant C, in particular we show that there are blocks of m primes for any m such that all gaps
between these primes simultaneously satisfy the lower estimate Clognloglognloglogloglogn/(logloglogn)^2
with an arbitrarily large constant C. The proof uses the method of Maynard.
