Slice Fueter-regular functions, originally called slice Dirac-regular functions, are generalized
holomorphic functions defined over the octonion algebra $\mathbb{O}$, recently introduced by
M. Jin, G. Ren and I. Sabadini. A function $f:\Omega_D\subset\mathbb{O}\to\mathbb{O}$ is called
(quaternionic) slice Fueter-regular if, given any quaternionic subalgebra $\mathbb{H}_\mathbb{I}$
of $\mathbb{O}$ generated by a pair $\mathbb{I}=(I,J)$ of orthogonal imaginary units $I$ and $J$
($\mathbb{H}_\mathbb{I}$ is a `quaternionic slice' of $\mathbb{O}$), the restriction of $f$
to $\Omega_D\cap\mathbb{H}_\mathbb{I}$ belongs to the kernel of the corresponding Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter
operator $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_0}+I\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}+J\frac{\partial}{\partial
x_2}+(IJ)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_3}$. The goal of this paper is to show that slice Fueter-regular
functions are standard (complex) slice functions, whose stem functions satisfy a Vekua system
having exactly the same form of the one characterizing axially monogenic functions of degree zero.
The mentioned standard sliceness of slice Fueter-regular functions is able to reveal their `holomorphic
nature': slice Fueter-regular functions have Cauchy integral formulas, Taylor and Laurent series
expansions, and a version of Maximum Modulus Principle, and each of these properties is global in
the sense that it is true on genuine $8$-dimesional domains of $\mathbb{O}$. Slice Fueter-regular
functions are real analytic. Furthermore, we introduce the global concepts of spherical Dirac
operator $\Gamma$ and of slice Fueter operator $\bar{\vartheta}_F$ over octonions, which allow
to characterize slice Fueter-regular functions as the $\mathscr{C}^2$-functions in the kernel
of $\bar{\vartheta}_F$ satisfying a second order differential system associated with $\Gamma$.
The paper contains eight open problems.
