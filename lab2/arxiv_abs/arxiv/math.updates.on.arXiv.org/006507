We study 2-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type from the viewpoint of measure equivalence,
and establish strong rigidity statements. We first prove that they are boundary amenable -- as is
more generally every group acting discretely by isometries on a connected piecewise hyperbolic
CAT(-1) simplicial complex with countably many simplices in finitely many isometry types, under
the assumption that vertex stabilizers are boundary amenable. As a byproduct, these groups satisfy
the Novikov conjecture. We find an infinite collection $\mathcal{C}$ of Artin groups (already
considered by Crisp in his work on abstract commensurators) which are superrigid for measure equivalence:
every countable group which is measure equivalent to a group $G$ in the class $\mathcal{C}$, is almost
isomorphic to $G$. We also get measure equivalence classification results within the class of Artin
groups. More precisely, we prove that whenever two 2-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type
are measure equivalent, then there is an isomorphism between their fixed set graphs -- these graphs
were introduced by Crisp and constitute a natural analogue of the curve graph in the realm of Artin
groups. This can be reformulated in terms of orbit equivalence rigidity of actions of 2-dimensional
Artin groups of hyperbolic type. As many of these groups are properly proximal in the sense of Boutonnet,
Ioana and Peterson, this also yields strong rigidity results for von Neumann algebras associated
to their ergodic actions. In particular, we build a new infinite class of examples of groups all of
whose ergodic probability measure-preserving actions are $W^*$-superrigid. Other applications
of our work include a superrigidity statement for cocycles from higher-rank lattices to 2-dimensional
Artin groups of hyperbolic type, and a rigidity statement regarding possible lattice embeddings
of certain Artin groups.
