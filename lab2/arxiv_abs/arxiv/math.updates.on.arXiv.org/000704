In 1878 \'E. Lucas proved a remarkable result which provides a simple way to compute the binomial
coefficient ${n\choose m}$ modulo a prime $p$ in terms of the binomial coefficients of the base-$p$
digits of $n$ and $m$: {\it If $p$ is a prime, $n=n_0+n_1p+\cdots +n_sp^s$ and $m=m_0+m_1p+\cdots
+m_sp^s$ are the $p$-adic expansions of nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$, then \begin{equation*}
{n\choose m}\equiv \prod_{i=0}^{s}{n_i\choose m_i}\pmod{p}. \end{equation*}} The above congruence,
the so-called {\it Lucas' theorem} (or {\it Theorem of Lucas}), plays an important role in Number
Theory and Combinatorics. In this article, consisting of six sections, we provide a historical
survey of Lucas type congruences, generalizations of Lucas' theorem modulo prime powers, Lucas
like theorems for some generalized binomial coefficients, and some their applications. In Section
1 we present the fundamental congruences modulo a prime including the famous Lucas' theorem. In
Section 2 we mention several known proofs and some consequences of Lucas' theorem. In Section 3 we
present a number of extensions and variations of Lucas' theorem modulo prime powers. In Section
4 we consider the notions of the Lucas property and the double Lucas property, where we also present
numerous integer sequences satisfying one of these properties or a certain Lucas type congruence.
In Section 5 we collect several known Lucas type congruences for some generalized binomial coefficients.
In particular, this concerns the Fibonomial coefficients, the Lucas $u$-nomial coefficients,
the Gaussian $q$-nomial coefficients and their generalizations. Finally, some applications
of Lucas' theorem in Number Theory and Combinatorics are given in Section 6.
