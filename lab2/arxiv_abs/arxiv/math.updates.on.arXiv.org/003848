We consider a generalization of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups for
some non-abelian groups, which is called OGS. First, we consider the dihedral group, which is a non-abelian
extension of an abelian group by an involution. Then, we focus on a special case, where the abelian
group is cyclic, which is the two-generated Coxeter group I{2}(m). We mention interesting connections
between the reduced Coxeter presentation and a particular OGS canonical presentation, which we
call the standard OGS canonical presentation. These connections motivate us to offer a generalization
of the standard OGS to the A-type Coxeter group, which can be considered as the dual family to the I-type
Coxeter groups. The n-1 generated A-type Coxeter groups can be considered as the symmetric group
S{n} for an arbitrary n. We mention the standard and the dual-standard OGS of S{n}, where, The standard
OGS canonical form of S{n} has a special interest in combinatorics, since in 2001, R. M. Adin, and
Y. Roichman has proved that sum of the exponents in the canonical form is coincide with the major-index
of the permutation, which is equi-disributed with the Coxeter length. In this paper we extend the
results of Adin and Roichman very significantly, where we show interesting properties of the exchange
laws, we define standard OGS elementary factorization, which connects between the standard OGS
and the descent set of a permutation. Then, by using the standard OGS elementary factorization,
we find a new explicit formula for the Coxeter length of an element of S{n}, and we give a new algorithm
for the standard OGS canonical form and the descent set of the inverse element of an arbitrary element
of S{n}.
