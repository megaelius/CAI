We investigate when non-dictatorial aggregation is possible from an algorithmic perspective,
where non-dictatorial aggregation means that the votes cast by the members of a society can be aggregated
in such a way that the collective outcome is not simply the choices made by a single member of the society.
We consider the setting in which the members of a society take a position on a fixed collection of issues,
where for each issue several different alternatives are possible, but the combination of choices
must belong to a given set $X$ of allowable voting patterns. Such a set $X$ is called a possibility
domain if there is an aggregator that is non-dictatorial, operates separately on each issue, and
returns values among those cast by the society on each issue. We design a polynomial-time algorithm
that decides, given a set $X$ of voting patterns, whether or not $X$ is a possibility domain. Furthermore,
if $X$ is a possibility domain, then the algorithm constructs in polynomial time such a non-dictatorial
aggregator for $X$. We then show that the question of whether a Boolean domain $X$ is a possibility
domain is in NLOGSPACE. We also design a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether $X$ is a
uniform possibility domain, that is, whether $X$ admits an aggregator that is non-dictatorial
even when restricted to any two positions for each issue. As in the case of possibility domains, the
algorithm also constructs in polynomial time a uniform non-dictatorial aggregator, if one exists.
Then, we turn our attention to the case where $X$ is given implicitly, either as the set of assignments
satisfying a propositional formula, or as a set of consistent evaluations of an sequence of propositional
formulas. In both cases, we provide bounds to the complexity of deciding if $X$ is a (uniform) possibility
domain.
