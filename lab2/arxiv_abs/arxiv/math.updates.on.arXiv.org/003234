Recent decades are put lots of efforts to develop a higher-order scheme for convective terms approximation
that is stable and reliable. The idea presented here is that approximation approach has to correspond
to the physical phenomenon described by approximated terms. Pure convection (advection) that
is described by convective terms is transporting a property along the streamline, and the information
propagation is unidirectional, i.e., transported property depends on previous values along the
streamline but does not depend on the next ones. The proposed approach represents streamlines on
mesh as discrete streamlines and is called Discrete Stream(line) Method (DStreaM). A discrete
streamline here is represented as a narrow triangle with one vertex of the approximated node and
two others neighbor upstream nodes. Discrete streamlines are orientated using local flow direction
as skew upwind schemes. DStreaM corresponds to pure convection. Here are considered standard test
problems: advection of a step profile, advection of a double-step profile, advection of a sinusoidal
profile, and Smith and Hutton problem. DStreaM solutions were compared with upwind-first order
scheme and second-order Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) schemes with limiters Min-Mod, QUICK,
and SUPERBEE solutions. DStreaM demonstrated second-order accuracy and rapid convergence. Upwind
and DStreaM need 2 or 4 iterations to reach a final solution while TVD schemes need from 15 to 93.5 more
iterations. DStreaM approach looks promising for calculation of convective-dominated problems
because it approximates naturally first derivatives and is straightforwardly applicable as a
meshfree method or on unstructured meshes.
