The family of the complex Grassmann manifolds $G_{n,k}$ with a canonical action of the torus $T^n=\mathbb{T}^{n}$
and the analogue of the moment map $\mu : G_{n,k}\to \Delta _{n,k}$ for the hypersimplex $\Delta
_{n,k}$, is well known. In this paper we study the structure of the orbit space $G_{n,k}/T^n$ by developing
the methods of toric geometry and toric topology. We use a subdivision of $G_{n,k}$ into the strata
$W_{\sigma}$. Relying on this subdivision we determine all regular and singular points of the moment
map $\mu$, introduce the notion of the admissible polytopes $P_\sigma$ such that $\mu (W_{\sigma})
= \stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}}$ and the notion of the spaces of parameters $F_{\sigma}$, which
together describe $W_{\sigma}/T^{n}$ as the product $\stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}} \times
F_{\sigma}$. To find the appropriate topology for the set $\cup _{\sigma} \stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}}
\times F_{\sigma}$ we introduce also the notions of the universal space of parameters $\tilde{\mathcal{F}}$
and the virtual spaces of parameters $\tilde{F}_{\sigma}\subset \tilde{\mathcal{F}}$ such
that there exist the projections $\tilde{F}_{\sigma}\to F_{\sigma}$. Having this in mind, we
propose a method for the description of the orbit space $G_{n,k}/T^n$. In our previous paper we proved
that the orbit space $G_{4,2}/T^4$, which is defined by the canonical $T^4$-action of complexity
$1$, is homeomorphic to $\partial \Delta _{4,2}\ast \mathbb{C} P^1$. In this paper we obtain an
explicit description of the orbit space $G_{5,2}/T^5$, which is defined by the canonical $T^5$-action
of complexity $2$, and prove that it is homotopy equivalent to $(\partial \Delta _{4,2}\ast \mathbb{C}
P^1)\vee (\partial \Delta _{5,2}\ast \mathbb{C} P^{2})$. The methods and the results of this paper
are very important for the construction of the theory of $(2l,q)$-manifolds we have been recently
developing.
