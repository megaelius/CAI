This thesis studies the model theoretic properties of the Description Logics (DLs) ALC, ALCI, ALCQ,
as well as ALCO, ALCQO, ALCQIO and EL. TBoxes of ALC, ALCI and ALCQ are characterised as fragments
of FO which are invariant under global bisimulation and disjoint unions. The logics ALCO, ALCQO
and ALCQIO, which incorporate individuals, are characterised w.r.t. to the class K of all interpretations
which interpret individuals as singleton sets. The characterisations for TBoxes of ALCO and ALCQO
both require additionally that an FO-sentence is, under certain circumstances, preserved under
forward generated subinterpretations. FO-sentences equivalent to ALCQIO-TBoxes, are - due to
ALCQIO's inverse roles - characterised similarly but are required to be preserved under generated
subinterpretations. EL as sub-boolean DL is characterised on concept level as the FO-fragment
which is preserved under simulation and preserved under direct products. Equally valid is the characterisation
by being preserved under simulation and having minimal models. For EL-TBoxes, a global version
of simulation was not sufficient but FO-sentences of EL-TBoxes are invariant under global equi-simulation,
disjoint unions and direct products. For each of these description logics, the characteristic
concepts are explicated and the characterisation is accompanied by an investigation under which
notion of saturation the logic in hand enjoys the Hennessy-and-Milner-Property. As application
of the results we determine the minimal globally bisimilar companion w.r.t. ALCQO-bisimulation
and introduce the L1-to-L2-rewritability problem for TBoxes, where L1 and L2 are (description)
logics. The latter is the problem to decide whether or not an L1-TBox can be equivalently expressed
as L2-TBox. We give algorithms which decide ALCI-to-ALC-rewritability and ALC-to-EL-rewritability.
