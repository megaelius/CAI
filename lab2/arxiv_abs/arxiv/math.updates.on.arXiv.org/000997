Suppose that $f\colon X\to\mathrm{Spec}\, R$ is a minimal model of a complete local Gorenstein
3-fold, where the fibres of $f$ are at most one dimensional, so by \cite{VdB1d} there is a noncommutative
ring $\Lambda$ derived equivalent to $X$. For any collection of curves above the origin, we show
that this collection contracts to a point without contracting a divisor if and only if a certain factor
of $\Lambda$ is finite dimensional, improving a result of \cite{DW2}. We further show that the mutation
functor of \cite[\S6]{IW4} is functorially isomorphic to the inverse of the Bridgeland--Chen
flop functor in the case when the factor of $\Lambda$ is finite dimensional. These results then allow
us to jump between all the minimal models of $\mathrm{Spec}\, R$ in an algorithmic way, without having
to compute the geometry at each stage. We call this process the Homological MMP. This has several
applications in GIT approaches to derived categories, and also to birational geometry. First,
using mutation we are able to compute the full GIT chamber structure by passing to surfaces. We say
precisely which chambers give the distinct minimal models, and also say which walls give flops and
which do not, enabling us to prove the Craw--Ishii conjecture in this setting. Second, we are able
to precisely count the number of minimal models, and also give bounds for both the maximum and the
minimum numbers of minimal models based only on the dual graph enriched with scheme theoretic multiplicity.
Third, we prove a bijective correspondence between maximal modifying $R$-module generators and
minimal models, and for each such pair in this correspondence give a further correspondence linking
the endomorphism ring and the geometry. This lifts the Auslander--McKay correspondence to dimension
three.
