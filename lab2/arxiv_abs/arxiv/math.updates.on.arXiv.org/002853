The class of quasi-graphic matroids recently introduced by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle generalises
each of the classes of frame matroids and lifted-graphic matroids introduced earlier by Zaslavsky.
For each biased graph $(G, \mathcal B)$ Zaslavsky defined a unique lift matroid $L(G, \mathcal B)$
and a unique frame matroid $F(G, \mathcal B)$, each on ground set $E(G)$. We show that in general there
may be many quasi-graphic matroids on $E(G)$ and describe them all. We provide cryptomorphic descriptions
in terms of subgraphs corresponding to circuits, cocircuits, independent sets, and bases. Equipped
with these descriptions, we prove some results about quasi-graphic matroids. In particular, we
provide alternate proofs that do not require 3-connectivity of two results of Geelen, Gerards,
and Whittle for 3-connected matroids from their introductory paper: namely, that every quasi-graphic
matroid linearly representable over a field is either lifted-graphic or frame, and that if a matroid
$M$ has a framework with a loop that is not a loop of $M$ then $M$ is either lifted-graphic or frame.
We also provide sufficient conditions for a quasi-graphic matroid to have a unique framework. Zaslavsky
has asked for those matroids whose independent sets are contained in the collection of independent
sets of $F(G, \mathcal B)$ while containing those of $L(G, \mathcal B)$, for some biased graph $(G,
\mathcal B)$. Adding a natural (and necessary) non-degeneracy condition defines a class of matroids,
which we call biased graphic. We show that the class of biased graphic matroids almost coincides
with the class of quasi-graphic matroids: every quasi-graphic matroid is biased graphic, and if
$M$ is a biased graphic matroid that is not quasi-graphic then $M$ is a 2-sum of a frame matroid with
one or more lifted-graphic matroids.
