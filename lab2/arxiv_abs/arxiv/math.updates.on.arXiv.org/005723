The idea of Innovation Search was proposed as a data clustering method in which the directions of
innovation were utilized to compute the adjacency matrix and it was shown that Innovation Pursuit
can notably outperform the self representation based subspace clustering methods. In this paper,
we present a new discovery that the directions of innovation can be used to design a provable and strong
robust (to outlier) PCA method. The proposed approach, dubbed iSearch, uses the direction search
optimization problem to compute an optimal direction corresponding to each data point. iSearch
utilizes the directions of innovation to measure the innovation of the data points and it identifies
the outliers as the most innovative data points. Analytical performance guarantees are derived
for the proposed robust PCA method under different models for the distribution of the outliers including
randomly distributed outliers, clustered outliers, and linearly dependent outliers. In addition,
we study the problem of outlier detection in a union of subspaces and it is shown that iSearch provably
recovers the span of the inliers when the inliers lie in a union of subspaces. Moreover, we present
theoretical studies which show that the proposed measure of innovation remains stable in the presence
of noise and the performance of iSearch is robust to noisy data. In the challenging scenarios in which
the outliers are close to each other or they are close to the span of the inliers, iSearch is shown to
remarkably outperform most of the existing methods. The presented method shows that the directions
of innovation are useful representation of the data which can be used to perform both data clustering
and outlier detection.
