We consider a class of nonsmooth optimization problems over the Stiefel manifold, in which the objective
function is weakly convex in the ambient Euclidean space. Such problems are ubiquitous in engineering
applications but still largely unexplored. We present a family of Riemannian subgradient-type
methods---namely Riemannain subgradient, incremental subgradient, and stochastic subgradient
methods---to solve these problems and show that they all have an iteration complexity of ${\cal
O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ for driving a natural stationarity measure below $\varepsilon$. In addition,
we establish the local linear convergence of the Riemannian subgradient and incremental subgradient
methods when the problem at hand further satisfies a sharpness property and the algorithms are properly
initialized and use geometrically diminishing stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the first convergence guarantees for using Riemannian subgradient-type methods to optimize a
class of nonconvex nonsmooth functions over the Stiefel manifold. The fundamental ingredient
in the proof of the aforementioned convergence results is a new Riemannian subgradient inequality
for restrictions of weakly convex functions on the Stiefel manifold, which could be of independent
interest. We also show that our convergence results can be extended to handle a class of compact embedded
submanifolds of the Euclidean space. Finally, we discuss the sharpness properties of various formulations
of the robust subspace recovery and orthogonal dictionary learning problems and demonstrate the
convergence performance of the algorithms on both problems via numerical simulations.
