Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems with jumps and piecewise differentiable parameters is
a class of hybrid LPV systems for which no tailored stability analysis and stabilization conditions
have been obtained so far. We fill this gap here by proposing an approach relying on the reformulation
of the considered LPV system as an impulsive system that will incorporate, through a suitable state
augmentation, information on both the dynamics of the state of the system and the considered class
of parameter trajectories. Conditions for the stability of the hybrid system, and hence that of
the associated LPV system, under both constant and minimum dwell-time are established. Those results
are based on the use of a clock- and parameter-dependent Lyapunov function that is enforced to be
decreasing along the flow and the jumps of the system. An interesting adaptation of this result consists
of a minimum dwell-time stability condition for LPV switched impulsive systems with time-varying
dimensions. The minimum dwell-time stability condition is notably shown to naturally generalize
and unify the well-known quadratic and robust stability criteria all together. Those conditions
are then adapted to address the stabilization problem via timer-dependent and a timer- and/or parameter-independent
(i.e. robust) state-feedback controllers. Finally, the last part addresses the stability of LPV
systems with jumps under a range dwell-time condition which is then used to provide stabilization
condition for LPV systems using a sampled-data state-feedback gain-scheduled controller. The
obtained stability and stabilization conditions are formulated as infinite-dimensional semidefinite
programming problems which are solved using a relaxation approach based on sum of squares programming.
Examples are given for illustration of the results.
