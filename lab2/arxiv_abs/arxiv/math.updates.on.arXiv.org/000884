The main objective of this thesis is the study of the evolution under the Ricci flow of surfaces with
singularities of cone type. A second objective, emerged from the techniques we use, is the study
of families of Ricci flow solitons in dimension 2 and 3. The Ricci flow is an evolution equation for
Riemannian manifolds, introduced by R. Hamilton in 1982. It is from the achievements made by G. Perelman
with this technique in 2002 when the Ricci flow has been established in a discipline itself, generating
a great interest in the community. This thesis contains four original results. First result is a
complete classification of solitons in smooth and cone surfaces. This classification completes
the preceding results found by Hamilton, Chow and Wu and others, and we obtain explicit descriptions
of all solitons in dimension 2. Second result is a Geometrization of cone surfaces by Ricci flow.
This result, which uses the aforementioned first result, extends the theory of Hamilton to the singular
case. This is the most comprehensive result in the thesis, for which we use and develop analysis and
PDE techniques, as well as comparison geometry techniques. Third result is the existence of a Ricci
flow that removes cone singularities. This clearly exposes the non-uniqueness of solutions to
the flow , in analogy to the Ricci flow with cusps of P. Topping. The fourth result is the construction
of a new expanding gradient Ricci soliton in dimension 3. Just as we do with solitons on cone surfaces,
we give an explicit construction using techniques of phase portraits. We also prove that this is
the only soliton with its topology and its lower bound of the curvature, and besides this is a critical
case amongst all expanding solitons in dimension 3 with curvature bounded below.
