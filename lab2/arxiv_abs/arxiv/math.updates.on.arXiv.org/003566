We consider the problem of testing, on the basis of a $p$-variate Gaussian random sample, the null
hypothesis ${\cal H}_0: {\pmb \theta}_1= {\pmb \theta}_1^0$ against the alternative ${\cal H}_1:
{\pmb \theta}_1 \neq {\pmb \theta}_1^0$, where ${\pmb \theta}_1$ is the "first" eigenvector of
the underlying covariance matrix and ${\pmb \theta}_1^0$ is a fixed unit $p$-vector. In the classical
setup where eigenvalues $\lambda_1>\lambda_2\geq \ldots\geq \lambda_p$ are fixed, the Anderson
(1963) likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the Hallin, Paindaveine and Verdebout (2010) Le Cam optimal
test for this problem are asymptotically equivalent under the null hypothesis, hence also under
sequences of contiguous alternatives. We show that this equivalence does not survive asymptotic
scenarios where $\lambda_{n1}/\lambda_{n2}=1+O(r_n)$ with $r_n=O(1/\sqrt{n})$. For such
scenarios, the Le Cam optimal test still asymptotically meets the nominal level constraint, whereas
the LRT severely overrejects the null hypothesis. Consequently, the former test should be favored
over the latter one whenever the two largest sample eigenvalues are close to each other. By relying
on the Le Cam's asymptotic theory of statistical experiments, we study the non-null and optimality
properties of the Le Cam optimal test in the aforementioned asymptotic scenarios and show that the
null robustness of this test is not obtained at the expense of power. Our asymptotic investigation
is extensive in the sense that it allows $r_n$ to converge to zero at an arbitrary rate. While we restrict
to single-spiked spectra of the form $\lambda_{n1}>\lambda_{n2}=\ldots=\lambda_{np}$ to make
our results as striking as possible, we extend our results to the more general elliptical case. Finally,
we present an illustrative real data example.
