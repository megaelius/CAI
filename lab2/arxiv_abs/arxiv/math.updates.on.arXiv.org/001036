Preconditioned Krylov subspace (KSP) methods are widely used for solving large and sparse linear
systems arising from PDE discretizations. For modern applications, these linear systems are often
nonsymmetric due to the nature of the PDEs, jump conditions, or discretization methods. While some
preconditioned KSP methods are readily available, it is often unclear to users which methods are
the best for different classes of problems. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of some
KSP methods, including GMRES, TFQMR, BiCGSTAB, and QMRCGSTAB, coupled with three classes of preconditioners,
namely Gauss-Seidel, incomplete LU factorization (including ILUT, ILUTP and multilevel ILU),
and algebraic multigrid (including classical AMG and smoothed aggregation). We assess these methods
using nonsymmetric linear systems from PDE discretization in 2D and 3D with up to $10^7$ unknowns.
We compare the convergence and runtimes and assess the asymptotic complexity of these methods with
respect to the number of unknowns. Our results show that GMRES tends to deliver the best performance
when coupled with AMG preconditioners, but it is often less competitive due to restarts when using
a less effective preconditioner. We observe that the classical AMG with proper choice of coarsening
and interpolation techniques delivers better performance than smoothed aggregation, but both
methods may fail for saddle-point problems while ILUTP and multilevel ILU succeed. We also show
that right preconditioning is more reliable than left preconditioning. This study helps establish
some practical guidelines for choosing preconditioned KSP methods and motivates the further development
of more effective multigrid preconditioners.
