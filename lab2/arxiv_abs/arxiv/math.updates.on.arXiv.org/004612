Local cancer cell invasion is a complex process involving many cellular and tissue interactions
and is an important prerequisite for metastatic spread, the main cause of cancer related deaths.
Occurring over many different temporal and spatial scales, the first stage of local invasion is
the secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes (MDEs) and the resulting degradation of the extra-cellular
matrix (ECM). This process creates space in which the cells can invade and thus enlarge the tumour.
As a tumour increases in malignancy, the cancer cells adopt the ability to mutate into secondary
cell subpopulations giving rise to a heterogeneous tumour. This new cell subpopulation often carries
higher invasive qualities and permits a quicker spread of the tumour. Building upon the recent multiscale
modelling framework for cancer invasion within a fibrous ECM introduced in Shuttleworth and Trucu
(2019), in this paper we consider the process of local invasion by a heterotypic tumour consisting
of two cancer cell populations mixed with a two-phase ECM. To that end, we address the double feedback
link between the tissue-scale cancer dynamics and the cell-scale molecular processes through
the development of a two-part modelling framework that crucially incorporates the multiscale
dynamic redistribution of oriented fibres occurring within a two-phase extra-cellular matrix
and combines this with the multiscale leading edge dynamics exploring key matrix-degrading enzymes
molecular processes along the tumour interface that drive the movement of the cancer boundary.
The modelling framework will be accompanied by computational results that explore the effects
of the underlying fibre network on the overall pattern of cancer invasion.
