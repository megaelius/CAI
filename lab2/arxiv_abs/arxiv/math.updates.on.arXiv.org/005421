We develop further quaternionic analysis introducing left and right doubly regular functions.
We derive Cauchy-Fueter type formulas for these doubly regular functions that can be regarded as
another counterpart of Cauchy's integral formula for the second order pole, in addition to the one
studied in the first paper with the same title. We also realize the doubly regular functions as a subspace
of the quaternionic-valued functions satisfying a Euclidean version of Maxwell's equations for
the electromagnetic field. Then we return to the study of the original quaternionic analogue of
Cauchy's second order pole formula and its relation to the polarization of vacuum. We find the decomposition
of the space of quaternionic-valued functions into irreducible components that include the spaces
of doubly left and right regular functions. Using this decomposition, we show that a regularization
of the vacuum polarization diagram is achieved by subtracting the component corresponding to the
one-dimensional subrepresentation of the conformal group. After the regularization, the vacuum
polarization diagram is identified with a certain second order differential operator which yields
a quaternionic version of Maxwell equations. Next, we introduce two types of quaternionic algebras
consisting of spaces of scalar-valued and quaternionic-valued functions. We emphasize that these
algebra structures are invariant under the action of the conformal Lie algebra. This uses techniques
from our study of the vacuum polarization diagram. These algebras are not associative, but we can
define an infinite family of n-multiplications, and we conjecture that they have structures of
weak cyclic A-infinity algebras. We also conjecture the relation between the multiplication operations
of the scalar and non-scalar quaternionic algebras with the n-photon Feynman diagrams in the scalar
and ordinary conformal QED.
