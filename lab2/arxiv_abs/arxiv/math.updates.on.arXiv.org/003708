In this paper we propose a splitting scheme which hybridizes generalized conditional gradient
with a proximal step which we call CGALP algorithm, for minimizing the sum of three proper convex
and lower-semicontinuous functions in real Hilbert spaces. The minimization is subject to an affine
constraint, that allows in particular to deal with composite problems (sum of more than three functions)
in a separate way by the usual product space technique. While classical conditional gradient methods
require Lipschitz-continuity of the gradient of the differentiable part of the objective, CGALP
needs only differentiability (on an appropriate subset), hence circumventing the intricate question
of Lipschitz continuity of gradients. For the two remaining functions in the objective, we do not
require any additional regularity assumption. The second function, possibly nonsmooth, is assumed
simple, i.e., the associated proximal mapping is easily computable. For the third function, again
nonsmooth, we just assume that its domain is also bounded and that a linearly perturbed minimization
oracle is accessible. In particular, this last function can be chosen to be the indicator of a nonempty
bounded closed convex set, in order to deal with additional constraints. Finally, the affine constraint
is addressed by the augmented Lagrangian approach. Our analysis is carried out for a wide choice
of algorithm parameters satisfying so called "open loop" rules. As main results, under mild conditions,
we show asymptotic feasibility with respect to the affine constraint, boundedness of the dual multipliers,
and convergence of the Lagrangian values to the saddle-point optimal value. We also provide (subsequential)
rates of convergence for both the feasibility gap and the Lagrangian values.
