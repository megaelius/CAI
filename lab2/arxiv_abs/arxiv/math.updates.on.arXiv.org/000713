This text is about spiked models of non Hermitian random matrices. More specifically, we consider
matrices of the type $A+P$, where the rank of $P$ stays bounded as the dimension goes to infinity and
where the matrix $A$ is a non Hermitian random matrix, satisfying an isotropy hypothesis: its distribution
is invariant under the left and right actions of the unitary group. The macroscopic eigenvalue distribution
of such matrices is governed by the so called Single Ring Theorem, due to Guionnet, Krishnapur and
Zeitouni. We first prove that if $P$ has some eigenvalues out of the maximal circle of the single ring,
then $A+P$ has some eigenvalues (called outliers) in the neighborhood of those of $P$, which is not
the case for the eigenvalues of $P$ in the inner cycle of the single ring. Then, we study the fluctuations
of the outliers of $A$ around the eigenvalues of $P$ and prove that they are distributed as the eigenvalues
of some finite dimensional random matrices. Such facts had already been noticed for Hermitian models.
More surprising facts are that outliers can here have very various rates of convergence to their
limits (depending on the Jordan Canonical Form of $P$) and that some correlations can appear between
outliers at a macroscopic distance from each other (a fact already noticed by Knowles and Yin in the
Hermitian case, but only in the case of non Gaussian models, whereas spiked Gaussian matrices belong
to our model and can have such correlated outliers). Our first result generalizes a previous result
by Tao for matrices with i.i.d. entries, whereas the second one (about the fluctuations) is new.
