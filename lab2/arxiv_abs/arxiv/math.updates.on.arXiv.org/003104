The a posteriori error estimate and greedy algorithms play central roles in reduced basis method
(RBM). A classic RBM uses residual error estimator. The error is estimated in some parameter independent
genetic norm and an estimation of the stability constant is also needed. This type of error estimate
is not robust with respect to the parameter-dependent energy norm, and it measures only the difference
between the RB solution and an unrealistic "truth" finite element solution. The choice of the RB
error tolerance is often heuristic and will cause under or over-computing. The finite element solutions
for RB snapshots are often computed on a non-optimal mesh, or only computed on a mesh which is good
for some parameters in the RB parameter set but not for others. With the parametric reaction-diffusion
and diffusion equations as examples, for a class of parametric convex minimization variational
problems, we develop primal-dual reduced basis methods (PD-RBM) with robust true error certifications
and adaptive greedy algorithms to overcome the shortcomings of the classic a posteriori error estimator
and greedy algorithms in RBM. For convex minimization variational problems, the duality gap between
the primal and dual functionals is a perfect a posteriori error estimator. This primal dual error
estimator is robust with respect to the parameters of the problem, and it can be used for both the mesh
refinements of finite element methods and the true RB error certification. We develop three versions
of adaptive greedy algorithms to balance the finite element error, the exact reduced basis error,
and the adaptive mesh refinements. Extensive numerical tests are performed to test the PD-RBM for
three greedy algorithms.
