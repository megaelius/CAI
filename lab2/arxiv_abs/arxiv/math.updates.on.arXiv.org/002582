Relay systems improve both coverage and system capacity. Towards this direction, full-duplex
(FD) technology, being able to boost the spectral efficiency by transmitting and receiving simultaneously
on the same frequency and time resources, is envisaged to play a key role in future networks. However,
its benefits come at the expense of self-interference (SI) from their own transmit signal. At the
same time, massive MIMO systems, bringing unconventionally many antennas, emerge as a promising
technology with huge degrees-of-freedom (DoF). To this end, this paper considers a multi-pair
decode-and-forward FD relay channel, where the relay station is deployed with a large number of
antennas. Moreover, the rate-splitting (RS) transmission has recently been shown to provide significant
performance benefits in various multi-user scenarios with imperfect channel state information
at the transmitter (CSIT). Engaging the RS approach, we employ the deterministic equivalent (DE)
analysis to derive the corresponding sum-rates in the presence of interferences. Initially, numerical
results demonstrate the robustness of RS in half-duplex (HD) systems, since the achievable sum-rate
increases without bound, i.e., it does not saturate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Next,
we tackle the detrimental effect of SI in FD. In particular, and most importantly, not only FD outperforms
HD, but also RS enables increasing the range of SI over which FD outperforms HD. Furthermore, increasing
the number of relay station antennas, RS appears to be more efficacious due to imperfect CSIT, since
SI decreases. Interestingly, increasing the number of users, the efficiency of RS worsens and its
implementation becomes less favorable under these conditions. Finally, we verify that the proposed
DEs, being accurate for a large number of relay station antennas, are tight approximations even
for realistic system dimensions.
