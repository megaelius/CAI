We consider pattern-forming fronts in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with a traveling spatial
heterogeneity which destabilizes, or quenches, the trivial ground state while progressing through
the domain. We consider the regime where the heterogeneity propagates with speed $c$ just below
the linear invasion speed of the pattern-forming front in the associated homogeneous system. In
this situation, the front locks to the interface of the heterogeneity leaving a long intermediate
state lying near the unstable ground state, possibly allowing for growth of perturbations. This
manifests itself in the spectrum of the linearization about the front through the accumulation
of eigenvalues onto the absolute spectrum associated with the unstable ground state. As the quench
speed $c$ increases towards the linear invasion speed, the absolute spectrum stabilizes with the
same rate at which eigenvalues accumulate onto it allowing us to rigorously establish spectrally
stability of the front in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The presence of unstable absolute spectrum poses
a technical challenge as spatial eigenvalues along the intermediate state no longer admit a hyperbolic
splitting and standard tools such as exponential dichotomies are unavailable. Instead, we projectivize
the linear flow, and use Riemann surface unfolding in combination with a superposition principle
to study the evolution of subspaces as solutions to the associated matrix Riccati differential
equation on the Grassmannian manifold. Eigenvalues can then be identified as the roots of the meromorphic
Riccati-Evans function, and can be located using winding number and parity arguments.
