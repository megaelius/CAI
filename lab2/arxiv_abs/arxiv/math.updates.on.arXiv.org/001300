The main goal of this work is to clarify and quantify, by means of mathematical analysis, the role
of structural viscoelasticity in the biomechanical response of deformable porous media with incompressible
constituents to sudden changes in external applied loads. Models of deformable porous media with
incompressible constituents are often utilized to describe the behavior of biological tissues,
such as cartilages, bones and engineered tissue scaffolds, where viscoelastic properties may
change with age, disease or by design. Here, for the first time, we show that the fluid velocity within
the medium could increase tremendously, even up to infinity, should the external applied load experience
sudden changes in time and the structural viscoelasticity be too small. In particular, we consider
a one-dimensional poro-visco-elastic model for which we derive explicit solutions in the cases
where the external applied load is characterized by a step pulse or a trapezoidal pulse in time. By
means of dimensional analysis, we identify some dimensionless parameters that can aid the design
of structural properties and/or experimental conditions as to ensure that the fluid velocity within
the medium remains bounded below a certain given threshold, thereby preventing potential tissue
damage. The application to confined compression tests for biological tissues is discussed in detail.
Interestingly, the loss of viscoelastic tissue properties has been associated with various disease
conditions, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma. Thus, the findings of
this work may be relevant to many applications in biology and medicine.
