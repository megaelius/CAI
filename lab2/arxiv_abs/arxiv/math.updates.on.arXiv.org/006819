Davis and Jedwab (1997) established a great construction theory unifying many previously known
constructions of difference sets, relative difference sets and divisible difference sets. They
introduced the concept of building blocks, which played an important role in the theory. On the other
hand, Polhill (2010) gave a construction of Paley type partial difference sets (conference graphs)
based on a special system of building blocks, called a covering extended building set, and proved
that there exists a Paley type partial difference set in an abelian group of order $9^iv^4$ for any
odd positive integer $v>1$ and any $i=0,1$. His result covers all orders of nonelementary abelian
groups in which Paley type partial difference sets exist. In this paper, we give new constructions
of strongly regular Cayley graphs on abelian groups by extending the theory of building blocks.
The constructions are large generalizations of Polhill's construction. In particular, we show
that for a positive integer $m$ and elementary abelian groups $G_i$, $i=1,2,\ldots,s$, of order
$q_i^4$ such that $2m\,|\,q_i+1$, there exists a decomposition of the complete graph on the abelian
group $G=G_1\times G_2\times \cdots\times G_s$ by strongly regular Cayley graphs with negative
Latin square type parameters $(u^2,c(u+1),- u+c^2+3 c,c^2+ c)$, where $u=q_1^2q_2^2\cdots q_s^2$
and $c=(u-1)/m$. Such strongly regular decompositions were previously known only when $m=2$ or
$G$ is a $p$-group. Moreover, we find one more new infinite family of decompositions of the complete
graphs by Latin square type strongly regular Cayley graphs. Thus, we obtain many strongly regular
graphs with new parameters.
