In this paper, we study two PDEs which generalize the urban crime model proposed by M. Short et al.
Our modifications are made under the assumption of spatial heterogeneity of the near-repeat victimization
effect and the dispersal strategy of criminal agents. We investigate pattern formations of the
reaction-advection-diffusion systems over multi-imensional bounded domains subject to homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the positive homogeneous steady state loses its stability
as the intrinsic near--repeat victimization rate $\epsilon$ shrinks. Then we obtain nonhomogeneous
positive stationary solutions by bifurcation analysis. Moreover, we find the wavemode selection
mechanism by rigorous stability analysis of the nontrivial patterns, which shows that the only
stable pattern must be the wavemode whose wavenumber is a positive integer that maximizes the bifurcation
value. Based on this wavemode selection mechanism, we will be able to precisely predict the formation
of stable aggregates of the house attractiveness and criminal populations density, at least when
the diffusion rate $\epsilon$ is around the principal bifurcation value. Our theoretical results
also suggest that large domains support more stable aggregates than small domains. Finally, we
perform extensive numerical simulations over 1D intervals and 2D squares to verify our theoretical
findings. Our numerics also include some interesting phenomena such as the merging of two interior
spikes and the emerging of new spikes, etc. These spiky solutions can model the empirical observed
aggregation phenomenon in urban criminal activities.
