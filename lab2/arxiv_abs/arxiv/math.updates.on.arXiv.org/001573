Bernoulli convolutions are certain measures on the unit interval depending on a parameter $\beta$
between 1 and 2. In spite of their simple definition, they are not yet well understood. We study their
two-dimensional density which exists by a theorem of Solomyak. To each Bernoulli convolution,
there is an interval $D$ called the overlap region, and a map which assigns two values to each point
of $D$ and one value to all other points of $[0,1].$ There are two types of finite orbits of these multivalued
maps which correspond to zeros and potential singularities of the density, respectively. Orbits
which do not meet $D$ belong to an ordinary map called $\beta$-transformation and exist for all $\beta>1.6182.$
They were studied by Erd\"os, J\'oo, Komornik, Sidorov, de Vries and others as points with unique
addresses, and by Jordan, Shmerkin and Solomyak as points with maximal local dimension. In the two-dimensional
view, these orbits form address curves related to the Milnor-Thurston itineraries in one-dimensional
dynamics. The curves depend smoothly on the parameter and represent quantiles of all corresponding
Bernoulli convolutions. Finite orbits which intersect $D$ have a network-like structure and can
exist only at Perron parameters $\beta.$ Their points are intersections of extended address curves,
and can have finite or countable number of addresses, as found by Sidorov. For an uncountable number
of parameters, the central point $\frac12$ has only two addresses. The intersection of periodic
address curves can lead to singularities of the measures. We give examples which are not Pisot or
Salem parameters. It seems that all singularities of Bernoulli convolutions are related to network-like
orbits. The paper is self-contained and includes many illustrations.
