In this paper, we study isogeny graphs of supersingular elliptic curves. Supersingular isogeny
graphs were introduced as a hard problem into cryptography by Charles, Goren, and Lauter for the
construction of cryptographic hash functions [CGL06]. These are large expander graphs, and the
hard problem is to find an efficient algorithm for routing, or path-finding, between two vertices
of the graph. We consider four aspects of supersingular isogeny graphs, study each thoroughly and,
where appropriate, discuss how they relate to one another. First, we consider two related graphs
that help us understand the structure: the `spine' $\mathcal{S}$, which is the subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_\ell(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$
given by the $j$-invariants in $\mathbb{F}_p$, and the graph $\mathcal{G}_\ell(\mathbb{F}_p)$,
in which both curves and isogenies must be defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We show how to pass from the
latter to the former. The graph $\mathcal{S}$ is relevant for cryptanalysis because routing between
vertices in $\mathbb{F}_p$ is easier than in the full isogeny graph. The $\mathbb{F}_p$-vertices
are typically assumed to be randomly distributed in the graph, which is far from true. We provide
an analysis of the distances of connected components of $\mathcal{S}$. Next, we study the involution
on $\mathcal{G}_\ell(\overline{\mathbb{F}_p})$ that is given by the Frobenius of $\mathbb{F}_p$
and give heuristics on how often shortest paths between two conjugate $j$-invariants are preserved
by this involution (mirror paths). We also study the related question of what proportion of conjugate
$j$-invariants are $\ell$-isogenous for $\ell = 2,3$. We conclude with experimental data on the
diameters of supersingular isogeny graphs when $\ell = 2$ and compare this with previous results
on diameters of LPS graphs and random Ramanujan graphs.
