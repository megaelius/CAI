We consider the stochastic variational inequality problem in which the map is expectation- valued
in a component-wise sense. Much of the available convergence theory and rate statements for stochastic
approximation schemes is limited to monotone maps. However, non-monotone stochastic variational
inequality problems are not uncommon and are seen to arise from product pricing, fractional optimization
problems, and subclasses of economic equilibrium problems. Mo- tivated by the need to address a
broader class of maps, we make the following contributions: (i) We present an extragradient-based
stochastic approximation scheme and prove that the iterates converge to a solution of the original
problem under either pseudomonotonicity requirements or a suitably defined acute angle condition.
Such statements are shown to be generalizable to the stochastic mirror-prox framework; (ii) Under
strong pseudomonotonicity, we derive the op- timal initial steplength and show that the mean-squared
error in the solution iterates produced by the extragradient SA scheme converges at the optimal
rate of O(1/K) , statements that were K hitherto unavailable in this regime. Notably this rate statement
relies on deriving an {\epsilon}-infimum of a discontinuous nonconvex function. Similar rates
are derived for mirror-prox generalizations and can accommodate monotone SVIs under a weak-sharpness
requirement. Finally, both the asymptotics and the empirical rates of the schemes are studied on
a set of variational problems where it is seen that the theoretically specified initial steplength
leads to significant performance benefits.
