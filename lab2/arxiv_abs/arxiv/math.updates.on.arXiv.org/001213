We provide a unified approach, via incidence algebras, to the classification of several important
types of representations: distributive, thin, with finitely many orbits, or with finitely many
invariant subspaces, as well as of several types of algebras such as semidistributive, or with finitely
many ideals, or locally hereditary. The key tool is the introduction of a deformation theory of posets
and incidence algebras. We show that these deformations are precisely the locally hereditary semidistributive
algebras, and that they are classified in terms of the cohomology of the simplicial realization
of the poset. A series of applications is derived. First, we show that incidence algebras are exactly
the acyclic algebras admitting a faithful distributive module, equivalently, algebras admitting
a faithful thin representation. Second, we give a complete classification of all thin/distributive
representations of incidence algebras. Furthermore, we extend this and provide an algorithm to
completely classify thin representations over any finite dimensional algebra A, for every such
representation, its annihilator I together with a 1-cohomology class on a finite poset obtained
from the lattice of ideals of A/I, provides a complete invariant. Consequently, we obtain the following
"generic classification": we show that any thin representation of any algebra, and any distributive
representation of an acyclic algebra can be presented, by choosing suitable bases and after canceling
the annihilator, as the defining representation of an incidence algebra. Other applications include
consequences on the structure of representation and Grothendieck rings of incidence algebras,
on graphs and incidence matrices, and an answer to the no gap conjecture of Bongartz and Ringel, in
a particular case. Several results in literature are also re-derived, and several questions are
formulated at the end.
