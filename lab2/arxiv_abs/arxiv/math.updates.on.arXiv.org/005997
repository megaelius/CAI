We put forward a new algorithmic solution to the massive unsourced random access (URA) problem,
by leveraging the rich spatial dimensionality offered by large-scale antenna arrays. This paper
makes an observation that spatial signature is key to URA in massive connectivity setups. The proposed
scheme relies on a slotted transmission framework but eliminates completely the need for concatenated
coding that was introduced in the context of the coupled compressive sensing (CCS) paradigm. Indeed,
all existing works on CCS-based URA rely on an inner/outer tree-based encoder/decoder to stitch
the slot-wise recovered sequences. This paper takes a different path by harnessing the nature-provided
correlations between the slot-wise reconstructed channels of each user in order to put together
its decoded sequences. The required slot-wise channel estimates and decoded sequences are first
obtained through the powerful hybrid generalized approximate message passing (HyGAMP) algorithm
which systematically accommodates the multiantenna-induced group sparsity. Then, a channel
correlation-aware clustering framework based on the expectation-maximization (EM) concept
is used together with the Hungarian algorithm to find the slot-wise optimal assignment matrices
by enforcing two clustering constraints that are very specific to the problem at hand. Stitching
is then readily accomplished by associating the decoded sequences to their respective users according
to the ensuing assignment matrices. Exhaustive computer simulations reveal that the proposed
scheme outperforms by far the only known work from the open literature. More precisely, it will be
seen that our scheme can accommodate a very large number of active users with much higher total spectral
efficiency while using a remarkably smaller number of receive antennas and achieving a low decoding
error probability.
