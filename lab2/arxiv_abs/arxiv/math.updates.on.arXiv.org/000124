Mathieu ordinary differential equation is of Fuchsian types with the two regular and one irregular
singularities. In contrast, Heun equation of Fuchsian types has the three regular and one irregular
singularities. Heun equation has the four kind of confluent forms: (1) Confluent Heun (two regular
and one irregular singularities), (2) Doubly confluent Heun (two irregular singularities), (3)
Biconfluent Heun (one regular and one irregular singularities), (4) Triconfluent Heun equations
(one regular and one irregular singularities). Mathieu equation in algebraic forms is also derived
from the Confluent Heun equation by changing all coefficients. [see (67) in arXiv:1303.0876 ] In
this paper I will apply three term recurrence formula by Choun [ arXiv:1303.0806 ] to the power series
expansion in closed forms of Mathieu function (infinite series and polynomial) and its integral
forms including all higher terms of A_n's. One interesting observation resulting from the calculations
is the fact that a Modified Bessel function recurs in each of sub-integral forms: the first sub-integral
form contains zero term of A_n's, the second one contains one term of A_n's, the third one contains
two terms of A_n's, etc. Section 5 contains two additional examples of Mathieu function. This paper
is 5th out of 10 in series "Special functions and three term recurrence formula (3TRF)". See section
6 for all the papers in the series. Previous paper in series deals with asymptotic behavior of Heun
function and its integral formalism by Choun [ arXiv:1303.0876 ]. The next paper in the series describes
the power series expansion in closed forms of Lame function and its integral forms in the algebraic
form by Choun [ arXiv:1303.0873 ].
