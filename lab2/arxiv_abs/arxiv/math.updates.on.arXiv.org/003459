Decision rules offer a rich and tractable framework for solving certain classes of multistage adaptive
optimization problems. Recent literature has shown the promise of using linear and nonlinear decision
rules in which wait-and-see decisions are represented as functions, whose parameters are decision
variables to be optimized, of the underlying uncertain parameters. Despite this growing success,
solving real-world stochastic optimization problems can become computationally prohibitive
when using nonlinear decision rules, and in some cases, linear ones. Consequently, decision rules
that offer a competitive trade-off between solution quality and computational time become more
attractive. Whereas the extant research has always used homogeneous decision rules, the major
contribution of this paper is a computational exploration of hybrid decision rules. We first verify
empirically that having higher uncertainty resolution or more linear pieces in early stages is
more significant than having it in late stages in terms of solution quality. Then we conduct a comprehensive
computational study for non-increasing (i.e., higher uncertainty resolution in early stages)
and non-decreasing (i.e., higher uncertainty resolution in late stages) hybrid decision rules
to illustrate the trade-off between solution quality and computational cost. We also demonstrate
a case where a linear decision rule is superior to a piecewise-linear decision rule within a simulator
environment, which supports the need to assess the quality of decision rules obtained from a look-ahead
model within a simulator rather than just using the look-ahead model's objective function value.
