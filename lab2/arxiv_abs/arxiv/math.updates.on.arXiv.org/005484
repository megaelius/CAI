This paper presents a new approach to the detection of discontinuities in the n-th derivative of
observational data. This is achieved by performing two polynomial approximations at each interstitial
point. The polynomials are coupled by constraining their coefficients to ensure continuity of
the model up to the (n-1)-th derivative; while yielding an estimate for the discontinuity of the
n-th derivative. The coefficients of the polynomials correspond directly to the derivatives of
the approximations at the interstitial points through the prudent selection of a common coordinate
system. The approximation residual and extrapolation errors are investigated as measures for
detecting discontinuity. This is necessary since discrete observations of continuous systems
are discontinuous at every point. It is proven, using matrix algebra, that positive extrema in the
combined approximation-extrapolation error correspond exactly to extrema in the difference
of the Taylor coefficients. This provides a relative measure for the severity of the discontinuity
in the observational data. The matrix algebraic derivations are provided for all aspects of the
methods presented here; this includes a solution for the covariance propagation through the computation.
The performance of the method is verified with a Monte Carlo simulation using synthetic piecewise
polynomial data with known discontinuities. It is also demonstrated that the discontinuities
are suitable as knots for B-spline modelling of data. For completeness, the results of applying
the method to sensor data acquired during the monitoring of heavy machinery are presented.
