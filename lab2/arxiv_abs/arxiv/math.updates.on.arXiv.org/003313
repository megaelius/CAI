In the canonical formalism for the free electromagnetic field a solution to Maxwell's equations
is customarily identified with its initial gauge potential (in Coulomb gauge) and initial electric
field, which together determine a point in phase space. The solutions to Maxwell's equations, all
of whose plane waves in their plane wave expansions have positive helicity, thereby determine a
subspace of phase space. We will show that this subspace consists of initial gauge potentials which
lie in the positive spectral subspace of the operator curl together with initial electric fields
conjugate to such potentials. Similarly for negative helicity. Helicity is thereby characterized
by the spectral subspaces of curl in configuration space. A gauge potential on three-space has a
Poisson extension to a four dimensional Euclidean half space, defined as the solution to the Maxwell-Poisson
equation whose initial data is the given gauge potential. We will show that the extension is anti-self
dual if and only if the gauge potential lies in the positive spectral subspace of curl. Similarly
for self dual extension and negative spectral subspace. Helicity is thereby characterized for
a normalizable electromagnetic field by the canonical formalism and (anti-)self duality. For
a non-abelian gauge field on Minkowski space a plane wave expansion is not gauge invariant. Nor is
the notion of positive spectral subspace of curl. But if one replaces the Maxwell-Poisson equation
by the Yang-Mills-Poisson equation then (anti-)self duality on the Euclidean side induces a decomposition
of (now non-linear) configuration space similar to that in the electromagnetic case. The strong
analogy suggests a gauge invariant definition of helicity for non-abelian gauge fields. We will
provide further support for this view.
