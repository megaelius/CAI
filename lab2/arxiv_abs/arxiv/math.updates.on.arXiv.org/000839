In the last 20 years a whole hierarchy of notions of tractability was proposed and analyzed by several
authors. These notions are used to classify the computational hardness of continuous numerical
problems $S=(S_d)_{d\in\mathbb{N}}$ in terms of the behavior of their information complexity
$n(\epsilon,S_d)$ as a function of the accuracy $\epsilon$ and the dimension $d$. By now a lot of
effort was spend on either proving quantitative positive results (such as, e.g., the concrete dependence
on $\epsilon$ and $d$ within the well-established framework of polynomial tractability), or on
qualitative negative results (which, e.g., state that a given problem suffers from the so-called
curse of dimensionality). Although several weaker types of tractability were introduced recently,
the theory of information-based complexity still lacks a notion which allows to quantify the exact
(sub-/super-)exponential dependence of $n(\epsilon,S_d)$ on both parameters $\epsilon$ and
$d$. In this paper we present the notion of $(s,t)$-weak tractability which attempts to fill this
gap. Within this new framework the parameters $s$ and $t$ are used to quantitatively refine the huge
class of polynomially intractable problems. For linear, compact operators between Hilbert spaces
we provide characterizations of $(s,t)$-weak tractability w.r.t. the worst case setting in terms
of singular values. In addition, our new notion is illustrated by classical examples which recently
attracted some attention. In detail, we study approximation problems between periodic Sobolev
spaces and integration problems for classes of smooth functions. Keywords: Information-based
