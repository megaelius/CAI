This is the first in a series of three notes on an investigation into core regular double Stone algebras,
CRDSA, and are meant to be read in order. In [2] many useful results regarding the center and core of
a CRDSA that indicate the "nearly Boolean" nature of CRDSA and we extend that concept here. These
notes were born out of a model of network security where individual nodes are considered to be in one
and only one of 3 states, e.g. ternary set partitions. Applications of these results are being explored,
results of at least one of which will be published at a later date. Let J be any non-empty set of network
nodes, not necessarily finite. We denote the node set bounded distributive lattice through the
pairwise disjoint subsets of J with the well known binary operations of ternary set partitions and
note J = 1 is our minimal case. We then show the resultant bounded distributive lattice is isomorphic
to direct products of the 3 element chain, C_3. We then derive that every CRDSA is a subdirect product
of C_3, similarly to Boolean algebras and C_2. We use these results along with a few known results
to show the main result, namely Every Boolean algebra is the center of some core regular double Stone
algebra, CRDSA. We then use that result to characterize all finite core regular double Stone Algebras,
namely A CRDSA A is a subalgebra of C_3^J for some finite J if and only if it is isomorphic to C_3^K for
some K less than or equal to J. Perhaps more importantly, we note that we have shown that any finite
CRDSA is isomorphic to C_3^J for some finite J, similarly as for Boolean algebras and C_2. Lastly,
we show that C_3 is primal, which implies that the variety generated by it is categorically equivalent
to the category of Stone spaces and hence the category of Boolean algebras. The following two notes
establish a duality further exhibiting the "nearly Boolean" nature of CRDSA.
