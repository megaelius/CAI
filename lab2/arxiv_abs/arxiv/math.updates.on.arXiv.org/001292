Let $(A,\Delta)$ be a weak multiplier Hopf algebra. It is a pair of a non-degenerate algebra $A$,
with or without identity, and a coproduct $\Delta$ on $A$, satisfying certain properties. The main
difference with multiplier Hopf algebras is that now, the canonical maps $T_1$ and $T_2$ on $A\otimes
A$, defined by $$T_1(a\otimes b)=\Delta(a)(1\otimes b) \qquad\quad\text{and}\qquad\quad
T_2(c\otimes a)=(c\otimes 1)\Delta(a),$$ are no longer assumed to be bijective. Also recall that
a weak multiplier Hopf algebra is called regular if its antipode is a bijective map from $A$ to itself.
In this paper, we introduce and study the notion of integrals on such regular weak multiplier Hopf
algebras. A left integral is a non-zero linear functional on $A$ that is left invariant (in an appropriate
sense). Similarly for a right integral. For a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra $(A,\Delta)$
with (sufficiently many) integrals, we construct the dual $(\widehat A,\widehat\Delta)$. It
is again a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra with (sufficiently many) integrals. This duality
extends the known duality of finite-dimensional weak Hopf algebras to this more general case. It
also extends the duality of multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals, the so-called algebraic quantum
groups. For this reason, we will sometimes call a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra with enough
integrals an algebraic quantum groupoid. We discuss the relation of our work with the work on duality
for algebraic quantum groupoids by Timmermann. We also illustrate this duality with a particular
example in a separate paper. In this paper, we only mention the main definitions and results for this
example. However, we do consider the two natural weak multiplier Hopf algebras associated with
a groupoid in detail and show that they are dual to each other in the sense of the above duality.
