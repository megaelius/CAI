We examine a passive scalar diffusing in time-varying flows which are induced by a periodically
oscillating wall in a Newtonian fluid between two infinite parallel plates as well as in an infinitely
long duct. These shear flows yield the generalized Ferry waves which are exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations. First, we calculate the second Aris moment for all time, and its long time limiting effective
diffusivity as a function of the geometrical parameters, frequency, viscosity, and diffusivity.
We show that the viscous dominated limit results in a linear shear layer for which the effective diffusivity
is bounded with upper bound $\kappa(1+A^2/(2L^2))$, where $\kappa$ is the tracer diffusivity,
$A$ is the amplitude of oscillation, and $L$ is the gap thickness. Alternatively, we show that for
finite viscosities the enhanced diffusion is unbounded, diverging in the high frequency limit.
Physical arguments are given to explain these striking differences. Asymptotics for the high frequency
behavior as well as the low viscosity limit are computed. Study of the exact formula shows that a maximum
exists as a function of the viscosity, suggesting a possible optimal temperature for mixing in this
geometry. Physical experiments are performed in water using Particle Tracking Velocimetry to
quantitatively measure the fluid flow. Using fluorescein dye as the passive tracer, we document
that the theory is quantitatively accurate. Further, we show that the scalar skewness is zero for
linear shear at all times, whereas for the nonlinear Ferry wave, using Monte-Carlo simulations,
we show the skewness sign (as well as front versus back loaded distributions) can be controlled through
the phase of the oscillating wall. Lastly, short time skewness asymptotics are computed for the
Ferry wave and compared to the Monte-Carlo simulations.
