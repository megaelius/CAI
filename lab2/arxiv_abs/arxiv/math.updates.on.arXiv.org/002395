Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic system that generates an information-theoretically
secure key shared by two legitimate parties. QKD consists of two parts: quantum and classical. The
latter is referred to as classical post-processing (CPP). Information reconciliation is a part
of CPP in which parties are given correlated variables and attempt to eliminate the discrepancies
between them while disclosing a minimum amount of information. The elegant reconciliation protocol
known as \emph{Cascade} was developed specifically for QKD in 1992 and has become the de-facto standard
for all QKD implementations. However, the protocol is highly interactive. Thus, other protocols
based on linear block codes such as Hamming codes, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and polar
codes have been researched. In particular, reconciliation using LDPC codes has been mainly studied
because of its outstanding performance. Nevertheless, with small block size, the bit error rate
performance of polar codes under successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding with a cyclic redundancy
check (CRC) is comparable to state-of-the-art turbo and LDPC codes. In this study, we demonstrate
the use of polar codes to improve the performance of information reconciliation in a QKD system with
small block size. The best decoder for polar codes, a CRC-aided SCL decoder, requires CRC-precoded
messages. However, messages that are sifted keys in QKD are obtained arbitrarily as a result of a
characteristic of the QKD protocol and cannot be CRC-precoded. We propose a method that allows arbitrarily
obtained sifted keys to be CRC precoded by introducing a virtual string. Thus the best decoder can
be used for reconciliation using polar codes and improves the efficiency of the protocol.
