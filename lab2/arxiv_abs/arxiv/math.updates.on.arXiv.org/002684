In this paper, we study the performance of affine policies for two-stage adjustable robust optimization
problem with uncertain right hand side belonging to a budgeted uncertainty set. This is an important
class of uncertainty sets widely used in practice where we can specify a budget on the adversarial
deviations of the uncertain parameters from the nominal values to adjust the level of conservatism.
The two-stage adjustable robust optimization problem is hard to approximate within a factor better
than $\Omega \left( \frac{\log n}{\log \log n} \right)$ even for budget of uncertainty sets where
$n$ is the number of decision variables. Affine policies, where the second-stage decisions are
constrained to be an affine function of the uncertain parameters, provide a tractable approximation
for the problem and exhibit good empirical performance. We show that affine policies give an $O\left(
\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)$-approximation for the two-stage adjustable robust problem
for this class of uncertainty sets. This matches the hardness of approximation and therefore, surprisingly
affine policies provide an optimal approximation for the problem (up to some constant factor).
We also show strong theoretical performance bounds for affine policy for significantly more general
class of intersection of budgeted sets including disjoint constrained budgeted sets, permutation
invariant sets and general intersection of budgeted sets. Our analysis relies on showing the existence
of a near-optimal feasible affine policy that satisfies certain nice structural properties. Based
on these structural properties, we also present an alternate algorithm to compute near-optimal
affine solution that is significantly faster than computing the optimal affine policy by solving
a large linear program.
