Let U be a smooth variety over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero and f : U -->
A^1 a regular function, and write X = Crit(f), as a closed subscheme of U. The motivic vanishing cycle
MF_{U,f}^\phi\ is an element of the \mu-equivariant motivic Grothendieck ring M^\mu_X defined
by Denef and Loeser math.AG/0006050 and Looijenga math.AG/0006220 , and used in Kontsevich and
Soibelman's theory of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants, arXiv:0811.2435 . We prove three
main results: (a) MF_{U,f}^\phi\ depends only on the third-order thickenings U^3,f^3 of U,f. (b)
If V is another smooth variety, g : V --> A^1 is regular, Y = Crit(g), and \Phi\ : U --> V is an embedding
with f = g o \Phi\ and \Phi|_X : X --> Y an isomorphism, then \Phi|_X^*(MF_{V,g}^\phi) equals MF_{U,f}^\phi\
"twisted" by a motive naturally associated to a principal Z_2-bundle defined using \Phi, where
now we work in a certain quotient ring \bar M^\mu_X of M^\mu_X. (c) If (X,s) is an oriented algebraic
d-critical locus in the sense of Joyce arXiv:1304.4508 , there is a natural motive MF_{X,s} in \bar
M^\mu_X, such that if (X,s) is locally modelled on Crit(f : U --> A^1), then MF_{X,s} is locally
modelled on MF_{U,f}^\phi. Using results of Pantev, Toen, Vezzosi and Vaquie arXiv:1111.3209
, these imply the existence of natural motives on moduli schemes of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau
3-fold equipped with "orientation data", as required in Kontsevich and Soibelman's motivic Donaldson-Thomas
theory arXiv:0811.2435 , and on intersections of spin Lagrangians in an algebraic symplectic manifold.
This paper is an analogue for motives of results on perverse sheaves of vanishing cycles proved by
Brav, Bussi, Dupont, Joyce and Szendroi in arXiv:1211.3259 .
