The modern state of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) is discussed. PEP can be considered from
two viewpoints. On the one hand, it asserts that particles with half-integer spin (fermions) are
described by antisymmetric wave functions, and particles with integer spin (bosons) are described
by symmetric wave functions. This is the so-called spin-statistics connection (SSC). As we will
discuss, the physical reasons why SSC exists are still unknown. On the other hand, according to PEP,
the permutation symmetry of the total wave functions can be only of two types: symmetric or antisymmetric,
both belong to one-dimensional representations of the permutation group, all other types of permutation
symmetry are forbidden; whereas the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation may have any permutation
symmetry. It is demonstrated that the proof in some widespread textbooks on quantum mechanics that
only symmetric and antisymmetric states (one-dimensional representations of the permutation
group) can exist is wrong. However, the scenarios, in which an arbitrary permutation symmetry (degenerate
permutation states) is permitted lead to contradictions with the concepts of particle identity
and their independence. Thus, the existence in our nature particles only in nondegenerate permutation
states (symmetric and antisymmetric) is not accidental and so-called symmetrization postulate
may not be considered as a postulate, since all other symmetry options for the total wave function
may not be realized. From this an important conclusion follows: we may not expect that in future some
unknown elementary particles can be discovered that are not fermions or bosons.
