This work is a contribution to the classification of Teichm\"uller curves in the moduli space $\M_2$
of Riemann surfaces of genus 2. While the classification of primitive Teichm\"uller curves in $\M_2$
is complete, the classification of the imprimitive curves, which is related to branched torus covers
and square-tiled surfaces, remains open. Conjecturally, the classification is completed as follows.
Let $W_{d^2}[n] \subset \M_2$ be the 1-dimensional subvariety consisting of those $X \in \M_2$
that admit a primitive degree $d$ holomorphic map $\pi: X \to E$ to an elliptic curve $E$, branched
over torsion points of order $n$. It is known that every imprimitive Teichm\"uller curve in $\M_2$
is a component of some $W_{d^2}[n]$. The {\em parity conjecture} states that (with minor exceptions)
$W_{d^2}[n]$ has two components when $n$ is odd, and one when $n$ is even. In particular, the number
of components of $W_{d^2}[n]$ does not depend on $d$. In this work we establish the parity conjecture
in the following three cases: (1) for all $n$ when $d=2,3,4,5$; (2) when $d$ and $n$ are prime and $n
> (d^3-d)/4$; and (3) when $d$ is prime and $n > C_d$, where $C_d$ is an implicit constant that depends
on $d$. In the course of the proof we will see that the modular curve $X(d) = \overline{\Hyp \big/ \Gamma(d)}$
is itself a square-tiled surface equipped with a natural action of $\SLZ$. The parity conjecture
is equivalent to the classification of the finite orbits of this action. It is also closely related
to the following {\em illumination conjecture}: light sources at the cusps of the modular curve
illuminate all of $X(d)$, except possibly some vertices of the square-tiling. Our results show
that the illumination conjecture is true for $d \le 5$.
