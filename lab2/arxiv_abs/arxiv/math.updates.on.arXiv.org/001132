The purpose of this paper is to study the mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary value problem for the
semilinear Darcy-Forchheimer-Brinkman system in $L_p$-based Besov spaces on a bounded Lipschitz
domain in ${\mathbb R}^3$, with $p$ in a neighborhood of $2$. This system is obtained by adding the
semilinear term $|{\bf u}|{\bf u}$ to the linear Brinkman equation. {First, we provide some results
about} equivalence between the Gagliardo and non-tangential traces, as well as between the weak
canonical conormal derivatives and the non-tangential conormal derivatives. Various mapping
and invertibility properties of some integral operators of potential theory for the linear Brinkman
system, and well posedness results for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems in $L_p$-based Besov
spaces on bounded Lipschitz domains in ${\mathbb R}^n$ ($n\geq 3$) are also presented. Then, employing
integral potential operators, we show the well-posedness in $L_2$-based Sobolev spaces for the
mixed problem of Dirichlet-Neumann type for the linear Brinkman system on a bounded Lipschitz domain
in ${\mathbb R}^n$ $(n\geq 3)$. Further, by using some stability results of Fredholm and invertibility
properties and exploring invertibility of the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, we
extend the well-posedness property to some $L_p$-based Sobolev spaces. Next we use the well-posedness
result in the linear case combined with a fixed point theorem in order to show the existence and uniqueness
for a mixed boundary value problem of Dirichlet and Neumann type for the semilinear Darcy-Forchheimer-Brinkman
system in $L_p$-based Besov spaces, with $p\in (2-\varepsilon ,2+\varepsilon)$ and some parameter
$\varepsilon >0$.
