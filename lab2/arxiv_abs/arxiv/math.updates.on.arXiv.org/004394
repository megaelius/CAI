Let $A$ be an $AH$ algebra $A=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}(A_{n}=\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}\limits^{t_{n}}P_{n,i}M_{[n,i]}(C(X_{n,i}))P_{n,i},
\phi_{n,m})$, where $X_{n,i}$ are compact metric spaces, $t_{n}$ and $[n,i]$ are positive integers,
and $P_{n,i}\in M_{[n,i]}(C(X_{n,i}))$ are projections. Suppose that $A$ has the ideal property:
each closed two-sided ideal of $A$ is generated by the projections inside the ideal, as a closed two
sided ideal. In this article, we will classify all $AH$ algebras with ideal property of no dimension
growth---that is, $sup_{n,i}dim(X_{n,i})<+\infty$. This result generalizes and unifies the
classification of $AH$ algebras of real rank zero in [EG] and [DG] and the classification of simple
$AH$ algebras in [G5] and [EGL1]. This completes one of two important possible generalizations
of [EGL1] suggested in the introduction of [EGL1]. The invariants for the classification include
the scaled ordered total $K$-group $(\underline{K}(A), \underline{K}(A)_{+},\Sigma A)$ (as
already used in real rank zero case in [DG]), for each $[p]\in\Sigma A$, the tracial state space $T(pAp)$
of cut down algebra $pAp$ with a certain compatibility, (which is used by [Stev] and [Ji-Jiang] for
$AI$ algebras with the ideal property), and a new ingredient, the invariant $U(pAp)/\overline{DU(pAp)}$
with a certain compatibility condition, where $\overline{DU(pAp)}$ is the closure of commutator
subgroup $DU(pAp)$ of the unitary group $U(pAp)$ of the cut down algebra $pAp$. In [GJL] a counterexample
is presented to show that this new ingredient must be included in the invariant. The discovery of
this new invariant is analogous to that of the order structure on the total K-theory when one advances
from the classification of simple real rank zero $C^*$-algebras to that of non simple real rank zero
$C^*$-algebras in [G2], [Ei], [DL] and [DG] (see Introduction below).
