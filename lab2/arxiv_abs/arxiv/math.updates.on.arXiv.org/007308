The fluid-gravity correspondence documents a precise mathematical map between a class of dynamical
spacetime solutions of the Einstein field equations of gravity and the dynamics of its corresponding
dual fluid flows governed by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations of hydrodynamics. This striking
connection has been explored in several dynamics-based approaches and has surfaced in various
forms over the past four decades. In a recent construction, it has been shown that the manifold properties
of geometric duals are in fact intimately connected to the dynamics of incompressible fluids, thus
bypassing the conventional on-shell standpoints. Following such a prescription, we construct
the geometrical description that effectively captures the dynamics of an incompressible NS fluid
with respect to a uniformly rotating frame. We propose the gravitational dual(s) described by bulk
metric(s) in $(p+2)$-dimensions such that the equations of parallel transport of an appropriately
defined bulk velocity vector field when projected onto an induced timelike hypersurface require
that the incompressible NS equation of a fluid relative to a uniformly rotating frame be satisfied
at the relevant perturbative order in $(p+1)$-dimensions. We argue that free fluid flows on manifold(s)
described by the proposed metric(s) can be effectively considered as an equivalent theory of non-relativistic
viscous fluid dynamics with respect to (w.r.t) a uniform rotating frame. We also present suggestive
insights as to how space-time rotation parameters encode information pertaining to the inertial
effects in the corresponding fluid dual.
