We prove a general version of Radon's theorem for finite families $\mathcal F$ of sets in zero-, one-
and two-dimensional (pseudo)manifolds and graphs. The only requirement is that for each $\mathcal
G\subseteq\mathcal F$ the intersection $\bigcap\mathcal G$ has bounded number of path-connected
components. As a consequence we obtain Helly's and Tverberg's theorems, fractional and colorful
Helly theorems, existence of weak $\varepsilon$-nets and $(p,q)$-theorems. More precisely,
if $\mathcal F$ is an intersection-closed family in a topological space $X$ and $S\subseteq X$,
we define its convex hull $\text{conv}_{\mathcal F}(S)$ as the smallest set in $\mathcal F$ that
contains $S$. The Radon number $r(\mathcal F)$ is then the smallest integer $r$ such that every set
$S\subseteq X$ of size $r$ can be split into two disjoint subsets with intersecting convex hulls.
For every graph $G$ with $n$ vertices we construct a polynomial $p_G(x)$ satisfying the following
three conditions. 1) If $n=1$, $p_G(x)=1$. 2) If $n\geq 2$, the degree of $p_G(x)$ is at most $2n-3$.
3) If the graph $G$ does not almost-embed into a topological space $X$, and $\mathcal F$ is a finite
and intersection-closed family of sets in $X$, such that each member of $\mathcal F$ has at most $b$
path-connected components, then $r(\mathcal F)\leq p_G(b)$. In particular, if $\mathcal F$ is
a family of sets in $\mathbb R^2$, $r(\mathcal F)\leq r_{K_{3,3}}(b)\leq 16b^6 - 20b^5 + 8b^4 + b^3
- b^2 + b + 1$. The proof further refines the constrained chain map method introduced by Goaoc, Pat\'ak,
Pat\'akov\'a, Tancer and Wagner; and further developed by Pat\'akov\'a. We manage to overcome
the use of hypergraph Ramsey theorem and provide polynomial size bounds.
