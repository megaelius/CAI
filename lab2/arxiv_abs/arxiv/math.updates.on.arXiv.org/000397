For closed subgroups K, G of the extended Morava stabilizer group G_n, with K normal in G, and the Lubin-Tate
spectrum E_n, on which G_n acts, the problem of understanding the homotopy fixed point spectra of
E_n for the actions of K and G is multifaceted. Let E_n^{dhG} be the Devinatz-Hopkins construction
that behaves like continuous homotopy fixed points, and let E_n^{hG}, E_n^{h'G} be the continuous
homotopy fixed points in the settings of profinite G-spectra, continuous G-spectra, respectively.
Then there is (a) the strongly convergent Adams-type spectral sequence (S.S.) of Devinatz with
abutment \pi_*(E_n^{dhG}) and E_2-term the continuous cohomology H^s_c(G/K; \pi_t(E_n^{dhK}));
(b) a descent S.S. abutting to \pi_*(E_n^{h'G}) with E_2-term H^s_c(G/K; \pi_t(E_n^{h'K}));
(c) the iterated continuous homotopy fixed points (E_n^{h'K})^{h'G/K}; (d) equivalences between
E_n^{dhG}, E_n^{h'G}, E_n^{hG}. This rich situation motivates various questions about the existence
of certain constructions and interrelations. We establish some connections between the aforementioned
notions of homotopy fixed points and give various sets of sufficient conditions for the existence
of well-behaved iterated continuous homotopy fixed points in the profinite setting. Our results
yield the following answers to the questions referred to above: (e) we prove that E_n^{hK} is a profinite
G/K-spectrum; (f) this result shows that in the profinite setting (E_n^{hK})^{hG/K} exists; (g)
we show that it is just E_n^{hG}. We complete the story begun by (a)-(g), by proving that (h) there
is a homotopy fixed point S.S. with abutment \pi_*(E_n^{hG}) and E_2-term H^s_c(G/K; \pi_t(E_n^{hK}))
that is isomorphic to the S.S.s of (a), (b). Our proof of (g) possesses a technical simplicity that
is not enjoyed by the corresponding proofs in the settings of Devinatz-Hopkins (where G/K must be
finite) and continuous G-spectra.
