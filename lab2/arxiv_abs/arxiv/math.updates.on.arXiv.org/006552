The complex transverse water proton magnetization subject to diffusion-encoding magnetic field
gradient pulses in a heterogeneous medium such as brain tissue can be modeled by the Bloch-Torrey
partial differential equation. The spatial integral of the solution of this equation in realistic
geometry provides a gold-standard reference model for the diffusion MRI signal arising from different
tissue micro-structures of interest. A closed form representation of this reference diffusion
MRI signal has been derived twenty years ago, called Matrix Formalism that makes explicit the link
between the Laplace eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the biological cell and its diffusion MRI
signal. In addition, once the Laplace eigendecomposition has been computed and saved, the diffusion
MRI signal can be calculated for arbitrary diffusion-encoding sequences and b-values at negligible
additional cost. Up to now, this representation, though mathematically elegant, has not been often
used as a practical model of the diffusion MRI signal, due to the difficulties of calculating the
Laplace eigendecomposition in complicated geometries. In this paper, we present a simulation
framework that we have implemented inside the MATLAB-based diffusion MRI simulator SpinDoctor
that efficiently computes the Matrix Formalism representation for realistic neurons using the
finite elements method. We show the Matrix Formalism representation requires around a few hundred
eigenmodes to match the reference signal computed by solving the Bloch-Torrey equation when the
cell geometry comes from realistic neurons. As expected, the number of required eigenmodes to match
the reference signal increases with smaller diffusion time and higher b-values. We gave the transformation
that links the Laplace eigenfunctions to the eigenfunctions of the Bloch-Torrey operator and computed
the Bloch-Torrey eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.
