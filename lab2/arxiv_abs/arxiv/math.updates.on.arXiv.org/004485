Two novel nonlinear pose (i.e, attitude and position) filters developed directly on the Special
Euclidean Group SE(3)able to guarantee prescribed characteristics of transient and steady-state
performance are proposed. The position error and normalized Euclidean distance of attitude error
are trapped to arbitrarily start within a given large set and converge systematically and asymptotically
to the origin from almost any initial condition. The transient error is guaranteed not to exceed
a prescribed value while the steady-state error is bounded by a predefined small value. The first
pose filter operates based on a set of vectorial measurements coupled with a group of velocity vectors
and requires preliminary pose reconstruction. The second filter, on the contrary, is able to perform
its function using a set of vectorial measurements and a group of velocity vectors directly. Both
proposed filters provide reasonable pose estimates with superior convergence properties while
being able to use measurements obtained from low-cost inertial measurement, landmark measurement,
and velocity measurement units. Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness
of the proposed filters considering large error in initialization and high level of uncertainties
in velocity vectors as well as in the set of vector measurements. Attitude, position, pose estimation,
