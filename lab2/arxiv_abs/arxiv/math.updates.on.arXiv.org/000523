We study the geometry and dynamics of discrete infinite covolume subgroups of higher rank semisimple
Lie groups. We introduce and prove the equivalence of several conditions, capturing "rank one behavior''
of discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie groups. They are direct generalizations of rank one equivalents
to convex cocompactness. We also prove that our notions are equivalent to the notion of Anosov subgroup,
for which we provide a closely related, but simplified and more accessible reformulation, avoiding
the geodesic flow of the group. We show moreover that the Anosov condition can be relaxed further
by requiring only non-uniform unbounded expansion along the (quasi)geodesics in the group. A substantial
part of the paper is devoted to the coarse geometry of these discrete subgroups. A key concept which
emerges from our analysis is that of Morse quasigeodesics in higher rank symmetric spaces, generalizing
the Morse property for quasigeodesics in Gromov hyperbolic spaces. It leads to the notion of Morse
actions of word hyperbolic groups on symmetric spaces,i.e. actions for which the orbit maps are
Morse quasiisometric embeddings, and thus provides a coarse geometric characterization for the
class of subgroups considered in this paper. A basic result is a local-to-global principle for Morse
quasigeodesics and actions. As an application of our techniques we show algorithmic recognizability
of Morse actions and construct Morse "Schottky subgroups'' of higher rank semisimple Lie groups
via arguments not based on Tits' ping-pong. Our argument is purely geometric and proceeds by constructing
equivariant Morse quasiisometric embeddings of trees into higher rank symmetric spaces.
