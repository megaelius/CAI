The paper addresses the exact evaluation of the generalized Stieltjes transform $S_{n}[f]=\int_0^{\infty}
f(x) (\omega+x)^{-n}\mathrm{d}x$ of integral order $n=1,2, 3,\dots$ about $\omega =0$ from which
the asymptotic behavior of $S_{n}[f]$ for small parameters $\omega$ is directly extracted. An
attempt to evaluate the integral by expanding the integrand $(\omega+x)^{-n}$ about $\omega=0$
and then naively integrating the resulting infinite series term by term lead to an infinite series
whose terms are divergent integrals. Assigning values to the divergent integrals, say, by analytic
continuation or by Hadamard's finite part is known to reproduce only some of the correct terms of
the expansion but completely misses out a group of terms. Here we evaluate explicitly the generalized
Stieltjes transform by means of finite-part integration recently introduced in [E.A. Galapon,
{\it Proc. Roy. Soc. A} {\bf 473}, 20160567 (2017)]. It is shown that, when $f(x)$ does not vanish
or has zero of order $m$ at the origin such that $(n-m)\geq 1$, the dominant terms of $S_{n}[f]$ as
$\omega\rightarrow 0$ come from contributions arising from the poles and branch points of the complex
valued function $f(z) (\omega+z)^{-n}$. These dominant terms are precisely the terms missed out
by naive term by term integration. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how finite-part integration
leads to new series representations of special functions by exploiting their known Stieltjes integral
representations. Finally, the application of finite part integration in obtaining asymptotic
expansions of the effective diffusivity in the limit of high Peclet number, the Green-Kubo formula
for the self-diffusion coefficient and the antisymmetric part of the diffusion tensor in the weak
noise limit is discussed.
