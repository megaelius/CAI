Reaping the benefits of the Internet of things (IoT) system is contingent upon developing IoT-specific
security solutions. Conventional security and authentication solutions often fail to meet IoT
security requirements due to the computationally limited and portable nature of IoT objects. In
this paper, an IoT objects authentication framework is proposed. The framework uses device-specific
information, called fingerprints, along with a transfer learning tool to authenticate objects
in the IoT. The framework tracks the effect of changes in the physical environment on fingerprints
and uses unique IoT environmental effects features to detect both cyber and cyber-physical emulation
attacks. The proposed environmental effects estimation framework is proven to improve the detection
rate of attackers without increasing the false positives rate. The proposed framework is also shown
to be able to detect cyber-physical attackers that are capable of replicating the fingerprints
of target objects which conventional methods are unable to detect. A transfer learning approach
is proposed to allow the use of objects with different types and features in the environmental effects
estimation process to enhance the performance of the framework while capturing practical IoT deployments
with diverse object types. Simulation results using real IoT device data show that the proposed
approach can yield a 40% improvement in cyber emulation attacks detection and is able to detect cyber-physical
emulation attacks that conventional methods cannot detect. The results also show that the proposed
framework improves the authentication accuracy while the transfer learning approach yields up
to 70% additional performance gains.
