Consider compact objects --such as neutron star or black hole binaries-- in \emph{full, non-linear}
general relativity. In the case with zero cosmological constant $\Lambda$, the gravitational
radiation emitted by such systems is described by the well established, 50+ year old framework due
to Bondi, Sachs, Penrose and others. However, so far we do not have a satisfactory extension of this
framework to include a \emph{positive} cosmological constant --or, more generally, the dark energy
responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. In particular, we do not yet have an adequate
gauge invariant characterization of gravitational waves in this context. As the next step in extending
the Bondi et al framework to the $\Lambda >0$ case, in this paper we address the following questions:
How do we impose the `no incoming radiation' condition for such isolated systems in a gauge invariant
manner? What is the relevant past boundary where these conditions should be imposed, i.e., what
is the \emph{physically relevant} analog of past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^{-}_{0}$ used in
the $\Lambda=0$ case? What is the symmetry group at this boundary? How is it related to the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs
(BMS) group? What are the associated conserved charges? What happens in the $\Lambda \to 0$ limit?
Do we systematically recover the Bondi-Sachs-Penrose structure at $\mathcal{I}^{-}_{0}$ of
the $\Lambda=0$ theory, or do some differences persist even in the limit? We will find that while
there are many close similarities, there are also some subtle but important differences from the
asymptotically flat case. Interestingly, to analyze these issues one has to combine conceptual
structures and mathematical techniques introduced by Bondi et al with those associated with \emph{quasi-local
horizons}.
