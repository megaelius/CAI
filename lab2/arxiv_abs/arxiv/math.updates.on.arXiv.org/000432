The main theorem of this article is that every countable model of set theory M, including every well-founded
model, is isomorphic to a submodel of its own constructible universe. In other words, there is an
embedding $j:M\to L^M$ that is elementary for quantifier-free assertions. The proof uses universal
digraph combinatorics, including an acyclic version of the countable random digraph, which I call
the countable random Q-graded digraph, and higher analogues arising as uncountable Fraisse limits,
leading to the hypnagogic digraph, a set-homogeneous, class-universal, surreal-numbers-graded
acyclic class digraph, closely connected with the surreal numbers. The proof shows that $L^M$ contains
a submodel that is a universal acyclic digraph of rank $Ord^M$. The method of proof also establishes
that the countable models of set theory are linearly pre-ordered by embeddability: for any two countable
models of set theory, one of them is isomorphic to a submodel of the other. Indeed, they are pre-well-ordered
by embedability in order-type exactly $\omega_1+1$. Specifically, the countable well-founded
models are ordered by embeddability in accordance with the heights of their ordinals; every shorter
model embeds into every taller model; every model of set theory $M$ is universal for all countable
well-founded binary relations of rank at most $Ord^M$; and every ill-founded model of set theory
is universal for all countable acyclic binary relations. Finally, strengthening a classical theorem
of Ressayre, the same proof method shows that if $M$ is any nonstandard model of PA, then every countable
model of set theory---in particular, every model of ZFC---is isomorphic to a submodel of the hereditarily
finite sets $HF^M$ of $M$. Indeed, $HF^M$ is universal for all countable acyclic binary relations.
