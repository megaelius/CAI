Parking functions are a widely studied class of combinatorial objects, with connections to several
branches of mathematics. On the algebraic side, parking functions can be identified with the standard
monomials of $M_n$, a certain monomial ideal in the polynomial ring $S = {\mathbb K}[x_1, \dots,
x_n]$ where a set of generators are indexed by the nonempty subsets of $[n] = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Motivated
by constructions from the theory of chip-firing on graphs we study generalizations of parking functions
determined by $M^{(k)}_n$, a subideal of $M_n$ obtained by allowing only generators corresponding
to subsets of $[n]$ of size at most $k$. For each $k$ the set of standard monomials of $M^{(k)}_n$,
denoted $\text{stan}_n^k$, contains the usual parking functions and has interesting combinatorial
properties in its own right. For general $k$ we show that elements of $\text{stan}_n^k$ can be recovered
as certain vector-parking functions, which in turn leads to a formula for their count via results
of Yan. The symmetric group $S_n$ naturally acts on the set $\text{stan}_n^k$ and we also obtain
a formula for the number of orbits under this action. For the case of $k = n-2$ we study combinatorial
interpretations of $\text{stan}_n^{n-2}$ and relate them to properties of uprooted trees in terms
of root degree and surface inversions. As a corollary we obtain a combinatorial identity for $n^n$
involving Catalan numbers, reminiscent of a result of Benjamin and Juhnke. For the case of $k = 1$
we observe that the number of elements $\text{stan}_n^1$ is given by the determinant of the reduced
`signless' Laplacian, which provides a weighted count for $|\text{stan}_n^1|$ in terms generalized
spanning trees known as `spanning TU-subgraphs'. Our constructions naturally generalize to arbitrary
graphs and lead to a number of open questions.
