The aim of the present article is to construct quadratically integrable three dimensional systems
in non-vanishing magnetic fields which possess so-called non-subgroup type integrals. The presence
of such integrals means that the system possesses a pair of integrals of motion in involution which
are (at most) quadratic in momenta and whose leading order terms, that are necessarily elements
of the enveloping algebra of the Euclidean algebra, are not quadratic Casimir operators of a chain
of its subalgebras. By imposing in addition that one of the integrals has the leading order term $L_z^2$
we can consider three such commuting pairs: circular parabolic, oblate spheroidal and prolate
spheroidal. We find all possible integrable systems possessing such structure of commuting integrals
and describe their Hamiltonians and their integrals. We show that our assumptions imply the existence
of a first order integral $L_z $, i.e. rotational invariance, of all such systems. As a consequence,
the Hamilton--Jacobi equation of each of these systems with magnetic field separates in the corresponding
coordinate system, as it is known to be the case for all quadratically integrable systems without
magnetic field, and in contrast with the subgroup type, i.e. Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical,
cases, with magnetic fields. We also look for superintegrable systems within the circular parabolic
integrable class. Assuming the additional integral to be first order we demonstrate that only previously
known systems exist. However, for a particular second order ansatz for the sought integral ($L^2+\ldots$)
we find a minimally quadratically superintegrable system. It is not quadratically maximally superintegrable
but appears to possess bounded closed trajectories, hinting at hypothetical higher order superintegrability.
