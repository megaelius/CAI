In the first part of this thesis, we study a Markov chain on $\mathbb{R}_+ \times S$, where $\mathbb{R}_+$
is the non-negative real numbers and $S$ is a finite set, in which when the $\mathbb{R}_+$-coordinate
is large, the $S$-coordinate of the process is approximately Markov with stationary distribution
$\pi_i$ on $S$. Denoting by $\mu_i(x)$ the mean drift of the $\mathbb{R}_+$-coordinate of the process
at $(x,i) \in \mathbb{R}_+ \times S$, we give an exhaustive recurrence classification in the case
where $\sum_{i} \pi_i \mu_i (x) \to 0$, which is the critical regime for the recurrence-transience
phase transition. If $\mu_i(x) \to 0$ for all $i$, it is natural to study the Lamperti case where $\mu_i(x)
= O(1/x)$; in that case the recurrence classification is known, but we prove new results on existence
and non-existence of moments of return times. If $\mu_i (x) \to d_i$ for $d_i \neq 0$ for at least some
$i$, then it is natural to study the generalized Lamperti case where $\mu_i (x) = d_i + O (1/x)$. By
exploiting a transformation which maps the generalized Lamperti case to the Lamperti case, we obtain
a recurrence classification and an existence of moments result for the former. In the second part
of the thesis, for a random walk $S_n$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ we study the asymptotic behaviour of the
associated centre of mass process $G_n = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n S_i$. For lattice distributions we
give conditions for a local limit theorem to hold. We prove that if the increments of the walk have
zero mean and finite second moment, $G_n$ is recurrent if $d=1$ and transient if $d \geq 2$. In the
transient case we show that $G_n$ has diffusive rate of escape. These results extend work of Grill,
who considered simple symmetric random walk. We also give a class of random walks with symmetric
heavy-tailed increments for which $G_n$ is transient in $d=1$.
