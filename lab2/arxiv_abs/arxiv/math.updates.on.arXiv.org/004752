Let $\mathcal{H}_0(\mathbb{D})$ be the class of all analytic functions $f$ in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}
= \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| < 1 \}$ with $f(0)=0 \text{ and } f_t'(0) > 0$. Let $\mathfrak{B} = \{ \omega
\in \mathcal{H}_0(\mathbb{D}) : \omega(\mathbb{D}) \subset \mathbb{D}\}$. We say that a one
parameter family of analytic functions $\{ f_t \}_{t \in I}$ in $\mathcal{H}_0(\mathbb{D})$ on
an interval $I \subset [-\infty, \infty]$, is a Loewner chain if $f_s$ is subordinate to $f_t$ whenever
$s,t \in I$ with $s<t$, i.e., there exists $\omega_{s,t} \in \mathfrak{B}$ with $f_s = f_t \circ
\omega_{s,t}$. Notice that we omit the univalence assumption on each $f_t$. We shall show that if
$f_t'(0)$ is continuous and strictly increasing in $t$, then $f(z,t) := f_t(z)$ satisfies a partial
differential equation which is a generalization of Loewner-Kufarev equation, and $\{ f_t \}_{t
\in I}$ can be expressed as $f_t = F \circ g_t $, $t \in I$, where $F$ is an analytic function on a disc
$\mathbb{D}(0,r) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| < r \}$ with $r = \lim_{t \uparrow \sup I}f_t'(0) \in (0,
\infty ]$ and $F(0)= F'(0)-1=0$, and $\{ g_t \}_{t \in I}$ is a Loewner chain consists of univalent
functions. In the second half we deals with Loewner chains $\{ f_t \}_{t \in I}$ consists of universal
covering maps which may be the most geometrically natural generalization of Loewner chains of univalent
functions. For each $t \in I$ let $C(f_t(\mathbb{D}))$ be the connectivity of image domain of $f_t(\mathbb{D})$.
We shall show that if $\{ f_t \}_{t\in I}$ is continuous, then the function $C(f_t(\mathbb{D}))$
is nondecreasing and left continuous. Then we develop a Loewner theory on Fuchsian groups.
