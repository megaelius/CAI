Large dimensional Gram type matrices are common objects in high-dimensional statistics and machine
learning. In this paper, we study the limiting distribution of the edge eigenvalues for a general
class of high-dimensional Gram type random matrices, including separable sample covariance matrices,
sparse sample covariance matrices, bipartite stochastic block model and random Gram matrices
with general variance profiles. Specifically, we prove that under (almost) sharp moment conditions
and certain tractable regularity assumptions, the edge eigenvalues, i.e., the largest few eigenvalues
of non-spiked Gram type random matrices or the extremal bulk eigenvalues of spiked Gram type random
matrices, satisfy the Tracy-Widom distribution asymptotically. Our results can be used to construct
adaptive, accurate and powerful statistics for high-dimensional statistical inference. In particular,
we propose data-dependent statistics to infer the number of signals under general noise structure,
test the one-sided sphericity of separable matrix, and test the structure of bipartite stochastic
block model. Numerical simulations show strong support of our proposed statistics. The core of
our proof is to establish the edge universality and Tracy-Widom distribution for a rectangular
Dyson Brownian motion with regular initial data. This is a general strategy to study the edge statistics
for high-dimensional Gram type random matrices without exploring the specific independence structure
of the target matrices. It has potential to be applied to more general random matrices that are beyond
the ones considered in this paper.
