This thesis considers three models which describe a multihop ad-hoc telecommunication system.
These systems consist of users sending messages, which can jump to other users to reach the target
user. The first two models have already been examined extensively, whereas it is the first time the
third model is studied. In all these models our goal is to understand under which conditions users
situated far away from each other can communicate. This is the fundamental question of continuum
percolation, which was introduced by Gilbert (1961), who established the Boolean model for Poisson
point processes. In the first part of this thesis we introduce this model and prove the existence
of a phase transition between a subcritical phase, where no infinite connected component of users
exists, and a supercritical phase, where such a component exists. We also consider the case of random
connection radii, following Meester and Roy (1996). In the second part we study the SINR model for
Cox point processes in two or higher dimensions, following T\'obi\'as (2019). He proved that there
exists a phase transition under certain stabilization and connectedness conditions on the intensity
measure. The SINR model for homogeneous Poisson point processes in $\mathbb R^2$ was introduced
by Dousse et al. (2005). In the third part we study percolation in the SINR model with random powers
for Poisson point processes in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 2$. This model was studied by Kong and Yeh (2007)
for $d=2$ under strong boundedness conditions on the random power. In this thesis we weaken these
conditions and only assume that the random power is nonnegative, integrable and not a.s. zero. We
show that there exists a subcritical phase if the path-loss function decays fast enough. Further,
we prove that a supercritical phase exists if random power has a large enough essential supremum
and some exponential moments.
