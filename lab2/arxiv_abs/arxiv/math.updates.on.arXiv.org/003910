We consider the problem of distributed estimation of a Gaussian vector with linear observation
model. Each sensor makes a scalar noisy observation of the unknown vector, quantizes its observation,
maps it to a digitally modulated symbol, and transmits the symbol over orthogonal power-constrained
fading channels to a fusion center (FC). The FC is tasked with fusing the received signals from sensors
and estimating the unknown vector. We derive the Bayesian Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for three
types of receivers: (i) coherent receiver (ii) noncoherent receiver with known channel envelopes
(iii) noncoherent receiver with known channel statistics only. We also derive the Weiss-Weinstein
bound (WWB). We formulate two constrained optimization problems, namely maximizing trace and
log-determinant of Bayesian FIM under network transmit power constraint, with sensors transmit
powers being the optimization variables. We show that for coherent receiver, these problems are
concave. However, for noncoherent receivers, they are not necessarily concave. The solution to
the trace of Bayesian FIM maximization problem can be implemented in a distributed fashion. We numerically
investigate how the FIM-max power allocation across sensors depends on the sensors observation
qualities and physical layer parameters as well as the network transmit power constraint. Moreover,
we evaluate the system performance in terms of MSE using the solutions of FIM-max schemes, and compare
it with the solution obtained from minimizing the MSE of the LMMSE estimator (MSE-min scheme), and
that of uniform power allocation. These comparisons illustrate that, although the WWB is tighter
than the inverse of Bayesian FIM, it is still suitable to use FIM-max schemes, since the performance
loss in terms of the MSE of the LMMSE estimator is not significant.
