We develop in this paper the principles of an associative algebraic approach to bulk logarithmic
conformal field theories (LCFTs). We concentrate on the closed $gl(1|1)$ spin-chain and its continuum
limit - the $c=-2$ symplectic fermions theory - and rely on two technical companion papers, "Continuum
limit and symmetries of the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain" [Nucl. Phys. B 871 (2013) 245-288] and "Bimodule
structure in the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain" [Nucl. Phys. B 871 (2013) 289-329]. Our main result
is that the algebra of local Hamiltonians, the Jones-Temperley-Lieb algebra JTL_N, goes over in
the continuum limit to a bigger algebra than the product of the left and right Virasoro algebras.
This algebra, S - which we call interchiral, mixes the left and right moving sectors, and is generated,
in the symplectic fermions case, by the additional field $S(z,\bar{z})=S_{ab}\psi^a(z)\bar{\psi}^b(\bar{z})$,
with a symmetric form $S_{ab}$ and conformal weights (1,1). We discuss in details how the Hilbert
space of the LCFT decomposes onto representations of this algebra, and how this decomposition is
related with properties of the finite spin-chain. We show that there is a complete correspondence
between algebraic properties of finite periodic spin chains and the continuum limit. An important
technical aspect of our analysis involves the fundamental new observation that the action of JTL_N
in the $gl(1|1)$ spin chain is in fact isomorphic to an enveloping algebra of a certain Lie algebra,
itself a non semi-simple version of $sp(N-2)$. The semi-simple part of JTL_N is represented by $Usp(N-2)$,
providing a beautiful example of a classical Howe duality, for which we have a non semi-simple version
in the full JTL image represented in the spin-chain. On the continuum side, simple modules over the
interchiral algebra S are identified with "fundamental" representations of $sp(\infty)$.
