Large numbers of flow simulations are typically required for determining optimal well settings.
These simulations are often computationally demanding, which poses challenges for the optimizations.
In this paper we present a new two-step surrogate treatment (ST) that reduces the computational
expense associated with well control optimization. The method is applicable for oil production
via waterflood, with well rates optimized at a single control period. The two-step ST entails two
separate optimizations, which can both be performed very efficiently. In the first optimization,
optimal well-rate ratios (i.e., the fraction of total injection or production associated with
each well) are determined such that a measure of velocity variability over the field is minimized,
leading to more uniform sweep. In the second step, overall injection and production rates are determined.
The flow physics in the first step is highly simplified, while the actual physical system is simulated
in the second step. Near-globally-optimal results can be determined in both cases, as the first
optimization is posed as a QP problem, and the second step entails just a single optimization variable.
Under full parallelization, the overall elapsed time for the ST corresponds to the runtime for 1-2
full-order simulations. Results are presented for multiple well configurations, for 2D and 3D
channelized models, and comparisons with formal optimization procedures (MADS and adjoint-gradient)
are conducted. Three different fluid mobility ratios (M = 1, 3 and 5) are considered. Optimization
results demonstrate that the two-step ST provides results in reasonable agreement with those from
MADS and adjoint-gradient, with speedups of 5x or more. We also show that the ST is applicable in the
inner-loop in field development optimization, where it will be especially useful since many different
well configurations must be evaluated.
