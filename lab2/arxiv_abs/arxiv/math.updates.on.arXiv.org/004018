Let $\mathbf{k}$ be a fixed field of arbitrary characteristic, and let $\Lambda$ be a finite dimensional
$\mathbf{k}$-algebra. Assume that $V$ is a left $\Lambda$-module of finite dimension over $\mathbf{k}$.
F. M. Bleher and the author previously proved that $V$ has a well-defined versal deformation ring
$R(\Lambda,V)$ which is a local complete commutative Noetherian ring with residue field isomorphic
to $\mathbf{k}$. Moreover, $R(\Lambda,V)$ is universal if the endomorphism ring of $V$ is isomorphic
to $\mathbf{k}$. In this article we prove that if $\Lambda$ is a basic connected cycle Nakayama algebra
without simple modules and $V$ is a Gorenstein-projective left $\Lambda$-module, then $R(\Lambda,V)$
is universal. Moreover, we also prove that the universal deformation rings $R(\Lambda,V)$ and
$R(\Lambda, \Omega V)$ are isomorphic, where $\Omega V$ denotes the first syzygy of $V$. This result
extends the one obtained by F. M. Bleher and D. J. Wackwitz concerning universal deformation rings
of finitely generated modules over self-injective Nakayama algebras. In addition, we also prove
the following result concerning versal deformation rings of finitely generated modules over triangular
matrix finite dimensional algebras. Let $\Sigma=\begin{pmatrix} \Lambda & B\\0& \Gamma\end{pmatrix}$
be a triangular matrix finite dimensional Gorenstein $\mathbf{k}$-algebra with $\Gamma$ of finite
global dimension and $B$ projective as a left $\Lambda$-module. If $\begin{pmatrix} V\\W\end{pmatrix}_f$
is a finitely generated Gorenstein-projective left $\Sigma$-module, then the versal deformation
rings $R\left(\Sigma,\begin{pmatrix} V\\W\end{pmatrix}_f\right)$ and $R(\Lambda,V)$ are
isomorphic.
