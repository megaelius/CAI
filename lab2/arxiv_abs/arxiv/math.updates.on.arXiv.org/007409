In this work we extend the theory of global pseudo-differential operators on compact Lie groups
to a subelliptic context. More precisely, given a compact Lie group $G$, and the sub-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$
associated to a system of vector fields $X=\{X_1,\cdots,X_k\}$ satisfying the H\"ormander condition,
we introduce a (subelliptic) pseudo-differential calculus associated to $\mathcal{L},$ based
on the matrix-valued quantisation process developed in [107]. This theory will be developed as
follows. First, we will investigate the singular kernels of this calculus, estimates of $L^p$-$L^p$,
$H^1$-$L^1$, $L^\infty$-$BMO$ type and also the weak (1,1) boundedness of these subelliptic H\"ormander
classes. Between the obtained estimates we prove subelliptic versions of the celebrated sharp
Fefferman $L^p$-theorem and the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt theorem. The obtained estimates will
be used to establish the boundedness of subelliptic operators on subelliptic Sobolev and Besov
spaces. We will investigate the ellipticity, the construction of parametrices, the heat traces
and the regularisation of traces for the developed subelliptic calculus. A subelliptic global
functional calculus will be established. This subelliptic functional calculus will be used to
prove a subelliptic version of the G\r{a}rding inequality, which we also use to study the global
solvability for a class of subelliptic pseudo-differential problems. Finally, by using both,
the matrix-valued symbols and also the notion of matrix-valued phases we study the $L^2$-boundedness
of global Fourier integral operators. The approach established in characterising our subelliptic
H\"ormander classes (by proving that the definition of these classes is independent of certain
parameters) also will be applied in order to characterise the global H\"ormander classes on arbitrary
graded Lie groups developed in [65].
