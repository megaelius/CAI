We study the long-term qualitative behavior of randomly perturbed dynamical systems. More specifically,
we look at limit cycles of certain stochastic differential equations (SDE) with Markovian switching,
in which the process switches at random times among different systems of SDEs, when the switching
is fast varying and the diffusion (white noise) term is slowly changing. The system is modeled by
$$ dX^{\varepsilon,\delta}(t)=f(X^{\varepsilon,\delta}(t), \alpha^\varepsilon(t))dt+\sqrt{\delta}\sigma(X^{\varepsilon,\delta}(t),
\alpha^\varepsilon(t))dW(t) , \ X^\varepsilon(0)=x, $$ where $\alpha^\varepsilon(t)$ is a
finite state space, Markov chain with generator $Q/\varepsilon=\big(q_{ij}/\varepsilon\big)_{m_0\times
m_0}$ with $Q$ being irreducible. The relative changing rates of the switching and the diffusion
are highlighted by the two small parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$. We associate to the system
the averaged ordinary differential equation (ODE) \[ d\bar X(t)=\bar f(\bar X(t))dt, \bar X(0)=x,
\] where $\bar f(\cdot)=\sum_{i=1}^{m_0}f(\cdot, i)\nu_i$ and $(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_{m_0})$
is the unique invariant probability measure of the Markov chain with generator $Q$. Suppose that
for each pair $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ of parameters, the process has an invariant probability
measure $\mu^{\varepsilon,\delta}$, and that the averaged ODE has a limit cycle in which there
is an averaged occupation measure $\mu^0$ for the averaged equation. We are able to prove, under
weak conditions, that if $\bar f$ has finitely many stable or hyperbolic fixed points, then $\mu^{\varepsilon,\delta}$
converges weakly to $\mu^0$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ and $\delta \to 0$. Finally, we fully work out
an example of our results for a stochastic predator-prey model and present some numerical examples.
