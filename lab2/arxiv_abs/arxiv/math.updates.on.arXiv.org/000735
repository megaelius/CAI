We investigate an immediate application in finite strain multiplicative plasticity of the family
of isotropic volumetric-isochoric decoupled strain energies \begin{align*} F\mapsto W_{_{\rm
eH}}(F):=\left\{\begin{array}{lll} \frac{\mu}{k}\,e^{k\,\|{\rm dev}_n\log {U}\|^2}+\frac{\kappa}{2{\widehat{k}}}e^{\widehat{k}\,[{\rm
tr}(\log U)]^2}&\text{if}& {\rm det}\, F>0,\\ +\infty &\text{if} &\det
F\leq 0, \end{array}\right.\quad \end{align*} based on the Hencky-logarithmic strain tensor
$\log U$. Here, $\mu>0$ is the infinitesimal shear modulus, $\kappa>0$ is the infinitesimal
bulk modulus, $k,\widehat{k}$ are dimensionless fitting parameters, $F=\nabla \varphi$ is the
gradient of deformation, $U=\sqrt{F^T F}$ is the right stretch tensor and ${\rm dev}_n\log {U}$
is the deviatoric part of the strain tensor $\log U$. Based on the multiplicative decomposition
$F=F_e\, F_p$, we couple these energies with some isotropic elasto-plastic flow rules $F_p\,\frac{\rm
d}{{\rm d t}}[F_p^{-1}]\in-\partial \chi({\rm dev}_3 \Sigma_{e})$ defined in the plastic distortion
$F_p$, where $\partial \chi$ is the subdifferential of the indicator function $\chi$ of the convex
elastic domain $\mathcal{E}_{\rm e}(W_{\rm iso},{\Sigma_{e}},\frac{1}{3}{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{\!\mathbf{y}}^2)$
in the mixed-variant $\Sigma_{e}$-stress space and $\Sigma_{e}=F_e^T D_{F_e} W_{\rm iso}(F_e)$.
While $W_{_{\rm eH}}$ may loose ellipticity, we show that loss of ellipticity is effectively prevented
by the coupling with plasticity, since the ellipticity domain of $W_{_{\rm eH}}$ on the one hand,
and the elastic domain in $\Sigma_{e}$-stress space on the other hand, are closely related. We also
review in detail existing isotropic elasto-plastic models based on 6-dimensional flow rules for
the positive definite plastic metric tensor $C_p=F_p^T\, F_p$ and highlight their properties
and interconnections.
