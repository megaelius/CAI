In a recent paper, Caron and Fox suggest a probabilistic model for sparse graphs which are exchangeable
when associating each vertex with a time parameter in $\mathbb{R}_+$. Here we show that by generalizing
the classical definition of graphons as functions over probability spaces to functions over $\sigma$-finite
measure spaces, we can model a large family of exchangeable graphs, including the Caron-Fox graphs
and the traditional exchangeable dense graphs as special cases. Explicitly, modelling the underlying
space of features by a $\sigma$-finite measure space $(S,\mathcal{S},\mu)$ and the connection
probabilities by an integrable function $W\colon S\times S\to [0,1]$, we construct a random family
$(G_t)_{t\geq 0}$ of growing graphs such that the vertices of $G_t$ are given by a Poisson point process
on $S$ with intensity $t\mu$, with two points $x,y$ of the point process connected with probability
$W(x,y)$. We call such a random family a graphon process. We prove that a graphon process has convergent
subgraph frequencies (with possibly infinite limits) and that, in the natural extension of the
cut metric to our setting, the sequence converges to the generating graphon. We also show that the
underlying graphon is identifiable only as an equivalence class over graphons with cut distance
zero. More generally, we study metric convergence for arbitrary (not necessarily random) sequences
of graphs, and show that a sequence of graphs has a convergent subsequence if and only if it has a subsequence
satisfying a property we call uniform regularity of tails. Finally, we prove that every graphon
is equivalent to a graphon on $\mathbb{R}_+$ equipped with Lebesgue measure.
