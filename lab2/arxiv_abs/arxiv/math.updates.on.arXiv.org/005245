Let $X$ be a super-Brownian motion (SBM) defined on a domain $E\subset R^n$ and $(X_D)$ be its exit
measures indexed by sub-domains of $E$. The relationship between the equation $1/2 \Delta u=2 u^2$
and Super-Brownian motion (SBM) is analogous to the relationship between Brownian motion and the
Laplace's equation, and substantial progress has been made on the study of the solutions of this
semi-linear p.d.e. exploring this analogy. An area that remains to be explored is Martin boundary
theory. Martin boundary in the semi-linear case is defined as the convex set of extreme $X$-harmonic
functions which are functions on the space of finite measures supported in a domain $E$ of $R^d$ and
characterized by a mean value property with respect to the Super-Brownian law. So far no probabilistic
construction of Martin boundary is known. In this paper, we consider a bounded smooth domain $D$,
and we investigate exit densities of SBM, a certain family of $X$ harmonic functions, $H^{\nu}$,
indexed by finite measures $\nu$ on $\partial{D}$, These densities were first introduced by E.B.
Dynkin and also identified by T.Salisbury and D. Sezer as the extended X-harmonic functions corresponding
to conditioning SBM on its exit measure $X_D$ being equal to $\nu$. $H^{\nu}(\mu)$ can be thought
as the analogue of the Poisson kernel for Brownian motion. It is well known that Poisson kernel for
a smooth domain $D$ is equivalent to the so called Martin kernel, the class of extreme harmonic functions
for $D$. We show that a similar result is true for Super-Brownian motion as well, that is $H^{\nu}$
is extreme for almost all $\nu$ with respect to a certain measure.
