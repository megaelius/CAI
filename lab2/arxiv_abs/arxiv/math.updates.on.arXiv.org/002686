Efficient dissemination of videos is an important problem for mobile telecom carriers. In this
paper, to facilitate massive video dissemination, we study joint caching and multicasting for
multi-quality videos encoded using two video encoding techniques, namely scalable video coding
(SVC), and HEVC or H.264 as in dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) respectively, in a large-scale
wireless network. First, for each type of videos, we propose a random caching and multicasting scheme,
carefully reflecting the relationships between layers of an SVC-based video or descriptions of
a DASH-based video. Then, for each type of videos, we derive tractable expressions for the successful
transmission probability in the general and high user density regions respectively, utilizing
tools from stochastic geometry. The analytical results reveal that in the high user density region,
the marginal increase of the successful transmission probability with respect to the caching probability
of a video with certain quality reduces when the caching probability increases. Next, for each type
of videos, we consider the maximization of the successful transmission probability in the high
user density region, which is a convex problem with an exceedingly large number of optimization
variables. We propose a two-stage optimization method to obtain a low-complexity near optimal
solution by solving a relaxed convex problem and a related packing problem. The optimization results
reveal the impact of the caching gain of a layer for an SVC-based video or a description for a DASH-based
video on its caching probability. Finally, we show that the proposed solution for each type of videos
achieves a significant performance gain over baseline schemes and SVC is preferable when the popularity
distribution over quality levels is flat or the layered encoding overhead is small, by numerical
simulations.
