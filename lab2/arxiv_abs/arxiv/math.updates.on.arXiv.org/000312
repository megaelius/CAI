We quantise the massless vector potential A of electromagnetism in the presence of a classical electromagnetic
(background) current, j, in a generally covariant way on arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes
M. By carefully following general principles and procedures we clarify a number of topological
issues. First we combine the interpretation of A as a connection on a principal U(1)-bundle with
the perspective of general covariance to deduce a physical gauge equivalence relation, which is
intimately related to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. By Peierls' method we subsequently find a Poisson
bracket on the space of local, affine observables of the theory. This Poisson bracket is in general
degenerate, leading to a quantum theory with non-local behaviour. We show that this non-local behaviour
can be fully explained in terms of Gauss' law. Thus our analysis establishes a relationship, via
the Poisson bracket, between the Aharonov-Bohm effect and Gauss' law (a relationship which seems
to have gone unnoticed so far). Furthermore, we find a formula for the space of electric monopole
charges in terms of the topology of the underlying spacetime. Because it costs little extra effort,
we emphasise the cohomological perspective and derive our results for general p-form fields A (p
< dim(M)), modulo exact fields. In conclusion we note that the theory is not locally covariant,
in the sense of Brunetti-Fredenhagen-Verch. It is not possible to obtain such a theory by dividing
out the centre of the algebras, nor is it physically desirable to do so. Instead we argue that electromagnetism
forces us to weaken the axioms of the framework of local covariance, because the failure of locality
is physically well-understood and should be accommodated.
