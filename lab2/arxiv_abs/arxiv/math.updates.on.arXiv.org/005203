Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum
and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that
are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve
high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency
of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in the paper an IRS-assisted
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs
are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP)
to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim
to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect
phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely,
the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and energy
harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately
coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient
as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations
on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based
method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRSs, we further propose a low-complexity
algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts of all IRSs in parallel.
