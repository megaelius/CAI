We prove the converse to a result of Karlin [Trans. AMS 1964], and also strengthen his result and two
results of Schoenberg [Ann. of Math. 1955]. One of the latter results concerns zeros of Laplace transforms
of multiply positive functions. The other results study which powers $\alpha$ of two specific kernels
are totally non-negative of order $p\geq 2$ (denoted TN$_p$); both authors showed this happens
for $\alpha\geq p-2$, and Schoenberg proved that it does not for $\alpha<p-2$. We show more strongly
that for every $p \times p$ submatrix of either kernel, up to a shift, its $\alpha$th power is totally
positive of order $p$ (TP$_p$) for every $\alpha > p-2$, and is not TN$_p$ for every $\alpha\in(0,p-2)\setminus\mathbb{Z}$.
In particular, these results reveal a 'critical exponent' phenomenon in total positivity. (This
exponent $(p-2)$ was first discovered by FitzGerald-Horn in [JMAA 1977] for positivity.) We also
provide a characterization for Polya frequency functions of order $p \geq 3$, following Schoenberg's
result for $p=2$ in [J. Analyse Math. 1951]. Our proofs are self-contained, with three exceptions.
We further classify the powers preserving all TN$_p$ Hankel kernels on intervals, and isolate individual
kernels encoding these powers. We then transfer results on preservers by Polya-Szego (1925), Loewner/Horn
(1969), and Khare-Tao (2017), from positive semidefinite matrices to Hankel TN$_p$ kernels. An
additional application of the proofs is to construct individual matrices that encode the Loewner
convex powers. This complements Jain's results (2020) for Loewner positivity, which we strengthen
to total positivity, with self-contained proofs. Remarkably, these (strengthened) results of
Jain, those of Schoenberg and Karlin, the latter's converse, and the aforementioned individual
Hankel kernels all arise from a single symmetric rank-two kernel and its powers: $\max(1+xy,0)$.
