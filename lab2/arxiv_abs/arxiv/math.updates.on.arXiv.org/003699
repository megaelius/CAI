Herein, we focus on explicit constructions of $\ell\times\ell$ binary kernels with small scaling
exponent for $\ell \le 64$. In particular, we exhibit a sequence of binary linear codes that approaches
capacity on the BEC with quasi-linear complexity and scaling exponent $\mu < 3$. To the best of our
knowledge, such a sequence of codes was not previously known to exist. The principal challenges
in establishing our results are twofold: how to construct such kernels and how to evaluate their
scaling exponent. In a single polarization step, an $\ell\times\ell$ kernel $K_\ell$ transforms
an underlying BEC into $\ell$ bit-channels $W_1,W_2,\ldots,W_\ell$. The erasure probabilities
of $W_1,W_2,\ldots,W_\ell$, known as the polarization behavior of $K_\ell$, determine the resulting
scaling exponent $\mu(K_\ell)$. We first introduce a class of self-dual binary kernels and prove
that their polarization behavior satisfies a strong symmetry property. This reduces the problem
of constructing $K_\ell$ to that of producing a certain nested chain of only $\ell/2$ self-orthogonal
codes. We use nested cyclic codes, whose distance is as high as possible subject to the orthogonality
constraint, to construct the kernels $K_{32}$ and $K_{64}$. In order to evaluate the polarization
behavior of $K_{32}$ and $K_{64}$, two alternative trellis representations (which may be of independent
interest) are proposed. Using the resulting trellises, we show that $\mu(K_{32})=3.122$ and explicitly
compute over half of the polarization behavior coefficients for $K_{64}$, at which point the complexity
becomes prohibitive. To complete the computation, we introduce a Monte-Carlo interpolation method,
which produces the estimate $\mu(K_{64})\simeq 2.87$. We augment this estimate with a rigorous
proof that, with high probability, we have $\mu(K_{64})\le 2.99$.
