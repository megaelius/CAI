Mixed (time-consistent) equilibrium solution is proposed in this paper for the time-inconsistent
stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control. In Example 2 of Section 5, for all the time-state
initial pairs the mixed equilibrium solution must exist and ten of such solutions are constructed,
while it is shown that the open-loop equilibrium control and the feedback equilibrium strategy
do not exist for some initial pairs. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mixed equilibrium solution,
which will give us more flexibility to deal with the time-inconsistent optimal control. A mixed
equilibrium solution contains two different parts: the pure-feedback-strategy part and the open-loop-control
part, which together constitute a time-consistent solution. It is shown that the open-loop-control
part will be of the feedback form of the equilibrium state. If we let the pure-feedback-strategy
part be zero or let the open-loop-control part be not dependent on the initial state, then the mixed
equilibrium solution will reduce to the open-loop equilibrium control and the (linear) feedback
equilibrium strategy, respectively, both of which have been extensively studied in existing literature.
Three sets of difference equations are derived to equivalently characterize the fact that a pair
of pure-feedback strategy and open-loop control is a mixed equilibrium solution (for a time-state
initial pair). The difference equations are obtained via maximum-principle-like methodology
together with forward-backward stochastic difference equations. Furthermore, for the cases
with all the time-state initial pairs, neat necessary and sufficient conditions are also derived.
By applying the derived theory, the multi-period mean-variance portfolio selection is investigated.
