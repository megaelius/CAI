Recently, stimulated by financial applications and $L^0$--convex optimization, Guo, et.al introduced
the notion of $L^0$--convex compactness for an $L^0$--convex subset of a Hausdorff topological
module over the topological algebra $L^0(\mathcal{F},K)$, where $K$ is the scalar field of real
or complex numbers and $L^0(\mathcal{F},K)$ the algebra of equivalence classes of $K$--valued
measurable functions defined on a $\sigma$--finite measure space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mu)$,
endowed with the topology of convergence locally in measure. A complete random normed module $($briefly,
$RN$ module$)$, as a random generalization of a Banach space, is just such a kind of topological module,
this paper further introduces the notion of random normal structure and gives various kinds of determination
theorems for a closed $L^0$--convex subset to have random normal structure or $L^0$--convex compactness,
in particular we prove a characterization theorem for a closed $L^0$--convex subset to have $L^0$--convex
compactness, which can be regarded as a generalization of the famous James characterization theorem
for a closed convex subset of a Banach space to be weakly compact. Based on these preparations, we
generalize the classical Kirk's fixed point theorem from a Banach space to a complete $RN$ module
as follows: Let $(E,\|\cdot\|)$ be a complete $RN$ module and $V \subset E$ a nonempty $L^0$--convexly
compact closed $L^0$--convex subset with random normal structure, then every nonexpansive self--mapping
$f$ from $V$ to $V$ has a fixed point in $V$. The generalized Kirk's fixed point theorem is also of fundamental
importance in random functional analysis, for example, we can derive from it a very general random
fixed point theorem, which unifies and improves several known random fixed point theorems for random
nonexpansive mappings.
