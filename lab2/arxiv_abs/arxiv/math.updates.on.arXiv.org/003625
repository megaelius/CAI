Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a central topic in mathematical optimization with extensive
studies on its efficient solvers. Recently, quantum algorithms with superpolynomial speedups
for solving SDPs have been proposed assuming access to its constraint matrices in quantum superposition.
Mutually inspired by both classical and quantum SDP solvers, in this paper we present a sublinear
classical algorithm for solving low-rank SDPs which is asymptotically as good as existing quantum
algorithms. Specifically, given an SDP with $m$ constraint matrices, each of dimension $n$ and
rank $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$, our algorithm gives a succinct description and any entry of the solution
matrix in time $O(m\cdot\mathrm{poly}(\log n,1/\varepsilon))$ given access to a sample-based
low-overhead data structure of the constraint matrices, where $\varepsilon$ is the precision
of the solution. In addition, we apply our algorithm to a quantum state learning task as an application.
Technically, our approach aligns with both the SDP solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight
(MMW) framework and the recent studies of quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms. The cost
of solving SDPs by MMW mainly comes from the exponentiation of Hermitian matrices, and we propose
two new technical ingredients (compared to previous sample-based algorithms) for this task that
may be of independent interest: $\bullet$ Weighted sampling: assuming sampling access to each
individual constraint matrix $A_{1},\ldots,A_{\tau}$, we propose a procedure that gives a good
approximation of $A=A_{1}+\cdots+A_{\tau}$. $\bullet$ Symmetric approximation: we propose
a sampling procedure that gives low-rank spectral decomposition of a Hermitian matrix $A$. This
improves upon previous sampling procedures that only give low-rank singular value decompositions,
losing the signs of eigenvalues.
