This paper is devoted to the relationships and properties of the endograph metric and the $\Gamma$-convergence.
The main contents can be divided into three closely related parts.Firstly, on a very general class
of fuzzy sets, we find a condition such that an endograph metric convergent sequence is exactly a
$\Gamma$-convergent sequence satisfying this condition. Secondly, based on investigations
of level characterizations of fuzzy sets themselves, we present level characterizations (level
decomposition properties) of the endograph metric and the $\Gamma$-convergence. In general,the
$\Gamma$-convergence is weaker than the endograph metric convergence. It is worth mentioning
that, using the condition and the level characterizations given above, we discover the fact: the
endograph metric and the $\Gamma$-convergence are compatible on a large class of general fuzzy
sets which do not have any assumptions of normality, convexity or star-shapedness. Its subsets
include common particular fuzzy sets such as fuzzy numbers (compact and noncompact), fuzzy star-shaped
numbers (compact and noncompact), and general fuzzy star-shaped numbers (compact and noncompact).
This means that the Hausdorff metric metrizes the Fell topology on the set of endographs of these
fuzzy sets. Thirdly, on the basis of the conclusions presented above, we study various subspaces
of the space of upper semi-continuous fuzzy sets equipped with the endograph metric. These subspaces
include several general fuzzy set spaces and all the common particular fuzzy set spaces mentioned
here. We present characterizations of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness
in these fuzzy set spaces. We clarify relationships among these fuzzy set spaces. It is pointed out
that the fuzzy set spaces of noncompact type are exactly the completions of their compact counterparts
under the endograph metric.
