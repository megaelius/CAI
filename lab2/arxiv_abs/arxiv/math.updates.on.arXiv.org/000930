We develop new optimization methodology for planning installation of Flexible Alternating Current
Transmission System (FACTS) devices of the parallel and shunt types into large power transmission
systems, which allows to delay or avoid installations of generally much more expensive power lines.
Methodology takes as an input projected economic development, expressed through a paced growth
of the system loads, as well as uncertainties, expressed through multiple scenarios of the growth.
We price new devices according to their capacities. Installation cost contributes to the optimization
objective in combination with the cost of operations integrated over time and averaged over the
scenarios. The multi-stage (-time-frame) optimization aims to achieve a gradual distribution
of new resources in space and time. Constraints on the investment budget, or equivalently constraint
on building capacity, is introduced at each time frame. Our approach adjusts operationally not
only newly installed FACTS devices but also other already existing flexible degrees of freedom.
This complex optimization problem is stated using the most general AC Power Flows. Non-linear,
non-convex, multiple-scenario and multi-time-frame optimization is resolved via efficient
heuristics, consisting of a sequence of alternating Linear Programmings or Quadratic Programmings
(depending on the generation cost) and AC-PF solution steps designed to maintain operational feasibility
for all scenarios. Computational scalability and application of the newly developed approach
is illustrated on the example of the 2736-nodes large Polish system. One most important advantage
of the framework is that the optimal capacity of FACTS is build up gradually at each time frame in a
limited number of locations, thus allowing to prepare the system better for possible congestion
due to future economic and other uncertainties.
