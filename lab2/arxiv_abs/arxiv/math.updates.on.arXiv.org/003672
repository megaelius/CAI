The main motivation behind extending the notion of Age-of-Information (AoI) to Networked Control
Systems (NCS) stems from recent results suggesting that AoI can be used to reformulate some of the
traditional NCS problems with a new perspective. In fact, lower AoI in a NCS results in lower estimation/control
cost. This is intuitive as to improve estimation/control performance it is often desirable to have
access to fresher state information, which is conceptualized as AoI metric. However, AoI is rather
a new concept and hence less understood compared to well-established notions, e.g. delay. Therefore,
it has very recently attracted some attention to characterize the relationship between the AoI
and performance metrics in networked systems. Despite some progress, there are many challenges
still to address in order to develop the fundamental relationship between AoI and the conventional
estimation/control performance metrics. Towards this end, we study an infinite horizon joint
optimization problem of sampling and scheduling in a single-loop NCS with the objective of minimizing
the mean square estimation error. Under some mild assumptions on information structures we show
that the optimal controller can be computed separably while the remaining cost function is characterized
as a non-decreasing function of AoI. Further, we identify a narrow class of LTI control systems for
which minimizing the mean square estimation error coincides exactly with minimizing the expected
AoI. Finally, noting that minimizing the non-decreasing function of AoI in our problem setting
is a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem and is hard to solve, we study heuristic algorithms
by extending existing algorithms in the AoI literature.
