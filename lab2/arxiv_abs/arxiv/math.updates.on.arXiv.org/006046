Channel estimation is challenging for the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless
communications, since the passive RIS cannot transmit or receive pilots. The existing channel
estimation methods estimate the cascaded channel among the base station (BS), the RIS and the user
ends (UEs), i.e., the BS-RIS-UE cascaded channel, which is the compound of the channel between the
base station (BS) and the RIS (BS-RIS channel). Since the number of coefficients of the BS-RIS-UE
cascaded channel is the product of the number of BS antennas, the number of RIS elements, and the number
of UEs, the pilot overhead can be prohibitively high. In this paper, we propose a two-timescale channel
estimation framework. The key idea of the framework is to exploit the property that the BS-RIS channel
is high-dimensional but quasi-static, while the RIS-UE channel is mobile but low-dimensional.
Specifically, to estimate the quasi-static BS-RIS channel, we propose a dual-link pilot transmission
scheme, where the BS transmits downlink pilots and receives uplink pilots reflected by the RIS.
Then, we propose a coordinate descent-based algorithm to recover the BS-RIS channel. Since we only
need to estimate the quasi-static BS-RIS channel in a large timescale, the pilot overhead associated
with this high-dimensional channel can be neglected from a long-term perspective. For the mobile
RIS-UE channel, although it has to be frequently estimated in a small timescale, its dimension is
much smaller than that of the cascaded channel, so the pilot overhead can be significantly reduced.
Simulation results show that the proposed two-timescale channel estimation framework can achieve
accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead.
