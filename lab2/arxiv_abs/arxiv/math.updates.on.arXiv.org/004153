The constrained linear quadratic regulation problem is solved by a continuous piecewise affine
function on a set of state space polytopes. It is an obvious question whether this solution can be
built up iteratively by increasing the horizon, i.e., by extending the classical backward dynamic
programming solution for the unconstrained case to the constrained case. Unfortunately, however,
the piecewise affine solution for horizon N is in general not contained in the piecewise affine law
for horizon N + 1. We show that a backward dynamic programming does, in contrast, result in a useful
structure for the set of the active sets that defines the solution. Essentially, every active set
for the problem with horizon N + 1 results from extending an active set for horizon N , if the constraints
are ordered stage by stage. Consequently, the set for horizon N + 1 can be found by only considering
the constraints of the additional stage. Furthermore, it is easy to detect which polytopes and affine
pieces are invariant to increasing the horizon, and therefore persist in the limit N to infinity.
Several other aspects of the structure of the set of active sets become evident if the active sets
are represented by bit tuples. There exists, for example, a subset of special active sets that generates
a positive invariant and persistent (i.e., horizon invariant) set around the origin. It is very
simple to identify these special active sets, and the positive invariant and persistent region
can be found without solving optimal control or auxiliary optimization problems. The paper briefly
discusses the use of these results in model predictive control. Some opportunities for uses in computational
methods are also briefly summarized.
