In this work, we ask the question: how much adversarial error can protocols for interactive communication
tolerate? This question was examined previously by Braverman and Rao [STOC '11] for the case of "robust"
protocols, where each party sends a message in a fixed and predetermined rounds. All previous work
in interactive communication focused on robust protocols. We consider a new class of protocols
for Interactive Communication, namely, adaptive protocols. Such protocols adapt structurally
to the noise induced by the channel in the sense that at every step of the protocol, parties may choose
whether to talk or be silent according to the (possibly erroneous) messages they receive. We distill
meaningful and increasingly powerful models of adaptivity. The strongest is a fully adaptive model
in which each party dynamically decides when to talk. Next, we define a partially adaptive model
in which each party may only speak at fixed and predetermined times, but it can adaptively change
the length of the protocol by ceasing its participation at any rounds. We study upper and lower bounds
on the permissible noise rate for our models. In the fully adaptive model, we exhibit a protocol that
crucially uses the power of dynamic slot allocation as well as adaptive termination to tolerate
noise rate up to 2/3. In addition we show that if the parties share common randomness then there exists
a protocol that tolerates an optimal noise rate of $1-\epsilon$. For the partially adaptive model,
we demonstrate a protocol that tolerates noise rate up to 1/3. In the non-adaptive model, Braverman
and Rao [STOC '11] exhibited a protocol that tolerates noise rate of $1/4-\epsilon$, and a matching
upper bound of 1/4. We provide an upper bound of 1/4 for a broader class of protocols. We stress that
our upper bound is novel since the impossibility of Braverman and Rao does not carry over to the non-adaptive
model.
