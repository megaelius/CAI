The symmetric six-vertex model with parameters $a,b,c>0$ is expected to exhibit different behavior
in the regimes $a+b<c$ (antiferroelectric), $|a-b|<c\leq a+b$ (disordered) and $|a-b|>c$ (ferroelectric).
In this work, we study the way in which the transition between the regimes $a+b=c$ and $a+b<c$ manifests
in the thermodynamic limit. It is shown that the height function of the six-vertex model delocalizes
with logarithmic variance when $a+b=c$ while remaining localized when $a+b<c$. In the latter regime,
the extremal translation-invariant Gibbs states of the height function are described. Qualitative
differences between the two regimes are further exhibited for the Gibbs states of the six-vertex
model itself. Via a coupling, our results further allow to study the self-dual Ashkin-Teller model
on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. It is proved that on the portion of the self-dual curve $\sinh 2J = e^{-2U}$ where
$J<U$ each of the two Ising configurations exhibits exponential decay of correlations while their
product is ferromagnetically ordered. This is in contrast to the case $J=U$ (the critical 4-state
Potts model) where it is known that all correlations have power-law decay. The proofs rely on the
recently established order of the phase transition in the random-cluster model, which relates
to the six-vertex model via the Baxter-Kelland-Wu coupling. Additional ingredients include the
introduction of a random-cluster model with modified weight for boundary clusters, analysis of
a spin (mixed Ashkin-Teller model) and bond representation (of the FK-Ising type) for the six-vertex
model, both of which are proved to be strongly positively associated, and the introduction of triangular
lattice contours and associated bijection for the analysis of the Gibbs states of the height function.
