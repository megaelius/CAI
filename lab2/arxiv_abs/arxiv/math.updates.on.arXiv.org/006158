Building on a recent characterization of tope graphs of Complexes of Oriented Matroids (COMs),
we tackle and generalize several classical problems in Oriented Matroids, Lopsided Sets (aka ample
set systems), and partial cubes via Metric Graph Theory. These questions are related to the notion
of simpliciality of topes in Oriented Matroids and the concept of corners in Lopsided Sets arising
from computational learning theory. Our first main result is that every element of an Oriented Matroid
from a class introduced by Mandel is incident to a simplicial tope, i.e, such Oriented Matroids contain
no mutation-free elements. This allows us to refute a conjecture of Mandel from 1983, that would
have implied the famous Las Vergnas simplex conjecture. The second main contribution is the introduction
of corners of COMs as a natural generalization of corners in Lopsided Sets. Generalizing results
of Bandelt and Chepoi, Tracy Hall, and Chalopin et al. we prove that realizable COMs, rank 2 COMs,
as well as hypercellular graphs admit corner peelings. On the way we introduce the notion of cocircuit
graphs for pure COMs and disprove a conjecture about realizability in COMs of Bandelt et al. Finally,
we study extensions of Las Vergnas' simplex conjecture in low rank and order. We first consider antipodal
partial cubes -- a vast generalization of oriented matroids also known as acycloids. We prove Las
Vergnas' conjecture for acycloids of rank~3 and for acycloids of order at most 7. Moreover, we confirm
a conjecture of Cordovil-Las Vergnas about the connectivity of the mutation graph of Uniform Oriented
Matroids for ground sets of order at most 9. The latter two results are based on the exhaustive generation
of acycloids and uniform oriented matroids of given order, respectively.
