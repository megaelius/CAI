We propose two types of Quantile Graphical Models (QGMs) --- Conditional Independence Quantile
Graphical Models (CIQGMs) and Prediction Quantile Graphical Models (PQGMs). CIQGMs characterize
the conditional independence of distributions by evaluating the distributional dependence structure
at each quantile index. As such, CIQGMs can be used for validation of the graph structure in the causal
graphical models (\cite{pearl2009causality, robins1986new, heckman2015causal}). One main
advantage of these models is that we can apply them to large collections of variables driven by non-Gaussian
and non-separable shocks. PQGMs characterize the statistical dependencies through the graphs
of the best linear predictors under asymmetric loss functions. PQGMs make weaker assumptions than
CIQGMs as they allow for misspecification. Because of QGMs' ability to handle large collections
of variables and focus on specific parts of the distributions, we could apply them to quantify tail
interdependence. The resulting tail risk network can be used for measuring systemic risk contributions
that help make inroads in understanding international financial contagion and dependence structures
of returns under downside market movements. We develop estimation and inference methods for QGMs
focusing on the high-dimensional case, where the number of variables in the graph is large compared
to the number of observations. For CIQGMs, these methods and results include valid simultaneous
choices of penalty functions, uniform rates of convergence, and confidence regions that are simultaneously
valid. We also derive analogous results for PQGMs, which include new results for penalized quantile
regressions in high-dimensional settings to handle misspecification, many controls, and a continuum
of additional conditioning events.
