Venous valves are bicuspidal valves that ensure that blood in veins only flows back to the heart.
To prevent retrograde blood flow, the two intraluminal leaflets meet in the center of the vein and
occlude the vessel. In fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations of venous valves, the large
structural displacements may lead to mesh deteriorations and entanglements, causing instabilities
of the solver and, consequently, the numerical solution to diverge. In this paper, we propose an
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) scheme for FSI simulations designed to solve these instabilities.
A monolithic formulation for the FSI problem is considered and, due to the complexity of the operators,
the exact Jacobian matrix is evaluated using automatic differentiation. The method relies on the
introduction of a staggered in time velocity %in the discretization scheme to improve stability,
and on fictitious springs to model the contact force of the valve leaflets. Since the large structural
displacements may compromise the quality of the fluid mesh as well, a smoother fluid displacement,
obtained with the introduction of a scaling factor that measures the distance of a fluid element
from the valve leaflet tip, guarantees that there are no mesh entanglements in the fluid domain.
To further improve stability, a Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) method is employed. The
proposed ALE scheme is applied to a 2D model of a venous valve. The presented simulations show that
the proposed method deals well with the large structural displacements of the problem, allowing
a reconstruction of the valve behavior in both the opening and closing phase.
