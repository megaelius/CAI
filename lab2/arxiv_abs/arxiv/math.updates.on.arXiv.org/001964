In this paper we propose a new high order accurate space-time DG finite element scheme for the solution
of the linear elastic wave equations in first order velocity-stress formulation in two and three-space
dimensions on staggered unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The method reaches arbitrary
high order of accuracy in both space and time via the use of space-time basis and test functions. Within
the staggered mesh formulation, we define the discrete velocity field in the control volumes of
a primary mesh, while the discrete stress tensor is defined on a face-based staggered dual mesh.
The space-time DG formulation leads to an implicit scheme that requires the solution of a linear
system for the unknown degrees of freedom at the new time level. The number of unknowns is reduced
at the aid of the Schur complement, so that in the end only a linear system for the degrees of freedom
of the velocity field needs to be solved. Thanks to the use of a spatially staggered mesh, the stencil
of the final velocity system involves only the element and its direct neighbors. The resulting linear
system can be efficiently solved via matrix-free iterative methods. The chosen discretization
and the linear nature of the governing PDE system lead to an unconditionally stable scheme, which
allows large time steps even for low quality meshes that contain sliver elements. The fully discrete
staggered space-time DG method is proven to be energy stable for any order of accuracy, for any mesh
and for any time step size. For the particular case of Crank-Nicolson time discretization and homogeneous
material, the final velocity system can be proven to be symmetric and positive definite and in this
case the scheme is also exactly energy preserving. The new scheme is applied to several test problems
in two and three space dimensions, providing also a comparison with high order explicit ADER-DG
schemes
