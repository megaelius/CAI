This paper is the fifth in a series devoted to the development of a rigorous renormalisation group
method applicable to lattice field theories containing boson and/or fermion fields, and comprises
the core of the method. In the renormalisation group method, increasingly large scales are studied
in a progressive manner, with an interaction parametrised by a field polynomial which evolves with
the scale under the renormalisation group map. In our context, the progressive analysis is performed
via a finite-range covariance decomposition. Perturbative calculations are used to track the
flow of the coupling constants of the evolving polynomial, but on their own perturbative calculations
are insufficient to control error terms and to obtain mathematically rigorous results. In this
paper, we define an additional non-perturbative coordinate, which together with the flow of coupling
constants defines the complete evolution of the renormalisation group map. We specify conditions
under which the non-perturbative coordinate is contractive under a single renormalisation group
step. Our framework is essentially combinatorial, but its implementation relies on analytic results
developed earlier in the series of papers. The results of this paper are applied elsewhere to analyse
the critical behaviour of the 4-dimensional continuous-time weakly self-avoiding walk and of
the 4-dimensional n-component $|\varphi|^4$ model. In particular, the existence of a logarithmic
correction to mean-field scaling for the susceptibility can be proved for both models, together
with other facts about critical exponents and critical behaviour.
