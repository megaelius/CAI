We show that the von Neumann entropy (from herein referred to as the von Neumann index) of a graph's
trace normalized combinatorial Laplacian provides structural information about the level of
centralization across a graph. This is done by considering the Theil index, which is an established
statistical measure used to determine levels of inequality across a system of `agents', e.g., income
levels across a population. Here, we establish a Theil index for graphs, which provides us with a
macroscopic measure of graph centralization. Concretely, we show that the von Neumann index can
be used to bound the graph's Theil index, and thus we provide a direct characterization of graph centralization
via the von Neumann index. Because of the algebraic similarities between the bound and the Theil
index, we call the bound the von Neumann Theil index. %From an information theoretic perspective,
the von Neumann Theil index describes the mutual information between the quantum state corresponding
to a graph and the maximally mixed state (which corresponds to the complete graph). We elucidate
our ideas by providing examples and a discussion of different $n=7$ vertex graphs. We also discuss
how the von Neumann Theil index provides a more comprehensive measure of centralization when compared
to traditional centralization measures, and when compared to the graph's classical Theil index.
This is because it more accurately accounts for macro-structural changes that occur from micro-structural
changes in the graph (e.g., the removal of a vertex). Finally, we provide future direction, showing
that the von Neumann Theil index can be generalized by considering the R\'enyi entropy. We then show
that this generalization can be used to bound the negative logarithm of the graph's Jain fairness
index.
