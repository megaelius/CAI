We consider a point-to-point communication scenario where the receiver maintains a specific linear
function of a message vector over a finite field. When the value of the message vector undergoes a
sparse update, the transmitter broadcasts a coded version of the modified message while the receiver
uses this codeword and the current value of the linear function to update its contents. It is assumed
that the transmitter has access to the modified message but is unaware of the exact difference vector
between the original and modified messages. Under the assumption that the difference vector is
sparse and that its Hamming weight is at the most a known constant, the objective is to design a linear
code with as small a codelength as possible that allows successful update of the linear function
at the receiver. This problem is motivated by applications to distributed data storage systems.
Recently, Prakash and Medard derived a lower bound on the codelength, which is independent of the
size of the underlying finite field, and provided constructions that achieve this bound if the size
of the finite field is sufficiently large. However, this requirement on the field size can be prohibitive
for even moderate values of the system parameters. In this paper, we provide a field-size aware analysis
of the function update problem, including a tighter lower bound on the codelength, and design codes
that trade-off the codelength for a smaller field size requirement. We first characterize the family
of function update problems where linear coding can provide reduction in codelength compared to
a naive transmission scheme. We then provide field-size dependent bounds on the optimal codelength,
and construct coding schemes when the receiver maintains linear functions of striped message vector.
Finally, we show that every function update problem is equivalent to a generalized index coding
problem.
