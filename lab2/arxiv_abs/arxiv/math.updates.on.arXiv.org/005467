We study formal synthesis of control policies for discrete-time stochastic control systems against
complex temporal properties. Our goal is to synthesize a control policy for the system together
with a lower bound on the probability that the system satisfies a complex temporal property. The
desired properties of the system are expressed as a fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL), called
safe-LTL over finite traces. We propose leveraging \emph{control barrier certificates} which
alleviate the issue of the curse of dimensionality associated with discretization-based approaches
existing in the literature. We show how control barrier certificates can be used for synthesizing
policies while guaranteeing lower bounds on the probability of satisfaction for the given property.
Our approach decomposes negation of the specification into sequential reachabilities and then
finds control barrier certificates for computing upper-bounds on the reachability probabilities.
Control policies associated with these barrier certificates are then combined as a hybrid control
policy for the concrete system that guarantees a lower bound on the probability of satisfaction
of the property. We distinguish uncountable and finite input sets in the computation of barrier
certificates. For the former, control barrier certificates can be computed using sum-of-square
optimization. For the latter, we develop a computational method based on counter-example guided
inductive synthesis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a room temperature
control and lane keeping of a vehicle modeled as a four-dimensional single-track kinematic model.
We compare our results with the discretization-based methods in the literature.
