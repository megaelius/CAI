In view of noteworthy communications performance improvements for future B5G/6G (such as cognitive
Internet of Things, space-ground integration network and so on), cooperative communications
(CC) diversity with relays selection algorithms have been extensively studied to significantly
improve communications quality, but so far there is still a lot of potential optimization work with
CC schemes. In this paper, in the light of NP-hard problem of subsets relays selection, further studies
for theorems of relays subsets with K-layers power allocation standard have been put forward to
explore better performance in B5G/6G cognitive IoT (Internet of Things) networks, we propose unified
layers-based optimized mobile relays subsets algorithms for full-duplex (FD) non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) to greatly improve transmission rate. After revealing and taking into account
fundamental properties of relays, such as mobile relays nodes state, relays locations, fading
characteristics and so on, optimized FD-NOMA algorithm based on these relays features has been
presented to improve transmission validity, and a related series of relays subsets theorems have
been derived and proved, then minimum upper bound of maximum transmission rates has been estimated
to reveal two-way balanced optimal transmission conclusion for FD-NOMA. In general, proposed
general and optimized algorithm can be used in multiple future cooperative communications scenarios
in B5G/6G networks such as cognitive IoT. Simulations results show that proposed scheme has several
times transmission rates than other classical relays selection algorithms
