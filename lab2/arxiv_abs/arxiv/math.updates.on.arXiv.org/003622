Let $G$ be a finitely generated pro-$p$ group of positive rank gradient. We show that finitely generated
closed subgroups of infinite index in $G$ never contain any infinite normal subgroups of $G$. This
pro-$p$ version of a well-known theorem of Greenberg generalises similar assertions that were
known to hold for non-abelian free pro-$p$ groups and non-soluble Demushkin pro-$p$ groups. Our
result is reminiscent of Gaboriau's theorem for countable groups with positive first $\ell^2$-Betti
number. The approach we take uses the notion of Hausdorff dimension in pro-$p$ groups. Building
on it, we show that every finitely generated pro-$p$ group $G$ of positive rank gradient has full
Hausdorff spectrum $\text{hspec}^\mathcal{F}(G) = [0,1]$ with respect to the Frattini series
$\mathcal{F}$. Using different, Lie-theoretic techniques we also prove that every finitely generated
non-abelian free pro-$p$ group $F$ has full Hausdorff spectrum $\text{hspec}^\mathcal{Z}(F)
= [0,1]$ with respect to the Zassenhaus series $\mathcal{Z}$. This resolves a long-standing problem
in the subject of Hausdorff dimensions in pro-$p$ groups. In fact, the results about full Hausdorff
spectra hold more generally for finite direct products of finitely generated pro-$p$ groups of
positive rank gradient and non-abelian free pro-$p$ groups, respectively. The results with respect
to the Frattini series generalise further to Hausdorff dimension functions with respect to arbitrary
iterated verbal filtrations, for finite direct products of finitely generated non-abelian free
pro-$p$ groups and non-soluble Demushkin pro-$p$ groups. We also determine the normal Hausdorff
spectra of such direct products.
