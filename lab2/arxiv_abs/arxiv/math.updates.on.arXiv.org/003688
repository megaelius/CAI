A Markovian SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model is considered for the spread of an epidemic
on a configuration model network, in which susceptible individuals may take preventive measures
by dropping edges to infectious neighbours. An effective degree formulation of the model is used
in conjunction with the theory of density dependent population processes to obtain a law of large
numbers and a functional central limit theorem for the epidemic as the population size $N \to \infty$,
assuming that the degrees of individuals are bounded. A central limit theorem is conjectured for
the final size of the epidemic. The results are obtained for both the Molloy-Reed (in which the degrees
of individuals are deterministic) and Newman-Strogatz-Watts (in which the degrees of individuals
are independent and identically distributed) versions of the configuration model. The two versions
yield the same limiting deterministic model but the asymptotic variances in the central limit theorema
are greater in the Newman-Strogatz-Watts version. The basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the
process of susceptible individuals in the limiting deterministic model, for the model with dropping
of edges, are the same as for a corresponding SIR model without dropping of edges but an increased
recovery rate, though, when $R_0>1$, the probability of a major outbreak is greater in the model
with dropping of edges. The results are specialised to the model without dropping of edges to yield
conjectured central limit theorems for the final size of Markovian SIR epidemics on configuration-model
networks, and for the giant components of those networks. The theory is illustrated by numerical
studies, which demonstrate that the asymptotic approximations are good, even for moderate $N$.
