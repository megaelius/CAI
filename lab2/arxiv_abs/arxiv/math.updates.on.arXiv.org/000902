Schr\'{o}dinger's equation with distributional $\delta$, or $\delta'$ potentials has been well
studied in the past. However there remain difficulties: the functional operator cannot exist within
the standard $L^2$ Hilbert spaces. For example, the domain of $\delta(x)$ is not any $L^2$ function.
On differentiable manifolds, the domain of the free kinetic energy operator is in the space of harmonic
forms. Locally, the Hodge decomposition theorem and the standard distributional calculus remain
applicable, and the domain of a $\delta$ or $\delta'$ potential must be orthogonal to the free kinetic
energy operator, which decouples the interaction. The standard $L^2$ Hilbert space seems to be
inadequate for addressing these points. Restricting to semicontinuous topologies presents opportunities
to reconcile these issues. We develop from first principles, and in great detail, the properties
of these spaces. Properties including topological duals, and norm closures are extensively defined
and studied. These spaces allow for certain classes of distributions to be inverted in terms of their
primitive functions. We establish equivalence relations between the cohomology classes of distributions
(via homotopy maps) and derivatives of their associated primitives on local sections. These are
canonical, and define a connection on the fibers of the base space. As a result of semicontinuity,
we are able to resolve the domain and interaction problems stated previously. We arrive at a compatible
domain which is Krein ($\mathfrak{H}$) over a semi-connected manifold with inner product determined
by an indefinite coupling term.
