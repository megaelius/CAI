We consider the problem of correcting mass readout errors in information encoded in binary polymer
strings. Our work builds on results for string reconstruction problems using composition multisets
[Acharya et al., 2015] and the unique string reconstruction framework proposed in [Pattabiraman
et al., 2019]. Binary polymer-based data storage systems [Laure et al., 2016] operate by designing
two molecules of significantly different masses to represent the symbols $\{{0,1\}}$ and perform
readouts through noisy tandem mass spectrometry. Tandem mass spectrometers fragment the strings
to be read into shorter substrings and only report their masses, often with errors due to imprecise
ionization. Modeling the fragmentation process output in terms of composition multisets allows
for designing asymptotically optimal codes capable of unique reconstruction and the correction
of a single mass error [Pattabiraman et al., 2019] through the use of derivatives of Catalan paths.
Nevertheless, no solutions for multiple-mass error-corrections are currently known. Our work
addresses this issue by describing the first multiple-error correction codes that use the polynomial
factorization approach for the Turnpike problem [Skiena et al., 1990] and the related factorization
described in [Acharya et al., 2015]. Adding Reed-Solomon type coding redundancy into the corresponding
polynomials allows for correcting $t$ mass errors in polynomial time using $t^2\, \log\,k$ redundant
bits, where $k$ is the information string length. The redundancy can be improved to $\log\,k + t$.
However, no decoding algorithm that runs polynomial-time in both $t$ and $n$ for this scheme are
currently known, where $n$ is the length of the coded string.
