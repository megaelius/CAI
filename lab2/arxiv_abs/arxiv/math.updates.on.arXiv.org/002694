This thesis presents fuzzy-L1 adaptive controller and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)
with Prescribed Performance Function (PPF) as two adaptive approaches for high nonlinear systems
as two original contribution to the literature. Firstly, L1 adaptive controller has a structure
that allows decoupling between robustness and adaption owing to the use of a low pass filter with
adjustable gain in the feedback loop. The trade-off between performance and robustness is a key
factor in the tuning of the filter's parameters. In fuzzy-L1 adaptive controller, we consider the
class of strictly proper low pass filters with fixed structure but with the feedback gain as the only
tunable parameter. A practical new fuzzy based approach for the tuning of the feedback filter of
L1 adaptive controller is proposed. The fuzzy controller is optimally tuned using Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) to minimize the tracking error and the control signal range. The main function
of the fuzzy logic controller is the on-line tuning of the feedback gain of the filter. Secondly,
an adaptive control of multi-input multi-output uncertain high-order nonlinear system capable
of guaranteeing a predetermined prescribed performance is presented as MRAC with PPF. In this work,
prescribed performance is defined in terms of the tracking error converging to a smaller residual
set at a rate no less than a predefined value and exhibiting a maximum overshoot/undershoot less
than a sufficiently small fixed constant. The key step in such approach is to transform the constrained
system into an equivalent unconstrained one through an adequate transformation of the output error.
This will show that the robust stabilization of the transformed error, guaranties the stability
and convergence of the constrained tracking error within the set of time varying constraints representing
the performance limits.
