This paper offers new mathematical models to measure the most productive scale size (MPSS) of production
systems with mixed structure networks (mixed of series and parallel). In the first property, we
deal with a general multi-stage network which can be transformed, using dummy processes, into a
series of parallel networks. In the second property, we consider a direct network combined with
series and parallel structure. In this paper, we propose new models to measure the overall MPSS of
the production systems and their internal processes. MPSS decomposition is discussed and examined.
As a real-life application, this study measures the efficiency and MPSS of research and development
(R&D) activities of Chinese provinces within an R&D value chain network. In the R&D value chain,
profitability and marketability stages are connected in series, where the profitability stage
is composed of operation and R&D efforts connected in parallel. The MPSS network model provides
not only the MPSS measurement but also values that indicate the appropriate degree of intermediate
measures for the two stages. Improvement strategy is given for each region based on the gap between
the current and the appropriate level of intermediate measures. Our findings show that the marketability
efficiency values of Chinese R&D regions were low, and no regions are operated under the MPSS. As
a result, most Chinese regions performed inefficiently regarding both profitability and marketability.
This finding provides initial evidence that the generally lower profitability and marketability
efficiency of Chinese regions is a severe problem that may be due to wasted resources on production
and R&D.
