This paper explores the co-existence of a macro cell and a small cell for heterogeneous cellular
networks, where a macro-cell base station (MBS) and small-cell base station (SBS) transmit to respective
macro-cell user (MU) and small-cell user (SU) through their shared spectrum in the face of a common
eavesdropper. We consider two spectrum sharing mechanisms, namely the overlay spectrum sharing
(OSS) and underlay spectrum sharing (USS). In the OSS, MBS and SBS take turns to access their shared
spectrum. By contrast, the USS allows MBS and SBS to simultaneously transmit over the shared spectrum
with the aid of power control for limiting their mutual interference, thus called interference-limited
USS (IL-USS). We propose an interference-canceled USS (IC-USS) scheme, where a sophisticatedly-designed
signal is emitted at MBS to cancel out the interference received at MU, which is also beneficial in
terms of defending the common eavesdropper. Closed-form expressions of overall outage probability
and intercept probability are derived for OSS, IL-USS and IC-USS schemes by taking into account
both MBS-MU and SBS-SU transmissions. We prove that the proposed IC-USS can achieve an absolute
security with zero intercept probability for the MBS-MU transmission. The secrecy diversity analysis
is also carried out by characterizing an asymptotic behavior of the overall outage probability
with a given intercept probability in high signal-to-noise ratio region. It is shown that the secrecy
diversity gains of conventional OSS and IL-USS are zero, whereas the proposed IC-USS achieves a
higher secrecy diversity gain of one. Additionally, numerical results demonstrate an obvious
advantage of the proposed IC-USS over OSS and IL-USS against eavesdropping.
