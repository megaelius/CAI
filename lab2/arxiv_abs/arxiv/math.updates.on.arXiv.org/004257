DAGS scheme is a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on quasi-dyadic alternant codes that was
submitted to NIST standardization process for a quantum resistant public key algorithm. Recently
an algebraic attack was devised by Barelli and Couvreur (Asiacrypt 2018) that efficiently recovers
the private key. It shows that DAGS can be totally cryptanalysed by solving a system of bilinear polynomial
equations. However, some sets of DAGS parameters were not broken in practice. In this paper we improve
the algebraic attack by showing that the original approach was not optimal in terms of the ratio of
the number of equations to the number of variables. Contrary to the common belief that reducing at
any cost the number of variables in a polynomial system is always beneficial, we actually observed
that, provided that the ratio is increased and up to a threshold, the solving can be heavily improved
by adding variables to the polynomial system. This enables us to recover the private keys in a few
seconds. Furthermore, our experimentations also show that the maximum degree reached during the
computation of the Gr\"obner basis is an important parameter that explains the efficiency of the
attack. Finally, the authors of DAGS updated the parameters to take into account the algebraic cryptanalysis
of Barelli and Couvreur. In the present article, we propose a hybrid approach that performs an exhaustive
search on some variables and computes a Gr\"obner basis on the polynomial system involving the remaining
variables. We then show that the updated set of parameters corresponding to 128-bit security can
be broken with 2^83 operations.
