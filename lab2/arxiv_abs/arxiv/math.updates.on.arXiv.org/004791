This is the first part of a series of two papers where we study the connection between the $A_\infty$
property of the elliptic measures associated with second order divergence form elliptic operators
on some given domain and the uniform rectifiability of its boundary. When the domain is uniform and
has Ahlfors regular boundary, the case of the Laplacian is well-understood and one has that the associated
harmonic measure belongs to $A_\infty$ with respect to the surface measure if and only if the boundary
of the domain is uniformly rectifiable. Under the same background hypothesis, the first, second,
and fourth named authors of the present paper have shown that an identical equivalence holds for
elliptic measures assuming some control of the derivatives of the coefficients of the elliptic
operator. That control is however stronger than the natural one from the work of Kenig-Pipher. In
this series of papers we show that the previous equivalence holds as well for the Kenig-Pipher operators.
The first step for this characterization is taken in the present paper and we consider the case where
the Kenig-Pipher condition of Carleson type holds with sufficiently small constant. Indeed, we
further show that it suffices to assume an smallness condition for the derivatives of the coefficients
on just Whitney balls. We prove such a result using a compactness argument so that in the limit one
sees a domain of the same type and some constant coefficient operator to which the previous theory
applies. In the second part of this series of papers we address the general result by extrapolating
from the small constant case established here to the "large constant case" where the Kenig-Pipher
condition holds with an arbitrary (large) constant.
