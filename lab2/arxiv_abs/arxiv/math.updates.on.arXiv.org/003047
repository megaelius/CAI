Blockchain has many benefits including decentralization, availability, persistency, consistency,
anonymity, auditability and accountability, and it also covers a wide spectrum of applications
ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, reputation system, Internet of Things, sharing
economy to public and social services. Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product of Bitcoin
cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger technology through using a trustworthy,
decentralized log of totally ordered transactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain,
it is found that more papers focus on engineering implementation and realization, while little
work has been done on basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov processes, queueing
theory and game models), performance analysis and optimization of blockchain systems. In this
paper, we develop queueing theory of blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation.
To do this, we design a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service stages,
while the two stages are suitable to well express the mining process in the miners pool and the building
of a new blockchain. By using the matrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition
and express three key performance measures: (a) The number of transactions in the queue, (b) the
number of transactions in a block, and (c) the transaction-confirmation time. Finally, We use numerical
examples to verify computability of our theoretical results. Although our queueing model is simple
under exponential or Poisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially
promising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.
