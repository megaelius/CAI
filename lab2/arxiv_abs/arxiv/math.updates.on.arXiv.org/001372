We investigate relationships between two forms of Hilbert-Schmidt two-re[al]bit and two-qubit
"separability functions"--those recently advanced by Lovas and Andai (J. Phys. A 50 [2017] 295303),
and those earlier presented by Slater (J. Phys. A} 40 [2007] 14279). In the Lovas-Andai framework,
the independent variable $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$ is the ratio $\sigma(V)$ of the singular values
of the $2 \times 2$ matrix $V=D_2^{1/2} D_1^{-1/2}$ formed from the two $2 \times 2$ diagonal blocks
($D_1, D_2$) of a $4 \times 4$ density matrix $D$. In the Slater setting, the independent variable
$\mu$ is the diagonal-entry ratio $\sqrt{\frac{\rho_{11} \rho_{44}}{\rho_{22} \rho_{33}}}$--with,
of central importance, $\mu=\varepsilon$ or $\mu=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ when both $D_1$ and
$D_2$ are themselves diagonal. Lovas and Andai established that their two-rebit "separability
function" $\tilde{\chi}_1 (\varepsilon )$ ($\approx \varepsilon$) yields the previously conjectured
Hilbert-Schmidt separability probability of $\frac{29}{64}$. We are able, in the Slater framework
(using cylindrical algebraic decompositions [CAD] to enforce positivity constraints), to reproduce
this result. Further, we newly find its two-qubit (yielding $\frac{8}{33}$), two-quater[nionic]-bit
(yielding $\frac{26}{323}$) and "two-octo[nionic]-bit" (yielding $\frac{44482}{4091349}$)
counterparts. Then, we find a Lovas-Andai "master formula", $\tilde{\chi_d}(\varepsilon)=
\frac{\varepsilon ^d \Gamma (d+1)^3 \,_3\tilde{F}_2\left(-\frac{d}{2},\frac{d}{2},d;\frac{d}{2}+1,\frac{3d}{2}+1;\varepsilon
^2\right)}{\Gamma \left(\frac{d}{2}+1\right)^2}$ encompassing both even and odd values of
$d$. C. Koutschan, then, using his HolonomicFunctions program, develops an order-4 recurrence
satisfied by the predictions of the several formulas, establishing their equivalence.
