We study the non-vanishing gradient-like vector fields v on smooth compact manifolds X with boundary.
We call such fields traversing. The traversally generic vector fields form an open and dense subset
in the space of all traversing vector fields on X. In Theorem 2.2, we show that the trajectory spaces
T(v) of such traversally generic v-flows are Whitney stratified spaces and therefore admit triangulations,
amenable to their natural stratifications. Despite being spaces with singularities, T(v) retain
some residual smooth structure of X. Let F(v) denote the oriented 1-dimensional foliation on X,
produced by a traversing v-flow. With the help of a generic field v, we divide the boundary dX of X into
two complementary compact manifolds, d^+X(v) and d^-X(v). Then we introduce the causality map
C_v: d^+X(v) --> d^-X(v), a distant relative of the Poincare return map. Our main result, Theorem
3.1, claims that, for boundary generic traversing vector fields v, the knowledge of the causality
map C_v allows for a reconstruction of the pair (X, F(v)), up to a homeomorphism \Phi: X \to X which
is the identity on the boundary dX. In other words, for a massive class of ODE's, we show that the topology
of their solutions, satisfing a given boundary value problem, is rigid. We call these results "holographic"
since the (n+1)-dimensional X and the un-parameterized dynamics of the flow on it are captured by
a single correspondece C_v between two n-dimensional screens d^+X(v) and d^-X(v). This holography
of traversing flows has numerous applications to the dynamics of general flows. Some of them are
described in the paper. Others, like geodesic flows on manifolds with boundary, are just outlined.
