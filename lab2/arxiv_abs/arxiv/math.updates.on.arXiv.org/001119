Let $V$ be a highest weight module over a Kac-Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and let conv $V$ denote
the convex hull of its weights. We determine the combinatorial isomorphism type of conv $V$, i.e.
we completely classify the faces and their inclusions. In the special case where $\mathfrak{g}$
is semisimple, this brings closure to a question studied by Cellini-Marietti [IMRN 2015] for the
adjoint representation, and by Khare [J. Algebra 2016; Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2017] for most modules.
The determination of faces of finite-dimensional modules up to the Weyl group action and some of
their inclusions also appears in previous work of Satake [Ann. of Math. 1960], Borel-Tits [IHES
Publ. Math. 1965], Vinberg [Izv. Akad. Nauk 1990], and Casselman [Austral. Math. Soc. 1997]. For
any subset of the simple roots, we introduce a remarkable convex cone which we call the universal
Weyl polyhedron, which controls the convex hulls of all modules parabolically induced from the
corresponding Levi factor. Namely, the combinatorial isomorphism type of the cone stores the classification
of faces for all such highest weight modules, as well as how faces degenerate as the highest weight
gets increasingly singular. To our knowledge, this cone is new in finite and infinite type. We further
answer a question of Michel Brion, by showing that the localization of conv $V$ along a face is always
the convex hull of the weights of a parabolically induced module. Finally, as we determine the inclusion
relations between faces representation-theoretically from the set of weights, without recourse
to convexity, we answer a similar question for highest weight modules over symmetrizable quantum
groups.
