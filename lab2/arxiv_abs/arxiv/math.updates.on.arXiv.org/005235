This article is a summary of the Master's thesis I wrote under the supervision of Prof. Ion Stamatescu
and Prof. James Weatherall as a result of more than a year of research. The original work contained
a bit more than 140 pages, while in the present summary all less relevant topics were shifted to the
appendix such that the main part does not exceed 46 pages to ease the reading. However, the appendix
was kept in order to show which parts were omitted. In the article, a mathematical framework to relate
and compare any classical field theories is constructed. A classical field theory is here understood
to be a theory that can be described by a (possibly non-linear) system of partial differential equations
and thus the notion includes but is not limited to classical (Newtonian) mechanics, hydrodynamics,
electrodynamics, the laws of thermodynamics, special and general relativity, classical Yang-Mills
theory and so on. To construct the mathematical framework, a mathematical category (in the sense
of category theory) in which a versatile comparison becomes possible is sought and the geometric
theory of partial differential equations is used to define what can be understood by a correspondence
between theories and by an intersection of two theories under such a correspondence. This is used
to define in a precise sense when it is meaningful to say that two theories share structure and a procedure
(based on formal integrability) is introduced that permits to decide whether such structure does
in fact exist or not if a correspondence is given. It is described why this framework is useful both
for conceptual and practical purposes and how to apply it. As an example, the theory is applied to
electrodynamics and, among other things, magneto-statics is shown to share structure with a subtheory
of hydrodynamics.
