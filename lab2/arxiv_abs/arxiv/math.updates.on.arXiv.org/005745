Multi-view videos (MVVs) provide immersive viewing experience, at the cost of traffic load increase
for wireless networks. In this paper, we would like to optimize MVV transmission in a multiuser wireless
network by exploiting both natural multicast opportunities and view synthesis-enabled multicast
opportunities. Specifically, we first establish a mathematical model to specify view synthesis
at the server and each user, and characterize its impact on multicast opportunities. This model
is highly nontrivial and fundamentally enables the optimization of view synthesis-based multicast
opportunities. For given video quality requirements of all users, we consider the optimization
of view selection, transmission time and power allocation to minimize the average weighted sum
energy consumption for view transmission and synthesis. In addition, under the energy consumption
constraints at the server and each user respectively, we consider the optimization of view selection,
transmission time and power allocation and video quality selection to maximize the total utility.
These two optimization problems are challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization problems.
For the first problem, we propose an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution with reduced computational
complexity by exploiting optimality properties. For each problem, to reduce computational complexity,
we also propose a low-complexity algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution, using Difference of
Convex (DC) programming. Finally, numerical results show the advantage of the proposed solutions
over existing ones, and demonstrate the importance of the optimization of view synthesis-enabled
multicast opportunities in MVV transmission.
