Let G be a group of permutations of a denumerable set E. The profile of G is the function phi which counts,
for each n, the number phi(n) of orbits of G acting on the n-subsets of E. Counting functions arising
this way, and their associated generating series, form a rich yet apparently strongly constrained
class. In particular, Cameron conjectured in the late seventies that, whenever the profile phi(n)
is bounded by a polynomial -- we say that G is P-oligomorphic --, it is asymptotically equivalent
to a polynomial. In 1985, Macpherson further asked whether the orbit algebra of G -- a graded commutative
algebra invented by Cameron and whose Hilbert function is phi -- is finitely generated. In this paper
we establish a classification of (closed) P-oligomorphic permutation groups in terms of finite
permutation groups with decorated blocks. It follows from the classification that the orbit algebra
of any P-oligomorphic group is isomorphic to (a straightforward quotient of) the invariant ring
of some finite permutation group. This answers positively both Cameron's conjecture and Macpherson's
question. The orbit algebra is in fact Cohen-Macaulay; therefore the generating series of phi is
a rational fraction whose numerator has positive coefficients, while the denominator admits a
combinatorial description. In addition, the classification provides a finite data structure
for encoding closed P-oligomorphic groups. This paves the way for computing with them and enumerating
them as well as for proofs by structural induction. Finally, the relative simplicity of the classification
gives hopes to extend the study to, e.g., the class of (closed) permutations groups with sub-exponential
profile. The proof exploits classical notions from group theory -- notably block systems and their
lattice properties --, commutative algebra, and invariant theory.
