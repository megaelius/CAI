In this paper, we study the lower iteration complexity bounds for finding the saddle point of a strongly
convex and strongly concave saddle point problem: $\min_x\max_yF(x,y)$. We restrict the classes
of algorithms in our investigation to be either pure first-order methods or methods using proximal
mappings. The existing lower bound result for this type of problems is obtained via the framework
of strongly monotone variational inequality problems, which corresponds to the case where the
gradient Lipschitz constants ($L_x, L_y$ and $L_{xy}$) and strong convexity/concavity constants
($\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$) are uniform with respect to variables $x$ and $y$. However, specific to the
min-max saddle point problem these parameters are naturally different. Therefore, one is led to
finding the best possible lower iteration complexity bounds, specific to the min-max saddle point
models. In this paper we present the following results. For the class of pure first-order algorithms,
our lower iteration complexity bound is $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_x}{\mu_x}+\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}+\frac{L_y}{\mu_y}}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$,
where the term $\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}$ explains how the coupling influences the iteration
complexity. Under several special parameter regimes, this lower bound has been achieved by corresponding
optimal algorithms. However, whether or not the bound under the general parameter regime is optimal
remains open. Additionally, for the special case of bilinear coupling problems, given the availability
of certain proximal operators, a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}+1}\cdot\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon})\right)$
is established in this paper, and optimal algorithms have already been developed in the literature.
