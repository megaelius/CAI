Motivated by potential applications to theoretical computer science, in particular those areas
where the Curry-Howard correspondence plays an important role, as well as by the ongoing search
in pure mathematics for feasible approaches to higher category theory, we undertake a detailed
study of a new mathematical abstraction, the generalized category. It is a partially defined monoid
equipped with endomorphism maps defining sources and targets on arbitrary elements, possibly
allowing a proximal behavior with respect to composition. We first present a formal introduction
to the theory of generalized categories. We describe functors, equivalences, natural transformations,
adjoints, and limits in the generalized setting. Next we indicate how the theory of monads extends
to generalized categories. Next, we present a variant of the calculus of deductive systems developed
by Lambek, and give a generalization of the Curry-Howard-Lambek theorem giving an equivalence
between the category of typed lambda-calculi and the category of cartesian closed categories and
exponential-preserving morphisms that leverages the theory of generalized categories. Next,
we develop elementary topos theory in the generalized setting of ideal toposes, utilizing the formalism
developed for the Curry-Howard-Lambek theorem. In particular, we prove that ideal toposes possess
the same Heyting algebra structure and squares of adjoints that ordinary toposes do. Finally, we
develop generalized sheaves, and show that such categories form ideal toposes. We extend Lawvere
and Tierney's theorem relating $j$-sheaves and sheaves in the sense of Grothendieck to the generalized
setting.
