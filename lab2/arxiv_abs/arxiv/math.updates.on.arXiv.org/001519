Chocolate bar games are variants of the CHOMP game in which the goal is to leave your opponent with
the single bitter part of the chocolate. In this paper, we investigate step chocolate bars whose
widths are determined by a fixed function of the horizontal distance from the bitter square. When
the width of chocolate bar is proportional to the distance from the bitter square and the constant
of proportionality is even, the authors have already proved that the Grundy number of this chocolate
bar is $(m-1) \oplus (n-1)$, where $m$ is is the largest width of the chocolate and $n$ is the longest
horizontal distance from the bitter part. This result was published in a mathematics journal(Integers,15,
2015). On the other hand, if the constant of proportionality is odd, the Grundy number of this chocolate
bar is not $(m-1) \oplus (n-1)$. Therefore, it is natural to look for a necessary and sufficient condition
for chocolate bars to have the Grundy number that is equal to $(m-1) \oplus (n-1)$, where $m$ is the
largest width of the chocolate and $n$ is the longest horizontal distance from the bitter part. In
the first part of the present paper, the authors present this necessary and sufficient condition.
Next, we modified the condition that the Grundy number that is equal to $(m-1) \oplus (n-1)$, and
we studied a necessary and sufficient condition for chocolate bars to have Grundy number that is
equal to $((m-1) \oplus (n-1+s))-s$, where $m$ is is the largest width of the chocolate and $n$ is
the longest horizontal distance from the bitter part. We present this necessary and sufficient
condition in the second part of this paper.
