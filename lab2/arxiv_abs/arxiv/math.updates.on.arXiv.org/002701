Our results in this paper are two-fold. First, we consider current fluctuations of the stationary
asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), run for some long time $T$, and show that they are of
order $T^{1 / 3}$ along a characteristic line. Upon scaling by $T^{1 / 3}$, we establish that these
fluctuations converge to the long-time height fluctuations of the stationary KPZ equation, that
is, to the Baik-Rains distribution. This result has long been predicted under the context of KPZ
universality and in particular extends upon a number of results in the field, including the work
of Ferrari and Spohn in 2005 (who established the same result for the TASEP), and the work of Balazs
and Seppalainen in 2010 (who established the $T^{1 / 3}$ scaling for the general ASEP). Second, we
introduce a class of translation-invariant Gibbs measures that characterizes a one-parameter
family of slopes for an arbitrary ferroelectric, symmetric six-vertex model. This family of slopes
corresponds to what is known as the conical singularity (or tricritical point) in the free energy
profile for the ferroelectric six-vertex model. We consider fluctuations of the height function
of this model on a large grid of size $T$ and show that they too are of order $T^{1 / 3}$ along a certain
characteristic line; this confirms a prediction of Bukman and Shore from 1995 stating that the ferroelectric
six-vertex model should exhibit KPZ growth at the conical singularity. Upon scaling the height
fluctuations by $T^{1 / 3}$, we again recover the Baik-Rains distribution in the large $T$ limit.
Recasting this statement in terms of the (asymmetric) stochastic six-vertex model confirms a prediction
of Gwa and Spohn from 1992.
