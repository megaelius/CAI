We present and analyze a model aiming at recovering as dynamical outcomes of tree-grass interactions
the wide range of vegetation physiognomies observable in the savanna biome along rainfall gradients
at regional/continental scales. The model is based on two ordinary differential equations (ODE),
for woody and grass biomass. It is parameterized from literature and retains mathematical tractability,
since we restricted it to the main processes, notably tree-grass asym-metric interactions (either
facilitative or competitive) and the grass-fire feedback. We used a fully qualitative analysis
to derive all possible long term dynamics and express them in a bifur-cation diagram in relation
to mean annual rainfall and fire frequency. We delineated domains of monostability (forest, grassland,
savanna), of bistability (e.g. forest-grassland or forest-savanna) and even tristability. Notably,
we highlighted regions in which two savanna equilibria may be jointly stable (possibly in addition
to forest or grassland). We verified that common knowledge about decreasing woody biomass with
increasing fire frequency is recovered for all levels of rainfall, contrary to previous attempts
using analogous ODE frameworks. Thus, this framework appears able to render more realistic and
diversified outcomes than often thought of. Our model can help figure out the ongoing dynamics of
savanna vegetation in large territories for which local data are sparse or absent. To explore the
bifurcation diagram with different combinations of the model parameters, we have developed a user-friendly
