Polymer 3D-printing has been commercialized rapidly during recent years, however, there remains
a matter of improving the manufacturing speed. Screw extrusion has a strong potential to fasten
the process through simultaneous operation of the filament production and the deposition. This
paper develops a control algorithm for screw extrusion-based 3D printing of thermoplastic materials
through an observer-based output feedback design. We consider the thermodynamic model describing
the time evolution of the temperature profile of an extruded polymer by means of a partial differential
equation (PDE) defined on the time-varying domain. The time evolution of the spatial domain is governed
by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that reflects the dynamics of the position of the phase
change interface between polymer granules and molten polymer deposited as a molten filament. Steady-state
profile of the distributed temperature along the extruder is obtained when the desired setpoint
for the interface position is prescribed. To enhance the feasibility of our previous design, we
develop a PDE observer to estimate the temperature profile via measured values of surface temperature
and the interface position. An output feedback control law considering a cooling mechanism at the
boundary inlet as an actuator is proposed. In extruders the control of raw material temperature
is commonly achieved using preconditioners as part of the inlet feeding mechanism. For some given
screw speeds that correspond to slow and fast operating modes, numerical simulations are conducted
to prove the performance of the proposed controller. The convergence of the interface position
to the desired setpoint is achieved under physically reasonable temperature profiles.
