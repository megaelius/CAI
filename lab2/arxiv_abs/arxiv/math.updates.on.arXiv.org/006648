As software may be used by multiple users, caching popular software at the wireless edge has been
considered to save computation and communications resources for mobile edge computing (MEC).
However, fetching uncached software from the core network and multicasting popular software to
users have so far been ignored. Thus, existing design is incomplete and less practical. In this paper,
we propose a joint caching, computation and communications mechanism which involves software
fetching, caching and multicasting, as well as task input data uploading, task executing (with
non-negligible time duration) and computation result downloading, and mathematically characterize
it. Then, we optimize the joint caching, offloading and time allocation policy to minimize the weighted
sum energy consumption subject to the caching and deadline constraints. The problem is a challenging
two-timescale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, and is NP-hard in general.
We convert it into an equivalent convex MINLP problem by using some appropriate transformations
and propose two low-complexity algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions of the original non-convex
MINLP problem. Specifically, the first suboptimal solution is obtained by solving a relaxed convex
problem using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then rounding
its optimal solution properly. The second suboptimal solution is proposed by obtaining a stationary
point of an equivalent difference of convex (DC) problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure
(Penalty-CCP) and ADMM. Finally, by numerical results, we show that the proposed solutions outperform
existing schemes and reveal their advantages in efficiently utilizing storage, computation and
communications resources.
