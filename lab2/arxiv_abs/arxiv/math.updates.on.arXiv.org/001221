In $n \geq 1$ spatial dimensions, we study the Cauchy problem for a quasilinear transport equation
coupled to a quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic subsystem of a rather general type. For an open set
(relative to a suitable Sobolev topology) of regular initial data that are close to the data of a simple
plane wave, we give a sharp, constructive proof of shock formation in which the transport variable
remains bounded but its first-order Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives blow up in finite
time. Moreover, we prove that the singularity does not propagate into the symmetric hyperbolic
variables: they and their first-order Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives remain bounded,
even though they interact with the transport variable all the way up to its singularity. The formation
of the singularity is tied to the finite-time degeneration, relative to the Cartesian coordinates,
of a system of geometric coordinates adapted to the characteristics of the transport operator.
Two crucial features of the proof are that relative to the geometric coordinates, all solution variables
remain smooth, and that the finite-time degeneration coincides with the intersection of the characteristics.
Compared to prior shock formation results in more than one spatial dimension, in which the blowup
occurred in solutions to wave equations, the main new features of the present work are: i) we develop
a theory of nonlinear geometric optics for transport operators, which is compatible with the coupling
and which allows us to implement a quasilinear geometric vectorfield method, even though the regularity
properties of the corresponding eikonal function are less favorable compared to the wave equation
case and ii) we allow for a full quasilinear coupling, i.e., the principal coefficients in all equations
are allowed to depend on all solution variables.
