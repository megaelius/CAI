Milliken's tree theorem is a deep result in combinatorics that generalizes a vast number of other
results in the subject, most notably Ramsey's theorem and its many variants and consequences. Motivated
by a question of Dobrinen, we initiate the study of Milliken's tree theorem from the point of view
of computability theory. Our advance here stems from a careful analysis of the Halpern-La\"{u}chli
theorem which shows that it can be carried out effectively (i.e., that it is computably true). We
use this as the basis of a new inductive proof of Milliken's tree theorem that permits us to gauge its
effectivity in turn. The principal outcome of this is a comprehensive classification of the computable
content of Milliken's tree theorem. We apply our analysis also to several well-known applications
of Milliken's tree theorem, namely Devlin's theorem, a partition theorem for Rado graphs, and a
generalized version of the so-called tree theorem of Chubb, Hirst, and McNicholl. These are all
certain kinds of extensions of Ramsey's theorem for different structures, namely the rational
numbers, the Rado graph, and perfect binary trees, respectively. We obtain a number of new results
about how these principles relate to Milliken's tree theorem and to each other, in terms of both their
computability-theoretic and combinatorial aspects. We identify again the familiar dichotomy
between coding the halting problem or not based on the size of instance, but this is more subtle here
owing to the more complicated underlying structures, particularly in the case of Devlin's theorem.
We also establish new structural Ramsey-theoretic properties of the Rado graph theorem and the
generalized Chubb-Hirst-McNicholl tree theorem using Zucker's notion of big Ramsey structure.
