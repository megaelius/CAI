Mean field models are a popular tool used to analyse load balancing policies. In some exceptional
cases the response time distribution of the mean field limit has an explicit form. In most cases it
can be computed using either a recursion or a differential equation (for exponential job sizes with
mean one). In this paper we study the value of the mean response time $E[R_\lambda]$ as the arrival
rate $\lambda$ approaches $1$ (i.e. the system gets close to instability). As $E[R_\lambda]$ diverges
to infinity, we scale with $-\log(1-\lambda)$ and present a method to compute the limit $\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow
1^-}-E[R_\lambda]/\log(1-\lambda)$. This limit has been previously determined for SQ(d) and
LL(d), two well-known policies that assign an incoming job to a server with either the shortest queue
or least work left among $d$ randomly selected servers. However, the derivation of the result for
SQ(d) relied on the closed form representation of the mean response time and does not seem to generalize
well, moreover the proof for LL(d) is incomplete. In contrast, we present a general result that holds
for any policy for which the associated recursion or differential equation satisfies a list of criteria.
For SQ(d) and LL(d) these criteria are trivially verified. We apply our method to SQ(d,K) resp LL(d,K)
with exponential job sizes of mean one. For these policies, jobs arrive in batches of size $K$ and
join the $K$ servers with the shortest queue resp least amount of work left. For SQ(d,K) we obtain
$\frac{1}{\log(d/K)}$ as limiting value, while for LL(d,K) we find the limit to be equal to $\frac{K}{d-K}$.
We further analyse a policy where SQ(d_i) resp LL($d_i$) is used with probability $p_i$. For the
shortest queue variant, we obtain the limit $\frac{1}{\log\left(\sum_{i=1}^np_id_i\right)}$,
while for the least loaded variant, we obtain $\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^np_id_i-1}$.
