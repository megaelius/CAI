The assortment problem in revenue management is the problem of deciding which subset of products
to offer to consumers in order to maximise revenue. A simple and natural strategy is to select the
best assortment out of all those that are constructed by fixing a threshold revenue $\pi$ and then
choosing all products with revenue at least $\pi$. This is known as the revenue-ordered assortments
strategy. In this paper we study the approximation guarantees provided by revenue-ordered assortments
when customers are rational in the following sense: the probability of selecting a specific product
from the set being offered cannot increase if the set is enlarged. This rationality assumption,
known as regularity, is satisfied by almost all discrete choice models considered in the revenue
management and choice theory literature, and in particular by random utility models. The bounds
we obtain are tight and improve on recent results in that direction, such as for the Mixed Multinomial
Logit model by Rusmevichientong et al. (2014). An appealing feature of our analysis is its simplicity,
as it relies only on the regularity condition. We also draw a connection between assortment optimisation
and two pricing problems called unit demand envy-free pricing and Stackelberg minimum spanning
tree: These problems can be restated as assortment problems under discrete choice models satisfying
the regularity condition, and moreover revenue-ordered assortments correspond then to the well-studied
uniform pricing heuristic. When specialised to that setting, the general bounds we establish for
revenue-ordered assortments match and unify the best known results on uniform pricing.
