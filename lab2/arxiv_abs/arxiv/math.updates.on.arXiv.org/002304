Based on the author's previous work on the Jacobi identity for twisted relative vertex operator
algebras and modules and on the generating function identities for affine Lie algebras, we interpret
the second difference sequence of the sequence of the number of integer partitions with distinct
parts (the strict partitions) as the sequence of the strict partitions of n with at least three parts,
the three largest parts consecutive, and the smallest part at least two. The name butterfly describes
both the sequence's interpretation and the underlying bijection between the set of strict partitions
of positive integers m with the two largest parts consecutive, and a subset of the same kind of strict
partitions of m+1. Using the cyclotomic polynomials 1-x and 1+x+x^2, we compute generating function
identities o the butterfly sequence and related sequences both as infinite products and as series
filtered by the number of parts of the corresponding partitions, and we see that the number of partitions
of positive integers n with odd parts greater than or equal to 5 is the sum of three consecutive terms
of the butterfly sequence. We also determine a subtler merging and splitting construction of the
butterfly sequence as a sequence of some of the partitions with odd parts larger or equal to 3, and
we offer a related detailed interpretation of the butterfly sequence as a sequence of what we define
as generalized pentagonal, pentagonal with domino, and non-pentagonal butterfly partitions.
Finally, Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem and a slightly different specialization of the Jacobi
triple product lead to recursive algorithms to compute the butterfly sequence and related sequences
using pentagonal number sequences and the series of triangular powers.
