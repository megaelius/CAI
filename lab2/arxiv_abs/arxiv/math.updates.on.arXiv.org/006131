We investigate fine global properties of nonnegative, integrable solutions to the Cauchy problem
for the Fast Diffusion Equation with weights (WFDE) $u_t=|x|^\gamma\mathrm{div}\left(|x|^{-\beta}\nabla
u^m\right)$ posed on $(0,+\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\ge 3$, in the so-called good fast
diffusion range $m_c<m<1$, within the natural range of parameters $\gamma,\beta$. It is a natural
question to ask in which sense such solutions behave like the Barenblatt $\mathfrak{B}$ (fundamental
solution): for instance, asymptotic convergence, i.e. $\|u(t)-\mathfrak{B}(t)\|_{{\rm L}^p(\mathbb{R}^d)}\xrightarrow[]{t\to\infty}0$,
is well known for all $1\le p\le \infty$, while only few partial results tackle a finer analysis of
the tail behaviour. We characterize the maximal set of data $\mathcal{X}\subset{\rm L}^1_+(\mathbb{R}^d)$
that produces solutions which are pointwise trapped between two Barenblatt (Global Harnack Principle),
and uniformly converge in relative error (REC), i.e. ${\rm d}_\infty(u(t))=\|u(t)/\mathcal{B}(t)-1\|_{{\rm
L}^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)}\xrightarrow[]{t\to\infty}0$. Such characterization is in terms
of a integral condition on $u(t=0)$. To our best knowledge, analogous issues for the linear heat
equation $m=1$, do not possess such clear answers, only partial results. Our characterizations
are new also for the classical, non-weighted, FDE. We are able to provide minimal rates of convergence
to $\mathcal{B}$ in different norms. Such rates are almost optimal in the non weighted case, and
become optimal for radial solutions. To complete the panorama, we show that solutions with data
in ${\rm L}^1_+(\mathbb{R}^d)\setminus\mathcal{X}$, preserve the same ``fat'' spatial tail
for all times, hence REC fails and ${\rm d}_\infty(u(t))\!=\!\infty$, even if $\|u(t)-\mathcal{B}(t)\|_{{\rm
L}^1(\mathbb{R}^d)}\xrightarrow[]{t\to\infty}0$.
