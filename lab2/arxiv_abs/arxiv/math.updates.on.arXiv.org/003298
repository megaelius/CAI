A significant burden on wireless networks is brought by the uploading of user-generated contents
to the Internet by means of applications such as the social media. To cope with this mobile data tsunami,
we develop a novel MIMO network architecture with randomly located base stations (BSs) a large number
of antennas employing cache-enabled \textit{uplink} transmission. In particular, we formulate
a scenario, where the users upload their content to their strongest base stations (BSs), which are
Poisson point process (PPP) distributed. In addition, the BSs, exploiting the benefits of massive
MIMO, upload their contents to the core network by means of a finite-rate backhaul. After proposing
the caching policies, where we propose the {modified} von Mises distribution as the popularity
distribution function, we derive the outage probability and the average delivery rate by taking
advantage of tools from the deterministic equivalent (DE) and stochastic geometry analyses. Numerical
results investigate the realistic performance gains of the proposed heterogeneous cache-enabled
uplink on the network in terms of cardinal operating parameters. For example, insights regarding
the BSs storage size are exposed. Moreover, the impacts of the key parameters such the file popularity
distribution, and the target bitrate are investigated. Specifically, the outage probability
decreases if the storage size is increased, while the average delivery rate increases. In addition,
the concentration parameter, defining the number of files stored at the intermediate nodes (popularity),
affects directly the proposed metrics. A higher target rate results in higher outage because fewer
users obey this constraint. Also, we demonstrate that a denser network decreases the outage and
increases the delivery rate. Hence, the introduction of caching at the uplink of the system design
ameliorates the network performance.
