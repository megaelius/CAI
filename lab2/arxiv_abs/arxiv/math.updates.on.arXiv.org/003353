In this paper, we study random Blaschke products, acting on the unit circle, and consider the cocycle
of Perron-Frobenius operators acting on Banach spaces of analytic functions on an annulus. We completely
describe the Lyapunov spectrum of these cocycles. As a corollary, we obtain a simple random Blaschke
product system where the Perron-Frobenius cocycle has infinitely many distinct Lyapunov exponents,
but where arbitrarily small natural perturbations cause a complete collapse of the Lyapunov spectrum,
except for the exponent 0 associated with the absolutely continuous invariant measure. That is,
under perturbations, the Lyapunov exponents become 0 with multiplicity 1, and $-\infty$ with infinite
multiplicity. This is superficially similar to the finite-dimensional phenomenon, discovered
by Bochi \cite{Bochi-thesis}, that away from the uniformly hyperbolic setting, small perturbations
can lead to a collapse of the Lyapunov spectrum to zero. In this paper, however, the cocycle and its
perturbation are explicitly described; and further, the mechanism for collapse is quite different.
We study stability of the Perron-Frobenius cocycles arising from general random Blaschke products.
We give a necessary and sufficient criterion for stability of the Lyapunov spectrum in terms of the
derivative of the random Blaschke product at its random fixed point, and use this to show that an open
dense set of Blaschke product cocycles have hyperbolic Perron-Frobenius cocycles. In the final
part, we prove a relationship between the Lyapunov spectrum of a single cocycle acting on two different
Banach spaces, allowing us to draw conclusions for the same cocycles acting on $C^r$ functions spaces.
