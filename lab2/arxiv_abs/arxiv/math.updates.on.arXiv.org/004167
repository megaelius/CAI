Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication with large antenna arrays is a promising technique to enable
extremely high data rates due to the large available bandwidth in mmWave frequency bands. In addition,
given the knowledge of an optimal directional beamforming vector, large antenna arrays have been
shown to overcome both the severe signal attenuation in mmWave as well as the interference problem.
However, fundamental limits on achievable learning rate of an optimal beamforming vector remain.
This paper considers the problem of adaptive and sequential optimization of the beamforming vectors
during the initial access phase of communication. With a single-path channel model, the problem
is reduced to actively learning the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of the signal sent from the user to the
Base Station (BS). Drawing on the recent results in the design of a hierarchical beamforming codebook
[1], sequential measurement dependent noisy search strategies [2], and active learning from an
imperfect labeler [3], an adaptive and sequential alignment algorithm is proposed. An upper bound
on the expected search time of the proposed algorithm is derived via Extrinsic Jensen-Shannon Divergence.
which demonstrates that the search time of the proposed algorithm asymptotically matches the performance
of the noiseless bisection search up to a constant factor. Furthermore, the upper bound shows that
the acquired AoA error probability decays exponentially fast with the search time with an exponent
that is a decreasing function of the acquisition rate. Numerically, the proposed algorithm is compared
with prior work where a significant improvement of the system communication rate is observed. Most
notably, in the relevant regime of low (-10dB to 5dB) raw SNR, this establishes the first practically
viable solution for initial access and, hence, the first demonstration of stand-alone mmWave communication
