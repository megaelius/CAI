Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) pertinent to some emergent low energy phenomena of
condensed matter lattice models in 2+1 and 3+1D are explored. Many of our field theories are highly-interacting
without free quadratic analogs. Some of our bosonic TQFTs can be regarded as the continuum field
theory formulation of Dijkgraaf-Witten twisted discrete gauge theories. Other bosonic TQFTs
beyond the Dijkgraaf-Witten description and all fermionic spin TQFTs are either higher-form gauge
theories where particles must have strings attached, or fermionic discrete gauge theories obtained
by gauging the fermionic Symmetry-Protected Topological states (SPTs). We calculate both Abelian
and non-Abelian braiding statistics data of anyon particle and string excitations, where the statistics
data can one-to-one characterize the underlying topological orders of TQFTs. We derive path integral
expectation values of links formed by line and surface operators in the TQFTs. The acquired link
invariants include not only the Aharonov-Bohm linking number, but also Milnor triple linking number
in 2+1D, triple and quadruple linking numbers of surfaces, and intersection number of surfaces
in 3+1D. We also construct new spin TQFTs with the corresponding knot/link invariants of Arf(-Brown-Kervaire),
Sato-Levine and others. We propose a new relation between the fermionic SPT partition function
and Rokhlin invariant. We can use these invariants and other observables, including ground state
degeneracy, reduced modular $\mathcal{S}^{xy}$ and $\mathcal{T}^{xy}$ matrices, and the partition
function on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ manifold, to identify all $\mathbb{Z}_8$ classes of 2+1D gauged $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Ising-symmetric
$\mathbb{Z}_2^f$-fermionic Topological Superconductors (TSC, realized by stacking layers
of a pair of $p+ip$ and $p-ip$ SC, where boundary supports non-chiral Majorana-Weyl modes) with
continuum spin-TQFTs.
