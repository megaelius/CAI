The current series of three papers is concerned with the asymptotic dynamics in the following chemotaxis
model $$\partial_tu=\Delta u-\chi\nabla(u\nabla v)+u(a(x,t)-ub(x,t))\ ,\ 0=\Delta v-\lambda
v+\mu u \ \ (1)$$where $\chi, \lambda, \mu$ are positive constants, $a(x,t)$ and $b(x,t)$ are positive
and bounded. In the first of the series, we investigate the persistence and asymptotic spreading.
Under some explicit condition on the parameters, we show that (1) has a unique nonnegative time global
classical solution $(u(x,t;t_0,u_0),v(x,t;t_0,u_0))$ with $u(x,t_0;t_0,u_0)=u_0(x)$ for
every $t_0\in R$ and every $u_0\in C^{b}_{\rm unif}(R^N)$, $u_0\geq 0$. Next we show the pointwise
persistence phenomena in the sense that, for any solution $(u(x,t;t_0,u_0),v(x,t;t_0,u_0))$
of (1) with strictly positive initial function $u_0$, then$$0<\inf_{t_0\in R, t\geq 0}u(x,t+t_0;t_0,u_0)\le\sup_{t_0\in
R, t\geq 0} u(x,t+t_0;t_0,u_0)<\infty$$and show the uniform persistence phenomena in the sense
that there are $0<m<M$ such that for any strictly positive initial function $u_0$, there is $T(u_0)>0$
such that$$m\le u(x,t+t_0;t_0,u_0)\le M\ \forall\,t\ge T(u_0),\ x\in R^N.$$We then discuss
the spreading properties of solutions to (1) with compactly supported initial and prove that there
are positive constants $0<c_{-}^{*}\le c_{+}^{*}<\infty$ such that for every $t_0\in R$ and every
$u_0\in C^b_{\rm unif}(R^N), u_0\ge 0$ with nonempty compact support, we have that$$\lim_{t\to\infty}\sup_{|x|\ge
ct}u(x,t+t_0;t_0,u_0)=0,\ \forall c>c_+^*,$$and$$\liminf_{t\to\infty}\sup_{|x|\le ct}u(x,t+t_0;t_0,u_0)>0,
\ \forall 0<c<c_-^*.$$We also discuss the spreading properties of solutions to (1) with front-like
initial functions. In the second and third of the series, we will study the existence, uniqueness,
and stability of strictly positive entire solutions and the existence of transition fronts, respectively.
