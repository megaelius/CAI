The purpose of this paper is to introduce Liouville hypersurfaces in contact manifolds, which generalize
ribbons of Legendrian graphs and pages of supporting open books. Liouville hypersurfaces are used
to define a gluing operation for contact manifolds called the Liouville connect sum. Performing
this operation on a contact manifold $(M, \xi)$ gives an exact -- and in many cases, Weinstein -- cobordism
whose concave boundary is $(M, \xi)$ and whose convex boundary is the surgered manifold. These cobordisms
are used to establish the existence of ``fillability'' and ``non-vanishing contact homology''
monoids in symplectomorphism groups of Liouville domains, study the symplectic fillability of
a family of contact manifolds which fiber over the circle, associate cobordisms to certain branched
coverings of contact manifolds, and construct exact symplectic cobordisms that do not admit Weinstein
structures. The Liouville connect sum generalizes the Weinstein handle attachment and is used
to extend the definition of contact $(1/k)$-surgery along Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds
to contact $(1/k)$-surgery along Legendrian spheres in contact manifolds of arbitrary dimension.
We use contact surgery to construct exotic contact structures on $5$- and $13$-dimensional spheres
after establishing that $S^{2}$ and $S^{6}$ are the only spheres along which generalized Dehn twists
smoothly square to the identity mapping. The exoticity of these contact structures implies that
Dehn twists along $S^{2}$ and $S^{6}$ do not symplectically square to the identity, generalizing
a theorem of Seidel. A similar argument shows that the $(2n+1)$-dimensional contact manifold determined
by an open book whose page is $(T^{*}S^{n}, -\lambda_{can})$ and whose monodromy is any negative
power of a symplectic Dehn twist is not exactly fillable.
