We develop a method to study the structure of the common part of the boundaries of disjoint and possibly
non-complementary time-varying domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n \geq 2$, at the points of mutual
absolute continuity of their respective caloric measures. Our set of techniques, which is based
on parabolic tangent measures, allows us to tackle the following problems: 1) Let $\Omega_1$ and
$\Omega_2$ be disjoint domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n \geq 2$, which are quasi-regular for
the heat equation and regular for the adjoint heat equation, and their complements satisfy a mild
non-degeneracy hypothesis on the set $E$ of mutual absolute continuity of the associated caloric
measures $\omega_i$ with poles at $\bar{p}_i=(p_i,t_i)\in\Omega_i$, $i=1,2$. Then, we obtain
a parabolic analogue of the results of Kenig, Preiss, and Toro, i.e., we show that the parabolic Hausdorff
dimension of $\omega_1|_E$ is $n+1$ and the tangent measures of $\omega_1$ at $\omega_1$-a.e.
point of $E$ are equal to a constant multiple of the parabolic $(n+1)$-Hausdorff measure restricted
to hyperplanes containing a line parallel to the time-axis. 2) If, additionally, $\omega_1$ and
$\omega_2$ are doubling, $\log \frac{d\omega_2|_E}{d\omega_1|_E} \in VMO(\omega_1|_E)$,
and $E$ is relatively open in the support of $\omega_1$, then their tangent measures at {\it every}
point of $E$ are caloric measures associated with adjoint caloric polynomials. As a corollary we
obtain that in complementary $\delta$-Reifenberg flat domains, if $\delta$ is small enough and
$\log \frac{d\omega_2}{d\omega_1} \in VMO(\omega_1)$, then $\Omega_1 \cap \{t<t_2\}$ is vanishing
Reifenberg flat. This generalizes results of Kenig and Toro for the Laplacian. 3) We establish a
parabolic version of a theorem of Tsirelson about triple-points for harmonic measure.
