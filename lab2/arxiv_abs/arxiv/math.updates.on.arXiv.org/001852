Neural mass models are ubiquitous in large scale brain modelling. At the node level they are written
in terms of a set of ODEs with a nonlinearity that is typically a sigmoidal shape. Using structural
data from brain atlases they may be connected into a network to investigate the emergence of functional
dynamic states, such as synchrony. With the simple restriction of the classic sigmoidal nonlinearity
to a piecewise linear caricature we show that the famous Wilson-Cowan neural mass model can be analysed
at both the node and network level. The construction of periodic orbits at the node level is achieved
by patching together matrix exponential solutions, and stability is determined using Floquet
theory. For networks with interactions described by circulant matrices, we show that the stability
of the synchronous state can be determined in terms of a low-dimensional Floquet problem parameterised
by the eigenvalues of the interaction matrix. This network Floquet problem is readily solved using
linear algebra, to predict the onset of spatio-temporal network patterns arising from a synchronous
instability. We consider the case of a discontinuous choice for the node nonlinearity, namely the
replacement of the sigmoid by a Heaviside nonlinearity. This gives rise to a continuous-time switching
network. At the node level this allows for the existence of unstable sliding periodic orbits, which
we construct. The stability of a periodic orbit is now treated with a modification of Floquet theory
to treat the evolution of small perturbations through switching manifolds via saltation matrices.
At the network level the stability analysis of the synchronous state is considerably more challenging.
Here we report on the use of ideas originally developed for the study of Glass networks to treat the
stability of periodic network states in neural mass models with discontinuous interactions.
