A correspondence exists between affine tropical varieties and algebraic objects, following the
classical Zariski correspondence between irreducible affine varieties and the prime spectrum
of the coordinate algebra in affine algebraic geometry. Although in this context the natural analog
of the polynomial ring over a field is the polynomial semiring over a semifield (without a zero element),
one obtains homomorphic images of coordinate algebras via congruences rather than ideals, which
complicates the algebraic theory considerably. In this paper, we pass to the semifield $F(\lambda_1,
\dots, \lambda_n)$ of fractions of the polynomial semiring, for which there already exists a well
developed theory of kernels, which are normal convex subgroups; this approach enables us to switch
the structural roles of addition and multiplication and makes available much of the extensive theory
of chains of homomorphisms of groups, including the Jordan-Holder theory. The parallel of the zero
set now is the 1-set. These notions are refined in the language of supertropical algebra to $\nu$-kernels
and $1^\nu$-sets, lending more precision to the theory. In analogy to Hilbert's celebrated Nullstellensatz
which provides a correspondence between radical ideals and zero sets, we develop a correspondence
between $1^\nu$-sets and a well-studied class of $\nu$-kernels of the rational semifield called
polars, originating from the theory of lattice-ordered groups. This correspondence becomes simpler
and more applicable when restricted to a special kind of kernel, called principal, intersected
with the kernel generated by $F$. We utilize this theory to study tropical roots in tropical geometry.
