In this paper, we study the longtime asymptotic behavior of a phase separation process occurring
in a three-dimensional domain containing a fluid flow of given velocity. This process is modeled
by a viscous convective Cahn-Hilliard system, which consists of two nonlinearly coupled second-order
partial differential equations for the unknown quantities, the chemical potential and an order
parameter representing the scaled density of one of the phases. In contrast to other contributions,
in which zero Neumann boundary conditions were are assumed for both the chemical potential and the
order parameter, we consider the case of dynamic boundary conditions, which model the situation
when another phase transition takes place on the boundary. The phase transition processes in the
bulk and on the boundary are driven by free energies functionals that may be nondifferentiable and
have derivatives only in the sense of (possibly set-valued) subdifferentials. For the resulting
initial-boundary value system of Cahn-Hilliard type, general well-posedness results have been
established in a recent contribution by the same authors. In the present paper, we investigate the
asymptotic behavior of the solutions as times approaches infinity. More precisely, we study the
$\omega$-limit (in a suitable topology) of every solution trajectory. Under the assumptions that
the viscosity coefficients are strictly positive and that at least one of the underlying free energies
is differentiable, we prove that the $\omega$-limit is meaningful and that all of its elements are
solutions to the corresponding stationary system, where the component representing the chemical
potential is a constant.
