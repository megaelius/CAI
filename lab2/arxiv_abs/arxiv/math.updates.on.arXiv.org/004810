Recently, several papers have considered a nonlinear analogue of Fourier series in signal analysis,
referred to as either nonlinear phase unwinding or adaptive Fourier decomposition. In these processes,
a signal is represented as the real component of a complex function $F: \partial\mathbb{D}\to \mathbb{C}$,
and by performing an iterative method to obtain a sequence of Blaschke decompositions, the signal
can be approximated using only a few terms. To better understand the convergence of these methods,
the study of Blaschke decompositions on weighted Hardy spaces was studied by Coifman and Steinerberger,
under the assumption that the complex valued function $F$ has an analytic extension to $\mathbb{D}_{1+\epsilon}$
for some $\epsilon>0$. This provided bounds on weighted Hardy norms involving a function and its
Blaschke decomposition. That work also noted that in many examples, the nonlinear unwinding series
of a function converges at an exponential rate to the original signal, which when coupled with an
efficient algorithm to perform a Blaschke decomposition, has lead to a new and efficient way to approximate
signals. In this work, we continue the study of Blaschke decompositions on weighted Hardy Spaces
for functions in the larger space $\mathcal{H}^2(\mathbb{D})$ under the assumption that the function
has finitely many roots in $\mathbb{D}$. By studying the growth rate of the weights, we improve the
bounds provided by Coifman and Steinerberger. This provides us with new insights into Blaschke
decompositions on classical function spaces including the Hardy-Sobolev spaces and weighted
Bergman spaces. Further, we state a sufficient condition on the weights for our improved bounds
to hold for any function in the Hardy space, $\mathcal{H}^2(\mathbb{D})$. These results may help
to better explain why the exponential convergence of the unwinding series is seen in many numerical
examples.
