This article gives a class of Nullstellens\"atze for noncommutative polynomials. The singularity
set of a noncommutative polynomial $f=f(x_1,\dots,x_g)$ is $Z(f)=(Z_n(f))_n$, where $Z_n(f)=\{X
\in M_n^g: \det f(X) = 0\}.$ The first main theorem of this article shows that the irreducible factors
of $f$ are in a natural bijective correspondence with irreducible components of $Z_n(f)$ for every
sufficiently large $n$. With each polynomial $h$ in $x$ and $x^*$ one also associates its real singularity
set $Z^{re}(h)=\{X: \det h(X,X^*)=0\}$. A polynomial $f$ which depends on $x$ alone (no $x^*$ variables)
will be called analytic. The main Nullstellensatz proved here is as follows: for analytic $f$ but
for $h$ dependent on possibly both $x$ and $x^*$, the containment $Z(f) \subseteq Z^{re}(h)$ is
equivalent to each factor of $f$ being "stably associated" to a factor of $h$ or of $h^*$. For perspective,
classical Hilbert type Nullstellens\"atze typically apply only to analytic polynomials $f,h
$, while real Nullstellens\"atze typically require adjusting the functions by sums of squares
of polynomials (sos). Since the above "algebraic certificate" does not involve a sos, it seems justified
to think of this as the natural determinantal Hilbert Nullstellensatz. An earlier paper of the authors
(Adv. Math. 331 (2018) 589-626) obtained such a theorem for special classes of analytic polynomials
$f$ and $h$. This paper requires few hypotheses and hopefully brings this type of Nullstellensatz
to near final form. Finally, the paper gives a Nullstellensatz for zeros $V(f)=\{X: f(X,X^*)=0\}$
of a hermitian polynomial $f$, leading to a strong Positivstellensatz for quadratic free semialgebraic
sets by the use of a slack variable.
