In this paper, we propose using mobile nanosensors (MNSs) for early stage anomaly detection. For
concreteness, we focus on the detection of cancer cells located in a particular region of a blood
vessel. These cancer cells produce and emit special molecules, so-called biomarkers, which are
symptomatic for the presence of anomaly, into the cardiovascular system. Detection of cancer biomarkers
with conventional blood tests is difficult in the early stages of a cancer due to the very low concentration
of the biomarkers in the samples taken. However, close to the cancer cells, the concentration of
the cancer biomarkers is high. Hence, detection is possible if a sensor with the ability to detect
these biomarkers is placed in the vicinity of the cancer cells. Therefore, in this paper, we study
the use of MNSs that are injected at a suitable injection site and can move through the blood vessels
of the cardiovascular system, which potentially contain cancer cells. These MNSs can be activated
by the biomarkers close to the cancer cells, where the biomarker concentration is sufficiently
high. Eventually, the MNSs are collected by a fusion center (FC) where their activation levels are
read and exploited to declare the presence of anomaly. We analytically derive the biomarker concentration
as well as the probability mass function of the MNSs' activation levels and validate the obtained
results via particle-based simulations. Then, we derive the optimal decision rule for the FC regarding
the presence of anomaly assuming that the entire network is known at the FC. Finally, for the FC, we
propose a simple sum detector that does not require knowledge of the network topology. Our simulations
reveal that while the optimal detector achieves a higher performance than the sum detector, both
proposed detectors significantly outperform a benchmark scheme that used fixed nanosensors at
the FC.
