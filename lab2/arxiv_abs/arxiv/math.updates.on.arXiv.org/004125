This paper develops boundary control for freeway traffic with a downstream bottleneck. Traffic
on a freeway segment with capacity drop at outlet of the segment is a common phenomenon leading to
traffic bottleneck problem. The capacity drop can be caused by lane-drop, hills, tunnel, bridge
or curvature on the road. If incoming traffic flow remains unchanged, traffic congestion forms
upstream of the bottleneck due to outgoing traffic overflowing its capacity. Therefore, it is important
for us to regulate the incoming traffic flow of the segment so that the outgoing traffic at the bottleneck
can be discharged with the maximum flow rate. Traffic densities on the freeway segment are described
with Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) macroscopic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model.
To prevent the traffic congestion forming upstream of the bottleneck, incoming flow at the inlet
of the freeway segment is controlled so that the optimal density could be achieved to maximize the
outgoing flow and not to surpass the capacity at outlet. The density and traffic flow relation, described
with fundamental diagram, is assumed to be unknown at the bottleneck area. We tackle this problem
using Extremum Seeking (ES) Control with delay compensation for LWR PDE. ES control, a non-model
based approach for real-time optimization, is adopted to find the optimal density for the unknown
fundamental diagram. A predictor feedback control design is proposed to compensate the delay effect
of traffic dynamics in the freeway segment. In the end, simulation results validate a desired performance
of the controller on the nonlinear LWR model with an unknown fundamental diagram.
