We study the existence of whiskered tori in a family $f_\mu$ of conformally symplectic maps depending
on parameters $\mu$. Whiskered tori are tori on which the motion is a rotation, but they have as many
expanding/contracting directions as allowed by the preservation of the geometric structure.
Our main result is formulated in an "a-posteriori" format. We fix $\omega$ satisfying Diophantine
conditions. We assume that we are given 1) a value of the parameter $\mu_0$, 2) an embedding of the
torus $K_0$ into the phase space, approximately invariant under $f_{\mu_0}$ in the sense that $f_{\mu_0}
\circ K_0 - K_0 \circ T_\omega$ is small, 3) a splitting of the tangent space at the range of $K_0$,
into three bundles which are approximately invariant under $D f_{\mu_0}$ and such that the derivative
satisfies "rate conditions" on each of the components. Then, if some non-degeneracy conditions
are satisfied, we show that there is another parameter $\mu_\infty$, an embedding $K_\infty$ and
splittings close to the original ones which are invariant under $f_{\mu_\infty}$. We also bound
$|\mu_\infty - \mu_0|$, $\|K_\infty - K_0 \|$ and the distance of the initial and final splittings
in terms of the initial error. The proof of the main theorem consists in describing an iterative process
that takes advantage of cancellations coming from the geometry. Then, we show that the process converges
to a true solution when started from an approximate enough solution. The iterative process leads
to an efficient algorithm that is quite practical to implement. As an application, we study the singular
problem of effects of small dissipation on whiskered tori. We develop formal expansions in the perturbative
parameter and use them as input for the a-posteriori theorem. This allows to obtain lower bounds
for the domain of analyticity of the tori as function of the perturbative parameter.
