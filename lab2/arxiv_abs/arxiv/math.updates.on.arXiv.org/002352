The question of continuous-versus-discrete information representation in the brain is a fundamental
yet unresolved physiological question. Historically, most analyses assume a continuous representation
without considering the alternative possibility of a discrete representation. Our work explores
the plausibility of both representations, and answers the question from a communications engineering
perspective. Drawing on the well-established Shannon's communications theory, we posit that
information in the brain is represented in a discrete form. Using a computer simulation, we show
that information cannot be communicated reliably between neurons using a continuous representation,
due to the presence of noise; neural information has to be in a discrete form. In addition, we designed
3 (human) behavioral experiments on probability estimation and analyzed the data using a novel
discrete (quantized) model of probability. Under a discrete model of probability, two distinct
probabilities (say, 0.57 and 0.58) are treated indifferently. We found that data from all participants
were better fit to discrete models than continuous ones. Furthermore, we re-analyzed the data from
a published (human) behavioral study on intertemporal choice using a novel discrete (quantized)
model of intertemporal choice. Under such a model, two distinct time delays (say, 16 days and 17 days)
are treated indifferently. We found corroborating results, showing that data from all participants
were better fit to discrete models than continuous ones. In summary, all results reported here support
our discrete hypothesis of information representation in the brain, which signifies a major demarcation
from the current understanding of the brain's physiology.
