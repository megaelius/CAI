The aim of these notes, originally intended as an appendix to a book on the foundations of equivariant
cohomology, is to set up the formalism of the $G$-equivariant Poincar\'e duality for oriented $G$-manifolds,
for any connected compact Lie group $G$, following the work of J.-L. Brylinski leading to the spectral
sequence $$\mathop{\rm Extgr}\nolimits_{H_G}(H_{G,\rm c} (M),H_G)\Rightarrow H_{G}(M)[d_{M}]\,.$$
The equivariant Gysin functor $(\_)_!:=\Omega_{G}(\_)\in\mathcal D^{+}(\mathord{\rm DGM}(H_{G}))$
(resp. $(\_)_{*}:=\Omega_{G,\rm c}(\_)$) is then defined in the category of oriented $G$-manifolds
and proper maps (resp. unrestricted maps) with values in the derived category of the category of
differential graded modules over $H_{G}$, as the composition of the Cartan complex of equivariant
differential forms functor $\Omega_{G,\rm c}(\_)$ (resp. $\Omega_{G}(\_)$) with the duality
functor $I\mkern-4.5muR\,{\rm Hom}_{H_{G}}^{\bullet}(\_,H_{G})$ and the equivariant Poincar\'e
adjunction $I\mkern-4.5muD_{G} (M):\Omega_{G} (M)[d_{M}]\to I\mkern-4.5muR\,{\rm Hom}_{H_{G}}^{\bullet}(\Omega_{G,\rm
c} (M),H_{G} )$ (resp. $I\mkern-4.5muD_{G}' (M):\Omega_{G,\rm c} (M)[d_{M}]\to I\mkern-4.5muR\,{\rm
Hom}_{H_{G}}^{\bullet}(\Omega_{G} (M),H_{G} )$). Equivariant Euler classes are next introduced
for any closed embedding $i:N\subseteq M$ as ${\rm Eu}_{G}(N,M):=i^{*}i_{!}(1)$ where $i^{*}i_{!}:H_{G}(N)\to
H_{G}(N)$ is the push-pull operator. Some localization and fixed point theorems finish the notes.
The idea of introducing Gysin morphisms through an equivariant Poincar\'e duality formalism \`a
la Grothendieck-Verdier has many theoretical advantages and is somewhat uncommon in the equivariant
setting, warranting publication of these notes.
