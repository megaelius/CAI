Madeo, Luca Placidi, Giuseppe Rosi. The relaxed linear micromorphic continuum: existence, uniqueness
and continuous dependence in dynamics, submitted, 2013, arXiv:1308.3762 ] has been used to study
wave propagation in unbounded continua with microstructure. By studying dispersion relations
for the considered relaxed medium, we are able to disclose precise frequency ranges (band-gaps)
for which propagation of waves cannot occur. These dispersion relations are strongly nonlinear
so giving rise to a macroscopic dispersive behavior of the considered medium. We prove that the presence
of band-gaps is related to a unique elastic coefficient, the so-called Cosserat couple modulus
$\mu_{c}$, which is also responsible for the loss of symmetry of the Cauchy force stress tensor.
This parameter can be seen as the trigger of a bifurcation phenomenon since the fact of slightly changing
its value around a given threshold drastically changes the observed response of the material with
respect to wave propagation. We finally show that band-gaps cannot be accounted for by classical
micromorphic models as well as by Cosserat and second gradient ones. The potential fields of application
of the proposed relaxed model are manifold, above all for what concerns the conception of new engineering
materials to be used for vibration control and stealth technology.
