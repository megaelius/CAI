These notes aim at providing a complete and systematic account of some foundational aspects of algebraic
supergeometry, namely, the extension to the geometry of superschemes of many classical notions,
techniques and results that make up the general backbone of algebraic geometry, most of them originating
from Grothendieck's work. In particular, we extend to algebraic supergeometry such notions as
projective and proper morphisms, finiteness of the cohomology, vector and projective bundles,
cohomology base change, semicontinuity theorems, relative duality, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity,
flattening, Hilbert and Quot schemes, faithfully flat descent, quotient \'etale relations (notably,
Picard schemes), among others. Some results may be found elsewhere, and, in particular, there is
some overlap with a recent preprint by Moosavian and Zhou. However, many techniques and constructions
are presented here for the first time, notably, a first development of Grothendieck relative duality
for proper morphisms of superschemes, the construction of the Hilbert superscheme in a more general
situation than the one already known (which in particular allows one to treat the case of sub-superschemes
of supergrassmannians), and a rigorous construction of the Picard superscheme for a locally superprojective
morphism of noetherian superschemes with geometrically integral fibres. Moreover, some of the
proofs given here are new as well, even when restricted to ordinary schemes. In a final section we
construct a period map from an open substack of the moduli of proper and smooth supercurves to the
moduli stack of principally polarized abelian superchemes.
