The classical stochastic control problem under partial information can be formulated as a control
problem for Zakai equation, whose solution is the unnormalized conditional probability distribution
of the state of the system, which is not directly accessible. Zakai equation is a stochastic Fokker-Planck
equation. Therefore, the problem to be solved is similar to that met in Mean Field Control theory.
Since Mean Field Control theory is much posterior to the development of Stochastic Control with
partial information, the tools, techniques, and concepts obtained in the last decade, for Mean
Field Games and Mean field type Control theory, have not been used for the control of Zakai equation.
It is the objective of this work to connect the two theories. Not only, we get the power of new tools,
but also we get new insights for the problem of stochastic control with partial information. For
mean field theory, we get new interesting applications, but also new problems. Indeed, Mean Field
Control Theory leads to very complex equations, like the Master equation, which is a nonlinear infinite
dimensional P.D.E., for which general theorems are hardly available, although active research
in this direction is performed. Direct methods are useful to obtain regularity results. We will
develop in detail the linear quadratic regulator problem, but because we cannot just consider the
Gaussian case, well-known results, as the separation principle is not available. An interesting
and important result is available in the literature, due to A. Makowsky. It describes the solution
of Zakai equation for linear systems with general initial condition (non-gaussian). Curiously,
this result had not been exploited for the control aspect, in the literature. We show that the separation
principle can be extended for quadratic pay-off functionals, but the Kalman filter is much more
complex than in the gaussian case.
