In this article, we perform quantitative analyses of the metastable behavior of an interacting
particle system known as the inclusion process. For inclusion processes, it is widely believed
that the system nucleates the condensation of particles because of the attractive nature of the
interaction mechanism. The metastable behavior of the inclusion processes corresponds to the
movement of the condensate on a suitable time scale, and the computation of the corresponding time
scale and the characterization of the scaling limit of the condensate motion are the main problems
in the study of metastability of inclusion processes. Previously, these problems were solved for
reversible inclusion processes in [Bianchi, Dommers, and Giardin\`a, Electronic Journal of Probability,
22: 1-34, 2017], and the main contribution of the present study is to extend this analysis to a wide
class of non-reversible inclusion processes. Non-reversibility is a major obstacle to analyzing
such models, mainly because there is no closed-form expression of the invariant measure for the
general case, and our main achievement is to overcome this difficulty. In particular, our results
demonstrate that the time scale and limiting process of non-reversible inclusion processes are
quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of reversible ones, respectively. We emphasize
that, to the best of our knowledge, these results are the first rigorous quantitative results in
the study of metastability when the invariant measure is not explicitly known. In addition, we consider
the thermodynamic limit of metastable behavior of inclusion processes on large torus as in [Armend\'ariz,
Grosskinsky, and Loulakis, Probability Theory and Related Fields, 169: 105-175, 2017]. For this
model, we observe three different time scales according to the level of asymmetry of the model.
