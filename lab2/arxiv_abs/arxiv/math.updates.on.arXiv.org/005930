Insufficient flexibility in system operation caused by traditional "heat-set" operating modes
of combined heat and power (CHP) units in winter heating periods is a key issue that limits renewable
energy consumption. In order to reduce the curtailment of renewable energy resources through improving
the operational flexibility, a novel optimal scheduling model based on chance-constrained programming
(CCP), aiming at minimizing the lowest generation cost, is proposed for a small-scale integrated
energy system (IES) with CHP units, thermal power units, renewable generations and representative
auxiliary equipments. In this model, due to the uncertainties of renewable generations including
wind turbines and photovoltaic units, the probabilistic spinning reserves are supplied in the
form of chance-constrained; from the perspective of user experience, a heating load model is built
with consideration of heat comfort and inertia in buildings. To solve the model, a solution approach
based on sequence operation theory (SOT) is developed, where the original CCP-based scheduling
model is tackled into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation by converting
a chance constraint into its deterministic equivalence class, and thereby is solved via the CPLEX
solver. The simulation results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that the presented
method manages to improve operational flexibility of the IES with uncertain renewable generations
by comprehensively leveraging thermal inertia of buildings and different kinds of auxiliary equipments,
which provides a fundamental way for promoting renewable energy consumption.
