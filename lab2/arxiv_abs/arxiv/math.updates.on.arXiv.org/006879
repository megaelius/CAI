The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM) developed by Rhebergen et al. (2008)
offers a robust method for solving systems of nonconservative hyperbolic partial differential
equations but, as we show here, does not satisfactorily deal with topography in shallow water flows
at lowest order (so-called DG0, or equivalently finite volume). In particular, numerical solutions
of the space-DG0 discretised one-dimensional shallow water equations over varying topography
are not truly `well-balanced'. A numerical scheme is well-balanced if trivial steady states are
satisfied in the numerical solution; in the case of the shallow water equations, initialised rest
flow should remain at rest for all times. Whilst the free-surface height and momentum remain constant
and zero, respectively, suggesting that the scheme is indeed well-balanced, the fluid depth and
topography evolve in time. This is both undesirable and unphysical, leading to incorrect numerical
solutions for the fluid depth, and is thus a concern from a predictive modelling perspective. We
expose this unsatisfactory issue, both analytically and numerically, and indicate a solution
that combines the DGFEM formulation for nonconservative products with a fast and stable well-balanced
finite-volume method. This combined scheme bypasses the offending issue and successfully integrates
nonconservative hyperbolic shallow water-type models with varying topography at lowest order.
We briefly discuss implications for the definition of a well-balanced scheme, and highlight applications
when higher-order schemes may not be desired, which give further value to our finding beyond its
exposure alone.
