We deal with the electromagnetic waves propagation in the harmonic regime. We derive the Foldy-Lax
approximation of the scattered fields generated by a cluster of small conductive inhomogeneities
arbitrarily distributed in a bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$. This approximation is
valid under a sufficient but general condition on the number of such inhomogeneities $m$, their
maximum radii $\epsilon$ and the minimum distances between them $\delta$, the form $$(\ln m)^{\frac{1}{3}}\frac{\epsilon}{\delta}
\leq C,$$ where $C$ is a constant depending only on the Lipschitz characters of the scaled inhomogeneities.
In addition, we provide explicit error estimates of this approximation in terms of aforementioned
parameters, $m, \epsilon, \delta$ but also the used frequencies $k$ under the Rayleigh regime.
Both the far-fields and the near-fields (stated at a distance $\delta$ to the cluster) are estimated.
In particular, for a moderate number of small inhomogeneities $m$, the derived expansions are valid
in the mesoscale regime where $\delta \sim \epsilon$. At the mathematical analysis level and based
on integral equation methods, we prove a priori estimates of the densities in the $L^{2,Div}_t$
spaces instead of the usual $L^2$ spaces (which are not enough). A key point in such a proof is a derivation
of a particular Helmholtz type decomposition of the densities. Those estimates allow to obtain
the needed qualitative as well as quantitative estimates while refining the approximation. Finally,
to prove the invertibility of the Foldy-Lax linear algebraic system, we reduce the coercivity inequality
to the one related to the scalar Helmholtz model. As this linear algebraic system comes from the boundary
conditions, such a reduction is not straightforward.
