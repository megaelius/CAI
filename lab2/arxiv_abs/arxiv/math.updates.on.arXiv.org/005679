Geometric perturbation theory is universal. A typical example is provided by the 3D wave equation,
widely used in acoustics. We face vibrating eardrums as a binaural auditory input stemming from
an external sound source. In the setup of internally coupled ears (ICE), which are present in more
than half of the land-living vertebrates, the two tympana are coupled by an internal air-filled
cavity, whose geometry determines the acoustic properties of the ICE system. The eardrums themselves
are described by a 2-dimensional, damped, wave equation and are part of the spatial boundary conditions
of the three-dimensional Laplacian belonging to the wave equation in the internal cavity that couples
and internally drives the eardrums. In animals with ICE the resulting signal is the superposition
of external sound arriving at both eardrums and the internal pressure coupling them. This is also
the typical setup for geometric perturbation theory. In the context of ICE it boils down to acoustic
boundary-condition dynamics (ABCD) for the coupled dynamical system of eardrums and internal
cavity. In acoustics the deviations from equilibrium are extremely small (nm). Perturbation theory
is therefore natural and shown to be appropriate. In doing so, we use a time-dependent perturbation
theory \`a la Dirac in the context of Duhamel's principle. The relaxation dynamics of the tympanic-membrane
system, which neuronal information processing stems from, is explicitly obtained in first order.
Furthermore, both the initial and the quasi-stationary asymptotic state are derived and analyzed.
Finally, we set the general stage for geometric perturbation theory where (d-1)-dimensional manifolds
as subsets of the boundary of a d-dimensional domain are driven by their own dynamics with the domain
pressure $p$ and an external source term as input, at the same time constituting time-dependent
boundary conditions for $p$.
