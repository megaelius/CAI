For various typical cases and situations where the formulation results in an optimal control problem,
the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach and its variants continue to be highly attractive.
For the LQR problem, the optimal solution can generally be effectively obtained by solving the Algebraic
Riccati Equation (ARE). However, in certain scenarios, it can happen that some prescribed structural
constraints on the gain matrix would arise. Consequently then, the ARE is no longer applicable in
a straightforward way to obtain the optimal solution. This work presents a rather effective alternate
optimization approach, based on gradient projection, applicable to such scenarios. The utilized
gradient is obtained through the methodology of a data-driven formulation, and then projected
onto applicable constrained hyperplanes. Essentially, this projection gradient determines
a direction of progression and computation for the gain matrix update with a decreasing functional
cost; and then the gain matrix is further refined in an iterative framework. With this formulation,
this work thus presents and proposes a new and effective alternate data-driven optimization algorithm
for controller synthesis with structural constraints. This data-driven approach also essentially
has the key advantage that it avoids the necessity of precise modeling which is always required in
the classical model-based counterpart; and thus the approach here can additionally accommodate
various model uncertainties. Illustrative examples are also provided in the work to validate the
theoretical results, and the examples also clearly show the applicability of the methodology in
the appropriate controller synthesis problems.
