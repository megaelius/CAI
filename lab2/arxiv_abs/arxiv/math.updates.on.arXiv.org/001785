A theoretical platform is developed for active elastic-wave sensing of (stationary and advancing)
fractures along bi-material interfaces in layered composites. Damaged contact surfaces are characterized
by a heterogeneous distribution of (elastic) stiffness $\boldsymbol{K}$ which is a-priori unknown.
The proposed imaging functional takes advantage of sequential wavefield measurements for non-iterative
and concurrent reconstruction of multiple fractures in heterogeneous domains, with an exceptional
spatial resolution and with minimal sensitivity to measurement errors and uncertain elasticity
of damage zones. This is accomplished through adaptation of the $F_\sharp$-factorization method
(FM) applied to elastodynamic wavefields in a sensing sequence i.e. a measurement campaign performed
before and after the formation (or evolution) of interfacial fractures. The direct scattering
problem is formulated in the frequency domain where the damage support is illuminated by a set of
incident P- and S-waves, and thus-induced scattered waves are monitored at the far field. In this
setting, the germane mixed reciprocity principle is introduced, and $F_\sharp$-factorization
of the differential scattering operator is rigorously established for composite backgrounds.
These results lead to the development of an FM-based fracture indicator whose affiliated cost functional
is inherently convex, thus, its minimizer can be computed without iterations. This attribute coupled
with the reduced sampling space, proposed in this work, remarkably expedite the data inversion
process. The performance of proposed imaging functional is demonstrated by a set of numerical experiments.
