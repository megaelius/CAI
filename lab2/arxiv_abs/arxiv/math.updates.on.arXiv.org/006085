In [15], the algebraico-tree-theoretic simplicity hierarchical structure of J. H. Conway's ordered
field $\mathbf{No}$ of surreal numbers was brought to the fore and employed to provide necessary
and sufficient conditions for an ordered field (ordered $K$-vector space) to be isomorphic to an
initial subfield ($K$-subspace) of $\mathbf{No}$, i.e. a subfield ($K$-subspace) of $\mathbf{No}$
that is an initial subtree of $\mathbf{No}$. In this sequel to [15], piggybacking on the just-said
results, analogous results are established for ordered exponential fields. It is further shown
that a wide range of ordered exponential fields are isomorphic to initial exponential subfields
of $(\mathbf{No}, \exp)$. These include all models of $T(\mathbb{R}_W, e^x)$, where $\mathbb{R}_W$
is the reals expanded by a convergent Weierstrass system $W$. Of these, those we call trigonometric-exponential
fields are given particular attention. It is shown that the exponential functions on the initial
trigonometric-exponential subfields of $\mathbf{No}$, which includes $\mathbf{No}$ itself,
extend to canonical exponential functions on their surcomplex counterparts. This uses the precursory
result that trigonometric-exponential initial subfields of $\mathbf{No}$ and trigonometric
ordered initial subfields of $\mathbf{No}$, more generally, admit canonical sine and cosine functions.
This is shown to apply to the members of a distinguished family of initial exponential subfields
of $\mathbf{No}$, to the image of the canonical map of the ordered exponential field $\mathbb{T}$
of transseries into $\mathbf{No}$, which is shown to be initial, and to the ordered exponential
fields $\mathbb{R}((\omega))^{EL}$ and $\mathbb{R}\langle\langle\omega\rangle \rangle$,
which are likewise shown to be initial.
