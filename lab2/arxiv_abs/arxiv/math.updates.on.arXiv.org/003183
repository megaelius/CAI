In this paper, we propose a new, combined Zero-Forcing Per-Group Precoding (ZF-PGP) method that
achieves very high gains in comparison to ZF Precoding techniques, while it simultaneously offers
individually separate streams to reach individual User Equipment (UE), i.e., it obliterates the
need for coordinated, joint decoding by the group's UEs. Although ZF-PGP in general experiences
a performance loss in comparison to the near-optimal Per-Group Precoding within groups (PGP-WG),
it is much simpler to implement than PGP-WG. The method works extremely well in conjunction with
Combined Frequency and Space Division and Multiplexing (CFSDM) in correlated channels or in cases
in which the group's total number of antennas is greater than the group's available Virtual Channel
Model Beams (VCMB) number. As we show by multiple examples, for a Uniform Linear Array (ULA), by combining
the proposed technique with massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and Joint Spatial
Division and Multiplexing for Finite Alphabets (JSDM-FA) type hybrid precoding or CFSDM a very
efficient, near-optimal design with reduced complexity at the UEs is achieved, while each UE decodes
its received data independently, without interference from data destined for other UEs. Due to
JSDM-FA Statistical Channel State Information (SCSI) inner beamforming, the groups are easily
identified. We show that the combined ZF-PGP scheme achieves very high gains in comparison to ZF
and Regularized ZF (RZF) precoding and other modified sub-optimal techniques investigated, while
its complexity is still relatively low due to PGP-WG. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
precoding techniques to channel estimation errors, showing minimal performance loss.
