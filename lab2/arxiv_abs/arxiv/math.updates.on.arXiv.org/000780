The paper presents four distinct new ideas and results for communication networks: 1) We show that
relay-networks (i.e. communication networks where different nodes use the same coding functions)
can be used to model dynamic networks. 2) We introduce {\em the term model}, which is a simple, graph-free
symbolic approach to communication networks. 3) We state and prove variants of a theorem concerning
the dispersion of information in single-receiver communications. 4) We show that the solvability
of an abstract multi-user communication problem is equivalent to the solvability of a single-target
communication in a suitable relay network. In the paper, we develop a number of technical ramifications
of these ideas and results. One technical result is a max-flow min-cut theorem for the R\'enyi entropy
with order less than one, given that the sources are equiprobably distributed; conversely, we show
that the max-flow min-cut theorem fails for the R\'enyi entropy with order greater than one. We leave
the status of the theorem with regards to the ordinary Shannon Entropy measure (R\'enyi entropy
of order one and the limit case between validity or failure of the theorem) as an open question. In
non-dynamic static communication networks with a single receiver, a simple application of Menger's
theorem shows that the optimal throughput can be achieved without proper use of network coding i.e.
just by using ordinary packet-switching. This fails dramatically in relay networks with a single
receiver. We show that even a powerful method like linear network coding fails miserably for relay
networks. With that in mind, it is noticeable that our rather weak form of network coding (routing
with dynamic headers) is asymptotically sufficient to reach capacity.
