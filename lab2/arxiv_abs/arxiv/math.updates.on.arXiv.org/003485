The path measure corresponding to the {\it{Polaron problem}} appearing in quantum statistical
mechanics is defined as the tilted measure $\mathrm d \widehat{\mathbb P}_{\varepsilon,T}$ which
has a density proportional to the weight $$\exp\bigg\{\frac{1}{2}\int_{-T}^T\int_{-T}^T \frac{\varepsilon\mathrm
e^{-\varepsilon |t-s|}}{|\omega(t)-\omega(s)|} \,\mathrm d s \,\mathrm d t\bigg\}$$ with respect
to the distribution of the increments of the three dimensional Brownian motion restricted to the
time window $[-T,T]$. Here $\varepsilon>0$ is a parameter. In \cite{MV18} it was shown that when
$\varepsilon>0$ is either sufficiently small or sufficiently large (but fixed), the limit $\lim_{T\to\infty}\widehat{\mathbb
P}_{\varepsilon,T}=\widehat{\mathbb P}_{\varepsilon}$ exists as a process with stationary
increments and this limit was identified fairly explicitly. The physically interesting regime
is the {\it{strong coupling behavior}} which corresponds to studying the limit $\lim_{\varepsilon\to
0} \widehat{\mathbb P}_\varepsilon$. In the present article, this strong-coupling limit of the
Polaron measure is shown to exist and is uniquely identified with the {\it{increments}} of the so-called
{\it{Pekar process}}, a stationary diffusion with generator $\frac 12 \Delta+ (\nabla\psi/\psi)\cdot
\nabla$, where $\psi$ is any maximizer of the {\it{Pekar variational problem}} $$ g_0=\sup_{\|\psi\|_2=1}
\Big\{\int_{\mathbb R^3}\int_{\mathbb R^3}\,\psi^2(x) \psi^2(y)|x-y|^{-1}\mathrm d x\mathrm
d y -\frac 12\|\nabla \psi\|_2^2\Big\}. $$ As the Pekar process was also earlier shown (\cite{MV14,KM15,BKM15})
to be the limiting object of the {\it{mean-field Polaron measures}}, the present identification
of the strong coupling limit is a rigorous justification of the mean-field approximation of the
Polaron problem on the level of path properties, which was conjectured by Spohn in \cite{S87}.
