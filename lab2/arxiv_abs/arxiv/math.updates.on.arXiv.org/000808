This paper derives stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for fluid dynamics from
a stochastic variational principle (SVP). Both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are applied
in the derivation of the stochastic dynamics. The paper proceeds by: taking variations in the SVP
to derive stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations; writing their It\^o representation; taking
the expectation (or mean) of the It\^o equations; and then investigating the properties of these
stochastic fluid models in comparison with the corresponding deterministic fluid models. The
circulation properties of the stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations are found to closely mimic
those of the deterministic ideal fluid models. However, the It\^o case deviates considerably because
of the difference in the drift velocities. For example, the Kelvin theorem for preservation of circulation
in a deterministic ideal incompressible fluid flow continues to hold in the Stratonovich case,
provided the circulation loop follows the Stratonovich stochastic path. However, circulation
is not preserved when the loop follows the stochastic path in the It\^o case, because of the additional
quadratic term that appears in It\^o calculus. Motion along the stochastic Stratonovich paths
also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in incompressible stochastic flows, but not
so for stochastic It\^o paths. The paper also derives motion equations for two examples of stochastic
geophysical fluid dynamics (SGFD). The importance of Kelvin's circulation theorem in the example
of Stratonovich SGFD equations is emphasised by deriving a conservation law for the potential vorticity
of fluid particles moving along Stratonovich stochastic paths in both the Euler-Boussinesq and
quasigeostropic approximations. However, again, the corresponding potential vorticity conservation
results do not hold for It\^o flows.
