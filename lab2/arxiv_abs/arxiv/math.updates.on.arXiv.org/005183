The Douglas-Rachford method (DR) and its product space variant are often employed as iterated maps
for solving the feasibility problem of the form: Find $x \in \bigcap_{k=1}^N S_k.$ The sets $S_k$
typically represent constraints that are easy to satisfy individually, but more challenging when
imposed together. When the constraints under consideration are modeled by closed, convex, nonempty
sets, convergence is well-understood. The method also demonstrates surprising performance with
nonconvex sets. Recently, the method of circumcentering reflections has been introduced, with
the aim of accelerating convergence of averaged reflection methods like DR in the convex setting
of hypersurfaces. We introduce a generalization, GCR, that is amenable to employment when the circumcentering
reflections operator fails to be proper. We prove local convergence for certain plane curves together
with lines, the natural prototypical setting of most theoretical analysis of regular nonconvex
DR. In particular, for GCR, we demonstrate local convergence to feasible points in cases where DR
only converges to fixed points. For those cases where DR is proven to converge to a feasible point,
we show that GCR provides a better convergence rate. Finally, as a root finder, we show that GCR has
local convergence whenever Newton-Raphson does, exhibits quadratic convergence whenever Newton-Raphson
does so, and exhibits superlinear convergence in many cases where Newton-Raphson fails to converge
at all. Motivated by our theoretical results, we introduce a new 2 stage DR-GCR search algorithm,
and we apply it to wavelet construction recast as a feasibility problem, demonstrating its acceleration
over regular DR.
