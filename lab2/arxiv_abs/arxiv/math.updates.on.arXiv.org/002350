Motivated by problems on random differences in Szemer\'edi's theorem and on large deviations for
arithmetic progressions in random sets, we prove upper bounds on the Gaussian width of point sets
that are formed by the image of the $n$-dimensional Boolean hypercube under a mapping $\psi:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^k$,
where each coordinate is a constant-degree multilinear polynomial with 0-1 coefficients. We show
the following applications of our bounds. Let $[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]_p$ be the random subset
of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ containing each element independently with probability $p$. - A
set $D\subseteq \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ is $\ell$-intersective if any dense subset of $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$
contains a proper {$(\ell+1)$}-term arithmetic progression with common difference in $D$. Our
main result implies that $[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]_p$ is $\ell$-intersective with probability
$1 - o(1)$ provided $p \geq \omega(N^{-\beta_\ell}\log N)$ for $\beta_\ell = (\lceil(\ell+1)/2\rceil)^{-1}$.
This gives a polynomial improvement for all $\ell \ge 2$ of a previous bound due to Frantzikinakis,
Lesigne and Wierdl, and reproves more directly the same improvement shown recently by the authors
and Dvir. - Let $X_k$ be the number of $k$-term arithmetic progressions in $[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]_p$
and consider the large deviation rate $\rho_k(\delta) = \log\Pr[X_k \geq (1+\delta)\mathbb{E}X_k]$.
We give quadratic improvements of the best-known range of $p$ for which a highly precise estimate
of $\rho_k(\delta)$ due to Bhattacharya, Ganguly, Shao and Zhao is valid for all odd $k \geq 5$. We
also discuss connections with the above-mentioned error correcting codes (locally decodable
codes) and the Banach-space notion of type for injective tensor products of $\ell_p$-spaces.
