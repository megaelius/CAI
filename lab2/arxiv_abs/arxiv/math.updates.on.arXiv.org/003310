In this paper we show, in particular, that the smallest singular value $\sigma_n(A)$ of an $N\times
n$ random matrix $A$ with i.i.d. mean zero variance one entries enjoys the following small ball estimate,
for any $\epsilon>0$: $$P\left(\sigma_n(A)<\epsilon(\sqrt{N+1}-\sqrt{n})\right)\leq (C\epsilon)^{N-n+1}\left(\log{1}/{\epsilon}\right)^{N-n+2}+e^{-cN},$$
which matches (up to a logarithmic error), for \emph{heavy-tailed matrices with arbitrary aspect
ratio}, the corresponding sub-gaussian behavior (see Rudelson and Vershynin \cite{RudVer-general}).
Furthermore, we show that in the case of the heavy-tailed square $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with \emph{not
necessarily i.i.d.} entries, provided appropriate assumptions hold, the smallest singular value
behaves nicely: $$P\left(\sigma_n(A)<\frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\leq C\epsilon+e^{-cN}.$$
In particular, one may consider an i.i.d. heavy-tailed (even heavier than second moment bounded)
$n\times n$ random matrix and multiply a few columns by $\sqrt{n}$, and this does not affect the small
ball behavior of the smallest singular value. This extends the results of Rudelson and Vershynin
\cite{RudVer-square} and Rebrova and Tikhomirov \cite{RebTikh}. The proofs use the methods of
Rudelson and Vershynin \cite{RudVer-square}, \cite{RudVer-general}; an efficient way of discretizing
the unit sphere (previously explored in \cite{KLkold}) allows us to bring them forward to the heavy-tailed
case. We show the existence of nets near the sphere, which compare values of any (deterministic)
random matrix on the sphere and on the net via \emph{a refinement of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm}. Such
refinement is a form of averaging, and enjoys strong large deviation properties, when the matrix
is random with very mild assumptions. Our results about nets might be of separate interest.
