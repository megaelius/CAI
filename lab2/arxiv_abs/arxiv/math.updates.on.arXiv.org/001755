We extend the method of multiscale analysis for resonances introduced in [5] in order to infer analytic
properties of resonances and eigenvalues (and their eigenprojections) as well as estimates for
the localization of the spectrum of dilated Hamiltonians and norm-bounds for the corresponding
resolvent operators, in neighborhoods of resonances and eigenvalues. We apply our method to the
massless Spin-Boson model assuming a slight infrared regularization. We prove that the resonance
and the ground-state eigenvalue (and their eigenprojections) are analytic with respect to the
dilation parameter and the coupling constant. Moreover, we prove that the spectrum of the dilated
Spin-Boson Hamiltonian in the neighborhood of the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue is
localized in two cones in the complex plane with vertices at the location of the resonance and the
ground-state eigenvalue, respectively. Additionally, we provide norm-estimates for the resolvent
of the dilated Spin-Boson Hamiltonian near the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue. The
topic of analyticity of eigenvalues and resonances has let to several studies and advances in the
past. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it is addressed from the perspective
of multiscale analysis. Once the multiscale analysis is set up our method gives easy access to analyticity:
Essentially, it amounts to proving it for isolated eigenvalues only and use that uniform limits
of analytic functions are analytic. The type of spectral and resolvent estimates that we prove are
needed to control the time evolution including the scattering regime. The latter will be demonstrated
in a forthcoming publication. The introduced multiscale method to study spectral and resolvent
estimates follows its own inductive scheme and is independent (and different) from the method we
apply to construct resonances.
