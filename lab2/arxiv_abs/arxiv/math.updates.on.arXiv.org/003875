In this paper we revisit the deterministic version of the Sparse Fourier Transform problem. While
the randomized case is well-understood, the main work in the deterministic case is the work of Merhi
et al. (J Fourier Anal Appl 2018), which obtains O(k^2 log^{5.5} n) samples and similar runtime with
the \ell_2/\ell_1 guarantee. We focus on the stronger \ell_\infty/\ell_1 guarantee and the closely
related problem of incoherent matrices. We list our contributions as follows. 1. We give a "for-all"
scheme with O(k^2 log n) samples. 2. We give a for-all scheme with O(k^2 log^2 n) samples, and O(k^2
log^3 n) time. 3. We derandomize both schemes in polynomial time in n, such that all subsequent Sparse
Fourier Transform "queries" can be answered deterministically in O(nk log n) and O(k^2 log^3 n)
time, respectively. 4. We give two different deterministic constructions of incoherent matrices,
combinatorial objects that are closely related to \ell_infty/\ell_1 sparse recovery schemes.
The first one keeps rows of the Discrete Fourier Matrix, while the second uses Fourier-friendly
measurements with the help of the Weil bound from algebraic geometry. Our constructions match previous
constructions by DeVore (J Complexity 2007), Amini and Marvasti (IEEE Trans Info Theory 2011) and
Nelson, Nguyen and Woodruff (RANDOM 12), where there was no constraint on the form of the incoherent
matrix. Our algorithms are nearly sample optimal, since a lower bound of {\Omega}(k^2 + k log n) is
known, even for the case where the sensing matrix can be arbitrarily designed. Similarly, for incoherent
matrices, a lower bound of {\Omega}(k^2 log n/ log k) is known, indicating that our constructions
are nearly optimal.
