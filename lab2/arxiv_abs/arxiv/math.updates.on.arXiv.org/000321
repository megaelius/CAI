In this review article, we report two important competing data assimilation schemes that were developed
in the past 20 years, discuss the current methods that are operationally used in weather forecasting
applications, and point out one major challenge in data assimilation community: "utilize these
existing schemes in the presence of model error". The aim of this paper is to provide theoretical
guidelines to mitigate model error in practical applications of filtering multiscale dynamical
systems with reduced models. This is a prototypical situation in many applications due to limited
ability to resolve the smaller scale processes as well as the difficulty to model the interaction
across scales. We present simple examples to point out the importance of accounting for model error
when the separation of scales are not apparent. These examples also elucidate the necessity of treating
model error as a stochastic process in a nontrivial fashion for optimal filtering, in the sense that
the mean and covariance estimates are as accurate as those of the true filter. In general, however,
it is difficult to guess the appropriate stochastic models to represent model error. Several classical
approaches to estimate model error statistics are briefly reviewed and reassessed, and several
recent developments are overviewed, including important open problems/questions. We hope that
this review article can make this important issue accessible to inspire more scientists to work
on this exciting open problem. More importantly, we hope that it can help the future design of more
robust methods for coping with model errors.
