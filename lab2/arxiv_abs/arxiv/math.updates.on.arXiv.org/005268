This paper concerns the robust vector problems \begin{equation*} \mathrm{(RVP)}\ \ {\rm Wmin}\left\{
F(x): x\in C,\; G_u(x)\in -S,\;\forall u\in\mathcal{U}\right\}, \end{equation*} where $X,
Y, Z$ are locally convex Hausdorff topological vector spaces, $K$ is a closed and convex cone in $Y$
with nonempty interior, and $S$ is a closed, convex cone in $Z$, $\mathcal{U}$ is an \textit{uncertainty
set}, $F\colon X\rightarrow {Y}^\bullet,$ $G_u\colon X\rightarrow Z^\bullet$ are proper mappings
for all $ u \in \mathcal{U}$, and $\emptyset \ne C\subset X$. Let $ A:=C\cap \left(\bigcap_{u\in\mathcal{U}}G_u^{-1}(-S)\right)$
and $I_A : X \to Y^\bullet $ be the indicator map defined by $I_A(x) = 0_Y $ if $x \in A$ and $I_A(x) = +
\infty_Y$ if $ x \not\in A$. It is well-known that the epigraph of the conjugate mapping $(F+I_A)^\ast$,
in general, is not a convex set. We show that, however, it is "$k$-sectionally convex" in the sense
that each section form by the intersection of epi$(F+I_A)^\ast$ and any translation of a "specific
$k$-direction-subspace" is a convex subset, for any $k$ taking from int$\,K$. The key results of
the paper are the representations of the epigraph of the conjugate mapping $(F+I_A)^\ast$ via the
closure of the $k$-sectionally convex hull of a union of epigraphs of conjugate mappings of mappings
from a family involving the data of the problem (RVP). The results are then given rise to stable robust
vector/convex vector Farkas lemmas which, in turn, are used to establish new results on robust strong
stable duality results for (RVP). It is shown at the end of the paper that, when specifying the result
to some concrete classes of scalar robust problems (i.e., when $Y = \mathbb{R}$), our results cover
and extend several corresponding known ones in the literature.
