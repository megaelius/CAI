In this paper and its sequel, we study non-equilibrium dynamics in driven 1+1D conformal field theories
(CFTs) with periodic, quasi-periodic, and random driving. We study a soluble family of drives in
which the Hamiltonian only involves the energy-momentum density spatially modulated at a single
wavelength. The resulting time evolution is then captured by a M\"obius coordinate transformation.
In this Part I, we establish the general framework and focus on the first two classes. In periodically
driven CFTs, we generalize earlier work and study the generic features of entanglement/energy
evolution in different phases, i.e. the heating, non-heating phases and the phase transition between
them. In quasi-periodically driven CFTs, we mainly focus on the case of driving with a Fibonacci
sequence. We find that (i) the non-heating phases form a Cantor set of measure zero; (ii) in the heating
phase, the Lyapunov exponents (which characterize the growth rate of the entanglement entropy
and energy) exhibit self-similarity, and can be arbitrarily small; (iii) the heating phase exhibits
periodicity in the location of spatial structures at the Fibonacci times; (iv) one can find exactly
the non-heating fixed point, where the entanglement entropy/energy oscillate at the Fibonacci
numbers, but grow logarithmically/polynomially at the non-Fibonacci numbers; (v) for certain
choices of driving Hamiltonians, the non-heating phases of the Fibonacci driving CFT can be mapped
to the energy spectrum of electrons propagating in a Fibonacci quasi-crystal. In addition, another
quasi-periodically driven CFT with an Aubry-Andr\'e like sequence is also studied. We compare
the CFT results to lattice calculations and find remarkable agreement.
