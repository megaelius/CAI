Inspired by the recent successful completion of the study of the well-posedness theory for the Cauchy
problem of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation \[ u_t +uu_x +u_{xxx}=0, \quad \left. u \right |_{t=0}=u_{0}
\] in the space $H^{s} (\mathbb{R})$ (or $H^{s} (\mathbb{T})$), we study the well-posedness of
the Cauchy problem for a class of coupled KdV-KdV (cKdV) systems \[\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
u_t+a_{1}u_{xxx} &=& c_{11}uu_x+c_{12}vv_x+d_{11}u_{x}v+d_{12}uv_{x},\\ v_t+a_{2}v_{xxx}&=&
c_{21}uu_x+c_{22}vv_x +d_{21}u_{x}v+d_{22}uv_{x},\\ \left. (u,v)\right |_{t=0} &=& (u_{0},v_{0})
\end{array}\right.\] in the space $\mathcal{H}^s (\mathbb{R}) := H^s (\mathbb{R})\times H^s
(\mathbb{R})$. Typical examples include the Gear-Grimshaw system, the Hirota-Satsuma system
and the Majda-Biello system, to name a few. In this paper we look for those values of $s\in \mathbb{R}$
for which the cKdV systems are well-posed in $\mathcal{H}^s (\m{R})$. Our findings enable us to
provide a complete classification for the cKdV systems in terms of the analytical well-posedness
in $\mathcal{H}^s (\mathbb{R})$ based on its coefficients $a_i$, $c_{ij}$ and $d_{ij}$ for $i,j=1,2$.
The key ingredients in the proofs are the bilinear estimates under the Fourier restriction space
norms. There are four types of the bilinear estimates that need to be investigated. Sharp results
are established for all of them. In contrast to the lone critical index $-\frac{3}{4}$ for the single
KdV equation, the critical indexes for the cKdV systems are $-\frac{13}{12}$, $-\frac{3}{4}$,
$0$ and $\frac{3}{4}$. As a result, the cKdV systems are classified into four classes, each of which
corresponds to a unique index $s^{*}\in\{-\frac{13}{12},\,-\frac{3}{4},\,0,\,\frac{3}{4}\}$
such that any system in this class is locally analytically well-posed if $s>s^{*}$ while the bilinear
estimate fails if $s<s^{*}$.
