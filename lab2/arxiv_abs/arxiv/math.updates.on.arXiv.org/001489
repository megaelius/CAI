One of the most significant 5G technology enablers will be Device-to-Device (D2D) communications.
D2D communications constitute a promising way to improve spectral, energy and latency performance,
exploiting the physical proximity of communicating devices and increasing resource utilization.
Furthermore, network infrastructure densification has been considered as one of the most substantial
methods to increase system performance, taking advantage of base station proximity and spatial
reuse of system resources. However, could we improve system performance by leveraging both of these
two 5G enabling technologies together in a multi-cell environment? How does spectrum sharing affect
performance enhancement? This article investigates the implications of interference, densification
and spectrum sharing in D2D performance gain. The in-band D2D approach, where legacy users coexist
with potential D2D pairs, is considered in a multi-cell system. Overlay and underlay spectrum sharing
approaches are employed in order for the potential D2D pairs to access the spectrum. Given that two
of the most critical problems in the D2D concept are mode selection and user scheduling, we jointly
address them, aiming at maximizing the total system uplink throughput. Thus, we present a radio
resource management mechanism for intra-cell and cross-cell overlay/underlay D2D communications
enabled in a multi-cell system. System-level simulations are executed to evaluate the system performance
and examine the trends of D2D communication gain for the different spectrum sharing approaches
and various densification scenarios. Finally, realworld SDR-based experiments are performed
to test and assess D2D communications for overlay and underlay spectrum sharing.
