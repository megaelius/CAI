The dissertation deals with noncommutative field theories, namely field theories compatible
with the existence of a minimal (quantum gravity) length scale. Two families of quantum spacetime
are considered. One is characterized by semisimple Lie algebras of coordinates. The other is characterized
by solvable Lie algebras. The explicit construction of corresponding Weyl-like star products
is given. We then focus on two specific examples of quantum space and study the quantum properties
of various models of scalar field theory with quartic interactions built on them. The corresponding
2-point and 4-point functions are computed at one-loop and the UV/IR mixing is discussed. The first
quantum spacetime considered is known as $\mathbb{R}^3_\theta$ which is a deformation of $\mathbb{R}^3$
with $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ noncommutativity. In this case, the one-loop 2-point function is found
to be finite with the deformation parameter playing the role of a cutoff. The second quantum space
is known as $\kappa$-Minkowski. In this case, the action functional is required $\kappa$-Poincar\'e
invariant and various kinetic operators are considered. In one case, we find that the one-loop 2-point
function has milder UV divergence than in the commutative case and that the one-loop 4-point function
is finite. The renormalization properties are discussed. Besides, the loss of cyclicity of the
Lebesgue integral (which results from the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e invariance of the action functional)
is interpreted as reflecting the occurrence of KMS condition at the level of the algebra of fields
modelling $\kappa$-Minkowski. This interpretation sheds new light on $\kappa$-deformation-based
quantum gravity models, and solved a 25 years old problem in the study of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e invariant
quantum field theories. Possible extensions of this work are finally discussed.
