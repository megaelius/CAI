We consider systems that start from and/or end in thermodynamic equilibrium while experiencing
a finite rate of change of their energy density or of other intensive quantities $q$ at intermediate
times. We demonstrate that at these times, during which the global intensive quantities $q$ vary
at a finite rate, the size of the associated covariance, the connected pair correlator $|G_{ij}|
= |\langle q_{i} q_{j} \rangle - \langle q_{i} \rangle \langle q_{j} \rangle|$, between any two
({\it arbitrarily far separated}) sites $i$ and $j$ may, on average, become finite. Such non-vanishing
connected correlations between asymptotically distant sites are general and may also appear in
theories that only have local interactions. In simple models, these correlations may be traced
to the generic macroscopic entanglement of finite temperature states. Once the global mean $q$
no longer changes, the average of $|G_{ij}|$ over all spatial separations $|i-j|$ may tend to zero.
However, when the equilibration times are significant (e.g., as in a glass that is not in true thermodynamic
equilibrium yet in which the energy density (or temperature) reaches a final steady state value),
these long range correlations may persist also long after $q$ ceases to change. We explore viable
experimental implications of our findings and speculate on their potential realization in glasses
(where a prediction of a theory based on the effect that we describe here suggests a universal collapse
of the viscosity that agrees with all published viscosity measurements over sixteen decades) and
non-Fermi liquids. We derive new uncertainty relation based inequalities that connect the heat
capacity to the dynamics in general open thermal systems. We further briefly comment on parallels
between quantum measurements and unitary quantum evolution and thermalization.
