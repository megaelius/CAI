We consider closed meandric systems, and their equivalent description in terms of the Hasse diagrams
of the lattices of non-crossing partitions $NC(n)$. In this equivalent description, the number
of components of a random meandric system of order $n$ translates into the distance between two partitions
in $NC(n)$. We focus on a class of couples $(\pi,\rho)\in NC(n)^2$ -- namely the ones where $\pi$
is conditioned to be an interval partition -- for which it turns out to be tractable to study distances
in the Hasse diagram. As a consequence, we observe a non-trivial class of meanders (i.e. connected
meandric systems), which we call "meanders with shallow top", and which can be explicitly enumerated.
Moreover, the expected number of components for a random "meandric system with shallow top", is
asymptotically $(9n+28)/27$. Our calculations concerning expected number of components are
related to the idea of taking the derivative at $t=1$ in a semigroup for the operation $\boxplus$
of free probability (but the underlying considerations are presented in a self-contained way,
and can be followed without assuming a free probability background). Let $c_{n}'$ denote the expected
number of components of a general, unconditioned, meandric system of order $n$. A variation of the
methods used in the shallow-top case allows us to prove that $\mathrm{lim\ inf}_{n\to\infty}c_{n}'/n\geq0.17$.
We also note that, by a direct elementary argument, one has $\mathrm{lim\ sup}_{n\to\infty}c_{n}'/n\leq0.5$.
These bounds support the conjecture that $c_{n}'$ follows a regime of "constant times $n$" (where
numerical experiments suggest that the constant should be $\approx0.23$).
