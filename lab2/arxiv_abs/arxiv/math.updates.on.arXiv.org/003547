The beta transformation is the iterated map $\beta x\mod1$. The special case of $\beta=2$ is known
as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable. The Bernoulli map provides a model for pure, unrestrained
chaotic (ergodic) behavior: it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space $\{0,1\}^{\omega}$.
The beta transformation defines a subshift: iterated on the unit interval, it singles out a subspace
of the Cantor space, in such a way that it is invariant under the action of the left-shift operator.
That is, lopping off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace. The beta transform seems to capture
something basic about the multiplication of two real numbers: $\beta$ and $x$. It offers a window
into understanding the nature of multiplication. Iterating on multiplication, one would get $\beta^{n}x$
- that is, exponentiation; although the mod 1 of the beta transform contorts this in interesting
ways. The work presented here is a research diary: a pastiche of observations and some shallow insights.
One is that chaos seems to be rooted in how the carry bit behaves during multiplication. Another is
that one can surgically insert "islands of stability" into chaotic (ergodic) systems, and have
some fair amount of control over how those islands of stability behave. In particular, one can have
islands with, or without a period-doubling "route to chaos". The eigenvalues of the transfer operator
seem to lie on a circle of radius $1/\beta$ in the complex plane. Given that the transfer operator
is purely real, the appearance of such a quasi-unitary spectrum seems surprising. The spectrum
appears to be the limit of a dense set of quasi-cyclotomic polynomials, the positive real roots of
which include the Golden and silver ratios, the Pisot numbers, the n-bonnaci (tribonacci, tetranacci,
etc.) numbers.
