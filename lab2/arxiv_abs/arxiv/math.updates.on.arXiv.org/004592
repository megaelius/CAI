Randomization is a basis for the statistical inference of treatment effects without strong assumptions
on the outcome-generating process. Appropriately using covariates further yields more precise
estimators in randomized experiments. R. A. Fisher suggested blocking on discrete covariates
in the design stage or conducting the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in the analysis stage. We can
embed blocking into a wider class of experimental design called rerandomization, and extend the
classical ANCOVA to more general regression adjustment. Rerandomization trumps complete randomization
in the design stage, and regression adjustment trumps the simple difference-in-means estimator
in the analysis stage. It is then intuitive to use both rerandomization and regression adjustment.
Under the randomization-inference framework, we establish a unified theory allowing the designer
and analyzer to have access to different sets of covariates. We find that asymptotically (a) for
any given estimator with or without regression adjustment, rerandomization never hurts either
the sampling precision or the estimated precision, and (b) for any given design with or without rerandomization,
our regression-adjusted estimator never hurts the estimated precision. Therefore, combining
rerandomization and regression adjustment yields better coverage properties and thus improves
statistical inference. To theoretically quantify these statements, we first propose two notions
of optimal regression-adjusted estimators, and then measure the additional gains of the designer
and the analyzer in the sampling precision and the estimated precision. We finally suggest using
rerandomization in the design and regression adjustment in the analysis followed by the Huber--White
robust standard error.
