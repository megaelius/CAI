Let $\pi_1:\mathcal{X} \to \Delta$ be a flat family of smooth, projective curves of genus $g \ge
2$, degenerating to an irreducible nodal curve $X_0$ with exactly one node. Fix an invertible sheaf
$\mathcal{L}$ on $\mathcal{X}$ of relative odd degree. Let $\pi_2:\mathcal{G}(2,\mathcal{L})
\to \Delta$ be the relative Gieseker moduli space of rank $2$ semi-stable vector bundles with determinant
$\mathcal{L}$ over $\mathcal{X}$. Since $\pi_2$ is smooth over $\Delta^*$, there exists a canonical
family $\widetilde{\rho}_i:\mathbf{J}^i_{\mathcal{G}(2, \mathcal{L})_{\Delta^*}} \to
\Delta^{*}$ of $i$-th intermediate Jacobians i.e., for all $t \in \Delta^*$, $(\widetilde{\rho}_i)^{-1}(t)$
is the $i$-th intermediate Jacobian of $\pi_2^{-1}(t)$. There exist different N\'{e}ron models
$\overline{\rho}_i:\overline{\mathbf{J}}_{\mathcal{G}(2, \mathcal{L})}^i \to \Delta$
extending $\widetilde{\rho}_i$ to the entire disc $\Delta$, constructed by Clemens, Saito, Schnell,
Zucker and Green-Griffiths-Kerr. In this article, we prove that in our setup, the N\'{e}ron model
$\overline{\rho}_i$ is canonical in the sense that the different N\'{e}ron models coincide and
is an analytic fiber space which graphs admissible normal functions. We also show that for $1 \le
i \le \max\{2,g-1\}$, the central fiber of $\overline{\rho}_i$ is a fibration over product of copies
of $J^k(\mathrm{Jac}(\widetilde{X}_0))$ for certain values of $k$, where $\widetilde{X}_0$
is the normalization of $X_0$. In particular, for $g \ge 5$ and $i=2, 3, 4$, the central fiber of $\overline{\rho}_i$
is a semi-abelian variety. Furthermore, we prove that the $i$-th generalized intermediate Jacobian
of the (singular) central fibre of $\pi_2$ is a fibration over the central fibre of the N\'{e}ron
model $\overline{\mathbf{J}}^i_{\mathcal{G}(2, \mathcal{L})}$. In fact, for $i=2$ the fibration
is an isomorphism.
