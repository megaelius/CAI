Bayesian analysis is widely used in science and engineering for real-time forecasting, decision
making, and to help unravel the processes that explain the observed data. These data are some deterministic
and/or stochastic transformations of the underlying parameters. A key task is then to summarize
the posterior distribution of these parameters. When models become too difficult to analyze analytically,
Monte Carlo methods can be used to approximate the target distribution. Of these, Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly powerful. Such methods generate a random walk through the
parameter space and, under strict conditions of reversibility and ergodicity, will successively
visit solutions with frequency proportional to the underlying target density. This requires a
proposal distribution that generates candidate solutions starting from an arbitrary initial
state. The speed of the sampled chains converging to the target distribution deteriorates rapidly,
however, with increasing parameter dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a new proposal
distribution that enhances significantly the efficiency of MCMC simulation for highly parameterized
models. This proposal distribution exploits the cross-covariance of model parameters, measurements
and model outputs, and generates candidate states much alike the analysis step in the Kalman filter.
We embed the Kalman-inspired proposal distribution in the DREAM algorithm during burn-in, and
present several numerical experiments with complex, high-dimensional or multi-modal target
distributions. Results demonstrate that this new proposal distribution can greatly improve simulation
efficiency of MCMC. Specifically, we observe a speed-up on the order of 10-30 times for groundwater
models with more than one-hundred parameters.
