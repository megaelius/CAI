In a recent paper, {\it Algorithms for Deforming and Contracting Simply Connected Discrete Closed
Manifolds (II)}, we discussed two algorithms for deforming and contracting a simply connected
discrete closed manifold into a discrete sphere. The first algorithm was a continuation of work
that began in {\it Algorithms for Deforming and Contracting Simply Connected Discrete Closed Manifolds
(I)}, the second algorithm contained a more direct treatment of contraction for discrete manifolds.
In this paper, we clarify that we can use this same method on standard piecewise linear (PL) complexes
on the triangulation of general smooth manifolds. Our discussion is based on triangulation techniques
invented by Cairns, Whitehead, and Whitney more than half of a century ago. In this paper, we use PL
or simplicial complexes to replace certain concepts of discrete manifolds in previous papers.
Note that some details in the original papers related to discrete manifolds may also need to be slightly
modified for this purpose. In this paper, we use the algorithmic procedure (a contraction process)
to prove the following theorem: For a finite triangulation of a simply-connected closed and orientable
3-manifold $M$ in Euclidean space, if a (simply-connected closed) 2-cycle which was made by 2-cells
of this triangulation separates $M$ into two connected components, then each of the components
will also be simply-connected. In addition, we can algorithmically make $M$ to be homeomorphic
to a 3-sphere. The relationship of the theorem to a generalized Jordan separation problem, the general
Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, and other important problems are also discussed. This revision adds
more figures and explanations as well as two more special cases. We will post the detailed algorithm/procedure
for practical triangulations in the following papers.
