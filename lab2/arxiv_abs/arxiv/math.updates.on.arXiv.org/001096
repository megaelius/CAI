Goulden and Jackson (1996) introduced, using Jack symmetric functions, some multivariate generating
series $\psi(x, y, z; 1, 1+\beta)$ with an additional parameter $\beta$ that may be interpreted
as a continuous deformation of the rooted bipartite maps generating series. Indeed, it has the property
that for $\beta \in \{0,1\}$, it specializes to the rooted, orientable (general, i.e. orientable
or not, respectively) bipartite maps generating series. They made the following conjecture: coefficients
of $\psi$ are polynomials in $\beta$ with positive integer coefficients that can be written as a
multivariate generating series of rooted, general bipartite maps, where the exponent of $\beta$
is an integer-valued statistic that in some sense "measures the non-orientability" of the corresponding
bipartite map. We show that except for two special values of $\beta = 0,1$ for which the combinatorial
interpretation of the coefficients of $\psi$ is known, there exists a third special value $\beta
= -1$ for which the coefficients of $\psi$ indexed by two partitions $\mu,\nu$, and one partition
with only one part are given by rooted, orientable bipartite maps with arbitrary face degrees and
black/white vertex degrees given by $\mu$/$\nu$, respectively. We show that this evaluation corresponds,
up to a sign, to a top-degree part of the coefficients of $\psi$. As a consequence, we introduce a collection
of integer-valued statistics of maps $(\eta)$ such that the top-degree of the multivariate generating
series of rooted bipartite maps with only one face (called unicellular) with respect to $\eta$ gives
the top-degree of the appropriate coefficients of $\psi$. Finally, we show that the $b$-conjecture
holds true for all rooted, unicellular bipartite maps of genus at most $2$.
