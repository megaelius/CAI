The dominant theme of this thesis is the construction of matrix representations of finite solvable
groups using a suitable system of generators. For a finite solvable group $G$ of order $N = p_{1}p_{2}\dots
p_{n}$, where $p_{i}$'s are primes, there always exists a subnormal series: $\langle {e} \rangle
= G_{o} < G_{1} < \dots < G_{n} = G$ such that $G_{i}/G_{i-1}$ is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order
$p_{i}$, $i = 1,2,\dots,n$. Associated with this series, there exists a system of generators consisting
$n$ elements $x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}$ (say), such that $G_{i} = \langle x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots,
x_{i} \rangle$, $i = 1,2,\dots,n$, which is called a "long system of generators". In terms of this
system of generators and conjugacy class sum of $x_{i}$ in $G_{i}$, $i = 1,2, \dots, n$, we present
an algorithm for constructing the irreducible matrix representations of $G$ over $\mathbb{C}$
within the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[G]$. This algorithmic construction needs the knowledge
of primitive central idempotents, a well defined set of primitive (not necessarily central) idempotents
and the "diagonal subalgebra" of $\mathbb{C}[G]$. In terms of this system of generators, we give
simple expressions for the primitive central idempotents, a well defined system of primitive (not
necessarily central) idempotents and a convenient set of generators of the "diagonal subalgebra"
of $\mathbb{C}[G]$. For a finite abelian group, we present an algorithm for constructing the inequivalent
irreducible matrix representations over a field of characteristic $0$ or prime to the order of the
group and a systematic way of computing the primitive central idempotents of the group algebra.
Besides that, we give simple expressions of the primitive central idempotents of the rational group
algebra of a finite abelian group using a "long presentation" and it's Wedderburn decomposition.
