This paper investigates the existence of localised axisymmetric (radial) patterns on the surface
of a ferrofluid in the presence of a uniform vertical magnetic field. We formally investigate all
possible small-amplitude solutions which remain bounded close to the pattern's centre (the core
region) and decay exponentially away from the pattern's centre (the far-field region). The results
are presented for a finite-depth, infinite-radius cylinder of ferrofluid equipped with a linear
magnetisation law. These patterns bifurcate at the Rosensweig instability, where the applied
magnetic field strength reaches a critical threshold. Techniques for finding localised solutions
to a non-autonomous PDE system are established; solutions are decomposed onto a basis which is independent
of the radius, reducing the problem to an infinite set of nonlinear, non-autonomous ODEs. Using
radial centre manifold theory, local manifolds of small-amplitude solutions are constructed
in the core and far-field regions, respectively. Finally, using geometric blow-up coordinates,
we match the core and far-field manifolds; any solution that lies on this intersection is a localised
radial pattern. Four distinct classes of stationary radial solutions are found: elevated and depressed
spots, which have a larger magnitude at the core, and elevated and depressed rings, which have algebraic
decay towards the core. These solutions correspond exactly to the classes of localised radial solutions
found for the Swift-Hohenberg equation. Different values of the linear magnetisation and depth
of the ferrofluid are investigated and parameter regions in which the various localised radial
solutions emerge are identified. The approach taken in this paper outlines a route to rigorously
establishing the existence of axisymmetric localised patterns in the future.
