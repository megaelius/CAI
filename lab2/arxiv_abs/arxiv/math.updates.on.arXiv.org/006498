We prove a large deviation principle (LDP) and a fluctuation theorem (FT) for the entropy production
rate (EPR) of the following $d$ dimensional stochastic differential equation \begin{equation*}
d X_{t}=AX_{t} d t+\sqrt{Q} d B_{t} \end{equation*} where $A$ is a real normal stable matrix, $Q$
is positive definite, and the matrices $A$ and $Q$ commute. The rate function for the EPR takes the
following explicit form: \begin{equation*} I(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} x\frac{\sqrt{1+\ell_0(x)}-1}{2}+\frac
12\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d} \left(\sqrt{\alpha_k^2- \beta_k^2\ell_0(x)}+\alpha_k\right)
, & x\ge 0 , \\ -x\frac{\sqrt{1+\ell_0(x)}+1}{2} +\frac 12\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d} \left(\sqrt{\alpha_k^2-
\beta_k^2\ell_0(x)}+\alpha_k\right) , &x<0, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\alpha_{k}\pm
{\rm i} \beta_{k}$ are the eigenvalues of $A$, and $\ell_0(x)$ is the unique solution of the equation:
\begin{align*} |x|={\sqrt{1+\ell}} \times \sum_{k=1}^{d} \frac{\beta_k^2}{\sqrt{\alpha_k^2
-\ell\beta_k^2} },\qquad -1 \le \ell< \min_{k=1,...,d}\{\frac{\alpha_k^2}{\beta_k^2}\}.
\end{align*} Simple closed form formulas for rate functions are rare and our work identifies an
important class of large deviation problems where such formulas are available. The logarithmic
moment generating function (the fluctuation function) $\Lambda$ associated with the LDP has a
closed form (see it in the paper). The functions $\Lambda(\lambda)$ and $ I(x)$ satisfy the Cohen-Gallavotti
symmetry properties. In particular, the functions $I$ and $\Lambda$ do not depend on the diffusion
matrix $Q$, and are determined completely by the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of $A$.
Formally, the deterministic system with $Q=0$ has zero EPR and thus the model exhibits a phase transition
in that the EPR changes discontinuously at $Q = 0$.
