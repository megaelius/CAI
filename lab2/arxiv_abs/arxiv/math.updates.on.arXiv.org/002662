The $(m,n)$-online Ramsey game is a combinatorial game between two players, Builder and Painter.
Starting from an infinite set of isolated vertices, Builder draws an edge at each step and Painter
immediately paints the edge red or blue. Builder's goal is to force Painter to create either a red
$K_m$ or a blue $K_n$ using as few edges as possible. The online Ramsey number $\tilde{r}(m,n)$ is
the minimum number of edges Builder needs to guarantee a win in the $(m,n)$-online Ramsey game. By
analyzing the special case where Painter plays randomly, we obtain an exponential improvement
\[ \tilde{r}(n,n) \ge 2^{(2-\sqrt{2})n + O(1)} \] for the lower bound on the diagonal online Ramsey
number, as well as a corresponding improvement \[ \tilde{r}(m,n) \ge n^{(2-\sqrt{2})m + O(1)}
\] for the off-diagonal case, where $m\ge 3$ is fixed and $n\rightarrow\infty$. Using a different
randomized Painter strategy and the Lopsided Lov\'asz Local Lemma, we prove that $\tilde{r}(3,n)=\tilde{\Theta}(n^3)$,
determining this function up to a polylogarithmic factor. We also improve the upper bound in the
off-diagonal case for $m \geq 4$. In connection with the online Ramsey game with random Painter,
we study the problem of finding a copy of a target graph $H$ in a sufficiently large unknown Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi
random graph $G(N,p)$ using as few queries as possible, where each query reveals whether or not a
particular pair of vertices are adjacent. We call this problem the Subgraph Query Problem. We determine
the order of the number of queries needed for complete graphs up to five vertices and prove general
bounds for this problem.
