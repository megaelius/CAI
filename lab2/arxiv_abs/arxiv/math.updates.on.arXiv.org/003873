A Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) is a simple graph extracted from an ordered sequence of real
values, and this mapping has been used to provide a combinatorial encryption of time series for the
task of performing network based time series analysis. While some properties of the spectrum of
these graphs --such as the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix-- have been routinely used
as measures to characterise time series complexity, a theoretic understanding of such properties
is lacking. In this work we explore some algebraic and spectral properties of these graphs associated
to periodic and chaotic time series. We focus on the family of Feigenbaum graphs, which are HVGs constructed
in correspondence with the trajectories of one-parameter unimodal maps undergoing a period-doubling
route to chaos (Feigenbaum scenario). For the set of values of the map's parameter $\mu$ for which
the orbits are periodic with period $2^n$, Feigenbaum graphs are fully characterised by two integers
(n,k) and admit an algebraic structure. We explore the spectral properties of these graphs for finite
n and k, and among other interesting patterns we find a scaling relation for the maximal eigenvalue
and we prove some bounds explaining it. We also provide numerical and rigorous results on a few other
properties including the determinant or the number of spanning trees. In a second step, we explore
the set of Feigenbaum graphs obtained for the range of values of the map's parameter $\mu$ for which
the system displays chaos. We show that in this case, Feigenbaum graphs form an ensemble for each
value of $\mu$ and the system is typically weakly self-averaging. Unexpectedly, we find that while
the largest eigenvalue can distinguish chaos from an iid process, it is not a good measure to quantify
the chaoticity of the process, and that the eigenvalue density does a better job.
