We extend and complement previously existence results in the literature to the following $m-$polyharmonic
Kirchhoff problem: \begin{eqnarray} \label{10} \begin{cases} M(\|u\|_{r,m}^m)\Delta^r_m
u = f(x,u) &\mbox{in}\quad \Omega, \\ u=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \nu}\right)^k u=0,
\quad &\mbox{on}\quad \partial\Omega, \quad k=1, 2,....., r-1, \end{cases} \end{eqnarray}
where $\Omega\subset \R^N$ is a bounded smooth domain, $r \in \N^*$, $m >1$, $N\geq rm+1$, $M$ is
a Kirchhoff function and $\|\cdot\|_{r,m}$ is the norm of $W_0^{r,m}(\O)$. Our aim is to prove the
existence of infinitely many solutions of \eqref{10} for some odd functions $f$ in $u$, without
requiring any control on $f$ near $0$. The new aspect here consists in employing the Schauder basis
of $W_0^{r,m}(\O)$. We will also weaken the analogue of Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition, the
standard subcritical polynomial growth and the strong $m\gamma$-superlinear conditions required
in \cite{CP}. Similarly, we establish the existence of infinitely many solutions for the problem
\begin{eqnarray*} M(\|u\|_{r,m}^m)(\Delta^r_m u+a|u|^{m-2}u)=K(x) f(u) &\text{in\;$\mathbb{R}^{N}$,}
\end{eqnarray*} where $a$ is a {\bf nonnegative} real number (which covers the $m\gamma$-zero
mass case if $a=0$), $K$ is a continuous positive weight function such that $K\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\cap
L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$ with $\mathbf{p \geq 1}$ {\bf or} $K \to 0$ as $|x| \to \infty$.\\\\ In analogy
with the first eigenvalue of the $m$-polyharmonic operator, we introduce a positive quantity $\lambda_M$
to find a mountain pass solution, we discuss also the $m\gamma$-sublinear-polyharmonic problem
under a large growth conditions at infinity and at zero in a bounded domain.
