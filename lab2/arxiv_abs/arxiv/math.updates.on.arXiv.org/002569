We discuss fattening phenomenon for the evolution of planar curves according to their nonlocal
curvature. More precisely, we consider a class of generalized curvatures which correspond to the
first variation of suitable nonlocal perimeter functionals, defined in terms of an interaction
kernel $K$, which is symmetric, nonnegative, possibly singular at the origin, and satisfies appropriate
integrability conditions. We prove a general result about uniqueness of the geometric evolutions
starting from regular sets with positive $K$-curvature and we discuss the fattening phenomenon
for the evolution starting from the cross, showing that this phenomenon is very sensitive to the
strength of the interactions. As a matter of fact, we show that the fattening of the cross occurs for
kernels with sufficiently large mass near the origin, while for kernels that are sufficiently weak
near the origin such a fattening phenomenon does not occur. We also provide some further results
in the case of the fractional mean curvature flow, showing that strictly starshaped sets have a unique
geometric evolution. Moreover, we exhibit two illustrative examples of closed nonregular curves,
the first with a Lipschitz-type singularity and the second with a cusp-type singularity, given
by two tangent circles of equal radius, whose evolution develops fattening in the first case, and
is uniquely defined in the second, thus remarking the high sensitivity of the fattening phenomenon
in terms of the regularity of the initial datum. The latter example is in striking contrast to the
classical case of the (local) curvature flow, where two tangent circles always develop fattening.
As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide also a simple proof of the fact that the cross is not a $K$-minimal
set for the nonlocal perimeter functional associated to $K$.
