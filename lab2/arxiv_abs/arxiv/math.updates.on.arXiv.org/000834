Let $\Gamma=\Gamma(N)$ be a principal congruence subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$. In this paper,
we extend the theory of modular Hecke algebras due to Connes and Moscovici to define the algebra $\mathcal
Q(\Gamma)$ of quasimodular Hecke operators of level $\Gamma$. Then, $\mathcal Q(\Gamma)$ carries
an action of ``the Hopf algebra $\mathcal H_1$ of codimension $1$ foliations'' that also acts on
the modular Hecke algebra $\mathcal A(\Gamma)$ of Connes and Moscovici. However, in the case of
quasimodular Hecke algebras, we have several additional operators and we can describe them in terms
of a new Hopf algebra $\mathcal H$ acting on $\mathcal Q(\Gamma)$. Further, for each $\sigma\in
SL_2(\mathbb Z)$, we introduce the collection $\mathcal Q_\sigma(\Gamma)$ of quasimodular Hecke
operators of level $\Gamma$ twisted by $\sigma$. Then, $\mathcal Q_\sigma(\Gamma)$ is a right
$\mathcal Q(\Gamma)$-module and is endowed with a pairing $(\_\_,\_\_):\mathcal Q_\sigma(\Gamma)\otimes
\mathcal Q_\sigma(\Gamma)\longrightarrow \mathcal Q_\sigma(\Gamma)$. We show that there is
a ``Hopf action'' of a certain Hopf algebra $\mathfrak{h}_1$ on the pairing on $\mathcal Q_\sigma(\Gamma)$.
Finally, for any $\sigma\in SL_2(\mathbb Z)$, we consider operators acting between the levels
of the graded module $\mathbb Q_\sigma(\Gamma)=\underset{m\in \mathbb Z}{\oplus}\mathcal
Q_{\sigma(m)}(\Gamma)$, where $\sigma(m)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & m \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}\cdot
\sigma$ for any $m\in \mathbb Z$. The pairing on $\mathcal Q_\sigma(\Gamma)$ can be extended to
a graded pairing on $\mathbb Q_\sigma(\Gamma)$ and we show that there is a Hopf action of a larger
Hopf algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{\mathbb Z}\supseteq \mathfrak{h}_1$ on the pairing on $\mathbb
Q_\sigma(\Gamma)$.
