Let $p$ denote the characteristic of ${\mathbb F}_q$, the finite field with $q$ elements. We prove
that if $q$ is odd then an arc of size $q+2-t$ in the projective plane over ${\mathbb F}_q$, which is
not contained in a conic, is contained in the intersection of two curves, which do not share a common
component, and have degree at most $t+p^{\lfloor \log_p t \rfloor}$, provided a certain technical
condition on $t$ is satisfied. This implies that if $q$ is odd then an arc of size at least $q-\sqrt{q}+\sqrt{q}/p+3$
is contained in a conic if $q$ is square and an arc of size at least $q-\sqrt{q}+\frac{7}{2}$ is contained
in a conic if $q$ is prime. This is of particular interest in the case that $q$ is an odd square, since
then there are examples of arcs, not contained in a conic, of size $q-\sqrt{q}+1$, and it has long
been conjectured that if $q \neq 9$ is an odd square then any larger arc is contained in a conic. These
bounds improve on previously known bounds when $q$ is an odd square and for primes less than $1783$.
The previously known bounds, obtained by Segre \cite{Segre1967}, Hirschfeld and Korchm\'aros
\cite{HK1996} \cite{HK1998}, and Voloch \cite{Voloch1990b} \cite{Voloch1991}, rely on results
on the number of points on algebraic curves over finite fields, in particular the Hasse-Weil theorem
and the St\"ohr-Voloch theorem, and are based on Segre's idea to associate an algebraic curve in
the dual plane containing the tangents to an arc. In this paper we do not rely on such theorems, but
use a new approach starting from a scaled coordinate-free version of Segre's lemma of tangents.
Arcs in the projective plane over ${\mathbb F}_q$ of size $q$ and $q+1$, $q$ odd, were classified
by Segre \cite{Segre1955b} in 1955. In this article, we complete the classification of arcs of size
$q-1$ and $q-2$.
