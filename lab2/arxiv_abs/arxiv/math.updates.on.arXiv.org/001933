We consider the evolution of multi-pulse patterns in an extended Klausmeier equation with parameters
that change in time and/or space. We formally show that the full PDE dynamics of a $N$-pulse configuration
can be reduced to a $N$-dimensional dynamical system describing the dynamics on a $N$-dimensional
manifold $\mathcal{M}_N$. Next, we determine the local stability of $\mathcal{M}_N$ via the quasi-steady
spectrum associated to evolving $N$-pulse patterns, which provides provides explicit information
on the boundary $\partial\mathcal{M}_N$. Following the dynamics on $\mathcal{M}_N$, a $N$-pulse
pattern may move through $\partial\mathcal{M}_N$ and `fall off' $\mathcal{M}_N$. A direct nonlinear
extrapolation of our linear analysis predicts the subsequent fast PDE dynamics as the pattern `jumps'
to another invariant manifold $\mathcal{M}_M$, and specifically predicts the number $N-M$ of
pulses that disappear. Combining the asymptotic analysis with numerical simulations of the dynamics
on the various invariant manifolds yields a hybrid asymptotic-numerical method describing the
full process that starts with a $N$-pulse pattern and typically ends in the trivial homogeneous
state without pulses. We extensively test this method against PDE simulations and deduce general
conjectures on the nature of pulse interactions with disappearing pulses. We especially consider
the differences between the evolution of irregular and regular patterns. In the former case, the
disappearing process is gradual: irregular patterns loose their pulses one by one. In contrast,
regular, spatially periodic, patterns undergo catastrophic transitions in which either half
or all pulses disappear. However, making a precise distinction between these two drastically different
processes is quite subtle, since irregular $N$-pulse patterns that do not cross $\partial\mathcal{M}_N$
typically evolve towards regularity.
