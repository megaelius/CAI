This article focuses on solving the generalized eigenvalue problems (GEP) arising in the source-free
Maxwell equation with magnetoelectric coupling effects that models three-dimensional complex
media. The goal is to compute the smallest positive eigenvalues, and the main challenge is that the
coefficient matrix in the discrete Maxwell equation is indefinite and degenerate. To overcome
this difficulty, we derive a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the discrete single-curl operator
and then explicitly express the basis of the invariant subspace corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalues
of the GEP. Consequently, we reduce the GEP to a null space free standard eigenvalue problem (NFSEP)
that contains only the nonzero (complex) eigenvalues of the GEP and can be solved by the shift-and-invert
Arnoldi method without being disturbed by the null space. Furthermore, the basis of the eigendecomposition
is chosen carefully so that we can apply fast Fourier transformation (FFT)-based matrix vector
multiplication to solve the embedded linear systems efficiently by an iterative method. For chiral
and pseudochiral complex media, which are of great interest in magnetoelectric applications,
the NFSEP can be further transformed to a null space free generalized eigenvalue problem whose coefficient
matrices are Hermitian and Hermitian positive definite (HHPD-NFGEP). This HHPD-NFGEP can be solved
by using the invert Lanczos method without shifting. Furthermore, the embedded linear system can
be solved efficiently by using the conjugate gradient method without preconditioning and the FFT-based
matrix vector multiplications. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency
of the proposed methods.
