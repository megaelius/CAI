The travelling thief problem (TTP) is a representative of multi-component optimisation problems
with interacting components. TTP combines the knapsack problem (KP) and the travelling salesman
problem (TSP). A thief performs a cyclic tour through a set of cities, and pursuant to a collection
plan, collects a subset of items into a rented knapsack with finite capacity. The aim is to maximise
profit while minimising renting cost. Existing TTP solvers typically solve the KP and TSP components
in an interleaved manner: the solution of one component is kept fixed while the solution of the other
component is modified. This suggests low coordination between solving the two components, possibly
leading to low quality TTP solutions. The 2-OPT heuristic is often used for solving the TSP component,
which reverses a segment in the tour. Within TTP, 2-OPT does not take into account the collection
plan, which can result in a lower objective value. This in turn can result in the tour modification
to be rejected by a solver. We propose an expanded form of 2-OPT to change the collection plan in coordination
with tour modification. Items regarded as less profitable and collected in cities located earlier
in the reversed segment are substituted by items that tend to be more profitable and not collected
in cities located later in the reversed segment. The collection plan is further changed through
a modified form of the hill-climbing bit-flip search, where changes in the collection state are
only permitted for boundary items, which are defined as lowest profitable collected items or highest
profitable uncollected items. This restriction reduces the time spent on the KP component, allowing
more tours to be evaluated by the TSP component within a time budget. The proposed approaches form
the basis of a new cooperative coordination solver, which is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art
TTP solvers.
