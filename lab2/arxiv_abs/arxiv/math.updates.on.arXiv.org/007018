Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems allowing people to interact with the environment
bypassing the natural neuromuscular and hormonal outputs of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
These interfaces record a user's brain activity and translate it into control commands for external
devices, thus providing the PNS with additional artificial outputs. In this framework, the BCIs
based on the P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP), which represent the electrical responses recorded
from the brain after specific events or stimuli, have proven to be particularly successful and robust.
The presence or the absence of a P300 evoked potential within the EEG features is determined through
a classification algorithm. Linear classifiers such as SWLDA and SVM are the most used for ERPs'
classification. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG signals, multiple stimulation
sequences (a.k.a. iterations) are carried out and then averaged before the signals being classified.
However, while augmenting the number of iterations improves the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR),
it also slows down the process. In the early studies, the number of iterations was fixed (no stopping),
but recently, several early stopping strategies have been proposed in the literature to dynamically
interrupt the stimulation sequence when a certain criterion is met to enhance the communication
rate. In this work, we explore how to improve the classification performances in P300 based BCIs
by combining optimization and machine learning. First, we propose a new decision function that
aims at improving classification performances in terms of accuracy and Information Transfer Rate
both in a no stopping and early stopping environment. Then, we propose a new SVM training problem
that aims to facilitate the target-detection process. Our approach proves to be effective on several
publicly available datasets.
