We introduce the concept of {\it mean-field optimal control} which is the rigorous limit process
connecting finite dimensional optimal control problems with ODE constraints modeling multi-agent
interactions to an infinite dimensional optimal control problem with a constraint given by a PDE
of Vlasov-type, governing the dynamics of the probability distribution of interacting agents.
While in the classical mean-field theory one studies the behavior of a large number of small individuals
{\it freely interacting} with each other, by simplifying the effect of all the other individuals
on any given individual by a single averaged effect, we address the situation where the individuals
are actually influenced also by an external {\it policy maker}, and we propagate its effect for the
number $N$ of individuals going to infinity. On the one hand, from a modeling point of view, we take
into account also that the policy maker is constrained to act according to optimal strategies promoting
its most parsimonious interaction with the group of individuals. This will be realized by considering
cost functionals including $L^1$-norm terms penalizing a broadly distributed control of the group,
while promoting its sparsity. On the other hand, from the analysis point of view, and for the sake
of generality, we consider broader classes of convex control penalizations. In order to develop
this new concept of limit rigorously, we need to carefully combine the classical concept of mean-field
limit, connecting the finite dimensional system of ODE describing the dynamics of each individual
of the group to the PDE describing the dynamics of the respective probability distribution, with
the well-known concept of $\Gamma$-convergence to show that optimal strategies for the finite
dimensional problems converge to optimal strategies of the infinite dimensional problem.
