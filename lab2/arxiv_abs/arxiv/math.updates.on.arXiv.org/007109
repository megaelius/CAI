B-spline collocation techniques have been applied to Schr\"odinger's equation since the early
1970s, but one aspect that is noticeably missing from this literature is the use of Gaussian points
(i.e., the zeros of Legendre polynomials) as the collocation points, which can significantly reduce
approximation errors. Authors in the past have used equally spaced or nonlinearly distributed
collocation points (noticing that the latter can increase approximation accuracy) but, strangely,
have continued to avoid Gaussian collocation points. Using the methodology and computer routines
provided by Carl de Boor's book A Practical Guide to Splines as a `numerical laboratory', the present
dissertation examines how the use of Gaussian points can interact with other features such as box
size, mesh size and the order of polynomial approximants to affect the accuracy of approximations
to Schr\"odinger's bound state wave functions for the electron in the hydrogen atom. We explore
whether or not, and under what circumstances, B-spline collocation at Gaussian points can produce
more accurate approximations to Schr\"odinger's wave functions than equally spaced and nonlinearly
distributed collocation points. We also apply B-spline collocation at Gaussian points to a Schr\"odinger
equation with cubic nonlinearity which has been used extensively in the past to study nonlinear
phenomena. Our computer experiments show that collocation at Gaussian points can be a highly successful
approach for the hydrogen atom, consistently superior to equally spaced collocation points and
often superior to nonlinearly distributed collocation points. However, we do encounter some situations,
typically when the mesh is quite coarse relative to the box size for the hydrogen atom, and also in
the cubic Schr\"odinger equation case, in which nonlinearly distributed collocation points perform
better than Gaussian collocation points.
