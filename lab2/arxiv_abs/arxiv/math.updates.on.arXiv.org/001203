We present a fluctuating boundary integral method (FBIM) for Brownian Dynamics of suspensions
of rigid particles of complex shape immersed in a Stokes fluid. We develop a linear-scaling algorithm
to generate, together, both the deterministic (mean) component of the particle linear and angular
velocities that arise in response to the applied forces and torques, as well as the stochastic (fluctuating)
Brownian displacements that arise in response to the thermal fluctuations in the fluid. In this
work we restrict our attention to two-dimensional periodic domains, however, our key ideas can
be extended to three dimensions and confined suspensions. Our approach relies on a first-kind boundary
integral formulation of a Stochastic Stokes Boundary Value Problem (SSBVP) in which a random surface
velocity is prescribed on the particle surface. This random surface velocity has zero mean and covariance
proportional to the Green's function for the Stokes flow (Stokeslet). We demonstrate that the Brownian
displacements generated by solving this SSBVP obey the fluctuation-dissipation balance relation.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that discretizing the first-kind formulation using standard boundary
integral techniques leads to an efficient numerical method that strictly preserves discrete fluctuation-dissipation
balance (DFDB). Near-field contributions to the Brownian displacements are efficiently approximated
by iterative methods in real space, while far-field contributions are rapidly generated by fast
Fourier-space methods based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. FBIM provides the key ingredient for
time integration of the overdamped Langevin equations for Brownian suspensions of rigid particles.
We demonstrate that FBIM obeys DFDB by performing equilibrium BD simulations of suspensions of
starfish-shaped bodies using a random finite difference temporal integrator.
