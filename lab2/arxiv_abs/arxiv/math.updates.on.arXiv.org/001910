Consider an elliptic parameter $k$; we introduce a family of $Z^u$-Dirac operators $(\mathsf{K}(u))_{u\in\Re(\mathbb{T}(k))}$,
relate them to the $Z$-massive Laplacian of [BdTR17b], and extend to the full $Z$-invariant case
the results of Kenyon [Ken02] on discrete holomorphic and harmonic functions, which correspond
to the case $k=0$. We prove, in a direct statistical mechanics way, how and why the $Z^u$-Dirac and
$Z$-massive Laplacian operators appear in the $Z$-invariant Ising model, considering the case
of infinite and finite isoradial graphs. More precisely, consider the dimer model on the Fisher
graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{F}}}$ arising from a $Z$-invariant Ising
model. We express coefficients of the inverse Fisher Kasteleyn operator as a function of the inverse
$Z^u$-Dirac operator and also as a function of the $Z$-massive Green function; in particular this
proves a (massive) random walk representation of important observables of the Ising model. We prove
that the squared partition function of the Ising model is equal, up to a constant, to the determinant
of the $Z$-massive Laplacian operator with specific boundary conditions, the latter being the
partition function of rooted spanning forests. To show these results, we relate the inverse Fisher
Kasteleyn operator and that of the dimer model on the bipartite graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$
arising from the XOR-Ising model, and we prove matrix identities between the Kasteleyn matrix of
${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$ and the $Z^u$-Dirac operator, that allow
to reach inverse matrices as well as determinants.
