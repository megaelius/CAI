Generalization of Pascal's triangle and its fascinating properties attract the attention of many
researchers from the very beginning. Sir Isaac Newton first observed that the first five rows of
Pascal's triangle can be generated from the power of 11 and gave a hypothesis of generating the subsequent
rows of Pascal's triangle by the power of 11. The hypothesis later proved by Arnold but the visualization
of the rows was restricted till the $5^{\text{th}}$ row due to the limitation of 11. In a study, Morton
showed that an immediately preceding row can be generated by dividing each row (considering multi-digit
numerals as single place value) by $11$, but he didn't give any general formula for constructing
the entire row. In prior studies, it has been found that the concept of 11 was unable to generate the
elements of Pascal's triangle which are consisting of two or more digits. In this study, the visualization
of each row of Pascal's triangle has been presented by extending the prior concept of 11 to 101, 1001,
10001, and so on. A general formula is derived to generate any row of Pascal's triangle as an extension
of the concept of $\left(11\right)^{n}$. We briefly discussed how our proposed concept works for
any $n$ by inserting an appropriate number of zeros between $1$ and $1$ (eleven), that is the concept
of $\left(11\right)^{n}$ has been extended to $\left(1\Theta1\right)^{n}$, where $\Theta$
represents the number of zeros. We have proposed a formula for obtaining the value of $\Theta$. The
proposed concept has been verified with Pascal's triangle and matched successfully. Finally,
using our proposed general formula Pascal's triangle for a large n has been presented considering
the $51^{\text{st}}$ row as an example.
