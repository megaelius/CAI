From the point of view of optimization, a critical issue is relating the combinatorial diameter
of a polyhedron to its number of facets $f$ and dimension $d$. In the seminal paper of Klee and Walkup
[KW67], the Hirsch conjecture of an upper bound of $f-d$ was shown to be equivalent to several seemingly
simpler statements, and was disproved for unbounded polyhedra through the construction of a particular
4-dimensional polyhedron $U_4$ with 8 facets. The Hirsch bound for bounded polyhedra was only recently
disproved by Santos. We consider analogous properties for a variant of the combinatorial diameter
called the circuit diameter. In this variant, the walks are built from the circuit directions of
the polyhedron, which are the minimal non-trivial solutions to the system defining the polyhedron.
We are able to prove that circuit variants of the so-called non-revisiting conjecture and $d$-step
conjecture both imply the circuit analogue of the Hirsch conjecture. For the equivalences in [KW67],
the wedge construction was a fundamental proof technique. We exhibit why it is not available in the
circuit setting, and what are the implications of losing it as a tool. Further, we show the circuit
analogue of the non-revisiting conjecture implies a linear bound on the circuit diameter of all
unbounded polyhedra - in contrast to what is known for the combinatorial diameter. Finally, we give
two proofs of a circuit version of the $4$-step conjecture. These results offer some hope that the
circuit version of the Hirsch conjecture may hold in general. A challenge in the circuit setting
is that different realizations of polyhedra of the same combinatorial structure may have different
diameters. We adapt the notion of simplicity to work with circuits in the form of C-simple and wedge-simple
polyhedra. We show that it suffices to consider such polyhedra.
