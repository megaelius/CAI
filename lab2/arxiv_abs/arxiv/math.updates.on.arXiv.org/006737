Non-adversarial generative models such as variational auto-encoder (VAE), Wasserstein auto-encoders
with maximum mean discrepancy (WAE-MMD), sliced-Wasserstein auto-encoder (SWAE) are relatively
easy to train and have less mode collapse compared to Wasserstein auto-encoder with generative
adversarial network (WAE-GAN). However, they are not very accurate in approximating the target
distribution in the latent space because they don't have a discriminator to detect the minor difference
between real and fake. To this end, we develop a novel non-adversarial framework called Tessellated
Wasserstein Auto-encoders (TWAE) to tessellate the support of the target distribution into a given
number of regions by the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) technique and design batches of
data according to the tessellation instead of random shuffling for accurate computation of discrepancy.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that the error of estimate to the discrepancy decreases when the
numbers of samples $n$ and regions $m$ of the tessellation become larger with rates of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$
and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}})$, respectively. Given fixed $n$ and $m$, a necessary condition
for the upper bound of measurement error to be minimized is that the tessellation is the one determined
by CVT. TWAE is very flexible to different non-adversarial metrics and can substantially enhance
their generative performance in terms of Fr\'{e}chet inception distance (FID) compared to VAE,
WAE-MMD, SWAE. Moreover, numerical results indeed demonstrate that TWAE is competitive to the
adversarial model WAE-GAN, demonstrating its powerful generative ability.
