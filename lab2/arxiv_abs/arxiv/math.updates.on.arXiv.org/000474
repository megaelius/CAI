We study the problem of embedding a guest graph with minimum edge-congestion into a multidimensional
grid with the same size as that of the guest graph. Based on a well-known notion of graph separators,
we show that an embedding with a smaller edge-congestion can be obtained if the guest graph has a smaller
separator, and if the host grid has a higher but constant dimension. Specifically, we prove that
any graph with $N$ nodes, maximum node degree $\Delta$, and with a node-separator of size $O(n^\alpha)$
($0\leq\alpha<1$) can be embedded into a grid of a fixed dimension $d\geq 2$ with at least $N$
nodes, with an edge-congestion of $O(\Delta)$ if $d>1/(1-\alpha)$, $O(\Delta\log N)$ if $d=1/(1-\alpha)$,
and $O(\Delta N^{\alpha-1+\frac{1}{d}})$ if $d< 1/(1-\alpha)$. This edge-congestion achieves
constant ratio approximation if $d>1/(1-\alpha)$, and matches an existential lower bound
within a constant factor if $d\leq 1/(1-\alpha)$. Our result implies that if the guest graph has
an excluded minor of a fixed size, such as a planar graph, then we can obtain an edge-congestion of
$O(\Delta\log N)$ for $d=2$ and $O(\Delta)$ for any fixed $d\geq 3$. Moreover, if the guest graph
has a fixed treewidth, such as a tree, an outerplanar graph, and a series-parallel graph, then we
can obtain an edge-congestion of $O(\Delta)$ for any fixed $d\geq 2$. To design our embedding algorithm,
we introduce edge-separators bounding expansion, such that in partitioning a graph into isolated
nodes using edge-separators recursively, the number of outgoing edges from a subgraph to be partitioned
in a recursive step is bounded. We present an algorithm to construct an edge-separator with expansion
of $O(\Delta n^\alpha)$ from a node-separator of size $O(n^\alpha)$.
