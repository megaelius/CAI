This work is devoted to the construction of weakly nonlinear, highly oscillating, current vortex
sheet solutions to the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations. Current vortex sheets
are piecewise smooth solutions to the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations that satisfy
suitable jump conditions for the velocity and magnetic field on the (free) discontinuity surface.
In this work, we complete an earlier work by Ali and Hunter and construct approximate solutions at
any arbitrarily large order of accuracy to the free boundary problem in three space dimensions when
the initial discontinuity displays high frequency oscillations. As evidenced in earlier works,
high frequency oscillations of the current vortex sheet give rise to `surface waves' on either side
of the sheet. Such waves decay exponentially in the normal direction to the current vortex sheet
and, in the weakly nonlinear regime that we consider here, their leading amplitude is governed by
a nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobitype equation known as the `HIZ equation' (standing for Hamilton-Il'insky-Zabolotskaya)
in the context of Rayleigh waves in elastodynamics. The main achievement of our work is to develop
a systematic approach for constructing arbitrarily many correctors to the leading amplitude.
Based on a suitable duality formula, we exhibit necessary and sufficient solvability conditions
for the corrector equations that need to be solved iteratively. Theverification of these solvability
conditions is based on a combination of mere algebra and arguments of combinatorial analysis. The
construction of arbitrarily many correctors enables us to produce infinitely accurate approximate
solutions to the free boundary problem. Eventually, we show that the rectification phenomenon
exhibited by Marcou in the context of Rayleigh waves does not arise in the same way for the current
vortex sheet problem.
