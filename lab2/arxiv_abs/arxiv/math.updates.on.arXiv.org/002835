This work initiates the efforts to design an intelligent/cognitive nano receiver operating in
Terahertz (THz) band. Specifically, we investigate two essential ingredients of an intelligent
nano receiver---modulation mode detection (to differentiate between pulse based modulation
and carrier based modulation), and modulation classification (to identify the exact modulation
scheme in use). To implement modulation mode detection, we construct a binary hypothesis test in
nano-receiver's passband, and provide closed-form expressions for the two error probabilities.
As for modulation classification, we aim to represent the received signal of interest by a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM). This necessitates the explicit estimation of the THz channel impulse response,
and its subsequent compensation (via deconvolution). We then learn the GMM parameters via Expectation-Maximization
algorithm. We then do Gaussian approximation of each mixture density to compute symmetric Kullback-Leibler
divergence in order to differentiate between various modulation schemes (i.e., $M$-ary phase
shift keying, $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation). The simulation results on mode detection
indicate that there exists a unique Pareto-optimal point (for both SNR and the decision threshold)
where both error probabilities are minimized. The main takeaway message by the simulation results
on modulation classification is that for a pre-specified probability of correct classification,
higher SNR is required to correctly identify a higher order modulation scheme. On a broader note,
this work should trigger the interest of the community in the design of intelligent/cognitive nano
receivers (capable of performing various intelligent tasks, e.g., modulation prediction etc.).
