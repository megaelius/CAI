In this paper we introduce constructible analogs of the discrete complexity classes $\mathbf{VP}$
and $\mathbf{VNP}$ of sequences of functions. The functions in the new definitions are constructible
functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{C}^n$. We define a class of sequences of constructible
functions that play a role analogous to that of $\mathbf{VP}$ in the more classical theory. The class
analogous to $\mathbf{VNP}$ is defined using Euler integration. We discuss several examples,
develop a theory of completeness, and pose a conjecture analogous to the $\mathbf{VP}$ vs. $\mathbf{VNP}$
conjecture in the classical case. In the second part of the paper we extend the notions of complexity
classes to sequences of constructible sheaves over $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or its one point compactification).
We introduce a class of sequences of simple constructible sheaves, that could be seen as the sheaf-theoretic
analog of the Blum-Shub-Smale class $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbb{R}}$. We also define a hierarchy of
complexity classes of sheaves mirroring the polynomial hierarchy, $\mathbf{PH}_{\mathbb{R}}$,
in the B-S-S theory. We prove a singly exponential upper bound on the topological complexity of the
sheaves in this hierarchy mirroring a similar result in the B-S-S setting. We obtain as a result an
algorithm with singly exponential complexity for a sheaf-theoretic variant of the real quantifier
elimination problem. We pose the natural sheaf-theoretic analogs of the classical $\mathbf{P}$
vs. $\mathbf{NP}$ question, and also discuss a connection with Toda's theorem from discrete complexity
theory in the context of constructible sheaves. We also discuss possible generalizations of the
questions in complexity theory related to separation of complexity classes to more general categories
via sequences of adjoint pairs of functors.
