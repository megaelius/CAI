BACKGROUND. Epidemic models of STIs are often used to characterize the contribution of risk groups
to overall transmission by projecting the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF)
of unmet prevention and treatment needs within risk groups. However, evidence suggests that STI
risk is dynamic over an individual's sexual life course, which manifests as turnover between risk
groups. We sought to examine the mechanisms by which turnover influences modelled projections
of the tPAF of high risk groups. METHODS. We developed a unifying, data-guided framework to simulate
risk group turnover in deterministic, compartmental transmission models. We applied the framework
to an illustrative model of an STI and examined the mechanisms by which risk group turnover influenced
equilibrium prevalence across risk groups. We then fit a model with and without turnover to the same
risk-stratified STI prevalence targets and compared the inferred level of risk heterogeneity
and tPAF of the highest risk group projected by the two models. RESULTS. The influence of turnover
on group-specific prevalence was mediated by three main phenomena: movement of infectious individuals
between risk groups; changes to herd immunity; and changes in discordant partnerships. Faster
turnover led to a smaller ratio of STI prevalence between the highest and lowest risk groups. Compared
to the fitted model without turnover, the fitted model with turnover inferred greater risk heterogeneity
and consistently projected a larger tPAF of the highest risk group over time. IMPLICATIONS. If turnover
is not captured in epidemic models, the projected contribution of high risk groups, and thus, the
potential impact of prioritizing interventions to address their needs, could be underestimated.
To aid the next generation of tPAF models, data collection efforts to parameterize risk group turnover
should be prioritized.
