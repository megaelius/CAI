This paper describes wideband (1 GHz) base station diversity and coordinated multipoint (CoMP)-style
large-scale measurements at 73 GHz in an urban microcell open square scenario in downtown Brooklyn,
New York on the NYU campus. The measurements consisted of ten random receiver locations at pedestrian
level (1.4 meters) and ten random transmitter locations at lamppost level (4.0 meters) that provided
36 individual transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) combinations. For each of the 36 radio links, extensive
directional measurements were made to give insights into small-cell base station diversity at
millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. High-gain steerable horn antennas with 7-degree and 15-degree
half-power beamwidths (HPBW) were used at the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), respectively.
For each TX-RX combination, the TX antenna was scanned over a 120-degree sector and the RX antenna
was scanned over the entire azimuth plane at the strongest RX elevation plane and two other elevation
planes on both sides of the strongest elevation angle, separated by the 15-degree HPBW. Directional
and omnidirectional path loss models were derived and match well with the literature. Signal reception
probabilities derived from the measurements for one to five base stations that served a single RX
location show significant coverage improvement over all potential beamformed RX antenna pointing
angles. CDFs for nearest neighbor and Best-N omnidirectional path loss and cell outage probabilities
for directional antennas provide insights into coverage and interference for future mmWave small-cells
that will exploit macro-diversity and CoMP.
