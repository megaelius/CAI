Let $H$ be a monoid. Given $k\in\bf N$, we denote by $\mathscr U_k$ the set of all $\ell\in{\bf N}^+$
such that $a_1\cdots a_k=b_1\cdots b_\ell$ for some atoms $a_1,\ldots,a_k,b_1,\ldots,b_\ell\in
H$. The unions $\mathscr U_k$ are one of the fundamental invariants studied in factorization theory,
and understanding their structure is a basic problem in the field: In particular, it is known that,
in many cases, the sets $\mathscr U_k$ are AAPs with the same difference and bound for all large $k$,
which is expressed by saying that $H$ satisfies the Structure Theorem. This paper considerably
improves the current state of the art on the structure of the sets $\mathscr U_k$. Most notably, we
show that, under mild assumptions, $H$ satisfies the following strengthened version of the Structure
Theorem: There are $m\in{\bf N}^+$ and finite sets $\mathscr U_0^\prime,\mathscr U_0^{\prime\prime},\ldots,\mathscr
U_{m-1}^\prime,\mathscr U_{m-1}^{\prime\prime}\subseteq\bf N$ such that, for all but finitely
many $k$, $$\mathscr U_k=\bigl(\inf \mathscr U_k + \mathscr U_{k \bmod m}^\prime\bigr)\uplus\mathscr
P_k\uplus\bigl(\sup\mathscr U_k-\mathscr U_{k \bmod m}^{\prime\prime}\bigr)\subseteq k+\delta\cdot{\bf
Z},$$ where $\mathscr P_k$ is an AP with difference $\delta$, with $\delta\in{\bf N}^+$ depending
only on $H$. The last result applies, in the first place, to all commutative Krull domains with finite
class group (such as the ring of integers of a number field); a variety of weakly Krull commutative
domains (including all orders in number fields with finite elasticity); certain maximal orders
in central simple algebras over global fields; and every numerical monoid. Proofs are worked out
in a "purely additive setting", by inquiring into the properties of families $\mathscr L$ of subsets
of $\bf N$ such that, if $L_1,L_2\in\mathscr L$, then $L_1+L_2\subseteq L$ for some $L\in\mathscr
L$.
