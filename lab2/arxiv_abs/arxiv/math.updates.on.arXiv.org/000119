We continue our study of the parabolic Anderson equation $\partial u(x,t)/\partial t = \kappa\Delta
u(x,t) + \xi(x,t)u(x,t)$, $x\in\Z^d$, $t\geq 0$, where $\kappa \in [0,\infty)$ is the diffusion
constant, $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian, and $\xi$ plays the role of a \emph{dynamic random
environment} that drives the equation. The initial condition $u(x,0)=u_0(x)$, $x\in\Z^d$, is
taken to be non-negative and bounded. The solution of the parabolic Anderson equation describes
the evolution of a field of particles performing independent simple random walks with binary branching:
particles jump at rate $2d\kappa$, split into two at rate $\xi \vee 0$, and die at rate $(-\xi) \vee
0$. We assume that $\xi$ is stationary and ergodic under translations in space and time, is not constant
and satisfies $\E(|\xi(0,0)|)<\infty$, where $\E$ denotes expectation w.r.t.\ $\xi$. Our
main object of interest is the \emph{quenched Lyapunov exponent} $\lambda_0 (\kappa) = \lim_{t\to\infty}
\frac{1}{t}\log u(0,t)$. In earlier work \cite{GdHM11,EdHM12} we showed that under certain mild
space-time mixing assumptions the limit exists, is finite and continuous on $[0,\infty)$, is globally
Lipschitz on $(0,\infty)$, is not Lipschitz at 0, and satisfies $\lambda_0(0) = \E(\xi(0,0))$
and $\lambda_0(\kappa) > \E(\xi(0,0))$ for $\kappa \in (0,\infty)$.In the present paper we
show that $\kappa \mapsto \lambda_0(\kappa)$ is bounded. This is interesting because there are
choices of $\xi$ satisfying our space-time mixing and noisiness conditions for which the \emph{annealed
Lyapunov exponent} $\lambda_1 (\kappa) = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t}\log \E(u(0,t))$ is
infinite on $[0,\infty)$, a situation that is referred to as \emph{strongly catalytic} behavior.
Our proof is based on a multiscale analysis of $\xi$ in combination with discrete rearrangement
inequalities for local times of simple random walk.
