In this paper we introduce the notion of Poincar\'e DGCAs of Hodge type, which is a subclass of Poincar\'e
DGCAs encompassing the de Rham algebras of closed orientable manifolds. Then we introduce the notion
of the small algebra and the small quotient algebra of a Poincar\'e DGCA of Hodge type. Using these
concepts, we investigate the equivalence class of $(r-1)$ connected $(r>1)$ Poincar\'e DGCAs
of Hodge type. In particular, we show that a $(r-1)$ connected Poincar\'e DGCA of Hodge type ${\mathcal
A}^\ast$ of dimension $n \le 5r-3$ is $A_\infty$-quasi-isomorphic to an $A_3$-algebra and prove
that the only obstruction to the formality of ${\mathcal A}^\ast$ is a distinguished Harrison cohomology
class $[\mu_3] \in {\mathsf{Harr}}^{3,-1} (H^*({\mathcal A}^\ast), H^*({\mathcal A}^\ast))$.
Moreover, the cohomology class $[\mu_3]$ and the DGCA isomorphism class of $H^*({\mathcal A}^\ast)$
determine the $A_\infty$-quasi-isomorphism class of ${\mathcal A}^\ast$. This can be seen as
a Harrison cohomology version of the Crowley-Nordstr\"om results [D. Crowley, J. Nordstr\"om,
The rational homotopy type of $(n-1)$-connected manifolds of dimension up to $5n-3$, arXiv:1505.04184v2]
on rational homotopy type of $(r-1)$-connected $(r>1)$ closed manifolds of dimension up to $5r-3$.
We also derive the almost formality of closed $G_2$-manifolds, which have been discovered recently
by Chan-Karigiannis-Tsang in [K.F. Chan, S. Karigiannis and C.C. Tsang, The ${\mathcal L}_B$-cohomology
on compact torsion-free ${\rm G}_2$ manifolds and an application to `almost' formality, arXiv:1801.06410,
to appear in Ann. Global Anal. Geom.], from our results and the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem.
