New non trivial solutions to the Lorentzian-signature symmetry reduced Bianchi VIII Wheeler DeWitt
equation for Hartle Hawking ordering parameters $ \pm 2\sqrt{33} $ are obtained using an Euclidean-signature
semi classical method. Using the aforementioned method we define 'excited' states for the Bianchi
VIII wave function and construct leading order 'excited' states which appear to be a hybrid of scattering
and bound states. Also six new solutions for the $\Lambda \ne 0$ Bianchi VIII Euclidean-signature
Hamilton Jacobi equation are presented which can be used to construct semi-classical states corresponding
to the Lorentzian signature symmetry reduced Wheeler DeWitt equation. In addition, new solutions
to the Euclidean-signature Hamilton Jacobi equation for the Bianchi VIII models are found when
$\Lambda \ne 0$ and an aligned primordial magnetic field is present. Furthermore, we find eight
new complex solutions to the Euclidean-signature Hamilton Jacobi equation for the case when matter
is not present, which can be used to construct additional semi-classical states. We also study the
leading order wave functions which result from our aforementioned solutions when they are restricted
to the $\beta+$ axis. Prior to presenting these results we explain the Euclidean-signature semi
classical method and discuss how to solve the resultant equations this method generates when it
is applied to the Lorentzian-signature symmetry reduced Bianchi VIII Wheeler DeWitt equation.
The Euclidean-signature semi-classical method used here is applicable to other field theories
as well. The work presented throughout this paper further shows the power Eulclidean-signature
semi classical methods possess for solving problems in quantum cosmology and solving Lorentzian
signature problems in general.
