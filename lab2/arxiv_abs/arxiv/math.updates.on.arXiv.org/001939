Mixed (time-consistent) equilibrium solution is proposed in this paper for the time-inconsistent
mean-field stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control. In Example 2 of Section 5, for all the
time-state initial pairs the mixed equilibrium solution must exist and ten of such solutions can
be constructed, while it is shown that the open-loop equilibrium control and the feedback equilibrium
strategy must not exist for some initial pairs. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mixed equilibrium
solution, which will give us more flexibility to deal with the time-inconsistent optimal control.
A mixed equilibrium solution contains two different parts: the pure-feedback-strategy part and
the open-loop-control part, which together constitute a time-consistent solution. It is shown
that the open-loop-control part will be of the feedback form of the equilibrium state. If we let the
pure-feedback-strategy part or the feedback gain of open-loop-control part be zero, then the mixed
equilibrium solution will reduce to the standard open-loop equilibrium control and the feedback
equilibrium strategy, respectively, both of which have been extensively studied in existing literature.
The fact that a pair of feedback strategy and open-loop control is a mixed equilibrium solution is
fully characterized via the properties of solutions of three sets of difference equations. The
three sets of difference equations are derived to characterize the convexity and stationary condition,
which are obtained via the maximum-principle-like methodology together with the forward-backward
stochastic difference equations. Furthermore, the cases with a fixed initial pair and all the initial
pairs are separately investigated. By applying the derived theory, the multi-period mean-variance
portfolio selection is thoroughly considered, and neat condition has been obtained to ensure the
existence of equilibrium solutions.
