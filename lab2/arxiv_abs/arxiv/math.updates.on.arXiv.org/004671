The family of the complex Grassmann manifolds $G_{n,k}$ with a canonical action of the torus $T^n=\mathbb{T}^{n}$
and the analogue of the moment map $\mu : G_{n,k}\to \Delta _{n,k}$ for the hypersimplex $\Delta
_{n,k}$, is well known. In this paper we study the structure of the orbit space $G_{n,k}/T^n$ by developing
the methods of toric geometry and toric topology. We use a subdivision of $G_{n,k}$ into the strata
$W_{\sigma}$ and determine all regular and singular points of the moment map $\mu$, introduce the
notion of the admissible polytopes $P_\sigma$ such that $\mu (W_{\sigma}) = \stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}}$
and the notion of the spaces of parameters $F_{\sigma}$, which together describe $W_{\sigma}/T^{n}$
as the product $\stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}} \times F_{\sigma}$. To find the appropriate topology
for the set $\cup _{\sigma} \stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}} \times F_{\sigma}$ we introduce the
notions of the universal space of parameters $\tilde{\mathcal{F}}$ and the virtual spaces of parameters
$\tilde{F}_{\sigma}\subset \tilde{\mathcal{F}}$ such that there exist the projections $\tilde{F}_{\sigma}\to
F_{\sigma}$. Hence, we propose a method for the description of the orbit space $G_{n,k}/T^n$. Earlier
we proved that the orbit space $G_{4,2}/T^4$, defined by the canonical $T^4$-action of complexity
$1$, is homeomorphic to $\partial \Delta _{4,2}\ast \mathbb{C} P^1$. We prove here that the orbit
space $G_{5,2}/T^5$, defined by the canonical $T^5$-action of complexity $2$, is homotopy equivalent
to the space obtained by attaching the disc $D^8$ to the space $\Sigma ^{4}\mathbb{R} P^2$ by the
generator of the group $\pi _{7}(\Sigma ^{4}\mathbb{R} P^2)=\mathbb{Z} _{4}$. In particular,
$(G_{5,2}/G_{4,2})/T^5$ is homotopy equivalent to $\partial \Delta _{5,2}\ast \mathbb{C} P^2$.
The methods and the results of this paper are fundaments for our theory of $(2l,q)$-manifolds.
