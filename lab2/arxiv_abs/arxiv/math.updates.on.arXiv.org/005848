The study of complex networks has shown several applications to real-world networks. In this way,
the demand for new graph abstractions in order to deal with multidimensional structures and their
complexities increases. This article presents a theoretical investigation of incompressible
multidimensional networks defined by generalized graph representations. In particular, we mathematically
study the incompressibility (i.e., algorithmic randomness) of snapshot-dynamic networks and
multiplex networks in comparison to the incompressibility of more general forms of multidimensional
networks, from which snapshot-dynamic networks or multiplex networks are particular cases. In
addition, from a worst-case compressibility analysis, we study some of the network topological
properties of general multidimensional networks. To these ends, first we show that incompressible
snapshot-dynamic (or multiplex) networks carry an amount of algorithmic information that is linearly
dominated by the size of the set of time instants (or layers). This contrasts with the algorithmic
information carried by incompressible general dynamic (or multilayer) networks that is of the
quadratic order of the size of the set of time instants (or layers). Furthermore, we show that such
incompressible general multidimensional networks have very short diameter, high k-connectivity,
and degrees of the order of half of the network size within a strong-asymptotically dominated standard
deviation. Then, we show that incompressible general multidimensional networks have transtemporal
(crosslayer or, in general, non-sequential interdimensional) edges, i.e., edges linking vertices
at non-sequential time instants (layers or, in general, elements of a node dimension).
