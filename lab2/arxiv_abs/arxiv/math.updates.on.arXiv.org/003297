We introduce first the large-cardinal notion of $\Sigma_n$-super\-com\-pact\-ness as a higher-level
analog of the well-known Magidor's characterization of supercompact cardinals, and show that
a cardinal is $C^{(n)}$-extendible if and only if it is $\Sigma_{n+1}$-supercompact. We then develop
a general framework for the preservation of $\Sigma_n$-supercompact cardinals under class forcing
iterations and prove a general preservation result. As an application we obtain new proofs of the
consistency of the GCH with $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals (Tsaprounis) and the consistency
of $\rm{VP}$ with the GCH (Brooke-Taylor). Further, $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals are preserved
by forcing with standard Easton-support iterations for any possible $\Pi_1$-definable behaviour
of the power-set function on regular cardinals. We show that one can force proper class-many disagreements
between the universe and HOD with respect to the calculation of successors of regular cardinals,
while preserving $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals. We also show that, assuming the GCH, the class
forcing iteration of Cummings-Foreman-Magidor for forcing $\diamondsuit_{\kappa^+}^+$ at
every $\kappa$ preserves $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals, hence it also preserves $\rm{VP}$.
We finally address the question of the preservation of $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals under general,
not necessarily definable, class forcing iterations $\mathbb{P}$ and show that under minor requirements
on $\mathbb{P}$, every $\mathbb{P}$-$C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal remains $C^{(n)}$-extendible
in any $\mathbb{P}$-generic extension. In particular, when $\mathbb{P}$ is the standard class
forcing that yields $\rm{V}=\rm{HOD}$.
