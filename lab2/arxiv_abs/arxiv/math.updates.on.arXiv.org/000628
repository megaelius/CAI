We introduce the notion of finite BRST-antiBRST transformations for constrained dynamical systems
in the generalized Hamiltonian formalism, both global and field-dependent, with a doublet $\lambda_{a}$,
$a=1,2$, of anticommuting Grassmann parameters and find explicit Jacobians corresponding to
these changes of variables in the path integral. It turns out that the finite transformations are
quadratic in their parameters. Exactly as in the case of finite field-dependent BRST-antiBRST
transformations for the Yang--Mills vacuum functional in the Lagrangian formalism examined in
our previous paper [ arXiv:1405.0790 [hep-th]], special field-dependent BRST-antiBRST transformations
with functionally-dependent parameters $\lambda_{a}=\int dt\ \left( s_{a}\Lambda\right)
$, generated by a finite even-valued function $\Lambda\left( t\right) $ and by the anticommuting
generators $s_{a}$ of BRST-antiBRST transformations, amount to a precise change of the gauge-fixing
functional for arbitrary constrained dynamical systems. This proves the independence of the vacuum
functional under such transformations. We derive a new form of the Ward identities depending on
the parameters $\lambda_{a}$ and study the problem of gauge-dependence. We derive a new form of
the Ward identities depending on the parameters $\lambda_{a}$ and study the problem of gauge-dependence.
We present the form of transformation parameters which generates a change of the gauge in the Hamiltonian
path integral, evaluate it explicitly for connecting two arbitrary $R_{\xi}$-like gauges in the
Yang-Mills theory and establish after integration over momenta coincidence with Lagrangian path
integral [ arXiv:1405.0790 [hep-th]], therefore justifying unitarity of the $S$-matrix in the
Lagrangian approach.
