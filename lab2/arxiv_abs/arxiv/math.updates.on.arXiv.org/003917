We deal with the point-interaction approximations for the acoustic wave fields generated by a cluster
of highly contrasted bubbles for a wide range of densities and bulk moduli contrasts. We derive the
equivalent fields when the cluster of bubbles is appropriately distributed (but not necessarily
periodically) in a bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$. We handle two situations. 1. In the
first one, we distribute the bubbles to occupy a $3$ dimensional domain. For this case, we show that
the equivalent speed of propagation changes sign when the medium is excited with frequencies smaller
or larger than (but not necessarily close to) the Minnaert resonance. As a consequence, this medium
behaves as a reflective or absorbing depending on whether the used frequency is smaller or larger
than this resonance. In addition, if the used frequency is extremely close to this resonance, for
a cluster of bubbles with density above a certain threshold, then the medium behaves as a 'wall',
i.e. allowing no incident sound to penetrate. 2. In the second one, we distribute the bubbles to occupy
a $2$ dimensional (open or closed) surface, not necessarily flat. For this case, we show that the
equivalent medium is modeled by a Dirac potential supported on that surface. The sign of the surface
potential changes for frequencies smaller or larger than the Minnaert resonance, i.e. it behaves
as a smart metasurface reducing or amplifying the transmitted sound across it. As in the $3$D case,
if the used frequency is extremely close to this resonance, for a cluster of bubbles with density
above an appropriate threshold, then the surface allows no incident sound to be transmitted across
the surface, i.e. it behaves as a white screen.
