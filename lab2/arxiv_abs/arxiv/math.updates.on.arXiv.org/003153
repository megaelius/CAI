A framework for coherent pattern extraction and prediction of observables of measure-preserving,
ergodic dynamical systems with both atomic and continuous spectral components is developed. This
framework is based on an approximation of the unbounded generator of the system by a compact operator
$W_\tau$ on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A key element of this approach is that $W_\tau$
is skew-adjoint (unlike regularization approaches based on the addition of diffusion), and thus
can be characterized by a unique projection-valued measure, discrete by compactness, and an associated
orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions can be ordered in terms of a measure
of roughness (Dirichlet energy) on the RKHS, and provide a notion of coherent observables under
the dynamics akin to the Koopman eigenfunctions associated with the atomic part of the spectrum.
In addition, the regularized generator has a well-defined Borel functional calculus allowing
the construction of an associated unitary evolution group $\{ e^{t W_\tau} \}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$
on the RKHS by exponentiation, approximating the unitary Koopman evolution group of the original
system. We establish convergence results for the spectrum and Borel functional calculus of the
regularized generator to those of the original system in the limit $\tau \to 0^+$. Convergence results
are also established for a data-driven formulation, where these operators are approximated using
finite rank operators obtained from observed time series. An advantage of working in spaces of observables
with an RKHS structure is that one can perform pointwise evaluation and interpolation through bounded
linear operators, which is not possible in $L^p$ spaces.
