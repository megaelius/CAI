Let $\Sigma$ be a finite type surface, and $G$ a complex algebraic simple Lie group with Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}$. The quantum moduli algebra of $(\Sigma,G)$ is a quantization of the ring of functions
of $X_G(\Sigma)$, the variety of $G$-characters of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$. It can be realized as the invariant
subalgebra of so-called graph algebras, which are $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module-algebras associated
to graphs on $\Sigma$, where $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is the quantum group corresponding to $G$. We
study the structure of the quantum moduli algebra in the case where $\Sigma$ is a sphere with $n+1$
open disks removed, $n\geq 1$. We provide new results that hold for arbitrary $G$ and generic $q$,
and develop the theory in the case where $q=\epsilon$, a root of unity of odd order, and $G=SL(2,\mathbb{C})$.
In such a situation we introduce a Frobenius morphism that provides a natural identification of
the center of the daisy graph algebra with a finite extension of the coordinate ring $\mathcal{O}(G^n)$.
We extend the quantum coadjoint action of De-Concini-Procesi, and show that the associated Poisson
structure on the center corresponds by the Frobenius morphism to the Fock-Rosly Poisson structure
on $\mathcal{O}(G^n)$. The set of fixed elements of the quantum coadjoint action in the center together
with an additional central element generates the center of the specialization at $q=\epsilon$
of the quantum moduli algebra, and we prove that it is a finite extension of $\mathbb{C}[X_G(\Sigma)]$
endowed with the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman Poisson structure. Finally, by using Wilson loop operators
we identify the Kauffman bracket skein algebra $K_{\zeta}(\Sigma)$ at $\zeta:=i\epsilon^{1/2}$
with this quantum moduli algebra specialized at $q=\epsilon$. This allows us to recast in the quantum
moduli setup some recent results of Bonahon-Wong and Frohman-Kania-Bartoszynska-L\^e on $K_{\zeta}(\Sigma)$.
