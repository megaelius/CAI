In this paper we use the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson model to obtain a linear coupled pseudoforce system
from which the wave function and the electrostatic potential of the free electron gas plasmon is
deduced. It is shown that unlike for single particle wave function the plasmon wave function and
corresponding electrostatic potential are characterized with two different wave numbers associated
with two distinct characteristic length scales, namely, that of the single electron oscillation
and of the collective Langmuir excitations. Interaction of plasmon with a rectangular potential
step/well indicates features common with that of the ordinary single quantum particle. However,
the two-tone oscillation character of the wave function and potential appear on the transmitted
amplitude over the potential barrier/well. The plasmon propagation is found to have a distinct
energy gap corresponding to the plasmon energy value of $\epsilon_g=\mu_0+2\epsilon_p$ below
which no plasmon excitations occur. For instance, the zero-point plasmon excitation energy for
Aluminium, is around $\epsilon_0\simeq 41.7$eV at room temperature, with the Fermi energy of $\epsilon_F\simeq
11.7$eV and plasmon energy of $\epsilon_p\simeq 15$eV. It is seen that for plasmon energies very
close to the energy gap, i.e. where the two characteristic scales match ($k_1\simeq k_2$), the quantum
beating effect takes place. The study of plasmon tunneling through the potential barrier indicates
that the transmittivity has oscillatory behavior similar to that of a quantum particle tunneling
through the potentials, but, with a characteristic two-tone oscillatory profiles. Current development
can have a broad range of applications in plasmon transport through diverse free electron environments
with arbitrary degeneracy and electron temperature. It also makes progress in rapidly growing
nanotechnology and plasmonic fields.
