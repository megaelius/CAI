We consider a system of $N$ servers inter-connected by some underlying graph topology $G_N$. Tasks
arrive at the various servers as independent Poisson processes of rate $\lambda$. Each incoming
task is irrevocably assigned to whichever server has the smallest number of tasks among the one where
it appears and its neighbors in $G_N$. Tasks have unit-mean exponential service times and leave
the system upon service completion. The above model has been extensively investigated in the case
$G_N$ is a clique. Since the servers are exchangeable in that case, the queue length process is quite
tractable, and it has been proved that for any $\lambda < 1$, the fraction of servers with two or more
tasks vanishes in the limit as $N \to \infty$. For an arbitrary graph $G_N$, the lack of exchangeability
severely complicates the analysis, and the queue length process tends to be worse than for a clique.
Accordingly, a graph $G_N$ is said to be $N$-optimal or $\sqrt{N}$-optimal when the occupancy process
on $G_N$ is equivalent to that on a clique on an $N$-scale or $\sqrt{N}$-scale, respectively. We
prove that if $G_N$ is an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with average degree $d(N)$, then it is with
high probability $N$-optimal and $\sqrt{N}$-optimal if $d(N) \to \infty$ and $d(N) / (\sqrt{N}
\log(N)) \to \infty$ as $N \to \infty$, respectively. This demonstrates that optimality can be
maintained at $N$-scale and $\sqrt{N}$-scale while reducing the number of connections by nearly
a factor $N$ and $\sqrt{N} / \log(N)$ compared to a clique, provided the topology is suitably random.
It is further shown that if $G_N$ contains $\Theta(N)$ bounded-degree nodes, then it cannot be $N$-optimal.
In addition, we establish that an arbitrary graph $G_N$ is $N$-optimal when its minimum degree is
$N - o(N)$, and may not be $N$-optimal even when its minimum degree is $c N + o(N)$ for any $0 < c < 1/2$.
