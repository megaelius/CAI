A fundamental problem in the representation theory of real reductive groups is to compute (and to
classify in some comprehensible way) the \emph{irreducible unitary} representations of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$.
There are three well-known procedures for constructing new representations from old: parabolic
induction, cohomological induction, and complementary series. Empirical evidence suggests
that every irreducible unitary representation can be constructed through these three procedures
from a small set of building blocks, the so-called unipotent representations. These representations
--- their structure, properties, and parameters --- remain highly mysterious. In \cite{Vogan1991},
Vogan proposes a conjectural formula for the $K$-multiplicities of unipotent representations.
He conjectures that a unipotent representation looks (roughly) like regular functions on a nilpotent
orbit. More precisely, he conjectures that if $X$ is a unipotent representation of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$
which is supported on a single nilpotent orbit $\mathcal{O} = K \cdot \chi$ satisfying $$\mathrm{codim}(\partial
\mathcal{O},\overline{\mathcal{O}}) \geq 2$$ then $X$ has the same $K$-multiplicities as an
induced representation of the form $\mathrm{Ind}^K_{K^{\chi}}V$ where $V$ is a finite-dimensional
representation of a very special type. Using ideas of Losev, we will prove Vogan's conjecture for
$G_{\mathbb{R}}$ complex and $\mathrm{codim}(\partial \mathcal{O},\overline{\mathcal{O}})
\geq 3$. Our proof relies on the existence of a very special endofunctor $\Phi_{\mathcal{O}}$ of
the category of Harish-Chandra modules which was originally constructed by Losev (\cite{losev2011}),
in a slightly different context. $\Phi_{\mathcal{O}}$ is a localization functor (in the sense
of category theory). In future work, we will apply the same techniques to various real $G_{\mathbb{R}}$.
