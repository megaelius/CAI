In these two companion papers, we give infinite families of partition identities which generalise
Primc's and Capparelli's identities, and study their consequences on the theory of crystal bases
of the affine Lie algebra $A_{n-1}^{(1)}.$ In this first paper, we focus on combinatorial aspects.
We give a $n^2$-coloured generalisation of Primc's identity by constructing a $n^2 \times n^2$
matrix of difference conditions, Primc's original identities corresponding to $n=2$ and $n=3$.
While most coloured partition identities in the literature connect partitions with difference
conditions with partitions with congruence conditions, in our case, the natural way to generalise
these identities is to relate partitions with difference conditions with coloured Frobenius partitions.
This gives a very simple expression for the generating function. With a particular specialisation
of the colour variables, our generalisation also yields a partition identity with congruence conditions.
Then, using a bijection from our new generalisation of Primc's identity, we deduce two families
of identities on $(n^2-1)$-coloured partitions which generalise Capparelli's identity, also
in terms of coloured Frobenius partitions. The particular case $n=2$ is Capparelli's identity
and the case $n=3$ recovers another identity of Primc. In the second paper, we will focus on crystal
theoretic aspects. We will show that the difference conditions we defined in our $n^2$-coloured
generalisation of Primc's identity are actually energy functions for certain $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$
crystals, and use this to derive a non-specialised character formula with positive coefficients
for all the irreducible highest weight $U_q(A_{n-1}^{(1)})$-modules of level $1$.
