A timelike space is a Hausdorff topological space equipped with a partial order relation $<$ and
a distance function $\rho$ satisfying a collection of axioms including a set of compatibility conditions
between the partial order relation and the distance function. The distance function is defined
only on a subset of the product of the space with itself that contains the diagonal, namely, $\rho(x,y)$
is defined if and only if $x<y$ or $x=y$. Distances between pairs of distinct points in a triple $x,y,z$,
whenever these distances are defined, satisfy the so-called \emph{time inequality}, which is
a reverse triangle inequality $\rho(x,y)+\rho(y,z)\leq \rho(z,y)$. In the 1960s, Herbert Busemann
developed an axiomatic theory of timelike spaces and of locally timelike spaces. His motivation
comes from the geometry underlying the theory of relativity, and he tried to adapt to this setting
his geometric theory of metric spaces, namely, his theory of $G$-spaces (geodesic spaces). The
classical example he considers is the $n$-dimensional Lorentzian space. Two other interesting
classes of examples of timelike spaces he introduced are the timelike analogues of the Funk and Hilbert
geometries. In this paper, we investigate these two geometries, and in doing this, we introduce
variants of them, in particular the timelike relative Funk and Hilbert geometries, in the Euclidean
and spherical settings. We describe the Finsler infinitesimal structure of each of these geometries
(with an appropriate notion of Finsler structure) and we display the interactions among the Euclidean
and timelike spherical geometries. In particular, we characterize the de Sitter geometry as a special
case of a timelike spherical Hilbert geometry. The final version of this paper will appear in Differential
Geometry and its Applications.
