For $d \geq 3$ we obtain an approximation of the zero-average Gaussian free field on the discrete
$d$-dimensional torus of large side length $N$ by the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$, valid
in boxes of roughly side length $N - N^\delta$ with $\delta \in (\frac12,1)$. As an implication,
the level sets of the zero-average Gaussian free field on the torus can be approximated by the level
sets of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$. This leads to a series of applications related to
level-set percolation. We show that level sets of the zero-average Gaussian free field on the torus
for levels $h > h_\star$ (where $h_\star$ denotes the critical value for level-set percolation
of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$) with high probability contain no connected component
of volume comparable to the total volume of the torus. Moreover, level sets with $h < h_\star$ with
high probability contain a connected component of (extrinsic) diameter comparable to the torus
diameter $N$. We also show that level sets of the zero-average Gaussian free field on the torus for
levels $h$ above a second critical parameter $h_{\star\star}(\geq h_\star)$, again defined via
the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$, with high probability only contain connected components
negligible in their size when compared to the size of the torus. Similar results have been obtained
by A. Teixeira and D. Windisch in [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 64(12):1599-1646, 2011] and J. \v{C}ern\'y
and A. Teixeira in [Ann. Appl. Probab., 26(5):2883-2914, 2016] for the vacant set of simple random
walk on a large discrete torus with the help of random interlacements on $\mathbb Z^d$, introduced
by A.-S. Sznitman in [Ann. of Math. (2), 171(3):2039-2087, 2010].
