The commutative and homological algebra of modules over posets is developed, as closely parallel
as possible to the algebra of finitely generated modules over noetherian commutative rings, in
the direction of finite presentations, primary decompositions, and resolutions. Interpreting
this finiteness in the language of derived categories of subanalytically constructible sheaves
proves two conjectures due to Kashiwara and Schapira concerning sheaves with microsupport in a
given cone. The motivating case is persistent homology of arbitrary filtered topological spaces,
especially the case of multiple real parameters. The algebraic theory yields computationally
feasible, topologically interpretable data structures, in terms of birth and death of homology
classes, for persistent homology indexed by arbitrary posets. The exposition focuses on the nature
and ramifications of a suitable finiteness condition to replace the noetherian hypothesis. The
tameness condition introduced for this purpose captures finiteness for variation in families
of vector spaces indexed by posets in a way that is characterized equivalently by distinct topological,
algebraic, combinatorial, and homological manifestations. Tameness serves both the theoretical
and computational purposes: it guarantees finite primary decompositions, as well as various finite
presentations and resolutions all related by a syzygy theorem, and the data structures thus produced
are computable in addition to being interpretable. The tameness condition and its resulting theory
are new even in the finitely generated discrete setting, where being tame is materially weaker than
being noetherian.
