We study combinatorial connectivity for two models of random geometric complexes. These two models
- \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips complexes - are built on a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity
$n$ on a $d$-dimensional torus using balls of radius $r_n$. In the former, the $k$-simplices/faces
are formed by subsets of $(k+1)$ Poisson points such that the balls of radius $r_n$ centred at these
points have a mutual interesection and in the latter, we require only a pairwise intersection of
the balls. Given a (simplicial) complex (i.e., a collection of $k$-simplices for all $k \geq 1$),
we can connect $k$-simplices via $(k+1)$-simplices (`up-connectivity') or via $(k-1)$-simplices
(`down-connectivity). Our interest is to understand these two combinatorial notions of connectivity
for the random \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips complexes asymptically as $n \to \infty$. In particular,
we analyse in detail the threshold radius for vanishing of isolated $k$-faces for up and down connectivity
of both types of random geometric complexes. Though it is expected that the threshold radius $r_n
= \Theta((\frac{\log n}{n})^{1/d})$ in coarse scale, our results give tighter bounds on the constants
in the logarithmic scale as well as shed light on the possible second-order correction factors.
Further, they also reveal interesting differences between the phase transition in the \v{C}ech
and Vietoris-Rips cases. The analysis is interesting due to the non-monotonicity of the number
of isolated $k$-faces (as a function of the radius) and leads one to consider `monotonic' vanishing
of isolated $k$-faces. The latter coincides with the vanishing threshold mentioned above at a coarse
scale (i.e., $\log n$ scale) but differs in the $\log \log n$ scale for the \v{C}ech complex with $k
= 1$ in the up-connected case.
