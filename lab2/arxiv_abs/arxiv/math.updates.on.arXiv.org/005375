In this article we consider a cascaded taxis model for two proliferating and degrading species which
thrive on the same nutrient but orient their movement according to different schemes. In particular,
we assume the first group, the foragers, to orient their movement directly along an increasing gradient
of the food density, while the second group, the exploiters, instead track higher densities of the
forager group. Specifically, we will investigate an initial boundary-value problem for a prototypical
forager-exploiter model of the form \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\,}c@{\,}l@{\quad
}l@{\quad}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c} u_{t}&=&\Delta u-\nabla\cdot\big(u\nabla w\big)+f(u),\ &x\in\Omega,&
t>0,\\ v_{t}&=&\Delta v-\nabla\cdot\big(v\nabla u\big)+g(v),\ &x\in\Omega,& t>0,\\ w_{t}&=&\Delta
w-(u+v)w-\mu w+r(x,t),\ &x\in\Omega,& t>0, \end{array}\right. \end{align*}%} in a smoothly
bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\mu\geq 0$, $r\in\ C^1(\bar{\Omega}\times[0,\infty))\cap
L^\infty\!\left(\Omega\times(0,\infty)\right)$ is nonnegative and the functions $f,g\in
C^1\!\left([0,\infty)\right)$ are assumed to satisfy $f(0)\geq0$, $g(0)\geq0$ as well as $$-k_f
s^{\alpha} -l_f\leq f(s)\leq -K_f s^\alpha+L_f\ \text{ and }\ -k_g s^\beta -l_g\leq g(s)\leq
-K_g s^\beta+L_g\quad\text{for }s\geq0,$$ respectively, with constants $\alpha,\beta>1$,
$k_f,K_f,k_g,K_g>0$ and $l_f,L_f,l_g,L_g\geq0$ and $\alpha,\beta>1$. Assuming that $\alpha>1+\sqrt{2}$,
$\min\{\alpha,\beta\}>\frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha-1}$ and that $r$ satisfies certain structural
conditions we establish the global solvability of this system with respect to a suitable generalized
solution concept and then, for the more restrictive case of $\alpha,\beta>1+\sqrt{2}$ and $\mu>0$,
investigate an eventual regularity effect driven by the decay of the nutrient density $w$.
