In the present work the classical problem of the kinetic theory of gases (the Smoluchowsky' problem
about temperature jump in rarefied gas) is considered. The rarefied gas fills half-space over a
flat firm surface. logarithmic gradient of temperature is set far from surface. The kinetic equation
with modelling integral of collisions in the form of BGK-model (Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook) is used.
The general mirror-diffuse boundary conditions of molecules reflexions of gas from a wall on border
of half-space (Maxwell conditions) are considered. Expanding distribution function on two orthogonal
directions in space of velocities, the Smoluchowsky' problem to the solution of the homogeneous
vector one-dimensional and one-velocity kinetic equation with a matrix kernel is reduced. Then
generalization of source-method is used and boundary conditions include in non-homogeneous vector
kinetic equation. The solution in the form of Fourier integral is searched. The problem is reduced
to the solution of vector Fredholm integral equation of the second sort with matrix kernel. The solution
of Fredholm equation in the form of Neumann's polynoms with vector coefficients is searched. The
system vector algebraic interengaged equations turns out. The solution of this system is under
construction in the form of Neumann's polynoms. Comparison with well-known Barichello - Siewert'
high-exact results is made. Zero and the first approach of jumps of temperature and numerical density
are received. It is shown, that transition from the zero to the first approach raises 10 times accuracy
in calculation coefficients of temperature and concentration jump.
