Driven by the recent advancement in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, this paper proposes
a new wireless network architecture of \emph{coordinate multipoint (CoMP) in the sky} to harness
both the benefits of interference mitigation via CoMP and high mobility of UAVs. Specifically,
we consider uplink communications in a multi-UAV enabled multi-user system, where each UAV forwards
its received signals from all ground users to a central processor (CP) for joint decoding. Moreover,
we consider the case where the users may move on the ground, thus the UAVs need to adjust their locations
in accordance with the user locations over time to maximize the network throughput. Utilizing random
matrix theory, we first characterize in closed-form a set of approximated upper and lower bounds
of the user's achievable rate in each time episode under a realistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel
model with random phase, which are shown very tight both analytically and numerically. UAV placement
and movement over different episodes are then optimized based on the derived bounds to maximize
the minimum of user average achievable rates over all episodes for both cases of full information
(of current and future episodes) and current information on the user's movement. Interestingly,
it is shown that the optimized location of each UAV at any particular episode is the weighted average
of the ground user locations at the current episode as well as its own location at the previous and/or
next episode. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate and compare the performance
of the proposed UAV placement and movement designs under different practical application scenarios.
