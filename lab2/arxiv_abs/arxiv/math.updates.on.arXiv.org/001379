We use Kovacic's algorithm to obtain all Liouvillian solutions, i.e., essentially all solutions
in terms of quadratures, of the master equation which governs the evolution of first order perturbations
of the Schwarzschild geometry. We show that all solutions in quadratures of this equation contain
a polynomial solution to an associated ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE, apart from
a few trivial cases, falls into the confluent Heun class. In the case of the gravitational perturbations,
for the Liouvillian solution $\chi \int \frac {{\rm d}r_{\!\ast}}{\chi^{2}}$, we find in "closed
form" the polynomial solution P to the associated confluent Heun ODE. We prove that the Liouvillian
solution $\chi \int \frac {{\rm d}r_{\!\ast}}{\chi^{2}}$ is a product of elementary functions,
one of them being the polynomial P. We extend previous results by Hautot and use the extended results
we derive in order to prove that P admits a finite expansion in terms of truncated confluent hypergeometric
functions of the first kind. We also prove, by using the extended results we derive, that P admits
also a finite expansion in terms of associated Laguerre polynomials. We prove, save for two unresolved
cases, that the Liouvillian solutions $\chi$ and $\chi \int \frac {{\rm d}r_{\!\ast}}{\chi^{2}}$,
initially found by Chandrasekhar, are the only Liouvillian solutions to the master equation. We
improve previous results in the literature on this problem and compare our results with theirs.
Comments are made for a more efficient implementation of Kovacic's algorithm to any second order
ODE with rational function coefficients. Our results set the stage for deriving similar results
in other black hole geometries 4-dim and higher.
