Models of static wormholes within the $f(\textit{R}, \textit{T})$ extended theory of gravity
are investigated and, in particular, the family $f(\textit{R}, \textit{T}) = R + \lambda T$, with
$T = \rho + P_{r} + 2P_{l}$ being the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Models corresponding to
different relations for the pressure components (radial and lateral), and several equations of
state (EoS), reflecting different matter content, are worked out explicitly. The solutions obtained
for the shape functions of the generated wormholes obey the necessary metric conditions, as manifested
in other studies in the literature. The respective energy conditions reveal the physical nature
of the wormhole models thus constructed. It is found, in particular, that for each of those considered,
the parameter space can be divided into different regions, in which the exact wormhole solutions
fulfill the null~(NEC) and the weak energy conditions~(WEC), respectively, in terms of the lateral
pressure. Moreover, the dominant energy condition~(DEC) in terms of both pressures is also valid,
while $\rho + P_{r} + 2P_{l} = 0$. A similar solution for the theory $P_{r} = \omega_{1} \rho + \omega_{2}
\rho^{2}$ is found numerically, where $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ are either constant or functions
of $r$, leading to the result that the NEC in terms of the radial pressure is also valid. For non-constant
$\omega_{i}$ models, attention is focused on the behavior $\omega_{i} \propto r^{m}$. To finish,
the question is addressed, how $f(R) = R+\alpha R^{2}$ will affect the wormhole solutions corresponding
to fluids of the form $P_{r} = \omega_{1} \rho + \omega_{2} \rho^{2}$, in the three cases mentioned
above. Issues concerning the nonconservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor, the stability
of the solutions obtained, and the observational possibilities for testing these models are discussed
in the last section.
