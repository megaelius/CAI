Elliptic PDE-constrained optimal control problems with $L^1$-control cost ($L^1$-EOCP) are
considered. To solve $L^1$-EOCP, the primal-dual active set (PDAS) method, which is a special semismooth
Newton (SSN) method, used to be a priority. However, in general solving Newton equations is expensive.
Motivated by the success of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we consider extending
the ADMM to $L^1$-EOCP. To discretize $L^1$-EOCP, the piecewise linear finite element (FE) is considered.
However, different from the finite dimensional $l^1$-norm, the discretized $L^1$-norm does not
have a decoupled form. To overcome this difficulty, an effective approach is utilizing nodal quadrature
formulas to approximately discretize the $L^1$-norm and $L^2$-norm. It is proved that these approximation
steps will not change the order of error estimates. To solve the discretized problem, an inexact
heterogeneous ADMM (ihADMM) is proposed. Different from the classical ADMM, the ihADMM adopts
two different weighted inner product to define the augmented Lagrangian function in two subproblems,
respectively. Benefiting from such different weighted techniques, two subproblems of ihADMM
can be efficiently implemented. Furthermore, theoretical results on the global convergence as
well as the iteration complexity results $o(1/k)$ for ihADMM are given. In order to obtain more accurate
solution, a two-phase strategy is also presented, in which the primal-dual active set (PDAS) method
is used as a postprocessor of the ihADMM. Numerical results not only confirm error estimates, but
also show that the ihADMM and the two-phase strategy are highly efficient.
