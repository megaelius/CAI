A two-dimensional simplicial complex is called $d$-{\em regular} if every edge of it is contained
in exactly $d$ distinct triangles. It is called $\epsilon$-expanding if its up-down two-dimensional
random walk has a normalized maximal eigenvalue which is at most $1-\epsilon$. In this work, we present
a class of bounded degree 2-dimensional expanders, which is the result of a small 2-complex action
on a vertex set. The resulted complexes are fully transitive, meaning the automorphism group acts
transitively on their faces. Such two-dimensional expanders are rare! Known constructions of
such bounded degree two-dimensional expander families are obtained from deep algebraic reasonings
(e.g. coset geometries). We show that given a small $d$-regular two-dimensional $\epsilon$-expander,
there exists an $\epsilon'=\epsilon'(\epsilon)$ and a family of bounded degree two-dimensional
simplicial complexes with a number of vertices goes to infinity, such that each complex in the family
satisfies the following properties: * It is $4d$-regular. * The link of each vertex in the complex
is the same regular graph (up to isomorphism). * It is $\epsilon'$ expanding. * It is transitive.
The family of expanders that we get is explicit if the one-skeleton of the small complex is a complete
multipartite graph, and it is random in the case of (almost) general $d$-regular complex. For the
randomized construction, we use results on expanding generators in a product of simple Lie groups.
This construction is inspired by ideas that occur in the zig-zag product for graphs. It can be seen
as a loose two-dimensional analog of the replacement product.
