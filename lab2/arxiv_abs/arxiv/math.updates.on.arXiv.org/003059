Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet many issues still exist
related to the analysis and prediction of these systems. Koopman theory circumvents these issues
by transforming the finite-dimensional nonlinear dynamics to a linear dynamical system of functions
in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of observables. The eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator
evolve linearly in time and thus provide a natural coordinate system for simplifying the dynamical
behaviors of the system. We consider a family of observable functions constructed by projecting
the delay coordinates of the system onto the eigenvectors of the autocorrelation function, which
can be regarded as continuous SVD basis vectors for time-delay observables. We observe that these
functions are the most parsimonious basis of observables for a system with Koopman mode decomposition
of order $N$, in the sense that the associated Koopman eigenfunctions are guaranteed to lie in the
span of the first $N$ of these coordinates. We conjecture and prove a number of theoretical results
related to the quality of these approximations in the more general setting where the system has mixed
spectra or the coordinates are otherwise insufficient to capture the full spectral information.
We prove a related and very general result that the dynamics of the observables generated by projecting
delay coordinates onto an arbitrary orthonormal basis are system-independent and depend only
on the choice of basis, which gives a highly efficient way of computing representations of the Koopman
operator in these coordinates. We show that this formalism provides a theoretical underpinning
for the empirical results in, which found that chaotic dynamical systems can be approximately factored
into intermittently forced linear systems when viewed in delay coordinates.
