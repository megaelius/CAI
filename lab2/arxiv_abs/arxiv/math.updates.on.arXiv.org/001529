Given $I\subset\mathbb{C}$ and an integer $N>0$, a function $f:I\to\mathbb{C}$ is entrywise
positivity preserving on positive semidefinite (p.s.d.) matrices $A=(a_{jk})\in I^{N\times
N}$, if the entrywise application $f[A]=(f(a_{jk}))$ of $f$ to $A$ is p.s.d. for all such $A$. Such
preservers in all dimensions have been classified by Schoenberg and Rudin as being absolutely monotonic
[Duke Math. J. 1942, 1959]. In fixed dimension $N$, results akin to work of Horn and Loewner [Trans.
AMS 1969] show the first $N$ nonzero Maclaurin coefficients of a positivity preserver $f$ are positive;
and the last $N$ coefficients are also positive if $I$ is unbounded. However, little was known about
the other coefficients: the only examples to date for unbounded domains $I$ were absolutely monotonic,
so work in all dimensions; and for bounded $I$ examples of non-absolutely monotonic preservers
were very few (and recent). In this paper, we completely characterize the sign patterns of the Maclaurin
coefficients of positivity preservers in fixed dimension $N$, over bounded and unbounded domains
$I$. In particular, the above Horn-type conditions cannot be improved upon. This also yields the
first polynomials which preserve positivity on p.s.d. matrices in $I^{N\times N}$ but not in $I^{(N+1)\times
(N+1)}$. We obtain analogous results for real exponents using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber
formula. We then go from qualitative bounds, which suffice to understand all possible sign patterns,
to exact quantitative bounds. As an application, we extend our previous qualitative and quantitative
results to understand preservers of total non-negativity in fixed dimension - including their
sign patterns. We deduce several further applications, including extending a Schur polynomial
conjecture by Cuttler-Greene-Skandera to obtain a novel characterization of weak majorization
for real tuples.
