We present the SIBIA (Scalable Integrated Biophysics-based Image Analysis) framework for joint
image registration and biophysical inversion and we apply it to analyse MR images of glioblastomas
(primary brain tumors). In particular, we consider the following problem. Given the segmentation
of a normal brain MRI and the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we wish to determine tumor growth
parameters and a registration map so that if we "grow a tumor" (using our tumor model) in the normal
segmented image and then register it to the patient segmented image, then the registration mismatch
is as small as possible. We call this "the coupled problem" because it two-way couples the biophysical
inversion and registration problems. In the image registration step we solve a large-deformation
diffeomorphic registration problem parameterized by an Eulerian velocity field. In the biophysical
inversion step we estimate parameters in a reaction-diffusion tumor growth model that is formulated
as a partial differential equation. In this paper, our contributions are the introduction of a PDE-constrained
optimization formulation of the coupled problem, the derivation of the optimality conditions,
and the derivation of a Picard iterative scheme for the solution of the coupled problem. In addition,
we perform several tests to experimentally assess the performance of our method on synthetic and
clinical datasets. We demonstrate the convergence of the SIBIA optimization solver in different
usage scenarios. We demonstrate that we can accurately solve the coupled problem in three dimensions
($256^3$ resolution) in a few minutes using 11 dual-x86 nodes. Also, we demonstrate that, with our
coupled approach, we can successfully register normal MRI to tumor-bearing MRI while obtaining
Dice coefficients that match those achieved when registering of normal-to-normal MRI.
