Hybrid analog-digital architectures are promising candidates for implementing millimeter wave
(mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems since they enable a considerable
reduction of the required number of costly radio frequency (RF) chains by moving some of the signal
processing operations into the analog domain. Nevertheless, the analog feed network, comprising
RF dividers, combiners, phase shifters, and line connections, of hybrid MIMO architectures is
not scalable due to its prohibitively high power consumption for large numbers of transmit antennas.
In this paper, we study novel massive MIMO architectures, namely reflect-array (RA) and transmit-array
(TA) antennas, which consist of few active antennas (i.e., RF chains) and large numbers of passive
antennas. We show that the constraints that the precoders for RA and TA antennas have to meet, differ
from those of conventional MIMO architectures. Taking these constraints into account and exploiting
the sparsity of mmWave channels, we design two efficient precoders for RA and TA antennas; one based
on maximizing the mutual information and one based on approximating the optimal unconstrained
digital precoder via the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Furthermore, in order to fairly
compare the performance of RA and TA antennas against conventional fully-digital and hybrid MIMO
architectures, we develop a unified power consumption model. Our simulation results show that
unlike conventional MIMO architectures, RA and TA antennas are highly energy efficient and fully
scalable in terms of the number of transmit antennas. Therefore, RA and TA antennas are candidates
for realizing the potential of \textit{massive} MIMO in practice.
