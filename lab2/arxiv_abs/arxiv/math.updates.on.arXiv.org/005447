We study the problem of crescent configurations, posed by Erd\H{o}s in 1989. A crescent configuration
is a set of $n$ points in the plane such that: 1) no three points lie on a common line, 2) no four points
lie on a common circle, 3) for each $1 \leq i \leq n - 1$, there exists a distance which occurs exactly
$i$ times. Constructions of sizes $n \leq 8$ have been provided by Liu, Pal\'{a}sti, and Pomerance.
Erd\H{o}s conjectured that there exists some $N$ for which there do not exist crescent configurations
of size $n$ for all $n \geq N$. We extend the problem of crescent configurations to general normed
spaces $(\mathbb{R}^2, \| \cdot \|)$ by studying strong crescent configurations in $\| \cdot \|$.
In an arbitrary norm $\|\cdot \|$, we construct a strong crescent configuration of size 4. We also
construct larger strong crescent configurations in the Euclidean, taxicab, and Chebyshev norms,
of sizes $n \leq 6$, $n \leq 8$, and $n \leq 8$ respectively. When defining strong crescent configurations,
we introduce the notion of line-like configurations in $\|\cdot \|$. A line-like configuration
in $\|\cdot \|$ is a set of points whose distance graph is isomorphic to the distance graph of equally
spaced points on a line. In a broad class of norms, we construct line-like configurations of arbitrary
size. Our main result is a crescent-type result about line-like configurations in the Chebyshev
norm. A line-like crescent configuration is a line-like configuration for which no three points
lie on a common line and no four points lie on a common $\|\cdot \|$ circle. We prove that for $n \geq
7$, every line-like crescent configuration of size $n$ in the Chebyshev norm must have a rigid structure.
Specifically, it must be a perpendicular perturbation of equally spaced points on a horizontal
or vertical line.
