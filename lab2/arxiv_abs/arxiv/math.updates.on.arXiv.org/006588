We consider the quantum multisoliton scattering problem. For BPS theories one truncates the full
field theory to the moduli space, a finite dimensional manifold of energy minimising field configurations,
and studies the quantum mechanical problem on this. Non-BPS theories -- the generic case -- have
no such obvious truncation. We define a quantum soliton scattering manifold as a configuration
space which satisfies asymptotic completeness and respects the underlying classical dynamics
of slow moving solitons. Having done this, we present a new method to construct such manifolds. In
the BPS case the dimension of the $n$-soliton moduli space $\mathcal{M}_n$ is $n$ multiplied by
the dimension of $\mathcal{M}_1$. We show that this scaling is not necessarily valid for scattering
manifolds in non-BPS theories, and argue that it is false for the Skyrme and baby-Skyrme models.
In these models, we show that a relative phase difference can generate a relative size difference
during a soliton collision. Asymptotically, these are zero and non-zero modes respectively and
this new mechanism softens the dichotomy between such modes. Using this discovery, we then show
that all previous truncations of the 2-Skyrmion configuration space are unsuitable for the quantum
scattering problem as they have the wrong dimension. This gives credence to recent numerical work
which suggests that the low-energy configuration space is 14-dimensional (rather than 12-dimensional,
as previously thought). We suggest some ways to construct a suitable manifold for the 2-Skyrmion
problem, and discuss applications of our new definition and construction for general soliton theories.
