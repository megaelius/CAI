The notion of timely status updating is investigated in the context of cloud computing. Measurements
of a time-varying process of interest are acquired by a sensor node, and uploaded to a cloud server
to undergo some required computations. These computations consume random amounts of service time
that are independent and identically distributed across different uploads. After the computations
are done, the results are delivered to a monitor, constituting an update. The goal is to keep the monitor
continuously fed with fresh updates over time, which is assessed by an age-of-information (AoI)
metric. A scheduler is employed to optimize the measurement acquisition times. Following an update,
an idle waiting period may be imposed by the scheduler before acquiring a new measurement. The scheduler
also has the capability to preempt a measurement in progress if its service time grows above a certain
cutoff time, and upload a fresher measurement in its place. Focusing on stationary deterministic
policies, in which waiting times are deterministic functions of the instantaneous AoI and the cutoff
time is fixed for all uploads, it is shown that the optimal waiting policy that minimizes the long
term average AoI has a threshold structure, in which a new measurement is uploaded following an update
only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that is a function of the service time distribution
and the cutoff time. The optimal cutoff is then found for standard and shifted exponential service
times. While it has been previously reported that waiting before updating can be beneficial for
AoI, it is shown in this work that preemption of late updates can be even more beneficial.
