This thesis provides an extension of the work of Dirk Kreimer and Alain Connes on the Hopf algebra
structure of Feynman graphs and renormalization to general graphs. Additionally, an algebraic
structure of the asymptotics of formal power series with factorial growth, which is compatible
with the Hopf algebraic structure, is introduced. The Hopf algebraic structure on graphs permits
the explicit enumeration of graphs with constraints for the allowed subgraphs. In the case of Feynman
diagrams a lattice structure, which will be introduced, exposes additional unique properties
for physical quantum field theories. The differential ring of factorially divergent power series
allows the extraction of asymptotic results of implicitly defined power series with vanishing
radius of convergence. Together both structures provide an algebraic formulation of large graphs
with constraints on the allowed subgraphs. These structures are motivated by and used to analyze
renormalized zero-dimensional quantum field theory at high orders in perturbation theory. As
a pure application of the Hopf algebra structure, an Hopf algebraic interpretation of the Legendre
transformation in quantum field theory is given. The differential ring of factorially divergent
power series will be used to solve two asymptotic counting problems from combinatorics: The asymptotic
number of connected chord diagrams and the number of simple permutations. For both asymptotic solutions,
all order asymptotic expansions are provided as generating functions in closed form. Both structures
are combined in an application to zero-dimensional quantum field theory. Various quantities are
explicitly given asymptotically in the zero-dimensional version of $\varphi^3$, $\varphi^4$,
QED, quenched QED and Yukawa theory with their all order asymptotic expansions.
