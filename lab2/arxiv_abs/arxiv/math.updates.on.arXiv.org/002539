In Computer Vision, edge detection is one of the favored approaches for feature and object detection
in images since it provides information about their objects boundaries. Other region-based approaches
use probabilistic analysis such as clustering and Markov random fields, but those methods cannot
be used to analyze edges and their interaction. In fact, only image segmentation can produce regions
based on edges, but it requires thresholding by simply separating the regions into binary in-out
information. Hence, there is currently a gap between edge-based and region-based algorithms,
since edges cannot be used to study the properties of a region and vice versa. The objective of this
paper is to present a novel spatial probability analysis that allows determining the probability
of inclusion inside a set of partial contours (strokes). To answer this objective, we developed
a new approach that uses electromagnetic convolutions and repulsion optimization to compute the
required probabilities. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a continuous space of probability
based only on the edge information, thus bridging the gap between the edge-based methods and the
region-based methods. The developed method is consistent with the fundamental properties of inclusion
probabilities and its results are validated by comparing an image with the probability-based estimation
given by our algorithm. The method can also be generalized to take into consideration the intensity
of the edges or to be used for 3D shapes. This is the first documented method that allows computing
a space of probability based on interacting edges, which opens the path to broader applications
such as image segmentation and contour completion.
