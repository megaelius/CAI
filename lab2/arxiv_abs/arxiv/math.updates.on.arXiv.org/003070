We study the generalized degrees of freedom (gDoF) of the block-fading noncoherent multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) channel with asymmetric distributions of link strengths, and a coherence
time of T symbol durations. We derive the optimal signaling structure for communication for asymmetric
MIMO, which is distinct from that for the MIMO with identically independent distributed (i.i.d.)
links. We extend the existing gDoF results for single input multiple output (SIMO) with i.i.d. links
to the asymmetric case, proving that selecting the statistically best antenna is gDoF-optimal.
Using the gDoF result for SIMO, we prove that for T=1, the gDoF is zero for MIMO channels with arbitrary
link strength distributions, extending the result for MIMO with i.i.d. links. We show that selecting
the statistically best antenna is gDoF-optimal for multiple input single output (MISO) channel.
We also derive the gDoF for the 2x2 MIMO channel with different exponents in the direct and cross links.
In this setting, we show that it is always necessary to use both the antennas to achieve the optimal
gDoF, in contrast to the results for 2x2 MIMO with i.i.d. links. We show that having weaker crosslinks,
gives gDoF gain compared to the case with i.i.d. links. For noncoherent MIMO with i.i.d. links, the
traditional method of training each transmit antenna independently is DoF optimal, whereas we
observe that for the asymmetric 2x2 MIMO, the traditional training is not gDoF-optimal. We extend
this observation to a larger MxM MIMO by demonstrating a strategy that can achieve larger gDoF than
a traditional training-based method.
