We show that any dimension $6$ nearly K\"ahler (or nearly para-K\"ahler) geometry arises as a projective
manifold equipped with a $\textrm{G}_2^{(*)}$ holonomy reduction. In the converse direction
we show that if a projective manifold is equipped with a parallel $7$-dimensional cross product
on its standard tractor bundle then the manifold is: a Riemannian nearly K\"ahler manifold, if the
cross product is definite, otherwise, if the cross product has the other algebraic type, the manifold
is in general stratified with nearly K\"ahler and nearly para-K\"ahler parts separated by a hypersurface
which canonically carries a Cartan $(2,3,5)$-distribution. This hypersurface is a projective
infinity for the pseudo-Riemannian geometry elsewhere on the manifold, and we establish how the
Cartan distribution can be understood explicitly, and also in terms of conformal geometry, as a
limit of the ambient nearly (para\nobreakdash-)K\"ahler structures. Any real-analytic $(2,3,5)$-distribution
is seen to arise as such a limit, because we can solve the geometric Dirichlet problem of building
a collar structure equipped with the required holonomy-reduced projective structure. A model
geometry for these structures is provided by the projectivization of the imaginary (split) octonions.
Our approach is to use Cartan/tractor theory to provide a curved version of this geometry, this encodes
a curved version of the algebra of imaginary (split) octonions as a flat structure over its projectivization.
The perspective is used to establish detailed results concerning the projective compactification
of nearly (para\nobreakdash-)K\"ahler manifolds, including how the almost (para\nobreakdash-)complex
structure and metric smoothly degenerate along the singular hypersurface to give the distribution
there.
