We study a binary hypothesis testing problem in which a defender must decide whether or not a test
sequence has been drawn from a given memoryless source $P_0$ whereas, an attacker strives to impede
the correct detection. With respect to previous works, the adversarial setup addressed in this
paper considers an attacker who is active under both hypotheses, namely, a fully active attacker,
as opposed to a partially active attacker who is active under one hypothesis only. In the fully active
setup, the attacker distorts sequences drawn both from $P_0$ and from an alternative memoryless
source $P_1$, up to a certain distortion level, which is possibly different under the two hypotheses,
in order to maximize the confusion in distinguishing between the two sources, i.e., to induce both
false positive and false negative errors at the detector, also referred to as the defender. We model
the defender-attacker interaction as a game and study two versions of this game, the Neyman-Pearson
game and the Bayesian game. Our main result is in the characterization of an attack strategy that
is asymptotically both dominant (i.e., optimal no matter what the defender's strategy is) and universal,
i.e., independent of $P_0$ and $P_1$. From the analysis of the equilibrium payoff, we also derive
the best achievable performance of the defender, by relaxing the requirement on the exponential
decay rate of the false positive error probability in the Neyman--Pearson setup and the tradeoff
between the error exponents in the Bayesian setup. Such analysis permits to characterize the conditions
for the distinguishability of the two sources given the distortion levels.
