In this paper, we propose an accurate numerical means built upon a spectral-Galerkin method in spatial
discretization and an enriched multi-step spectral-collocation approach in temporal direction,
for Maxwell equations in Cole-Cole dispersive media in two-dimensional setting. Our starting
point is to derive a new model involving only one unknown field from the original model with three
unknown fields: electric, magnetic fields and the induced electric polarisation (described by
a global temporal convolution of the electric field). This results in a second-order integral-differential
equation with a weakly singular integral kernel expressed by the Mittag-Lefler (ML) function.
The most interesting but challenging issue resides in how to efficiently deal with the singularity
in time induced by the ML function which is an infinite series of singular power functions with different
nature. With this in mind, we introduce a spectral-Galerkin method using Fourier-like basis functions
for spatial discretization, leading to a sequence of decoupled temporal integral-differential
equations (IDE) with the same weakly singular kernel involving the ML function as the original two-dimensional
problem. With a careful study of the regularity of IDE, we incorporate several leading singular
terms into the numerical scheme and approximate much regular part of the solution. Then we solve
to IDE by a multi-step well-conditioned collocation scheme together with mapping technique to
increase the accuracy and enhance the resolution. We show such an enriched collocation method is
convergent and accurate. % analysis of the scheme is carried out.
