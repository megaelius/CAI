Certain systems of inviscid fluid dynamics have the property that for solutions that are only slightly
better than differentiable in Eulerian variables, the corresponding Lagrangian trajectories
are analytic in time. We elucidate the mechanisms in fluid dynamics systems that give rise to this
automatic Lagrangian analyticity, as well as mechanisms in some particular fluids systems which
prevent it from occurring. We give a conceptual argument for a general fluids model which shows that
the fulfillment of a basic set of criteria results in the analyticity of the trajectory maps in time.
We then apply this to the incompressible Euler equations to prove analyticity of trajectories for
vortex patch solutions. We also use the method to prove the Lagrangian trajectories are analytic
for solutions to the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations, for initial data with moderate regularity.
We then examine the compressible Euler equations, and find that the finite speed of propagation
in the system is incompatible with the Lagrangian analyticity property. By taking advantage of
this finite speed we are able to construct smooth initial data with the property that some corresponding
Lagrangian trajectory is not analytic in time. We also study the Vlasov-Poisson system, uncovering
another mechanism that deters the analyticity of trajectories. In this instance, we find that a
key nonlocal operator does not preserve analytic dependence in time. For this system we can also
construct smooth initial data for which the corresponding solution has some non-analytic Lagrangian
trajectory. This provides a counterexample to Lagrangian analyticity for a system in which there
is an infinite speed of propagation, unlike the compressible Euler equations.
