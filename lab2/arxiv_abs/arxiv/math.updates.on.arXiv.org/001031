Digital revolution and recent advances in telecommunications technology enable to design communication
systems which operate within the regions close to the theoretical capacity limits. Ever-increasing
demand for wireless communications and emerging numerous high-capacity services, data rates
and applications mandate providers to employ more bandwidth-oriented solutions to meet the requirements.
It is clear that such rates could only be achieved by employing more bandwidth with the state-of-the-
art technology. Considering the fact that bands in the range of 275GHz-3000GHz, which are known
as Terahertz (THz) bands, are not allocated yet for specific active services around the globe, there
is an enormous potential to achieve the desired data rates. Although THz bands look promising to
achieve data rates on the order of several tens of Gbps, realization of fully operational THz communications
systems obliges to carry out a multi- disciplinary effort including statistical propagation and
channel characterizations, adaptive transceiver designs, reconfigurable platforms, advanced
signal processing algorithms and techniques along with upper layer protocols equipped with various
security and privacy levels. Therefore, in this study, several important statistical parameters
for line-of-sight (LOS) channels are measured. High resolution frequency domain measurements
are carried out at single-sweep within a span of 60GHz. Impact of antenna misalignment under LOS
conditions is also investigated. By validating exponential decay of the received power in both
time and frequency domain, path loss exponent is examined for different frequencies along with
the frequency-dependent path loss phenomenon. Furthermore, impact of humidity is also tested
under LOS scenario. Measurement results are presented along with relevant discussions and future
directions are provided as well.
