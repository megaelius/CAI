Lott-Sturm-Villani theory of curvature on geodesic spaces has been extended to discrete graph
spaces by C. L{\'e}onard by replacing W 2-Wasserstein geodesics by Schr{\"o}dinger bridges in
the definition of entropic curvature [23, 25, 24]. As a remarkable fact, as a temperature parameter
goes to zero, these Schr{\"o}dinger bridges are supported by geodesics of the space. We analyse
this property on discrete graphs to reach entropic curvature on discrete spaces. Our approach provides
lower bounds for the entropic curvature for several examples of graphs spaces: the lattice Z n endowed
with the counting measure, the discrete cube endowed with product probability measures, the circle,
the complete graph, the Bernoulli-Laplace model. As opposed to Erbar-Maas results on graphs [27,
10, 11], entropic curvature results of this paper imply new Pr{\'e}kopa-Leindler type of inequalities
on discrete spaces, and new transport-entropy inequalities related to refined concentration
properties for the graphs mentioned above. For example on the discrete hypercube {0, 1} n and for
the Bernoulli Laplace model, a new W 2 -- W 1 transport-entropy inequality is reached, that can not
be derived by usual induction argument over the dimension n. As a surprising fact, our method also
gives improvements of weak transport-entropy inequalities (see [28, 15]) associated to the so-called
convex-hull method by Talagrand [38]. It could also apply to other graphs. The paper starts with
a brief overview about known results concerning entropic curvature on discrete graphs. Then it
focuses on a particular entropic curvature property on graphs derived from C. L{\'e}onard approach
[23, 25, 24], and dealing with Schr{\"o}dinger bridges at zero temperature (see Definition 1.3).
The main curvature results are given in section 2, with their connections to new transport-entropy
inequalities. The concentration properties following from such transport-entropy inequalities
are not developed in the present paper. For that purpose, we refer to [15] by Gozlan \& al, where general
connections between entropy inequalities and concentration properties are widely investigated.
The strategy of proof, presented in section 3, uses the so called slowing-down procedure for Schr{\"o}dinger
bridges associated to jump processes on discrete spaces pushed forward by C. L{\'e}onard. General
statements , Proposition 3.11 and Lemma 3.1, are obtained by this procedure, which consists of decreasing
a temperature parameter $\gamma$ to 0. The curvature results for the different studied graphs are
all derived from Proposition 3.11 and Lemma 3.1. Our strategy also apply for many other graphs which
are not considered in this paper. The main goal of this paper is to push forward Leonard's approach
for entropic curvature on graphs with few significant results.
