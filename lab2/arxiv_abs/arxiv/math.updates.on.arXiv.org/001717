After recent work of Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel on the Kervaire invariant one problem, as well as
Adams' solution of the Hopf invariant one problem, an immediate consequence of Curtis conjecture
is that the set of spherical classes in $H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite. Similarly, Eccles conjecture, when
specialised to $X=S^n$ with $n>0$, together with Adams' Hopf invariant one theorem, implies that
the set of spherical classes in $H_*QS^n$ is finite. We prove a filtered version of the above the finiteness
properties. We show that if $X$ is an arbitrary $CW$-complex such that $H_*X$ is finite dimensional
then the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}\Omega^l\Sigma^{l+2}X\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^2X\to
H_*Q\Sigma^2X$ is finite; the finiteness remains valid if we formally replace $X$ with $S^{-1}$.
As an immediate and interesting application, we observe that for any compact Lie group $G$ with $\dim\mathfrak{g}>1$
and for any $n>0$ the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{[n]}\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to
{_2\pi_*}Q_0S^0\to H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite where $\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to S^0$ is a
suitably twisted transfer map. Next, we consider work of Koschorke and Sanderson which using Thom-Pontrjagin
construction provides a $1$-$1$ correspondence (a group isomorphism if $m+d>0$) $\Phi^{N,\xi}_{m,d}:
\mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times N) \longrightarrow [N_+,\Omega^{m+d}\Sigma^dT(\xi)]$.
We apply work of Asadi and Eccles on computing Stiefel-Whitney numbers of immersions to show that
given a framed immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ and choosing $n$ very large with respect to $d$
and $k$, all self-intersection manifolds of an arbitrary element of $\mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times
N)$ are boundary.
