The geometrically rigorous nonlinear analysis of elastic shells is considered in the context of
finite, but small, strain theory. The research is focused on the introduction of the full shell metric
and examination of its influence on the nonlinear structural response. The exact relation between
the reference and equidistant strains is employed and the complete analytic elastic constitutive
relation between energetically conjugated forces and strains is derived via the reciprocal shift
tensor. Utilizing these strict relations, the geometric stiffness matrix is derived explicitly
by the variation of the unknown metric. Moreover, a compact form of this matrix is presented. Despite
the linear displacement distribution due to the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis, a nonlinear strain
distribution arises along the shell thickness. This fact is sometimes disregarded for the nonlinear
analysis of thin shells based on the initial geometry, thereby ignoring the strong curviness of
a shell at some subsequent configuration. We show that the curviness of a shell at each configuration
determines the appropriate shell formulation. For shells that become strongly curved at some configurations
during deformation, the nonlinear distribution of strain throughout the thickness must be considered
in order to obtain accurate results. We investigate four computational models: one based on the
full analytical constitutive relation, and three simplified ones. Robustness, efficiency and
accuracy of the presented formulation are examined via selected numerical experiments. Our main
finding is that the employment of the full metric is often required when the complete response of
the shells is sought, even for the initially thin shells. Finally, the simplified model that provided
the best balance between efficiency and accuracy is suggested for the nonlinear analysis of strongly
curved shells.
