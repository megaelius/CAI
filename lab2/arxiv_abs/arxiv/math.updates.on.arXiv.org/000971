Reconstructing evolutionary trees from molecular sequence data is a fundamental problem in computational
biology. Stochastic models of sequence evolution are closely related to spin systems that have
been extensively studied in statistical physics and that connection has led to important insights
on the theoretical properties of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms as well as the development
of new inference methods. Here, we study maximum likelihood, a classical statistical technique
which is perhaps the most widely used in phylogenetic practice because of its superior empirical
accuracy. At the theoretical level, except for its consistency, that is, the guarantee of eventual
correct reconstruction as the size of the input data grows, much remains to be understood about the
statistical properties of maximum likelihood in this context. In particular, the best bounds on
the sample complexity or sequence-length requirement of maximum likelihood, that is, the amount
of data required for correct reconstruction, are exponential in the number, $n$, of tips---far
from known lower bounds based on information-theoretic arguments. Here we close the gap by proving
a new upper bound on the sequence-length requirement of maximum likelihood that matches up to constants
the known lower bound for some standard models of evolution. More specifically, for the $r$-state
symmetric model of sequence evolution on a binary phylogeny with bounded edge lengths, we show that
the sequence-length requirement behaves logarithmically in $n$ when the expected amount of mutation
per edge is below what is known as the Kesten-Stigum threshold. In general, the sequence-length
requirement is polynomial in $n$. Our results imply moreover that the maximum likelihood estimator
can be computed efficiently on randomly generated data provided sequences are as above.
