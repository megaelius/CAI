This paper is concerned with the problem of top-$K$ ranking from pairwise comparisons. Given a collection
of $n$ items and a few pairwise binary comparisons across them, one wishes to identify the set of $K$
items that receive the highest ranks. To tackle this problem, we adopt the logistic parametric model---the
Bradley-Terry-Luce model, where each item is assigned a latent preference score, and where the
outcome of each pairwise comparison depends solely on the relative scores of the two items involved.
Recent works have made significant progress towards characterizing the performance (e.g. the
mean square error for estimating the scores) of several classical methods, including the spectral
method and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, where they stand regarding top-$K$
ranking remains unsettled. We demonstrate that under a random sampling model, the spectral method
alone, or the regularized MLE alone, is minimax optimal in terms of the sample complexity---the
number of paired comparisons needed to ensure exact top-$K$ identification. This is accomplished
via optimal control of the entrywise error of the score estimates. We complement our theoretical
studies by numerical experiments, confirming that both methods yield low entrywise errors for
estimating the underlying scores. Our theory is established based on a novel leave-one-out trick,
which proves effective for analyzing both iterative and non-iterative optimization procedures.
Along the way, we derive an elementary eigenvector perturbation bound for probability transition
matrices, which parallels the Davis-Kahan $\sin\Theta$ theorem for symmetric matrices.
