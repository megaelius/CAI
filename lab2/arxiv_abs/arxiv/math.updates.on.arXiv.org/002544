The method of regularized stokeslets is a powerful numerical method to solve the Stokes flow equations
for problems in biological fluid mechanics. A recent variation of this method incorporates a nearest-neighbor
discretization to improve accuracy and efficiency while maintaining the ease-of-implementation
of the original meshless method. This method contains three sources of numerical error, the regularization
error associated from using the regularized form of the boundary integral equations (with parameter
$\varepsilon$), and two sources of discretization error associated with the force and quadrature
discretizations (with lengthscales $h_f$ and $h_q$). A key issue to address is the quadrature error:
initial work has not fully explained observed numerical convergence phenomena. In the present
manuscript we construct sharp quadrature error bounds for the nearest-neighbor discretisation,
noting that the error for a single evaluation of the kernel depends on the smallest distance ($\delta$)
between these discretization sets. The quadrature error bounds are described for two cases: with
disjoint sets ($\delta>0$) being close to linear in $h_q$ and insensitive to $\varepsilon$, and
contained sets ($\delta=0$) being quadratic in $h_q$ with inverse dependence on $\varepsilon$.
The practical implications of these error bounds are discussed with reference to the condition
number of the matrix system for the nearest-neighbor method, with the analysis revealing that the
condition number is insensitive to $\varepsilon$ for disjoint sets, and grows linearly with $\varepsilon$
for contained sets. Error bounds for the general case ($\delta\geq 0$) are revealed to be proportional
to the sum of the errors for each case.
