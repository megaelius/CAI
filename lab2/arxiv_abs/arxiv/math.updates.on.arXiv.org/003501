Inspired by the recent successful completion of the study of the well-posedness theory for the Cauchy
problem of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation we study the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem
for a class of coupled KdV-KdV systems in the space $\mathcal{H}^s (R) := H^s (R)\times H^s (R)$.
A complete classification of the systems in terms of its well-posedness in $\mathcal{H}^s (R)$
based on the coefficients of the systems is provided: the locally analytically well-posedness
of the the system in the space $\mathcal{H}^s (R)$ belongs to one of the following four classes: (
I ) $ s\geq -\frac{13}{12}$, (II) $ s>-\frac34$, (III) $ s>0$, (IV) $s\geq \frac34 $. The key ingredients
in our proofs are the bilinear estimates in both divergence and non-divergence forms under the Fourier
restriction space norm. There are four different types of the bilinear estimates that need to be
investigated for the coupled KdV-KdV systems. Sharp bilinear estimates are established for all
of them. In contrast to the lone critical index $-\frac{3}{4}$ for the single KdV, the critical indexes
for the coupled KdV-KdV are $-\frac{13}{12}$, $-\frac{3}{4}$, $0$ and $\frac{3}{4}$ depending
on the ratio $\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ of the dispersion coefficients of the systems and the type of the
bilinear estimates. As a result, the systems are classified into four classes, each of them corresponds
to a unique index $s^{*}\in\{-\frac{13}{12},\,-\frac{3}{4},\,0,\,\frac{3}{4}\}$ such that
any system in this class is locally analytically well-posed if $s>s^{*}$ while the bilinear estimate,
the key for the proof of the well-posedness, fails if $s<s^{*}$.
