In this work, we first solve complex Morse flow equations for the simplest case of a bosonic harmonic
oscillator to discuss localization in the context of Picard-Lefschetz theory. We briefly touch
on the exact non-BPS solutions of the bosonized supersymmetric quantum mechanics on algebraic
geometric grounds and report that their complex phases can be accessed through the cohomology of
WKB 1-form of the underlying singular spectral curve subject to necessary cohomological corrections
for non-zero genus. Motivated by Picard-Lefschetz theory, we write down a general formula for the
index of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ quantum mechanics with background $R$-symmetry gauge fields. We conjecture
that certain symmetries of the refined Witten index and singularities of the moduli space may be
used to determine the correct intersection coefficients. A few examples, where this conjecture
holds, are shown in both linear and closed quivers with rank-one quiver gauge groups. The $R$-anomaly
removal along the "Morsified" relative homology cycles also called "Lefschetz thimbles" is shown
to lead to the appearance of Stokes lines. We show that the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) parameters appear
in the intersection coefficients for the relative homology of the quiver quantum mechanics resulting
from dimensional reduction of $2d$ $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauge theory on a circle and explicitly
calculate integrals along the Lefschetz thimbles in $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathbb{CP}^{k-1}$ model.
The Stokes jumping of coefficients and its relation to wall crossing phenomena is briefly discussed.
We also find that the notion of "on-the-wall" index is related to the invariant Lefschetz thimbles
under Stokes phenomena. An implication of the Lefschetz thimbles in constructing knots from quiver
quantum mechanics is indicated.
