We consider the semilinear heat equation posed on a smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$
with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. The control input is a source term localized in some
arbitrary nonempty open subset $\omega$ of $\Omega$. The goal of this paper is to prove the uniform
large time global null-controllability for semilinearities $f(s) = \pm |s| \log^{\alpha}(2+|s|)$
where $\alpha \in [3/2,2)$ which is the case left open by Enrique Fernandez-Cara and Enrique Zuazua
in 2000. It is worth mentioning that the free solution (without control) can blow-up. First, we establish
the small-time global \textit{nonnegative-controllability} (respectively \textit{nonpositive-controllability})
of the system, i.e., one can steer any initial data to a nonnegative (respectively nonpositive)
state in arbitrary time. In particular, one can act locally thanks to the control term in order to
prevent the blow-up from happening. The proof relies on precise observability estimates for the
linear heat equation with a bounded potential $a(t,x)$. More precisely, we show that observability
holds with a sharp constant of the order $\exp(C \lVert a\rVert_\infty^{1/2})$ for \textit{nonnegative}
initial data. This inequality comes from a new $L^1$ Carleman estimate. A Kakutani's fixed point
argument enables to go back to the semilinear heat equation. Secondly, the uniform large time null-controllability
result comes from three ingredients: the global nonnegative-controllability, a comparison principle
between the free solution and the solution to the underlying ordinary differential equation which
provides the convergence of the free solution toward $0$ in $L^\infty(\Omega)$norm, and the local
null-controllability of the semilinear heat equation.
