In this paper we are particularly interested in the image inpainting problem using directional
complex tight wavelet frames. Under the assumption that frame coefficients of images are sparse,
several iterative thresholding algorithms for the image inpainting problem have been proposed
in the literature. The outputs of such iterative algorithms are closely linked to solutions of several
convex minimization models using the balanced approach which simultaneously combines the $l_1$-regularization
for sparsity of frame coefficients and the $l_2$-regularization for smoothness of the solution.
Due to the redundancy of a tight frame, elements of a tight frame could be highly correlated and therefore,
their corresponding frame coefficients of an image are expected to close to each other. This is called
the grouping effect in statistics. In this paper, we establish the grouping effect property for
frame-based convex minimization models using the balanced approach. This result on grouping effect
partially explains the effectiveness of models using the balanced approach for several image restoration
problems. Inspired by recent development on directional tensor product complex tight framelets
(TP-CTFs) and their impressive performance for the image denoising problem, in this paper we propose
an iterative thresholding algorithm using a single tight frame derived from TP-CTFs for the image
inpainting problem. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can handle well both
cartoons and textures simultaneously and performs comparably and often better than several well-known
frame-based iterative thresholding algorithms for the image inpainting problem without noise.
For the image inpainting problem with additive zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise, our proposed algorithm
using TP-CTFs performs superior than other known state-of-the-art frame-based image inpainting
algorithms.
