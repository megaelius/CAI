In this paper a new method is presented for the formulation and solution of two-time, response-excitation
moment equations for a nonlinear dynamical system excited by colored, Gaussian or non-Gaussian
processes. Starting from equations for the two-time moments (e.g. for Cxy(t,s), Cxx(t,s)), the
method uses an exact time-closure condition, in addition to a Gaussian moment closure, in order
to obtain a closed, non-local in time (causal) subsystem for the one-time (t=s) moments. After solving
this causal system, the two-time moments can be calculated for all (t,s) pairs as well. The present
method differs essentially from the classical It\^o/FPK approach since it does not involve any
specific assumptions regarding the correlation structure of the excitation. In the case where
the input random process can be obtained as the solution of an It\^o equation (as, e.g., happens with
an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), the proposed non-local system is localized, leading to moment
equations identical with the usual ones. The closed, non-local in time, moment system is numerically
solved by means of an appropriate, two-scale, iterative scheme, and numerical results are presented
for two families of colored stochastic excitations. The results are confirmed by means of extensive
Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that both the correlation time and the details of the shape of
the input random function affect appreciable the response covariance. In the present paper we focus
on a monostable cubic half-oscillator, excited by a smoothly-correlated, linear-plus-cubic-Gaussian
(non-Gaussian) random input. The bistable case, as well as more general nonlinear systems can be
treated by the same method, provided that a more elaborate moment closure will be used.
