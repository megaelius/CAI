This manuscript derives an evolution equation for the symmetric part of the gradient (the strain
tensor) in the incompressible Navier Stokes equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, and proves the existence
of $L^2$ mild solutions to this equation. We use this equation to obtain a simplified identity for
the growth of enstrophy for mild solutions that depends only on the strain tensor, not on the nonlocal
interaction of the strain tensor with the vorticity. The resulting identity allows us to prove a
new family of scale-critical necessary and sufficient conditions for blow-up of the solution at
time $T_{max}<+\infty$, which depend only on the history of the positive part of the second eigenvalue
of the strain matrix. Since this matrix is trace-free, this severely restricts the geometry of any
finite-time blow-up. This regularity criterion provides analytical evidence of the numerically
observed tendency of the vorticity to align with the eigenvector corresponding to the middle eigenvalue
of the strain matrix. This regularity criterion allows us to prove as a corollary a new scale critical
one component type regularity criterion for a range of exponents for which there were previously
no known critical one component type regularity criteria. Our analysis also permits us to extend
the known time of existence of smooth solutions with initial enstrophy $E_0=\frac{1}{2}||\nabla
\otimes u^0||_{L^2}^2$ fixed by a factor of $4{,}920{.}75$--although the previous constant in
the literature was not expected to be close to optimal, so this improvement is less drastic than it
sounds, especially compared with numerical results. Finally, we will prove some properties about
blowup for a toy model ODE of the strain tensor evolution equation.
