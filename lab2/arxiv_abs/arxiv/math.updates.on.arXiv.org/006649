In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a nonlinear system of reaction-diffusion
equations that constitutes a simplified and relaxed version of a thermodynamically consistent
phase field model for tumor growth originally introduced in [12]. The model takes the effect of chemotaxis
into account but neglects velocity contributions. The unknown quantities of the governing state
equations are the chemical potential, the (normalized) tumor fraction, and the nutrient extra-cellular
water concentration. The equation governing the evolution of the tumor fraction is dominated by
the variational derivative of a double-well potential which may be of singular (e.g., logarithmic)
type. In contrast to the recent paper [9] on the same system, we consider in this paper sparsity effects,
which means that the cost functional contains a nondifferentiable (but convex) contribution like
the $L^1-$norm. For such problems, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions and
conditions for directional sparsity, both with respect to space and time, where the latter case
is of particular interest for practical medical applications in which the control variables are
given by the administration of cytotoxic drugs or by the supply of nutrients. In addition to these
results, we prove that the corresponding control-to-state operator is twice continuously differentiable
between suitable Banach spaces, using the implicit function theorem. This result, which complements
and sharpens a differentiability result derived in [9], constitutes a prerequisite for a future
derivation of second-order sufficient optimality conditions.
