Submodular function minimization (SFM) is a fundamental and efficiently solvable problem class
in combinatorial optimization with a multitude of applications in various fields. Surprisingly,
there is only very little known about constraint types under which SFM remains efficiently solvable.
The arguably most relevant non-trivial constraint class for which polynomial SFM algorithms are
known are parity constraints, i.e., optimizing only over sets of odd (or even) cardinality. Parity
constraints capture classical combinatorial optimization problems like the odd-cut problem,
and they are a key tool in a recent technique to efficiently solve integer programs with a constraint
matrix whose subdeterminants are bounded by two in absolute value. We show that efficient SFM is
possible even for a significantly larger class than parity constraints, by introducing a new approach
that combines techniques from Combinatorial Optimization, Combinatorics, and Number Theory.
In particular, we can show that efficient SFM is possible over all sets (of any given lattice) of cardinality
r mod m, as long as m is a constant prime power. This covers generalizations of the odd-cut problem
with open complexity status, and with relevance in the context of integer programming with higher
subdeterminants. To obtain our results, we establish a connection between the correctness of a
natural algorithm, and the inexistence of set systems with specific combinatorial properties.
We introduce a general technique to disprove the existence of such set systems, which allows for
obtaining extensions of our results beyond the above-mentioned setting. These extensions settle
two open questions raised by Geelen and Kapadia [Combinatorica, 2017] in the context of computing
the girth and cogirth of certain types of binary matroids.
