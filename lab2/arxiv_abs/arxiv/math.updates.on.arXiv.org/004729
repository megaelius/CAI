We study the combinatorial structure of the irreducible characters of the classical groups ${\rm
GL}_{n}(\mathbb{C})$, ${\rm SO}_{2n+1}(\mathbb{C})$, ${\rm Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$, ${\rm
SO}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ and the "non-classical" odd symplectic group ${\rm Sp}_{2n+1}(\mathbb{C})$,
finding new connections to the probabilistic model of Last Passage Percolation (LPP). Perturbing
the expressions of these characters as generating functions of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, we produce
two families of symmetric polynomials that interpolate between characters of ${\rm Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$
and ${\rm SO}_{2n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ and between characters of ${\rm SO}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ and
${\rm SO}_{2n+1}(\mathbb{C})$. We identify the first family as a one-parameter specialization
of Koornwinder polynomials, for which we thus provide a novel combinatorial structure; on the other
hand, the second family appears to be new. We next develop a method of Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern decomposition
to establish identities between all these polynomials that, in the case of characters, can be viewed
as describing the decomposition of irreducible representations of the groups when restricted
to certain subgroups. Through these formulas we connect orthogonal and symplectic characters,
and more generally the interpolating polynomials, to LPP models with various symmetries, thus
going beyond the link with classical Schur polynomials originally found by Baik and Rains [BR01a].
Taking the scaling limit of the LPP models, we finally provide an explanation of why the Tracy-Widom
GOE and GSE distributions from random matrix theory admit formulations in terms of both Fredholm
determinants and Fredholm Pfaffians.
