Computational electrodynamics (CED), the numerical solution of Maxwell's equations, plays an
incredibly important role in several problems in science and engineering. High accuracy solutions
are desired, and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is one of the better ways of delivering high
accuracy in CED. Maxwell's equations have a pair of involution constraints for which mimetic schemes
that globally satisfy the constraints at a discrete level are highly desirable. Balsara and Kappeli
presented a von Neumann stability analysis of globally constraint-preserving DG schemes for CED
up to 4'th order which was focused on developing the theory and documenting the superior dissipation
and dispersion of DGTD schemes in media with constant permittivity and permeability. In this paper
we present DGTD schemes for CED that go up to 5'th order of accuracy and analyze their performance
when permittivity and permeability vary strongly in space. Our DGTD schemes achieve constraint
preservation by collocating the electric displacement and magnetic induction as well as their
higher order modes in the faces of the mesh. Our first finding is that at 4'th and higher orders, one
has to evolve some zone-centered modes in addition to the face-centered modes. It is well-known
that the limiting step in DG schemes causes a reduction of the optimal accuracy of the scheme. In this
paper we document simulations where permittivity and permeability vary by almost an order of magnitude
without requiring any limiting of the DG scheme. This very favorable finding ensures that DGTD schemes
retain optimal accuracy even in the presence of large spatial variations in permittivity/permeability.
Our third finding shows that the electromagnetic energy is conserved very well even when permittivity
and permeability vary strongly in space; as long as the conductivity is zero.
