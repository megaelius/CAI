This paper gives a systematic study of Sobolev, Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces on a noncommutative
$d$-torus $\mathbb{T}^d_\theta$ (with $\theta$ a skew symmetric real $d\times d$-matrix). These
spaces share many properties with their classical counterparts. We prove, among other basic properties,
the lifting theorem for all these spaces and a Poincar\'e type inequality for Sobolev spaces. We
also show that the Sobolev space $W^k_\infty(\mathbb{T}^d_\theta)$ coincides with the Lipschitz
space of order $k$, already studied by Weaver in the case $k=1$. We establish the embedding inequalities
of all these spaces, including the Besov and Sobolev embedding theorems. We obtain Littlewood-Paley
type characterizations for Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in a general way, as well as the concrete
ones in terms of the Poisson, heat semigroups and differences. Some of them are new even in the commutative
case, for instance, our Poisson semigroup characterizations improve the classical ones. As a consequence
of the characterization of the Besov spaces by differences, we extend to the quantum setting the
recent results of Bourgain-Br\'ezis -Mironescu and Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova on the limits of Besov
norms. The same characterization implies that the Besov space $B^\alpha_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{T}^d_\theta)$
for $\alpha>0$ is the quantum analogue of the usual Zygmund class of order $\alpha$. We investigate
the interpolation of all these spaces, in particular, determine explicitly the K-functional of
the couple $(L_p(\mathbb{T}^d_\theta), \, W^k_p(\mathbb{T}^d_\theta))$, which is the quantum
analogue of a classical result due to Johnen and Scherer. Finally, we show that the completely bounded
Fourier multipliers on all these spaces do not depend on the matrix $\theta$, so coincide with those
on the corresponding spaces on the usual $d$-torus.
