In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio systems. In particular, a secondary network
employs an FD base station (BS) for serving multiple half-duplex downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users
simultaneously. An IRS is deployed to enhance the performance of the secondary network while helping
to mitigate the interference caused to the primary users (PUs). The DL transmit beamforming vectors
and the UL receive beamforming vectors at the FD BS, the transmit power of the UL users, and the phase
shift matrix at the IRS are jointly optimized for maximization of the total sum rate of the secondary
system. The design task is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account
the imperfect knowledge of the PUs' channel state information (CSI) and their maximum interference
tolerance. Since the maximum interference tolerance constraint is intractable, we apply a safe
approximation to transform it into a convex constraint. To efficiently handle the resulting approximated
optimization problem, which is still non-convex, we develop an iterative block coordinate descent
(BCD)-based algorithm. This algorithm exploits semidefinite relaxation, a penalty method, and
successive convex approximation and is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the approximated
optimization problem. Our simulation results do not only reveal that the proposed scheme yields
a substantially higher system sum rate for the secondary system than several baseline schemes,
but also confirm its robustness against CSI uncertainty. Besides, our results illustrate the tremendous
potential of IRS for managing the various types of interference arising in FD cognitive radio networks.
