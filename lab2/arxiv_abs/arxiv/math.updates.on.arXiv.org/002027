Zero-curvature representations (ZCRs) are one of the main tools in the theory of integrable PDEs.
In particular, Lax pairs for $(1+1)$-dimensional PDEs can be interpreted as ZCRs. For any $(1+1)$-dimensional
scalar evolution equation $E$, we define a family of Lie algebras $F(E)$ which are responsible for
all ZCRs of $E$ in the following sense. Representations of the algebras $F(E)$ classify all ZCRs
of the equation $E$ up to local gauge transformations. To achieve this, we find a normal form for ZCRs
with respect to the action of the group of local gauge transformations. Using these algebras, one
obtains some necessary conditions for integrability of the considered PDEs (where integrability
is understood in the sense of soliton theory) and necessary conditions for existence of a Backlund
transformation between two given equations. In our approach, ZCRs may depend on partial derivatives
of arbitrary order, which may be higher than the order of the equation $E$. The algebras $F(E)$ are
defined in terms of generators and relations and generalize Wahlquist-Estabrook prolongation
algebras, which are responsible for a much smaller class of ZCRs. We describe general properties
of $F(E)$ for arbitrary $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar evolution equations and study the structure
of $F(E)$ for some classes of equations of orders $3$, $5$, $7$, which include KdV, Krichever-Novikov,
Kaup-Kupershmidt, Sawada-Kotera type equations. Among the obtained algebras, one finds infinite-dimensional
Lie algebras of certain matrix-valued functions on rational and elliptic algebraic curves. Applications
to obtaining some non-existence results for Backlund transformations and proving non-integrability
for some scalar evolution equations are presented as well.
