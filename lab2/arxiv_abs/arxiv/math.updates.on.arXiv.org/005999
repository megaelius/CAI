We consider a matching market where buyers and sellers arrive according to independent Poisson
processes at the same rate and independently abandon the market if not matched after an exponential
amount of time with the same mean. In this centralized market, the utility for the system manager
from matching any buyer and any seller is a general random variable. We consider a sequence of systems
indexed by $n$ where the arrivals in the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ system are sped up by a factor of $n$. We
analyze two families of one-parameter policies: the population threshold policy immediately
matches an arriving agent to its best available mate only if the number of mates in the system is above
a threshold, and the utility threshold policy matches an arriving agent to its best available mate
only if the corresponding utility is above a threshold. Using an asymptotic fluid analysis of the
two-dimensional Markov process of buyers and sellers, we show that when the matching utility distribution
is light-tailed, % (i.e., the expected value of the maximum of many random variables is a regularly
varying function with $\alpha=0$) the population threshold policy with threshold $\frac{n}{\ln
n}$ is asymptotically optimal among all policies that make matches only at agent arrival epochs.
In the heavy-tailed case% (i.e., $\alpha\in(0,1)$), we characterize the optimal threshold level
for both policies. %although they do not attain the performance of our loose upper bound. We also
study the utility threshold policy in an unbalanced matching market with heavy-tailed matching
utilities, and find that the buyers and sellers have the same asymptotically optimal utility threshold.
