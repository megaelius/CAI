Let $G$ be a discrete countable infinite group. We show that each topological $(C,F)$-action $T$
of $G$ on a locally compact non-compact Cantor set is a free minimal amenable action admitting a unique
up to scaling non-zero invariant Radon measure (answer to a question by Kellerhals, Monod and R{\o}rdam).
We find necessary and sufficient conditions under which two such actions are topologically conjugate
in terms of the underlying $(C,F)$-parameters. If $G$ is linearly ordered Abelian then the topological
centralizer of $T$ is trivial. If $G$ is monotileable and amenable, denote by ${\cal A}_G$ the set
of all probability preserving actions of $G$ on the unit interval with Lebesgue measure and endow
it with the natural topology. We show that the set of $(C,F)$-parameters of all $(C,F)$-actions
of $G$ furnished with a suitable topology is a model for ${\cal A}_G$ in the sense of Forman, Rudolph
and Weiss. If $T$ is a rank-one transformation with bounded sequences of cuts and spacer maps then
we found simple necessary and sufficient conditions on the related $(C,F)$-parameters under which
(i) $T$ is rigid, (ii) $T$ is totally ergodic. It is found an alternative proof of Ryzhikov's theorem
that if $T$ is totally ergodic and non-rigid rank-one map with bounded parameters then $T$ has MSJ.
We also give a more general version of the criterium (by Gao and Hill) for isomorphism and disjointness
of two commensurate non-rigid totally ergodic rank-one maps with bounded parameters. It is shown
that the rank-one transformations with bounded parameters and no spacers over the last subtowers
is a proper subclass of the rank-one transformations with bounded parameters.
