In this paper, we study simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems employing
practical non-linear energy harvester (EH) circuits. Since the voltage across the reactive elements
of realistic EH circuits cannot drop or rise instantaneously, EHs have memory which we model with
a Markov decision process (MDP). Moreover, since an analytical model that accurately models all
non-linear effects and the unavoidable impedance mismatch of EHs is not tractable, we propose a
learning based model for the EH circuit. We optimize the input signal distribution for maximization
of the harvested power under a constraint on the minimum mutual information between transmitter
(TX) and information receiver (IR). We distinguish the cases where the MDP state is known and not
known at TX and IR. When the MDP state is known, the formulated optimization problem for the harvested
power is convex. In contrast, if TX and IR do not know the MDP state, the resulting optimization problem
is non-convex and solved via alternating optimization, which is shown to yield a stationary point
of the problem. Our simulation results reveal that the rate-power region of the considered SWIPT
system depends on the symbol duration, the EH input power level, the EH impedance mismatch, and the
type of EH circuit. In particular, a shorter symbol duration enables higher bit rates at the expense
of a significant decrease in the average harvested power. Furthermore, whereas half-wave rectifiers
outperform full-wave rectifiers in the low and medium input power regimes, full-wave rectifiers
are preferable if the input power at the EH is high.
