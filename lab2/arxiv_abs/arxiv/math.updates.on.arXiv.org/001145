In the early twentieth century, L.E.J. Brouwer pioneered a new philosophy of mathematics, called
intuitionism. Intuitionism was revolutionary in many respects but stands out -mathematically
speaking- for its challenge of Hilbert's formalist philosophy of mathematics and rejection of
the law of excluded middle from the 'classical' logic used in mainstream mathematics. Out of intuitionism
grew intuitionistic logic and the associated Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation by
which 'there exists x' intuitively means 'an algorithm to compute x is given'. A number of schools
of constructive mathematics were developed, inspired by Brouwer's intuitionism and invariably
based on intuitionistic logic, but with varying interpretations of what constitutes an algorithm.
This paper deals with the dichotomy between constructive and non-constructive mathematics, or
rather the absence of such an 'excluded middle'. In particular, we challenge the 'binary' view that
mathematics is either constructive or not. To this end, we identify a part of classical mathematics,
namely classical Nonstandard Analysis, and show it inhabits the twilight-zone between the constructive
and non-constructive. Intuitively, the predicate 'x is standard' typical of Nonstandard Analysis
can be interpreted as 'x is computable', giving rise to computable (and sometimes constructive)
mathematics obtained directly from classical Nonstandard Analysis. Our results formalise Osswald's
longstanding conjecture that classical Nonstandard Analysis is locally constructive. Finally,
an alternative explanation of our results is provided by Brouwer's thesis that logic depends upon
mathematics.
