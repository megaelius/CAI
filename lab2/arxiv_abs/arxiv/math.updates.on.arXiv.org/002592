Partial differential equations (PDEs) with inputs that depend on infinitely many parameters pose
serious theoretical and computational challenges. Sophisticated numerical algorithms that
automatically determine which parameters need to be activated in the approximation space in order
to estimate a quantity of interest to a prescribed error tolerance are needed. For elliptic PDEs
with parameter-dependent coefficients, stochastic Galerkin finite element methods (SGFEMs)
have been well studied. Under certain assumptions, it can be shown that there exists a sequence of
SGFEM approximation spaces for which the energy norm of the error decays to zero at a rate that is independent
of the number of input parameters. However, it is not clear how to adaptively construct these spaces
in a practical and computationally efficient way. We present a new adaptive SGFEM algorithm that
tackles elliptic PDEs with parameter-dependent coefficients quickly and efficiently. We consider
approximation spaces with a multilevel structure---where each solution mode is associated with
a finite element space on a potentially different mesh---and use an implicit a posteriori error
estimation strategy to steer the adaptive enrichment of the space. At each step, the components
of the error estimator are used to assess the potential benefits of a variety of enrichment strategies,
including whether or not to activate more parameters. No marking or tuning parameters are required.
Numerical experiments for a selection of test problems demonstrate that the new method performs
optimally in that it generates a sequence of approximations for which the estimated energy error
decays to zero at the same rate as the error for the underlying finite element method applied to the
associated parameter-free problem.
