Flux-limited Keller-Segel (FLKS) model has been recently derived from kinetic transport models
for bacterial chemotaxis and shown to represent better the collective movement observed experimentally.
Recently, associated to the kinetic model, a new instability formalism has been discovered related
to stiff chemotactic response. This motivates our study of traveling wave and aggregation in population
dynamics of chemotactic cells based on the FLKS model with a population growth term. Our study includes
both numerical and theoretical contributions. In the numerical part, we uncover a variety of solution
types in the one-dimensional FLKS model additionally to standard Fisher/KPP type traveling wave.
The remarkable result is a counter-intuitive backward traveling wave, where the population density
initially saturated in a stable state transits toward an unstable state in the local population
dynamics. Unexpectedly, we also find that the backward traveling wave solution transits to a localized
spiky solution as increasing the stiffness of chemotactic response. In the theoretical part, we
obtain a novel analytic formula for the minimum traveling speed which includes the counterbalancing
effect of chemotactic drift vs. reproduction/diffusion in the propagating front. The front propagation
speeds of numerical results only slightly deviate from the minimum traveling speeds, except for
the localized spiky solutions, even for the backward traveling waves. We also discover an analytic
solution of unimodal traveling wave in the large-stiffness limit, which is certainly unstable
but exists in a certain range of parameters.
