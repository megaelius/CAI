We develop causality theory for upper semi-continuous distributions of cones over manifolds generalizing
results from mathematical relativity in two directions: non-round cones and non-regular differentiability
assumptions. We prove the validity of most results of the regular Lorentzian causality theory including
causal ladder, Fermat's principle, notable singularity theorems in their causal formulation,
Avez-Seifert theorem, characterizations of stable causality and global hyperbolicity by means
of (smooth) time functions. For instance, we give the first proof for these structures of the equivalence
between stable causality, $K$-causality and existence of a time function. The result implies that
closed cone structures that admit continuous increasing functions also admit smooth ones. We also
study proper cone structures, the fiber bundle analog of proper cones. For them we obtain most results
on domains of dependence. Moreover, we prove that horismos and Cauchy horizons are generated by
lightlike geodesics, the latter being defined through the achronality property. Causal geodesics
and steep temporal functions are obtained with a powerful product trick. The paper also contains
a study of Lorentz-Minkowski spaces under very weak regularity conditions. Finally, we introduce
the concepts of stable distance and stable spacetime solving two well known problems (a) the characterization
of Lorentzian manifolds embeddable in Minkowski spacetime, they turn out to be the stable spacetimes,
(b) the proof that topology, order and distance (with a formula a la Connes) can be represented by
the smooth steep temporal functions. The paper is self-contained, in fact we do not use any advanced
result from mathematical relativity.
