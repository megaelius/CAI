The classical stochastic control problem under partial information can be formulated as a control
problem for Zakai equation, whose solution is the unnormalized conditional probability distribution
of the state of the system. Zakai equation is a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. Therefore, the
problem to be solved is similar to that met in Mean Field Control theory. Since Mean Field Control
theory is much posterior to the development of Stochastic Control with partial information, the
tools, techniques, and concepts obtained in the last decade, for Mean Field Games and Mean field
type Control theory, have not been used for the control of Zakai equation. Our objective is to connect
the two theories. We get the power of new tools, and we get new insights for the problem of stochastic
control with partial information. For mean field theory, we get new interesting applications,
but also new problems. Indeed, Mean Field Control Theory leads to very complex equations, like the
Master equation, which is a nonlinear infinite dimensional P.D.E., for which general theorems
are hardly available, although active research in this direction is performed. Direct methods
are useful to obtain regularity results. We will develop in detail the LQ regulator problem, but
since we cannot just consider the Gaussian case, well-known results, such as the separation principle
is not available. An important result is available in the literature, due to A. Makowsky. It describes
the solution of Zakai equation for linear systems with general initial condition (non-gaussian).
We show that the separation principle can be extended for quadratic pay-off functionals, but the
Kalman filter is much more complex than in the gaussian case. Finally we compare our work to the work
of E. Bandini et al. and we show that the example E. Bandini et al. provided does not cover ours. Our
system remains nonlinear in their setting.
