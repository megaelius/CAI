We study fundamental solutions of elliptic operators of order $2m\geq4$ with constant coefficients
in large dimensions $n\ge 2m$, where their singularities become unbounded. For compositions of
second order operators these can be chosen as convolution products of positive singular functions,
which are positive themselves. As soon as $n\geq3$, the polyharmonic operator $(-\Delta)^m$ may
no longer serve as a prototype for the general elliptic operator. It is known from examples of [V.G.
Maz'ya, S. A. Nazarov, Math. Notes 39 (1986); Transl. of Mat. Zametki 39 (1986)] and [E.B. Davies,
Journal Differ. Equations 135 (1997)] that in dimensions $n\ge 2m+3$ fundamental solutions of
specific operators of order $2m\geq4$ may change sign near their singularities: there are ``positive''
as well as ``negative'' directions along which the fundamental solution tends to $+\infty$ and
$-\infty$ respectively, when approaching its pole. In order to understand this phenomenon systematically
we first show that existence of a ``positive'' direction directly follows from the ellipticity
of the operator. We establish an inductive argument by space dimension which shows that sign change
in some dimension implies sign change in any larger dimension for suitably constructed operators.
Moreover, we deduce for $n=2m$, $n=2m+2$ and for all odd dimensions an explicit closed expression
for the fundamental solution in terms of its symbol. From such formulae it becomes clear that the
sign of the fundamental solution for such operators depends on the dimension. Indeed, we show that
we have even sign change for a suitable operator of order $2m$ in dimension $n=2m+2$. On the other
hand we show that in the dimensions $n=2m$ and $n=2m+1$ the fundamental solution of any such elliptic
operator is always positive around its singularity.
