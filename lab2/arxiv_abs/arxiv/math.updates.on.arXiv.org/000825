Due to the efforts of many mathematicians, there has been a classification of harmonic two-spheres
into compact (semi-simple) Lie groups as well as compact inner symmetric spaces. Such harmonic
maps have been shown by Uhlenbeck, Burstall-Guest, Segal to have a finite uniton number. Moreover,
the monodromy representation was shown to be trivial and to be polynomial in the loop parameter.
We will introduce a general definition according to which such maps are called to be of finite uniton
type. This paper aims to generalize results of [2] to harmonic maps of finite uniton type into a non-compact
inner symmetric space. For this purpose, we first recall some basic results about harmonic maps
of finite uniton type. Then we interpret the work of Burstall and Guest on harmonic maps of finite
uniton type into compact (semi-simple) Lie groups in terms of the language of the DPW method. Moreover,
to make the work of Burstall and Guest applicable to our setting we show that a harmonic map into a non-compact
inner symmetric space $G/K$ shares the normalized potential as well as the meromorphic extended
framing with a harmonic map into $U/(U\cap K^{\mathbb{C}})$, the compact dual of $G/K$. Thus we
reduce the description of harmonic maps of finite uniton type into a non-compact inner symmetric
space to the description of harmonic maps of finite uniton type into a compact inner symmetric space.
Our main goal for the study of such harmonic maps is to provide a classification of Willmore two-spheres
(whose conformal Gauss maps take value in the non-compact symmetric space $SO^+(1,n+3)/SO(1,3)\times
SO(n)$ ). We will finish this paper by presenting the coarse classification of Willmore two-spheres
in terms of their conformal Gauss maps [28] as well as a new Willmore two-sphere constructed by using
[13] and the results of this paper.
