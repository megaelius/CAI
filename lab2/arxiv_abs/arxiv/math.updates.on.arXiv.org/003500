A general framework is proposed that includes polar codes over arbitrary channels with arbitrary
kernels. The asymptotic tradeoff among block length $N$, code rate $R$, and error probability $P$
is analyzed. Given a tradeoff between $N,P$ and a tradeoff between $N,R$, we return an interpolating
tradeoff among $N,R,P$ (Theorem 5). $\def\Capacity{\text{Capacity}}$Quantitatively, if $P=\exp(-N^{\beta^*})$
is possible for some $\beta^*$ and if $R=\Capacity-N^{1/\mu^*}$ is possible for some $1/\mu^*$,
then $(P,R)=(\exp(-N^{\beta'}),\Capacity-N^{-1/\mu'})$ is possible for some pair $(\beta',1/\mu')$
determined by $\beta^*$, $1/\mu^*$, and auxiliary information. In fancy words, an error exponent
regime tradeoff plus a scaling exponent regime tradeoff implies a moderate deviations regime tradeoff.
The current world records are: [arXiv:1304.4321][arXiv:1501.02444][arXiv:1806.02405] analyzing
Ar{\i}kan's codes over BEC; [arXiv:1706.02458] analyzing Ar{\i}kan's codes over AWGN; and [arXiv:1802.02718][arXiv:1810.04298]
analyzing general codes over general channels. An attempt is made to generalize all at once (Section
IX). As a corollary, a grafted variant of polar coding almost catches up the code rate and error probability
of random codes with complexity slightly larger than $N\log N$ over BEC. In particular, $(P,R)=(\exp(-N^{.33}),\Capacity-N^{-.33})$
is possible (Corollary 10). In fact, all points in this triangle are possible $(\beta',1/\mu')$-pairs.
