In this work, we investigate a novel setting of Markovian loop measures and introduce a new class
of loop measures called Bosonic loop measures. Namely, we consider loop soups with varying intensity
$ \mu\le 0 $ (chemical potential in physics terms), and secondly, we study Markovian loop measures
on graphs with an additional "time" dimension leading to so-called space-time random walks and
their loop measures and Poisson point loop processes. Interesting phenomena appear when the additional
coordinate of the space-time process is on a discrete torus with non-symmetric jump rates. The projection
of these space-time random walk loop measures onto the space dimensions are loop measures on the
spatial graph, and in the scaling limit of the discrete torus, these loop measures converge to the
so-called [Bosonic loop measures]. This provides a natural probabilistic definition of [Bosonic
loop measures]. These novel loop measures have similarities with the standard Markovian loop measures
only that they give weights to loops of certain lengths, namely any length which is multiple of a given
length $ \beta> 0 $ which serves as an additional parameter. We complement our study with generalised
versions of Dynkin's isomorphism theorem (including a version for the whole complex field) as well
as Symanzik's moment formulae for complex Gaussian measures. Due to the lacking symmetry of our
space-time random walks, the distributions of the occupation time fields are given in terms of complex
Gaussian measures over complex-valued random fields ([B92,BIS09]. Our space-time setting allows
obtaining quantum correlation functions as torus limits of space-time correlation functions.
