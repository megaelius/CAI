In this paper, we study the resource allocation algorithm design for multiple-input single-output
(MISO) multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) systems, in which a full-duplex
base station serves multiple half-duplex uplink and downlink users on the same subcarrier simultaneously.
The resource allocation is optimized for maximization of the weighted system throughput while
the information leakage is constrained and artificial noise is injected to guarantee secure communication
in the presence of multiple potential eavesdroppers. To this end, we formulate a robust non-convex
optimization problem taking into account the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the
eavesdropping channels and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the legitimate users.
Despite the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying monotonic
optimization which yields the optimal beamforming, artificial noise design, subcarrier allocation,
and power allocation policy. The optimal resource allocation policy serves as a performance benchmark
since the corresponding monotonic optimization based algorithm entails a high computational
complexity. Hence, we also develop a low-complexity suboptimal resource allocation algorithm
which converges to a locally optimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that the performance
of the suboptimal algorithm closely approaches that of the optimal algorithm. Besides, the proposed
optimal MISO NOMA system can not only ensure downlink and uplink communication security simultaneously
but also provides a significant system secrecy rate improvement compared to traditional MISO orthogonal
multiple access (OMA) systems and two other baseline schemes.
