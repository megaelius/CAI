In this paper, we propose to use the discretized version of the so-called Enhanced Gaussian Noise
(EGN) model to estimate the non-linearity effects of fiber on the performance of optical coherent
and uncompensated transmission (CUT) systems. By computing the power of non-linear interference
noise and considering optical amplifier noise, we obtain the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and achievable
rate of CUT. To allocate the power of each CUT channel, we consider two optimization problems with
the objectives of maximizing minimum SNR margin and achievable rate. We show that by using the discretized
EGN model, the complexity of the introduced optimization problems is reduced compared with the
existing optimization problems developed based on the so-called discretized Gaussian Noise (GN)
model. In addition, the optimization based on the discretized EGN model leads to a better SNR and
achievable rate. We validate our analytical results with simulations and experimental results.
We simulate a five-channel coherent system on OptiSystem software, where a close agreement is observed
between optimizations and simulations. Furthermore, we measured SNR of commercial 100Gbps coherent
transmitter over 300 km single-mode fiber (SMF) and non-zero dispersion-shifted fiber (NZDSF),
by considering single-channel and three-channel coherent systems. We observe there are performance
gaps between experimental and analytical results, which is mainly due to other sources of noise
such as transmitter imperfection noise, thermal noise, and shot noise, in experiments. By including
these sources of noise in the analytical model, the gaps between analytical and experimental results
are reduced.
