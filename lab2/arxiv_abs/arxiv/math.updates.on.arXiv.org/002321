Multi-patch spline parametrizations are used in geometric design and isogeometric analysis to
represent complex domains. We deal with a particular class of $C^0$ planar multi-patch spline parametrizations
called analysis-suitable $G^1$ (AS-$G^{1}$) multi-patch parametrizations (Collin, Sangalli,
Takacs; CAGD, 2016). This class of parametrizations has to satisfy specific geometric continuity
constraints, and is of importance since it allows to construct, on the multi-patch domain, $C^1$
isogeometric spaces with optimal approximation properties. It was demonstrated in (Kapl, Sangalli,
Takacs; CAD, 2018) that AS-$G^1$ multi-patch parametrizations are suitable for modeling complex
planar multi-patch domains. In this work, we construct a basis, and an associated dual basis, for
a specific $C^1$ isogeometric spline space $\mathcal{W}$ over a given AS-$G^1$ multi-patch parametrization.
We call the space $\mathcal{W}$ the Argyris isogeometric space, since it is $C^1$ across interfaces
and $C^2$ at all vertices and generalizes the idea of Argyris finite elements to tensor-product
splines. The considered space $\mathcal{W}$ is a subspace of the entire $C^1$ isogeometric space
$\mathcal{V}^{1}$, which maintains the reproduction properties of traces and normal derivatives
along the interfaces. Moreover, it reproduces all derivatives up to second order at the vertices.
In contrast to $\mathcal{V}^{1}$, the dimension of $\mathcal{W}$ does not depend on the domain
parametrization, and $\mathcal{W}$ admits a basis and dual basis which possess a simple explicit
representation and local support. We conclude the paper with some numerical experiments, which
exhibit the optimal approximation order of the Argyris isogeometric space $\mathcal{W}$ and demonstrate
the applicability of our approach for isogeometric analysis.
