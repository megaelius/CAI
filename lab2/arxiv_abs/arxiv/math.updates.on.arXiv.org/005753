Coupled cell systems associated with a coupled cell network are determined by (smooth) vector fields
that are consistent with the network structure. Here, we follow the formalisms of Stewart, Golubitsky
and Pivato (Symmetry groupoids and patterns of synchrony in coupled cell networks, SIAM J. Appl.
Dyn. Syst. 2 (4) (2003) 609--646), Golubistky, Stewart and Torok (Patterns of synchrony in coupled
cell networks with multiple arrows, SIAM J. Appl. Dynam. Sys. 4 (1) (2005) 78--100) and Field (Combinatorial
dynamics, Dynamical Systems 19 (2004) (3) 217--243). It is known that two non-isomorphic n-cell
coupled networks can determine the same sets of vector fields -- these networks are said to be ODE-equivalent.
The set of all n-cell coupled networks is so partitioned into classes of ODE-equivalent networks.
With no further restrictions, the number of ODE-classes is not finite and each class has an infinite
number of networks. Inside each ODE-class we can find a finite subclass of networks that minimize
the number of edges in the class, called minimal networks. In this paper, we consider coupled cell
networks with asymmetric inputs. That is, if k is the number of distinct edges types, these networks
have the property that every cell receives k inputs, one of each type. Fixing the number n of cells,
we prove that: the number of ODE-classes is finite; restricting to a maximum of n(n-1) inputs, we
can cover all the ODE-classes; all minimal n-cell networks with n(n-1) asymmetric inputs are ODE-equivalent.
We also give a simple criterion to test if a network is minimal and we conjecture lower estimates for
the number of distinct ODE-classes of n-cell networks with any number k of asymmetric inputs. Moreover,
we present a full list of representatives of the ODE-classes of networks with three cells and two
asymmetric inputs.
