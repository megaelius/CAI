This is the first of two articles aiming to introduce symplectic spinors into the field of symplectic
topology and the subject of Frobenius structures. After exhibiting a (tentative) axiomating setting
for Frobenius structures resp. 'Higgs pairs' in the context of symplectic spinors, we present immediate
observations concerning a local Schroedinger equation, the first structure connection and the
existence of 'spectrum', its topological interpretation and its connection to 'formality' which
are valid for the case of standard semisimple Frobenius structures. We give a classification of
the irreducibles of the latter in terms of certain $U(n)$-reductions of the $G$-extension of the
metaplectic frame bundle and a certain connection on it, where $G$ is the semi-direct product of
the metaplectic group and the Heisenberg group In the second part, we associate a semisimple Frobenius
structure to any Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\Phi$ on a cotangent bundle $T^*\tilde M$ by letting
elements of $T(T^*\tilde M)$ act on a line bundle $E$ on $T^*\tilde M$ spanned by 'coherent states'.
The spectral Lagrangian in $T^*(T^*\tilde M)$ associated to this Frobenius structure intersects
the zero-section $T^*\tilde M$ exactly at the fixed points of $\Phi$. We give lower bounds for the
number of fixed points of $\Phi$ by defining a $C^*$-valued function on $T^*\tilde M$ defined by
matrix coeficients of the Heisenberg group acting on spinors, where $\tilde M$ is a certain 'complexification'
of $M$, whose critical points are in bijection to the fixed points of $\Phi$ resp. to the intersection
of the spectral Lagrangian with the zero section of $T^*\tilde M$. We discuss how to define spectral
invariants in the sense of Viterbo and Oh by lifting the above function to a real-valued function
on an appropriate cyclic covering of $T^*\tilde M$ and using minimax-methods for 'half-infinite'
chains.
