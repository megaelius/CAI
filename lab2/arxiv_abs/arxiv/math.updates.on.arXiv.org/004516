Let A be a symmetrizable hyperbolic generalized Cartan matrix with Kac-Moody algebra g = g(A) and
(adjoint) Kac-Moody group G = G(A)= <exp(ad(t e_i)),exp(ad(t f_i)) |t in C> where e_i and f_i are
the simple root vectors. Let (B+, B-, N) be the twin BN-pair naturally associated to G and let (\cB+,\cB-)
be the corresponding twin building with Weyl group W and natural G-action, which respects the usual
W-valued distance and codistance functions. This work connects the twin building (\cB+,\cB-)
of G and the Kac-Moody algebra g = g(A) in a new geometrical way. The Cartan-Chevalley involution,
\omega, of g has fixed point real subalgebra, k, the `compact' (unitary) real form of g, and k contains
the compact Cartan t = k \cap h. We show that a real bilinear form (.,.) is Lorentzian with signatures
(1,\infty) on k, and (1, n-1) on t. We define {k | (k,k) <= 0} to be the lightcone of k, and similarly for
t. Let K be the compact (unitary) real form of G, that is, the fixed point subgroup of the lifting of
\omega to G. We construct a K-equivariant embedding of the twin building of G into the lightcone of
the compact real form k of g. Our embedding gives a geometric model of part of the twin building, where
each half consists of infinitely many copies of a W-tessellated hyperbolic space glued together
along hyperplanes of the faces. Locally, at each such face, we find an SU(2)-orbit of chambers stabilized
by U(1) which is thus parametrized by a Riemann sphere SU(2)/U(1) = S^2. For n = 2 the twin building
is a twin tree. In this case, we construct our embedding explicitly and we describe the action of the
real root groups on the fundamental twin apartment. We also construct a spherical twin building
at infinity, and construct an embedding of it into the set of rays on the boundary of the lightcone.
