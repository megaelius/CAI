In this paper we compute the homology Hirzebruch characteristic classes of (possibly singular)
toric varieties, which in the context of complete simplicial toric varieties fit nicely with a generalized
Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem. As important special cases, we obtain new (or recover well-known)
formulae for the Baum-Fulton-MacPherson Todd (or MacPherson-Chern) classes of toric varieties,
as well as for the Thom-Milnor L-classes of simplicial projective toric varieties. We present two
different perspectives for the computation of these characteristic classes of toric varieties.
First, we take advantage of the torus-orbit decomposition and the motivic properties of the homology
Hirzebruch classes to express the latter in terms of the (dual) Todd classes of closures of orbits.
The obtained formula is then applied to weighted lattice point counting in lattice polytopes, yielding
parametrized Pick-type formulae for lattice polygones. Secondly, in the case of simplicial toric
varieties, we compute our characteristic classes by using the Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorem
of Edidin-Graham in the context of the geometric quotient description of such varieties. In this
setting, we define mock Hirzebruch classes of simplicial toric varieties (which specialize to
the mock Chern, mock Todd and mock L-classes of such varieties) and investigate the difference between
the (actual) homology Hirzebruch class and the mock Hirzebruch class. We show that this difference
is localized on the singular locus, and we obtain a formula for it in which the contribution of each
singular cone is identified explicitly. Finally, the two methods of computing characteristic
classes are combined for proving several characteristic class formulae originally obtained by
Cappell and Shaneson in the early 1990s.
