In this paper we study the fundamental solution $\varGamma(t,x;\tau,\xi)$ of the parabolic operator
$L_{t}=\partial_{t}-\Delta+b(t,x)\cdot\nabla$, where for every $t$, $b(t,\cdot)$ is a divergence-free
vector field, and we consider the case that $b$ belongs to the Lebesgue space $L^{l}\left(0,T;L^{q}\left(\mathbb{R}^{n}\right)\right)$.
The regularity of weak solutions to the parabolic equation $L_{t}u=0$ depends critically on the
value of the parabolic exponent $\gamma=\frac{2}{l}+\frac{n}{q}$. Without the divergence-free
condition on $b$, the regularity of weak solutions has been established when $\gamma\leq1$, and
the heat kernel estimate has been obtained as well, except for the case that $l=\infty,q=n$. The
regularity of weak solutions was deemed not true for the critical case $L^{\infty}\left(0,T;L^{n}\left(\mathbb{R}^{n}\right)\right)$
for a general $b$, while it is true for the divergence-free case, and a written proof can be deduced
from the results in [Semenov, 2006]. One of the results obtained in the present paper establishes
the Aronson type estimate for critical and supercritical cases and for vector fields $b$ which are
divergence-free. We will prove the best possible lower and upper bounds for the fundamental solution
one can derive under the current approach. The significance of the divergence-free condition enters
the study of parabolic equations rather recently, mainly due to the discovery of the compensated
compactness. The interest for the study of such parabolic equations comes from its connections
with Leray's weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations and the Taylor diffusion associated
with a vector field where the heat operator $L_{t}$ appears naturally.
