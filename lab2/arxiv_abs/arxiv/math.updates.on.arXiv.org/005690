We propose an algorithm for Gaussian Process regression on an unknown embedded manifold in a Euclidean
space by using the heat kernel of the manifold as the covariance kernel in the Gaussian Process. It
is not straightforward to define a valid covariance kernel for the Gaussian process regression
when the predictors are on a manifold. Although the heat kernel provides a natural and canonical
choice theoretically, it is analytically intractable to directly evaluate, and current Bayesian
methods rely on computationally demanding Monte Carlo approximations. We instead develop a computationally
efficient and accurate approximation to the heat kernel relying on the diffusion property of the
graph Laplacian, leading to a diffusion-based Gaussian process (DB-GP) modeling framework. In
the manifold setting, we provide a series of spectral convergence results quantifying how the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian converge to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator in the $L^\infty$ sense. The convergence rate is also provided. Based on these results,
convergence of the proposed heat kernel approximation algorithm, as well as the convergence rate,
to the exact heat kernel is guaranteed. To our knowledge, this is the first work exploring the spectral
convergence in the $L^\infty$ sense and providing a numerical heat kernel reconstruction from
the point cloud with theoretical guarantees. We also discuss the performance when there are measurement
errors in the predictors, so that they do not fall exactly on the embedded manifold. Simulations
illustrate performance gains for the proposed approach over traditional approaches.
