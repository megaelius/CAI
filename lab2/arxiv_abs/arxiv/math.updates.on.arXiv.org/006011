In this paper, we focus on solving a distributed convex optimization problem in a network, where
each agent has its own convex cost function and the goal is to minimize the sum of the agents' cost functions
while obeying the network connectivity structure. In order to minimize the sum of the cost functions,
we consider new distributed gradient-based methods where each node maintains two estimates, namely,
an estimate of the optimal decision variable and an estimate of the gradient for the average of the
agents' objective functions. From the viewpoint of an agent, the information about the gradients
is pushed to the neighbors, while the information about the decision variable is pulled from the
neighbors hence giving the name "push-pull gradient methods". The methods utilize two different
graphs for the information exchange among agents, and as such, unify the algorithms with different
types of distributed architecture, including decentralized (peer-to-peer), centralized (master-slave),
and semi-centralized (leader-follower) architecture. We show that the proposed algorithms and
their many variants converge linearly for strongly convex and smooth objective functions over
a network (possibly with unidirectional data links) in both synchronous and asynchronous random-gossip
settings. In particular, under the random-gossip setting, "push-pull" is the first class of algorithms
for distributed optimization over directed graphs. Moreover, we numerically evaluate our proposed
algorithms in both scenarios, and show that they outperform other existing linearly convergent
schemes, especially for ill-conditioned problems and networks that are not well balanced.
