The universal Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariant is a functor from the category of tangles to a certain
graded category of chord diagrams, compatible with the Vassiliev filtration and whose associated
graded is an isomorphism. The Vassiliev filtration has a natural extension to tangles in any thickened
surface $M\times I$ but the corresponding category of diagrams lacks some finiteness properties
which are essential to the above construction. We suggest to overcome this obstruction by studying
families of Vassiliev invariants which, roughly, are associated to finite coverings of $M$. In
the case $M=\C^*$, it leads for each positive integer $N$ to a filtration on the space of tangles in
$\C^* \times I$ (or "B-tangles"). We first prove an extension of the Shum--Reshetikhin--Turaev
theorem in the framework of braided module category leading to B-tangles invariants. We introduce
a category of "$N$-chord diagrams", and use a cyclotomic generalization of Drinfeld associators,
introduced by Enriquez, to put a braided module category structure on it. We show that the corresponding
functor from the category of B-tangles is a universal invariant with respect to the $N$ filtration.
We show that Vassiliev invariants in the usual sense are well approximated by $N$ finite type invariants.
We show that specializations of the universal invariant can be constructed from modules over a metrizable
Lie algebra equipped with a finite order automorphism preserving the metric. In the case the latter
is a "Cartan" automorphism, we use a previous work of the author to compute these invariants explicitly
using quantum groups. Restricted to links, this construction provides polynomial invariants.
