A new method for the design of linear-phase robust far-field broadband beamformers using constrained
optimization is proposed. In the method, the maximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation
are ensured to be within prescribed levels, while at the same time maintaining a good linear-phase
characteristic at a prescribed group delay in the passband. Since the beamformer is intended primarily
for small-sized microphone arrays where the microphone spacing is small relative to the wavelength
at low frequencies, the beamformer can become highly sensitive to spatial white noise and array
imperfections if a direct minimization of the error is performed. Therefore, to limit the sensitivity
of the beamformer the optimization is carried out by constraining a sensitivity parameter, namely,
the white noise gain (WNG) to be above prescribed levels across the frequency band. Two novel design
variants have been developed. The first variant is formulated as a convex optimization problem
where the maximum error in the passband is minimized, while the second variant is formulated as an
iterative optimization problem and has the advantage of significantly improving the linear-phase
characteristics of the beamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear-array configuration.
In the second variant, the passband group-delay deviation is minimized while ensuring that the
maximum passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within prescribed levels. To reduce the computational
effort in carrying out the optimization, a nonuniform variable sampling approach over the frequency
and angular dimensions is used to compute the required parameters. Experiment results show that
beamformers designed using the proposed methods have much smaller passband group-delay deviation
for similar passband ripple and stopband attenuation than a modified version of an existing method.
