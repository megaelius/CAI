Let $\mathrm{R}$ be a real closed field, $d,k \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$, $\mathbf{y} =(y_1,\ldots,y_d)
\in \mathrm{R}^d$, and let $V_{d,\mathbf{y}}^{(k)}$ denote the Vandermonde variety defined
by $p_1^{(k)} = y_1, \ldots, p_d^{(k)} = y_d$, where $p_j^{(k)} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} X_i^j$. Then,
the cohomology groups $\mathrm{H}^*(V_{d,\mathbf{y}}^{(k)},\mathbb{Q})$ have the structure
of $\mathfrak{S}_k$-modules. We prove that for all partitions $\lambda \vdash k$, and $3 < d \leq
k$, the multiplicity of the Specht module $\mathbb{S}^\lambda$ in $\mathrm{H}^i(V_{d,\mathbf{y}}^{(k)},\mathbb{Q})$,
is zero if $\mathrm{length}(\lambda) \geq i+ 2d - 1$. This vanishing result allows us to prove similar
vanishing result for arbitrary symmetric semi-algebraic sets defined by symmetric polynomials
of degrees bounded by $d$. As an application, we obtain for each fixed $\ell, d \geq 0$, an algorithm
that takes as input a quantifier-free first order formula $\Phi$ with atoms $P=0, P > 0, P < 0, P \in
\mathcal{P} \subset \mathrm{D}[X_1,\ldots,X_k]^{\mathfrak{S}_k}_{\leq d}$, where $\mathrm{D}$
is an ordered domain contained in $\mathrm{R}$, and computes the isotypic decomposition, as well
as the ranks of the first $(\ell+1)$ cohomology groups, of the symmetric semi-algebraic set defined
by $\Phi$. The complexity of this algorithm (measured by the number of arithmetic operations in
$\mathrm{D}$) is bounded by a polynomial in $k$ and $\mathrm{card}(\mathcal{P})$ (for fixed $d$
and $\ell$). This result contrasts with the $\mathbf{PSPACE}$-hardness of the problem of computing
just the number of semi algebraically connected components (i.e. the rank of $0$-th cohomology
group) in the general (non-symmetric) case for $d \geq 2$, a result due to Reif.
