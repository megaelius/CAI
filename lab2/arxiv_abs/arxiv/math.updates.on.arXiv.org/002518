This paper continues our study of algebras of bounded, noncommutative (nc) holomorphic functions
on nc subvarieties of the nc unit ball $\mathfrak{B}_d$ (where $d \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$).
Given a nc variety $\mathfrak{V}$ in the nc unit ball $\mathfrak{B}_d$, we consider the algebra
$H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$ of bounded nc holomorphic functions on $\mathfrak{V}$. We find that
the finite dimensional and weak-$*$ continuous representations are parametrized by the similarity
envelope $\widetilde{\mathfrak{V}}$ of $\mathfrak{V}$. Therefore, $H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$
can be considered as a certain subalgebra of nc holomorphic functions on $\widetilde{\mathfrak{V}}$.
We investigate the problem of when two algebras $H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$ and $H^\infty(\mathfrak{W})$
are isomorphic. In full generality, we prove that these algebras are weak-$*$ continuously isomorphic
if and only if there is a nc biholomorphism $G : \widetilde{\mathfrak{W}} \to \widetilde{\mathfrak{V}}$
that is bi-Lipschitz with respect to the free pseudo-hyperbolic metric. Moreover, such an isomorphism
always has the form $f \mapsto f \circ G$, where $G$ is a nc biholomorphism. These results also shed
some new light on automorphisms of the noncommutative analytic Toeplitz algebras $H^\infty(\mathfrak{B}_d)$
studied by Davidson-Pitts and by Popescu. When $d<\infty$ and the varieties are homogeneous, we
remove the weak-$*$ continuity assumption, showing that two such algebras are boundedly isomorphic
if and only if there is a bi-Lipschitz nc biholomorphism between the similarity envelopes of the
nc varieties; further, we show that such a biholomorphism can be replaced by a linear map. We discuss
completely bounded versions of the above classification results, and it turns out that in the homogeneous
case, two algebras are boundedly isomorphic if and only if they are completely boundedly isomorphic.
