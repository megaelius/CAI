We construct an explicit family of linear rank-metric codes over any field ${\mathbb F}_h$ that
enables efficient list decoding up to a fraction $\rho$ of errors in the rank metric with a rate of
$1-\rho-\epsilon$, for any desired $\rho \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Previously, a Monte
Carlo construction of such codes was known, but this is in fact the first explicit construction of
positive rate rank-metric codes for list decoding beyond the unique decoding radius. Our codes
are subcodes of the well-known Gabidulin codes, which encode linearized polynomials of low degree
via their values at a collection of linearly independent points. The subcode is picked by restricting
the message polynomials to an ${\mathbb F}_h$-subspace that evades the structured subspaces over
an extension field ${\mathbb F}_{h^t}$ that arise in the linear-algebraic list decoder for Gabidulin
codes due to Guruswami and Xing (STOC'13). This subspace is obtained by combining subspace designs
contructed by Guruswami and Kopparty (FOCS'13) with subspace evasive varieties due to Dvir and
Lovett (STOC'12). We establish a similar result for subspace codes, which are a collection of subspaces,
every pair of which have low-dimensional intersection, and which have received much attention
recently in the context of network coding. We also give explicit subcodes of folded Reed-Solomon
(RS) codes with small folding order that are list-decodable (in the Hamming metric) with optimal
redundancy, motivated by the fact that list decoding RS codes reduces to list decoding such folded
RS codes. However, as we only list decode a subcode of these codes, the Johnson radius continues to
be the best known error fraction for list decoding RS codes.
