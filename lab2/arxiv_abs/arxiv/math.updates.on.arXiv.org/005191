The selection of a specific statistical distribution is seldom a simple problem. One strategy consists
in testing different distributions (normal, lognormal, Weibull, etc.), and selecting the one
providing the best fit to the observed data and being the most parsimonious. Alternatively, one
can make a choice based on theoretical arguments and simply fit the corresponding parameters to
the observed data. In either case, different distributions can give similar results and provide
almost equivalent results. Model selection can be more complicated when the goal is to describe
a trend in the distribution of a given variable. In those cases, changes in shape and skewness are
difficult to represent by a single distributional form. As an alternative to the use of complicated
families of distributions as models for data, the S-distribution [{\sc Voit, E.O. }(1992) Biom.J.
7:855-878] provides a highly flexible mathematical form in which the density is defined as a function
of the cumulative. Besides representing well-known distributions, S-distributions provide
an infinity of new possibilities that do not correspond with known classical distributions. In
this paper we obtain an analytical solution for the quantile equation that highly simplifies the
use of S-distributions. We show the utility of this solution in different applications. After classifying
the different qualitative behaviors of the S-distribution in parameter space, we show how to obtain
different S-distributions that accomplish specific constraints. One interesting case is the
possibility of obtaining distributions that acomplish P(X <= X_c)=0. Then, we show that the quantile
solution facilitates the use of S-distributions in Monte-Carlo experiments through the generation
of random samples. Finally, we show how to fit an S-distribution to actual data, so that the resulting
distribution can be used as a statistical model for them.
