The current article stems from our study on the asymptotic behavior of holomorphic isometric embeddings
of the Poincar\'e disk into bounded symmetric domains. As a first result we prove that any holomorphic
curve exiting the boundary of a bounded symmetric domain $\Omega$ must necessarily be asymptotically
totally geodesic. Assuming otherwise we derive by the method of rescaling a hypothetical holomorphic
isometric embedding of the Poincar\'e disk with ${\rm Aut}(\Omega')$-equivalent tangent spaces
into a tube domain $\Omega' \subset \Omega$ and derive a contradiction by means of the Poincar\'e-Lelong
equation. We deduce that equivariant holomorphic embeddings between bounded symmetric domains
must be totally geodesic. Furthermore, we solve a uniformization problem on algebraic subsets
$Z \subset \Omega$. More precisely, if $\check \Gamma\subset {\rm Aut}(\Omega)$ is a torsion-free
discrete subgroup leaving $Z$ invariant such that $Z/\check \Gamma$ is compact, we prove that $Z
\subset \Omega$ is totally geodesic. In particular, letting $\Gamma \subset{\rm Aut}(\Omega)$
be a torsion-free lattice, and $\pi: \Omega \to \Omega/\Gamma =: X_\Gamma$ be the uniformization
map, a subvariety $Y \subset X_\Gamma$ must be totally geodesic whenever some (and hence any) irreducible
component $Z$ of $\pi^{-1}(Y)$ is an algebraic subset of $\Omega$. For cocompact lattices this
yields a characterization of totally geodesic subsets of $X_\Gamma$ by means of bi-algebraicity
without recourse to the celebrated monodromy result of Andr\'e-Deligne on subvarieties of Shimura
varieties, and as such our proof applies to not necessarily arithmetic cocompact lattices.
