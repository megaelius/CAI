In order to define a paradigm of sustainability for human development and our co-evolution with
the earth system, Rockstr\"om et al. [58] introduced Planetary boundaries with superseding refinements
by Steffen et al. [66]. They are a set of planetary-scale thresholds whose transgression may be catastrophic
for the earth system. The question of their interaction with each other and their relations to Social
Foundations [56], demanding normative human-oriented boundaries, have been under intensive
investigation. The framework on Topology of Sustainable Management (tsm) developed by Heitzig
et al. [30] shed a new light on the understanding of boundaries and how complex structures in state
space corresponding to a hierarchy of safety levels may occur when taking the dynamics of the system
and possible management options into account. In this paper, we present a variant definition of
tsm based on viability theory (vt), a subfield of control theory. This enables us to use the Saint-Pierre
algorithm in order to estimate the main partition of the tsm-framework, meaning we make the first
step on the way of operationalization of tsm. Furthermore, we present an extension of the algorithm
to compute implicitly defined capture basins, a notion from vt that is more elaborated in the article,
as these come up in tsm. We use a low-complexity model coupling environmental and socio-economic
dynamics to demonstrate the applicability of this approach. Furthermore, two common problems
of estimations in viability theory are critical for this example: (i) the unbounded state space
and (ii) the highly varying time scales. We solve both by introducing appropriate mappings and these
solutions are applicable for general systems, too.
