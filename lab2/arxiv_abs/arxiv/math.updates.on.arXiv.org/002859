Observable currents are locally defined gauge invariant conserved currents; physical observables
may be calculated integrating them on appropriate hypersurfaces. Due to the conservation law the
hypersurfaces become irrelevant up to homology, and the main objects of interest become the observable
currents them selves. Gauge inequivalent solutions can be distinguished by means of observable
currents. With the aim of modeling spacetime local physics, we work on spacetime domains $U\subset
M$ which may have boundaries and corners. Hamiltonian observable currents are those satisfying
${\sf d_v}F=-\iota_V\Omega_L+{\sf d_h}\sigma^F$ and a certain boundary condition. The family
of Hamiltonian observable currents is endowed with a bracket that gives it a structure which generalizes
a Lie algebra in which the Jacobi relation is modified by the presence of a boundary term. If the domain
of interest has no boundaries the resulting algebra of observables is a Lie algebra. In the resulting
framework algebras of observable currents are associated to bounded domains, and the local algebras
obey interesting gluing properties. These results are due to considering currents that defined
only locally in field space and to a revision of the concept of gauge invariance in bounded spacetime
domains. A perturbation of the field on a bounded spacetime domain is regarded as gauge if: (i) the
"first order holographic imprint" that it leaves in any hypersurface locally splitting a spacetime
domain into two subdomains is negligible according to the linearized gluing field equation, and
(ii) the perturbation vanishes at the boundary of the domain. A current is gauge invariant if the
variation in them induced by any gauge perturbation vanishes up to boundary terms.
