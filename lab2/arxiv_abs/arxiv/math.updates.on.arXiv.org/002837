Persistent homology is a powerful tool for characterizing the topology of a data set at various geometric
scales. When applied to the description of molecular structures, persistent homology can capture
the multiscale geometric features and reveal certain interaction patterns in terms of topological
invariants. However, in addition to the geometric information, there is a wide variety of non-geometric
information of molecular structures, such as element types, atomic partial charges, atomic pairwise
interactions, and electrostatic potential function, that is not described by persistent homology.
Although element specific homology and electrostatic persistent homology can encode some non-geometric
information into geometry based topological invariants, it is desirable to have a mathematical
framework to systematically embed both geometric and non-geometric information, i.e., multicomponent
heterogeneous information, into unified topological descriptions. To this end, we propose a mathematical
framework based on persistent cohomology. In our framework, non-geometric information can be
either distributed globally or resided locally on the datasets in the geometric sense and can be
properly defined on topological spaces, i.e., simplicial complexes. Using the proposed persistent
cohomology based framework, enriched barcodes are extracted from datasets to represent heterogeneous
information. We consider a variety of datasets to validate the present formulation and illustrate
the usefulness of the proposed persistent cohomology. It is found that the proposed framework using
cohomology boosts the performance of persistent homology based methods in the protein-ligand
binding affinity prediction on massive biomolecular datasets.
