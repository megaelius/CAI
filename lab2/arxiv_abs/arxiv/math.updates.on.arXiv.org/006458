Replica-mean-field models have been proposed to decipher the activity of neural networks via a
multiply-and-conquer approach. In this approach, one considers limit networks made of infinitely
many replicas with the same basic neural structure as that of the network of interest, but exchanging
spikes in a randomized manner. The key point is that these replica-mean-field networks are tractable
versions that retain important features of the finite structure of interest. To date, the replica
framework has been discussed for first-order models, whereby elementary replica constituents
are single neurons with independent Poisson inputs. Here, we extend this replica framework to allow
elementary replica constituents to be composite objects, namely, pairs of neurons. As they include
pairwise interactions, these pair-replica models exhibit non-trivial dependencies in their
stationary dynamics, which cannot be captured by first-order replica models. Our contributions
are two-fold: $(i)$ We analytically characterize the stationary dynamics of a pair of intensity-based
neurons with independent Poisson input. This analysis involves the reduction of a boundary-value
problem related to a two-dimensional transport equation to a system of Fredholm integral equations---a
result of independent interest. $(ii)$ We analyze the set of consistency equations determining
the full network dynamics of certain replica limits. These limits are those for which replica constituents,
be they single neurons or pairs of neurons, form a partition of the network of interest. Both analyses
are numerically validated by computing input/output transfer functions for neuronal pairs and
by computing the correlation structure of certain pair-dominated network dynamics.
