The truncated singular value decomposition may be used to find the solution of linear discrete ill-posed
problems in conjunction with Tikhonov regularization and requires the estimation of a regularization
parameter that balances between the sizes of the fit to data function and the regularization term.
The unbiased predictive risk estimator is one suggested method for finding the regularization
parameter when the noise in the measurements is normally distributed with known variance. In this
paper we provide an algorithm using the unbiased predictive risk estimator that automatically
finds both the regularization parameter and the number of terms to use from the singular value decomposition.
Underlying the algorithm is a new result that proves that the regularization parameter converges
with the number of terms from the singular value decomposition. For the analysis it is sufficient
to assume that the discrete Picard condition is satisfied for exact data and that noise completely
contaminates the measured data coefficients for a sufficiently large number of terms, dependent
on both the noise level and the degree of ill-posedness of the system. A lower bound for the regularization
parameter is provided leading to a computationally efficient algorithm. Supporting results are
compared with those obtained using the method of generalized cross validation. Simulations for
two-dimensional examples verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the algorithm
for increasing noise levels, and demonstrate that the relative reconstruction errors obtained
using the truncated singular value decomposition are less than those obtained using the singular
value decomposition. This is a pre-print of an article published in BIT Numerical Mathematics.
