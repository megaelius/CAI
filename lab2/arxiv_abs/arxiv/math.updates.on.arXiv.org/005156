We consider the motion of several solids in a bounded cavity filled with a perfect incompressible
fluid, in two dimensions. The solids move according to Newton's law, under the influence of the fluid's
pressure, and the fluid dynamics is driven by the 2D incompressible Euler equations, which are set
on the time-dependent domain corresponding to the cavity deprived of the sets occupied by the solids.
We assume that the fluid vorticity is initially bounded and that the circulations around the solids
may be non-zero. The existence of a unique corresponding solution, \`a la Yudovich, to this system,
up to a possible collision, is known. In this paper we identify the limit dynamics of the system when
the radius of some of the solids converge to zero depending on how, for each body, the inertia is scaled
with the radius. We obtain in the limit some point vortex systems for the solids converging to particles
and a form of Newton's law for the solids that have a fixed radius; for the fluid we obtain an Euler-type
system. This extends earlier works to the case of several moving rigid bodies. A crucial point is
to understand the interaction, through the fluid, between small moving solids, and for that we use
some normal forms of the ODEs driving the motion of the solids in two steps: first we use a normal form
for the system coupling the time-evolution of all the solids to obtain a rough estimate of the acceleration
of the bodies, then we turn to some normal forms that are specific to each small solid, with an appropriate
modulation related to the influence of the other solids and of the fluid vorticity, to obtain some
precise uniform a priori estimates of the velocities of the bodies, and then pass to the limit.
