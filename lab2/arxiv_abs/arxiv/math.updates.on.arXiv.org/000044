In this paper we study rebalancing strategies for a mobility-on-demand urban transportation system
blending customer-driven vehicles with a taxi service. In our system, a customer arrives at one
of many designated stations and is transported to any other designated station, either by driving
themselves, or by being driven by an employed driver. The system allows for one-way trips, so that
customers do not have to return to their origin. When some origins and destinations are more popular
than others, vehicles will become unbalanced, accumulating at some stations and becoming depleted
at others. This problem is addressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the
popular destinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the rebalancing
drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to "rebalance the rebalancers" by letting them
travel back to the popular destinations with a customer. Accordingly, in this paper we study how
to optimally route the rebalancing vehicles and drivers so that stability (in terms of boundedness
of the number of waiting customers) is ensured while minimizing the number of rebalancing vehicles
traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing drivers needed; surprisingly, these two
objectives are aligned, and one can find the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled
linear programs. Leveraging our analysis, we determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum
number of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Interestingly, our simulations suggest
that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would need between 1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles.
