The operation and planning of large-scale power systems are becoming more challenging with the
increasing penetration of stochastic renewable generation. In order to minimize the decision
risks in power systems with large amount of renewable resources, there is a growing need to model
the short-term generation uncertainty. By producing a group of possible future realizations for
certain set of renewable generation plants, scenario approach has become one popular way for renewables
uncertainty modeling. However, due to the complex spatial and temporal correlations underlying
in renewable generations, traditional model-based approaches for forecasting future scenarios
often require extensive knowledge, while fitted models are often hard to scale. To address such
modeling burdens, we propose a learning-based, data-driven scenario forecasts method based on
generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is a class of deep-learning generative algorithms
used for modeling unknown distributions. We firstly utilize an improved GANs with convergence
guarantees to learn the intrinsic patterns and model the unknown distributions of (multiple-site)
renewable generation time-series. Then by solving an optimization problem, we are able to generate
forecasted scenarios without any scenario number and forecasting horizon restrictions. Our method
is totally model-free, and could forecast scenarios under different level of forecast uncertainties.
Extensive numerical simulations using real-world data from NREL wind and solar integration datasets
validate the performance of proposed method in forecasting both wind and solar power scenarios.
