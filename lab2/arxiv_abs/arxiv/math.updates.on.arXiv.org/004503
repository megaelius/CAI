Motivated by the fact that circular or spherical data are often much concentrated around a location
$\pmb\theta$, we consider inference about $\pmb\theta$ under "high concentration" asymptotic
scenarios for which the probability of any fixed spherical cap centered at $\pmb\theta$ converges
to one as the sample size $n$ diverges to infinity. Rather than restricting to Fisher-von Mises-Langevin
distributions, we consider a much broader, semiparametric, class of rotationally symmetric distributions
indexed by the location parameter $\pmb\theta$, a scalar concentration parameter $\kappa$ and
a functional nuisance $f$. We determine the class of distributions for which high concentration
is obtained as $\kappa$ diverges to infinity. For such distributions, we then consider inference
(point estimation, confidence zone estimation, hypothesis testing) on $\pmb\theta$ in asymptotic
scenarios where $\kappa_n$ diverges to infinity at an arbitrary rate with the sample size $n$. Our
asymptotic investigation reveals that, interestingly, optimal inference procedures on $\pmb\theta$
show consistency rates that depend on $f$. Using asymptotics "\`a la Le Cam", we show that the spherical
mean is, at any $f$, a parametrically super-efficient estimator of $\pmb\theta$ and that the Watson
and Wald tests for $\mathcal{H}_0:{\pmb\theta}={\pmb\theta}_0$ enjoy similar, non-standard,
optimality properties. We illustrate our results through simulations and treat a real data example.
On a technical point of view, our asymptotic derivations require challenging expansions of rotationally
symmetric functionals for large arguments of $f$.
