This paper is the first one in a series of three dealing with the concept of injective stabilization
of the tensor product and its applications. Its primary goal is to collect known facts and establish
a basic operational calculus that will be used in the subsequent parts. This is done in greater generality
than is necessary for the stated goal. Several results of independent interest are also established.
They include, among other things, connections with satellites, an explicit construction of the
stabilization of a finitely presented functor, various exactness properties of the injectively
stable functors, a construction, from a functor and a short exact sequence, of a doubly-infinite
exact sequence by splicing the injective stabilization of the functor and its derived functors.
When specialized to the tensor product functor with a finitely presented module, the injective
stabilization with coefficients in the ring is isomorphic to the 1-torsion functor. The Auslander-Reiten
formula is shown to be a special case of a more general duality formula, which holds for arbitrary
(i.e., not necessarily finite) modules over arbitrary associative rings with identity. A generalization
of a theorem of Eilenberg and Watts is proved. In the subsequent papers, applications of the developed
techniques are given. Part~II deals with new notions of torsion module and cotorsion module of a
module. This is done for arbitrary modules over arbitrary rings. Part~III introduces a new concept,
called the asymptotic stabilization of the tensor product. The result is closely related to different
variants of stable homology (these are generalizations of Tate homology to arbitrary rings). A
comparison theorem is proved.
