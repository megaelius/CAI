In 2003 Varadhan [V03] showed that both the quenched as well as an averaged distributions of the rescaled
location of a multidimensional random walk in a random environment satisfies large deviation principles.
Two fundamental questions remained open: First, can one characterize cases for which the quenched
and the averaged rate functions are equal, and for which they are not; and next, if the two rate functions
admit simpler expressions as explicit variational formulas. Partial answer to the first question
was given by Yilmaz [Y11] for the particular case of random walk in a random environment (RWRE) satisfying
a certain ballisticity criterion postulated by Sznitman [S01] known as condition-T, and for such
models it was shown that these two rate functions agree on some neighborhood of the non-zero limiting
velocity if dimension is at least four. In the present context, we consider a general set up of RWRE
dropping any such ballisticity assumptions, and show that for $d\geq 4$ and for {\it every} compact
subset $\mathcal K$ of the interior $int(\mathbb D)\setminus \{0\}$ of the $\ell^1$-unit ball,
the two rate functions of any RWRE in a uniformly elliptic and i.i.d. environment agree on $\mathcal
K$, if the underlying disorder of the environment remains sufficiently small. Similar results
are also shown to be true on {\it any} compact set of the boundary of the unit ball (not intersecting
its $(d-2)$-dimensional edges). As an application, we also provide an explicit Cram\'er-type
representation for the quenched rate function on the boundary, simplifying an earlier representation
found by Rosenbluth \cite{R06} considerably. Finally, for quite a general family of parametrized
random environments, we prove the existence of a non-trivial critical disorder parameter, such
that on the boundary, equality of these two rate functions prevails below and on this threshold,
and fails beyond it.
