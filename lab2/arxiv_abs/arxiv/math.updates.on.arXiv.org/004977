We study a class of weakly conformal $3$-harmonic maps, called associative Smith maps, from $3$-manifolds
into $7$-manifolds that parametrize associative $3$-folds in Riemannian $7$-manifolds equipped
with $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Associative Smith maps are solutions of a conformally invariant
nonlinear first order PDE system, called the Smith equation, that may be viewed as a $\mathrm{G}_2$-analogue
of the Cauchy-Riemann system for $J$-holomorphic curves. In this paper, we show that associative
Smith maps enjoy many of the same analytic properties as $J$-holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry.
In particular, we prove: (i) an interior regularity theorem, (ii) a removable singularity result,
(iii) an energy gap result, and (iv) a mean-value inequality. While our approach is informed by the
holomorphic curve case, a number of nontrivial extensions are involved, primarily due to the degeneracy
of the Smith equation. At the heart of above results is an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem that
gives quantitative $C^{1,\beta}$-regularity of $W^{1,3}$ associative Smith maps under a smallness
assumption on the $3$-energy. The proof combines previous work on weakly $3$-harmonic maps and
the observation that the associative Smith equation demonstrate a certain "compensation phenomenon"
that shows up in many other geometric PDEs. Combining these analytical properties and the conformal
invariance of the Smith equation, we explain how sequences of associative Smith maps with bounded
$3$-energy may be conformally rescaled to yield bubble trees of such maps. When the $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure
is closed, we prove that both the $3$-energy and the homotopy are preserved in the bubble tree limit.
This result may be regarded as an associative analogue of Gromov's Compactness Theorem in symplectic
geometry.
