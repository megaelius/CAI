We present several versions of Regularized Combined Field Integral Equation (CFIER) formulations
for the solution of three dimensional frequency domain electromagnetic scattering problems with
Perfectly Electric Conducting (PEC) boundary conditions. Just as in the Combined Field Integral
Equations (CFIE), we seek the scattered fields in the form of a combined magnetic and electric dipole
layer potentials that involves a composition of the latter type of boundary layers with regularizing
operators. The regularizing operators are of two types: (1) modified versions of electric field
integral operators with complex wavenumbers, and (2) principal symbols of those operators in the
sense of pseudodifferential operators. We show that the boundary integral operators that enter
these CFIER formulations are Fredholm of the second kind, and invertible with bounded inverses
in the classical trace spaces of electromagnetic scattering problems. We present a spectral analysis
of CFIER operators with regularizing operators that have purely imaginary wavenumbers for spherical
geometries. Under certain assumptions on the coupling constants and the absolute values of the
imaginary wavenumbers of the regularizing operators, we show that the ensuing CFIER operators
are coercive for spherical geometries. These properties allow us to derive wavenumber explicit
bounds on the condition numbers of certain CFIER operators that have been proposed in the literature.
When regularizing operators with complex wavenumbers with non-zero real parts are used, we show
numerical evidence that those complex wavenumbers can be selected in a manner that leads to CFIER
formulations whose condition numbers can be bounded independently of frequency for spherical
geometries.
