While the Yoneda embedding and its generalizations have been studied extensively in the literature,
the so-called tensor embedding has only received little attention. In this paper, we study the tensor
embedding for closed symmetric monoidal categories and show how it is connected to the notion of
geometrically purity, which has recently been investigated in works of Enochs, Estrada, Gillespie,
and Odaba\c{s}{\i}. More precisely, for a Gro\-thendieck cosmos---that is, a bicomplete Grothendick
category $\mathcal{V}$ with a closed symmetric monoidal structure---we prove that the geometrically
pure exact category $(\mathcal{V},\mathscr{E}_\otimes)$ has enough relative injectives; in
fact, every object has a geometrically pure injective envelope. We also show that for some regular
cardinal $\lambda$, the tensor embedding yields an exact equivalence between $(\mathcal{V},\mathscr{E}_\otimes)$
and the category of $\lambda$-cocontinuous $\mathcal{V}$-functors from $\mbox{Pres}(\mathcal{V})$
to $\mathcal{V}$, where the former is the full $\mathcal{V}$-subcategory of $\lambda$-presentable
objects in $\mathcal{V}$. In many cases of interest, $\lambda$ can be chosen to be $\aleph_0$ and
the tensor embedding identifies the geometrically pure injective objects in $\mathcal{V}$ with
the (categorically) injective objects in the abelian category of $\mathcal{V}$-functors from
$\mathrm{fp}(\mathcal{V})$ to $\mathcal{V}$. As we explain, the developed theory applies e.g.~to
the category $\mathsf{Ch}(R)$ of chain complexes of modules over a commutative ring $R$ and to the
category $\mathsf{Qcoh}(X)$ of quasi-coherent sheaves over a (suitably nice) scheme $X$.
