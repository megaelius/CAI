The authors of [BKR] studied the derived scheme DRep_n(A) of the classical representation scheme
Rep_n(A) for an associative k-algebra A. One of the key results of [BKR] is the construction of canonical
trace maps Tr_n(A): HC(A) -> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL extending the usual characters to higher cyclic
homology. These trace maps define a homomorphism of graded commutative algebras Sym[Tr_n(A)]:
Sym[HC(A)] -> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL. Given a well-known theorem of Procesi, it is natural to ask whether
Sym[Tr_n(A)] is surjective . The present paper studies this question for augmented algebras. We
construct a canonical dense DG subalgebra DRep_\infty(A)^Tr of the commutative DG algebra DRep_\infty(A)^{GL_\infty}.
It turns out that DRep_\infty(A)^Tr is a commutative cocommutative DG Hopf algebra. Our main result
shows that on passing to the inverse limit (as n -> \infty), the family of maps Sym[Tr_n(A)] "converges"
to an isomorphism of graded Hopf algebras Sym[\bar{HC}(A)] = H[DRep_\infty(A)^Tr]. The derived
version of Procesi's theorem is therefore, true in the limit. However, for a fixed (finite) n, we
obtain homological obstructions to the surjectivity of Sym[Tr_n(A)] that do not vanish in general.
Comparing our main result to the well-known theorem of Loday-Quillen and Tsygan, we show that the
relative Chevalley-Eilenberg coalgebra C(gl_\infty(A), gl_\infty(k); k) is Koszul dual to the
DG algebra DRep_\infty(A)^Tr. If A is a bigraded DG algebra, we prove that DRep_{\infty}(A)^Tr
= DRep_{\infty}(A)^GL_{\infty}. As an application, we compute the (bigraded) Euler characteristics
of DRep_\infty(A)^GL_{\infty} and \bar{HC}(A) and deduce some interesting combinatorial identities.
