The paper discusses the construction of high dimensional spatial discretizations for arbitrary
multivariate trigonometric polynomials, where the frequency support of the trigonometric polynomial
is known. We suggest a construction based on the union of several rank-1 lattices as sampling scheme
and call such schemes multiple rank-1 lattices. This approach automatically makes available a
fast discrete Fourier transform (FFT) on the data. The key objective of the construction of spatial
discretizations is the unique reconstruction of the trigonometric polynomial using the sampling
values at the sampling nodes. We develop construction methods for multiple rank-1 lattices that
allow for this unique reconstruction and for estimates of the number $M$ of distinct sampling nodes
within the resulting spatial discretizations. Assuming that the multivariate trigonometric
polynomial under consideration is a linear combination of $T$ trigonometric monomials, the oversampling
factor $M/T$ is independent of the spatial dimension and, roughly speaking, with high probability
only logarithmic in $T$, which is much better than the oversampling factor that is expected when
using one single rank-1 lattice. The newly developed approaches for the construction of spatial
discretizations are probabilistic methods. The arithmetic complexity of these algorithms depend
only linearly on the spatial dimension and, with high probability, only linearly on $T$ up to some
logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexities of the resulting
FFT algorithms in detail and obtain upper bounds in $\mathcal{O}\left(M\log M\right)$, where
the constants depend only linearly on the spatial dimension. With high probability, we construct
spatial discretizations where $M/T\le C\log T$ holds, which implies that the complexity of the
corresponding FFT converts to $\mathcal{O}\left(T\log^2 T\right)$.
