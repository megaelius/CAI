A novel type of functions called biregular irreducible functions is introduced and applied as security
components (instead of, e.g., universal hash functions) in seeded modular wiretap coding schemes,
whose second component is an error-correcting code. These schemes are called modular BRI schemes.
An upper bound on the semantic security information leakage of modular BRI schemes in a one-shot
setting is derived which separates the effects of the biregular irreducible function on the one
hand and the error-correcting code plus the channel on the other hand. The effect of the biregular
irreducible function is described by the second-largest eigenvalue of an associated stochastic
matrix. A characterization of biregular irreducible functions is given in terms of connected edge-disjoint
biregular graphs. It allows for the construction of new biregular irreducible functions from families
of edge-disjoint Ramanujan graphs, which are shown to exist. A frequently used arithmetic universal
hash function can be converted into a biregular irreducible function for certain parameters. Sequences
of Ramanujan biregular irreducible functions are constructed which exhibit an optimal trade-off
between the size of the regularity set and the rate of decrease of the associated second-largest
eigenvalue. Together with the one-shot bound on the information leakage, the existence of these
sequences implies an asymptotic coding result for modular BRI schemes applied to discrete and Gaussian
wiretap channels. It shows that the separation of error correction and security as done in a modular
BRI scheme is secrecy capacity-achieving for discrete and Gaussian wiretap channels. The same
holds for a derived construction where the seed is generated locally by the sender and reused several
times. Finally, optimal sequences of biregular irreducible functions used in the above constructions
must be nearly Ramanujan.
