We consider multi-armed bandit problems in social groups wherein each individual has bounded memory
and shares the common goal of learning the best arm/option. We say an individual learns the best option
if eventually (as $t\to \infty$) it pulls only the arm with the highest expected reward. While this
goal is provably impossible for an isolated individual due to bounded memory, we show that, in social
groups, this goal can be achieved easily with the aid of social persuasion (i.e., communication)
as long as the communication networks/graphs satisfy some mild conditions. To deal with the interplay
between the randomness in the rewards and in the social interaction, we employ the {\em mean-field
approximation} method. Considering the possibility that the individuals in the networks may not
be exchangeable when the communication networks are not cliques, we go beyond the classic mean-field
techniques and apply a refined version of mean-field approximation: (1) Using coupling we show
that, if the communication graph is connected and is either regular or has doubly-stochastic degree-weighted
adjacency matrix, with probability $\to 1$ as the social group size $N \to \infty$, every individual
in the social group learns the best option. (2) If the minimum degree of the graph diverges as $N \to
\infty$, over an arbitrary but given finite time horizon, the sample paths describing the opinion
evolutions of the individuals are asymptotically independent. In addition, the proportions of
the population with different opinions converge to the unique solution of a system of ODEs. In the
solution of the obtained ODEs, the proportion of the population holding the correct opinion converges
to $1$ exponentially fast in time. Notably, our results hold even if the communication graphs are
highly sparse.
