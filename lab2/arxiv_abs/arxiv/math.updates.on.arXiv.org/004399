The classical Gray and Wyner source coding for a simple network for sources that generate a tuple
of multivariate, correlated Gaussian random variables $(Y_1,Y_2)$ is re-examined using the geometric
approach of Gaussian random variables, and the weak stochastic realization of correlated Gaussian
random variables. New results are: (1) The formulation, methods and algorithms to parametrize
all random variables $W : \Omega \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n $ which make the two components of the
tuple $(Y_1,Y_2)$ conditionally independent, according to the weak stochastic realization of
$(Y_1, Y_2)$. (2) The transformation of random variables $(Y_1,Y_2)$ via non-singular transformations
$(S_1,S_2)$, into their canonical variable form. (3) A formula for Wyner's lossy common information
for joint decoding with mean-square error distortions. (4) The methods are shown to be of fundamental
importance to the parametrization of the lossy rate region of the Gray and Wyner source coding problem,
and the calculation of the smallest common message rate $R_0$ on the Gray and Wyner source problem,
when the sum rate $R_0+R_1+R_2$ is arbitrary close to the joint rate distortion function $R_{Y_1,
Y_2}(\Delta_1, \Delta_2)$ of joint decoding. The methods and algorithms may be applicable to other
problems of multi-user communication, such as, the multiple access channel, etc. The discussion
is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of weak stochastic
realization theory of multivariate correlated Gaussian random variables are reviewed, while
certain results are developed to meet the requirement of results (1)-(4).
