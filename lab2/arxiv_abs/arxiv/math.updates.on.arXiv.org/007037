In this paper the local iterative Lie-Schwinger block-diagonalization method, introduced in
[FP], [DFPR1], and [DFPR2] for quantum chains, is extended to higher-dimensional quantum lattice
systems with Hamiltonians that can be written as the sum of an unperturbed gapped operator, consisting
of a sum of on-site terms, and a perturbation consisting of bounded interaction potentials of short
range mutltiplied by a real coupling constant t. Our goal is to prove that the spectral gap above the
ground-state energy of such Hamiltonians persists for sufficiently small values of |t|, independently
of the size of the lattice. New ideas and concepts are necessary to extend our method to systems in
dimension d > 1: As in our earlier work, a sequence of local block-diagonalization steps based on
judiciously chosen unitary conjugations of the original Hamiltonian is introduced. The supports
of effective interaction potentials generated in the course of these block-diagonalization steps
can be identified with what we call minimal rectangles contained in the lattice, a concept that serves
to tackle combinatorial problems that arise in the course of iterating the block-diagonalization
steps. For a given minimal rectangle, control of the effective interaction potentials generated
in each block-diagonalization step with support in the given rectangle is achieved by exploiting
a variety of rather subtle mechanisms which include, for example, the use of weighted sums of paths
consisting of overlapping rectangles and of large denominators, expressed in terms of sums of orthogonal
projections, that serve to control analogous sums of projections in the numerators resulting from
the unitary conjugations of the interaction potential terms involved in the local block-diagonalization
step.
