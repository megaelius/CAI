We propose a variational regularisation approach for the problem of template-based image reconstruction
from indirect, noisy measurements as given, for instance, in X-ray computed tomography. An image
is reconstructed from such measurements by deforming a given template image. The image registration
is directly incorporated into the variational regularisation approach in the form of a partial
differential equation that models the registration as either mass- or intensity-preserving transport
from the template to the unknown reconstruction. We provide theoretical results for the proposed
variational regularisation for both cases. In particular, we prove existence of a minimiser, stability
with respect to the data, and convergence for vanishing noise when either of the abovementioned
equations is imposed and more general distance functions are used. Numerically, we solve the problem
by extending existing Lagrangian methods and propose a multilevel approach that is applicable
whenever a suitable downsampling procedure for the operator and the measured data can be provided.
Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our method for template-based image reconstruction
from highly undersampled and noisy Radon transform data. We compare results for mass- and intensity-preserving
image registration, various regularisation functionals, and different distance functions.
Our results show that very reasonable reconstructions can be obtained when only few measurements
are available and demonstrate that the use of a normalised cross correlation-based distance is
advantageous when the image intensities between the template and the unknown image differ substantially.
