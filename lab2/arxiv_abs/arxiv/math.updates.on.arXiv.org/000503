This work concerns integrable geometries and gauge theories in dimensions 1 to 4 related to twistor
theory. In each such dimension, there is a nondegenerate integrable geometric structure, governed
by a nonlinear integrable differential equation, each solution yielding a background geometry
on which, for any Lie group G, an integrable gauge theory is defined. In 4 dimensions, the geometry
is selfdual conformal geometry and the gauge theory is selfdual Yang-Mills theory, while the lower
dimensional structures are nondegenerate reductions. Any solution of the gauge theory on a k-dimensional
geometry, such that the gauge group H acts transitively on an l-manifold, determines a (k+l)-dimensional
geometry fibering over the k-dimensional geometry with H as a structure group. In the case of an l-dimensional
group H acting regularly on itself, all (k+l)-dimensional geometries with symmetry group H are
locally obtained. This framework unifies and extends known results about dimensional reductions
of selfdual conformal geometry and the selfdual Yang-Mills equation, and provides a rich supply
of constructive methods. In dimension 1, generalized Nahm equations provide a uniform description
of four pole isomonodromic deformation problems, and may be related to the SU(infinity) Toda and
dKP equations via a hodograph transformation. In dimension 2, the Diff(S1) Hitchin equation is
equivalent to the hyperCR Einstein-Weyl equation, while the SDiff(2) Hitchin equation leads to
a euclidean analogue of Plebanski's heavenly equations. In dimensions 3 and 4, the constructions
of this paper help to organize examples of Einstein-Weyl and selfdual spaces in the literature,
as well as providing some new ones. The nondegenerate reductions have a long ancestry. More recently,
degenerate or null reductions have attracted increased interest. Two of these reductions and their
gauge theories are also described.
