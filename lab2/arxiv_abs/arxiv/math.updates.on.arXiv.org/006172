Honest signals and cues have been observed as part of interspecific and intraspecific communication
among animals. Recent theories suggest that existing signaling systems have evolved through natural
selection imposed by predators. Honest signaling in the interspecific communication can provide
insight into the evolution of anti-predation techniques. In this work, we introduce a deterministic
three-stage, two-species predator-prey model, which modulates the impact of honest signals and
cues on the interacting populations. The model is built from a set of first principles originated
from signaling and social learning theory in which the response of predators to transmitted honest
signals or cues is determined. The predators then use the signals to decide whether to pursue the
attack or save their energy for an easier catch. Other members from the prey population that are not
familiar with signaling their fitness observe and learn the technique. Our numerical bifurcation
analysis indicates that increasing the predator's search rate and the corresponding assimilation
efficiency gives a journey from predator-prey abundance and scarcity, a stable transient cycle
between persistence and near-extinction, a homoclinic orbit pointing towards extinction, and
ultimately, a quasi-periodic orbit. A similar discovery is met under the increment of the prey's
intrinsic birth rate and carrying capacity. When both parameters are of sufficiently large magnitudes,
the separator between honest signal and cue takes the similar journey from a stable equilibrium
to a quasi-periodic orbit as it increases. In the context of modeling, we conclude that under prey
abundance, transmitting error-free honest signals leads to not only a stable but also more predictable
predator-prey dynamics.
