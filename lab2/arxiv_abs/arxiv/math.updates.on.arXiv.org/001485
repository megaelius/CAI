In this investigation we use a simple model of the dynamics of an inviscid vortex sheet given by the
Birkhoff-Rott equation to obtain fundamental insights about the potential for stabilization
of shear layers using feedback. First, we demonstrate using analytical computations that the Birkhoff-Rott
equation linearized around the flat-sheet configuration is in fact controllable when a pair of
point vortices located on both sides of the sheet is used as actuation. On the other hand, this system
is not controllable when the actuation has the form of a pair of sinks/sources with zero net mass flux.
Next we design a state-based LQR stabilization strategy where the key difficulty is the numerical
solution of the Riccati equation in the presence of severe ill-conditioning resulting from the
properties of the Birkhoff-Rott equation and the chosen form of actuation, an issue which is overcome
by performing computations with a suitably increased arithmetic precision. Analysis of the linear
closed-loop system reveals a range of different behaviors varying from a purely exponential decay
of the perturbation energy to its significant transient growth as the number of actuators is reduced.
Computations performed for the nonlinear closed-loop system demonstrate that initial perturbations
of nonnegligible amplitude can be effectively stabilized when a sufficient number of actuators
is used in an aligned arrangement. We also thoroughly analyze the sensitivity of the closed-loop
stabilization strategies to the variation of a number of key parameters. Subject to the known limitations
of inviscid vortex models, our findings indicate that, in principle, it may be possible to stabilize
shear layers, provided the actuation has sufficiently many degrees of freedom and the initial perturbations
are not too large.
