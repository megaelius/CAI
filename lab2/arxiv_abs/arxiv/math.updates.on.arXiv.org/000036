We set the context for capital approximation within the framework of the Basel II / III regulatory
capital accords. This is particularly topical as the Basel III accord is shortly due to take effect.
In this regard, we provide a summary of the role of capital adequacy in the new accord, highlighting
along the way the significant loss events that have been attributed to the Operational Risk class
that was introduced in the Basel II and III accords. Then we provide a semi-tutorial discussion on
the modelling aspects of capital estimation under a Loss Distributional Approach (LDA). Our emphasis
is to focus on the important loss processes with regard to those that contribute most to capital,
the so called high consequence, low frequency loss processes. This leads us to provide a tutorial
overview of heavy tailed loss process modelling in OpRisk under Basel III, with discussion on the
implications of such tail assumptions for the severity model in an LDA structure. This provides
practitioners with a clear understanding of the features that they may wish to consider when developing
OpRisk severity models in practice. From this discussion on heavy tailed severity models, we then
develop an understanding of the impact such models have on the right tail asymptotics of the compound
loss process and we provide detailed presentation of what are known as first and second order tail
approximations for the resulting heavy tailed loss process. From this we develop a tutorial on three
key families of risk measures and their equivalent second order asymptotic approximations: Value-at-Risk
(Basel III industry standard); Expected Shortfall (ES) and the Spectral Risk Measure. These then
form the capital approximations.
