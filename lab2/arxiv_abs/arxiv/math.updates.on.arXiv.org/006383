This paper presents the first comprehensive tutorial on a promising research field located at the
frontier of two well-established domains: Neurosciences and wireless communications, motivated
by the ongoing efforts to define how the sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) will be. In particular,
this tutorial first provides a novel integrative approach that bridges the gap between these two,
seemingly disparate fields. Then, we present the state-of-the-art and key challenges of these
two topics. In particular, we propose a novel systematization that divides the contributions into
two groups, one focused on what neurosciences will offer to 6G in terms of new applications and systems
architecture (Neurosciences for Wireless), and the other focused on how wireless communication
theory and 6G systems can provide new ways to study the brain (Wireless for Neurosciences). For the
first group, we concretely explain how current scientific understanding of the brain would enable
new application for 6G within the context of a new type of service that we dub braintype communications
and that has more stringent requirements than human- and machine-type communication. In this regard,
we expose the key requirements of brain-type communication services and we discuss how future wireless
networks can be equipped to deal with such services. Meanwhile, for the second group, we thoroughly
explore modern communication system paradigms, including Internet of Bio-nano Things and chaosbased
communications, in addition to highlighting how complex systems tools can help bridging 6G and
neuroscience applications. Brain-controlled vehicles are then presented as our case study. All
in all, this tutorial is expected to provide a largely missing articulation between these two emerging
fields while delineating concrete ways to move forward in such an interdisciplinary endeavor.
