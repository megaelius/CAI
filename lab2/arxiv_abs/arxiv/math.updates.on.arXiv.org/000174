Experimental realizations of a 1D interface always exhibit a finite microscopic width $\xi>0$;
its influence is erased by thermal fluctuations at sufficiently high temperatures, but turns out
to be a crucial ingredient for the description of the interface fluctuations below a characteristic
temperature $T_c(\xi)$. Exploiting the exact mapping between the static 1D interface and a 1+1
Directed Polymer (DP) growing in a continuous space, we study analytically both the free-energy
and geometrical fluctuations of a DP, at finite temperature $T$, with a short-range elasticity
and submitted to a quenched random-bond Gaussian disorder of finite correlation length $\xi$.
We derive the exact `time'-evolution equations of the disorder free-energy $\bar{F}(t,y)$, its
derivative $\eta (t,y)$, and their respective two-point correlators $\bar{C}(t,y)$ and $\bar{R}(t,y)$.
We compute the exact solution of its linearized evolution $\bar{R}^{lin}(t,y)$, and we combine
its qualitative behavior and the asymptotic properties known for an uncorrelated disorder ($\xi=0$),
to construct a `toymodel' leading to a simple description of the DP. This model is characterized
by Brownian-like free-energy fluctuations, correlated at small $|y|<\xi$, of amplitude $\tilde{D}_{\infty}(T,\xi)$.
We present an extended scaling analysis of the roughness predicting $\tilde{D}_{\infty} \sim
1/T$ at high-temperatures and $\tilde{D}_{\infty} \sim 1/T_c(\xi)$ at low-temperatures. We
identify the connection between the temperature-induced crossover and the full replica-symmetry
breaking in previous Gaussian Variational Method computations. Finally we discuss the consequences
of the low-temperature regime for two experimental realizations of KPZ interfaces, namely the
static and quasistatic behavior of magnetic domain walls and the high-velocity steady-state dynamics
of interfaces in liquid crystals.
