We present a fluctuating boundary integral method (FBIM) for overdamped Brownian Dynamics (BD)
of two-dimensional periodic suspensions of rigid particles of complex shape immersed in a Stokes
fluid. We develop a novel approach for generating Brownian displacements that arise in response
to the thermal fluctuations in the fluid. Our approach relies on a first-kind boundary integral
formulation of a mobility problem in which a random surface velocity is prescribed on the particle
surface, with zero mean and covariance proportional to the Green's function for Stokes flow (Stokeslet).
This approach yields an algorithm that scales linearly in the number of particles for both deterministic
and stochastic dynamics, handles particles of complex shape, achieves high order of accuracy,
and can be generalized to three dimensions and other boundary conditions. We show that Brownian
displacements generated by our method obey the discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance relation
(DFDB). Based on a recently-developed Positively Split Ewald method [A. M. Fiore, F. Balboa Usabiaga,
A. Donev and J. W. Swan, J. Chem. Phys., 146, 124116, 2017], near-field contributions to the Brownian
displacements are efficiently approximated by iterative methods in real space, while far-field
contributions are rapidly generated by fast Fourier-space methods based on fluctuating hydrodynamics.
FBIM provides the key ingredient for time integration of the overdamped Langevin equations for
Brownian suspensions of rigid particles. We demonstrate that FBIM obeys DFDB by performing equilibrium
BD simulations of suspensions of starfish-shaped bodies using a random finite difference temporal
integrator.
