The thesis is dedicated to studying methods to improve the efficiency of random access schemes and
to facilitate their deployment in machine-type communications (MTC). First, a joint user activity
identification and channel estimation scheme is designed for grant-free random access systems.
We propose a decentralized transmission control and design a compressed sensing (CS)-based user
identification and channel estimation scheme. We analyze the packet delay and throughput of the
proposed scheme. We also optimize the transmission control scheme to maximize the system throughput.
Second, a random access scheme, i.e., the coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) scheme, is designed for erasure
channels to improve the system throughput. By deriving the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT)
functions and optimizing their convergence behavior, we design the code probability distributions
for CSA schemes with repetition codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes to maximize the
expected traffic load, under packet erasure and slot erasure channels. We derive the asymptotic
throughput of CSA schemes over the erasure channels for an infinite frame length, which is verified
to well approximate the throughput for a practical frame length. Third, an efficient data decoding
algorithm for the CSA scheme is proposed to further improve the system efficiency. We present a low-complexity
physical-layer network coding (PNC) method to obtain linear combinations of collided packets
and design an enhanced message-level successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm to
exploit the linear combinations of collided packets. We propose an analytical framework and derive
the system throughput for the proposed scheme. The CSA scheme is further optimized to maximize the
system throughput and energy efficiency.
