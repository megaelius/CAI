We consider a system of interacting Fisher-Wright diffusions with seed-bank. Individuals live
in colonies and are subject to resampling and migration as long as they are active. Each colony has
a structured seed-bank into which individuals can retreat to become dormant, suspending their
resampling and migration until they become active again. As geographic space labelling the colonies
we consider a countable Abelian group $\mathbb{G}$ endowed with the discrete topology. The key
example of interest is the Euclidean lattice $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our goal is to classify
the long-time behaviour of the system in terms of the underlying model parameters. In particular,
we want to understand in what way the seed-bank enhances genetic diversity. We introduce three models
of increasing generality, namely, individuals become dormant: (1) in the seed-bank of their colony;
(2) in the seed-bank of their colony while adopting a random colour that determines their wake-up
time; (3) in the seed-bank of a random colony while adopting a random colour. The extension in (2)
allows us to model wake-up times with fat tails while preserving the Markov property of the evolution.
For each of the three models we show that the system converges to a unique equilibrium depending on
a single density parameter that is determined by the initial state, and exhibits a dichotomy of coexistence
(= locally multi-type equilibrium) versus clustering (= locally mono-type equilibrium) depending
on the parameters controlling the migration and the seed-bank. The dichotomy between clustering
and coexistence in model 1 is determined by migration only. In models (2) and (3), when the wake-up
time has infinite mean, the dichotomy is determined by both the exchange with the seed-bank and migration.
It turns out that the seed-bank affects the long-time behaviour both quantitatively and qualitatively.
