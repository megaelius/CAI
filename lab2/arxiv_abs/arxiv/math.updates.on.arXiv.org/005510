Traditional time discretization methods use a single timestep for the entire system of interest
and can perform poorly when the dynamics of the system exhibits a wide range of time scales. Multirate
infinitesimal step (MIS) methods (Knoth and Wolke, 1998) offer an elegant and flexible approach
to efficiently integrate such systems. The slow components are discretized by a Runge-Kutta method,
and the fast components are resolved by solving modified fast differential equations. Sandu (2018)
developed the Multirate Infinitesimal General-structure Additive Runge-Kutta (MRI-GARK) family
of methods that includes traditional MIS schemes as a subset. The MRI-GARK framework allowed the
construction of the first fourth order MIS schemes. This framework also enabled the introduction
of implicit methods, which are decoupled in the sense that any implicitness lies entirely within
the fast or slow integrations. It was shown by Sandu that the stability of decoupled implicit MRI-GARK
methods has limitations when both the fast and slow components are stiff and interact strongly.
This work extends the MRI-GARK framework by introducing coupled implicit methods to solve stiff
multiscale systems. The coupled approach has the potential to considerably improve the overall
stability of the scheme, at the price of requiring implicit stage calculations over the entire system.
Two coupling strategies are considered. The first computes coupled Runge-Kutta stages before
solving a single differential equation to refine the fast solution. The second alternates between
computing coupled Runge-Kutta stages and solving fast differential equations. We derive order
conditions and perform the stability analysis for both strategies. The new coupled methods offer
improved stability compared to the decoupled MRI-GARK schemes. The theoretical properties of
the new methods are validated with numerical experiments.
