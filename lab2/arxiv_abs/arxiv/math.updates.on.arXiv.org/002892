Recent works have shown that an instance of a Brownian surface (such as the Brownian map or Brownian
disk) a.s. has a canonical conformal structure under which it is equivalent to a $\sqrt{8/3}$-Liouville
quantum gravity (LQG) surface. In particular, Brownian motion on a Brownian surface is well-defined.
The construction in these works is indirect, however, and leaves open a basic question: is Brownian
motion on a Brownian surface the limit of simple random walk on increasingly fine discretizations
of that surface, the way Brownian motion on $\mathbb R^2$ is the $\epsilon \to 0$ limit of simple random
walk on $\epsilon \mathbb Z^2$? We answer this question affirmatively by showing that Brownian
motion on a Brownian surface is (up to time change) the $\lambda \to \infty$ limit of simple random
walk on the Voronoi tessellation induced by a Poisson point process whose intensity is $\lambda$
times the associated area measure. Among other things, this implies that as $\lambda \to \infty$
the Tutte embedding (a.k.a. harmonic embedding) of the discretized Brownian disk converges to
the canonical conformal embedding of the continuum Brownian disk, which in turn corresponds to
$\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG. As a further consequence, we show that for any sequence of random planar maps
$\{M^n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ which converges to the Brownian disk, certain "coarse-grained" Tutte
embeddings of $M^n$ converge to $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG. Along the way, we obtain other independently
interesting facts about conformal embeddings of Brownian surfaces, including information about
the Euclidean shapes of embedded metric balls and Voronoi cells. For example, we derive moment estimates
that imply, in a certain precise sense, that these shapes are unlikely to be very long and thin.
