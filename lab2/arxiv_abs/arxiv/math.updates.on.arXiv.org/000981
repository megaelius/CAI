Among those transversally elliptic operators initiated by Atiyah and Singer, Kohn's $\Box_b$
operator on CR manifolds with $S^1$ action is a natural one of geometric significance for complex
analysts. Our first main result establishes an asymptotic expansion for the heat kernel of such
an operator with values in its Fourier components, which involves an unprecedented contribution
in terms of a distance function from lower dimensional strata of the $S^1$-action. Our second main
result computes a local index density, in terms of \emph{tangential} characteristic forms, on
such manifolds including \emph{Sasakian manifolds} of interest in String Theory, by showing that
certain non-trivial contributions from strata in the heat kernel expansion will eventually cancel
out by applying Getzler's rescaling technique to off-diagonal estimates. This leads to a local
result which can be thought of as a type of local index theorem on these CR manifolds. As applications
of our CR index theorem we can prove a CR version of Grauert-Riemenschneider criterion, and produce
many CR functions on a weakly pseudoconvex CR manifold with transversal $S^1$ action and many CR
sections on some class of CR manifolds, answering (on this class of manifolds) some long-standing
questions in several complex variables and CR geometry. We give examples of these CR manifolds,
some of which arise from Brieskorn manifolds. Moreover in some cases, without use of equivariant
cohomology method nor keeping contributions arising from lower dimensional strata as done in previous
works, we can reinterpret Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a complex orbifold
with an orbifold holomorphic line bundle, as an index theorem obtained by a single integral over
a smooth CR manifold which is essentially the circle bundle of this line bundle.
