Group-sparsity is a common low-complexity signal model with widespread application across various
domains of science and engineering. The recovery of such signal ensembles from compressive measurements
has been extensively studied in the literature under the assumption that measurement operators
are modeled as densely populated random matrices. In this paper, we turn our attention to an acquisition
model intended to ease the energy consumption of sensing devices by splitting the measurements
up into distinct signal blocks. More precisely, we present uniform guarantees for group-sparse
signal recovery in the scenario where a number of sensors obtain independent partial signal observations
modeled by block diagonal measurement matrices. We establish a group-sparse variant of the classical
restricted isometry property for block diagonal sensing matrices acting on group-sparse vectors,
and provide conditions under which subgaussian block diagonal random matrices satisfy this group-RIP
with high probability. Two different scenarios are considered in particular. In the first scenario,
we assume that each sensor is equipped with an independently drawn measurement matrix. We later
lift this requirement by considering measurement matrices with constant block diagonal entries.
In other words, every sensor is equipped with a copy of the same prototype matrix. The problem of establishing
the group-RIP is cast into a form in which one needs to establish the concentration behavior of the
suprema of chaos processes which involves estimating Talagrand's $\gamma_2$ functional. As a
side effect of the proof, we present an extension to Maurey's empirical method to provide new bounds
on the covering number of sets consisting of finite convex combinations of possibly infinite sets.
