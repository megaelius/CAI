The classical sharp threshold theorem of Friedgut and Kalai (1996) asserts that any symmetric monotone
function $f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\}$ exhibits a sharp threshold phenomenon. This means that the
expectation of $f$ with respect to the biased measure $\mu_{p}$ increases rapidly from 0 to 1 as $p$
increases. In this paper we present `robust' versions of the theorem, which assert that it holds
also if the function is `almost' monotone, and admits a much weaker notion of symmetry. Unlike the
original proof of the theorem which relies on hypercontractivity, our proof relies on a `regularity'
lemma (of the class of Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma and its generalizations) and on the `invariance
principle' of Mossel, O'Donnell, and Oleszkiewicz which allows (under certain conditions) replacing
functions on the cube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ with functions on Gaussian random variables. The hypergraph
removal lemma of Gowers (2007) and independently of Nagle, R\"odl, Schacht, and Skokan (2006) says
that if a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices contains few copies of a fixed hypergraph $H$, then
it can be made $H$-free by removing few of its edges. While this settles the `hypergraph removal problem'
in the case where $k$ and $H$ are fixed, the result is meaningless when $k$ is large (e.g. $k>\log\log\log
n$). Using our robust version of the Friedgut-Kalai Theorem, we obtain a hypergraph removal lemma
that holds for $k$ up to linear in $n$ for a large class of hypergraphs. These contain all the hypergraphs
such that both their number of edges and the sizes of the intersections of pairs of their edges are
upper bounded by some constant.
