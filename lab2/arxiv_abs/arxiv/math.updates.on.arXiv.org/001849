We propose hybrid methods for localization in wireless sensor networks fusing noisy range measurements
with angular information (extracted from video). Compared with conventional methods that rely
on a single sensed variable, this may pave the way for improved localization accuracy and robustness.
We address both the single-source and network (i.e., cooperative multiple-source) localization
paradigms, solving them via optimization of a convex surrogate. The formulations for hybrid localization
are unified in the sense that we propose a single nonlinear least-squares cost function, fusing
both angular and range measurements. We then relax the problem to obtain an estimate of the optimal
positions. This contrasts with other hybrid approaches that alternate the execution of localization
algorithms for each type of measurement separately, to progressively refine the position estimates.
Single-source localization uses a semidefinite relaxation to obtain a one-shot matrix solution
from which the source position is derived via factorization. Network localization uses a different
approach where sensor coordinates are retained as optimization variables, and the relaxed cost
function is efficiently minimized using fast iterations based on Nesterov's optimal method. Further,
an automated calibration procedure is developed to express range and angular information, obtained
by different devices, possibly deployed at different locations, in a single consistent coordinate
system. This drastically reduces the need for manual calibration that would otherwise negatively
impact the practical usability of hybrid range/video localization systems. We develop and test,
both in simulation and experimentally, the new hybrid localization algorithms, which not only
overcome the limitations of previous fusing approaches but also compare favorably to state-of-the-art
methods, outperforming them in some scenarios.
