Markovian master equations are a ubiquitous tool in the study of open quantum systems, but deriving
them from first principles involves a series of compromises. On the one hand, the Redfield equation
is valid for fast environments (whose correlation function decays much faster than the system relaxation
time) regardless of the relative strength of the coupling to the system Hamiltonian, but is notoriously
non-completely-positive. On the other hand, the Davies equation preserves complete positivity
but is valid only in the ultra-weak coupling limit and for systems with a finite level spacing, which
makes it incompatible with arbitrarily fast time-dependent driving. Here we show that a recently
derived Markovian coarse-grained master equation (CGME), already known to be completely positive,
has a much expanded range of applicability compared to the Davies equation, and moreover, is locally
generated and can be generalized to accommodate arbitrarily fast driving. This generalization,
which we refer to as the time-dependent CGME, is thus suitable for the analysis of fast operations
in gate-model quantum computing, such as quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling. Our
derivation proceeds directly from the Redfield equation and allows us to place rigorous error bounds
on all three equations: Redfield, Davies, and coarse-grained. Our main result is thus a completely
positive Markovian master equation that is a controlled approximation to the true evolution for
any time-dependence of the system Hamiltonian, and works for systems with arbitrarily small level
spacing. We illustrate this with an analysis showing that dynamical decoupling can extend coherence
times even in a strictly Markovian setting.
