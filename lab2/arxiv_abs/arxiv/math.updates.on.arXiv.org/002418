This book provides the analytic solution of a fundamental open problem in control theory. It provides
the general analytic criterion to obtain the state observability of nonlinear systems in presence
of multiple unknown inputs. This problem, called the Unknown Input Observability problem, was
introduced in the seventies. The analytic criterion is simple and can be easily and automatically
applied to nonlinear systems driven by both known and unknown inputs, independently of their complexity
and type of nonlinearity. Very surprisingly, the complexity of the overall analytic criterion
is comparable to the complexity of the standard method to check the state observability in the case
without unknown inputs (i.e., the observability rank condition). Given any nonlinear system characterized
by any type of nonlinearity, driven by both known and unknown inputs, the state observability is
obtained by following a simple systematic procedure (e.g., by the usage of a very simple code that
uses symbolic computation). This is a fundamental practical (and unexpected) advantage. On the
other hand, the analytic derivations and all the proofs necessary to analytically derive the algorithm
and its convergence properties and to prove their general validity are very complex and they are
extensively based on an ingenious analogy with the theory of General Relativity. In practice, these
derivations largely use Ricci calculus with tensors. The analytic criterion is illustrated by
checking the observability of several nonlinear systems ranging from planar robotics up to advanced
nonlinear systems. In particular, the last applications are in the framework of visual-inertial
sensor fusion. For this problem, the application of the analytic criterion provides a remarkable
and amazing result, which could have relevance on the problem of visual-vestibular integration
for self-motion perception in neuroscience.
