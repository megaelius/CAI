In this paper, we propose a dynamical model to describe the transmission of COVID-19, which is spreading
in China and many other countries. To avoid a larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government
carried out a series of strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine
is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to estimate the effect of population
quarantine, we divide the population into seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares
procedure and officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model is
given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the transmission of COVID-19
accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend of the disease is given. The home quarantine
strategy plays an important role in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of
COVID-19. The control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and discussed
adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is in decline in China, the disease
still has high risk of human-to-human transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is
removed, COVID-19 may become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease
is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the virus and the meteorological
conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological
factors on both high and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail
vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the effectiveness of
efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes into use, the numerical simulation provide a promptly
prospective research.
