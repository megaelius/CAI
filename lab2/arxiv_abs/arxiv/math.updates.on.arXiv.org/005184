The concept of Riemann-Stieltjes integral $\int_a^b {f\left( t \right)du\left( t \right)}$;
where $f$ is called the integrand, $u$ is called the integrator, plays an important role in Mathematics.
The approximation problem of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral $\int_a^b {f\left( t \right)du\left(
t \right)}$ in terms of the Riemann-Stieltjes sums have been considered recently by many authors.
However, a small attention and a few works have been considered for mappings of two variables; i.e.,
The approximation problem of the Riemann-Stieltjes double integral $\int_a^b {\int_c^d {f\left(
{t,s} \right)d_s d_t u\left( {t,s} \right)} }$ in terms of the Riemann-Stieltjes double sums. This
study is devoted to obtain several bounds for $\int_a^b {\int_c^d {f\left( {t,s} \right)d_s d_t
u\left( {t,s} \right)} }$ under various assumptions on the integrand $f$ and the integrator $u$.
Mainly, the concepts of bounded variation and bi-variation are used at large in the thesis. Several
proposed cubature formula are introduced to approximate such double integrals. For mappings of
two variables several inequalities of Trapezoid, Gr\"{u}ss and Ostrowski type for mappings of
bounded variation, bounded bi-variation, Lipschitzian and monotonic are introduced and discussed.
Namely, Trapezoid-type rules for $\mathcal{RS}$-Double integrals are proved, and therefore
the classical Hermite-Hadamard inequality for mappings of two variables is established. A Korkine
type identity is used to obtain several Gr\"{u}ss type inequalities for integrable functions.
Finally, approximating real functions of two variables which possess $n$-th partial derivatives
of bounded bi-variation, Lipschitzian and absolutely continuous are established and investigated.
