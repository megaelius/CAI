Two tantalizing invariants of a combinatorial code $\mathcal C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ are $\text{cdim}(\mathcal
C)$ and $\text{odim}(\mathcal C)$, the smallest dimension in which $\mathcal C$ can be realized
by convex closed or open sets, respectively. We study the behavior of these invariants for intersection
complete codes. Cruz, Giusti, Itskov, and Kronholm showed that for intersection complete codes
$\mathcal C$ with $m+1$ maximal codewords, $\text{odim}(\mathcal C)$ and $\text{cdim}(\mathcal
C)$ are both bounded above by $\max\{2,m\}$. Results of Lienkaemper, Shiu, and Woodstock imply
that $\text{odim}$ and $\text{cdim}$ may differ, even for intersection complete codes. We add
to this line of work with the following results. If $\mathcal C$ is a simplicial complex, then $\text{cdim}(\mathcal
C) = \text{odim}(\mathcal C)$. If $\mathcal C$ is intersection complete, then $\text{cdim}(\mathcal
C)\le \text{odim}(\mathcal C)$. If $\mathcal C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is intersection complete and
$d = \dim(\Delta(\mathcal C))$, then $\text{cdim}(\mathcal C) \le \min \{2d+1, n-1\}$. Lastly,
for each simplicial complex $\Delta\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with $m\ge 2$ facets, there exists an intersection
complete code $\mathcal S_\Delta\subseteq 2^{[n+1]}$ with $m+1$ maximal codewords and $\text{odim}(\mathcal
S_\Delta)=m$. In particular, for each $n\ge 3$ there exists an intersection complete code $\mathcal
C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with $\text{odim}(\mathcal C) = \binom{n-1}{\lfloor (n-1)/2\rfloor}$.
A key tool in our work is the study of sunflowers: arrangements of convex open sets in which the sets
simultaneously meet in a central region, and nowhere else. We use Tverberg's theorem to study the
structure of "$k$-flexible" sunflowers, and consequently obtain new lower bounds on $\text{odim}(\mathcal
C)$ for intersection complete codes $\mathcal C$.
