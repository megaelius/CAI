We construct spherical vector bases that are bandlimited and spatially concentrated, or, alternatively,
spacelimited and spectrally concentrated, suitable for the analysis and representation of real-valued
vector fields on the surface of the unit sphere, as arises in the natural and biomedical sciences,
and engineering. Building on the original approach of Slepian, Landau, and Pollak we concentrate
the energy of our function bases into arbitrarily shaped regions of interest on the sphere, and within
certain bandlimits in the vector spherical-harmonic domain. As with the concentration problem
for scalar functions on the sphere, which has been treated in detail elsewhere, a Slepian vector
basis can be constructed by solving a finite-dimensional algebraic eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue
problem decouples into separate problems for the radial and tangential components. For regions
with advanced symmetry such as polar caps, the spectral concentration kernel matrix is very easily
calculated and block-diagonal, lending itself to efficient diagonalization. The number of spatiospectrally
well-concentrated vector fields is well estimated by a Shannon number that only depends on the area
of the target region and the maximal spherical-harmonic degree or bandwidth. The spherical Slepian
vector basis is doubly orthogonal, both over the entire sphere and over the geographic target region.
Like its scalar counterparts it should be a powerful tool in the inversion, approximation and extension
of bandlimited fields on the sphere: vector fields such as gravity and magnetism in the earth and
planetary sciences, or electromagnetic fields in optics, antenna theory and medical imaging.
