We consider the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation with a Burgers-type convective term that is used as
a model of coarsening dynamics in driven phase-separating systems. In the absence of driving, it
is known that solutions to the standard CH equation are characterized by an initial stage of phase
separation into regions of one phase surrounded by the other phase (i.e., clusters or droplets/holes
or islands are obtained) followed by the coarsening process, where the average size of the clusters
grows in time and the number of the clusters decreases. Moreover, two main coarsening modes have
been identified in the literature, namely, coarsening due to volume transfer and due to translation.
In the opposite limit of strong driving, the well-known Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation is
recovered, which may produce complicated chaotic spatio-temporal oscillations. The primary
aim of the present work is to perform a detailed and systematic investigation of the transitions
in the solutions of the convective CH (cCH) equation for a wide range of parameter values as the driving-force
parameter is increased, and, in particular, to understand in detail how the coarsening dynamics
is affected by driving. We find that one of the coarsening modes is stabilized at relatively weak
driving, and the type of the unstable coarsening mode may change as driving increases. In addition,
we find that there may be intervals in the driving-force parameter where coarsening is completely
stabilized. On the other hand, there may be intervals where two-mode solutions are unstable and
the solutions can evolve, for example, into one-droplet/hole solutions, symmetry-broken two-droplet/hole
solutions or time-periodic solutions. We present detailed stability diagrams for two-mode solutions
in the parameter planes and corroborate our findings by time-dependent simulations.
