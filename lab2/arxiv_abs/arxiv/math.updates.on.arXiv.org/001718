It was at the dawn of the historical developments of quantum mechanics when Schr\"odinger, Kennard
and Darwin proposed an interesting type of Gaussian wave packets, which do not spread out while evolving
in time. Originally, these wave packets are the prototypes of the renowned discovery, which are
familiar as coherent states today. Coherent states are inevitable in the study of almost all areas
of modern science, and the rate of progress of the subject is astonishing nowadays. Nonclassical
states constitute one of the distinguished branches of coherent states having applications in
various subjects including quantum information processing, quantum optics, quantum superselection
principles and mathematical physics. On the other hand, the compelling advancements of non-Hermitian
systems and related areas have been appealing, which became popular with the seminal paper by Bender
and Boettcher in 1998. The subject of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems possessing real eigenvalues
are exploding day by day and combining with almost all other subjects rapidly, in particular, in
the areas of quantum optics, lasers and condensed matter systems, where one finds ample successful
experiments for the proposed theory. For this reason, the study of coherent states for non-Hermitian
systems have been very important. In this article, we review the recent developments of coherent
and nonclassical states for such systems and discuss their applications and usefulness in different
contexts of physics. In addition, since the systems considered here originate from the broader
context of the study of minimal uncertainty relations, our review is also of interest to the mathematical
physics community.
