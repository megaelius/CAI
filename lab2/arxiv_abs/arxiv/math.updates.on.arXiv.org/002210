We consider the problem of approximating an analytic function on a compact interval from its values
at $M+1$ distinct points. When the points are equispaced, a recent result (the so-called impossibility
theorem) has shown that the best possible convergence rate of a stable method is root-exponential
in $M$, and that any method with faster exponential convergence must also be exponentially ill-conditioned
at a certain rate. This result hinges on a classical theorem of Coppersmith & Rivlin concerning the
maximal behaviour of polynomials bounded on an equispaced grid. In this paper, we first generalize
this theorem to arbitrary point distributions. We then present an extension of the impossibility
theorem valid for general nonequispaced points, and apply it to the case of points that are equidistributed
with respect to (modified) Jacobi weight functions. This leads to a necessary sampling rate for
stable approximation from such points. We prove that this rate is also sufficient, and therefore
exactly quantify (up to constants) the precise sampling rate for approximating analytic functions
from such node distributions with stable methods. Numerical results -- based on computing the maximal
polynomial via a variant of the classical Remez algorithm -- confirm our main theorems. Finally,
we discuss the implications of our results for polynomial least-squares approximations. In particular,
we theoretically confirm the well-known heuristic that stable least-squares approximation using
polynomials of degree $N < M$ is possible only once $M$ is sufficiently large for there to be a subset
of $N$ of the nodes that mimic the behaviour of the $N$th set of Chebyshev nodes.
