The study of higher order energy functionals was first proposed by Eells and Sampson in 1965 and,
later, by Eells and Lemaire in 1983. These functionals provide a natural generalization of the classical
energy functional. More precisely, Eells and Sampson suggested the investigation of the so-called
$ES-r$-energy functionals $ E_r^{ES}(\varphi)=(1/2)\int_{M}\,|(d^*+d)^r (\varphi)|^2\,dV$,
where $ \varphi:M \to N$ is a map between two Riemannian manifolds. In the initial part of this paper
we shall clarify some relevant issues about the definition of an $ES-r$-harmonic map, i.e, a critical
point of $ E_r^{ES}(\varphi)$. That seems important to us because in the literature other higher
order energy functionals have been studied by several authors and consequently some recent examples
need to be discussed and extended: this shall be done in the first two sections of this work, where
we obtain the first examples of proper critical points of $E_r^{ES}(\varphi)$ when $N={\mathbb
S}^m$ $(r \geq4,\, m\geq3)$, and we also prove some general facts which should be useful for future
developments of this subject. Next, we shall compute the Euler-Lagrange system of equations for
$E_r^{ES}(\varphi)$ for $r=4$. We shall apply this result to the study of maps into space forms and
to rotationally symmetric maps: in particular, we shall focus on the study of various family of conformal
maps. In Section 4, we shall also show that, even if $2 r > \dim M$, the functionals $ E_r^{ES}(\varphi)$
may not satisfy the classical Palais-Smale Condition (C). In the final part of the paper we shall
study the second variation and compute index and nullity of some significant examples.
