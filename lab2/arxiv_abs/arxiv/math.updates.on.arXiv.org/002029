A standard approach to reduce the complexity of very large networks is to group together sets of nodes
into clusters according to some criterion which reflects certain structural properties of the
network. Beyond the well-known modularity measures defining communities, there are criteria
based on the existence of similar or identical connection patterns of a node or sets of nodes to the
remainder of the network. A key notion in this context is that of structurally equivalent or twin
nodes, displaying exactly the same connection pattern to the remainder of the network. The first
goal of this paper is to extend this idea to subgraphs of arbitrary order of a given network, by means
of the notions of T-twin and F-twin subgraphs. This is motivated by the need to provide a systematic
approach to the analysis of core-semiperiphery-periphery (CSP) structures, a notion which somehow
lacks a formal treatment in the literature. The goal is to provide an analytical framework accommodating
and extending the idea that the unique (ideal) core-periphery (CP) structure is a 2-partitioned
K2. We provide a formal definition of CSP structures in terms of core eccentricities and periphery
degrees, with semiperiphery vertices acting as intermediaries. The T-twin and F-twin notions
then make it possible to reduce the large number of resulting structures by identifying isomorphic
substructures which share the connection pattern to the remainder of the graph, paving the way for
the decomposition and enumeration of CSP structures. We compute the resulting CSP structures up
to order six. We illustrate the scope of our results by analyzing a subnetwork of the network of 1994
metal manufactures trade. Our approach can be further applied in complex network theory and seems
to have many potential extensions.
