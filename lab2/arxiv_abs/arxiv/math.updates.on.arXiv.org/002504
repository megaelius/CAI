In this paper, we study flows of hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space, and apply them to prove geometric
inequalities. In the first part of the paper, we consider volume preserving flows by a family of curvature
functions including positive powers of $k$-th mean curvatures with $k=1,\cdots,n$, and positive
powers of $p$-th power sums $S_p$ with $p>0$. We prove that if the initial hypersurface $M_0$ is smooth
and closed and has positive sectional curvatures, then the solution $M_t$ of the flow has positive
sectional curvature for any time $t>0$, exists for all time and converges to a geodesic sphere exponentially
in the smooth topology. The convergence result can be used to show that certain Alexandrov-Fenchel
quermassintegral inequalities, known previously for horospherically convex hypersurfaces,
also hold under the weaker condition of positive sectional curvature. In the second part of this
paper, we study curvature flows for strictly horospherically convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic
space with speed given by a smooth, symmetric, increasing and homogeneous degree one function $f$
of the shifted principal curvatures $\lambda_i=\kappa_i-1$, plus a global term chosen to impose
a constraint on the quermassintegrals of the enclosed domain, where $f$ is assumed to satisfy a certain
condition on the second derivatives. We prove that if the initial hypersurface is smooth, closed
and strictly horospherically convex, then the solution of the flow exists for all time and converges
to a geodesic sphere exponentially in the smooth topology. As applications of the convergence result,
we prove a new rigidity theorem on smooth closed Weingarten hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space,
and a new class of Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities for smooth horospherically convex hypersurfaces
in hyperbolic space.
