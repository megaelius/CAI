Following the previous two parts, of a work devoted to encode strong reaction dynamics in the A. Pr\'astaro's
algebraic topology of quantum super PDE's, nonlinear quantum propagators in the observed quantum
super Yang-Mills PDE, $\hat{(YM)}[i]$, are further characterized. In particular, nonlinear
quantum propagators with non-zero defect quantum electric-charge, are interpreted as {\em exotic-quantum
supergravity} effects. As an application, the recently discovered bound-state called $Zc(3900)$,
is obtained as a neutral quasi-particle, generated in a $Q$-quantum exotic supergravity process.
{\em Quantum entanglement} is justified by means of the algebraic topologic structure of nonlinear
quantum propagators. Quantum Cheshire cats are considered as examples of quantum entanglements.
Existence theorem for solutions of $\hat{(YM)}[i]$ admitting negative local temperatures ({\em
quantum thermodynamic-exotic solutions}) is obtained too and related to quantum entanglement.
Such exotic solutions are used to encode Universe at the Planck-epoch. It is proved that the Universe's
expansion at the Planck epoch is justified by the fact that it is encoded by a nonlinear quantum propagator
having thermodynamic quantum exotic components in its boundary. This effect produces also an increasing
of energy in the Universe at the Einstein epoch: {\em Planck-epoch-legacy} on the boundary of our
Universe. This is the main source of the Universe's expansion and solves the problem of the non-apparent
energy-matter ({\em dark-energy-matter}) in the actual Universe. Breit-Wheeler-type processes
have been proved in the framework of the Pr\'astaro's algebraic topology of quantum super Yang-Mills
PDEs. Numerical comparisons of nonlinear quantum propagators with Weinberg-Salam electroweak
theory in Standard Model are given.
