This Ph.D. thesis is devoted to the constructions of Lagrangian formulation on Finsler and Kawaguchi
manifolds. While Finsler geometry is a natural extension of Riemannian geometry, Kawaguchi geometry
is the extension of Finsler geometry to higher order derivatives and to k-dimensional parameter
space. The latter extension is also called areal geometry in some references. On Finsler (Kawaguchi)
manifold, we can define a reparameterisation invariant 1 (k)-dimensional area by the Hilbert (Kawaguchi)
form, which we take as an action. The equation of motion obtained from such action also has the property
of reparameterisation invariance. In this framework, the solution manifold of the Euler-Lagrange
equation is realised as a submanifold of Finsler/Kawaguchi manifold, and no fibered structure
over the parameter space is needed. We also show that for the case of first order k-dimensional parameter
space and second order 1-dimensional parameter space, a global Lagrangian could be constructed.
For second order k-dimensional parameter space, Lagrangian is not global but it still has the reparameterisation
invariant property. Such theory is expected to provide the ideal stage for formulating fundamental
theories of physics, especially for cases such as when one needs to consider the mixing of spacetime
and field variables. It is shown that locally, any conventional Lagrangian could be reformulated
by the parameter independent Lagrangian. Furthermore, the parameter independent property will
gives us the freedom of choosing a parameter, which in some cases turns out to be useful in finding
solutions and symmetries.
