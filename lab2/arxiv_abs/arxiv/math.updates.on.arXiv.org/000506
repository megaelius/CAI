The current bottleneck of globally solving mixed-integer (non-convex) quadratically constrained
problem (MIQCP) is still to construct strong but computationally cheap convex relaxations, especially
when dense quadratic functions are present. We propose a cutting surface procedure based on multiple
diagonal perturbations to derive strong convex quadratic relaxations for nonconvex quadratic
problem with separable constraints. Our resulting relaxation does not use significantly more
variables than the original problem, in contrast to many other relaxations based on lifting. The
corresponding separation problem is a highly structured semidefinite program (SDP) with convex
but non-smooth objective. We propose to solve this separation problem with a specialized primal-barrier
coordinate minimization algorithm. Computational results show that our approach is very promising.
First, our separation algorithm is at least an order of magnitude faster than interior point methods
for SDPs on problems up to a few hundred variables. Secondly, on nonconvex quadratic integer problems,
our cutting surface procedure provides lower bounds of almost the same strength with the diagonal
SDP bounds used by (Buchheim and Wiegele, 2013) in their branch-and-bound code Q-MIST, while our
procedure is at least an order of magnitude faster on problems with dimension greater than 70. Finally,
combined with (linear) projected RLT cutting planes proposed by (Saxena, Bonami and Lee, 2011),
our procedure provides slightly weaker bounds than their projected SDP+RLT cutting surface procedure,
but in several order of magnitude shorter time. Finally we discuss various avenues to extend our
work to design more efficient branch-and-bound algorithms for MIQCPs.
