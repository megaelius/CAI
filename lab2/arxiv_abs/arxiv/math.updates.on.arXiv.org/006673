In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of the COVID-19 infection.
Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is modified so as to better describe characteristic
features of the underlying pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary
infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the model includes
a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious individuals, not accounted for in the
data of new daily counts of infections. A Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update
dynamically the relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new data
on the number of new infections and disease related death become available. The underlying assumption
of the model is that the infectivity rate is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because
of a mutation of the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The sequential
Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the uncertainty in the estimate of the
model parameters, including the reproduction number, and of the size of the different cohorts.
Moreover, we introduce a dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic
and symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the quantity. This ratio
leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that plays the role of the basic reproduction
number $R_0$ of the model. When we apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection
data from several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the proposed
reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within both states, thus proving
to be a reliable summary of the success of the mitigation measures.
