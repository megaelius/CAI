This research is motivated by the study of the geometry of fractal sets and is focused on uniformization
problems: transformation of sets to canonical sets, using maps that preserve the geometry in some
sense. More specifically, the main question addressed is the uniformization of planar Sierpinski
carpets by square Sierpinski carpets, using methods of potential theory on carpets. We first develop
a potential theory and study harmonic functions on planar Sierpinski carpets. We introduce a discrete
notion of Sobolev spaces on Sierpinski carpets and use this to define harmonic functions. Our approach
differs from the classical approach of potential theory in metric spaces because it takes the ambient
space that contains the carpet into account. We prove basic properties such as the existence and
uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet problem, Liouville's theorem, Harnack's inequality,
strong maximum principle, and equicontinuity of harmonic functions. Then we utilize this notion
of harmonic functions to prove a uniformization result for Sierpinski carpets. Namely, it is proved
that every planar Sierpinski carpet whose peripheral disks are uniformly fat, uniform quasiballs
can be mapped to a square Sierpinski carpet with a map that preserves carpet modulus. If the assumptions
on the peripheral circles are strengthened to uniformly relatively separated, uniform quasicircles,
then the map is a quasisymmetry. The real part of the uniformizing map is the solution of a certain
Dirichlet-type problem. Then a harmonic conjugate of that map is constructed using the methods
developed by Rajala arXiv:1412.3348.
