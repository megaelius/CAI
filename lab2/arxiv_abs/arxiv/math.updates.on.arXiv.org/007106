The linear stability of chains of magnetic vortices in a plasma is investigated analytically in
two dimensions by means of a reduced fluid model assuming a strong guide field and accounting for
equilibrium electron temperature anisotropy. The chain of magnetic vortices is modelled by means
of the classical "cat's eyes" solutions and the linear stability is studied by analysing the second
variation of a conserved functional, according to the Energy-Casimir method. The stability analysis
is carried out on the domain bounded by the separatrices of the vortices. Two cases are considered,
corresponding to a ratio between perpendicular equilibrium ion and electron temperature much
greater or much less than unity, respectively. In the former case, equilibrium flows depend on an
arbitrary function. Stability is attained if the equilibrium electron temperature anisotropy
is bounded from above and from below, with the lower bound corresponding to the condition preventing
the firehose instability. A further condition sets an upper limit to the amplitude of the vortices,
for a given choice of the equilibrium flow. For cold ions, two sub-cases have to be considered. In
the first one, equilibria correspond to those for which the velocity field is proportional to the
local Alfv\'en velocity. Stability conditions imply: an upper limit on the amplitude of the flow,
which automatically implies firehose stability, an upper bound on the electron temperature anisotropy
and again an upper bound on the size of the vortices. The second sub-case refers to equilibrium electrostatic
potentials which are not constant on magnetic flux surfaces and the resulting stability conditions
correspond to those of the first sub-case in the absence of flow.
