We perform global and local analysis of oscillatory and damped spherically symmetric fundamental
solutions for Helmholtz operators $\big({-}\Delta\pm\beta^2\big)$ in $d$-dimensional, $R$-radius
hyperbolic ${\mathbf H}_R^d$ and hyperspherical ${\mathbf S}_R^d$ geometry, which represent
Riemannian manifolds with positive constant and negative constant sectional curvature respectively.
In particular, we compute closed-form expressions for fundamental solutions of $\big({-}\Delta
\pm \beta^2\big)$ on ${\mathbf H}_R^d$, $\big({-}\Delta+\beta^2\big)$ on ${\mathbf S}_R^d$,
and present two candidate fundamental solutions for $\big({-}\Delta-\beta^2\big)$ on ${\mathbf
S}_R^d$. Flat-space limits, with their corresponding asymptotic representations, are used to
restrict proportionality constants for these fundamental solutions. In order to accomplish this,
we summarize and derive new large degree asymptotics for associated Legendre and Ferrers functions
of the first and second kind. Furthermore, we prove that our fundamental solutions on the hyperboloid
are unique due to their decay at infinity. To derive Gegenbauer polynomial expansions of our fundamental
solutions for Helmholtz operators on hyperspheres and hyperboloids, we derive a collection of
infinite series addition theorems for Ferrers and associated Legendre functions which are generalizations
and extensions of the addition theorem for Gegenbauer polynomials. Using these addition theorems,
in geodesic polar coordinates for dimensions greater than or equal to three, we compute Gegenbauer
polynomial expansions for these fundamental solutions, and azimuthal Fourier expansions in two-dimensions.
