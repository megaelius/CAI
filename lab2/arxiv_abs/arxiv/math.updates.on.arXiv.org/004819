We generalize the notion of "localization landscape," introduced by M. Filoche and S. Mayboroda
[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 14761 (2012)] for the single-particle Schrodinger operator, to
a wide class of interacting many-body Hamiltonians. The many-body localization landscape (MBLL)
is defined on a graph in the Fock space, whose nodes represent the basis vectors in the Fock space and
edges correspond to transitions between the nodes connected by the hopping term in the Hamiltonian.
It is shown that in analogy to the single-particle case, the inverse MBLL plays the role of an effective
potential in the Fock space. We construct a generalized discrete Agmon metric and prove Agmon inequalities
on the Fock-state graph to obtain bounds on the exponential decay of the many-body wave-functions
in the Fock space. Using the MBLL and the locator expansion, we provide considerable analytical
evidence for the existence of many-body localization for a wide-class of lattice models in any physical
dimension for at least a part of their Hilbert space. The key to this argument is the observation that
in sharp contrast to the conventional locator expansion for the Green's function, the locator expansion
for the landscape function contains no resonances. For short-range hopping, which limits the connectivity
of the Fock-state graph, the locator series is proven to be convergent and bounded by a simple geometric
series. This, in combination with the discrete Agmon-like inequalities, indicates that localization
should survive weak interactions and weak hopping for a subset of states in the Hilbert space, but
cannot prove or rule out localization of the other states. We also qualitatively discuss potential
breakdown of the locator expansion in the MBLL for long-range hopping and the appearance of a mobility
edge in higher-dimensional theories.
