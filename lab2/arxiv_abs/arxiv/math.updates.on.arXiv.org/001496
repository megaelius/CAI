The Paulsen problem is a basic open problem in operator theory: Given vectors $u_1, \ldots, u_n \in
\mathbb R^d$ that are $\epsilon$-nearly satisfying the Parseval's condition and the equal norm
condition, is it close to a set of vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n \in \mathbb R^d$ that exactly satisfy
the Parseval's condition and the equal norm condition? Given $u_1, \ldots, u_n$, the squared distance
(to the set of exact solutions) is defined as $\inf_{v} \sum_{i=1}^n \| u_i - v_i \|_2^2$ where the
infimum is over the set of exact solutions. Previous results show that the squared distance of any
$\epsilon$-nearly solution is at most $O({\rm{poly}}(d,n,\epsilon))$ and there are $\epsilon$-nearly
solutions with squared distance at least $\Omega(d\epsilon)$. The fundamental open question
is whether the squared distance can be independent of the number of vectors $n$. We answer this question
affirmatively by proving that the squared distance of any $\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{13/2}
\epsilon)$. Our approach is based on a continuous version of the operator scaling algorithm and
consists of two parts. First, we define a dynamical system based on operator scaling and use it to
prove that the squared distance of any $\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^2 n \epsilon)$. Then,
we show that by randomly perturbing the input vectors, the dynamical system will converge faster
and the squared distance of an $\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{5/2} \epsilon)$ when $n$ is
large enough and $\epsilon$ is small enough. To analyze the convergence of the dynamical system,
we develop some new techniques in lower bounding the operator capacity, a concept introduced by
Gurvits to analyze the operator scaling algorithm.
