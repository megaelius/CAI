Additive models, as a natural generalization of linear regression, have played an important role
in studying nonlinear relationships. Despite of a rich literature and many recent advances on the
topic, the statistical inference problem in additive models is still relatively poorly understood.
Motivated by the inference for the exposure effect and other applications, we tackle in this paper
the statistical inference problem for $f_1'(x_0)$ in additive models, where $f_1$ denotes the
univariate function of interest and $f_1'(x_0)$ denotes its first order derivative evaluated
at a specific point $x_0$. The main challenge for this local inference problem is the understanding
and control of the additional uncertainty due to the need of estimating other components in the additive
model as nuisance functions. To address this, we propose a decorrelated local linear estimator,
which is particularly useful in reducing the effect of the nuisance function estimation error on
the estimation accuracy of $f'_1(x_0)$. We establish the asymptotic limiting distribution for
the proposed estimator and then construct confidence interval and hypothesis testing procedures
for $f_1'(x_0)$. The variance level of the proposed estimator is of the same order as that of the local
least squares in nonparametric regression, or equivalently the additive model with one component,
while the bias of the proposed estimator is jointly determined by the statistical accuracies in
estimating the nuisance functions and the relationship between the variable of interest and the
nuisance variables. The method is developed for general additive models and is demonstrated in
the high-dimensional sparse setting.
