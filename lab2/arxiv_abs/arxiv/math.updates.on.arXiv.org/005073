Following attempts at an analytic proof of the Pentagonal Number Theorem, we report on the discovery
of a general principle leading to the unexpected cancellation of oscillating sums, of which $\sum_{n^2\leq
x}(-1)^ne^{\sqrt{x-n^2}}$ is an example (to get the idea of the result). It turns out that sums in
the class we consider are much smaller than would be predicted by certain probabilistic heuristics.
After stating the motivation, and our theorem, we apply it to prove a number of results on integer
partitions, the distribution of prime numbers, and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott Problem. For example,
we prove that $$ \sum_{\ell^2 < x} (-1)^\ell p(x-\ell^2)\ \sim\ 2^{-3/4} x^{-1/4} \sqrt{p(x)},
$$ where $p(x)$ is the usual partition function; and also prove the following "Pentagonal Number
Theorem for the Primes", which counts the number of primes (with von Mangoldt weight) in a set of intervals
very precisely: $$ \sum_{0 \leq 2\ell < \sqrt{xT}} \Psi([e^{\sqrt{x - (2\ell)^2/T}},\ e^{\sqrt{x
- (2\ell-1)^2/T}}])\ =\ {\Psi(e^{\sqrt{x}}) \over 2}\ +\ O\left ( e^{\sqrt{x}} T^{-\frac{1}{4}
+ o(1)} \right ), $$ where $T = e^{4\alpha \sqrt{x}/3}$, where $\alpha = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^2}}$,
where $\Psi([a,b]) := \sum_{n\in [a,b]} \Lambda(n)$ and $\Psi(x) = \Psi([1,x])$, where $\Lambda$
is the von Mangoldt function. Note that this last equation (sum over $\ell$) is stronger than one
would get using a strong form of the Prime Number Theorem and also the Riemann Hypothesis (where one
naively estimates the $\Psi$ function on each of the intervals; however, a less naive argument can
give an improvement, as can be seen in corollary 1.7), since the widths of the intervals are smaller
than $e^{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{x}}$, making the Riemann Hypothesis estimate "trivial".
