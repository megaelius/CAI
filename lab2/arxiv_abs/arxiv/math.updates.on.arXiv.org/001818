This paper discusses a consensus-based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach
to solve the multi-area coordinated network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problem in a distributed
manner. Due to political and technical difficulties, it is neither practical nor feasible to solve
the multi-area coordination problem in a centralized fashion, which requires full access to all
data of individual areas. In comparison, in the proposed fully-distributed approach, local NCUC
problems of individual areas can be solved independently, and only limited information is exchanged
among adjacent areas for facilitating multi-area coordination. Furthermore, as traditional
ADMM can only guarantee convergence for convex problems, this paper discusses several strategies
to mitigate oscillations, enhance convergence performance, and derive good-enough feasible
solutions, including: (i) A tie-line power flow based area coordination strategy is designed to
reduce the number of global consensus variables; (ii) Different penalty parameters \r{ho} are
assigned to individual consensus variables and are updated via certain rules during the iterative
procedure, which would reduce the impact of initial values of \r{ho} on convergence performance;
(iii) Heuristic rules are adopted to fix certain unit commitment variables for avoiding oscillations
during the iterative procedure; and (iv) An asynchronous distributed strategy is studied, which
solves NCUC subproblems of small areas multiple times and exchanges information with adjacent
areas more frequently within one complete run of slower NCUC subproblems of large areas. Numerical
cases illustrate effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous fully-distributed NCUC approach,
and investigate key factors that would affect its convergence performance.
