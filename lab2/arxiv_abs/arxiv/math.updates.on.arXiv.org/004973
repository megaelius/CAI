For a central, not necessarily reduced, hyperplane arrangement $f$, a factorization $f = f_{1}
\cdots f_{r}$, and for $f^{\prime}$ dividing $f$, we consider the ideal of polynomials $B(S) \in
\mathbb{C}[s_{1}, \dots, s_{r}]$ satisfying the functional equation $B(S) f^{\prime} f_{1}^{s_{1}}
\cdots f_{r}^{s_{r}} \in \text{A}_{n}(\mathbb{C})[s_{1}, \dots, s_{r}] f_{1}^{s_{1} + 1} \cdots
f_{r}^{s_{r} + 1}.$ Generalizing techniques due to Maisonobe, we estimate this ideal when $f$ is
tame and when $f$ is free. For line arrangements, we compute the reduced locus cut out by all such $B(S)$
for any choice of $f^{\prime}$ and any factorization of $f$; if the factorization is into linear
terms we compute the ideal generated by all such $B(S)$. For arrangements of larger rank, if $f$ is
free and $\text{deg}(f^{\prime}) \leq 4$, we compute this reduced locus for many factorizations
of $f$ and we compute the ideal itself when $f$ is factored into linear terms. When $f$ is free and $f^{\prime}
= 1$ we compute said reduced locus for any factorization. When $f$ is tame and $r = 1$, we compute the
zeroes of the variety lying in $[-1,0)$. Consequently, we compute all the roots of the Bernstein--Sato
polynomial for a free $f$ and all the roots in $[-1,0)$ for a tame $f$. To do this we generalize a duality
formula for certain quotient modules of $\mathscr{D}_{X,\mathfrak{x}}[S] f^{\prime} f_{1}^{s_{1}}
\cdots f_{r}^{s_{r}}$ that, for $f^{\prime} = 1$ and $f$ reduced, was proved by Narv\'aez--Macarro
in the $r=1$ case and later generalized by Maisonobe to the multivariate setting. We investigate
the minimum number of hyperplanes one must add to a tame $f$ so that the resulting arrangement is free.
This notion of "freeing" a divisor was first studied by Mond and Schulze, albeit not for arrangements.
We show that small roots of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of $f$ can force lower bounds for this
number.
