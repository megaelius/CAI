Using multiple mobile robots in search missions offers a lot of benefits, but one needs a suitable
and competent motion control algorithm which is able to consider sensors characteristics, the
uncertainty of target detection and complexity of needed maneuvers in order to make a multi-agent
search autonomous. This paper provides a methodology for an autonomous two-dimensional search
using multiple unmanned search agents. The proposed methodology relies on an accurate calculation
of target occurrence probability distribution based on the initial estimated target distribution
and continuous action of spatial variant search agent sensors. The core of the autonomous search
process is a high-level motion control for multiple search agents which utilizes the probabilistic
model of target occurrence via Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage (HEDAC) method. This centralized
motion control algorithm is tailored for handling a group of search agents which are heterogeneous
in both motion and sensing characteristics. The motion of agents is directed by the gradient of the
potential field which provides near-ergodic exploration of the search space. The proposed method
is tested on three realistic search mission simulations and compared with three alternative methods,
where HEDAC outperforms all alternatives in all tests. Conventional search strategies need about
double the time to achieve proportionate detection rate when compared to HEDAC controlled search.
The scalability test showed that increasing the number of HEDAC controlled search agents, although
somewhat deteriorating the search efficiency, provides needed speed-up of the search. This study
shows the flexibility and competence of the proposed method and gives a strong foundation for possible
real-world applications.
