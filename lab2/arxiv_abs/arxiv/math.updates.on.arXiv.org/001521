We analyse in this paper a conservative analogue of the celebrated model of dynamical percolation
introduced by H\"aggstr\"om, Peres and Steif in [HPS97]. It is simply defined as follows: start
with an initial percolation configuration $\omega(t=0)$. Let this configuration evolve in time
according to a simple exclusion process with symmetric kernel $K(x,y)$. We start with a general
investigation (following [HPS97]) of this dynamical process $t \mapsto \omega_K(t)$ which we
call $K$-exclusion dynamical percolation. We then proceed with a detailed analysis of the planar
case at the critical point (both for the triangular grid and the square lattice $Z^2$) where we consider
the power-law kernels $K^\alpha$ \[ K^{\alpha}(x,y) \propto \frac 1 {\|x-y\|_2^{2+\alpha}}
\, . \] We prove that if $\alpha > 0$ is chosen small enough, there exist exceptional times $t$ for which
an infinite cluster appears in $\omega_{K^{\alpha}}(t)$. (On the triangular grid, we prove that
it holds for all $\alpha < \alpha_0 = \frac {217}{816}$.) The existence of such exceptional times
for standard i.i.d. dynamical percolation (where sites evolve according to independent Poisson
point processes) goes back to the work by Schramm-Steif in [SS10]. In order to handle such a $K$-exclusion
dynamics, we push further the spectral analysis of exclusion noise sensitivity which had been initiated
in [BGS13]. (The latter paper can be viewed as a conservative analogue of the seminal paper by Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm
[BKS99] on i.i.d. noise sensitivity.) The case of a nearest-neighbour simple exclusion process,
corresponding to the limiting case $\alpha = +\infty$, is left widely open.
