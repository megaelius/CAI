We consider the estimation of parameter-dependent statistics of functional outputs of elliptic
boundary value problems (BVPs) with parametrized random and deterministic inputs. For a given
value of the deterministic paremeter, a stochastic Galerkin finite element (SGFE) method can estimate
the corresponding expectation and variance of a linear output at the cost of a single solution of
a large block-structured linear system of equations. We propose a stochastic Galerkin reduced
basis (SGRB) method as a means to lower the computational burden when statistical outputs are required
for a large number of deterministic parameter queries. Our working assumption is that we have access
to the computational resources necessary to set up such a reduced order model for a spatial-stochastic
weak formulation of the parameter-dependent BVP. To derive an SGRB model, we project the spatial-stochastic
weak solution of a parameter-dependent SGFE model onto a POD reduced basis generated from snapshots
of SGFE solutions at representative values of the parameter. We propose residual-corrected estimates
of the parameter-dependent expectation and variance of linear functional outputs and provide
respective computable error bounds.~We test the SGRB method numerically for a convection-diffusion-reaction
problem, choosing the convective velocity as a deterministic parameter and the parametrized reactivity
field as a random input. Compared to a standard reduced basis model embedded in a Monte Carlo sampling
procedure, the SGRB model requires a similar number of reduced basis functions to meet a given tolerance
requirement. However, only a single run of the SGRB model suffices to estimate a statistical output
for a new deterministic parameter value, while the standard reduced basis model must be solved for
each Monte Carlo sample.
