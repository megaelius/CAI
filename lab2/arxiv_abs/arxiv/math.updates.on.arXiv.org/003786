We are motivated by the study of `hidden populations', in which all frameworks including size or
membership are unknown. The discovery of the hidden population is made possible by assuming that
its members are connected in a social network by their relationships. Chain-referral Sampling
(CRS) makes use of the graph-structure by following randomly the edges in the underlying social
networks. This leads to the study of a Markov chain on a random graph where vertices represent individuals
and edges connecting any two nodes describe the relationships between corresponding people. The
interviewees are asked for their peers, and we then deliver a number of coupons to some of the people
mentioned. One model of random graph receiving a lot of attention lately is Stochastic block-model
(SBM), which extends the well-known Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs to populations partitioned into communities.
The SBM considered here is characterized by a number of vertices $N$ (size of the population), a number
of communities $m$, a block distribution $\pi=(\pi_1,...,\pi_m)$ representing the proportion
of each community (block) and a pattern of connecting vertices between blocks given by the matrix
$P=(\lambda_{kl}/N)_{(k,l) \in \{1,...,m\}^2}$. In this paper, we give a rigorous description
of the dynamic of CRS process in discrete time on an SBM. The difficulty lies in handling the heterogeneity
of the graph. In our model, the graph and random walk are constructed simultaneously. Then, we study
the evolution of this chain by considering the normalized process on the time scale $[0,1]$. We prove
that when the population's size is large, the normalized stochastic process of the referral chain
behaves like a deterministic curve which is the unique solution of a system of ODEs.
