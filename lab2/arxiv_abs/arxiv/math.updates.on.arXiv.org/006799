The purpose of this paper is to give a systematic description of potentials decaying to zero at infinity,
which generate eigenvalues at the edge of the absolutely continuous spectrum when combined with
non-local operators defined by Bernstein functions of the Laplacian. By introducing suitable
H\"{o}lder-Zygmund type spaces with different scale functions than usual, we study the action
of these non-local Schr\"{o}dinger operators in terms of second-order centered differences of
eigenfunctions integrated with respect to singular kernels. First we obtain conditions under
which the potentials decay at all, and are bounded continuous functions. Next we derive decay rates
at infinity separately for operators with regularly varying and exponentially light L\`{e}vy
jump kernels. We show situations in which no decay occurs, implying that zero-energy eigenfunctions
with specific decay properties cannot occur. Then we obtain detailed results on the sign of potentials
at infinity which, apart from asymptotic behaviour at infinity, is a second main feature responsible
for the occurrence or absence of zero eigenvalues. Finally, we study the behaviour of potentials
at the origin, and analyze a delicate interplay between the pinning effect resulting from a well
at zero combined with decay and sign at infinity, as a main mechanism in the formation of zero-energy
bound states. Among the many possible examples of non-local operators, we single out the fractional
Laplacian and the massive relativistic operator, and we will derive and make extensive use of an
additive relationship between the two. In the paper we propose a unified framework and develop a
purely analytic approach.
