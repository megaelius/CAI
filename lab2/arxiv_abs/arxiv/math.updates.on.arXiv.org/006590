Consider a population whose size changes stepwise by one of its members reproducing or dying (disappearing),
but is otherwise quite general. At such a transition, the population size thus changes by a one of
the values -1, 1, 2, 3,..., etc. If the initial size is denoted $Z_0$ and the $n$th change by $C_n$,
population sizes hence develop successively as $Z_1=Z_0+C_1, Z_2=Z_1+C_2$ and so on, indefinitely
or until there are no further size changes, due to extinction. Extinction is thus assumed final,
so that $Z_n=0$ implies that $Z_{n+1}=0$, but there is no other finite absorbing class of population
sizes. We make no assumptions about the time durations between the successive changes. In the real
world, or more specific models, those may be of varying length, depending upon individual life span
distributions and their interdependencies, the age-distribution at hand and intervening circumstances.
Or we could consider toy models, with one change per time unit, until extinction. Changes can also
have quite varying distributions. The basic assumption is that there is a carrying capacity, i.e.
a non-negative number $K$ such that the conditional expectation of the change, given the complete
past history, is positive whenever the population is non-extinct but small, i.e. $0<Z_n<K$, and
negative whenever the population exceeds the carrying capacity. The straightforward, but in contents
and implications far-reaching, result is that all such populations must die out. It applies directly
to a wide class of population models, fulfilling the requirement that individual reproductive
events do not occur simultaneously, and by analogy even wider.
