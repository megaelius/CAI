In this work, we consider the problem of optimal design of an acoustic cloak under uncertainty and
develop scalable approximation and optimization methods to solve this problem. The design variable
is taken as an infinite-dimensional spatially-varying field that represents the material property,
while an additive infinite-dimensional random field represents the variability of the material
property or the manufacturing error. Discretization of this optimal design problem results in
high-dimensional design variables and uncertain parameters. To solve this problem, we develop
a computational approach based on a Taylor approximation and an approximate Newton method for optimization,
which is based on a Hessian derived at the mean of the random field. We show our approach is scalable
with respect to the dimension of both the design variables and uncertain parameters, in the sense
that the necessary number of acoustic wave propagations is essentially independent of these dimensions,
for numerical experiments with up to one million design variables and half a million uncertain parameters.
We demonstrate that, using our computational approach, an optimal design of the acoustic cloak
that is robust to material uncertainty is achieved in a tractable manner. The optimal design under
uncertainty problem is posed and solved for the classical circular obstacle surrounded by a ring-shaped
cloaking region, subjected to both a single-direction single-frequency incident wave and multiple-direction
multiple-frequency incident waves. Finally, we apply the method to a deterministic large-scale
optimal cloaking problem with complex geometry, to demonstrate that the approximate Newton method's
Hessian computation is viable for large, complex problems.
