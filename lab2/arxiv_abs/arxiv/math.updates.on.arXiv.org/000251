The high-order accuracy of Fourier method makes it the method of choice in many large scale simulations.
We discuss here the stability of Fourier method for nonlinear evolution problems, focusing on the
two prototypical cases of the inviscid Burgers' equation and the multi-dimensional incompressible
Euler equations. The Fourier method for such problems with quadratic nonlinearities comes in two
main flavors. One is the spectral Fourier method. The other is the 2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier method,
where one removes the highest 1/3 portion of the spectrum; this is often the method of choice to maintain
the balance of quadratic energy and avoid aliasing errors. Two main themes are discussed in this
paper. First, we prove that as long as the underlying exact solution has a minimal C^{1+\alpha} spatial
regularity, then both the spectral and the 2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier methods are stable. Consequently,
we prove their spectral convergence for smooth solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and the
incompressible Euler equations. On the other hand, we prove that after a critical time at which the
underlying solution lacks sufficient smoothness, then both the spectral and the 2/3 pseudo-spectral
Fourier methods exhibit nonlinear instabilities which are realized through spurious oscillations.
In particular, after shock formation in inviscid Burgers' equation, the total variation of bounded
(pseudo-) spectral Fourier solutions must increase with the number of increasing modes and we stipulate
the analogous situation occurs with the 3D incompressible Euler equations: the limiting Fourier
solution is shown to enforce L^2-energy conservation, and the contrast with energy dissipating
Onsager solutions is reflected through spurious oscillations.
