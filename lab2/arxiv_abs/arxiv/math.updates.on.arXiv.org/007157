In this paper, we focus on the following question. Assume $\phi$ is a discrete Gaussian free field
(GFF) on $\Lambda \subset \frac 1 n \mathbb{Z}^2$ and that we are given $e^{iT \phi}$, or equivalently
$\phi \pmod{\frac {2\pi} T}$. Can we recover the macroscopic observables of $\phi$ up to $o(1)$
precision? We prove that this statistical reconstruction problem undergoes the following Kosterlitz-Thouless
type phase transition: -) If $T<T_{rec}^-$ , one can fully recover $\phi$ from the knowledge of $\phi
\pmod{\frac {2\pi} T}$. In this regime our proof relies on a new type of Peierls argument which we
call annealed Peierls argument and which allows us to deal with an unknown quenched groundstate.
-) If $T>T_{rec}^+$, it is impossible to fully recover the field $\phi$ from the knowledge of $\phi
\pmod{\frac {2\pi} T}$. To prove this result, we generalise the delocalisation theorem by Fr\"ohlich-Spencer
to the case of integer-valued GFF in an inhomogeneous medium. This delocalisation result is of independent
interest and we give an application of our techniques to the {\em random-phase Sine-Gordon model}
in Appendix B. Also, an interesting connection with Riemann-theta functions is drawn along the
proof. This statistical reconstruction problem is motivated by the two-dimensional XY and Villain
models. Indeed, at low-temperature $T$, the large scale fluctuations of these continuous spin
systems are conjectured to be governed by a Gaussian free field. It is then natural to ask if one can
recover the underlying macroscopic GFF from the observation of the spins of the XY or Villain model.
Another motivation for this work is that it provides us with an ``integrable model'' (the GFF) that
undergoes a KT transition.
