We consider the least-squares variational kernel-based methods for numerical solution of partial
differential equations. Indeed, we focus on least-squares principles to develop meshfree methods
to find the numerical solution of a general second order ADN elliptic boundary value problem in domain
$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ under Dirichlet boundary conditions. Most notably, in these principles
it is not assumed that differential operator is self-adjoint or positive definite as it would have
to be in the Rayleigh-Ritz setting. However, the new scheme leads to a symmetric and positive definite
algebraic system allowing us to circumvent the compatibility conditions arising in standard and
mixed-Galerkin methods. In particular, the resulting method does not require certain subspaces
satisfying any boundary condition. The trial space for discretization is provided via standard
kernels that reproduce $H^\tau(\Omega)$, $\tau>d/2$, as their native spaces. Therefore, the
smoothness of the approximation functions can be arbitrary increased without any additional task.
The solvability of the scheme is proved and the error estimates are derived for functions in appropriate
Sobolev spaces. For the weighted discrete least-squares principles, we show that the optimal rate
of convergence in $L^2(\Omega)$ is accessible. Furthermore, for $d \le 3$, the proposed method
has optimal rate of convergence in $H^k(\Omega)$ whenever $k \le \tau$. The condition number of
the final linear system is approximated in terms of discterization quality. Finally, the results
of some computational experiments support the theoretical error bounds.
