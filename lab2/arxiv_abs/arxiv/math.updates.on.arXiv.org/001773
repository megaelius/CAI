The study of entire holomorphic curves contained in projective algebraic varieties is intimately
related to fascinating questions of geometry and number theory -- especially through the concepts
of curvature and positivity which are central themes in Kodaira's contributions to mathematics.
The aim of these lectures is to present recent results concerning the geometric side of the problem.
The Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture stipulates that for every projective variety $X$ of general
type over $\mathbb{C}$, there exists a proper algebraic subvariety $Y$ of $X$ containing all non
constant entire curves $f:\mathbb{C}\to X$. Using the formalism of directed varieties and jet
bundles, we show that this assertion holds true in case $X$ satisfies a strong general type condition
that is related to a certain jet-semistability property of the tangent bundle $T_X$. It is possible
to exploit similar techniques to investigate a famous conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (1970),
according to which a generic algebraic hypersurface of dimension $n$ and of sufficiently large
degree $d\ge d_n$ in the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ is hyperbolic: in the early
2000's, Yum-Tong Siu proposed a strategy that led in 2015 to a proof based on a clever use of slanted
vector fields on jet spaces, combined with Nevanlinna theory arguments. In 2016, the conjecture
has been settled in a different way by Damian Brotbek, making a more direct use of Wronskian differential
operators and associated multiplier ideals; shortly afterwards, Ya Deng showed how the proof could
be modified to yield an explicit value of $d_n$. We give here a short proof based on a drastic simplification
of their ideas, along with a further improvement of Deng's bound, namely $d_n=\lfloor\frac{1}{5}(en)^{2n+2}\rfloor$.
