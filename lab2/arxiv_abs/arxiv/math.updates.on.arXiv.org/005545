Let $X^N = (X_1^N,\dots, X^N_d)$ be a d-tuple of $N\times N$ independent GUE random matrices and
$Z^{NM}$ be any family of deterministic matrices in $\mathbb{M}_N(\mathbb{C})\otimes \mathbb{M}_M(\mathbb{C})$.
Let $P$ be a self-adjoint non-commutative polynomial. A seminal work of Voiculescu shows that the
empirical measure of the eigenvalues of $P(X^N)$ converges towards a deterministic measure defined
thanks to free probability theory. Let now $f$ be a smooth function, the main technical result of
this paper is a precise bound of the difference between the expectation of $$\frac{1}{MN}\text{Tr}\left(
f(P(X^N\otimes I_M,Z^{NM})) \right)$$ and its limit when $N$ goes to infinity. If $f$ is six times
differentiable, we show that it is bounded by $M^2\left\Vert f\right\Vert_{\mathcal{C}^6}N^{-2}$.
As a corollary we obtain a new proof of a result of Haagerup and Thorbj\o rnsen, later developed by
Male, which gives sufficient conditions for the operator norm of a polynomial evaluated in $(X^N,Z^{NM},{Z^{NM}}^*)$
to converge almost surely towards its free limit. Restricting ourselves to polynomials in independent
GUE matrices, we give concentration estimates on the largest eingenvalue of these polynomials
around their free limit. A direct consequence of these inequalities is that there exists some $\beta>0$
such that for any $\varepsilon_1<3+\beta)^{-1}$ and $\varepsilon_2<1/4$, almost surely for
$N$ large enough, $$-\frac{1}{N^{\varepsilon_1}}\ \leq \| P(X^N)\| - \left\Vert P(x)\right\Vert
\leq\ \frac{1}{N^{\varepsilon_2}}.$$ Finally if $X^N$ and $Y^{M_N}$ are independent and $M_N
= o(N^{1/3})$, then almost surely, the norm of any polynomial in $(X^N\otimes I_{M_N},I_N\otimes
Y^{M_N})$ converges almost surely towards its free limit. This result is an improvement of a Theorem
of Pisier, who was himself using estimates from Haagerup and Thorbj\o rnsen, where $M_N$ had size
$o(N^{1/4})$.
