The decay rate of SIS epidemics on the complete graph $K_{N}$ is computed analytically, based on
a new, algebraic method to compute the second largest eigenvalue of a stochastic three-diagonal
matrix up to arbitrary precision. The latter problem has been addressed around 1950, mainly via
the theory of orthogonal polynomials and probability theory. The accurate determination of the
second largest eigenvalue, also called the \emph{decay parameter}, has been an outstanding problem
appearing in general birth-death processes and random walks. Application of our general framework
to SIS epidemics shows that the maximum average lifetime of an SIS epidemics in any network with $N$
nodes is not larger (but tight for $K_{N}$) than \[ E\left[ T\right] \sim\frac{1}{\delta}\frac{\frac{\tau}{\tau_{c}}\sqrt{2\pi}%
}{\left( \frac{\tau}{\tau_{c}}-1\right) ^{2}}\frac{\exp\left( N\left\{ \log\frac{\tau}{\tau_{c}}+\frac{\tau_{c}}{\tau}-1\right\}
\right) }{\sqrt {N}}=O\left( e^{N\ln\frac{\tau}{\tau_{c}}}\right) \] for large $N$ and for
an effective infection rate $\tau=\frac{\beta}{\delta}$ above the epidemic threshold $\tau_{c}$.
Our order estimate of $E\left[ T\right] $ sharpens the order estimate $E\left[ T\right] =O\left(
e^{bN^{a}}\right) $ of Draief and Massouli\'{e} \cite{Draief_Massoulie}. Combining the lower
bound results of Mountford \emph{et al.} \cite{Mountford2013} and our upper bound, we conclude
that for almost all graphs, the average time to absorption for $\tau>\tau_{c}$ is $E\left[ T\right]
=O\left( e^{c_{G}N}\right) $, where $c_{G}>0$ depends on the topological structure of the
graph $G$ and $\tau$.
