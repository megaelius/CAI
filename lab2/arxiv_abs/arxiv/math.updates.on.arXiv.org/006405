A Lambert series generating function is a special series summed over an arithmetic function $f$
defined by \[ L_f(q) := \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{f(n) q^n}{1-q^n} = \sum_{m \geq 1} (f \ast 1)(m) q^m.
\] Because of the way the left-hand-side terms of this type of generating function generate divisor
sums of $f$ convolved by Dirichlet convolution with one, these expansions are natural ways to enumerate
the ordinary generating functions of many multiplicative special functions in number theory.
We present an overview of key properties of Lambert series generating function expansions, their
more combinatorial generalizations, and include a compendia of tables illustrating known formulas
for special cases of these series. In this sense, we focus more on the formal properties of the sequences
that are enumerated by the Lambert series, and do not spend significant time treating these series
as analytic objects subject to rigorous convergence constraints. The first question one might
ask before reading this document is: Why has is catalog of interesting Lambert series identities
compiled? As with the indispensible reference by H. W. Gould and T. Shonhiwa, A catalog of interesting
Dirichlet series, for Dirichlet series (DGF) identities, there are many situations in which one
needs a summary reference on Lambert series and their properties. New work has been done recently
tying Lambert series expansions to partition functions by expansions of their generating functions.
In addition to these new expansions and providing an introduction to Lambert series, we have listings
of classically relevant and "odds and ends'' examples for Lambert series summations that are occasionally
useful in applications. If you see any topics or identities the author has missed, please contact
us over email to append to this reference.
