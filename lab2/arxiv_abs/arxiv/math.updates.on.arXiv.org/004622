The Harish-Chandra Fourier transform, $f\mapsto\mathcal{H}f,$ is a linear topological algebra
isomorphism of the spherical (Schwartz) convolution algebra $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G//K)$ (where
$K$ is a maximal compact subgroup of any arbitrarily chosen group $G$ in the Harish-Chandra class
and $0<p\leq2$) onto the (Schwartz) multiplication algebra $\bar{\mathcal{Z}}({\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon})$
(of $\mathfrak{w}-$invariant members of $\mathcal{Z}({\mathfrak{F}}^{\epsilon}),$ with
$\epsilon=(2/p)-1$). This is the well-known Trombi-Varadarajan theorem for spherical functions
on the real reductive group, $G.$ Even though $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G//K)$ is a closed subalgebra of
$\mathcal{C}^{p}(G),$ a similar theorem cannot however be proved for the full Schwartz convolution
algebra $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G)$ except; for $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G/K)$ (whose method is essentially
that of Trombi-Varadarajan, as shown by M. Eguchi); for few specific examples of groups (notably
$G=SL(2,\R)$) and; for some notable values of $p$ (with restrictions on $G$ and/or on members of
$\;\mathcal{C}^{p}(G)$). In this paper, we construct an appropriate image of the Harish-Chandra
Fourier transform for the full Schwartz convolution algebra $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G),$ without any
restriction on any of $G,p$ and members of $\;\mathcal{C}^{p}(G).$ Our proof, that the Harish-Chandra
Fourier transform, $f\mapsto\mathcal{H}f,$ is a linear topological algebra isomorphism on $\mathcal{C}^{p}(G),$
equally shows that its image $\mathcal{C}^{p}(\widehat{G})$ can be nicely decomposed, that the
full invariant harmonic analysis is available and implies that the definition of the Harish-Chandra
Fourier transform may now be extended to include all $p-$tempered distributions on $G$ and to the
zero-Schwartz spaces
