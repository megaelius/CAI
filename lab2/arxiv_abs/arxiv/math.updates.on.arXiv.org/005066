There are fundamental open problems in the precise global nature of RR-field tadpole cancellation
conditions in string theory. Moreover, the non-perturbative lift as M5/MO5-anomaly cancellation
in M-theory had been based on indirect plausibility arguments,lacking a microscopic underpinning
in M-brane charge quantization. We provide a framework for answering these questions, crucial
not only for mathematical consistency but also for phenomenological accuracy of string theory,
by formulating the M-theory C-field on flat M-orientifolds in the generalized cohomology theory
called Equivariant Cohomotopy. This builds on our previous results for smooth but curved spacetimes,
showing in that setting that charge quantization in twisted Cohomotopy rigorously implies a list
of expected anomaly cancellation conditions. Here we further expand this list by proving that brane
charge quantization in unstable equivariant Cohomotopy implies the anomaly cancellation conditions
for M-branes and D-branes on flat orbi-orientifolds. For this we (a) use an unstable refinement
of the equivariant Hopf-tom Dieck theorem to derive local/twisted tadpole cancellation, and (b)
the lift to super-differential cohomology to establish global/untwisted tadpole cancellation.
Throughout, we use (c) the unstable Pontrjagin-Thom theorem to identify the brane/O-plane configurations
encoded in equivariant Cohomotopy and (d) the Boardman homomorphism to equivariant K-theory to
identify Chan-Paton representations of D-brane charge. We find that unstable equivariant Cohomotopy,
but not its image in K-theory, distinguishes D-brane charge from the finite set of types of O-plane
charges.
