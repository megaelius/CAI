Given a quiver $Q$, a formal potential is called analytic if its coefficients are bounded by the terms
of a geometric series. As shown by Toda, the potentials appearing in the deformation theory of objects
on complex projective Calabi-Yau threefolds are analytic. Our paper consists of two parts. In the
first part, we establish the foundations of the differential calculus of quivers with analytic
potentials and prove two fundamental results: the inverse function theorem and Moser's trick.
As an application, we prove finite determinacy of analytic potentials with finite-dimensional
Jacobi algebra, answering a question of Ben Davison. We also prove a Mather-Yau type theorem for
analytic potentials with finite-dimensional Jacobi algebra, extending previous work by the first
author with Zhou. In the second part, we define the (weighted) Donaldson-Thomas invariants of quiver
with analytic potential and study the transformation of DT invariants under mutation. We construct
a canonical perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles on the moduli stack of finite dimensional modules
over the formal Jacobi algebra of a quiver with analytic potential. By proving a separation lemma
for analytic potentials we show that the mutation of an analytic potential is analytic, which allows
us to construct a canonical perverse sheaf on the moduli stack of finite dimensional modules over
the Jacobi algebra of an arbitrary iterated mutation of a quiver with nondegenerate analytic potential.
Finally, we show that the (weighted) DT invariants satisfy Nagao's transformation formula under
mutation by replacing Nagao's integration map by its weighted counterpart.
