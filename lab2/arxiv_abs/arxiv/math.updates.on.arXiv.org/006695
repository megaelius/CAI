We present algorithms and their implementation to compute limit cycles and their isochrons for
state-dependent delay equations (SDDE's) which are perturbed from a planar differential equation
with a limit cycle. Note that the space of solutions of an SDDE is infinite dimensional. We compute
a two parameter family of solutions of the SDDE which converge to the solutions of the ODE as the perturbation
goes to zero in a neighborhood of the limit cycle. The method we use formulates functional equations
among periodic functions (or functions converging exponentially to periodic). The functional
equations express that the functions solve the SDDE. Therefore, rather than evolving initial data
and finding solutions of a certain shape, we consider spaces of functions with the desired shape
and require that they are solutions. The mathematical theory of these invariance equations is developed
in a companion paper, which develops "a posteriori" theorems. They show that, if there is a sufficiently
approximate solution (with respect to some explicit condition numbers), then there is a true solution
close to the approximate one. Since the numerical methods produce an approximate solution, and
provide estimates of the condition numbers, we can make sure that the numerical solutions we consider
approximate true solutions. In this paper, we choose a systematic way to approximate functions
by a finite set of numbers (Taylor-Fourier series) and develop a toolkit of algorithms that implement
the operators -- notably composition -- that enter into the theory. We also present several implementation
results and present the results of running the algorithms and their implementation in some representative
cases.
