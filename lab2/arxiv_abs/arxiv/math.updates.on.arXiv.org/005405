Backscatter communication which enables wireless-powered backscatter devices (BDs) to transmit
information by reflecting incident signals, is an energy- and cost-efficient communication technology
for Internet-of-Things. This paper considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted backscatter
communication network (UBCN) consisting of multiple BDs and carrier emitters (CEs) on the ground
as well as a UAV. A communicate-while-fly scheme is first designed, in which the BDs illuminated
by their associated CEs transmit information to the flying UAV in a time-division-multiple-access
manner. Considering the critical issue of the UAV's limited on-board energy and the CEs' transmission
energy, we maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UBCN by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory,
the BDs' scheduling, and the CEs' transmission power, subject to the BDs' throughput constraints
and harvested energy constraints, as well as other practical constraints. Furthermore, we propose
an iterative algorithm based on the block coordinated decent method to solve the formulated mixed-integer
non-convex problem, in each iteration of which the variables are alternatively optimized by leveraging
the cutting-plane technique, the Dinkelbach's method and the successive convex approximation
technique. Also, the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Finally,
simulation results show that the proposed communicate-while-fly scheme achieves significant
EE gains compared with the benchmark hover-and-fly scheme. Useful insights on the optimal trajectory
design and resource allocation are also obtained.
