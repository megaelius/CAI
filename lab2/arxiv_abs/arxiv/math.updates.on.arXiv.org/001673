At the classical level the electromagnetic field can be well identified at the spatial infinity.
Staruszkiewicz pointed out that the quantization of the electromagnetic field at spatial infinity
is essentially unique and follows from the two fundamental principles: 1) gauge invariance and
2) canonical commutation relations for canonically conjugated generalized coordinates, and
constructed a simple and mathematically transparent quantum theory of the Coulomb field, predicting
(among other things) a relation between the theory of unitary representations of the $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$
group and the fine structure constant. Until now this theory has stayed outside the main stream of
the perturbative development in QED, mainly due to the unsolved infrared-type (IR) problems in
the perturbative approach. Recently however there has been performed a more careful analysis of
mass less free gauge fields, such as the electromagnetic potential field, their Wick and chronological
products, which revealed the need for a more careful construction of these fields, and which opened
a way to resolve IR problems (at least those which shows up at each order separately). In particular
the more careful definition of these fields reveals the need for the analysis of the free and the interacting
fields in QED at spatial infinity which have been unnoticed until now because the zero mass gauge
fields have been treated with insufficient care. A need for comparison of the perturbatively constructed
field at spatial infinity with the quantum phase field of the Staruszkiewicz theory arises, which
leads to the proof of universality of the unit of charge. We give here a commentary on these facts.
