The fixation probability of a single mutant invading a population of residents is among the most
widely-studied quantities in evolutionary dynamics. Amplifiers of natural selection are population
structures that increase the fixation probability of advantageous mutants, compared to well-mixed
populations. Extensive studies have shown that many amplifiers exist for the Birth-death Moran
process, some of them substantially increasing the fixation probability or even guaranteeing
fixation in the limit of large population size. On the other hand, no amplifiers are known for the
death-Birth Moran process, and computer-assisted exhaustive searches have failed to discover
amplification. In this work we resolve this disparity, by showing that any amplification under
death-Birth updating is necessarily \emph{bounded} and \emph{transient}. Our boundedness result
states that even if a population structure does amplify selection, the resulting fixation probability
is close to that of the well-mixed population. Our transience result states that for any population
structure there exists a threshold $r^*$ such that the population structure ceases to amplify selection
if the mutant fitness advantage $r$ is larger than $r^\star$. Finally, we also extend the above results
to $\delta$-death-Birth updating, which is a combination of Birth-death and death-Birth updating.
On the positive side, we identify population structures that maintain amplification for a wide
range of values $r$ and $\delta$. These results demonstrate that amplification of natural selection
depends on the specific mechanisms of the evolutionary process.
