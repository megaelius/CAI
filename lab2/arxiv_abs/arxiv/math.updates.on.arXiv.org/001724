The Goldbach conjecture states that every even number can be decomposed as the sum of two primes.
Let $D(N)$ denote the number of such prime decompositions for an even $N$. It is known that $D(N)$
can be bounded above by $$ D(N) \leq C^* \Theta(N), \quad \Theta(N):= \frac{N}{\log^2 N}\prod_{\substack{p|N
p>2}} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{p-2}\right)\prod_{p>2}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) $$ where
$C^*$ denotes Chen's constant. It is conjectured that $C^*=2$. In 2004, Wu showed that $C^* \leq
7.8209$. We attempted to replicate his work in computing Chen's constant, and in doing so we provide
an improved approximation of the Buchstab function $\omega(u)$, \begin{align*} \omega(u)=1/u,
& \quad (1\leq u\leq 2), (u \omega(u))'=\omega(u-1), & \quad (u\geq 2). \end{align*} based on work
done by Cheer and Goldston. For each interval $[j,j+1]$, they expressed $\omega(u)$ as a Taylor
expansion about $u=j+1$. We expanded about the point $u=j+0.5$, so $\omega(u)$ was never evaluated
more than $0.5$ away from the center of the Taylor expansion, which gave much stronger error bounds.
Issues arose while using this Taylor expansion to compute the required integrals for Chen's constant,
so we proceeded with solving the above differential equation to obtain $\omega(u)$, and then integrating
the result. Although the values that were obtained undershot Wu's results, we pressed on and refined
Wu's work by discretising his integrals with finer granularity. The improvements to Chen's constant
were negligible (as predicted by Wu). This provides experimental evidence, but not a proof, that
were Wu's integrals computed on smaller intervals in exact form, the improvement to Chen's constant
would be negligible. Thus, any substantial improvement on Chen's constant likely requires a radically
different method to what Wu provided.
