We consider the dynamic behavior of several variants of the Network Creation Game, introduced by
Fabrikant et al. [PODC'03]. Equilibrium networks in these models have desirable properties like
low social cost and small diameter, which makes them attractive for the decentralized creation
of overlay-networks. Unfortunately, due to the non-constructiveness of the Nash equilibrium,
no distributed algorithm for finding such networks is known. We treat these games as sequential-move
games and analyze whether (uncoordinated) selfish play eventually converges to an equilibrium
state. Thus, we shed light on one of the most natural algorithms for this problem: distributed local
search, where in each step some agent performs a myopic selfish improving move. We show that fast
convergence is guaranteed for all versions of Swap Games, introduced by Alon et al. [SPAA'10], if
the initial network is a tree, and show that this process can be sped up to an almost optimal number
of moves. For non-tree networks we show the surprising result that even one non-tree edge suffices
to destroy the convergence guarantee and no move policy can enforce convergence. This answers an
open problem from Ehsani et al. [SPAA'11] in the negative. We extend our negative results to the well-studied
original version and prove that there is no convergence guarantee -- even if all agents play optimally.
Furthermore, we show the quite surprising result that employing cost-sharing yields even worse
dynamic behavior. Finally, we contrast our mostly negative theoretical results by a careful empirical
study. Our simulations indicate two positive facts: (1) The non-convergent behavior seems to be
confined to a small set of pathological instances and is unlikely to show up in practice. (2) In all
our simulations we observed a remarkably fast convergence towards a stable network in O(n) steps,
where n is the number of agents.
