We present a novel methodology for designing output-feedback backstepping boundary controllers
for an unstable 1-D diffusion-reaction partial differential equation with spatially-varying
reaction. Using "folding" transforms the parabolic PDE into a 2X2 coupled parabolic PDE system
with coupling via folding boundary conditions. The folding approach is novel in the sense that the
design of bilateral controllers can be generalized to centering around arbitrary points, which
admit additional design parameters for both the state-feedback controller and the state observer.
The design can be selectively biased to achieve different performance indicies (e.g. energy, boundedness,
etc). A first backstepping transformation is designed to map the unstable system into a strict-feedback
intermediate target system. A second backstepping transformation is designed to stabilize the
intermediate target system. The invertibility of the two transformations guarantees that the
derived state-feedback controllers exponentially stabilize the trivial solution of the parabolic
PDE system in the L^2 norm sense. A complementary state observer is likewise designed for the dual
problem, where two collocated measurements are considered at an arbitrary point in the interior
of the domain. The observer generates state estimates which converge to the true state exponentially
fast in the L^2 sense. Finally, the output feedback control law is formulated by composing the state-feedback
controller with the state estimates from the observer, and the resulting dynamic feedback is shown
to stabilize the trivial solution of the interconnected system in the L^2 norm sense. Some analysis
on how the selection of these points affect the responses of the controller and observer are discussed,
with simulations illustrating various choices of folding points and their effect on the stabilization.
