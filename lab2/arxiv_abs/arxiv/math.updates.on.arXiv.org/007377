We study the geometry of algebraic numbers in the complex plane, and their Diophantine approximation,
aided by extensive computer visualization. Motivated by these images, called algebraic starscapes,
we describe the geometry of the map from the coefficient space of polynomials to the root space, focussing
on the quadratic and cubic cases. The geometry describes and explains notable features of the illustrations,
and motivates a geometric-minded recasting of fundamental results in the Diophantine approximation
of the complex plane. The images provide a case-study in the symbiosis of illustration and research,
and an entry-point to geometry and number theory for a wider audience. The paper is written to provide
an accessible introduction to the study of homogeneous geometry and Diophantine approximation.
We investigate the homogeneous geometry of root and coefficient spaces under the natural $\operatorname{PSL}(2;\mathbb{C})$
action, especially in degrees 2 and 3. We rediscover the quadratic and cubic root formulas as isometries,
and determine when the map sending certain families of polynomials to their complex roots (our starscape
images) are embeddings. We consider complex Diophantine approximation by quadratic irrationals,
in terms of hyperbolic distance and the discriminant as a measure of arithmetic height. We recover
the quadratic case of results of Bugeaud and Evertse, and give some geometric explanation for the
dichotomy they discovered (Bugeaud, Y. and Evertse, J.-H., Approximation of complex algebraic
numbers by algebraic numbers of bounded degree, Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Cl. Sci. (5) 8 (2009),
no. 2, 333-368). Our statements go a little further in distinguishing approximability in terms
of whether the target or approximations lie on rational geodesics. The paper comes with accompanying
software, and finishes with a wide variety of open problems.
