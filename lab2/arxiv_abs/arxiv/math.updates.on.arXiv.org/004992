Wave dynamics in topological materials has been widely studied recently. A striking feature is
the existence of robust and chiral wave propagations that have potential applications in many fields.
A common way to realize such wave patterns is to utilize Dirac points which carry topological indices
and is supported by the symmetries of the media. In this work, we investigate these phenomena in photonic
media. Starting with Maxwell's equations with a honeycomb material weight as well as the nonlinear
Kerr effect, we first prove the existence of Dirac points in the dispersion surfaces of transverse
electric and magnetic Maxwell operators under very general assumptions of the material weight.
Our assumptions on the material weight are almost the minimal requirements to ensure the existence
of Dirac points in a general hexagonal photonic crystal. We then derive the associated wave packet
dynamics in the scenario where the honeycomb structure is weakly modulated. It turns out the reduced
envelope equation is generally a two-dimensional nonlinear Dirac equation with a spatially varying
mass. By studying the reduced envelope equation with a domain-wall-like mass term, we realize the
subtle wave motions which are chiral and immune to local defects. The underlying mechanism is the
existence of topologically protected linear line modes, also referred to as edge states. However,
we show that these robust linear modes do not survive with nonlinearity. We demonstrate the existence
of nonlinear line modes, which can propagate in the nonlinear media based on high-accuracy numerical
computations. Moreover, we also report a new type of nonlinear modes which are localized in both
directions.
