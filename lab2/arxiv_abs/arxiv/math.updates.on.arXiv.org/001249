Quantum Markov semigroups characterize the time evolution of an important class of open quantum
systems. Studying convergence properties of such a semigroup, and determining concentration
properties of its invariant state, have been the focus of much research. Quantum versions of functional
inequalities (like the modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\'{e} inequalities) and the so-called
transportation cost inequalities, have proved to be essential for this purpose. Classical functional
and transportation cost inequalities are seen to arise from a single geometric inequality, called
the Ricci lower bound, via an inequality which interpolates between them. The latter is called the
HWI-inequality, where the letters I, W and H are, respectively, acronyms for the Fisher information
(arising in the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality), the so-called Wasserstein distance
(arising in the transportation cost inequality) and the relative entropy (or Boltzmann H function)
arising in both. Hence, classically, all the above inequalities and the implications between them
form a remarkable picture which relates elements from diverse mathematical fields, such as Riemannian
geometry, information theory, optimal transport theory, Markov processes, concentration of
measure, and convexity theory. Here we consider a quantum version of the Ricci lower bound introduced
by Carlen and Maas, and prove that it implies a quantum HWI inequality from which the quantum functional
and transportation cost inequalities follow. Our results hence establish that the unifying picture
of the classical setting carries over to the quantum one.
