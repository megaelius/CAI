Low-rank matrix approximation is extremely useful in the analysis of data that arises in scientific
computing, engineering applications, and data science. However, as data sizes grow, traditional
low-rank matrix approximation methods, such as SVD and CPQR, are either prohibitively expensive
or cannot provide sufficiently accurate results. A solution is to use randomized low-rank matrix
approximation methods such as randomized SVD , and randomized LU decomposition on extremely large
data sets.In this paper, we focus on the randomized LU decomposition method. First, we employ a reorthogonalization
procedure to perform the power iteration of the existing randomized LU algorithm to compensate
for the rounding errors caused by the power method. Then we propose a novel randomized LU algorithm,
called PowerLU, for the fixed low-rank approximation problem. PowerLU allows for an arbitrary
number of passes of the input matrix, $v \geq 2$. Recall that the existing randomized LU decomposition
only allows an even number of passes. We prove the theoretical relationship between PowerLU and
the existing randomized LU. Numerical experiments show that our proposed PowerLU is generally
faster than the existing randomized LU decomposition, while remaining accurate. We also propose
a version of PowerLU, called PowerLU_FP, for the fixed precision low-rank matrix approximation
problem. PowerLU_FP is based on an efficient blocked adaptive rank determination Algorithm 4.1
proposed in this paper. We present numerical experiments that show that PowerLU_FP can achieve
almost the same accuracy and is faster than the randomized blocked QB algorithm by Martinsson and
Voronin. We finally propose a single-pass algorithm based on LU factorization. Tests show that
the accuracy of our single-pass algorithm is comparable with the existing single-pass algorithms.
