Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be written uniquely as the sum of non-consecutive
Fibonacci numbers $\{F_n\}$, where we take $F_1=1$ and $F_2=2$; in fact, it provides an alternative
definition of the Fibonacci numbers. This has been generalized for any Positive Linear Recurrence
Sequence (PLRS), which is, informally, a sequence satisfying a homogeneous linear recurrence
with a positive leading coefficient and non-negative integer coefficients. Note these legal decompositions
are generalizations of base $B$ decompositions. We investigate linear recurrences with leading
coefficient zero, followed by non-negative integer coefficients, with differences between indices
relatively prime (abbreviated ZLRR), via two different approaches. The first approach involves
generalizing the definition of a legal decomposition for a PLRS found in Kolo\u{g}lu, Kopp, Miller
and Wang. We prove that every positive integer $N$ has a legal decomposition for any ZLRR using the
greedy algorithm. We also show that $D_n\,/\,n$, the average number of decompositions of all positive
integers less than or equal to $n$, is greater than 1, implying the existence of decompositions for
every positive integer $N$, but lack of uniqueness. The second approach converts a ZLRR to a PLRR
that has the same growth rate. We develop the Zeroing Algorithm, a powerful helper tool for analyzing
the behavior of linear recurrence sequences. We use it to prove a very general result that guarantees
the possibility of conversion between certain recurrences, and develop a method to quickly determine
whether our sequence diverges to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$, given any real initial values.
