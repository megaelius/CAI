Convex relaxations of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems have attracted significant interest
as in several instances they provably yield the global optimum to the original non-convex problem.
If, however, the relaxation is inexact, the obtained solution is not AC-feasible. The quality of
the obtained solution is essential for several practical applications of AC-OPF, but detailed
analyses are lacking in existing literature. This paper aims to cover this gap. We provide an in-depth
investigation of the solution characteristics when convex relaxations are inexact, we assess
the most promising AC feasibility recovery methods for large-scale systems, and we propose two
new metrics that lead to a better understanding of the quality of the identified solutions. We perform
a comprehensive assessment on 96 different test cases, ranging from 14 to 3120 buses, and we show
the following: (i) Despite an optimality gap of less than 1%, several test cases still exhibit substantial
distances to both AC feasibility and local optimality and the newly proposed metrics characterize
these deviations. (ii) Penalization methods fail to recover an AC-feasible solution in 15 out of
45 cases, and using the proposed metrics, we show that most failed test instances exhibit substantial
distances to both AC-feasibility and local optimality. For failed test instances with small distances,
we show how our proposed metrics inform a fine-tuning of penalty weights to obtain AC-feasible solutions.
(iii) The computational benefits of warm-starting non-convex solvers have significant variation,
but a computational speedup exists in over 75% of the cases.
