During early development, waves of activity propagate across the retina and play a key role in the
proper wiring of the early visual system. During the stage II these waves are triggered by a transient
network of neurons, called Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), showing a bursting activity which
disappears upon further maturation. While several models have attempted to reproduce retinal
waves, none of them is able to mimic the rhythmic autonomous bursting of individual SACs and reveal
how these cells change their intrinsic properties during development. Here, we introduce a mathematical
model, grounded on biophysics, which enables us to reproduce the bursting activity of SACs and to
propose a plausible, generic and robust, mechanism that generates it. The core parameters controlling
repetitive firing are fast depolarizing $V$-gated calcium channels and hyperpolarizing $V$-gated
potassium channels. The quiescent phase of bursting is controlled by a slow after hyperpolarization
(sAHP), mediated by calcium-dependent potassium channels. Based on a bifurcation analysis we
show how biophysical parameters, regulating calcium and potassium activity, control the spontaneously
occurring fast oscillatory activity followed by long refractory periods in individual SACs. We
make a testable experimental prediction on the role of voltage-dependent potassium channels on
the excitability properties of SACs and on the evolution of this excitability along development.
We also propose an explanation on how SACs can exhibit a large variability in their bursting periods,
as observed experimentally within a SACs network as well as across different species, yet based
on a simple, unique, mechanism. As we discuss, these observations at the cellular level have a deep
impact on the retinal waves description.
