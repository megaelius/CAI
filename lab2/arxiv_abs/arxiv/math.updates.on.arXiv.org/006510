If $X$ is a (topological) space, the $n$th finite subset space of $X$, denoted by $X(n)$, consists
of $n$-point subsets of $X$ (i.e., nonempty subsets of cardinality at most $n$) with the quotient
topology induced by the unordering map $q:X^n\to X(n)$, $(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\mapsto\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$.
That is, a set $A\subset X(n)$ is open if and only if its preimage $q^{-1}(A)$ is open in the product
space $X^n$. Given a space $X$, let $H(X)$ denote all homeomorphisms of $X$. For any class of homeomorphisms
$C\subset H(X)$, the $C$-geometry of $X$ refers to the description of $X$ up to homeomorphisms in
$C$. Therefore, the topology of $X$ is the $H(X)$-geometry of $X$. By a ($C$-) geometric property
of $X$ we will mean a property of $X$ that is preserved by homeomorphisms of $X$ (in $C$). Metric geometry
of a space $X$ refers to the study of geometry of $X$ in terms of notions of metrics (e.g., distance,
or length of a path, between points) on $X$. In such a study, we call a space $X$ metrizable if $X$ is
homeomorphic to a metric space. Naturally, $X(n)$ always inherits some aspect of every geometric
property of $X$ or $X^n$. Thus, the geometry of $X(n)$ is in general richer than that of $X$ or $X^n$.
For example, it is known that if $X$ is an orientable manifold, then (unlike $X^n$) $X(n)$ for $n>1$
can be an orientable manifold, a non-orientable manifold, or a non-manifold. In studying geometry
of $X(n)$, a central research question is "If $X$ has geometric property $P$, does it follow that
$X(n)$ also has property $P$?". A related question is "If $X$ and $Y$ have a geometric relation $R$,
does it follow that $X(n)$ and $Y(n)$ also have the relation $R$?". (Truncated)
