The coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) transmits coded multicast
messages from a server to users equipped with caches via a capacitated shared-link and was shown
to be information theoretically optimal within a constant multiplicative factor. This work extends
the MAN scheme to a class of two-hop wired-wireless networks including one server connected via
fronthaul links to a layer of $H$ helper nodes (access points/base stations), which in turns communicate
via a wireless access network to $K$ users, each equipped with its own cache. Two variants are considered,
which differ in the modeling of the access segment. Both models should be regarded as abstractions
at the network layer for physical scenarios such as local area networks and cellular networks, spatially
distributed over a certain coverage area. The key focus of our approach consists of routing MAN-type
multicast messages through the network and formulating the optimal routing scheme as an optimization
problem that can be solved exactly or for which we give powerful heuristic algorithms. Our approach
solves at once many of the open practical problems identified as stumbling blocks for the application
of coded caching in practical scenarios, namely: asynchronous streaming sessions, finite file
size, scalability of the scheme to large and spatially distributed networks, user mobility and
random activity (users joining and leaving the system at arbitrary times), decentralized prefetching
of the cache contents, end-to-end encryption of HTTPS requests, which renders the helper nodes
oblivious of the user demands.
