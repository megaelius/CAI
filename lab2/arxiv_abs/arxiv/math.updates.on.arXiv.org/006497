Let $A=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ be a vector of integers with $d=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$. By partial resolution
of the classical Abel-Jacobi map, we construct a universal twisted double ramification cycle $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$
as an operational Chow class on the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ of $n$-pointed genus
$g$ curves carrying a degree $d$ line bundle. The method of construction follows the log (and b-Chow)
approach to the standard double ramification cycle with canonical twists on the moduli space of
curves [arXiv:1707.02261, arXiv:1711.10341, arXiv:1708.04471]. Our main result is a calculation
of $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$ on the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$ via an appropriate
interpretation of Pixton's formula in the tautological ring. The basic new tool used in the proof
is the theory of double ramification cycles for target varieties [arXiv:1812.10136]. The formula
on the Picard stack is obtained from [arXiv:1812.10136] for target varieties $\mathbb{CP}^n$
in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$. The result may be viewed as a universal calculation in Abel-Jacobi
theory. As a consequence of the calculation of $\mathsf{DR}^{\mathsf{op}}_{g,A}$ on the Picard
stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$, we prove that the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of
twisted meromorphic differentials in $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ are exactly given by Pixton's
formula (as conjectured in the appendix to [arXiv:1508.07940] and in [arXiv:1607.08429]). The
comparison result of fundamental classes proven in [arXiv:1909.11981] plays a crucial role in
our argument. We also prove the set of relations in the tautological ring of the Picard stack $\mathfrak{Pic}_{g,n,d}$
associated to Pixton's formula.
