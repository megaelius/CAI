The fractional Laplacian in R^d has multiple equivalent characterizations. Moreover, in bounded
domains, boundary conditions must be incorporated in these characterizations in mathematically
distinct ways, and there is currently no consensus in the literature as to which definition of the
fractional Laplacian in bounded domains is most appropriate for a given application. The Riesz
(or integral) definition, for example, admits a nonlocal boundary condition, where the value of
a function u(x) must be prescribed on the entire exterior of the domain in order to compute its fractional
Laplacian. In contrast, the spectral definition requires only the standard local boundary condition.
These differences, among others, lead us to ask the question: "What is the fractional Laplacian?"
We compare several commonly used definitions of the fractional Laplacian (the Riesz, spectral,
directional, and horizon-based nonlocal definitions), and we use a joint theoretical and computational
approach to examining their different characteristics by studying solutions of related fractional
Poisson equations formulated on bounded domains. In this work, we provide new numerical methods
as well as a self-contained discussion of state-of-the-art methods for discretizing the fractional
Laplacian, and we present new results on the differences in features, regularity, and boundary
behaviors of solutions to equations posed with these different definitions. We present stochastic
interpretations and demonstrate the equivalence between some recent formulations. Through our
efforts, we aim to further engage the research community in open problems and assist practitioners
in identifying the most appropriate definition and computational approach to use for their mathematical
models in addressing anomalous transport in diverse applications.
