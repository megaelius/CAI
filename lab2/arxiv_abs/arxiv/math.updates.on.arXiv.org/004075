We consider the evolution of the genealogy of the population currently alive in a Feller branching
diffusion model. In contrast to the approach via labeled trees in the continuum random tree world,
the genealogies are modeled as equivalence classes of ultrametric measure spaces, the elements
of the space $\mathbbm{U}$. This space is Polish and has a rich semigroup structure for the genealogy.
We focus on the evolution of the genealogy in time and the large time asymptotics conditioned both
on survival up to present time and on survival forever. We prove existence, uniqueness and Feller
property of solutions of the martingale problem for this genealogy valued, i.e.\ $\mathbbm{U}$-valued
Feller diffusion. We give the precise relation to the time-inhomogeneous $\mathbbm{U}_1$-valued
Fleming-Viot process. The uniqueness is shown via Feynman-Kac duality with the distance matrix
augmented Kingman coalescent. Using a semigroup operation on $\mathbbm{U}$, called concatenation,
together with the branching property we obtain a L{\'e}vy-Khintchine formula for $\mathbbm{U}$-valued
Feller diffusion and we determine explicitly the L{\'e}vy measure on $\mathbbm{U}\setminus\{0\}$.
From this we obtain for $h>0$ the decomposition into depth-$h$ subfamilies, a representation of
the process as concatenation of a Cox point process of genealogies of single ancestor subfamilies.
Furthermore, we will identify the $\mathbbm{U}$-valued process conditioned to survive until
a finite time $T$. We study long time asymptotics, such as generalized quasi-equilibrium and Kolmogorov-Yaglom
limit law on the level of ultrametric measure spaces. We also obtain various representations of
the long time limits.
