One of the most expected properties of a logical system is that it can be algebraizable, in the sense
that an algebraic counterpart of the deductive machinery could be found. Since the inception of
da Costa's paraconsistent calculi, an algebraic equivalent for such systems have been searched.
It is known that these systems are non self-extensional (i.e., they do not satisfy the replacement
property). More than this, they are not algebraizable in the sense of Blok-Pigozzi. The same negative
results hold for several systems of the hierarchy of paraconsistent logics known as Logics of Formal
Inconsistency (LFIs). Because of this, these logics are uniquely characterized by semantics of
non-deterministic kind. This paper offers a solution for two open problems in the domain of paraconsistency,
in particular connected to algebraization of LFIs, by obtaining several LFIs weaker than C1, each
of one is algebraizable in the standard Lindenbaum-Tarski's sense by a suitable variety of Boolean
algebras extended with operators. This means that such LFIs satisfy the replacement property.
The weakest LFI satisfying replacement presented here is called RmbC, which is obtained from the
basic LFI called mbC. Some axiomatic extensions of RmbC are also studied, and in addition a neighborhood
semantics is defined for such systems. It is shown that RmbC can be defined within the minimal bimodal
non-normal logic E+E defined by the fusion of the non-normal modal logic E with itself. Finally,
the framework is extended to first-order languages. RQmbC, the quantified extension of RmbC, is
shown to be sound and complete w.r.t. BALFI semantics.
