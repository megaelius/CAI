We study definable sets, groups, and fields in the theory $T_\infty$ of infinite-dimensional vector
spaces over an algebraically closed field equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric (or alternating)
bilinear form. First, we define an ($\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{Z},\leq_{lex}$)-valued dimension
on definable sets in $T_\infty$ enjoying many properties of Morley rank in strongly minimal theories.
Then, using this dimension notion as the main tool, we prove that all groups definable in $T_\infty$
are (algebraic-by-abelian)-by-algebraic, which, in particular, answers a question of Granger.
We conclude that every infinite field definable in $T_\infty$ is definably isomorphic to the field
of scalars of the vector space. We derive some other consequences of good behaviour of the dimension
in $T_\infty$, e.g. every generic type in any definable set is a definable type; every set is an extension
base; every definable group has a definable connected component. We also consider the theory $T^{RCF}_\infty$
of vector spaces over a real closed field equipped with a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form
or a nondegenerate symmetric positive-definite bilinear form. Using the same construction as
in the case of $T_\infty$, we define a dimension on sets definable in $T^{RCF}_\infty$, and using
it we prove analogous results about definable groups and fields: every group definable in $T^{RCF}_{\infty}$
is (semialgebraic-by-abelian)-by-semialgebraic (in particular, it is (Lie-by-abelian)-by-Lie),
and every field definable in $T^{RCF}_{\infty}$ is definable in the field of scalars, hence it is
either real closed or algebraically closed.
