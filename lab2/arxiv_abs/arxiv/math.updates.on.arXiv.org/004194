This thesis is mainly devoted to studying integrable deformations of the ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm
S}^5$ superstring and generalized supergravity. We start to give a brief review of the ${\rm AdS}_5
\times {\rm S}^5$ superstring formulated in the Green-Schwartz formalism, and then introduce
homogeneous Yang-Baxter (YB) deformation of the ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$ superstring based
on $r$-matrices which are solutions to the homogeneous classical YB equation. By performing a supercoset
construction, we derive the general formula for homogeneous YB deformed backgrounds associated
with bosonic $r$-matrices. The deformed backgrounds are shown to be solutions of the standard type
IIB supergravity or generalized supergravity. Next, we explain that homogeneous YB deformation
can be regarded as a kind of the $O(d,d)$ duality transformations. Once YB deformations are realized
as duality transformations, the corresponding $O(d,d)$ transformations are applied to almost
all backgrounds. Moreover, we discuss spacetime structures of homogeneous YB deformed backgrounds
and clarify a T-fold structure of them by showing the associated $O(d,d; \mathbb{Z})$ $T$-duality
monodromy. Finally, we consider the Weyl invariance of string theories in generalized supergravity
backgrounds. We show that generalized supergravity can be reproduced from double field theory
with the dilaton depending on a linear dual coordinate. From this result, we construct a possible
counterterm to cancel out the Weyl anomaly of bosonic string theories on generalized supergravity
backgrounds. In particular, we show that the counterterm is definitely local. In this sense, string
theories can be consistently defined in generalized supergravity backgrounds.
