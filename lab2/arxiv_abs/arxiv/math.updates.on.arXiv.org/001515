The approximation of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an elliptic operator is a key computational
task in many areas of applied mathematics and computational physics. An important case, especially
in quantum physics, is the computation of the spectrum of a Schr\"odinger operator with a disordered
potential. Unlike plane waves or Bloch waves that arise as Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions for periodic
and other ordered potentials, for many forms of disordered potentials the eigenfunctions remain
essentially localized in a very small subset of the initial domain. A celebrated example is Anderson
localization, for which, in a continuous version, the potential is a piecewise constant function
on a uniform grid whose values are sampled independently from a uniform random distribution. We
present here a new method for approximating the eigenvalues and the subregions which support such
localized eigenfunctions. This approach is based on the recent theoretical tools of the localization
landscape and effective potential. The resulting methods, which have only been partially justified
theoretically, enable the calculation of the locations and shapes of the approximate supports
of the eigenfunctions, the approximate values of many of the eigenvalues, and of the eigenvalue
counting function and density of states, all at the cost of solving a single source problem for the
same elliptic operator. We study the effectiveness and limitations of the approach through extensive
computations in one and two dimensions, using a variety of piecewise constant potentials with values
sampled from various different correlated or uncorrelated random distributions.
