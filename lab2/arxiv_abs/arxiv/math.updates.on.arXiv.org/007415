The hardcore model on a graph $G$ with parameter $\lambda>0$ is a probability measure on the collection
of all independent sets of $G$, that assigns to each independent set $I$ a probability proportional
to $\lambda^{|I|}$. In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the parameter $\lambda$
given a single sample from the hardcore model on a graph $G$. To bypass the computational intractability
of the maximum likelihood method, we use the maximum pseudo-likelihood (MPL) estimator, which
for the hardcore model has a surprisingly simple closed form expression. We show that for any sequence
of graphs $\{G_N\}_{N\geq 1}$, where $G_N$ is a graph on $N$ vertices, the MPL of estimate $\lambda$
is $\sqrt N$-consistent, whenever the graph sequence has uniformly bounded average degree. We
then derive sufficient conditions under which the MPL estimate of the activity parameters is $\sqrt
N$-consistent given a single sample from a general $H$-coloring model, in which restrictions between
adjacent colors are encoded by a constraint graph $H$. We verify the sufficient conditions for models
where there is at least one unconstrained color as long as the graph sequence has uniformly bounded
average degree. This applies to many $H$-coloring examples such as the Widom-Rowlinson and multi-state
hard-core models. On the other hand, for the $q$-coloring model, which falls outside this class,
we show that consistent estimation may be impossible even for graphs with bounded average degree.
Nevertheless, we show that the MPL estimate is $\sqrt N$-consistent in the $q$-coloring model when
$\{G_N\}_{N\geq 1}$ has bounded average double neighborhood. The presence of hard constraints,
as opposed to soft constraints, leads to new challenges, and our proofs entail applications of the
method of exchangeable pairs as well as combinatorial arguments that employ the probabilistic
method.
