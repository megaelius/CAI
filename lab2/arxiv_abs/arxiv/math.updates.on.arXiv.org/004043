Conformal surface parameterization is useful in graphics, imaging and visualization, with applications
to texture mapping, atlas construction, registration, remeshing and so on. With the increasing
capability in scanning and storing data, dense 3D surface meshes are common nowadays. While meshes
with higher resolution better resemble smooth surfaces, they pose computational difficulties
for the existing parameterization algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel parallelizable
algorithm for computing the global conformal parameterization of simply-connected surfaces
via partial welding maps. A given simply-connected surface is first partitioned into smaller subdomains.
The local conformal parameterizations of all subdomains are then computed in parallel. The boundaries
of the parameterized subdomains are subsequently integrated consistently using a novel technique
called partial welding, which is developed based on conformal welding theory. Finally, by solving
the Laplace equation for each subdomain using the updated boundary conditions, we obtain a global
conformal parameterization of the given surface, with bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal
theory. By including additional shape constraints, our method can be easily extended to achieve
disk conformal parameterization for simply-connected open surfaces and spherical conformal
parameterization for genus-0 closed surfaces. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. When compared to the state-of-the-art conformal
parameterization methods, our method achieves a significant improvement in both computational
time and accuracy.
