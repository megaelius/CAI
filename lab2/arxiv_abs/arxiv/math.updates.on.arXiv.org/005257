A well-known theorem of Chung and Graham states that if $h\geq 4$ then a tournament $T$ is quasirandom
if and only if $T$ contains each $h$-vertex tournament the "correct number" of times as a subtournament.
In this paper we investigate the relationship between quasirandomness of $T$ and the count of a single
$h$-vertex tournament $H$ in $T$. We consider two types of counts, the global one and the local one.
We first observe that if $T$ has the correct global count of $H$ and $h \geq 7$ then quasirandomness
of $T$ is only forced if $H$ is transitive. The next natural question when studying quasirandom objects
asks whether possessing the correct local counts of $H$ is enough to force quasirandomness of $T$.
A tournament $H$ is said to be locally forcing if it has this property. Variants of the local forcing
problem have been studied before in both the graph and hypergraph settings. Perhaps the closest
analogue of our problem was considered by Simonovits and S\'os who looked at whether having "correct
counts" of a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph of $G$ implies $G$ must be quasirandom, in an appropriate
sense. They proved that this is indeed the case when $H$ is regular and conjectured that it holds for
all $H$ (except the path on 3 vertices). Contrary to the Simonovits-S\'os conjecture, in the tournament
setting we prove that a constant proportion of all tournaments are not locally forcing. In fact,
any locally forcing tournament must itself be strongly quasirandom. On the other hand, unlike the
global forcing case, we construct infinite families of non-transitive locally forcing tournaments.
