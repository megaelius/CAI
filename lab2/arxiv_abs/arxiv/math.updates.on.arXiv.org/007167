The deployment of large-scale antenna arrays for cellular base stations (BSs), termed as `Massive
MIMO', has been a key enabler for meeting the ever increasing capacity requirement for 5G communication
systems and beyond. Despite their promising performance, fully-digital massive MIMO systems
require a vast amount of hardware components including radio frequency (RF) chains, power amplifiers,
digital-to-analog converters (DACs), etc., resulting in a huge increase in terms of the total power
consumption and hardware costs for cellular BSs. Towards both spectrally-efficient and energy-efficient
massive MIMO deployment, a number of hardware-limited architectures have been proposed, including
hybrid analog-digital (HAD) structures, constant-envelope (CE) transmission, and use of low-resolution
DACs. In this paper, we overview the recent interest in improving the error-rate performance of
massive MIMO systems deployed with 1-bit DACs through precoding at the symbol level. This line of
research goes beyond traditional interference suppression or cancellation techniques by managing
interference on a symbol-by-symbol basis. This provides unique opportunities for interference-aware
precoding tailored for practical massive MIMO systems. Firstly, we characterise constructive
interference (CI) and elaborate on how CI can benefit the 1-bit signal design by exploiting the traditionally
undesired multi-user interference as well as the artificial interference from imperfect hardware
components. Subsequently, we overview several solutions for 1-bit signal design to illustrate
the gains achievable by exploiting CI. Finally, we identify some challenges and future research
directions for 1-bit massive MIMO systems that are yet to be explored.
