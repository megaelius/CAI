In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Based
on inter-city networked coupling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data
from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals
and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and hospitalized) are
firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during incubation
is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme,
the numerical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with
the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23 January to $18-m$ March, 2020
where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction days. Compared with integer-order system ($\alpha=0$),
the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing,
Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case without network, the results
indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for
China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that
have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February
to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order
model. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of a bounded solution under the initial condition
are considered in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is analyzed
and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically
stable when $R_0\le 1$, which provides a theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic
in the future.
