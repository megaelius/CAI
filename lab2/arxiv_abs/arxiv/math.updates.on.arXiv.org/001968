A triple array is a rectangular array containing letters, each letter occurring equally often with
no repeats in rows or columns, such that the number of letters common to two rows, two columns, or a
row and a column are (possibly different) non-zero constants. Deleting the condition on the letters
common to a row and a column gives a double array. We propose the term \emph{sesqui-array} for such
an array when only the condition on pairs of columns is deleted. Thus all triple arrays are sesqui-arrays.
In this paper we give three constructions for sesqui-arrays. The first gives $(n+1)\times n^2$
arrays on $n(n+1)$ letters for $n\geq 2$. (Such an array for $n=2$ was found by Bagchi.) This construction
uses Latin squares. The second uses the \emph{Sylvester graph}, a subgraph of the Hoffman--Singleton
graph, to build a good block design for $36$ treatments in $42$ blocks of size~$6$, and then uses this
in a $7\times 36$ sesqui-array for $42$ letters. We also give a construction for $K\times(K-1)(K-2)/2$
sesqui-arrays on $K(K-1)/2$ letters. This construction uses biplanes. It starts with a block of
a biplane and produces an array which satisfies the requirements for a sesqui-array except possibly
that of having no repeated letters in a row or column. We show that this condition holds if and only
if the \emph{Hussain chains} for the selected block contain no $4$-cycles. A sufficient condition
for the construction to give a triple array is that each Hussain chain is a union of $3$-cycles; but
this condition is not necessary, and we give a few further examples. We also discuss the question
of which of these arrays provide good designs for experiments.
