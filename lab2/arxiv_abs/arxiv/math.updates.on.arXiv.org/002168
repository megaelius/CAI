A mixed (time-consistent) equilibrium solution is proposed in this paper for the time-inconsistent
stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control. An example is constructed in this paper indicating
that for all the time-state initial pairs the mixed equilibrium solution exists and ten of such solutions
are presented; it is also shown in the example that neither the open-loop equilibrium control nor
the feedback equilibrium strategy exists for some initial pairs. Therefore, it is necessary to
study the mixed equilibrium solution, which will give us more flexibility to deal with the time-inconsistent
control. The mixed equilibrium solution contains two different parts: a pure-feedback-strategy
part and an open-loop-control part, which together constitute a time-consistent solution. It
is shown that the open-loop-control part will be of the feedback form of the equilibrium state. If
we let the pure-feedback-strategy part be zero or let the open-loop-control part be independent
of the initial state, then the mixed equilibrium solution will reduce to the open-loop equilibrium
control and the (linear) feedback equilibrium strategy, respectively, both of which have been
extensively studied in existing literature. Three sets of difference equations are derived to
equivalently characterize the fact that a pair of pure-feedback strategy and open-loop control
is the mixed equilibrium solution (for the time-state initial pair). The difference equations
are obtained via maximum-principle-like methodology with forward-backward stochastic difference
equations. Furthermore, for the cases with all the time-state initial pairs, neat necessary and
sufficient conditions are derived.
