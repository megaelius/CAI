We address the problem of studying multiparameter quamtum groups (=MpQG's) at roots of unity, namely
quantum universal enveloping algebras U_q(g) depending on a matrix of parameters q = (q_{ij}).
This is performed via the construction of quantum root vectors and suitable "integral forms" of
U_q(g), a restricted one --- generated by quantum divided powers and quantum binomial coefficients
--- and an unrestricted one --- where quantum root vectors are suitably renormalized. The specializations
at roots of unity of either forms are the "MpQG's at roots of unity" we are investigating. In particular,
we study special subalgebras and quotients of our MpQG's at roots of unity --- namely, the multiparameter
version of small quantum groups --- and suitable associated quantum Frobenius morphisms, that
link the (specializations of) MpQG's at roots of 1 with MpQG's at 1, the latter being classical Hopf
algebras bearing a well precise Poisson-geometrical content. A key point in the discussion ---
often at the core of our strategy --- is that every MpQG is actually a 2 --cocycle deformation of the
algebra structure of (a lift of) the "canonical" one-parameter quantum group by Jimbo-Lusztig,
so that we can often rely on already established results available for the latter. On the other hand,
depending on the chosen multiparameter q our quantum groups yield --- through the choice of integral
forms and their specialization --- different semiclassical structures, namely different Lie
coalgebra structures and Poisson structures on the Lie algebra and algebraic group underlying
the canonical one-parameter quantum group.
