A Theorem on the minimal specific energy for a system with \pm 1 charged particles interacting through
the Yukawa pair potential v is proved which may stated as follows. Let v be represented by scale mixtures
of d-dimensional Euclid's hat (cutoff at short scale distances) with d\geq 2. For any even number
of particles n, the interacting energy U_{n} divided by n, attains an n-independent minimum at a
configuration with zero net charge and particle positions collapsed altogether to a point. For
any odd number of particles n, the ratio U_{n}/(n-1) attains its minimum value, the same of the previous
cases, at the configuration with \pm 1 net charge and particle positions collapsed to a point. This
Theorem is then used to resolve an obstructive remark of an unpublished paper (Remark 7.5 of \cite{Guidi-Marchetti})
which, whether the standard decomposition of the Yukawa potential into scales were adopted, would
impede a direct proof of the convergence of the Mayer series of the two-dimensional Yukawa gas for
the inverse temperature in the whole interval [4\pi ,8\pi ) of collapse. In the present paper, it
is proven convergence up to the second threshold 6\pi and its given explanations on the mechanism
that allow it to be extend up to 8\pi . The paper distinguishes the matters concerning stability from
those related to convergence of the Mayer series. In respect to the latter the paper dedicates to
the Cauchy majorante method applied to the density function of Yukawa gas in the interval of collapses.
It also dedicates to the proof of the main Theorem and estimates of the modified Bessel functions
of second kind involved in both representations of two-dimensional Yukawa potential: standard
and scale mixture of the Euclid's hat function.
