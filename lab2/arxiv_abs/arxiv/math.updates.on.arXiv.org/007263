This paper reports on the computation of a discrete logarithm in the finite field $\mathbb F_{2^{30750}}$,
breaking by a large margin the previous record, which was set in January 2014 by a computation in $\mathbb
F_{2^{9234}}$. The present computation made essential use of the elimination step of the quasi-polynomial
algorithm due to Granger, Kleinjung and Zumbr\"agel, and is the first large-scale experiment to
truly test and successfully demonstrate its potential when applied recursively, which is when
it leads to the stated complexity. It required the equivalent of about 2900 core years on a single
core of an Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge processor running at 2.6 GHz, which is comparable to the approximately
3100 core years expended for the discrete logarithm record for prime fields, set in a field of bit-length
795, and demonstrates just how much easier the problem is for this level of computational effort.
In order to make the computation feasible we introduced several innovative techniques for the elimination
of small degree irreducible elements, which meant that we avoided performing any costly Gr\"obner
basis computations, in contrast to all previous records since early 2013. While such computations
are crucial to the $L(\frac 1 4 + o(1))$ complexity algorithms, they were simply too slow for our purposes.
Finally, this computation should serve as a serious deterrent to cryptographers who are still proposing
to rely on the discrete logarithm security of such finite fields in applications, despite the existence
of two quasi-polynomial algorithms and the prospect of even faster algorithms being developed.
