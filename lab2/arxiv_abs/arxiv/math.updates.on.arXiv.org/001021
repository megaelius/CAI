We study conditions under which a finite simplicial complex $K$ can be mapped to $\mathbb R^d$ without
higher-multiplicity intersections. An almost $r$-embedding is a map $f: K\to \mathbb R^d$ such
that the images of any $r$ pairwise disjoint simplices of $K$ do not have a common point. We show that
if $r$ is not a prime power and $d\geq 2r+1$, then there is a counterexample to the topological Tverberg
conjecture, i.e., there is an almost $r$-embedding of the $(d+1)(r-1)$-simplex in $\mathbb R^d$.
This improves on previous constructions of counterexamples (for $d\geq 3r$) based on a series of
papers by M. \"Ozaydin, M. Gromov, P. Blagojevi\'c, F. Frick, G. Ziegler, and the second and fourth
present authors. The counterexamples are obtained by proving the following algebraic criterion
in codimension 2: If $r\ge3$ and if $K$ is a finite $2(r-1)$-complex then there exists an almost $r$-embedding
$K\to \mathbb R^{2r}$ if and only if there exists a general position PL map $f:K\to \mathbb R^{2r}$
such that the algebraic intersection number of the $f$-images of any $r$ pairwise disjoint simplices
of $K$ is zero. This result can be restated in terms of cohomological obstructions or equivariant
maps, and extends an analogous codimension 3 criterion by the second and fourth authors. It follows
from work of M. Freedman, V. Krushkal and P. Teichner that the analogous criterion for $r=2$ is false.
We give a short elementary proof of a lemma on singular 4-dimensional Borromean rings, yielding
an elementary proof of the counterexample. As another application of our methods, we classify ornaments
$f:S^3 \sqcup S^3\sqcup S^3\to \mathbb R^5$ up to ornament concordance.
