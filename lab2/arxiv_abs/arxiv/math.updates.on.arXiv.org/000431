The accurate classification of galaxies in large-sample astrophysical databases of galaxy clusters
depends sensitively on the ability to distinguish between morphological types, especially at
higher redshifts. This capability can be enhanced through a new statistical measure of association
and correlation, called the {\it distance correlation coefficient}, which is more powerful than
the classical Pearson measure of linear relationships between two variables. The distance correlation
measure offers a more precise alternative to the classical measure since it is capable of detecting
nonlinear relationships that may appear in astrophysical applications. We showed recently that
the comparison between the distance and Pearson correlation coefficients can be used effectively
to isolate potential outliers in various galaxy datasets, and this comparison has the ability to
confirm the level of accuracy associated with the data. In this work, we elucidate the advantages
of distance correlation when applied to large databases. We illustrate how this distance correlation
measure can be used effectively as a tool to confirm nonlinear relationships between various variables
in the COMBO-17 database, including the lengths of the major and minor axes, and the alternative
redshift distribution. For these outlier pairs, the distance correlation coefficient is routinely
higher than the Pearson coefficient since it is easier to detect nonlinear relationships with distance
correlation. The V-shaped scatterplots of Pearson versus distance correlation coefficients
also reveal the patterns with increasing redshift and the contributions of different galaxy types
within each redshift range.
