Given a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we can represent invariants of tensor products
of fundamental representations of the quantum enveloping algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ using
particular directed graphs called webs. In particular webs are trivalent graphs (with leaves)
whose edges are labeled by fundamental representations. Picking generating morphisms and relators
we can construct a presentation of the representation category. We examine the properties of this
presentation in the case of rank $3$ spiders and certain higher rank non-simple spiders. In particular,
we prove a PBW-type theorem in the case of $\mathfrak{sl}_4$, $(\mathfrak{sl}_2)^n$, and $\mathfrak{sl}_2
\oplus \mathfrak{sl}_3$ and also give counterexamples showing that no such result is true in the
case of $(\mathfrak{sl}_2)^2 \oplus \mathfrak{sl}_3$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3 \oplus \mathfrak{sl}_3$.
Nevertheless we rephrase the PBW-type theorem as a degeneration of a particular spectral sequence,
and prove that this spectral sequence converges on the second page for $(\mathfrak{sl}_2)^n \oplus
\mathfrak{sl}_3$, giving generalized and weaker form of confluence. We then apply the above results
to the geometry of the Euclidean building in the case of $\mathfrak{sl}_4$ and $(\mathfrak{sl}_2)^n$.
In particular, we prove an upper triangularity result with respect to the geometric Satake basis
for $\mathfrak{sl}_4$, improving the results of Fontaine in \cite{fontaine:generating}. Finally
we give a geometric interpretation of webs as minimal combinatorial disks in the Euclidean building,
reinterpreting many of the combinatorial results of paper in geometric terms.
