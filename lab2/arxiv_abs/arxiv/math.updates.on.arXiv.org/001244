In recent years, the paradigm of cloud computing has emerged as an architecture for computing that
makes use of distributed (networked) computing resources. In this paper, we consider a distributed
computing algorithmic scheme for stochastic optimization which relies on modest communication
requirements amongst processors and most importantly, does not require synchronization. Specifically,
we analyze a scheme with $N>1$ independent threads implementing each a stochastic gradient algorithm.
The threads are coupled via a perturbation of the gradient (with attractive and repulsive forces)
in a similar manner to mathematical models of flocking, swarming and other group formations found
in nature with mild communication requirements. When the objective function is convex, we show
that a flocking-like approach for distributed stochastic optimization provides a noise reduction
effect similar to that of a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of
$N$ gradient samples at each step. The distributed nature of flocking makes it an appealing computational
alternative. We show that when the overhead related to the time needed to gather $N$ samples and synchronization
is not negligible, the flocking implementation outperforms a centralized stochastic gradient
algorithm based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at each step. When the objective function
is not convex, the flocking-based approach seems better suited to escape locally optimal solutions
due to the repulsive force which enforces a certain level of diversity in the set of candidate solutions.
Here again, we show that the noise reduction effect is similar to that associated to the centralized
stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at each step.
