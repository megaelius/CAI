This paper studies the Pliable Index CODing problem (PICOD), which models content-type distribution
networks. In the PICOD$(t)$ problem there are $m$ messages, $n$ users and each user has a distinct
message side information set, as in the classical Index Coding problem (IC). Differently from IC,
where each user has a pre-specified set of messages to decode, in the PICOD$(t)$ a user is "pliable"
and is satisfied if it can decode any $t$ messages that are not in its side information set. The goal
is to find a code with the shortest length that satisfies all the users. This flexibility in determining
the desired message sets makes the PICOD$(t)$ behave quite differently compared to the IC, and its
analysis challenging. This paper mainly focuses on the \emph{complete--$S$} PICOD$(t)$ with
$m$ messages, where the set $S\subset[m]$ contains the sizes of the side information sets, and the
number of users is $n=\sum_{s\in S}\binom{m}{s}$, with no two users having the same side information
set. Capacity results are shown for: (i) the \emph{consecutive} complete--$S$ PICOD$(t)$, where
$S=[s_{\min}:s_{\max}]$ for some $0 \leq s_{\min} \leq s_{\max} \leq m-t$, and (ii) the \emph{complement-consecutive}
complete--$S$ PICOD$(t)$, where $S=[0:m-t]\backslash[s_{\min}:s_{\max}]$, for some $0 < s_{\min}
\leq s_{\max} < m-t$. The novel converse proof is inspired by combinatorial design techniques and
the key insight is to consider all messages that a user can eventually decode successfully, even
those in excess of the $t$ required ones. This allows one to circumvent the need to consider all possible
desired message set assignments at the users in order to find the one that leads to the shortest code
length. In addition, tight converse results are also shown for those PICOD$(1)$ with circular-arc
network topology hypergraph.
