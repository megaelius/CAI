The classical contact process on a directed graph is a continuous-time interacting particle system
in which each vertex is either healthy or infected. Infected vertices become healthy at rate $1$,
while infecting each of their out-neighbors at rate $\lambda$. We consider a modified contact process
in which each healthy vertex avoids each of its infected in-neighbors at rate $\alpha>0$ by temporarily
deactivating the directed edge from the infected neighbor to itself until the infected neighbor
becomes healthy. We study the survival time of this model on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$, the $n$-cycle
$\mathbb{Z}_n$, and the $n$-star graph. We show that on $\mathbb{Z}$, for every $\alpha>0$, there
is a phase transition in $\lambda$ between almost sure extinction and positive probability of indefinite
survival; on $\mathbb{Z}_n$ we show that there is a phase transition between logarithmic and exponential
survival time as the size of the graph increases. On the star graph, we show that the survival time
is $n^{\Delta+o(1)}$ for an explicit function $\Delta(\alpha,\lambda)$ whenever $\alpha>0$
and $\lambda>0$. In the cases of $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_n$, our results qualitatively match
what has been shown for the classical contact process, while in the case of the star graph, the classical
contact process exhibits exponential survival for all $\lambda > 0$, which is qualitatively different
from our result. This model presents a challenge because, unlike the classical contact process,
it has not been shown to be monotonic in the infection parameter $\lambda$ or the initial infected
set. To our knowledge, this marks one of the first rigorous results for interacting particle systems
that coevolve with the underlying topology.
