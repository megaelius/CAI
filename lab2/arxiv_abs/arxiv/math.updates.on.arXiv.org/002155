In this paper, we first present a class of centralized coded caching schemes consisting of a general
content placement strategy specified by a file partition parameter, enabling efficient and flexible
content placement, and a specific content delivery strategy, enabling load reduction by exploiting
common requests of different users. Then we consider two cases, namely, the case without considering
the subpacketization issue and the case considering the subpacketization issue. In the first case,
we formulate the coded caching optimization problem over the considered class of schemes with $N2^K$
variables to minimize the average load under an arbitrary file popularity. Imposing some conditions
on the file partition parameter, we transform the original optimization problem into a linear optimization
problem with $N(K + 1)$ variables under an arbitrary file popularity and a linear optimization problem
with $K+1$ variables under the uniform file popularity. We also show that Yu {\em et al.}'s centralized
coded caching scheme corresponds to an optimal solution of our problem and the imposed conditions
are optimal properties for the uniform file popularity. In the second case, taking into account
the subpacketization issue, we first formulate the coded caching optimization problem over the
considered class of schemes to minimize the average load under an arbitrary file popularity subject
to a subpacketization constraint involving the $\ell_0$-norm. By imposing the same conditions
and using an exact DC (difference of two convex functions) reformulation method, we convert the
original problem with $N2^K$ variables into a simplified DC problem with $N(K + 1)$ variables. Then,
we use a DC algorithm to solve the simplified DC problem.
