Let G be a split semi-simple adjoint group, and S an oriented surface with punctures and special boundary
points. We introduce a moduli space P(G,S) parametrizing G-local system on S with some boundary
data, and prove that it carries a cluster Poisson structure, equivariant under the action of the
cluster modular group M(G,S), containing the mapping class group of S, the group of outer automorphisms
of G, and the product of Weyl / braid groups over punctures / boundary components. We prove that the
dual moduli space A(G,S) carries a M(G,S)-equivariant cluster structure, and the pair (A(G,S),
P(G,S)) is a cluster ensemble. These results generalize the works of V. Fock & the first author, and
of I. Le. We quantize cluster Poisson varieties X for any Planck constant h s.t. h>0 or |h|=1. First,
we define a *-algebra structure on the Langlands modular double A(h; X) of the algebra of functions
on X. We construct a principal series of representations of the *-algebra A(h; X), equivariant under
a unitary projective representation of the cluster modular group M(X). This extends works of V.
Fock and the first author when h>0. Combining this, we get a M(G,S)-equivariant quantization of
the moduli space P(G,S), given by the *-algebra A(h; P(G,S)) and its principal series representations.
We construct realizations of the principal series *-representations. In particular, when S is
punctured disc with two special points, we get a principal series *-representations of the Langlands
modular double of the quantum group Uq(g). We conjecture that there is a nondegenerate pairing between
the local system of coinvariants of oscillatory representations of the W-algebra and the one provided
by the projective representation of the mapping class group of S.
