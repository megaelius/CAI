Full waveform inversion (FWI) is an iterative nonlinear waveform matching procedure subject to
wave-equation constraint. FWI is highly nonlinear when the wave-equation constraint is enforced
at each iteration. To mitigate nonlinearity, wavefield-reconstruction inversion (WRI) expands
the search space by relaxing the wave-equation constraint with a penalty method. The pitfall of
this approach resides in the tuning of the penalty parameter because increasing values should be
used to foster data fitting during early iterations while progressively enforcing the wave-equation
constraint during late iterations. However, large values of penalty parameter lead to ill-conditioned
problems. Here, this tuning issue is solved by replacing the penalty method by an augmented Lagrangian
method equipped with operator splitting (IR-WRI as iteratively-refined WRI). It is shown that
IR-WRI is similar to a penalty method in which data and sources are updated at each iteration by the
running sum of the data and source residuals of previous iterations. Moreover, the alternating
direction strategy exploits the bilinearity of the wave equation constraint to linearize the subsurface
model estimation around the reconstructed wavefield. Accordingly, the original nonlinear FWI
is decomposed into a sequence of two linear subproblems, the optimization variable of one subproblem
being passed as a passive variable for the next subproblem. The convergence of WRI and IR-WRI are
first compared with a simple transmission experiment, which lies in the linear regime of FWI. Under
the same conditions, IR-WRI converges to a more accurate minimizer with a smaller number of iterations
than WRI. More realistic case studies performed with the Marmousi II and the BP salt models show the
resilience of IR-WRI to cycle skipping and noise.
