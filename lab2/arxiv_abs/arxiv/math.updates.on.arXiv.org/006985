First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price
auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important
challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price
auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others'
bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem
of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations
and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm
that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz
bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm
is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance,
as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent
interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem,
we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to
a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight
that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz
bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets
obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to
several existing bidding algorithms.
