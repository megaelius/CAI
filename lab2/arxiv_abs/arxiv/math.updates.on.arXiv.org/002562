Fast linear solvers and preconditioners are well developed for symmetric positive definite (SPD)
matrices. Linear or near-linear complexity ("fast") algorithms have been developed for many systems
of interest and, in many cases, theoretical results have been established on the convergence. The
nonsymmetric setting poses a number of unique challenges over SPD matrices, in theory and in practice.
Developing fast and robust nonsymmetric linear solvers is an active area of research and, in particular,
theoretical results on fast nonsymmetric solvers are limited. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is one
of the fastest numerical methods to solve large sparse linear systems. For SPD matrices, convergence
of AMG is well motivated in the A-norm, and AMG has proven an effective solver for many applications.
Recently, several AMG algorithms have been developed that are effective on nonsymmetric linear
systems. Although motivation was provided in each case, the convergence of AMG for nonsymmetric
linear systems is still not well understood, and algorithms are based largely on heuristics or incomplete
theory. Several works have delved into convergence of NS-AMG, but there has yet to be a thorough study
on conditions for convergence and, in particular, the practical implications for solver development.
Here, we present the first such work, discussing why SPD theory breaks down in the nonsymmetric setting,
and developing a general framework for convergence of NS-AMG. Classical multigrid weak and strong
approximation properties are generalized to a "fractional approximation property," and conditions
developed for two-grid and multigrid convergence in the $\sqrt{A^*A}$-norm.
