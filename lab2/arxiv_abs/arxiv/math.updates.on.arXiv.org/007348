This paper investigates the distributed fixed point finding problem for a global operator over
a directed and unbalanced multi-agent network, where the global operator is quasi-nonexpansive
and only partially accessible to each individual agent. Two cases are addressed, that is, the global
operator is sum separable and block separable. For this first case, the global operator is the sum
of local operators, which are assumed to be Lipschitz, and each local operator is privately known
to each individual agent. To deal with this scenario, a distributed (or decentralized) algorithm,
called Distributed quasi-averaged Operator Tracking algorithm (DOT), is proposed and rigorously
analyzed, and it is shown that the algorithm can converge to a fixed point of the global operator at
a linear rate under a bounded linear regularity condition, which is strictly weaker than the strong
convexity assumption on cost functions in existing convex optimization literature. For the second
scenario, the global operator is composed of a group of local block operators, which are Lipschitz
and can be accessed only by each individual agent. In this setup, a distributed algorithm, called
Distributed quasi-averaged Operator Playing algorithm (DOP), is developed and shown to be linearly
convergent to a fixed point of the global operator under the bounded linear regularity condition.
The above studied problems provide a unified framework for many interesting problems. As examples,
the proposed DOT and DOP are exploited to deal with distributed optimization, feasible point seeking
for convex inequalities, and multi-player games under partial-decision information. Finally,
numerical examples are presented to corroborate the theoretical results.
