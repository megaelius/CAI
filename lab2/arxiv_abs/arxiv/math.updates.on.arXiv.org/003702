In this work we study the stability regions of linear multistep or multiderivative multistep methods
for initial-value problems by using techniques that are straightforward to implement in modern
computer algebra systems. In many applications, one is interested in (i) checking whether a given
subset of the complex plane (e.g. a sector, disk, or parabola) is included in the stability region
of the numerical method, (ii) finding the largest subset of a certain shape contained in the stability
region of a given method, or (iii) finding the numerical method in a parametric family of multistep
methods whose stability region contains the largest subset of a given shape. First we describe a
simple procedure to exactly calculate the stability angle $\alpha$ in the definition of $A(\alpha)$-stability.
As an illustration, we consider two finite families of implicit multistep methods: we exactly compute
the stability angles for the $k$-step BDF methods ($3\le k\le 6$) and for the $k$-step second-derivative
multistep methods of Enright ($3\le k\le 7$). Next we determine the exact value of the stability
radius in the BDF family for each $3\le k\le 6$, that is, the radius of the largest disk in the left half
of the complex plane, symmetric with respect to the real axis, touching the imaginary axis and lying
in the stability region of the corresponding method. Finally, we demonstrate how some Schur--Cohn-type
theorems of recursive nature and not relying on the RLC method can be used to exactly solve some optimization
problems within infinite parametric families of multistep methods. As an example, we choose a two-parameter
family of implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods: we identify the unique method having the largest stability
angle in the family, then we find the unique method in the same family whose stability region contains
the largest parabola.
