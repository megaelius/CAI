We consider three parallel service models in which customers of several types are served by several
types of servers subject to a bipartite compatibility graph, and the service policy is first come
first served. Two of the models have a fixed set of servers. The first is a queueing model in which arriving
customers are assigned to the longest idling compatible server if available, or else queue up in
a single queue, and servers that become available pick the longest waiting compatible customer,
as studied by Adan and Weiss, 2014. The second is a redundancy service model where arriving customers
split into copies that queue up at all the compatible servers, and are served in each queue on FCFS
basis, and leave the system when the first copy completes service, as studied by Gardner et al., 2016.
The third model is a matching queueing model with a random stream of arriving servers. Arriving customers
queue in a single queue and arriving servers match with the first compatible customer and leave immediately
with the customer, or they leave without a customer. The last model is relevant to organ transplants,
to housing assignments, to adoptions and many other situations. We study the relations between
these models, and show that they are closely related to the FCFS infinite bipartite matching model,
in which two infinite sequences of customers and servers of several types are matched FCFS according
to a bipartite compatibility graph, as studied by Adan et al., 2017. We also introduce a directed
bipartite matching model in which we embed the queueing systems. This leads to a generalization
of Burke's theorem to parallel service systems.
