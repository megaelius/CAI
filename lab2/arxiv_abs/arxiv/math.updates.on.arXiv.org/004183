In this paper we study submonoids of the monoid $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\,\Rsh\!\!\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$
of almost monotone injective co-finite partial selfmaps of positive integers $\mathbb{N}$. Let
$\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$ be a submonoid of $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\,\Rsh\!\!\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$
which consists of cofinite monotone partial bijections of $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{N}}$
be a subsemigroup $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\,\Rsh\!\!\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$ which is generated
by the partial shift $n\mapsto n+1$ and its inverse partial map. We show that every automorphism
of a full inverse subsemigroup of $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$ which contains
the semigroup $\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{N}}$ is the identity map. We construct a submonoid $\mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_\infty^{[\underline{1}]}$
of $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\,\Rsh\!\!\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$ with the following property:
if $S$ is an inverse submonoid of $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\,\Rsh\!\!\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$
such that $S$ contains $\mathbf{I}\mathbb{N}_\infty^{[\underline{1}]}$ as a submonoid, then
every non-identity congruence $\mathfrak{C}$ on $S$ is a group congruence. We show that if $S$ is
an inverse submonoid of $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\,\Rsh\!\!\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$ such that
$S$ contains $\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{N}}$ as a submonoid then $S$ is simple and the quotient semigroup
$S/\mathfrak{C}_{\mathbf{mg}}$, where $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathbf{mg}}$ is minimum group congruence
on $S$, is isomorphic to the additive group of integers. Also, we study topologizations of inverse
submonoids of $\mathscr{I}_\infty^{\,\Rsh\!\!\!\nearrow}(\mathbb{N})$ which contain $\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{N}}$
and embeddings of such semigroups into compact-like topological semigroups.
