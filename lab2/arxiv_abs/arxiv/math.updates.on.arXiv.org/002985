Choosing an encoding over binary strings is usually straightforward or inessential for computations
over countable universes (like of graphs), but crucially affects already the computability of
problems involving continuous data (like real numbers), and even more their complexity. We introduce
a condition for complexity-theoretically reasonable encodings of arbitrary compact metric spaces,
quantitatively strengthening qualitative ADMISSIBILITY due to [Kreitz/Weihrauch'85]: The
MAIN THEOREM of Computable Analysis asserts that a real function $f$ is continuous iff there exists
a continuous mapping on the Cantor space of infinite binary sequences translating codes (such as
the signed-digit expansion) of real arguments $x$ to codes of real values $f(x)$. Generalizing
this characterization to functions $f:X\to Y$ between arbitrary topological T$_0$ spaces $X$
and $Y$, [KW85] had identified ADMISSIBILITY as essential for any computably 'reasonable' encoding
(called REPRESENTATIONS in Type-2 Computability Theory) of $X$'s elements as infinite binary
strings. We generalize the signed-digit representation of the real unit interval, having a modulus
of continuity linear in the entropy, to arbitrary compact metric spaces $X$. We establish this representation
to satisfy a carefully crafted quantitative refinement of the aforementioned qualitative admissibility:
(i) its modulus of continuity is optimal, i.e., linear in the metric entropy; and (ii) it is maximal
with respect to reductions that are metrically optimal in the same sense. The category of such representations
is shown closed under countable Cartesian products generalizing the Hilbert Cube. And we deduce
a tight quantitative correspondence between the modulus of continuity of functions $f$ among compact
metric spaces on the one hand and on the other hand those of code-translating mappings (known as REALIZERS)
on Cantor space.
