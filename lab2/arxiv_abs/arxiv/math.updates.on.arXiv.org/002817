Reverse mathematics studies which subsystems of second order arithmetic are equivalent to key
theorems of ordinary, non-set-theoretic mathematics. The main philosophical application of
reverse mathematics proposed thus far is foundational analysis, which explores the limits of different
foundations for mathematics in a formally precise manner. This paper gives a detailed account of
the motivations and methodology of foundational analysis, which have heretofore been largely
left implicit in the practice. It then shows how this account can be fruitfully applied in the evaluation
of major foundational approaches by a careful examination of two case studies: a partial realization
of Hilbert's program due to Simpson [1988], and predicativism in the extended form due to Feferman
and Sch\"{u}tte. Shore [2010, 2013] proposes that equivalences in reverse mathematics be proved
in the same way as inequivalences, namely by considering only $\omega$-models of the systems in
question. Shore refers to this approach as computational reverse mathematics. This paper shows
that despite some attractive features, computational reverse mathematics is inappropriate for
foundational analysis, for two major reasons. Firstly, the computable entailment relation employed
in computational reverse mathematics does not preserve justification for the foundational programs
above. Secondly, computable entailment is a $\Pi^1_1$ complete relation, and hence employing
it commits one to theoretical resources which outstrip those available within any foundational
approach that is proof-theoretically weaker than $\Pi^1_1\text{-}\mathsf{CA}_0$.
