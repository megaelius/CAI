We study the behavior of solutions to the incompressible $2d$ Euler equations near two canonical
shear flows with critical points, the Kolmogorov and Poiseuille flows, with consequences for the
associated Navier-Stokes problems. We exhibit a large family of new, non-trivial stationary states
of analytic regularity, that are arbitrarily close to the Kolmogorov flow on the square torus $\mathbb{T}^2$.
This situation contrasts strongly with the setting of some monotone shear flows, such as the Couette
flow: in both cases the linearized problem exhibits an "inviscid damping" mechanism that leads
to relaxation of perturbations of the base flows back to nearby shear flows. While this effect persists
nonlinearly for suitably small and regular perturbations of some monotone shear flows, for the
Kolmogorov flow our result shows that this is not possible. Our construction of these stationary
states builds on a degeneracy in the global structure of the Kolmogorov flow on $\mathbb{T}^2$.
In this regard both the Kolmogorov flow on a rectangular torus and the Poiseuille flow in a channel
are very different, and we show that the only stationary states near them must indeed be shears, even
in relatively low regularity $H^3$ resp. $H^{5+}$. In addition, we show that this behavior is mirrored
closely in the related Navier-Stokes settings: the linearized problems near the Poiseuille and
Kolmogorov flows both exhibit an enhanced rate of dissipation. Previous work by us and others shows
that this effect survives in the full, nonlinear problem near the Poiseuille flow and near the Kolmogorov
flow on rectangular tori, provided that the perturbations lie below a certain threshold. However,
we show here that the corresponding result cannot hold near the Kolmogorov flow on $\mathbb{T}^2$.
