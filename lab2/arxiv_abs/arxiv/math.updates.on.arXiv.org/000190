In the given article, we discuss the problem of the classification of general C$^*$-algebras. Also,
it was introduced a new notions of C$^*$-algebra of von Neumann type I, C$^*$-algebras of types II
and III. It is proved that any GCR-algebra is a C$^*$-algebra of von Neumann type I, and any C$^*$-algebra
is a NGCR-algebra if and only if this C$^*$-algebra does not have a nonzero abelian annihilator.
Also in the article there were proved that for a C$^*$-algebra $A$ there exist such unique C$^*$-subalgebras
$A_I$, $A_{II}$, $A_{III}$ that $A_I$ is a C$^*$-algebra of von Neumann type I, there does not exist
a nonzero abelian annihilator in the algebras $A_{II}$ and $A_{III}$, the lattice $\mathcal{P_{A_{II}}}$
of annihilators of $A_{II}$ is locally modular, the lattice $\mathcal{P_{A_{III}}}$ of annihilators
of $A_{III}$ is purely nonmodular. Moreover $A_I\oplus A_{II}\oplus A_{III}$ is a C$^*$-subalgebra
of $A$ and the annihilator of $A_I\oplus A_{II}\oplus A_{III}$ is the set $\{0\}$, i.e. $Ann_A(A_I\oplus
A_{II}\oplus A_{III})=\{0\}$. In the final part of the article there were introduced notions of
C$^*$-algebra of type I$_n$, C$^*$-algebra of types II, II$_1$, II$_\infty$ and III. Then we have
proven that: any simple C$^*$-algebra of von Neumann type I is a C$^*$-algebra of type I$_n$ for some
cardinal number $n$, any C$^*$-algebra of type II$_1$ is finite, any simple purely infinite C$^*$-algebra
is of type III and any W$^*$-factor of type II$_\infty$ has a proper ideal $J$ such that $J$ is a simple
C$^*$-algebra of type II$_\infty$. Finally it has been formulated a classification theorem for
simple C$^*$-algebras.
