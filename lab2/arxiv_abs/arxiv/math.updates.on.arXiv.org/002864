We consider the statistical inverse problem of estimating a background flow field (e.g., of air
or water) from the partial and noisy observation of a passive scalar (e.g., the concentration of
a pollutant). Here the unknown is a vector field that is specified by large or infinite number of degrees
of freedom. Since the inverse problem is ill-posed, i.e., there may be many or no background flows
that match a given set of observations, we adopt a Bayesian approach, incorporating prior knowledge
of background flows and models of the observation error to develop probabilistic estimates of the
fluid flow. In doing so, we leverage frameworks developed in recent years for infinite-dimensional
Bayesian inference. The contributions in this work are threefold. First, we provide conditions
under which the inference is consistent, i.e., the posterior measure converges to a Dirac measure
on the true background flow as the number of scalar observations grows large. We then give a rigorous
proof of consistency, developing a methodology that we believe will be applicable to other Bayesian
inverse problems of interest. Second, we define an adjoint method for efficient computation of
the gradient of the log likelihood, a key ingredient in many numerical methods. Finally, we identify
two interesting example problems with very different posterior structures, which we use to conduct
a large-scale benchmark of the convergence of several Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods that have
been developed in recent years for infinite-dimensional settings. In particular, we demonstrate
that two of these algorithms are capable of resolving a posterior with complex, multi-modal structure.
