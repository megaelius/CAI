Let $\mathfrak{L}$ be a Leibniz algebra, $E$ a vector space and $\pi : E \to \mathfrak{L}$ an epimorphism
of vector spaces with $ \mathfrak{g} = {\rm Ker} (\pi)$. The global extension problem asks for the
classification of all Leibniz algebra structures that can be defined on $E$ such that $\pi : E \to
\mathfrak{L}$ is a morphism of Leibniz algebras: from a geometrical viewpoint this means to give
the decomposition of the groupoid of all such structures in its connected components and to indicate
a point in each component. All such Leibniz algebra structures on $E$ are classified by a global cohomological
object ${\mathbb G} {\mathbb H} {\mathbb L}^{2} \, (\mathfrak{L}, \, \mathfrak{g})$ which is explicitly
constructed. It is shown that ${\mathbb G} {\mathbb H} {\mathbb L}^{2} \, (\mathfrak{L}, \, \mathfrak{g})$
is the coproduct of all local cohomological objects $ {\mathbb H} {\mathbb L}^{2} \, \, (\mathfrak{L},
\, (\mathfrak{g}, [-,-]_{\mathfrak{g}}))$ that are classifying sets for all extensions of $\mathfrak{L}$
by all Leibniz algebra structures $(\mathfrak{g}, [-,-]_{\mathfrak{g}})$ on $\mathfrak{g}$.
The second cohomology group ${\rm HL}^2 \, (\mathfrak{L}, \, \mathfrak{g})$ of Loday and Pirashvili
appears as the most elementary piece among all components of ${\mathbb G} {\mathbb H} {\mathbb L}^{2}
\, (\mathfrak{L}, \, \mathfrak{g})$. Several examples are worked out in details for co-flag Leibniz
algebras over $\mathfrak{L}$, i.e. Leibniz algebras $\mathfrak{h}$ that have a finite chain of
epimorphisms of Leibniz algebras $\mathfrak{L}_n : = \mathfrak{h} \stackrel{\pi_{n}}{\longrightarrow}
\mathfrak{L}_{n-1} \, \cdots \, \mathfrak{L}_1 \stackrel{\pi_{1}} {\longrightarrow} \mathfrak{L}_{0}
:= \mathfrak{L}$ such that ${\rm dim} ({\rm Ker} (\pi_{i})) = 1$, for all $i = 1, \cdots, n$.
