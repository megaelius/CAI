We introduce a novel nonlinear imaging method for the acoustic wave equation based on data-driven
model order reduction. The objective is to image the discontinuities of the acoustic velocity,
a coefficient of the scalar wave equation from the discretely sampled time domain data measured
at an array of transducers that can act as both sources and receivers. We treat the wave equation along
with transducer functionals as a dynamical system. A reduced order model (ROM) for the propagator
of such system can be computed so that it interpolates exactly the measured time domain data. The
resulting ROM is an orthogonal projection of the propagator on the subspace of the snapshots of solutions
of the acoustic wave equation. While the wavefield snapshots are unknown, the projection ROM can
be computed entirely from the measured data, thus we refer to such ROM as data-driven. The image is
obtained by backprojecting the ROM. Since the basis functions for the projection subspace are not
known, we replace them with the ones computed for a known smooth kinematic velocity model. A crucial
step of ROM construction is an implicit orthogonalization of solution snapshots. It is a nonlinear
procedure that differentiates our approach from the conventional linear imaging methods (Kirchhoff
migration and reverse time migration - RTM). It resolves all dynamical behavior captured by the
data, so the error from the imperfect knowledge of the velocity model is purely kinematic. This allows
for almost complete removal of multiple reflection artifacts, while simultaneously improving
the resolution in the range direction compared to conventional RTM.
