We develop a general framework for estimating the $L_\infty(\mathbb{T}^d)$ error for the approximation
of multivariate periodic functions belonging to specific reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RHKS)
using approximants that are trigonometric polynomials computed from sampling values. The used
sampling schemes are suitable sets of rank-1 lattices that can be constructed in an extremely efficient
way. Furthermore, the structure of the sampling schemes allows for fast Fourier transform (FFT)
algorithms. We present and discuss one FFT algorithm and analyze the worst case $L_\infty$ error
for this specific approach. Using this general result we work out very weak requirements on the RHKS
that allow for a simple upper bound on the sampling numbers in terms of approximation numbers, where
the approximation error is measured in the $L_\infty$ norm. Tremendous advantages of this estimate
are its pre-asymptotic validity as well as its simplicity and its specification in full detail.
It turns out, that approximation numbers and sampling numbers differ at most slightly. The occurring
multiplicative gap does not depend on the spatial dimension $d$ and depends at most logarithmically
on the number of used linear information or sampling values, respectively. Moreover, we illustrate
the capability of the new sampling method with the aid of specific highly popular source spaces,
which yields that the suggested algorithm is nearly optimal from different points of view. For instance,
we improve tractability results for the $L_\infty$ approximation for sampling methods and we achieve
almost optimal sampling rates for functions of dominating mixed smoothness. Great advantages
of the suggested sampling method are the constructive methods for determining sampling sets that
guarantee the shown error bounds, the simplicity and extreme efficiency of all necessary algorithms.
