We address the problem of computing the Maslov index for large linear symplectic systems on the real
line. The Maslov index measures the signed intersections (with a given reference plane) of the Lagrangian
plane associated with the unstable manifold in one far-field, as it evolves to the other far-field.
The natural chart parameterization for the Grassmannian of Lagrangian planes is the space of real
symmetric matrices. Linear system evolution induces a Riccati evolution in the chart. For large
order systems this is a practical approach as the computational complexity is quadratic in the order.
The Riccati solutions, however, also exhibit singularites (which are traversed by changing charts).
Our new results involve two trace formulae for the Maslov index as follows. The Cayley map is a diffeomorphism
from the space of real symmetric matrices to the manifold of unitary symmetric matrices. First,
the logarithm of the determinant of the Cayley map measures the angle of the Langrangian plane to
the reference plane. Hence the trace of the logarithm of the Cayley map, which equals the arctan map,
computes the same angle. With this map we show that the number of singular eigenvalues of the symmetric
chart representation equals the dimension of intersection with the reference plane, which equals
the integer jump in the Maslov index. We can push forward the Riccati flow under the arctan map and
monitor its trace. Second, the Riccati flow under the Cayley map induces a flow in the manifold of
unitary symmetric matrices. Using the natural unitary action on this manifold, we pullback the
flow to the unitary Lie algebra and monitor its trace. This avoids singularities, and is a natural
robust procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by applying them to a large
eigenvalue problem. We also discuss the extension of the Maslov index to the infinite dimensional
case.
