Spectral induced polarization (SIP) is a non-intrusive geophysical method that is widely used
to detect sulfide minerals, clay minerals, metallic objects, municipal wastes, hydrocarbons,
and salinity intrusion. However, SIP is a static method that cannot measure the dynamics of flow
and solute/species transport in the subsurface. To capture these dynamics, the data collected
with the SIP technique needs to be coupled with fluid flow and reactive-transport models. To our
knowledge, currently, there is no simulator in the open-source literature that couples fluid flow,
solute transport, and SIP process models to analyze geoelectrical signatures in a large-scale
system. A massively parallel simulation framework (PFLOTRAN-SIP) was built to couple SIP data
to fluid flow and solute transport processes. This framework built on the PFLOTRAN-E4D simulator
that couples PFLOTRAN and E4D, without sacrificing computational performance. PFLOTRAN solves
the coupled flow and solute transport process models to estimate solute concentrations, which
were used in Archie's model to compute bulk electrical conductivities at near-zero frequency.
These bulk electrical conductivities were modified using the Cole-Cole model to account for frequency
dependence. Using the estimated frequency-dependent bulk conductivities, E4D simulated the
real and complex electrical potential signals for selected frequencies for SIP. The PFLOTRAN-SIP
framework was demonstrated through a synthetic tracer-transport model simulating tracer concentration
and electrical impedances for four frequencies. Later, SIP inversion estimated bulk electrical
conductivities by matching electrical impedances for each specified frequency. The estimated
bulk electrical conductivities were consistent with the simulated tracer concentrations from
the PFLOTRAN-SIP forward model.
