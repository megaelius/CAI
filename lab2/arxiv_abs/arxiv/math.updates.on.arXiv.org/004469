We present quantum algorithms for solving finite-horizon and infinite-horizon dynamic programming
problems. The infinite-horizon problems are studied using the framework of Markov decision processes.
We prove query complexity lower bounds for classical randomized algorithms for the same tasks and
consequently demonstrate a polynomial separation between the query complexity of our quantum
algorithms and best-case query complexity of classical randomized algorithms. Up to polylogarithmic
factors, our quantum algorithms provide quadratic advantage in terms of the number of states $|S|$,
and the number of actions $|A|$, in the Markov decision process when the transition kernels are deterministic.
This covers all discrete and combinatorial optimization problems solved classically using dynamic
programming techniques. In particular, we show that our quantum algorithm solves the travelling
salesperson problem in $O^*(c^4 \sqrt{2^n})$ where $n$ is the number of nodes of the underlying
graph and $c$ is the maximum edge-weight of it. For stochastic transition kernels the quantum advantage
is again quadratic in terms of the numbers of actions but less than quadratic (from $|S|^2$ to $|S|^{3/2}$)
in terms of the numbers of states. In all cases, the speed-up achieved is at the expense of appearance
of other polynomial factors in the scaling of the algorithm. Finally we prove lower bounds for the
query complexity of our quantum algorithms and show that no more-than-quadratic speed-up in either
of $|S|$ or $|A|$ can be achieved for solving dynamic programming and Markov decision problems using
quantum algorithms.
