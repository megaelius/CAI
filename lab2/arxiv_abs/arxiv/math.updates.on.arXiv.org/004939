We develop a hypergraph-theoretic framework for Spekkens contextuality applied to Kochen-Specker
(KS) type scenarios that goes beyond the Cabello-Severini-Winter (CSW) framework. To do this,
we add new hypergraph-theoretic ingredients to the CSW framework. We then obtain noise-robust
noncontextuality inequalities in this generalized framework by applying the assumption of (Spekkens)
noncontextuality to both preparations and measurements. The resulting framework goes beyond
the CSW framework, both conceptually and technically. On the conceptual level: 1) we relax the assumption
of outcome determinism inherent to the Kochen-Specker theorem but retain measurement noncontextuality,
besides introducing preparation noncontextuality, 2) we do not require the exclusivity principle
as a fundamental constraint on measurement events, and 3) as a result, we do not need to presume that
measurement events of interest are "sharp", where the notion of sharpness implies the exclusivity
principle. On the technical level: 1) we introduce a source events hypergraph and define a new operational
quantity ${\rm Corr}$ appearing in our inequalities, 2) we define a new hypergraph invariant --
the weighted max-predictability -- that is necessary for our analysis and appears in our inequalities,
and 3) our noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities quantify tradeoff relations between three
operational quantities -- ${\rm Corr}$, $R$, and $p_0$ -- only one of which (namely, $R$) corresponds
to the Bell-Kochen-Specker functionals appearing in the CSW framework; when ${\rm Corr}=1$, the
inequalities formally reduce to CSW type bounds on $R$. Along the way, we also consider in detail
the scope of our framework vis-\`a-vis the CSW framework, particularly the role of Specker's principle
in the CSW framework and its absence in ours.
