In this work, deterministic Cartan-Randers dynamical systems, a particular class of first order
differential dynamical models for emergent quantum mechanics are considered. We show that in this
framework {\it diffeomorphism invariance}, the classical and the quantum versions of a Principle
of Inertia, reversibility of the effective quantum dynamics and a {\it covariant maximal universal
acceleration} emerge. A geometric analytic mechanism for quantum measurement processes with
gravitationally induced reduction of wave packet appears naturally. The mechanism is applied
heuristically to the quantum two slit experiment. The mechanism allows for protective measurement
and Von Neumann measurements. Furthermore, the same geometric-analytic mechanism is shown to
produce a lower bound for physical values for the eigenvalues of Hamiltonian for matter in deterministic
models. As a side effect of such mechanism, a natural explanation for the Weak Equivalence Principle
is obtained. This fact together with the emergence of classical diffeomorphism invariance make
stronger the case for the emergent origin of the gravitational interaction. An {\it abelian gauge
structure} associated with the phenomenological quantum description of Cartan-Randers systems
appears. This structure is related with representations of the Lorentz group. We explore specific
models of relativistic quantum mechanics and field theories as phenomenological descriptions
of Cartan-Randers models. Finally, we point out several open questions in the new formalism and
we discuss its relation with other emergent quantum mechanics and foundational quantum frameworks.
