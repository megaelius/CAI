The use of flying platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones,
is rapidly growing in a wide range of wireless networking applications. In particular, with their
inherent attributes such as mobility, flexibility, and adaptive altitude, UAVs admit several
key potential applications in wireless systems. On the one hand, UAVs can be used as aerial base stations
to enhance coverage, capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. For instance,
UAVs can be deployed to complement existing cellular systems by providing additional capacity
to hotspot areas as well as to provide network coverage in emergency and public safety situations.
On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within the cellular networks. In this
paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential benefits and applications of UAVs in wireless
communications is presented. Moreover, the important challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs
in UAV-enabled wireless networks are thoroughly investigated. In particular, the key UAV challenges
such as three-dimensional deployment, performance analysis, air-to-ground channel modeling,
and energy efficiency are explored along with representative results. Then, fundamental open
problems and potential research directions pertaining to wireless communications and networking
with UAVs are introduced. To cope with the open research problems, various analytical frameworks
and mathematical tools such as optimization theory, machine learning, stochastic geometry, transport
theory, and game theory are described. The use of such tools for addressing unique UAV problems is
also presented. In a nutshell, this tutorial provides key guidelines on how to analyze, optimize,
and design UAV-based wireless communication systems.
