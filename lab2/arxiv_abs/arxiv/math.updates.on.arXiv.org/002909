This paper proposes an energy-efficient counting rule for distributed detection by ordering sensor
transmissions in wireless sensor networks. In the counting rule-based detection in an $N-$sensor
network, the local sensors transmit binary decisions to the fusion center, where the number of all
$N$ local-sensor detections are counted and compared to a threshold. In the ordering scheme, sensors
transmit their unquantized statistics to the fusion center in a sequential manner; highly informative
sensors enjoy higher priority for transmission. When sufficient evidence is collected at the fusion
center for decision making, the transmissions from the sensors are stopped. The ordering scheme
achieves the same error probability as the optimum unconstrained energy approach (which requires
observations from all the $N$ sensors) with far fewer sensor transmissions. The scheme proposed
in this paper improves the energy efficiency of the counting rule detector by ordering the sensor
transmissions: each sensor transmits at a time inversely proportional to a function of its observation.
The resulting scheme combines the advantages offered by the counting rule (efficient utilization
of the network's communication bandwidth, since the local decisions are transmitted in binary
form to the fusion center) and ordering sensor transmissions (bandwidth efficiency, since the
fusion center need not wait for all the $N$ sensors to transmit their local decisions), thereby leading
to significant energy savings. As a concrete example, the problem of target detection in large-scale
wireless sensor networks is considered. Under certain conditions the ordering-based counting
rule scheme achieves the same detection performance as that of the original counting rule detector
with fewer than $N/2$ sensor transmissions; in some cases, the savings in transmission approaches
$(N-1)$.
