In the last decades a lot of work has been done in the study of Hilbert-Speiser fields. The first contribution
to the topic came from the important result contained in "Swan modules and Hilbert-Speiser number
fields" (Greither, Replogle, Rubin and Srivastav): $\mathbb{Q}$ is the only Hilbert-Speiser
field, i.e. for every number field $K\supsetneq \mathbb{Q}$ there exists a (cyclic of prime order)
tame abelian extension that does not have NIB. Subsequent research went towards the finer problem
of finding crieria for $C_l$-Hilbert-Speiser fields, i.e. fields such that every tame extension
with Galois group isomorphic to $C_l$, the cyclic group of prime order $l$, has NIB. In this work,
our intention is to consider a weakened version of NIB: we will say that a tame abelian extension $L/K$
of number fields has a weak normal integral basis if $\mathcal{M}\otimes_{\mathscr{O}_K[G]}\mathscr{O}_L$
is free of rank $1$ over $\mathcal{M}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the maximal order of $K[G]$. We shall
ask the same questions as above substituting "WNIB" to "NIB" everywhere, and the condition that
results from this substitution will be called "Leopoldt field" instead of "Hilbert-Speiser field".
We are going to find mainly necessary conditions for number fields to be $C_l$-Leopoldt, where as
before $l$ is a prime number, which also give criteria and (sometimes conditional) finiteness results
for $C_l$-Hilbert-Speiser fields; for instance we will see that this permits to correct an oversight
contained in the article "Real abelian fields satisfying the Hilbert-Speiser condition for some
small primes p" by Ichimura, whose techniques, even though they were originally conceived to deal
with Hilbert-Speiser fields, turn out to be supple enough to be applied to our problem as well.
