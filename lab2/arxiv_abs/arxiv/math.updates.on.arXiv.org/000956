A recently proposed IAS MEG inverse solver algorithm, based on the coupling of a hierarchical Bayesian
model with computationally efficient Krylov subspace linear solver, has been shown to perform
well for both superficial and deep brain sources. However, a systematic study of its sensitivity
and specificity as a function of the activity location is still missing. We propose novel statistical
protocols to quantify the performance of MEG inverse solvers, focusing in particular on their sensitivity
and specificity in identifying active brain regions. We use these protocols for a systematic study
of the sensitivity and specificity of the IAS MEG inverse solver, comparing the performance with
three standard inversion methods, wMNE, dSPM, and sLORETA. To avoid the bias of anecdotal tests
towards a particular algorithm, the proposed protocols are Monte Carlo sampling based, generating
an ensemble of activity patches in each brain region identified in a given atlas. The sensitivity
is measured by how much, on average, the reconstructed activity is concentrated in the brain region
of the simulated active patch. The specificity analysis is based on Bayes factors, interpreting
the estimated current activity as data for testing the hypothesis that the active brain region is
correctly identified, vs. the hypothesis of any erroneous attribution. The methodology allows
the presence of a single or several simultaneous activity regions, without assuming the knowledge
of the number of active regions. The testing protocols suggest that the IAS solver performs well
in terms of sensitivity and specificity both with cortical and subcortical activity estimation.
