Boundaries, GNH, and parametrized theories. It takes three to tango. This is the motto of my doctoral
thesis and the common thread along it. The thesis is structured as follows: after some acknowledgments
and a brief introduction, chapter 3 is devoted to establishing the mathematical background necessary
for the rest of the thesis (with special emphasis in the space of embeddings and the Fock construction).
Chapter 4 is based on our papers arXiv:1701.00735, arXiv:1611.09603, and arXiv:1501.05114. We
study carefully a system consisting of a string with two masses attached to the ends and try to establish
if we can identify degrees of freedom at the boundary both classically and quantically (spoiler
alert: it is not possible). The next chapter is a brief introduction to the parametrized theories
with the simple example of the parametrized classical mechanics. The 6th chapter deals with the
parametrized electromagnetism with boundaries, a generalization of our paper arXiv:1511.00826.
The following chapter focuses on the parametrized scalar field with boundaries (see arXiv:1507.05438).
The 8th chapter deals with the parametrized Maxwell-Chern-Simons and Chern-Simons theories with
boundaries. Chapter 9 delves into the theory of general relativity using the GNH algorithm, showing
that the Hamiltonian formulation (ADM) can be obtained in a more direct and simple way. The same study
is performed over the unimodular gravity. In the last chapter we gather the conclusions and some
hints about the future work. Finally, an appendix is included with some additional mathematical
topics as well as explicit computations.
