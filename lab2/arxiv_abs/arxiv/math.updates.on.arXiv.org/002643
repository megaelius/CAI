This thesis is devoted to the Differential Geometry of curves and surfaces along with applications
in Quantum Mechanics. In the 1st part we introduce the well known Frenet frame. Later, we show that
the curvature function is a lower bound for the scalar angular velocity of any other orthonormal
moving frame, from which one defines Rotation Minimizing (RM) frames as the ones that achieve this
minimum. Remarkably, RM frames are ideal to study spherical curves and allow us to characterize
them through a simple linear equation. We also apply these ideas to curves that lie on level surfaces,
by reinterpreting the problem in the context of a metric induced by a Hessian, which may fail to be
positive or non-degenerate and naturally leads us to a Lorentz-Minkowski $\mathbb{E}_1^3$ or
isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$ space. Here we develop a systematic approach to construct RM frames and
characterize spherical curves in $\mathbb{E}_1^3$ and $\mathbb{I}^3$ and furnish a criterion
for a curve to lie on a level surface. Finally, we extend these tools to characterize geodesic spherical
curves in hyperbolic and spherical spaces. In the 2nd part we apply the previous ideas in the quantum
dynamics of a constrained particle. After describing the confining potential formalism, from
which emerges a geometry-induced potential (GIP), we devote our attention to tubular surfaces
to model curved nanotubes. The use of RM frames offers a simpler description for the constrained
dynamics and allows us to show that the torsion of the centerline of a tube gives rise to a geometric
phase. Later, we study the problem of prescribed GIP for surfaces. Here we explore the GIP for surfaces
invariant by a 1-parameter group of isometries, i.e., cylindrical, revolution, and helicoidal
surfaces. Finally, we devote a special attention to helicoidal minimal surfaces and prove the existence
of geometry-induced bound and localized states.
