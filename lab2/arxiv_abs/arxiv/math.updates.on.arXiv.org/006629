We generalize a formula due to Macdonald that relates the singular Betti numbers of $X^{n}/G$ to
those of $X$, where $X$ is a compact manifold and $G$ is any subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{n}$
acting on $X^{n}$ by permuting coordinates. Our result is completely axiomatic: in a general setting,
given an endomorphism on the cohomology $H^{\bullet}(X)$, it explains how we can explicitly relate
the Lefschetz series of the induced endomorphism on $H^{\bullet}(X^{n})^{G}$ to that of the given
endomorphism on $H^{\bullet}(X)$ in the presence of the K\"unneth formula with respect to a cup
product. For example, when $X$ is a compact manifold, we take the Lefschetz series given by the singular
cohomology with rational coefficients. On the other hand, when $X$ is a projective variety over
a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we use the $l$-adic \'etale cohomology with a suitable choice
of prime number $l$. We also explain how our formula generalizes the P\'olya enumeration theorem,
a classical theorem in combinatorics that counts colorings of a graph up to given symmetries, where
$X$ is taken to be a finite set of colors. When $X$ is a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$,
our formula also generalizes a result of Cheah that relates the Hodge numbers of $X^{n}/G$ to those
of $X$. We will also see that our result generalizes the following facts: 1. the generating function
of the Poincar\'e polynomials of symmetric powers of a compact manifold $X$ is rational; 2. the generating
function of the Hodge-Deligne polynomials of symmetric powers of a smooth projective variety $X$
over $\mathbb{C}$ is rational; 3. the zeta series of a projective variety $X$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
is rational. We also prove analogous rationality results when we replace $S_{n}$ with $A_{n}$,
alternating groups.
