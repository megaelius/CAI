A fast non-convex low-rank matrix decomposition method for potential field data separation is
proposed. The singular value decomposition of the large size trajectory matrix, which is also a
block Hankel matrix, is obtained using a fast randomized singular value decomposition algorithm
in which fast block Hankel matrix-vector multiplications are implemented with minimal memory
storage. This fast block Hankel matrix randomized singular value decomposition algorithm is integrated
into the \texttt{Altproj} algorithm, which is a standard non-convex method for solving the robust
principal component analysis optimization problem. The improved algorithm avoids the construction
of the trajectory matrix. Hence, gravity and magnetic data matrices of large size can be computed.
Moreover, it is more efficient than the traditional low-rank matrix decomposition method, which
is based on the use of an inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm. The presented algorithm
is also robust and, hence, algorithm-dependent parameters are easily determined. The improved
and traditional algorithms are contrasted for the separation of synthetic gravity and magnetic
data matrices of different sizes. The presented results demonstrate that the improved algorithm
is not only computationally more efficient but it is also more accurate. Moreover, it is possible
to solve far larger problems. As an example, for the adopted computational environment, matrices
of sizes larger than $205 \times 205$ generate "out of memory" exceptions with the traditional method,
but a matrix of size $2001\times 2001$ can be calculated in $1062.29$s with the new algorithm. Finally,
the improved method is applied to separate real gravity and magnetic data in the Tongling area, Anhui
province, China. Areas which may exhibit mineralizations are inferred based on the separated anomalies.
