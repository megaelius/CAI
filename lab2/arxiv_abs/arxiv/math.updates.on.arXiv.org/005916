The Special Lagrangian Potential Equation for a function $u$ on a domain $\Omega\subset {\bf R}^n$
is given by ${\rm tr}\{\arctan(D^2 \,u) \} = \theta$ for a contant $\theta \in (-n {\pi\over 2}, n
{\pi\over 2})$. For $C^2$ solutions the graph of $Du$ in $\Omega\times {\bf R}^n$ is a special Lagrangian
submanfold. Much has been understood about the Dirichlet problem for this equation, but the existence
result relies on explicitly computing the associated boundary conditions (or, otherwise said,
computing the pseudo-convexity for the associated potential theory). This is done in this paper,
and the answer is interesting. The result carries over to many related equations -- for example,
those obtained by taking $\sum_k \arctan\, \lambda_k^{{\mathfrak g}} = \theta$ where ${{\mathfrak
g}} : {\rm Sym}^2({\bf R}^n)\to {\bf R}$ is a Garding-Dirichlet polynomial which is hyperbolic
with respect to the identity. A particular example of this is the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills
equation which appears in mirror symmetry. Another example is $\sum_j \arctan \kappa_j = \theta$
where $\kappa_1, ... , \kappa_n$ are the principal curvatures of the graph of $u$ in $\Omega\times
{\bf R}$. We also discuss the inhomogeneous Dirichlet Problem ${\rm tr}\{\arctan(D^2_x \,u)\}
= \psi(x)$ where $\psi : \overline{\Omega}\to (-n {\pi\over 2}, n {\pi\over 2})$. This equation
has the feature that the pull-back of $\psi$ to the Lagrangian submanifold $L\equiv {\rm graph}(Du)$
is the phase function $\theta$ of the tangent spaces of $L$. On $L$ it satisfies the equation $\nabla
\psi = -JH$ where $H$ is the mean curvature vector field of $L$.
