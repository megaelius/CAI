A compact metric measure space is a compact metric space equipped with probability measure that
has full support. Two such spaces are equivalent if they are isometric as metric spaces via an isometry
that maps the probability measure on the first space to the probability measure on the second. The
resulting set of equivalence classes can be metrized with the Gromov-Prohorov metric of Greven,
Pfaffelhuber and Winter. We consider the natural binary operation $\boxplus$ on this space that
takes two compact metric measure spaces and forms their Cartesian product equipped with the sum
of the two metrics and the product of the two probability measures. We show that the compact metric
measure spaces equipped with this operation form a cancellative, commutative, Polish semigroup
with a translation invariant metric and that each element has a unique factorization into prime
elements. We investigate the interaction between the semigroup structure and the natural action
of the positive real numbers on this space that arises from scaling the metric. For example, we show
that for any given positive real numbers $a,b,c$ the trivial space is the only space $\mathcal{X}$
that satisfies $a \mathcal{X} \boxplus b \mathcal{X} = c \mathcal{X}$. We establish that there
is no analogue of the law of large numbers: if $\mathbf{X}_1, \mathbf{X}_2, \ldots$ is an identically
distributed independent sequence of random spaces, then no subsequence of $\frac{1}{n} \boxplus_{k=1}^n
\mathbf{X}_k$ converges in distribution unless each $\mathbf{X}_k$ is almost surely equal to
the trivial space. We characterize the infinitely divisible probability measures and the L\'evy
processes on this semigroup, characterize the stable probability measures and establish a counterpart
of the LePage representation for the latter class.
