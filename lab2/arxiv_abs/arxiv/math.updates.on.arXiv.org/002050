PDE-constrained optimization problems find many applications in medical image analysis, for
example, neuroimaging, cardiovascular imaging, and oncological imaging. We review related literature
and give examples on the formulation, discretization, and numerical solution of PDE-constrained
optimization problems for medical imaging. We discuss three examples. The first one is image registration.
The second one is data assimilation for brain tumor patients, and the third one data assimilation
in cardiovascular imaging. The image registration problem is a classical task in medical image
analysis and seeks to find pointwise correspondences between two or more images. The data assimilation
problems use a PDE-constrained formulation to link a biophysical model to patient-specific data
obtained from medical images. The associated optimality systems turn out to be sets of nonlinear,
multicomponent PDEs that are challenging to solve in an efficient way. The ultimate goal of our work
is the design of inversion methods that integrate complementary data, and rigorously follow mathematical
and physical principles, in an attempt to support clinical decision making. This requires reliable,
high-fidelity algorithms with a short time-to-solution. This task is complicated by model and
data uncertainties, and by the fact that PDE-constrained optimization problems are ill-posed
in nature, and in general yield high-dimensional, severely ill-conditioned systems after discretization.
These features make regularization, effective preconditioners, and iterative solvers that,
in many cases, have to be implemented on distributed-memory architectures to be practical, a prerequisite.
We showcase state-of-the-art techniques in scientific computing to tackle these challenges.
