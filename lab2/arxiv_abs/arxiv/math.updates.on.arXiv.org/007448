The purpose of the article is to study the existence, regularity, stabilization and blow up results
of weak solution to the following parabolic $(p,q)$-singular equation: \begin{equation*} (P_t)\;
\left\{\begin{array}{rllll} u_t-\Delta_{p}u -\Delta_{q}u & = \vth \; u^{-\de}+ f(x,u), \; u>0
\text{ in } \Om\times (0,T), \\ u&=0 \quad \text{ on } \pa\Om\times (0,T), u(x,0)&= u_0(x) \; \text{
in }\Om, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Om$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$
with $C^2$ boundary $\pa\Om$, $1<q<p< \infty$, $0<\de, T>0$, $N\ge 2$ and $\vth>0$ is a parameter.
Moreover, we assume that $f:\Om\times [0,\infty) \to \mb R$ is a bounded below Carath\'eodory function,
locally Lipschitz with respect to the second variable uniformly in $x\in\Om$ and $u_0\in L^\infty(\Om)\cap
W^{1,p}_0(\Om)$. We distinguish the cases as $q$-subhomogeneous and $q$-superhomogeneous depending
on the growth of $f$ (hereafter we will drop the term $q$). In the subhomogeneous case, we prove the
existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to problem $(P_t)$ for $\de<2+1/(p-1)$. For this,
we first study the stationary problems corresponding to $(P_t)$ by using the method of sub and super
solutions and subsequently employing implicit Euler method, we obtain the existence of a solution
to $(P_t)$. Furthermore, in this case, we prove the stabilization result, that is, the solution
$u(t)$ of $(P_t)$ converges to $u_\infty$, the unique solution to the stationary problem, in $L^\infty(\Om)$
as $t\ra\infty$. For the superhomogeneous case, we prove the local existence theorem by taking
help of nonlinear semigroup theory. Subsequently, we prove finite time blow up of solution to problem
$(P_t)$ for small parameter $\vartheta>0$ in the case $\de\leq 1$ and for all $\vth>0$ in the case
$\de>1$.
