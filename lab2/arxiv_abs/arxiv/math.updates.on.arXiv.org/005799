For a Landau symmetry breaking transition in $(d+1)$-dimensional spacetime that completely breaks
a finite symmetry $G$, the critical point at the transition has the symmetry $G$. In this paper, we
show that the critical point also has a dual symmetry -- a $(d-1)$-symmetry described by higher group
when $G$ is Abelian or an algebraic $(d-1)$-symmetry beyond higher group when $G$ is non-Abelian.
In fact, when restricted to the symmetric sub-Hilbert space, any $G$-symmetric system can be regarded
as having a non-invertible gravitational anomaly, i.e. can be viewed as a boundary of $G$-gauge
theory in one higher dimension. The conservation of gauge charge and gauge flux in the bulk $G$-gauge
theory gives rise to the symmetry and dual symmetry respectively. So any $G$-symmetric system actually
has a larger symmetry called categorical symmetry, which is a combination of the symmetry and the
dual symmetry. However, part (but not all) of the categorical symmetry must be spontaneously broken
in any gapped phase of the system, but there exists a gapless state where the categorical symmetry
is not spontaneously broken. Such a gapless state corresponds to the usual critical point of Landau
symmetry breaking transition. The above results remain valid even if we expand the notion of symmetry
to include higher symmetries described by higher group and algebraic higher symmetries beyond
higher group. Thus our result also applies to critical points for transitions between topological
phases of matter. In particular, we show that there can be several critical points for the transition
from the 3+1D $Z_2$ gauge theory to a trivial phase. The critical point from Higgs condensation has
a categorical symmetry formed by a $Z_2$ 0-symmetry and a $Z_2$ 2-symmetry, while the critical point
of the confinement transition has a categorical symmetry formed by two $Z_2$ 1-symmetries.
