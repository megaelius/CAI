This paper is concerned with the approximation of tensors using tree-based tensor formats, which
are tensor networks whose graphs are dimension partition trees. We consider Hilbert tensor spaces
of multivariate functions defined on a product set equipped with a probability measure. This includes
the case of multidimensional arrays corresponding to finite product sets. We propose and analyse
an algorithm for the construction of an approximation using only point evaluations of a multivariate
function, or evaluations of some entries of a multidimensional array. The algorithm is a variant
of higher-order singular value decomposition which constructs a hierarchy of subspaces associated
with the different nodes of the tree and a corresponding hierarchy of interpolation operators.
Optimal subspaces are estimated using empirical principal component analysis of interpolations
of partial random evaluations of the function. The algorithm is able to provide an approximation
in any tree-based format with either a prescribed rank or a prescribed relative error, with a number
of evaluations of the order of the storage complexity of the approximation format. Under some assumptions
on the estimation of principal components, we prove that the algorithm provides either a quasi-optimal
approximation with a given rank, or an approximation satisfying the prescribed relative error,
up to constants depending on the tree and the properties of interpolation operators. The analysis
takes into account the discretization errors for the approximation of infinite-dimensional tensors.
Several numerical examples illustrate the main results and the behavior of the algorithm for the
approximation of high-dimensional functions using hierarchical Tucker or tensor train tensor
formats, and the approximation of univariate functions using tensorization.
