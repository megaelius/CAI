Emergent cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategies being proposed in the literature
for platoon formation in the Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) context mostly assume idealized
fixed information flow topologies (IFTs) for the platoon, implying guaranteed vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) communications for the IFT assumed. Since CACC strategies entail continuous information
broadcasting, communication failures can occur in congested CAV traffic networks, leading to
a platoon's IFT varying dynamically. To enhance the performance of CACC strategies, this study
proposes the idea of dynamically optimizing the IFT for CACC, labeled the CACC-OIFT strategy. Under
CACC-OIFT, the vehicles in the platoon cooperatively determine in real-time which vehicles will
dynamically deactivate or activate the "send" functionality of their V2V communication devices
to generate IFTs that optimize the platoon performance in terms of string stability under the ambient
traffic conditions. Given the adaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller with a two-predecessor-following
scheme, and the ambient traffic conditions and the platoon size just before the start of a time period,
the IFT optimization model determines the optimal IFT that maximizes the expected string stability.
The optimal IFT is deployed for that time period, and the adaptive PD controller continuously determines
the car-following behaviors of the vehicles based on the unfolding degeneration scenario for each
time instant within that period. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-OIFT is validated through
numerical experiments in NS-3 based on NGSIM field data. The results indicate that the proposed
CACC-OIFT can significantly enhance the string stability of platoon control in an unreliable V2V
communication context, outperforming CACCs with fixed IFTs or with passive adaptive schemes for
IFT dynamics.
