For $\mathfrak g$ a Kac-Moody algebra of affine type, we show that there is an $\text{Aut} \mathcal
O$-equivariant identification between $\text{FunOp}_{{}^L\!\mathfrak g}(D)$, the algebra
of functions on the space of ${{}^L\!\mathfrak g}$-opers on the disc, and $W\subset \pi_0$, the
kernel of screenings inside the Fock module for $\widehat{\mathfrak h}$, where $\mathfrak h\subset
\mathfrak g$ is the Cartan subalgebra. This kernel $W$ is generated by two states: a conformal vector,
and the state $\mathsf k_{-1}\left|0\right>$, where $\mathsf k$ spans the centre of $\mathfrak
g$. We show that $\mathsf k_{-1}\left|0\right>$ endows $\pi_0$ with a canonical notion of translation
$T$, and use it to define the densities in $\pi_0$ of integrals of motion of classical Conformal Affine
Toda (CAT) field theory. The $\text{Aut}\mathcal O$-action defines a bundle $\Pi$ over $\mathbb
P^1$ with fibre $\pi_0$. We show that the product bundles $\Pi \otimes \Omega^j$, where $\Omega^j$
are tensor powers of the canonical bundle, come endowed with a one-parameter family of holomorphic
connections, $\nabla - \alpha T$, $\alpha\in \mathbb C$. The integrals of motion of CAT define global
sections $[\mathbf v_j dt^{j+1} ] \in H^1(\mathbb P^1, \Pi\otimes \Omega^j,\nabla)$ of the de
Rham cohomology of $\nabla$. Any choice of ${{}^L\!\mathfrak g}$-Miura oper $\chi$ on $\mathbb
P^1$ gives a connection $\nabla_\chi$ on $\Omega^j$. Using coinvariants, we define a map $ F_\chi$
from sections of $\Pi \otimes \Omega^j$ to sections of $\Omega^j$. We show that $ F_\chi \nabla =
\nabla_\chi F_\chi$, so that $ F_\chi$ descends to a well-defined map of cohomologies. Under this
map, the classes $[\mathbf v_j dt^{j+1} ]$ are sent to the classes in $H^1(\mathbb P^1, \Omega^j,\nabla_\chi)$
defined by the ${{}^L\!\mathfrak g}$-oper on $\mathbb P^1$ underlying $\chi$.
