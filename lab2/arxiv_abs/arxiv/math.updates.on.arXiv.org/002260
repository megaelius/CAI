Research on asymptotic model selection in the context of stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
is almost non-existent in the literature. In particular, when a collection of SDEs is considered,
the problem of asymptotic model selection has not been hitherto investigated. Indeed, even though
the diffusion coefficients may be considered known, questions on appropriate choice of the drift
functions constitute a non-trivial model selection problem. In this article, we develop the asymptotic
theory for comparisons between collections of SDEs with respect to the choice of drift functions
using Bayes factors when the number of equations (individuals) in the collection of SDEs tend to
infinity while the time domains remain bounded for each equation. Our asymptotic theory covers
situations when the observed processes associated with the SDEs are independently and identically
distributed (iid), as well as when they are independently but not identically distributed (non-iid).
In particular, we allow incorporation of available time-dependent covariate information into
each SDE through a multiplicative factor of the drift function; we also permit different initial
values and domains of observations for the SDEs. Our model selection problem thus encompasses selection
of a set of appropriate time-dependent covariates from a set of available time-dependent covariates,
besides selection of the part of the drift function free of covariates. For both iid and non-iid set-ups
we establish almost sure exponential convergence of the Bayes factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate
with simulation studies that even in non-asymptotic scenarios Bayes factor successfully captures
the right set of covariates.
