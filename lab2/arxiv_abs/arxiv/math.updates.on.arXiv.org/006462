Filtered back projection (FBP) methods are the most widely used reconstruction algorithms in computerized
tomography (CT). The ill-posedness of this inverse problem allows only an approximate reconstruction
for given noisy data. Studying the resulting reconstruction error has been a most active field of
research in the 1990s and has recently been revived in terms of optimal filter design and estimating
the FBP approximation errors in general Sobolev spaces. However, the choice of Sobolev spaces is
suboptimal for characterizing typical CT reconstructions. A widely used model are sums of characteristic
functions, which are better modelled in terms of Besov spaces $\mathrm{B}^{\alpha,p}_q(\mathbb{R}^2)$.
In particular $\mathrm{B}^{\alpha,1}_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $\alpha \approx 1$ is a preferred
model in image analysis for describing natural images. In case of noisy Radon data the total FBP reconstruction
error $$\|f-f_L^\delta\| \le \|f-f_L\|+ \|f_L - f_L^\delta\|$$ splits into an approximation
error and a data error, where $L$ serves as regularization parameter. In this paper, we study the
approximation error of FBP reconstructions for target functions $f \in \mathrm{L}^1(\mathbb{R}^2)
\cap \mathrm{B}^{\alpha,p}_q(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with positive $\alpha \not\in \mathbb{N}$ and
$1 \leq p,q \leq \infty$. We prove that the $\mathrm{L}^p$-norm of the inherent FBP approximation
error $f-f_L$ can be bounded above by \begin{equation*} \|f - f_L\|_{\mathrm{L}^p(\mathbb{R}^2)}
\leq c_{\alpha,q,W} \, L^{-\alpha} \, |f|_{\mathrm{B}^{\alpha,p}_q(\mathbb{R}^2)} \end{equation*}
under suitable assumptions on the utilized low-pass filter's window function $W$. This then extends
by classical methods to estimates for the total reconstruction error.
