Consider a problem where a set of feasible observations are provided by an expert and an objective
function is defined that characterizes which of the observations dominate the others and are, hence,
preferable. However, the constraints that shape the feasible region of the problem are partially
or fully unknown. Our goal is to find a set of linear constraints that would render all the given observations
feasible while making the preferred observations optimal for the known objective function. Providing
such feasible regions (i) builds a baseline for categorizing future observations as feasible or
infeasible, and (ii) allow for sensitivity analyses to discern changes in optimal solutions if
the objective function coefficients changes. To this end, we propose a data-driven multi-point
inverse optimization framework for recovering the constraint set of a forward problem. We focus
on forward linear problems in which the objective function is known but the constraint matrix is
(partially) unknown. Our inverse framework recovers the entire constraint matrix such that all
past observations are feasible and the preferred observations become optimal or near-optimal.
We provide several generalized data-driven measure functions that can be used to find a desirable
shape of the feasible region, based on user preference and historical data. We propose solution
methodologies that allow us to solve the nonlinear non-convex problems to optimality using an equivalent
simpler model and also an iterative algorithm. We test our methodologies on two numerical examples
which provide insight into advantages and disadvantages of each measure function and guidelines
for deciding how to choose the appropriate one depending on the application.
