We study the general integer programming problem where the number of variables $n$ is a variable
part of the input. We consider two natural parameters of the constraint matrix $A$: its numeric measure
$a$ and its sparsity measure $d$. We show that integer programming can be solved in time $g(a,d)\textrm{poly}(n,L)$,
where $g$ is some computable function of the parameters $a$ and $d$, and $L$ is the binary encoding
length of the input. In particular, integer programming is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized
by $a$ and $d$, and is solvable in polynomial time for every fixed $a$ and $d$. Our results also extend
to nonlinear separable convex objective functions. Moreover, for linear objectives, we derive
a strongly-polynomial algorithm, that is, with running time $g(a,d)\textrm{poly}(n)$, independent
of the rest of the input data. We obtain these results by developing an algorithmic framework based
on the idea of iterative augmentation: starting from an initial feasible solution, we show how to
quickly find augmenting steps which rapidly converge to an optimum. A central notion in this framework
is the Graver basis of the matrix $A$, which constitutes a set of fundamental augmenting steps. The
iterative augmentation idea is then enhanced via the use of other techniques such as new and improved
bounds on the Graver basis, rapid solution of integer programs with bounded variables, proximity
theorems and a new proximity-scaling algorithm, the notion of a reduced objective function, and
others. As a consequence of our work, we advance the state of the art of solving block-structured
integer programs. In particular, we develop near-linear time algorithms for $n$-fold, tree-fold,
and $2$-stage stochastic integer programs. We also discuss some of the many applications of these
classes.
