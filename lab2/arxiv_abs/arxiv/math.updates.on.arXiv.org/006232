We discuss tipping phenomena in nonautonomous systems using an example of a bi-stable ecosystem
model with environmental changes represented by time-varying parameters [Scheffer et al. Ecosystems
11 2008]. We give simple testable criteria for the occurrence of nonautonomous tipping from the
herbivore-dominating equilibrium to the plant-only equilibrium using global properties of the
autonomous frozen system with fixed-in-time parameters. To begin with, we use classical autonomous
bifurcation analysis to identify a codimension-three degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation:
the source of a dangerous subcritical Hopf bifurcation and the organising centre for bifurcation-induced
tipping (B-tipping). Then, we introduce basin instability analysis to identify parameter paths
along which genuine nonautonomous rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs without crossing
any classical autonomous bifurcation. We explain nonautonomous R-tipping in terms of maximal
canard trajectories, and produce nonautonomous tipping diagrams in the plane of the magnitude
and rate of a parameter shift to uncover intriguing R-tipping tongues and wiggling tipping-tracking
bifurcation curves. Discussion of non-trivial dynamics arising from the interaction between
B-tipping and R-tipping identifies "points of no return" where tipping cannot be prevented by the
parameter trend reversal and "points of return tipping" where tipping is inadvertently induced
by the parameter trend reversal. Our results give new insight into the sensitivity of ecosystems
to the magnitudes and rates of environmental change. Finally, a comparison between 'tilted' saddle-node
and subcritical Hopf normal forms reveals some universal tipping properties due to basin instability,
a generic dangerous bifurcation, or the combination of both.
