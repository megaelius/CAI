The connections between algebraic geometry and mathematical logic are extremely important. This
short survey is related to ideas that contained in the well-known works of B. Plotkin and V. Remeslennikov
and their followers. We assume that lots of questions still require further illumination. One of
the goals of this paper is to narrow the gap and to draw attention to this topic. We start from a brief
review of the paper and motivations. First sections deal with model theory. In Section 2.1 we describe
the geometric equivalence, the elementary equivalence, and the isotypicity of algebras. We look
at these notions from the positions of universal algebraic geometry and make emphasis on the cases
of the first order rigidity. In this setting Plotkin's problem on the structure of automorphisms
of (auto)endomorphisms of free objects, and auto-equivalence of categories is pretty natural
and important. Section 2.2 is dedicated to particular cases of Plotkin's problem. Section 2.3 is
devoted to Plotkin's problem for automorphisms of the group of polynomial symplectomorphisms.
This setting has applications to mathematical physics through the use of model theory ( non-standard
analysis) in the studying of homomorphisms between groups of symplectomorphisms and automorphisms
of the Weyl algebra. The last two sections deal with algorithmic problems for noncommutative and
commutative algebraic geometry. Section 3.1 is devoted to the Gr\"obner basis in non-commutative
situation. Despite the existence of an algorithm for checking equalities, the zero divisors and
nilpotency problems are algorithmically unsolvable. Section 3.2 is connected with the problem
of embedding of algebraic varieties; a sketch of the proof of its algorithmic undecidability over
a field of characteristic zero is given.
