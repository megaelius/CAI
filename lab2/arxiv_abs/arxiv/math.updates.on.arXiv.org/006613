In this paper we work toward the HOMFLYPT skein module of $L(p, 1)$, $\mathcal{S}(L(p,1))$, via
braids. Our starting point is the linear Turaev-basis, $\Lambda^{\prime}$, of the HOMFLYPT skein
module of the solid torus ST, $\mathcal{S}({\rm ST})$, which can be decomposed as the tensor product
of the "positive" ${\Lambda^{\prime}}^+$ and the "negative" ${\Lambda^{\prime}}^-$ sub-modules,
and the Lambropoulou invariant, $X$, for knots and links in ST, that captures $S({\rm ST})$. It is
a well-known result by now that $\mathcal{S}(L(p, 1))=\frac{\mathcal{S}(ST)}{<bbm's>}$, where
bbm's (braid band moves) denotes the isotopy moves that correspond to the surgery description of
$L(p, 1)$. Namely, a HOMFLYPT-type invariant for knots and links in ST can be extended to an invariant
for knots and links in $L(p, 1)$ by imposing relations coming from the performance of bbm's and solving
the infinite system of equations obtained that way. \smallbreak In this paper we work with a new basis
of $\mathcal{S}({\rm ST})$, $\Lambda$, and we relate the infinite system of equations obtained
by performing bbm's on elements in $\Lambda^+$ to the infinite system of equations obtained by performing
bbm's on elements in $\Lambda^-$ via a map $I$. More precisely we prove that the solutions of one system
can be derived from the solutions of the other. Our aim is to reduce the complexity of the infinite
system one needs to solve in order to compute $\mathcal{S}(L(p,1))$ using the braid technique.
Finally, we present a generating set and a potential basis for $\frac{\Lambda^+}{<bbm's>}$ and
thus, we obtain a generating set and a potential basis for $\frac{\Lambda^-}{<bbm's>}$. We also
discuss further steps needed in order to compute $\mathcal{S}(L(p,1))$ via braids.
