In this paper (as in [Ken15]), we consider an effective version of the characterization of (separable
metric) spaces as zero-dimensional iff every nonempty closed subset is a retract of the space (actually,
we have proved a relative result for closed (zero-dimensional) subspaces of a fixed space). This
uses (in the converse direction) local compactness & bilocated sets as in [Ken15], but in the forward
direction the newer version has a simpler proof and no compactness assumption. Furthermore, the
proof of the forward implication relates to so-called Dugundji systems: we elaborate both a general
construction of such systems for a proper nonempty closed subspace (using a computable form of countable
paracompactness), and modifications to make the sets pairwise disjoint if the subspace is zero-dimensional,
or to avoid the restriction to proper subspaces. In a different direction, a second theorem applies
in $p$-adic analysis the ideas of the first theorem to compute a more general form of retraction,
given a Dugundji system (possibly without disjointness). Finally, we complement the mentioned
effective retract characterization of zero-dimensional subspaces by improving to equivalence
the implications (or Weihrauch reductions in some cases), for closed at-most-zero-dimensional
subsets with some negative information, among separate conditions of computability of operations
$N,M,B,S$ introduced in [Ken15,\S 4] and corresponding to vanishing large inductive dimension,
vanishing small inductive dimension, existence of a countable basis of relatively clopen sets,
and the reduction principle for sequences of open sets. Thus, similarly to the robust notion of effective
zero-dimensionality of computable metric spaces in [Ken15], there is a robust notion of `uniform
effective zero-dimensionality' for a represented pointclass consisting of at-most-zero-dimensional
closed subsets.
