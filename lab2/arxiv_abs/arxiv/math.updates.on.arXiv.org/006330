Hybrid terrestrial-satellite (HTS) communication systems have gained a tremendous amount of
interest recently due to the high demand for global high data rates. Conventional satellite communications
operate in the conventional Ku (12 GHz) and Ka (26.5-40 GHz) radio-frequency bands for assessing
the feeder link, between the ground gateway and the satellite. Nevertheless, with the aim to provide
hundreds of Mbps of throughput per each user, free-space optical (FSO) feeder links have been proposed
to fulfill these high data rates requirements. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer
security performance for a hybrid very high throughput satellite communication system with an
FSO feeder link. In particular, the satellite receives the incoming optical wave from an appropriate
optical ground station, carrying the data symbols of $N$ users through various optical apertures
and combines them using the selection combining technique. Henceforth, the decoded and regenerated
information signals of the $N$ users are zero-forcing (ZF) precoded in order to cancel the interbeam
interference at the end-users. The communication is performed under the presence of malicious
eavesdroppers nodes at both hops. Statistical properties of the signal-to-noise ratio of the legitimate
and wiretap links at each hop are derived, based on which the intercept probability metric is evaluated.
The derived results show that above a certain number of optical apertures, the secrecy level is not
improved further. Also, the system's secrecy is improved using ZF precoding compared to the no-precoding
scenario for some specific nodes' positions. All the derived analytical expressions are validated
through Monte Carlo simulations.
