In this study, a stochastic power management strategy for in-wheel motor electric vehicles (IWM-EV)
is proposed to reduce the energy consumption and increase the driving range by considering the unpredictable
nature of the driving power demand. A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) approach, policy iteration
algorithm, is used to create an infinite horizon problem formulation to calculate optimal power
distribution policies for the vehicle. The developed SDP strategy distributes the demanded power,
between the front and rear IWMs by considering states of the vehicle, including the vehicle speed
and the front and the rear wheels' slip ratios. In addition, a skid avoidance rule is added to the power
management strategy to maintain the wheels' slip ratios within the desired values. Undesirable
slip ratios cause poor brake and traction control performances and therefore should be avoided.
The resulting strategy consists of a time- invariant, rule-based controller which is fast enough
for real-time implementations, and additionally, it is not expensive to be launched since the future
power demand is approximated without a need to vehicle communication systems or telemetric capability.
A high-fidelity model of an IWM-EV is developed in the Autonomie/Simulink environment for evaluating
the proposed strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed SDP strategy is more efficient
in comparison to some benchmark strategies, such as an equal power distribution (ED) and generalized
rule- based dynamic programming (GRDP). The simulation results of different driving scenarios
for the considered IWM-EV shows the proposed power management strategy leads to considerable energy
consumption reduction in average, at no additional cost.
