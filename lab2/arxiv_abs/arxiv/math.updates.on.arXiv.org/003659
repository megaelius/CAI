We study effectively inseparable (e.i.) pre-lattices (i.e. structures of the form $L=\langle
\omega, \wedge, \lor, 0, 1, \leq_L\rangle$ where $\omega$ denotes the set of natural numbers and
the following hold: $\wedge, \lor$ are binary computable operations; $\leq_L$ is a c.e. pre-ordering
relation, with $0 \leq_{L} x \leq_{L} 1$ for every $x$; the equivalence relation $\equiv_L$ originated
by $\leq_L$ is a congruence on $L$ such that the corresponding quotient structure is a non-trivial
bounded lattice; the $\equiv_L$-equivalence classes of $0$ and $1$ form an effectively inseparable
pair), and show that if $L$ is an e.i. pre-lattice then $\le_{L}$ is universal with respect to all
c.e. pre-ordering relations, i.e. for every c.e. pre-ordering relation $R$ there exists a computable
function $f$ such that, for all $x,y$, $x \mathrel{R} y$ if and only if $f(x) \le_{L} f(y)$; in fact
$\leq_L$ is locally universal, i.e. for every pair $a<_{L} b$ and every c.e. pre ordering relation
$R$ one can find a reducing function $f$ from $R$ to $\le_{L}$ such that the range of $f$ is contained
in the interval $\{x: a \leq_{L} x \leq_{L} b\}$. Also $\leq_L$ is uniformly dense, i.e. there exists
a computable function $f$ such that for every $a,b$ if $a<_{L} b$ then $a<_{L} f(a,b) <_{L} b$, and
if $a\equiv_{L} a'$ and $b \equiv_{L} b'$ then $f(a,b)\equiv_{L} f(a',b')$. Some consequences
and applications of these results are discussed: in particular for $n \ge 1$ the c.e. pre-ordering
relation on $\Sigma_{n}$ sentences yielded by the relation of provable implication of any c.e.
consistent extension of Robinson's $Q$ or $R$ is locally universal and uniformly dense; and the
c.e. pre-ordering relation of provable implication of Heyting Arithmetic is locally universal
and uniformly dense.
