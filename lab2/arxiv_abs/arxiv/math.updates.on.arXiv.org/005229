We examine spectral operator-theoretic properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems
with globally stable attractors. Using the Kato Decomposition we develop a spectral expansion
for general linear autonomous dynamical systems with analytic observables, and define the notion
of generalized eigenfunctions of the associated Koopman operator. We interpret stable, unstable
and center subspaces in terms of zero level sets of generalized eigenfunctions. We then utilize
conjugacy properties of Koopman eigenfunctions and the new notion of open eigenfunctions - defined
on subsets of state space - to extend these results to nonlinear dynamical systems with an equilibrium.
We provide a characterization of (global) center manifolds, center-stable and center-unstable
manifolds in terms of joint zero level sets of families of Koopman operator eigenfunctions associated
with the nonlinear system.After defining a new class of Hilbert spaces, that capture the on and off
attractor properties of dissipative dynamics, and introduce the concept of Modulated Fock Spaces},
we develop spectral expansions for a class of dynamical systems possessing globally stable limit
cycles and limit tori, with observables that are square-integrable in on-attractor variables
and analytic in off-attractor variables. We discuss definitions of stable, unstable and global
center manifolds in such nonlinear systems with (quasi)-periodic attractors in terms of zero level
sets of Koopman operator eigenfunctions. We define the notion of isostables for a general class
of nonlinear systems. We provide a simple example of a measure-preserving system that is not chaotic
but has continuous spectrum, and discuss experimental observations of spectrum on such systems.
We define the coherent principal dimension for a class of datasets based on the lattice-type principal
spectrum of the associated Koopman operator.
