We introduce a framework for approximate dynamic programming that we apply to discrete time chains
on $\mathbb{Z}_+^d$ with countable action sets. Our approach is grounded in the approximation
of the (controlled) chain's generator by that of another Markov process. In simple terms, our approach
stipulates applying a second-order Taylor expansion to the value function to replace the Bellman
equation with one in continuous space and time where the transition matrix is reduced to its first
and second moments. In some cases, the resulting equation (which we label {\bf TCP}) can be interpreted
as corresponding to a Brownian control problem. When tractable, the TCP serves as a useful modeling
tool. More generally, the TCP is a starting point for approximation algorithms. We develop bounds
on the optimality gap---the sub-optimality introduced by using the control produced by the "Taylored"
equation. These bounds can be viewed as a conceptual underpinning, analytical rather than relying
on weak convergence arguments, for the good performance of controls derived from Brownian control
problems. We prove that, under suitable conditions and for suitably "large" initial states, (i)
the optimality gap is smaller than a $1-\alpha$ fraction of the optimal value, where $\alpha\in
(0,1)$ is the discount factor, and (ii) the gap can be further expressed as the infinite horizon discounted
value with a "lower-order" per period reward. Computationally, our framework leads to an "aggregation"
approach with performance guarantees. While the guarantees are grounded in PDE theory, the practical
use of this approach requires no knowledge of that theory.
