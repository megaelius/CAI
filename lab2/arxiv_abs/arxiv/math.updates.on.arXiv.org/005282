Future smart ocean applications require long distance and reliable communications to connect
underwater sensors/robots with remote surface base stations. It is challenging to achieve such
goal due to the harsh and dynamic underwater acoustic channel. While Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output
(MIMO) technique can enhance reliability and transmission range, it is difficult to place multiple
acoustic transducers on one single underwater device due to the large wavelength. Although the
cooperative MIMO technique that let multiple underwater devices form a virtual MIMO system could
solve the issue, it was impossible to synchronize the distributed underwater devices due to the
extremely large and dynamic propagation delay of acoustic waves. To this end, this paper proposes
an underwater cooperative MIMO communication mechanism, which is based on a hybrid acoustic and
Magnetic Induction (MI) technique. The inter-node synchronization problem can be perfectly solved
by using the MI technique so that the distributed acoustic transducers can cooperatively form narrow
beams for long distance underwater communications. The synchronization time and errors are significantly
reduced since MI has negligible signal propagation delays. To quantitatively analyze the improvement,
the closed-form expressions of the synchronization error, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), effective
communication time, and throughput of the proposed system are rigorously derived. The proposed
hybrid system is implemented in a software-defined testbed under the beamforming and space-time
coding scheme. Through both numerical analysis and real-world experiments, the paper shows that
the proposed hybrid cooperative MIMO mechanism achieves much lower bit error rate and synchronization
error than the conventional acoustic systems.
