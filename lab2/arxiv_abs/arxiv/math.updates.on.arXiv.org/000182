A new parallelized unsplit geometrical Volume of Fluid (VoF) algorithm with support for arbitrary
unstructured meshes and dynamic local Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), as well as for two and three
dimensional computation is developed. The geometrical VoF algorithm supports arbitrary unstructured
meshes in order to enable computations involving flow domains of arbitrary geometrical complexity.
The implementation of the method is done within the framework of the OpenFOAM library for Computational
Continuum Mechanics (CCM) using the C++ programming language with modern policy based design for
high program code modularity. The development of the geometrical VoF algorithm significantly
extends the method base of the OpenFOAM library by geometrical volumetric flux computation for
two-phase flow simulations. For the volume fraction advection, a novel unsplit geometrical algorithm
is developed, which inherently sustains volume conservation utilizing unique Lagrangian discrete
trajectories located in the mesh points. This practice completely eliminates the possibility
of an overlap between the flux polyhedra and hence significantly increases volume conservation.
A new efficient (quadratic convergent) and accurate iterative flux correction algorithm is developed,
which avoids topological changes of the flux polyhedra. Our geometrical VoF algorithm is dimension
agnostic, providing automatic support for both 2D and 3D computations, following the established
practice in OpenFOAM. The geometrical algorithm used for the volume fraction transport has been
extended to support dynamic local AMR available in OpenFOAM. Furthermore, the existing dynamic
mesh capability of OpenFOAM has been modified to support the geometrical mapping algorithm executed
as a part of the dynamic local AMR cycle. The method implementation is fully parallelized using the
domain decomposition approach.
