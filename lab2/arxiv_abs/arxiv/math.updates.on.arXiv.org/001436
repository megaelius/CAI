We introduce a general technique for proving estimates for certain random planar maps which belong
to the $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) universality class for $\gamma \in (0,2)$. The
family of random planar maps we consider are those which can be encoded by a two-dimensional random
walk with i.i.d. increments via a mating-of-trees bijection, and includes the uniform infinite
planar triangulation (UIPT; $\gamma=\sqrt{8/3}$); and planar maps weighted by the number of spanning
trees ($\gamma=\sqrt 2$), bipolar orientations ($\gamma=\sqrt{4/3}$) or Schnyder woods ($\gamma=1$)
they admit. Using our technique, we prove estimates for graph distances in the above family of random
planar maps. In particular, we obtain non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of
a graph distance ball consistent with the Watabiki (1993) prediction for the Hausdorff dimension
of $\gamma$-LQG and we establish the existence of an exponent for certain distances in the map. The
basic idea of our approach is to compare a given random planar map $M$ to a mated-CRT map---a random
planar map constructed from a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion---using a strong coupling
(Zaitsev, 1998) of the encoding walk for $M$ and the Brownian motion used to construct the mated-CRT
map. This allows us to deduce estimates for graph distances in $M$ from the estimates for graph distances
in the mated-CRT map which we proved (using continuum theory) in a previous work. In the special case
when $\gamma=\sqrt{8/3}$, we instead deduce estimates for the $\sqrt{8/3}$-mated-CRT map from
known results for the UIPT. The arguments of this paper do not directly use SLE/LQG, and can be read
without any knowledge of these objects.
