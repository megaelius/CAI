Random projections of high-dimensional random vectors are of interest in a range of fields including
asymptotic convex geometry and high-dimensional statistics. We consider the projection of an
$n$-dimensional random vector onto a random $k_n$-dimensional basis, $k_n \leq n$, drawn uniformly
from the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal $k_n$-frames in $\mathbb{R}^n$, in
three different asymptotic regimes as $n \rightarrow \infty$: "constant" ($k_n=k$), "sublinear"
($k_n \rightarrow \infty$ but $k_n/n \rightarrow 0$) and "linear" $k_n/n \rightarrow \lambda$
with $0 < \lambda \le 1$). When the sequence of random vectors satisfies a certain "asymptotic thin
shell" condition, we establish annealed large deviation principles (LDPs) for the corresponding
sequence of random projections in the constant regime, and for the sequence of empirical measures
of the coordinates of the random projections in the sublinear and linear regimes. We also establish
LDPs for certain $\ell_q^n$ norms of the random projections in these different regimes. Moreover,
we verify the aforementioned asymptotic thin shell condition for various sequences of random vectors
of interest, including those distributed according to a Gibbs measure with superquadratic interaction
potential. Our results serve to complement the central limit theorem for convex sets and related
results which are known to hold under a "thin shell'' condition. These results also substantially
extend existing large deviation results for random projections, which are first, restricted to
the setting of $\ell_p^n$ balls, and secondly, limited to univariate LDPs (i.e., in $\mathbb{R}$)
involving either the norm of a $k_n$-dimensional projection or the projection of $X^{(n)}$ onto
a random one-dimensional subspace.
