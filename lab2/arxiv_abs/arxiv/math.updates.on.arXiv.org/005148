The aim is formal principles of origin information and information process creating information
observer self-creating information in interactive observations. The interactive phenomenon
creates Yes-No actions of information Bits in its information observer. Information emerges from
interacting random field of Kolmogorov probabilities, which link Kolmogorov 0-1 law probabilities
and Bayesian probabilities observing Markov diffusion process by probabilistic 0-1 impulses.
Each No-0 action cuts maximum of impulse minimal entropy while following Yes-1 action transfers
maxim between impulses performing dual principle of converting process entropy to information.
Merging Yes-No actions generate microprocess within bordered impulse producing Bit with free
information when the microprocess probability approaches 1. Interacting bits memorize free information
which attracts multiple Bits moving macroprocess self joining triplet macrounits. Memorized
information binds reversible microprocess with irreversible macroprocess. The observation
converts cutting entropy to information macrounits. Macrounits logically self-organize information
networks encoding the units in geometrical structures enclosing triplet code. Multiple IN binds
their ending triplets enclosing observer information cognition and intelligence. The observer
cognition assembles common units through multiple attraction and resonances at forming IN triplet
hierarchy which accept only units that recognizes each IN node. Maximal number of accepted triplet
levels in multiple IN measures the observer maximum comparative information intelligence. The
observation process carries probabilistic and certain wave functions which self-organize the
space hierarchical structures. These information regularities create integral logic and intelligence
self-requesting needed information.
