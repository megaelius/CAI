Let $\mathbf{W}_1$ and $\mathbf{W}_2$ be independent $n\times n$ complex central Wishart matrices
with $m_1$ and $m_2$ degrees of freedom respectively. This paper is concerned with the extreme eigenvalue
distributions of double-Wishart matrices $(\mathbf{W}_1+\mathbf{W}_2)^{-1}\mathbf{W}_1$,
which are analogous to those of F matrices ${\bf W}_1 {\bf W}_2^{-1}$ and those of the Jacobi unitary
ensemble (JUE). Defining $\alpha_1=m_1-n$ and $\alpha_2=m_2-n$, we derive new exact distribution
formulas in terms of $(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)$-dimensional matrix determinants, with elements
involving derivatives of Legendre polynomials. This provides a convenient exact representation,
while facilitating a direct large-$n$ analysis with $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ fixed (i.e., under
the so-called "hard-edge" scaling limit); the analysis is based on new asymptotic properties of
Legendre polynomials and their relation with Bessel functions that are here established. Specifically,
we present limiting formulas for the smallest and largest eigenvalue distributions as $n \to \infty$
in terms of $\alpha_1$- and $\alpha_2$-dimensional determinants respectively, which agrees
with expectations from known universality results involving the JUE and the Laguerre unitary ensemble
(LUE). We also derive finite-$n$ corrections for the asymptotic extreme eigenvalue distributions
under hard-edge scaling, giving new insights on universality by comparing with corresponding
correction terms derived recently for the LUE. Our derivations are based on elementary algebraic
manipulations, differing from existing results on double-Wishart and related models which often
involve Fredholm determinants, Painlev\'e differential equations, or hypergeometric functions
of matrix arguments.
