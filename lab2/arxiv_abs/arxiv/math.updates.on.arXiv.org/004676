We argue that Robinson's hyperreals have just as much claim to applicability as the garden variety
reals. In a recent text, Easwaran and Towsner (ET) analyze the applicability of mathematical techniques
in the sciences, and introduce a distinction between techniques that are applicable and those that
are merely instrumental. Unfortunately the authors have not shown that their distinction is a clear
and fruitful one, as the examples they provide are superficial and unconvincing. Moreover, their
analysis is vitiated by a reliance on a naive version of object realism which has long been abandoned
by most philosophical realists in favor of truth-value realism. ET's argument against the applicability
of hyperreals based on automorphisms of hyperreal models involves massaging the evidence and is
similarly unconvincing. The purpose of the ET text is to argue that Robinson's infinitesimal analysis
is merely instrumental rather than applicable. Yet in spite of Robinson's techniques being applied
in physics, probability, and economics, ET don't bother to provide a meaningful analysis of even
a single case in which these techniques are used. Instead, ET produce page after page of speculations
mainly imitating Connesian chimera-type arguments `from first principles' against Robinson.
In an earlier paper Easwaran endorsed real applicability of the sigma-additivity of measures,
whereas the ET text rejects real applicability of the axiom of choice, voicing a preference for ZF.
Since it is consistent with ZF that the Lebesgue measure is not sigma-additive, Easwaran is thereby
walking back his earlier endorsement. We note a related inaccuracy in the textbook Measure Theory
by Paul Halmos.
