The market projection for Internet of Things (IoT) systems is appealing for the Power Line Communication
(PLC) technology. A massive growth and a pervasive presence of these IoT objects is expected in our
everyday life. About 20 billion of IoT devices are forecasted to be installed in the next two years.
PLC is a compelling technology that could become essential for certain IoT applications. For example,
sensor nodes and actuators used in the Smart Buildings domain can be connected through PLC. In this
case, the PLC network will work as a backbone for the in-building communication. PLC systems, in
this domain, will help to solve or reduce the overcrowded-spectrum problem, exploiting the existing
cable infrastructure. Narrow band (NB) PLC is probably the most suitable type of PLC technology
for IoT applications. The main reasons are: simple hardware, good coverage, appropriate bit-rate
and low cost. Nevertheless, to guarantee reliable connectivity further analysis and improvements
should be done. There are such as signal propagation discontinuities, high channel attenuation
and noise. Despite the fact that PLC noise is a well-known problem, it still poses several challenges
for this technology. This paper aims at adding some new consideration on this topic. This paper describes
new results on MC NB noise. The MC noise is measured between the Live-Protective Earth (L-PE) and
between Neutral-Protective Earth (N-PE) pairs (L-PE-N configuration), to exploit the symmetries
of the channel. The analysis in this paper considers the whole PLC NB frequency spectrum that ranges
from 3 kHz to 500 kHz. It considers the noise observed at the two output ports of a given outlet in an
in-building network with three conductors.
