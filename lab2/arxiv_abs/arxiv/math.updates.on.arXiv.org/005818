Market power behaviour often occurs in modern wholesale electricity markets. Mixed Complementarity
Problems (MCPs) have been typically used for computational modelling of market power when it is
characterised by an oligopoly with competitive fringe. However, such models can lead to myopic
and contradictory behaviour. Previous works in the literature have suggested using conjectural
variations to overcome this modelling issue. We first show however, that an oligopoly with competitive
fringe where all firms have investment decisions, will also lead to myopic and contradictory behaviour
when modelled using conjectural variations. Consequently, we develop an Equilibrium Problem
with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) to model such an electricity market structure. The EPEC models
two types of players: price-making firms, who have market power, and price-taking firms, who do
not. In addition to generation decisions, all firms have endogenous investment decisions for multiple
new generating technologies. The results indicate that, when modelling an oligopoly with a competitive
fringe and generation investment decisions, an EPEC model can represent a more realistic market
structure and overcome the myopic behaviour observed in MCPs. The EPEC considered found multiple
equilibria for investment decisions and firms' profits. However, market prices and consumer costs
were found to remain relatively constant across the equilibria. In addition, the model shows how
it may be optimal for price-making firms to occasionally sell some of their electricity below marginal
cost in order to de-incentivize price-taking firms from investing further into the market. Such
strategic behaviour would not be captured by MCP or cost-minimisation models.
