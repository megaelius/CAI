In 1973, J. Moser proposed that his Twist Theorem could be used to show that orbits of the outer billiards
map on a sufficiently smooth closed curve were always bounded. Five years later Moser asked the same
question for a convex polygon. In 1987 F. Vivaldi and A. Shaidenko showed that all orbits for a regular
polygon must be bounded. R. Schwartz recently showed that a quadrilateral known as a Penrose Kite
has unbounded orbits and he proposed that 'most' convex polygons support unbounded orbits. Except
for a few special cases, very little is known about the dynamics of the outer billiards map on regular
polygons. In this paper we present a unified approach to the analysis of regular polygons - using
the canonical 'resonances' which are shared by all regular N-gons. In the case of the regular pentagon
and regular octagon these resonances exist on all scales and the fractal structure is well documented,
but these are the only non-trivial cases that have been analyzed. We present a partial analysis of
the regular heptagon, but the limiting structure is poorly understood and this does not bode well
for the remaining regular polygons. The minimal polynomial for the vertices of a regular N-gon has
degree Phi(N)/2 where Phi is the Euler totient function, so N = 5, 7 and 11 are respectively quadratic,
cubic and quintic. In the words of R. Schwartz, "A case such as N = 11 seems beyond the reach of current
technology." Some of the graphics have embedded high-resolution versions so this file is about
38Mb in size. This file and a smaller version can be downloaded at dynamicsofpolygons.org. Just

contributions to both inner and outer billiards.
