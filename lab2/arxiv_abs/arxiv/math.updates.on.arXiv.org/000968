The present article is devoted to the construction of a unified formalism for Palatini and unimodular
gravity. The basic idea is to employ a relationship between unified formalism for a Griffiths variational
problem and its classical Lepage-equivalent variational problem. As a way to understand from an
intuitive viewpoint the Griffiths variational problem approach considered here, we may say the
variations of the Palatini Lagrangian are performed in such a way that the so called metricity condition,
i.e. (part of) the condition ensuring that the connection is the Levi-Civita connection for the
metric specified by the vielbein, is preserved. From the same perspective, the classical Lepage-equivalent
problem is a geometrical implementation of the Lagrange multipliers trick, so that the metricity
condition is incorporated directly into the Palatini Lagrangian. The main geometrical tools involved
in these constructions are canonical forms living on the first jet of the frame bundle for the spacetime
manifold $M$. These forms play an essential r\^ole in providing a global version of the Palatini
Lagrangian and expressing the metricity condition in an invariant form; with their help, it was
possible to formulate an unified formalism for Palatini gravity in a geometrical fashion. Moreover,
we were also able to find the associated equations of motion in invariant terms and, by using previous
results from the literature, to prove their involutivity. As a bonus, we showed how this construction
can be used to provide a unified formalism for the so called unimodular gravity by employing a reduction
of the structure group of the principal bundle $LM$ to the special linear group $SL\left(m\right),m=\mathop{\text{dim}}{M}$.
