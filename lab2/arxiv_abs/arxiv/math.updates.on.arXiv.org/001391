Partial differential equations (PDEs) are often dependent on input quantities which are inherently
uncertain. To quantify this uncertainty, these PDEs must be solved over a large ensemble of parameters.
Even for a single realization this can a computationally intensive process. In the case of flows
governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, an efficient method has been devised for computing an
ensemble of solutions. To further reduce the computational cost of this method, an ensemble proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) method was recently proposed. The main contribution of this work
is the introduction of POD spatial filtering for ensemble-POD methods. The POD spatial filter makes
possible the construction of the Leray ensemble-POD model, which is a regularized reduced order
model for the numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows. The Leray ensemble-POD model
employs the POD spatial filter to smooth (regularize) the convection term in the Navier-Stokes
equations and greatly diminishes the numerical inaccuracies produced by the ensemble-POD method
in the numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows. Specifically, for the numerical simulation
of a convection-dominated two-dimensional flow between two offset cylinders, we show that the
Leray ensemble-POD method yields accurate results, whereas the ensemble-POD is highly inaccurate.
The second contribution of this work is a new numerical discretization of the variable viscosity
ensemble algorithm in which the average viscosity is replaced with the maximum viscosity. It is
shown that this new numerical discretization is significantly more stable than those in current
use. Furthermore, error estimates for the novel Leray ensemble-POD algorithm with this new numerical
discretization are also proven.
