In complicated/nonlinear parametric models, it is generally hard to know whether the model parameters
are point identified. We provide computationally attractive procedures to construct confidence
sets (CSs) for identified sets of full parameters and of subvectors in models defined through a likelihood
or a vector of moment equalities or inequalities. These CSs are based on level sets of optimal sample
criterion functions (such as likelihood or optimally-weighted or continuously-updated GMM criterions).
The level sets are constructed using cutoffs that are computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
directly from the quasi-posterior distributions of the criterions. We establish new Bernstein-von
Mises (or Bayesian Wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributions of the quasi-likelihood
ratio (QLR) and profile QLR in partially-identified regular models and some non-regular models.
These results imply that our MC CSs have exact asymptotic frequentist coverage for identified sets
of full parameters and of subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and have valid but
potentially conservative coverage in models with reduced-form parameters on the boundary. Our
MC CSs for identified sets of subvectors are shown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with
singularities. We also provide results on uniform validity of our CSs over classes of DGPs that include
point and partially identified models. We demonstrate good finite-sample coverage properties
of our procedures in two simulation experiments. Finally, our procedures are applied to two non-trivial
empirical examples: an airline entry game and a model of trade flows.
