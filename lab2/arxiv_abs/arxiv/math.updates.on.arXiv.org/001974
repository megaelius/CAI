Inspired by general relativity, we develop a uniform scheme for long-range potential scattering
by introducing tortoise coordinates in scattering theory. In general relativity, the tortoise
coordinate transforms the Schwarzschild spacetime into a spacetime with a conformally flat subspacetime.
In this paper, we show that the tortoise coordinate can convert a long-range potential to a short-range
potential. In scattering theory, there is a uniform scheme for the short-range potential scattering,
but there is no uniform scheme for long-range potential scattering. The reason is that the scattering
boundary conditions for all short-range potentials are the same, but for different long-range
potentials are different. Concretely, the scattering boundary condition is determined by the
large-distance asymptotic behavior of wave functions. The large-distance asymptotic behaviors
of wave functions for all short-range potentials are the same, but for different long-range potentials
are different. Once a long-range potential is converted to a short-range potential by the tortoise
coordinate, similar to short-range potential scattering, a uniform scheme for longrange potential
scattering can be then established. Especially, an explicit expression of the scattering wave
function for a long-range potential scattering are presented, in which the scattering wave function
is represented by the tortoise coordinate and the scattering phase shift. It should be emphasized
that such a uniform scheme not only applies to scattering but also applies to potentials possessing
only bound states. Furthermore, in terms of tortoise coordinates, we suggest a classification
scheme for potentials. Finally, an interesting result found in the present paper is that there exists
a duality relation between tortoise coordinates and asymptotic wave functions of different potentials.
