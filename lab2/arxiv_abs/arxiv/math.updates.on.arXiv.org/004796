The description of number of dual (quasy)-exactly solvable models with its hidden symmetry algebra
has been given at different levels of analysis within the framework of generalized Kustaanheimo-Stiefel
(KS)-transformations. It's shown that N-dimensionall singular oscillator and (n+1)-dimensional
generalized MICZ-Kepler system are dual to each other and the duality transformation is the generalized
version of the KS transformation. The solvability of the Schrodinger equation of these problems
by the variables separation method is given in a double, spherical and parabolic coordinates. The
quadratic Hahn algebra QH(3) as a hidden symmetry remains unchanged with different decomposition
of the original real space ${\rm I \!R}^{N}$ into components in the framework of addition rule for
SU(1,1) algebra. Also the hidden symmetry algebra as Higgs/Hahn algebras is clearly shown by the
commutant approach in the sense of Howe duality. A dimensional reduction is carried out to a singular
oscillator of two dimensions where every variable is the n-dimensional hyper-radius r. The dual
connection with (N=2n)-dimensional singular oscillator and the (n+1) general MICZ-Kepler system
in the class of quasi-exact (QE) problems also are considered. The certain generalization both
of harmonic oscillator model by anisotropic and nonlinear inharmonic terms and its dual analog
is shown and analyzed in the framework of generalized KS transformations. The exact analytical
solutions of the Schrodinger equation for abovementioned problems for QE class are discused and
given for four series of dual quasi-exact solvable models. In particular, a comparison with similar
results in lower dimensions and its generalization are given.
