We provide a unified approach, via deformations of incidence algebras, to several important types
of representations with finiteness conditions, as well as the combinatorial algebras which produce
them. We show that over finite dimensional algebras, representations with finitely many orbits,
or finitely many invariant subspaces, or distributive coincide, and further coincide with thin
modules in the acyclic case. Incidence algebras produce examples of such modules, and we show that
algebras which are locally hereditary, and whose projective are distributive, or equivalently,
which have finitely many ideals, are precisely the deformations of incidence algebras, and they
are the finite dimensional algebra analogue of Pr${\rm \ddot{u}}$fer rings. New characterizations
of incidence algebras are obtained, such as they are exactly algebras which have a faithful thin
module. A main consequence is that "every thin module comes from an incidence algebra": if $V$ is
either a thin module over a finite dimensional algebra $A$, or $V$ is distributive and $A$ is acyclic,
then $A/{\rm ann}(V)$ is an incidence algebra and $V$ can be presented as its defining representation.
We classify thin/distributive modules, and respectively deformations, of incidence algebras
in terms of first and second cohomology of the simplicial realization of the poset. As a main application
we obtain a complete classification of thin modules over any finite dimensional algebra. Their
moduli spaces are multilinear varieties, and we show that any multilinear variety can be obtained
in this way. A few other applications, to Grothendieck rings of combinatorial algebras, to graphs
and their incidence matrices, to linear algebra (tori actions on matrices), and to a positive answer
to the "no-gap conjecture" of Ringel and Bongartz, in the distributive case, are given. Other results
in the literature are re-derived.
