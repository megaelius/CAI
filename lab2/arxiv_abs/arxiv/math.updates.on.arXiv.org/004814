A linear Lie rack structure on a finite dimensional vector space $V$ is a Lie rack operation $(x,y)\mapsto
x\rhd y$ pointed at the origin and such that for any $x$, the left translation $\mathrm{L}_x:y\mapsto
\mathrm{L}_x(y)= x\rhd y$ is linear. A linear Lie rack operation $\rhd$ is called analytic if for
any $x,y\in V$, \[ x\rhd y=y+\sum_{n=1}^\infty A_{n,1}(x,\ldots,x,y), \]where $A_{n,1}:V\times\ldots\times
V\Leftarrow V$ is an $n+1$-multilinear map symmetric in the $n$ first arguments. In this case, $A_{1,1}$
is exactly the left Leibniz product associated to $\rhd$. Any left Leibniz algebra $(\mathfrak{h},[\;,\;])$
has a canonical analytic linear Lie rack structure given by $x\stackrel{c}{\rhd} y=\exp(\mathrm{ad}_x)(y)$,
where $\mathrm{ad}_x(y)=[x,y]$. In this paper, we show that a sequence $(A_{n,1})_{n\geq1}$
of $n+1$-multilinear maps on a vector space $V$ defines an analytic linear Lie rack structure if
and only if $[\;,\;]:=A_{1,1}$ is a left Leibniz bracket, the $A_{n,1}$ are invariant for $(V,[\;,\;]:)$
and satisfy a sequence of multilinear equations. Some of these equations have a cohomological interpretation
and can be solved when the zero and the 1-cohomology of the left Leibniz algebra $(V,[\;,\;])$ are
trivial. On the other hand, given a left Leibniz algebra $(\mathfrak{h},[\;,\;])$, we show that
there is a large class of (analytic) linear Lie rack structures on $(\mathfrak{h},[\;,\;])$ which
can be built from the canonical one and invariant multilinear symmetric maps on $\mathfrak{h}$.
A left Leibniz algebra on which all the analytic linear Lie rack structures are build in this way will
be called rigid. We use our characterizations of analytic linear Lie rack structures to show that
$\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ are rigid. We conjecture that any simple
Lie algebra is rigid as a left Leibniz algebra.
