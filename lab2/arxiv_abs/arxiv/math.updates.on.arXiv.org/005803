In a 2019 paper, Barnard and Steinerberger show that for $f\in L^1(\mathbf{R})$, the following
autocorrelation inequality holds: \begin{equation*} \min_{0 \leq t \leq 1} \int_\mathbf{R}
f(x) f(x+t)\ \mathrm{d}x \ \leq\ 0.411 ||f||_{L^1}^2, \end{equation*} where the constant $0.411$
cannot be replaced by $0.37$. In addition to being interesting and important in their own right,
inequalities such as these have applications in additive combinatorics where some problems, such
as those of minimal difference basis, can be encapsulated by a convolution inequality similar to
the above integral. Barnard and Steinerberger suggest that future research may focus on the existence
of functions extremizing the above inequality (which is itself related to Brascamp-Lieb type inequalities).
We show that for $f$ to be extremal under the above, we must have \begin{equation*} \max_{x_1 \in
\mathbf{R} }\min_{0 \leq t \leq 1} \left[ f(x_1-t)+f(x_1+t) \right] \ \leq\ \min_{x_2 \in \mathbf{R}
} \max_{0 \leq t \leq 1} \left[ f(x_2-t)+f(x_2+t) \right] . \end{equation*} Our central technique
for deriving this result is local perturbation of $f$ to increase the value of the autocorrelation,
while leaving $||f||_{L^1}$ unchanged. These perturbation methods can be extended to examine
a more general notion of autocorrelation. Let $d,n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, $f \in L^1$, $A$ be a $d \times
n$ matrix with real entries and columns $a_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$, and $C$ be a constant. For a broad
class of matrices $A$, we prove necessary conditions for $f$ to extremize autocorrelation inequalities
of the form \begin{equation*} \min_{ \mathbf{t} \in [0,1]^d } \int_{\mathbf{R}} \prod_{i=1}^n\
f(x+ \mathbf{t} \cdot a_i)\ \mathrm{d}x\ \leq\ C ||f||_{L^1}^n. \end{equation*}
