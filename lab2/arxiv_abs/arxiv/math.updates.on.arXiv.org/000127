Linear Fractional Stable Motion (LFSM) of Hurst parameter $H$ and of stability parameter $\al$,
is one of the most classical extensions of the well-known Gaussian Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM),
to the setting of heavy-tailed stable distributions \cite{SamTaq,EmMa}. In order to overcome
some limitations of its areas of application, coming from stationarity of its increments as well
as constancy over time of its self-similarity exponent, Stoev and Taqqu introduced in \cite{stoev2004stochastic}
an extension of LFSM, called Linear Multifractional Stable Motion (LMSM), in which the Hurst parameter
becomes a function $H(\cdot)$ depending on the time variable $t$. Similarly to LFSM, the tail heaviness
of the marginal distributions of LMSM is determined by $\al$; also, under some conditions, its self-similarity
is governed by $H(\cdot)$ and its path roughness is closely related to $H(\cdot)-1/\al$. Namely,
it was shown in \cite{stoev2004stochastic} that $H(t_0)$ is the self-similarity exponent of LMSM
at a time $t_0\neq 0$; moreover, very recently, it was established in \cite{hamonier2012lmsm},
that the quantities $\min_{t\in I} H(t)-1/\al$, and $H(t_0)-1/\al$, are respectively the uniform
H\"older exponent of LMSM on a compact interval $I$, and its local H\"older exponent at $t_0$. The
main goal of our article, is to construct, using wavelet coefficients of LMSM, strongly consistent
(i.e. almost surely convergent) statistical estimators of $\min_{t\in I} H(t)$, $H(t_0)$, and
$\al$; our estimation results, are obtained when $\al\in (1,2)$, and, $H(\cdot)$ is a H\"older
function smooth enough, with values in a compact subinterval $[\underline{H},\bar{H}]$ of $(1/\al,1)$.
