In this paper we provide an algorithm for solving constrained composite primal-dual monotone inclusions,
i.e., monotone inclusions in which a priori information on primal-dual solutions is represented
via closed convex sets. The proposed algorithm incorporates a projection step onto the a priori
information sets and generalizes the method proposed in [V\~u, B.C.: A splitting algorithm for
dual monotone inclusions involving cocoercive operators. Adv. Comput. Math. 38, 667-681 (2013)].
Moreover, under the presence of strong monotonicity, we derive an accelerated scheme inspired
on [Chambolle, A.; Pock, T.: A first-order primal-dual algorithm for convex problems with applications
to imaging. J. Math. Imaging Vis. 40, 120-145 (2011)] applied to the more general context of constrained
monotone inclusions. In the particular case of convex optimization, our algorithm generalizes
the methods proposed in [Condat, L.: A primal-dual splitting method for convex optimization involving
lipschitzian, proximable and linear composite terms. J. Optim. Theory Appl. 158,460-479 (2013)]
allowing a priori information on solutions and we provide an accelerated scheme under strong convexity.
An application of our approach with a priori information is constrained convex optimization problems,
in which available primal-dual methods impose constraints via Lagrange multiplier updates, usually
leading to slow algorithms with unfeasible primal iterates. The proposed modification forces
primal iterates to satisfy a selection of constraints onto which we can project, obtaining a faster
method as numerical examples exhibit. The obtained results extend and improve several results
in the literature.
