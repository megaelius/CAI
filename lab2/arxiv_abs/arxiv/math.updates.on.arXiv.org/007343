Strongly nonlinear flows, which commonly arise in geophysical and engineering turbulence, are
characterized by persistent and intermittent energy transfer between various spatial and temporal
scales. These systems are difficult to model and analyze due to combination of high dimensionality
and uncertainty, and there has been much interest in obtaining reduced models, in the form of stochastic
closures, that can replicate their non-Gaussian statistics in many dimensions. Here, we propose
a data-driven framework to model stationary chaotic dynamical systems through nonlinear transformations
and a set of decoupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Specifically, we use optimal
transport to find a transformation from the distribution of time-series data to a multiplicative
reference probability measure such as the standard normal distribution. Then we find the set of
decoupled SDEs that admit the reference measure as the invariant measure, and also closely match
the spectrum of the transformed data. As such, this framework represents the chaotic time series
as the evolution of a stochastic system observed through the lens of a nonlinear map. We demonstrate
the application of this framework in Lorenz-96 system, a 10-dimensional model of high-Reynolds
cavity flow, and reanalysis climate data. These examples show that SDE models generated by this
framework can reproduce the non-Gaussian statistics of systems with moderate dimensions (e.g.
10 and more), and predict super-Gaussian tails that are not readily available from little training
data. These findings suggest that this class of models provide an efficient hypothesis space for
learning strongly nonlinear flows from small amounts of data.
