In a call center, staffing decisions must be made before the call arrival rate is known with certainty.
Then, once the arrival rate becomes known, the call center may be over-staffed, in which case staff
are being paid to be idle, or under-staffed, in which case many callers hang-up in the face of long
wait times. Firms that have chosen to keep their call center operations in-house can mitigate this
problem by co-sourcing; that is, by sometimes outsourcing calls. Then, the required staffing $N$
depends on how the firm chooses which calls to outsource in real-time, after the arrival rate realizes
and the call center operates as a $M/M/N+M$ queue with an outsourcing option. Our objective is to
find a joint policy for staffing and call outsourcing that minimizes the long run average cost of
this two-stage stochastic program when there is a linear staffing cost per unit time and linear costs
associated with abandonments and outsourcing. We propose a policy that uses a square-root safety
staffing rule, and outsources calls in accordance with a threshold rule that characterizes when
the system is "too crowded". Analytically, we establish that our proposed policy is asymptotically
optimal, as the mean arrival rate becomes large, when the level of uncertainty in the arrival rate
is of the same order as the inherent system fluctuations in the number of waiting customers for a known
arrival rate. Through an extensive numerical study, we establish that our policy is extremely robust.
In particular, our policy performs remarkably well over a wide range of parameters, and far beyond
where it is proved to be asymptotically optimal.
