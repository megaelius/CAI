Covering spaces of graphs have long been useful for studying expanders (as "graph lifts") and unique
games (as the "label-extended graph"). In this paper we advocate for the thesis that there is a much
deeper relationship between computational topology and the Unique Games Conjecture. Our starting
point is Linial's 2005 observation that the only known problems whose inapproximability is equivalent
to the Unique Games Conjecture - Unique Games and Max-2Lin - are instances of Maximum Section of a
Covering Space on graphs. We then observe that the reduction between these two problems (Khot-Kindler-Mossel-O'Donnell,
FOCS 2004; SICOMP, 2007) gives a well-defined map of covering spaces. We further prove that inapproximability
for Maximum Section of a Covering Space on (cell decompositions of) closed 2-manifolds is also equivalent
to the Unique Games Conjecture. This gives the first new "Unique Games-complete" problem in over
a decade. Our results partially settle an open question of Chen and Freedman (SODA 2010; Disc. Comput.
Geom., 2011) from computational topology, by showing that their question is almost equivalent
to the Unique Games Conjecture. (The main difference is that they ask for inapproximability over
$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, and we show Unique Games-completeness over $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$
for large $k$.) This equivalence comes from the fact that when the structure group $G$ of the covering
space is Abelian - or more generally for principal $G$-bundles - Maximum Section of a $G$-Covering
Space is the same as the well-studied problem of 1-Homology Localization. Although our most technically
demanding result is an application of Unique Games to computational topology, we hope that our observations
on the topological nature of the Unique Games Conjecture will lead to applications of algebraic
topology to the Unique Games Conjecture in the future.
