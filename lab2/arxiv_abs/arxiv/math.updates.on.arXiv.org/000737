This paper continues the Wu-Shamai-Verd\'u program [2] on characterizing the degrees of freedom
(DoF) of interference channels (ICs) through R\'enyi information dimension. Specifically, we
find a single-letter formula for the DoF of vector ICs, encompassing multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) ICs, time- and/or frequency-selective ICs, and combinations thereof, as well as scalar
ICs as considered in [2]. The DoF-formula we obtain lower-bounds the DoF of all channels---with
respect to the choice of the channel matrix---and upper-bounds the DoF of almost all channels. It
applies to a large class of noise distributions, and its proof is based on an extension of a result
by Guionnet and Shlyakthenko [3] to the vector case in combination with the Ruzsa triangle inequality
for differential entropy introduced by Kontoyiannis and Madiman [4]. As in scalar ICs, achieving
full DoF requires the use of singular input distributions. Strikingly, in the vector case it suffices
to enforce singularity on the joint distribution of each individual transmit vector. This can be
realized through signaling in subspaces of the ambient signal space, which is in accordance with
the idea of interference alignment, and, most importantly, allows the scalar entries of the transmit
vectors to have non-singular distributions. The DoF-formula for vector ICs we obtain enables a
unified treatment of "classical" interference alignment \`a la Cadambe and Jafar [5], and Maddah-Ali
et al. [6], and the number-theoretic schemes proposed in [7], [8]. Moreover, it allows to calculate
the DoF achieved by new signaling schemes for vector ICs. We furthermore recover the result by Cadambe
and Jafar on the non-separability of parallel ICs [9] and we show that almost all parallel ICs are
separable in terms of DoF. Finally, our results apply to complex vector ICs, thereby extending the
main findings of [2] to the complex case.
