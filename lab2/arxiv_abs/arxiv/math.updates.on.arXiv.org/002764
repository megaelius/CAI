We develop a generic spacetime model in General Relativity which can be used to build any gravitational
model within General Relativity. The generic model uses two types of assumptions: (a) Geometric
assumptions additional to the inherent geometric identities of the Riemannian geometry of spacetime
and (b) Assumptions defining a class of observers by means of their 4-velocity $u^{a}$ which is a
unit timelike vector field. The geometric assumptions as a rule concern symmetry assumptions (the
so called collineations). The latter introduces the 1+3 decomposition of tensor fields in spacetime.
The 1+3 decomposition results in two major results. The 1+3 decomposition of $u_{a;b}$ defines
the kinematic variables of the model (expansion, rotation, shear and 4-acceleration) and defines
the kinematics of the gravitational model. The 1+3 decomposition of the energy momentum tensor
representing all gravitating matter introduces the dynamic variables of the model (energy density,
the isotropic pressure, the momentum transfer or heat flux vector and the traceless tensor of the
anisotropic pressure) as measured by the defined observers and define the dynamics of he model.
The symmetries assumed by the model act as constraints on both the kinematical and the dynamical
variables of the model. As a second further development of the generic model we assume that in addition
to the 4-velocity of the observers $u_{a}$ there exists a second universal vector field $n_{a}$
in spacetime so that one has a so called double congruence $(u_{a},n_{a})$ which can be used to define
the 1+1+2 decomposition of tensor fields. The 1+1+2 decomposition leads to an extended kinematics
concerning both fields building the double congruence and to a finer dynamics involving more physical
variables.
