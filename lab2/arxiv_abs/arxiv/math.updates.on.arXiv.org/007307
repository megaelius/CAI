This dissertation surveys several topics in the general areas of iterated forcing, infinite combinatorics
and set theory of the reals. There are two parts. In the first half I consider alternative versions
of the Cicho\'n diagram. First I show that for a wide variety of reduction concepts there is a Cicho\'n
diagram for effective cardinal characteristics relativized to that reduction. As an application
I investigate in detail the Cicho\'n diagram for degrees of constructibility relative to a fixed
inner model of ZFC. Then I study generalizations of cardinal characteristics to the space of functions
$f:\omega^\omega \to \omega^\omega$. I prove that these cardinals can be organized into two diagrams
analogous to the standard Cicho\'n diagram, prove several independence results and investigate
the relation between these cardinals and the standard cardinal invariants on omega. In the second
half of the thesis I look at forcing axioms compatible with CH. First I consider Jensen's subcomplete
and subproper forcing. I generalize these notions to larger classes which are (apparently) much
more nicely behaved structurally. I prove iteration and preservation theorems for both classes
and use these to produce many new models of the subcomplete forcing axiom. Finally I deal with dee-complete
forcing and its associated axiom DCFA. Extending a well-known result of Shelah, I show that if a tree
of height $\omega_1$ with no branch can be embedded into an $\omega_1$-tree, possibly with uncountable
branches, then it can be specialized without adding reals. As a consequence I give a fleshed out proof
that DCFA implies there are no Kurepa trees, even if CH fails.
