In the past fifteen years, the enumeration of lattice walks with steps takenin a prescribed set S
and confined to a given cone, especially the firstquadrant of the plane, has been intensely studied.
As a result, the generating functions ofquadrant walks are now well-understood, provided the allowed
steps aresmall, that is $S \subset \{-1, 0,1\}^2$. In particular, having smallsteps is crucial
for the definition of a certain group of bi-rationaltransformations of the plane. It has been proved
that this group is finite ifand only if the corresponding generating function is D-finite (that
is, it satisfies a lineardifferential equation with polynomial coefficients). This group is also
thekey to the uniform solution of 19 of the 23 small step models possessing afinite group.In contrast,
almost nothing is known for walks with arbitrary steps. In thispaper, we extend the definition of
the group, or rather of the associatedorbit, to this general case, and generalize the above uniform
solution ofsmall step models. When this approach works, it invariably yields a D-finitegenerating
function. We apply it to many quadrant problems, including some infinite families.After developing
the general theory, we consider the $13\ 110$ two-dimensionalmodels with steps in $\{-2,-1,0,1\}^2$
having at least one $-2$ coordinate. Weprove that only 240 of them have a finite orbit, and solve 231
of them withour method. The 9 remaining models are the counterparts of the 4 models of thesmall step
case that resist the uniform solution method (and which are knownto have an algebraic generating
function). We conjecture D-finiteness for their generatingfunctions, but only two of them are
likely to be algebraic. We also provenon-D-finiteness for the $12\ 870$ models with an infinite
orbit, except for16 of them.
