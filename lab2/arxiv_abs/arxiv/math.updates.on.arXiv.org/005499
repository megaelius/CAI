Over the last decades, the total variation (TV) evolved to one of the most broadly-used regularisation
functionals for inverse problems, in particular for imaging applications. When first introduced
as a regulariser, higher-order generalisations of TV were soon proposed and studied with increasing
interest, which led to a variety of different approaches being available today. We review several
of these approaches, discussing aspects ranging from functional-analytic foundations to regularisation
theory for linear inverse problems in Banach space, and provide a unified framework concerning
well-posedness and convergence for vanishing noise level for respective Tikhonov regularisation.
This includes general higher orders of TV, additive and infimal-convolution multi-order total
variation, total generalised variation (TGV), and beyond. Further, numerical optimisation algorithms
are developed and discussed that are suitable for solving the Tikhonov minimisation problem for
all presented models. Focus is laid in particular on covering the whole pipeline starting at the
discretisation of the problem and ending at concrete, implementable iterative procedures. A major
part of this review is finally concerned with presenting examples and applications where higher-order
TV approaches turned out to be beneficial. These applications range from classical inverse problems
in imaging such as denoising, deconvolution, compressed sensing, optical-flow estimation and
decompression, to image reconstruction in medical imaging and beyond, including magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), magnetic-resonance positron emission tomography (MR-PET),
and electron tomography.
