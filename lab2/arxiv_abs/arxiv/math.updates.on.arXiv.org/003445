In the past few years, new approaches to radar signal processing have been introduced which allow
the radar to perform signal detection and parameter estimation from much fewer measurements than
that required by Nyquist sampling. These systems - referred to as sub-Nyquist radars - model the
received signal as having finite rate of innovation and employ the Xampling framework to obtain
low-rate samples of the signal. Sub-Nyquist radars exploit the fact that the target scene is sparse
facilitating the use of compressed sensing (CS) methods in signal recovery. In this chapter, we
review several pulse-Doppler radar systems based on these principles. Contrary to other CS-based
designs, our formulations directly address the reduced-rate analog sampling in space and time,
avoid a prohibitive dictionary size, and are robust to noise and clutter. We begin by introducing
temporal sub-Nyquist processing for estimating the target locations using less bandwidth than
conventional systems. This paves the way to cognitive radars which share their transmit spectrum
with other communication services, thereby providing a robust solution for coexistence in spectrally
crowded environments. Next, without impairing Doppler resolution, we reduce the dwell time by
transmitting interleaved radar pulses in a scarce manner within a coherent processing interval
or "slow time". Then, we consider multiple-input-multiple-output array radars and demonstrate
spatial sub-Nyquist processing which allows the use of few antenna elements without degradation
in angular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate application of sub-Nyquist and cognitive radars
to imaging systems such as synthetic aperture radar. For each setting, we present a state-of-the-art
hardware prototype designed to demonstrate the real-time feasibility of sub-Nyquist radars.
