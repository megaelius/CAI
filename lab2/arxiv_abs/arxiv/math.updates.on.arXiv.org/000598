Given a family of complex varieties degenerating over a punctured disc, one is interested in computing
the induced action of monodromy on the cohomology of a fiber. In particular, one would like to compute
the equivariant refined limit mixed Hodge numbers associated to the degeneration, which contain
information about the induced variation of mixed Hodge structure, and, consequently, the induced
monodromy map. The motivic nearby fiber of the degeneration is an invariant introduced by Denef
and Loeser that specializes to give information about the associated equivariant limit mixed Hodge
numbers, themselves a specialization of the equivariant refined limit mixed Hodge numbers. Our
first main result states that the motivic nearby fiber of any degeneration can be computed concretely
using tropical geometry. Using a weighted version of Ehrhart theory previously introduced by the
author, our second main result consists of combinatorial formulas for the equivariant refined
limit mixed Hodge numbers in the case of degenerating families of hypersurfaces. These results
extend work of Eric Katz and the author to the equivariant setting. As an application, for a complex
polynomial that is convenient and satisfies a certain non-degeneracy condition, we present the
first combinatorial formulas for both the equivariant limit mixed Hodge numbers associated to
the action of monodromy at infinity, and the equivariant mixed Hodge numbers associated to the action
of monodromy on the cohomology of the Milnor fiber. As a consequence, one deduces combinatorial
formulas for the associated Jordan block structures. The latter results extend work of Matsui and
Takeuchi, Libgober and Sperber, Varchenko, Danilov, Tanab\'e, Kouchnirenko, and van Doorn and
Steenbrink.
