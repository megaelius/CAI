We perform an investigation on the interplay between (generalized) complete elliptic integrals,
Fourier-Legendre series expansions and hypergeometric ${}_3 F_2$ functions with quarter integer
parameters. We mainly focus on objects with one of the following structures: $$ \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{\binom{2n}{n}^2}{16^n}\,w(n),\qquad
\sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{\binom{4n}{2n}\binom{2n}{n}}{64^n}\,w(n) $$ with $w(n)$ being a meromorphic
function with a simple partial fraction decomposition. These series are related with Legendre
functions $P_{-1/2}$ and $P_{-1/4}$ and the the complete elliptic integral of the first kind $\mathbf{K}(x)$.
Given the generating function for shifted Legendre polynomials, we will prove the following results:
(Section 1) There are at least two different algorithmic approaches for the explicit evaluation
of some hypergeometric functions with quarter integer parameters, the former based on elementary
integrals, the latter on the computation of residues; (Sections 2,3,4) The generalized complete
elliptic integrals $\mathfrak{J_m}$ belong to the class of interesting functions having both
a hypergeometric Taylor series at the origin and a Fourier-Legendre expansion with a hypergeometric
structure. In particular the moments $\int_{0}^{1}x^\eta \mathfrak{J}_m(x)\,dx$ admit multiple
representations as ${}_3 F_2$ functions. This observation also leads to multiple representations
of $\pi$ as a ratio of ${}_3 F_2$ functions. From the Fourier-Legendre expansions of $x^\eta$ and
similar functions it is possible to derive closed forms for some hypergeometric functions, only
depending on values of the $\Gamma$ function. Besides these main results, we will also outline some
applications of our methods for the explicit evaluation of hypergeometric functions of the ${}_4
F_3(z)$ or ${}_5 F_4(z)$ kind at $z\in\{-1,\frac{1}{2},1\}$.
