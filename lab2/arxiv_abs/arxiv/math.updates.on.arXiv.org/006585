In this paper we extend the traditional framework of noncommutative geometry in order to deal with
spectral truncations of geometric spaces (i.e. imposing an ultraviolet cutoff in momentum space)
and with tolerance relations which provide a coarse grain approximation of geometric spaces at
a finite resolution. In our new approach the traditional role played by $C^*$-algebras is taken
over by operator systems. As part of the techniques we treat $C^*$-envelopes, dual operator systems
and stable equivalence. We define a propagation number for operator systems, which we show to be
an invariant under stable equivalence and use to compare approximations of the same space. We illustrate
our methods for concrete examples obtained by spectral truncations of the circle. These are operator
systems of finite-dimensional Toeplitz matrices and their dual operator systems which are given
by functions in the group algebra on the integers with support in a fixed interval. It turns out that
the cones of positive elements and the pure state spaces for these operator systems possess a very
rich structure which we analyze including for the algebraic geometry of the boundary of the positive
cone and the metric aspect i.e. the distance on the state space associated to the Dirac operator.
The main property of the spectral truncation is that it keeps the isometry group intact. In contrast,
if one considers the other finite approximation provided by circulant matrices the isometry group
becomes discrete, even though in this case the operator system is a $C^*$-algebra. We analyze this
in the context of the finite Fourier transform. The extension of noncommutative geometry to operator
systems allows one to deal with metric spaces up to finite resolution by considering the relation
$d(x,y)<\epsilon$ between two points, or more generally a tolerance relation which naturally
gives rise to an operator system.
