We study the Gibbs statistics of high-density hard-core configurations on a unit square lattice
$\mathbb{Z}^2$, for a general hard-core exclusion distance $D$. By using Delaunay triangulations,
we describe the periodic ground states in terms of non-obtuse $\mathbb{Z}^2$-triangles of a minimal
area under the constraint that the side-lengths are $\geq D$. The whole collection of values of $D$
is divided into three classes. One class (which we conjecture to be finite) is formed by values of
$D$ which generate {\it sliding}, a phenomenon leading to countable families of periodic ground
states. Each of the two remaining classes is proven to be infinite; they are characterized by, respectively,
uniqueness and non-uniqueness property of the minimal triangle up to $\mathbb{Z}^2$-congruencies.
For the class with uniqueness (Class A) we describe the periodic ground states via the admissible
sub-lattices $\mathbb{E}\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$ of maximum density. This allows us to identify
the extreme Gibbs measures (pure phases) for large values of fugacity and describe symmetries between
them. This establishes the phase diagram demonstrating a phase transition of the first order. We
then analyze the situation of non-uniqueness for values of $D$ in absence of {\it sliding} (Class
B). The character of non-uniqueness is twofold: there may be minimizing $\mathbb{Z}^2$-triangles
with different collections of side lengths (Class B1) or with the same collection but different
implementations (Class B0). In both uniqueness and non-uniqueness cases the results are obtained
by applying the Pirogov--Sinai theory, for which we establish a suitable Peierls bound based on
an appropriate definition of a contour. A large part of this work is a detailed study of the above uniqueness
and non-uniqueness properties for minimal-area $\mathbb{Z}^2$-triangles.
