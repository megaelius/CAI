While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life in today's ever-connected
world, social distancing has recently received much public attention on its importance since the
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature
among solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or slowing down the
spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social distancing problem for how a population,
when in a world with a network of social sites, such as schools, restaurants, shopping centers, residential
areas, etc., decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing down others so that the
social contacts across the network can be minimized. We model this problem as a network population
game, where every individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize
all his/her contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be found for every one, when the resulting
distribution of the population over the network reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large class
of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of network sites that forms a so-called
maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types, such as the
maximal independent set (r=0), the maximal strong matching (r=1), the maximal set of independent
cycles (r=2), etc. They are easy to identify or construct, and can be completely disconnected (with
r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more
flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and analyze their
rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular subnetworks. We provide an overview on
algorithms that can be used for computing maximal r-regular subnetworks and their associated distancing
strategies.
