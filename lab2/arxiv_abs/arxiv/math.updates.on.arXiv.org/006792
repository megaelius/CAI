In this paper, we introduce a new class of decision rules, referred to as Constant Depth Decision
Rules (CDDRs), for multistage optimization under linear constraints with uncertainty-affected
right-hand sides. We consider two uncertainty classes: discrete uncertainties which can take
at each stage at most a fixed number d of different values, and polytopic uncertainties which, at
each stage, are elements of a convex hull of at most d points. Given the depth mu of the decision rule,
the decision at stage t is expressed as the sum of t functions of mu consecutive values of the underlying
uncertain parameters. These functions are arbitrary in the case of discrete uncertainties and
are poly-affine in the case of polytopic uncertainties. For these uncertainty classes, we show
that when the uncertain right-hand sides of the constraints of the multistage problem are of the
same additive structure as the decision rules, these constraints can be reformulated as a system
of linear inequality constraints where the numbers of variables and constraints is O(1)(n+m)d^mu
N^2 with n the maximal dimension of control variables, m the maximal number of inequality constraints
at each stage, and N the number of stages. As an illustration, we discuss an application of the proposed
approach to a Multistage Stochastic Program arising in the problem of hydro-thermal production
planning with interstage dependent inflows. For problems with a small number of stages, we present
the results of a numerical study in which optimal CDDRs show similar performance, in terms of optimization
objective, to that of Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) policies, often at much smaller
computational cost.
