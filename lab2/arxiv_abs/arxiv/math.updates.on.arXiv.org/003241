We consider a stochastic model for evolution of group-structured populations in which interactions
between group members correspond to the Prisoner's Dilemma or the Hawk-Dove game. Selection operates
at two organization levels: individuals compete with peer group members based on individual payoff,
while groups also compete with other groups based on average payoff of group members. In the Prisoner's
Dilemma, this creates a tension between the two levels of selection, as defectors are favored at
the individual level, whereas groups with at least some cooperators outperform groups of defectors
at the between-group level. In the limit of infinite group size and infinite number of groups, we
derive a non-local PDE that describes the probability distribution of group compositions in the
population. For special families of payoff matrices, we characterize the long-time behavior of
solutions of our equation, finding a threshold level of between-group selection required to sustain
density steady states and the survival of cooperation. When all-cooperator groups are most fit,
the average and most abundant group composition at steady state range from featuring all-defector
groups when individual-level selection dominates to featuring all-cooperator groups when group-level
selection dominates. When the most fit groups have a mix of cooperators and defectors, then the average
and most abundant group compositions always feature a smaller fraction of cooperators than required
for the optimal mix, even in the limit where group-level selection is infinitely stronger than individual-level
selection. In such cases, the conflict between the two levels of selection cannot be decoupled,
and cooperation cannot be sustained at all in the case when between-group competition favors an
even mix of cooperators and defectors.
