In standard models of cardiac electrophysiology, including the bidomain and monodomain models,
local perturbations can propagate at infinite speed. We address this unrealistic property by developing
a hyperbolic bidomain model that is based on a generalization of Ohm's law with a Cattaneo-type model
for the fluxes. Further, we obtain a hyperbolic monodomain model in the case that the intracellular
and extracellular conductivity tensors have the same anisotropy ratio. In one spatial dimension,
the hyperbolic monodomain model is equivalent to a cable model that includes axial inductances,
and the relaxation times of the Cattaneo fluxes are strictly related to these inductances. A purely
linear analysis shows that the inductances are negligible, but models of cardiac electrophysiology
are highly nonlinear, and linear predictions may not capture the fully nonlinear dynamics. In fact,
contrary to the linear analysis, we show that for simple nonlinear ionic models, an increase in conduction
velocity is obtained for small and moderate values of the relaxation time. A similar behavior is
also demonstrated with biophysically detailed ionic models. Using the Fenton-Karma model along
with a low-order finite element spatial discretization, we numerically analyze differences between
the standard monodomain model and the hyperbolic monodomain model. In a simple benchmark test,
we show that the propagation of the action potential is strongly influenced by the alignment of the
fibers with respect to the mesh in both the parabolic and hyperbolic models when using relatively
coarse spatial discretizations. Accurate predictions of the conduction velocity require computational
mesh spacings on the order of a single cardiac cell. We also compare the two formulations in the case
of spiral break up and atrial fibrillation in an anatomically detailed model of the left atrium,
and [...].
