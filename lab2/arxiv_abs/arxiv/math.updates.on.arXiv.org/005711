Quantum computing (QC) architectures utilizing classical or coherent resources with Gaussian
transformations are classically simulable as an indicator of the lack of QC power. Simple optical
set-ups utilizing wave-particle duality and interferometers achieve QC speed-up with the cost
of exponential complexity of resources in time, space or energy. However, linear optical networks
composed of single photon inputs and photon number measurements such as boson sampling achieve
solving problems which are not efficiently solvable by classical computers while emphasizing
the power of linear optics. In this article, quantum path computing (QPC) set-up is introduced as
the simplest optical QC satisfying five fundamental properties all-in-one: exploiting only the
coherent sources being either fermion or boson, i.e., Gaussian wave packet of standard laser, simple
set-up of multiple plane diffraction (MPD) with multiple slits by creating distinct propagation
paths, standard intensity measurement on the detector, energy efficient design and practical
problem solving capability. MPD is unique with non-Gaussian transformations by realizing an exponentially
increasing number of highly interfering propagation paths while making classical simulation
significantly hard. It does not require single photon resources or number resolving detection
mechanisms making the experimental implementation of QC significantly low complexity. QPC set-up
is utilized for the solutions of specific instances of two practical and hard number theoretical
problems: partial sum of Riemann theta function and period finding to solve Diophantine approximation.
Quantumness of MPD with negative volume of Wigner function is numerically analyzed and open issues
for the best utilization of QPC are discussed.
