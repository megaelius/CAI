In this paper, we study the mathematical structure and numerical approximation of elliptic problems
posed in a (3D) domain $\Omega$ when the right-hand side is a (1D) line source $\Lambda$. The analysis
and approximation of such problems is known to be non-standard as the line source causes the solution
to be singular. Our main result is a splitting theorem for the solution; we show that the solution
admits a split into an explicit, low regularity term capturing the singularity, and a high-regularity
correction term $w$ being the solution of a suitable elliptic equation. The splitting theorem states
the mathematical structure of the solution; in particular, we find that the solution has anisotropic
regularity. More precisely, the solution fails to belong to $H^1$ in the neighbourhood of $\Lambda$,
but exhibits piecewise $H^2$-regularity parallel to $\Lambda$. The splitting theorem can further
be used to formulate a numerical method in which the solution is approximated via its correction
function $w$. This approach has several benefits. Firstly, it recasts the problem as a 3D elliptic
problem with a 3D right-hand side belonging to $L^2$, a problem for which the discretizations and
solvers are readily available. Secondly, it makes the numerical approximation independent of
the discretization of $\Lambda$; thirdly, it improves the approximation properties of the numerical
method. We consider here the Galerkin finite element method, and show that the singularity subtraction
then recovers optimal convergence rates on uniform meshes, i.e., without needing to refine the
mesh around each line segment. The numerical method presented in this paper is therefore well-suited
for applications involving a large number of line segments. We illustrate this by treating a dataset
(consisting of $\sim 3000$ line segments) describing the vascular system of the brain.
