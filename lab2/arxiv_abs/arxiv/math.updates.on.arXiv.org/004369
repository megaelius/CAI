We consider the wave equation with variable coefficients on an exterior domain in $\R^n$($n\ge
2$). We are interested in finding a special uniform decay rate of local energy different from the
constant coefficient wave equation. More concretely, if the dimensional $n$ is even, whether the
uniform decay rate of local energy for the wave equation with variable coefficients can break through
the limit of polynomial and reach exponential; if the dimensional $n$ is odd, whether the uniform
decay rate of local energy for the wave equation with variable coefficients can hold exponential
as the constant coefficient wave equation . \quad \ \ We propose a cone and establish Morawetz's multipliers
in a version of the Riemannian geometry to derive uniform decay of local energy for the wave equation
with variable coefficients. We find that the cone with polynomial growth is closely related to the
uniform decay rate of the local energy. More concretely, for radial solutions, when the cone has
polynomial of degree $\frac{n}{2k-1}$ growth, the uniform decay rate of local energy is exponential;
when the cone has polynomial of degree $\frac{n}{2k}$ growth, the uniform decay rate of local energy
is polynomial at most. In addition, for general solutions, when the cone has polynomial of degree
$n$ growth, we prove that the uniform decay rate of local energy is exponential under suitable Riemannian
metric. It is worth pointing out that such results are independent of the parity of the dimension
$n$, which is the main difference with the constant coefficient wave equation. Finally, for general
solutions, when the cone has polynomial of degree $m$ growth, where $m$ is any positive constant,
we prove that the uniform decay rate of the local energy is of primary polynomial under suitable Riemannian
metric.
