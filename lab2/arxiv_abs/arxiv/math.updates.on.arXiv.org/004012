In this paper, we consider the standard linear solid model in $\mathbb{R}^N$ coupled, first, with
the Fourier law of heat conduction and, second, with the Cattaneo law. First, we give the appropriate
functional setting to prove the well-posedness of both models under certain assumptions on the
parameters (that is, $0<\tau\leq \beta$). Second, using the energy method in the Fourier space,
we obtain the optimal decay rate of a norm related to the solution both in the Fourier and the Cattaneo
heat conduction models under the same assumptions on the parameters. More concretely, we prove
that, when $0<\tau<\beta$, the model with heat conduction has the same decay rate as the Cauchy problem
without heat conduction (see [Pellicer_Said-Houari_AMO_2017]) both under the Fourier and Cattaneo
heat laws. Also, we are able to see that the difference between using a Fourier or Cattaneo law in the
heat conduction is not in the decay rate, but in the fact that the Cattaneo coupling exhibits the well-know
regularity loss phenomenon, that is, Cattaneo model requires a higher regularity of the initial
data for the solution to decay. When $0<\tau=\beta$ (that is, when the dissipation comes through
the heat conduction) we still have asymptotic stability in both heat coupling models, but with a
slower decay rate. As we prove later, such stability is not possible in the absence of the heat conduction.
We also prove the optimality of the previous decay rates for both models by using the eigenvalues
expansion method. Finally, we complete the results in [Pellicer_Said-Houari_AMO_2017] by showing
how the condition $0<\tau< \beta$ is not only sufficient but also necessary for the asymptotic stability
of the problem without heat conduction.
