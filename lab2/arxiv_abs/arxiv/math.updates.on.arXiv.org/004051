The question of a possible excitation and emergence of fractional type dynamics, as a more realistic
framework for understanding emergence of complex systems, directly from a conventional integral
order dynamics, in the form a continuous transition or deformation, is of significant interest.
Although there have been a lot of activities in nonlinear, fractional or not, dynamical systems,
the above question appears yet to be addressed systematically in the current literature. The present
work may be considered to be a step forward in this direction. Based on a novel concept of asymptotic
duality structure, we present here an extended analytical framework that would provide a scenario
for realizing the above stated continuous deformation of integral order dynamics to a local fractional
order dynamics on a fractal and fractional space. The related concepts of self dual and strictly
dual asymptotics are introduced and there relevance in connection with smooth and nonsmooth deformation
of the real line are pointed out. The relationship of the duality structure and renormalization
group is examined. The ordinary derivation operator is shown to be invariant under this duality
enabled renormalization group transformation, leading thereby to a {\em natural} realization
of local fractional type derivative in a fractal space. As an application we discuss linear wave
equation in one and two dimensions and show how the underlying integral order wave equation could
be deformed and renormalized suitably to yield meaningful results for vibration of a fractal string
or wave propagation in a region with fractal boundary.
