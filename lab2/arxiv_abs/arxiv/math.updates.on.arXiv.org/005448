Given a compact connected Lie group G endowed with root datum, and an element w in the corresponding
Artin braid group for G, we describe a filtered G-equivariant stable homotopy type, up to a notion
of quasi-equivalence. We call this homotopy type Strict Broken Symmetries, sB(w) constructed
from the stack of pincipal G-connections on a circle, whose holonomy is broken between consecutive
sectors. We show that sB(w) is independent of the choice of presentation of w, and also satisfies
Markov type properties. Specializing to the case of the unitary group G=U(r), these properties
imply that sB(w) is an invariant of the link L obtained by closing the r-stranded braid w. As such,
we denote it by sB(L). The construction of strict broken symmetries also allows us to incorporate
twistings. This leads to (group valued) link invariants on applying suitable U(r)-equivariant
(twisted) cohomology theories E to sB(L). More precisely, one has spectral sequences induced by
the filtration, converging to the cohomology of the limiting value of the filtration. In followup
articles, we offer two examples of such theories. In the first example, we study a universal twist
of Borel-equivariant singular cohomology. The E_2-term in this case appears to recover sl(n) link
homologies for any value of n (depending on the choice of specialization of the universal twist).
We also show that Triply-graded link homology corresponds to the trivial twist. In the next example,
we apply a version of an equivariant K-theory known as Dominant K-theory, which can be interpreted
as twisted U(r)-equivariant K-theory built from level n representations of the loop group of U(r).
In this case, the E_2-term recovers a deformation of sl(n)-link homology, and has the property that
its value on the unknot is the Grothendieck group of level n-representations of the loop group of
U(1).
