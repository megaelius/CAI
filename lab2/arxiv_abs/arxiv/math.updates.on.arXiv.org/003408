The paper arXiv:1804.11290 contains well-posedness and regularity results for a system of evolutionary
operator equations having the structure of a Cahn-Hilliard system. The operators appearing in
the system equations were fractional versions in the spectral sense of general linear operators
A and B having compact resolvents and are densely defined, unbounded, selfadjoint, and monotone
in a Hilbert space of functions defined in a smooth domain. The associated double-well potentials
driving the phase separation process modeled by the Cahn-Hilliard system could be of a very general
type that includes standard physically meaningful cases such as polynomial, logarithmic, and
double obstacle nonlinearities. In the subsequent paper arXiv:1807.03218, an analysis of distributed
optimal control problems was performed for such evolutionary systems, where only the differentiable
case of certain polynomial and logarithmic double-well potentials could be admitted. Results
concerning existence of optimizers and first-order necessary optimality conditions were derived.
In the present paper, we complement these results by studying a distributed control problem for
such evolutionary systems in the case of nondifferentiable nonlinearities of double obstacle
type. For such nonlinearities, it is well known that the standard constraint qualifications cannot
be applied to construct appropriate Lagrange multipliers. To overcome this difficulty, we follow
here the so-called "deep quench" method. We first give a general convergence analysis of the deep
quench approximation that includes an error estimate and then demonstrate that its use leads in
the double obstacle case to appropriate first-order necessary optimality conditions in terms
of a variational inequality and the associated adjoint state system.
