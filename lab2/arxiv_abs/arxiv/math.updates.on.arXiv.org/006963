This article is the first part of a series of three articles, in which we develop a higher covering
theory of racks and quandles. This project is rooted in M. Eisermann's work on quandle coverings,
and the categorical perspective brought by V. Even, who characterizes coverings as those surjections
which are central, relatively to trivial quandles. We extend this work by application of the techniques
from higher categorical Galois theory (G. Janelidze), and in particular identify meaningful higher-dimensional
centrality conditions defining our higher coverings of racks and quandles. In this first article
(Part I), we revisit and clarify the foundations of the covering theory of interest, we extend it
to the more general context of racks and mathematically describe how to navigate between racks and
quandles. We explain the algebraic ingredients at play, and reinforce the homotopical and topological
interpretations of these ingredients. In particular we justify and insist on the crucial role of
the left adjoint of the conjugation functor Conj between groups and racks (or quandles). We rename
this functor Pth, and explain in which sense it sends a rack to its group of homotopy classes of paths.
We characterize coverings and relative centrality using Pth, but also develop a more visual ''geometrical''
understanding of these conditions. We use alternative generalizable and visual proofs for the
characterization of central extensions. We complete the recovery of M. Eisermann's ad hoc constructions
(weakly universal cover, and fundamental groupoid) from a Galois-theoretic perspective. We sketch
how to deduce M. Eisermann's detailed classification results from the fundamental theorem of categorical
Galois theory. As we develop this refined understanding of the subject, we lay down all the ideas
and results which will articulate the higher-dimensional theory developed in Part II and III.
