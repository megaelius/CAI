The notion of sheaves of (twisted) global Cherednik algebras $H_{t, c, \psi, X, G}$ attached to a
global quotient orbifold $X/G$ was introduced and first studied by Pavel Etingof in $2004$. For
the special case of an affine variety $X$ with a finite group $G$ acting on it, he proved that when $t=1$
and $c, \psi$ are formal parameters, $H_{1, c, \psi, X, G}$ is a universal formal deformation of the
smash product $D_X\rtimes G$ on $X/G$ of the sheaf of differential operators $D_X$ on $X$ and the
group $G$. The main result of this note is a generalization of Etingof's proof to the case of a global
quotient orbifold $X/G$, where $X$ is a generic smooth analytic or algebraic variety. We prove that
in these cases $H_{1, c, \psi, X, G}$ with formal parameters $c$ and $\psi$ is a universal filtered
formal deformation of $D_X\rtimes G$. First, we construct quasi-isomorphisms between the Hochschild
(co)chain complex of $D_X\rtimes G$ and the $G$-invariant part of the direct sum of sheaves of holomorphic
de Rham differential forms on cotangent bundles of the fixed point submanifolds in $X$ associated
to cyclic subgroups of $G$. By means of them we compute the hypercohomology of the Hochschild (co)chain
complex of $D_X\rtimes G$. Combining these quasi-isomorphisms with results from the theory of
filtered algebraic extensions of sheaves of filtered associative algebras we compute the space
$Def(D_X\rtimes G)_f$ of isomorphism classes of filtered infinitesimal deformations of $D_X\rtimes
G$. Finally, we compute the dimension of $Def(D_X\rtimes G)_f$ and consequently prove that the
sheaf of twisted global Cherednik algebras on $X/G$ is a universal filtered deformation of $D_X\rtimes
G$ in the global case.
