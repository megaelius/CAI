Bike-sharing systems are exploding in cities around the world as more people are adopting sustainable
transportation solutions for their everyday commutes. However, as more people use the system,
riders often encounter that bikes or docks might not be available when they arrive to a station. As
a result, many systems like CitiBike and Divvy provide riders with information about the network
via smartphone apps so that riders can find stations with available bikes. However, not all customers
have adopted the use of these smartphone apps for their station selection. By combining customer
choice modeling and finite capacity queueing models, we explore the impact of the smartphone app
technology to increase throughput and reduce blocking in bike sharing systems. To this end, we prove
a mean-field limit and a central limit theorem for an empirical process of the number of stations
with $k$ bikes. We also prove limit theorems for a new process called the ratio process, which characterizes
the proportion of stations whose bike availability ratio lies within a particular partition of
the interval [0,1]. For the mean field limit, we prove that the equilibrium exists, is unique, and
that the stationary distribution of the empirical measure converges to a Dirac mass at the same equilibrium,
thus showing an interchange of limits result ($\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}\lim_{N\rightarrow
\infty}=\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}$). Our limit theorems provide
insight on the mean, variance, and sample path dynamics of large scale bike-sharing systems. Our
results illustrate that if we increase the proportion of customers that use smartphone app information,
the entropy of the bike sharing network is reduced, and riders experience less blocking in the network.
