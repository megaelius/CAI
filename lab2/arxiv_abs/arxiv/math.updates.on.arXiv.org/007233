Mathematical objects are generally abstract and not very approachable. Illustrations and interactive
visualizations help both students and professionals to comprehend mathematical material and
to work with it. This approach lends itself particularly well to geometrical objects. An example
for this category of mathematical objects are hyperbolic geometric spaces. When Euclid lay down
the foundations of mathematics, his formulation of geometry reflected the surrounding space,
as humans perceive it. For about two millennia, it remained unclear whether there are alternative
geometric spaces that carry their own, unique mathematical properties and that do not reflect human
every-day perceptions. Finally, in the early 19th century, several mathematicians described
such geometries, which do not follow Euclid's rules and which were at first interesting solely from
a pure mathematical point of view. These descriptions were not very accessible as mathematicians
approached the geometries via complicated collections of formulae. Within the following decades,
visualization aided the new concepts and two-dimensional versions of these illustrations even
appeared in artistic works. Furthermore, certain aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity provided
applications for non-Euclidean geometric spaces. With the rise of computer graphics towards the
end of the twentieth century, three-dimensional illustrations became available to explore these
geometries and their non-intuitive properties. However, just as the canvas confines the two-dimensional
depictions, the computer monitor confines these three-dimensional visualizations. Only virtual
reality recently made it possible to present immersive experiences of non-Euclidean geometries.
In virtual reality, users have completely new opportunities to encounter geometric properties
and effects that are not present in their surrounding Euclidean world.
