We aim to find a solution $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{C}^n$ to a system of quadratic equations
of the form $b_i=\lvert\langle\bm{a}_i,\bm{x}\rangle\rvert^2$, $i=1,2,\ldots,m$, e.g.,
the well-known phase retrieval problem, which is generally NP-hard. It has been proved that the
number $m = 2n-1$ of generic random measurement vectors $\bm{a}_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is sufficient
and necessary for uniquely determining the $n$-length real vector $\bm{x}$ up to a global sign.
The uniqueness theory, however, does not provide a construction or characterization of this unique
solution. As opposed to the recent nonconvex state-of-the-art solvers, we revert to the convex
relaxation semidefinite programming (SDP) approach and propose to indirectly minimize the convex
objective by successive and incremental nonconvex optimization, termed as \texttt{IncrePR},
to overcome the excessive computation cost of typical SDP solvers. \texttt{IncrePR} avoids sensitive
dependence of initialization of nonconvex approaches and achieves global convergence, which
makes it also promising for more general models and measurements. For real Gaussian model, \texttt{IncrePR}
achieves perfect recovery from $m=2n-1$ noiseless measurement and the recovery is stable from
noisy measurement. When applying \texttt{IncrePR} for structured (non-Gaussian) measurements,
such as transmission matrix and oversampling Fourier measurement, it can also locate a reconstruction
close to true reconstruction with few measurements. Extensive numerical tests show that \texttt{IncrePR}
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the sharpest phase transition of perfect recovery
for Gaussian model and the best reconstruction quality for other non-Gaussian models, in particular
Fourier phase retrieval.
