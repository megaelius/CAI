In this paper, we investigate a class of nonzero-sum dynamic stochastic games consisting of an arbitrary
number of exchangeable players. The players have linear dynamics with quadratic cost functions
and are coupled in both dynamics and cost through the empirical mean and covariance matrix of the
states and actions. We study cooperative and non-cooperative games under three information structures:
perfect sharing, aggregate sharing, and no sharing. For perfect and aggregate sharing information
structures, we use a gauge transformation to solve for the best-response equations of players and
identify a necessary and sufficient condition under which a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
exists. The equilibrium is proved to be fair and linear in the local state and aggregate state. The
corresponding gains are obtained by solving a novel non-standard Riccati equation, whose dimension
is independent of the number of players, thus making the solution scalable. Two approximate sequential
Nash solutions are also proposed for the case of no-sharing information structure. To the best of
our knowledge, this paper is the first to propose a unified framework to obtain the exact sequential
Nash solution in closed form including both cooperative and non-cooperative linear quadratic
games with an arbitrary number of exchangeable players. In addition, the main results are extended
to the discounted and time-averaged infinite-horizon cost functions. Furthermore, the obtained
results can naturally be generalized to the case with multiple exchangeable sub-populations.
Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the obtained results.
