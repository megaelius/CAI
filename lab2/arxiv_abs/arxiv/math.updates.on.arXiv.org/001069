The Computational Algebraic Geometry applied in Algebraic Statistics; are beginning to exploring
new branches and applications; in artificial intelligence and others areas. Currently, the development
of the mathematics is very extensive and it is difficult to see the immediate application of few theorems
in different areas, such as is the case of the Theorem 3.9 given in [10] and proved in part of here. Also
this work has the intention to show the Hilbert basis as a powerful tool in data science; and for that
reason we compile important results proved in works by, S. Watanabe [27], D. Cox, J. Little and H.
Schenck [8], B. Sturmfels [16] and G. Ewald [10]. In this work we study, first, the fundamental concepts
in Toric Algebraic Geometry. The principal contribution of this work is the application of Hilbert
basis (as one realization of Theorem 3.9) for the resolution of singularities with toric varieties,
and a background in Lattice Polytope. In the second part we apply this theorem to problems in statistical
learning, principally in a recent area as is the Singular Learning Theory. We define the singular
machines and the problem of Singular Learning through the computing of learning curves on these
statistical machines. We review and compile results on the work of S. Watanabe in Singular Learning
Theory, ref.; [17], [20], [21], also revising the important result in [26], about almost the machines
are singular, we formalize this theory withtoric resolution morphism in a theorem proved here (Theorem
5.4), characterizing these Learning Machines as toric varieties, and we reproduce results previously
published in Singular Statistical Learning seen in [19], [20], [23].
