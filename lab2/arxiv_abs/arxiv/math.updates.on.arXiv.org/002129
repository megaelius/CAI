We consider a general multi-user Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) system where each mobile user has
multiple independent tasks. These mobile users share the computation and communication resources
while offloading tasks to the cloud. We study both the conventional MCC where tasks are offloaded
to the cloud through a wireless access point, and MCC with a computing access point (CAP), where the
CAP serves both as the network access gateway and a computation service provider to the mobile users.
We aim to jointly optimize the offloading decisions of all users as well as the allocation of computation
and communication resources, to minimize the overall cost of energy, computation, and delay for
all users. The optimization problem is formulated as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic
program, which is NP-hard in general. For the case without a CAP, an efficient approximate solution
named MUMTO is proposed by using separable semidefinite relaxation (SDR), followed by recovery
of the binary offloading decision and optimal allocation of the communication resource. To solve
the more complicated problem with a CAP, we further propose an efficient three-step algorithm named
MUMTO-C comprising of generalized MUMTO SDR with CAP, alternating optimization, and sequential
tuning, which always computes a locally optimal solution. For performance benchmarking, we further
present numerical lower bounds of the minimum system cost with and without the CAP. By comparison
with this lower bound, our simulation results show that the proposed solutions for both scenarios
give nearly optimal performance under various parameter settings, and the resultant efficient
utilization of a CAP can bring substantial cost benefit.
