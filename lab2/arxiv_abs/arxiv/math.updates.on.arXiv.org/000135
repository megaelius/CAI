Stochastic modeling and simulation provide powerful predictive methods for the intrinsic understanding
of fundamental mechanisms in complex biochemical networks. Typically such mathematical models
involve networks of coupled jump stochastic processes with a large number of parameters that need
to be suitably calibrated against experimental data. In this direction, the sensitivity analysis
of the reaction network's parameters is a crucial mathematical and computational tool since it
allows to infer information about the robustness and the identifiability of the model's parameters.
We develop a sensitivity analysis methodology suitable for complex stochastic reaction networks
with a high number of parameters. The proposed approach is based on Information Theory and relies
on the quantification of information loss due to parameter perturbations between time-series
distributions, hence referred to as "pathwise". This is achieved by employing the rigorously-derived
Relative Entropy Rate (RER), which is directly computable from the propensity functions. A key
aspect of the method is that an associated pathwise Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is defined,
which in turn constitutes a gradient-free approach to quantify the parameter sensitivities. The
study of the structure of the FIM which turns out to be block-diagonal reveals hidden parameter dependencies
and sensitivities in reaction networks. The proposed method is tested and validated on two biochemical
systems, namely: (a) the p53 reaction network where quasi-steady stochastic oscillations of the
concentrations are observed and (b) an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) model which is an
example of a high-dimensional stochastic reaction network with more than 200 reactions and a corresponding
number of parameters.
