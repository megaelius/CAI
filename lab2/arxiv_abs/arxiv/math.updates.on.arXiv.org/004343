We analyze the superconvergence properties of ultra-weak discontinuous Galerkin (UWDG) methods
with various choices of flux parameters for one-dimensional linear Schr\"odinger equation. In
our previous work [10], stability and optimal convergence rate are established for a large class
of flux parameters. Depending on the flux choices and if the polynomial degree $k$ is even or odd,
in this paper, we prove $2k$ or $(2k-1)$-th order superconvergence rate for cell averages and numerical
flux of the function, as well as $(2k-1)$ or $(2k-2)$-th order for numerical flux of the derivative.
In addition, we prove superconvergence of $(k+2)$ or $(k+3)$-th order of the DG solution towards
a special projection. At a class of special points, the function values and the first and second order
derivatives of the DG solution are superconvergent with order $k+2, k+1, k$, respectively. The
proof relies on the correction function techniques initiated in [8], and applied to [6] for direct
DG (DDG) methods for diffusion problems. Compared with [6], Schr\"odinger equation poses unique
challenges for superconvergence proof because of the lack of the dissipation mechanism from the
equation. One major highlight of our proof is that we introduce specially chosen test functions
in the error equation and show the superconvergence of the second derivative and jump across the
cell interfaces of the difference between numerical solution and projected exact solution. This
technique was originally proposed in [12] and is essential to elevate the convergence order for
our analysis. Finally, by negative norm estimates, we apply the post-processing technique and
show that the accuracy of our scheme can be enhanced to order $2k.$ Theoretical results are verified
by numerical experiments.
