Reaction networks are systems in which the populations of a finite number of species evolve through
predefined interactions. Such networks are found as modeling tools in many disciplines, spanning
biochemistry, epidemiology, pharmacology, ecology and social networks. It is now well-established
that, for small population sizes, stochastic models for reaction networks are necessary to capture
randomness in the interactions. The tools for analyzing them, however, still lag far behind their
deterministic counterparts. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a constructive framework
for examining the long-term behavior and stability properties of the reaction dynamics in a stochastic
setting. In particular, we address the problems of determining ergodicity of the reaction dynamics,
which is analogous to having a globally attracting fixed point for deterministic dynamics, and
determining moment bounds for the underlying stochastic process. Theoretical and computational
solutions for these problems are obtained by utilizing a blend of ideas and techniques from probability
theory, linear algebra, polynomial analysis and optimization theory. We demonstrate that stability
properties of a wide class of networks can be assessed from theoretical results that can be recast
as efficient and scalable linear programs, well-known for their tractability. It is notably shown
that the computational complexity is often linear in the number of species, but worst-case quadratic.
We illustrate the validity, the efficiency and the universality of our results on several reaction
networks arising in fields such as biochemistry, epidemiology and ecology.
