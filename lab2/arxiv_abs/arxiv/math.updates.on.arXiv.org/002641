This paper addresses some of the experiences encountered and some of the strategies utilized while
using flipped classroom pedagogy in an undergraduate Single Variable Calculus (SVC) course in
a Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC) environment. Due to issues related to instructor-student communication
and students' learning styles, a theoretical framework is built upon three components for learning
environments: inverted Bloom's taxonomy for educational learning objectives, English-medium
instruction (EMI) and integrating technology in the classroom. In this study, four different types
of instruction were designed; three classes were flipped while the fourth acts as a control. Type
A means entirely flipped with instructor-created videos and integrating CAS {\sl Maxima}. Type
B means entirely flipped with third-party videos. Type C is similar to Type A, but instead of the entire
course being flipped, a single topic is flipped. Type D uses the traditional lecture style. By considering
exam scores and students' feedback, both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the flipped pedagogy
were investigated. Quantitative analysis indicates a statistically significant difference
in the exam scores between instruction Type A and Type C as determined by one-way ANOVA ($F(3,306)
= 2.67$, $p = 0.0477$) with small practical significance of the effect size ($\eta^2 = 0.0255$).
Qualitative findings suggest that although students' engagement and communication with instructors
have been enhanced, some challenges related to language and culture, along with minimizing competition
and learning about a new technological tool remain to persist.
