Every finite simple group can be generated by two elements, and in 2000, Guralnick and Kantor resolved
a 1962 question of Steinberg by proving that in a finite simple group every nontrivial element belongs
to a generating pair. Groups with this property are said to be $\frac{3}{2}$-generated. Which finite
groups are $\frac{3}{2}$-generated? Every proper quotient of a $\frac{3}{2}$-generated group
is cyclic, and in 2008, Breuer, Guralnick and Kantor made the striking conjecture that this condition
alone provides a complete characterisation of the finite groups with this property. This conjecture
has recently been reduced to the almost simple groups and results of Piccard (1939) and Woldar (1994)
show that the conjecture is true for almost simple groups whose socles are alternating or sporadic
groups. Therefore, the central focus is now on the almost simple groups of Lie type. In this monograph
we prove a strong version of this conjecture for almost simple classical groups, building on earlier
work of Burness and Guest (2013) and the author (2017). More precisely, we show that every relevant
almost simple classical group has uniform spread at least two, unless it is isomorphic to the symmetric
group of degree six. We also prove that the uniform spread of these groups tends to infinity if the
size of the underlying field tends to infinity. To prove these results, we are guided by a probabilistic
approach introduced by Guralnick and Kantor. This requires a detailed analysis of automorphisms,
fixed point ratios and subgroup structure of almost simple classical groups, so the first half of
this monograph is dedicated to these general topics. In particular, we give a general exposition
of the useful technique of Shintani descent, which plays an important role throughout.
