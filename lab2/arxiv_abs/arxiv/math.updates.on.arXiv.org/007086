In this paper, we investigate a class of nonzero-sum dynamic stochastic games, where players have
linear dynamics and quadratic cost functions. The players are coupled in both dynamics and cost
through a linear regression (weighted average) as well as a quadratic regression (weighted covariance
matrix) of the states and actions, where the linear regression of states is called deep state. We
study collaborative and non-collaborative games under three information structures: perfect
sharing, deep state sharing, and no sharing for three different types of weights: positive, homogeneous
and asymptotically vanishing weights. For perfect and deep state sharing information structures,
we propose a transformation-based technique to solve for the best-response equations of players
and identify a few sufficient conditions under which a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
exists. The equilibrium is linear in the local state and deep state, and the corresponding gains
are obtained by solving a novel non-standard Riccati equation (whose dimension is independent
of the number of players, thus making the solution scalable). When the information structure is
no-sharing and the number of players is asymptotically large, one approximate population-size-dependent
equilibrium and one approximate population-size-independent equilibrium (also called sequential
weighted mean-field equilibrium) are proposed, and their convergence to the infinite-population
limits are established. In addition, the main results are extended to infinite-horizon cost function,
and generalized to multiple orthogonal linear regressions and heterogeneous sub-populations.
A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the difference between the two proposed approximate
equilibria.
