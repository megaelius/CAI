Motivated by the wild behavior of isolated essential singularities in complex analysis, we study
singular complex analytic vector fields $X$ on arbitrary Riemann surfaces $M$. By vector field
singularities we understand zeros, poles, isolated essential singularities and accumulation
points of the above kind. In this framework, a singular analytic vector field $X$ has canonically
associated; a 1-form, a quadratic differential, a flat metric (with a geodesic foliation), a global
distinguished parameter or $\mathbb{C}$-flow box $\Psi_X$, a Newton map $\Phi_X$, and a Riemann
surface $\mathcal{R}_X$ arising from the maximal $\mathbb{C}$-flow of $X$. We show that every
singular complex analytic vector field $X$ on a Riemann surface is in fact both a global pullback
of the constant vector field under $\Psi_X$ and of the radial vector field on the sphere under $\Phi_X$.
As a result of independent interest, we show that the maximal analytic continuation of the a local
$\mathbb{C}$-flow of $X$ is univalued on the Riemann surface $\mathcal{R}_{X} \subset M \times
\mathbb{C}_t$, where $\mathcal{R}_X$ is the graph of $\Psi_{X}$. Furthermore we explore the geometry
of singular complex analytic vector fields and present a geometrical method that enables us to obtain
the solution, without numerical integration, to the differential equation that provides the $\mathbb{C}$-flow
of the vector field. We discuss the theory behind the method, its implementation, comparison with
some integration-based techniques, as well as examples of the visualization of complex vector
fields on the plane, sphere and torus. Applications to visualization of complex valued functions
is discussed including some advantages between other methods.
