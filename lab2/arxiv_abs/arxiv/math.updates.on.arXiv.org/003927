We study nearby monodromy eigenvalues -- the eigenvalues of the monodromy operators of singularities,
adjacent to a given singularity of a holomorphic function $f:(C^n,0)\to(C,0)$. More precisely,
we express some of such values in terms of a toric resolution of the image of $f=0$ under a suitable
embedding $C^n\hookrightarrow C^N$. The expression is given it terms of the exceptional divisor
strata of arbitrary codimension, in contrast to the classical A'Campo formula that consumes only
codimension 1 strata and produces only monodromy eigenvalues at the origin. For this purpose, we
introduce tropical characteristic classes of germs of analytic sets, and use this calculus to detect
some of the nearby monodromy eigenvalues, which we call tropical. The study is motivated by the monodromy
conjectures by Igusa, Denef and Loeser: every pole of an appropriate local zeta function of $f$ induces
a nearby monodromy eigenvalue. We propose a stronger version of this conjecture: all poles of the
local zeta function induce tropical nearby monodromy eigenvalues. In particular, if the singularity
is non-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron $N$, then the tropical monodromy eigenvalues
can be expressed in terms of fiber polytopes of certain faces of $N$, so our conjecture (unlike the
original ones) becomes a purely combinatorial statement about a polyhedron. This statement is
confirmed for the topological zeta function and $n\leqslant 4$ in a joint work with A. Lemahieu and
K. Takeuchi, which, in particular, supports our conjecture and proves the original one by Denef
and Loeser for non-degenerate singularities in 4 variables.
