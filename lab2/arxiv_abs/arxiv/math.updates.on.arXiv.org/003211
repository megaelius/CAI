A general family of peakon equations is introduced, involving two arbitrary functions of the wave
amplitude and the wave gradient. This family contains all of the known breaking wave equations,
including the integrable ones: Camassa-Holm equation, Degasperis-Procesi equation, Novikov
equation, and FORQ/modified Camassa-Holm equation. One main result is to show that all of the equations
in the general family possess weak solutions given by multi-peakons which are a linear superposition
of peakons with time-dependent amplitudes and positions. In particular, neither an integrability
structure nor a Hamiltonian structure is needed to derive $N$-peakon weak solutions for arbitrary
$N>1$. As a further result, single peakon travelling-wave solutions are shown to exist under a simple
condition on one of the two arbitrary functions in the general family of equations, and when this
condition fails, generalized single peakon solutions that have a time-dependent amplitude and
a time-dependent speed are shown to exist. Wave breaking criteria are outlined for this general
family of peakon equations. An interesting generalization of the Camassa-Holm and FORQ/modified
Camassa-Holm equations is obtained by deriving the most general subfamily of peakon equations
that possess the Hamiltonian structure shared by the Camassa-Holm and FORQ/modified Camassa-Holm
equations. Peakon travelling-wave solutions and their features, including a variational formulation
(minimizer problem), are derived for these generalized equations. A final main result is that $2$-peakon
weak solutions are investigated and shown to exhibit several novel kinds of behaviour, including
the formation of a bound pair consisting of a peakon and an anti-peakon that have a maximum finite
separation.
