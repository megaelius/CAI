We study the problem of efficiently refuting the k-colorability of a graph, or equivalently certifying
a lower bound on its chromatic number. We give formal evidence of average-case computational hardness
for this problem in sparse random regular graphs, showing optimality of a simple spectral certificate.
This evidence takes the form of a computationally-quiet planting: we construct a distribution
of d-regular graphs that has significantly smaller chromatic number than a typical regular graph
drawn uniformly at random, while providing evidence that these two distributions are indistinguishable
by a large class of algorithms. We generalize our results to the more general problem of certifying
an upper bound on the maximum k-cut. This quiet planting is achieved by minimizing the effect of the
planted structure (e.g. colorings or cuts) on the graph spectrum. Specifically, the planted structure
corresponds exactly to eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. This avoids the pushout effect of
random matrix theory, and delays the point at which the planting becomes visible in the spectrum
or local statistics. To illustrate this further, we give similar results for a Gaussian analogue
of this problem: a quiet version of the spiked model, where we plant an eigenspace rather than adding
a generic low-rank perturbation. Our evidence for computational hardness of distinguishing two
distributions is based on three different heuristics: stability of belief propagation, the local
statistics hierarchy, and the low-degree likelihood ratio. Of independent interest, our results
include general-purpose bounds on the low-degree likelihood ratio for multi-spiked matrix models,
and an improved low-degree analysis of the stochastic block model.
