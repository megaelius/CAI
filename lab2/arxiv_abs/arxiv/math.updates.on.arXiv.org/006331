We study the Bonnet problem for surfaces in 4-dimensional space forms, where two isometric surfaces
have the same mean curvature if there exists a parallel vector bundle isometry between their normal
bundles that preserves the mean curvature vector fields. We deal with the moduli space of congruence
classes of isometric surfaces with the same mean curvature, and with properties inherited on a surface
by its structure. The study of this problem led us to a new conformally invariant property, called
isotropic isothermicity, that coincides with the usual concept of isothermicity for surfaces
lying in totally umbilical hypersurfaces, and is related to lines of curvature and infinitesimal
isometric deformations that preserve the mean curvature vector field. We show that if a simply-connected
surface is not proper Bonnet, then it admits either at most one, or exactly three Bonnet mates. For
simply-connected proper Bonnet surfaces, the moduli space is either 1-dimensional with at most
two connected components diffeomorphic to the circle, or the 2-dimensional torus. We prove that
simply-connected Bonnet surfaces lying in totally geodesic hypersurfaces as surfaces of nonconstant
mean curvature, admit Bonnet mates that do not lie in any totally umbilical hypersurface. We show
that isotropic isothermicity characterizes the proper Bonnet surfaces, and we provide relevant
conditions for non-existence of Bonnet mates for compact surfaces. Moreover, we study compact
surfaces that are locally proper Bonnet, and we prove that the existence of a uniform substructure
on the local moduli spaces, characterizes surfaces with a vertically harmonic Gauss lift that are
neither minimal, nor superconformal. In particular, we show that the only compact, locally proper
Bonnet surfaces with moduli space the torus, are those with nonvanishing parallel mean curvature
vector field and positive genus.
