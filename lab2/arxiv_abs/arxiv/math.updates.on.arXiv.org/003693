In this paper we develop a new approach for studying overlapping iterated function systems. This
approach is inspired by a famous result due to Khintchine from Diophantine approximation. This
result shows that for a family of limsup sets, their Lebesgue measure is determined by the convergence
or divergence of naturally occurring volume sums. For many parameterised families of overlapping
iterated function systems, we prove that a typical member will exhibit similar Khintchine like
behaviour. Families of iterated function systems our results apply to include those arising from
Bernoulli convolutions, the $\{0,1,3\}$ problem, and affine contractions with varying translation
parameter. As a by-product of our analysis we obtain new proofs of well known results due to Solomyak
on the absolute continuity of Bernoulli convolutions, and when the attractor in the $\{0,1,3\}$
problem has positive Lebesgue measure. For each $t\in [0,1]$ we let $\Phi_t$ be the iterated function
system given by $$\Phi_{t}:=\Big\{\phi_1(x)=\frac{x}{2},\phi_2(x)=\frac{x+1}{2},\phi_3(x)=\frac{x+t}{2},\phi_{4}(x)=\frac{x+1+t}{2}\Big\}.$$
We include a detailed study of this family. We prove that either $\Phi_t$ contains an exact overlap,
or we observe Khintchine like behaviour. Our analysis of this family shows that by studying the metric
properties of limsup sets, we can distinguish between the overlapping behaviour of iterated function
systems in a way that is not available to us by simply studying properties of self-similar measures.
Last of all, we introduce a property of an iterated function system that we call being consistently
separated with respect to a measure. We prove that this property implies that the pushforward of
the measure is absolutely continuous. We include several explicit examples of consistently separated
iterated function systems.
