We consider the nilpotent left-invariant sub-Riemannian structure on the Engel group. This structure
gives a fundamental local approximation of a generic rank 2 sub-Riemannian structure on a 4-manifold
near a generic point (in particular, of the kinematic models of a car with a trailer). On the other
hand, this is the simplest sub-Riemannian structure of step three. We describe the global structure
of the cut locus (the set of points where geodesics lose their global optimality), the Maxwell set
(the set of points that admit more than one minimizer), and the intersection of the cut locus with
the caustic (the set of conjugate points along all geodesics). The group of symmetries of the cut
locus is described: it is generated by a one-parameter group of dilations $\mathbb{R}_+$ and a discrete
group of reflections $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. The cut locus admits
a stratification with 6 three-dimensional strata, 12 two-dimensional strata, and 2 one-dimensional
strata. Three-dimen-sional strata of the cut locus are Maxwell strata of multiplicity 2 (for each
point there are 2 minimizers). Two-dimensional strata of the cut locus consist of conjugate points.
Finally, one-dimensional strata are Maxwell strata of infinite multiplicity, they consist of
conjugate points as well. Projections of sub-Riemannian geodesics to the 2-dimensional plane
of the distribution are Euler elasticae. For each point of the cut locus, we describe the Euler elasticae
corresponding to minimizers coming to this point. Finally, we describe the structure of the optimal
synthesis, i.e., the set of minimizers for each terminal point in the Engel group.
