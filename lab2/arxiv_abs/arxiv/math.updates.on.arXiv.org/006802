For an $n\times n$ matrix $A_n$, the $r\to p$ operator norm is defined as $$\|A_n\|_{r\to p}:= \sup_{\boldsymbol{x}\in
\mathbb{R}^n:\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_r\leq 1 } \|A_n\boldsymbol{x}\|_p \qquad \text{for}\quad
r,p\geq 1.$$ For different choices of $r$ and $p$, this norm corresponds to key quantities that arise
in diverse applications including matrix condition number estimation, clustering of data, and
finding oblivious routing schemes in transportation networks. This article considers $r\to p$
norms of symmetric random matrices with nonnegative entries, including adjacency matrices of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, matrices with positive sub-Gaussian entries, and certain sparse
matrices. For $1< p\leq r< \infty$, the asymptotic normality, as $n\to\infty$, of the appropriately
centered and scaled norm $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is established. This is also shown to imply, as a corollary,
asymptotic normality of the solution to the $\ell_p$ quadratic maximization problem, also known
as the $\ell_p$ Grothendieck problem for $p\geq 2$. Furthermore, a sharp $\ell_\infty$-approximation
for the unique maximizing vector in the definition of $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is obtained, which may
be of independent interest. In fact, the vector approximation result is shown to hold for a broad
class of deterministic sequence of matrices having certain asymptotic expansion properties.
The results obtained can be viewed as a generalization of the seminal results of F\"{u}redi and Koml\'{o}s
(1981) on asymptotic normality of the largest singular value of a class of symmetric random matrices,
which corresponds to the special case $r=p=2$ considered here. In the general case with $1< p\leq
r < \infty$, the spectral methods are no longer applicable, which requires a new approach, involving
a refined convergence analysis of a nonlinear power method and establishing a perturbation bound
on the maximizing vector.
