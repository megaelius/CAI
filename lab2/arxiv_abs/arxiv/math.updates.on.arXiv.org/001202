Recently variational models with priors involving first and second order derivatives resp. differences
were successfully applied for image restoration. There are several ways to incorporate the derivatives
of first and second order into the prior, for example additive coupling or using infimal convolution
(IC), as well as the more general model of total generalized variation (TGV). The later two methods
give also decompositions of the restored images into image components with distinct "smoothness"
properties which are useful in applications. This paper is the first attempt to generalize these
models to manifold-valued images. We propose both extrinsic and intrinsic approaches. The extrinsic
approach is based on embedding the manifold into an Euclidean space of higher dimension. Models
following this approach can be formulated within the Euclidean space with a constraint restricting
them to the manifold. Then alternating direction methods of multipliers can be employed for finding
minima. However, the components within the infimal convolution or total generalized variation
decomposition live in the embedding space rather than on the manifold which makes their interpretation
difficult. Therefore we also investigate two intrinsic approaches. For manifolds which are Lie
groups we propose three priors which exploit the group operation, an additive one, another with
IC coupling and a third TGV like one. For computing the minimizers of the intrinsic models we apply
gradient descent algorithms. For general Riemannian manifolds we further define a model for infimal
convolution based on the recently developed second order differences. We demonstrate by numerical
examples that our approaches works well for the circle, the 2-sphere, the rotation group, and the
manifold of positive definite matrices with the affine invariant metric.
