In this article it is proved that the dynamical properties of a broad class of semilinear parabolic
problems are sensitive to arbitrarily small but smooth perturbations of the nonlinear term, when
the spatial dimension is either equal to one or two. This topological instability is shown to result
from a local deformation of the global bifurcation diagram associated with the corresponding elliptic
problems. Such a deformation is shown to systematically occur via the creation of either a multiple-point
or a new fold-point on this diagram when an appropriate small perturbation is applied to the nonlinear
term. More precisely, it is shown that for a broad class of nonlinear elliptic problems, one can always
find an arbitrary small perturbation of the nonlinear term, that generates a local S on the bifurcation
diagram whereas the latter is e.g. monotone when no perturbation is applied; substituting thus
a single solution by several ones. Such an increase in the local multiplicity of the solutions to
the elliptic problem results then into a topological instability for the corresponding parabolic
problem. The rigorous proof of the latter instability result requires though to revisit the classical
concept of topological equivalence to encompass important cases for the applications such as semi-linear
parabolic problems for which the semigroup may exhibit non-global dissipative properties, allowing
for the coexistence of blow-up regions and local attractors in the phase space; cases that arise
e.g. in combustion theory. A revised framework of topological robustness is thus introduced in
that respect within which the main topological instability result is then proved for continuous,
locally Lipschitz but not necessarily $C^1$ nonlinear terms, that prevent in particular the use
of linearization techniques, and for which the family of semigroups may exhibit non-dissipative
properties.
