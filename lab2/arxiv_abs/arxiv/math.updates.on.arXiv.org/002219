In this paper, we propose an accurate finite difference method to discretize the two and three dimensional
fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$ in the hypersingular integral form and apply it
to solve the fractional reaction-diffusion equations. The key idea of our method is to split the
strong singular kernel function of the fractional Laplacian. Hence, we first formulate the fractional
Laplacian as the weighted integral of a central difference quotient and then approximate it by the
weighted trapezoidal rule. It is proved that for $u \in C^{3, \alpha/2}(R^d)$, our method has an
accuracy of $O(h^2)$, uniformly for any $\alpha \in (0, 2)$, while for $u \in C^{1, \alpha/2}(R^d)$,
the accuracy is $O(h^{1-\alpha/2})$. As $\alpha \to 2^-$, the convergence behavior of our method
is consistent with that of the central difference approximation of the classical Laplace operator.
This study would fill the gap in the literature on numerical methods for the high dimensional factional
Laplacian. In addition, we apply our method to solve the fractional reaction-diffusion equations
and present a fast algorithm for their efficient computations. The computational cost of our method
is O(M log M), and the storage memory is O(M), with M the total number of spatial unknowns. Moreover,
our method is simple and easy to implement. Various examples, including the two-dimensional fractional
Allen-Cahn equation, and two- and three-dimensional fractional Gray-Scott equations, are provided
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It shows that our method is accurate and efficient
in solving the higher dimensional fractional reaction-diffusion equation, and it can be easily
applied to solve other fractional PDEs.
