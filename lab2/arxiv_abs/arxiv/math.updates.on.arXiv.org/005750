Let $X$ be a compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold, and write $\mathcal M,\bar{\mathcal M}$ for the moduli stacks
of objects in coh$(X),D^b$coh$(X)$. There are natural line bundles $K_{\mathcal M}\to\mathcal
M$, $K_{\bar{\mathcal M}}\to\bar{\mathcal M}$, analogues of canonical bundles. Orientation
data on $\mathcal M,\bar{\mathcal M}$ is an isomorphism class of square root line bundles $K_{\mathcal
M}^{1/2},K_{\bar{\mathcal M}}^{1/2}$, satisfying a compatibility condition on the stack of
short exact sequences. It was introduced by Kontsevich and Soibelman arXiv:1006.270 in their theory
of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and is important in categorifying Donaldson-Thomas
theory using perverse sheaves. We show that natural orientation data can be constructed for all
compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and also for compactly-supported coherent sheaves and perfect complexes
on noncompact Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$ with a spin smooth projective compactification $X\hookrightarrow
Y$. This proves a long-standing conjecture in Donaldson-Thomas theory. These are special cases
of a more general result. Let $X$ be a spin smooth projective 3-fold. Using the spin structure we construct
line bundles $K_{\mathcal M}\to\mathcal M$, $K_{\bar{\mathcal M}}\to\bar{\mathcal M}$. We
define spin structures on $\mathcal M,\bar{\mathcal M}$ to be isomorphism classes of square roots
$K_{\mathcal M}^{1/2},K_{\bar{\mathcal M}}^{1/2}$. We prove that natural spin structures exist
on $\mathcal M,\bar{\mathcal M}$. They are equivalent to orientation data when $X$ is a Calabi-Yau
3-fold with the trivial spin structure. We prove this using our previous paper arXiv:1908.03524,
which constructs 'spin structures' (square roots of a certain complex line bundle $K_P\to\mathcal
B_P$) on differential-geometric moduli stacks $\mathcal B_P$ of connections on a principal U$(m)$-bundle
$P\to X$ over a compact spin 6-manifold $X$.
