This paper addresses testing of compressed structures, such as shells, that exhibit catastrophic
buckling and notorious imperfection sensitivity. The central concept is the probing of a loaded
structural specimen by a controlled lateral displacement to gain quantitative insight into its
buckling behaviour and to measure the energy barrier against buckling. This can provide design
information about a structure's stiffness and robustness against buckling in terms of energy and
force landscapes. Developments in this area are relatively new but have proceeded rapidly with
encouraging progress. Recent experimental tests on uniformly compressed spherical shells, and
axially loaded cylinders, show excellent agreement with theoretical solutions. The probing technique
could be a valuable experimental procedure for testing prototype structures, but before it can
be used a range of potential problems must be examined and solved. The probing response is highly
nonlinear and a variety of complications can occur. Here, we make a careful assessment of unexpected
limit points and bifurcations, that could accompany probing, causing complications and possibly
even collapse of a test specimen. First, a limit point in the probe displacement (associated with
a cusp instability and fold) can result in dynamic buckling as probing progresses, as demonstrated
in the buckling of a spherical shell under volume control. Second, various types of bifurcations
which can occur on the probing path which result in the probing response becoming unstable are also
discussed. To overcome these problems, we outline the extra controls over the entire structure
that may be needed to stabilize the response.
