Stieltjes, Perron, and Markov in analysis of the moment problem, for absolutely continuous measures,
constructed the underlying measure as the discontinuity across the cut of a Cauchy representation
of an otherwise real-analytic function. Introduction of Gaussian quadratures suggests more direct
approaches. The real, positive, and continuous weight function, rho(x), is constructed directly
from interpolation of the zeros, x[k], and weights, w[k], of the polynomials orthogonal for that
measure. This novel numerical approach rests on a simple theorem: namely, rho(x[k]), evaluated
at the quadrature point x[k], is approximated by w[k]/(dx[k]/dk), with k now being assumed to be
a continuous real variable. This derivative rule is shown to be closely related to a simple type of
universal behavior, relating the clock-rule spacings of the x[k] to the derivatives dx[k]/dk which,
once established, allows an immediate derivation of the derivative rule, via known and well understood
clock-rule results for Nevai-Blumenthal class polynomials. This framework also leads to a statement
of a universality for quadrature weights and weight functions. This is implicit in statements of
clock-rule universality for the N-B class, but not made explicit. This new universality is illustrated
for several classical orthogonal polynomials, and the non-classical Pollaczek polynomials.
The derivative rule is then applied to the problem of numerical Stieltjes inversion, for both finite
and unbounded intervals giving exponential convergence. Exponential convergence stands in stark
contrast to the power law convergence of historically well-known histogram techniques A final
section traces the origin of the derivative rule in developing novel approaches to the use of discrete
spectral resolutions of Schr\"odinger operators.
