This paper studies the energy efficiency and sum rate trade-off for coordinated beamforming in
multi-cell multi-user multigroup multicast multiple-input single-output systems. We first
consider a conventional network energy efficiency maximization (EEmax) problem by jointly optimizing
the transmit beamformers and antennas selected to be used in transmission. We also account for per-antenna
maximum power constraints to avoid non-linear distortion in power amplifiers and user-specific
minimum rate constraints to guarantee certain service levels and fairness. To be energy-efficient,
transmit antenna selection is employed. It eventually leads to a mixed-Boolean fractional program.
We then propose two different approaches to solve this difficult problem. The first solution is
based on a novel modeling technique that produces a tight continuous relaxation. The second approach
is based on sparsity-inducing method, which does not require the introduction of any Boolean variable.
We also investigate the trade-off between the energy efficiency and sum rate by proposing two different
formulations. In the first formulation, we propose a new metric that is the ratio of the sum rate and
the so-called weighted power. Specifically, this metric reduces to EEmax when the weight is 1, and
to sum rate maximization when the weight is 0. In the other method, we treat the trade-off problem
as a multi-objective optimization for which a scalarization approach is adopted. Numerical results
illustrate significant achievable energy efficiency gains over the method where the antenna selection
is not employed. The effect of antenna selection on the energy efficiency and sum rate trade-off
is also demonstrated.
