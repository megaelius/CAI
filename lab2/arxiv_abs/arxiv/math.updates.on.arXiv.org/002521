Every invertible, measure-preserving dynamical system induces a Koopman operator, which is a
linear, unitary evolution operator acting on the $L^2$ space of observables associated with the
invariant measure. Koopman eigenfunctions represent the quasiperiodic, or non-mixing, component
of the dynamics. The extraction of these eigenfunctions and their associated eigenfrequencies
from a given time series is a non-trivial problem when the underlying system has a continuous spectrum
or a dense point spectrum, behaving similarly to a noisy component of the signal. This paper describes
methods for identifying Koopman eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions from a discretely sampled
time series generated by such a system with unknown dynamics. Our main result gives necessary and
sufficient conditions for a Fourier function, defined on $N$ states sampled along an orbit of the
dynamics, to be extensible to a Koopman eigenfunction on the whole state space, lying in a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In particular, we show that such an extension exists if and only if the
RKHS norm of the Fourier function does not diverge as $ N \to \infty $, in which case the corresponding
Fourier frequency is also a Koopman eigenfrequency. Using these results, we establish data-driven
criteria for identifying Koopman eigenfrequencies from a set of candidate frequencies. Numerical
experiments on mixed-spectrum systems with weak periodic components demonstrate that this approach
has significantly higher skill in identifying Koopman eigenfrequencies compared to conventional
spectral estimation techniques based on the discrete Fourier transform.
