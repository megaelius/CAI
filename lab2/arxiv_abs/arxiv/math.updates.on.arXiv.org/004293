We deliver a novel approach towards the variational description of Lagrangian mechanical systems
subject to fractional damping by establishing a restricted Hamilton's principle. Fractional
damping is a particular instance of non-local (in time) damping, which is ubiquitous in mechanical
engineering applications. The restricted Hamilton's principle relies on including fractional
derivatives to the state space, the doubling of curves (which implies an extra mirror system) and
the restriction of the class of varied curves. We will obtain the correct dynamics, and will show
rigorously that the extra mirror dynamics is nothing but the main one in reversed time; thus, the
restricted Hamilton's principle is not adding extra physics to the original system. The price to
pay, on the other hand, is that the fractional damped dynamics is only a sufficient condition for
the extremals of the action. In addition, we proceed to discretise the new principle. This discretisation
provides a set of numerical integrators for the continuous dynamics that we denote Fractional Variational
Integrators (FVIs). The discrete dynamics is obtained upon the same ingredients, say doubling
of discrete curves and restriction of the discrete variations. We display the performance of the
FVIs, which have local truncation order 1, in two examples. As other integrators with variational
origin, for instance those generated by the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle, they show
a superior performance tracking the dissipative energy, in opposition to direct (order 1) discretisations
of the dissipative equations, such as explicit and implicit Euler schemes.
