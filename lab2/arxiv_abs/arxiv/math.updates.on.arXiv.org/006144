Various quantum analogues of the central limit theorem, which is one of the cornerstones of probability
theory, are known in the literature. One such analogue, due to Cushen and Hudson, is of particular
relevance for quantum optics. It implies that the state in any single output arm of an $n$-splitter,
which is fed with $n$ copies of a centred state $\rho$ with finite second moments, converges to the
Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as $\rho$. Here we exploit the phase space formalism
to carry out a refined analysis of the rate of convergence in this quantum central limit theorem.
For instance, we prove that the convergence takes place at a rate $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/2}\right)$
in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm whenever the third moments of $\rho$ are finite. Trace norm or relative
entropy bounds can be obtained by leveraging the energy boundedness of the state. Via analytical
and numerical examples we show that our results are tight in many respects. An extension of our proof
techniques to the non-i.i.d. setting is used to analyse a new model of a lossy optical fibre, where
a given $m$-mode state enters a cascade of $n$ beam splitters of equal transmissivities $\lambda^{1/n}$
fed with an arbitrary (but fixed) environment state. Assuming that the latter has finite third moments,
and ignoring unitaries, we show that the effective channel converges in diamond norm to a simple
thermal attenuator, with a rate $\mathcal{O}\Big(n^{-\frac{1}{2(m+1)}}\Big)$. This allows
us to establish bounds on the classical and quantum capacities of the cascade channel. Along the
way, we derive several results that may be of independent interest. For example, we prove that any
quantum characteristic function $\chi_\rho$ is uniformly bounded by some $\eta_\rho<1$ outside
of any neighbourhood of the origin; also, $\eta_\rho$ can be made to depend only on the energy of the
state $\rho$.
