We present a general method for constructing a new class of topological Ramsey spaces. Members of
such spaces are infinite sequences of products of Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} classes of finite relational
structures satisfying the Ramsey property. We extend the Product Ramsey Theorem of Soki\v{c} to
equivalence relations for finite products of structures from Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} classes of finite
relational structures satisfying the Ramsey property. This is then applied to prove Ramsey-classification
theorems for equivalence relations on fronts, generalizing the Pudlak-Rodl Theorem to our class
of topological Ramsey spaces. To each topological Ramsey space in this framework correspond associated
ultrafilters satisfying weak partition properties. The Ramsey-classification theorems are
applied to classify the structure of the Tukey types of all ultrafilters Tukey reducible to the associated
ultrafilter. Furthermore, the structure of the Rudin-Keisler classes inside each Tukey type are
also completely classified in terms of the embedding relation on the Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} classes.
Examples of topological Ramsey spaces constructed from our method include spaces which generate
p-points which are $k$-arrow but not $k+1$-arrow, simplifying constructions of Baumgartner and
Taylor; hypercube spaces $\mathcal{H}^n$, $2\le n<\omega$, generalizing a construction
of Blass. Each $\mathcal{H}^n$; and more generally any space in our framework in which blocks are
products of $n$ many structures, produces ultrafilters with Tukey structures below them which
are exactly the $n$-element Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(n)$. These are the first examples of
initial structures in the Tukey types of ultrafilters which are not simply linear chains.
