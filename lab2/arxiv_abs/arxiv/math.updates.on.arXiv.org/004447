This two-part paper considers the day-ahead operational planning problem of a radial distribution
network hosting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and Electric
Vehicles (EVs). In Part I, we develop a novel AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model that estimates dynamic
Distribution nodal Location Marginal Costs (DLMCs) of real and reactive power including transformer
degradation. These all-inclusive DLMCs are key in the co-optimization of the distribution network
and DER schedules. Part II discusses the implication of using DLMCs to represent the benefit of shifting
real/reactive power across time and achieve optimal Distribution Network and DER operation. Moreover,
it evaluates, elaborates and analyzes the novel AC OPF through extensive numerical results of actual
distribution feeder-based case studies involving a wealth of future EV and PV adoption scenarios.
Optimal schedules are compared to schedules that rely on apparently reasonable approaches, namely
Business as Usual (i.e., do nothing), Time of Use, and traditional line loss minimization. The overwhelming
evidence of extensive numerical results supports the significant benefits of internalizing short-run
marginal asset - primarily transformer - degradation. Apart from optimal short-run scheduling,
the proposed approach can harvest otherwise idle DER (PV/EV) reactive power compensation capabilities,
increase distribution network DER (PV/EV) hosting capacity, and mitigate investments in distribution
infrastructure that would be otherwise required to support distribution utilities' obligation
to serve. Finally, numerical evidence on the benefits of AC OPF modeling intertemporal transformer
life degradation suggests that it may be worth considering the introduction of intra-day markets.
