This paper is concerned with the intrinsic geometric structures of conductive transmission eigenfunctions.
The geometric properties of interior transmission eigenfunctions were first studied in \cite{BL2017b}.
It is shown in two scenarios that the interior transmission eigenfunction must be locally vanishing
near a corner of the domain with an interior angle less than $\pi$. We significantly extend and generalize
those results in several aspects. First, we consider the conductive transmission eigenfunctions
which include the interior transmission eigenfunctions as a special case. The geometric structures
established for the conductive transmission eigenfunctions in this paper include the results
in \cite{BL2017b} as a special case. Second, the vanishing property of the conductive transmission
eigenfunctions is established for any corner as long as its interior angle is not $\pi$. That means,
as long as the corner singularity is not degenerate, the vanishing property holds. Third, the regularity
requirements on the interior transmission eigenfunctions in \cite{BL2017b} are significantly
relaxed in the present study for the conductive transmission eigenfunctions. In order to establish
the geometric properties for the conductive transmission eigenfunctions, we develop technically
new methods and the corresponding analysis is much more complicated than that in \cite{BL2017b}.
Finally, as an interesting and practical application of the obtained geometric results, we establish
a unique recovery result for the inverse problem associated with the transverse electromagnetic
scattering by a single far-field measurement in simultaneously determining a polygonal conductive
obstacle and its surface conductive parameter.
