In this paper, we prove the mean-convex neighborhood conjecture for neck singularities of the mean
curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for all $n\geq 3$: we show that if a mean curvature flow $\{M_t\}$
in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ has an $S^{n-1}\times \mathbb{R}$ singularity at $(x_0,t_0)$, then there
exists an $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(x_0,t_0)>0$ such that $M_t\cap B(x_0,\varepsilon)$ is
mean-convex for all $t\in(t_0-\varepsilon^2,t_0+\varepsilon^2)$. As in the case $n=2$, which
was resolved by the first three authors in arXiv:1810.08467, the existence of such a mean-convex
neighborhood follows from classifying a certain class of ancient Brakke flows that arise as potential
blowup limits near a neck singularity. Specifically, we prove that any ancient unit-regular integral
Brakke flow with a cylindrical blowdown must be either a round shrinking cylinder, a translating
bowl soliton, or an ancient oval. In particular, combined with a prior result of the last two authors,
we obtain uniqueness of mean curvature flow through neck singularities. The main difficulty in
addressing the higher dimensional case is in promoting the spectral analysis on the cylinder to
global geometric properties of the solution. Most crucially, due to the potential wide variety
of self-shrinking flows with entropy lower than the cylinder when $n\geq 3$, smoothness does not
follow from the spectral analysis by soft arguments. This precludes the use of the classical moving
plane method to derive symmetry. To overcome this, we introduce a novel variant of the moving plane
method, which we call "moving plane method without assuming smoothness" - where smoothness and
symmetry are established in tandem.
