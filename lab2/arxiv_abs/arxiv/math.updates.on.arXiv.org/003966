Matching pursuit, especially its orthogonal version and other variations, is a greedy algorithm
widely used in signal processing, compressed sensing, and sparse modeling and approximation.
Inspired by constrained sparse signal recovery, this paper proposes a constrained matching pursuit
algorithm and develops conditions for exact support and vector recovery on constraint sets via
this algorithm. We show that exact recovery via constrained matching pursuit not only depends on
a measurement matrix but also critically relies on a constraint set. We thus identify an important
class of constraint sets, called coordinate projection admissible set, or simply CP admissible
sets. This class of sets includes the Euclidean space, the nonnegative orthant, and many others
arising from various applications; analytic and geometric properties of these sets are established.
We then study exact vector recovery on convex, CP admissible cones for a fixed support. We provide
sufficient exact recovery conditions for a general fixed support as well as necessary and sufficient
recovery conditions for a fixed support of small size. As a byproduct of our results, we construct
a nontrivial counterexample to the necessary conditions of exact vector recovery via the orthogonal
matching pursuit given by Foucart, Rauhut, and Tropp, when the a given support is of size three. Moreover,
by making use of cone properties and conic hull structure of CP admissible sets and constrained optimization
techniques, we also establish sufficient conditions for uniform exact recovery on CP admissible
sets in terms of the restricted isometry-like constant and the restricted orthogonality-like
constant.
