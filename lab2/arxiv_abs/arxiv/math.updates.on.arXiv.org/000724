Contrary to the case of the irreducible polynomials of degree $m$ over a finite field, say $\mathbb{F}_q$,
up to present there are no known (to the knowledge of the authors) explicit formulas for the number
of primitive polynomials of degree $m$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with a prescribed coefficient. For
instance, whereas the number of irreducible polynomials with a prescribed trace coefficient (the
coefficient of $x^{m-1}$) can be described by a simple beautiful formula due to Carlitz, no analogue
is known in the case of primitives, even in any specific non-trivial case. In this paper we derive
an explicit formula for the number of primitive elements, in quartic extensions of Mersenne prime
fields, having absolute trace zero. We also give a simple formula in the case when $Q = (q^m-1)/(q-1)$
is prime. More generally, in the former case, for a positive integer $N$ whose prime factors divide
$Q$ and satisfy the so called semi-primitive condition, we give an explicit formula for the number
of $N$-free elements with trace zero. In addition we show that if all the prime factors of $q-1$ divide
$m$, then the number of primitive elements in $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, with prescribed non-zero trace,
is uniformly distributed. Finally we explore the related number, $P_{q, q^m}(N,c)$, of elements
in $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ with multiplicative order $N$ and having trace $c \in \mathbb{F}_q$. By
showing a connection between $N$-free and order in the special case when $L_Q \mid N$, where $L_Q$
is the largest divisor of $q^m-1$ with the same radical as that of $Q$, we are able to derive the number
of elements in $\mathbb{F}_{p^4}$, $p$ being a Mersenne prime, with absolute trace zero and having
the corresponding large order $L_Q$.
