Wireless sensors can integrate rechargeable batteries and energy-harvesting (EH) devices to
enable long-term, autonomous operation, thus requiring intelligent energy management to limit
the adverse impact of energy outages. This work considers a network of EH wireless sensors, which
report packets with random utility value to a fusion center (FC) over a shared wireless channel.
We design decentralized access schemes, where each node performs a local decision to transmit/discard
the packet, based on an estimate of the packet's utility, its own energy level, and the scenario state
of the EH process, with the objective to maximize the average long-term aggregate utility of the
packets received at the FC. Due to the non-convex structure of the problem, we develop an approximate
optimization by resorting to a mathematical artifice based on a game theoretic formulation of the
multiaccess problem, where the nodes do not behave strategically, but rather attempt to maximize
a common network utility with respect to their own policy. We characterize the symmetric Nash-equilibrium
(SNE), where all nodes employ the same policy, we prove its uniqueness, and show that it is a local
maximum of the original problem. We present an algorithm to compute the SNE and propose a heuristic
scheme, which is optimal for large battery capacity. We show numerically that the SNE achieves near-optimal
performance, within 3% of the optimal policy, at a fraction of the complexity, and identify two operational
regimes of EH-networks: an energy-limited scenario, where energy is scarce and the channel is under-utilized,
and a network-limited scenario, where energy is abundant and the shared wireless channel represents
the bottleneck of the system.
