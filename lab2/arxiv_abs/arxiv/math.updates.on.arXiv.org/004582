We introduce and study the class of linear transfers between probability distributions and the
dual class of Kantorovich operators between function spaces. Linear transfers can be seen as an
extension of convex lower semi-continuous energies on Wasserstein space, of cost minimizing mass
transports, as well as many other couplings between probability measures to which Monge-Kantorovich
theory does not readily apply. Basic examples include balayage of measures, martingale transports,
optimal Skorokhod embeddings, and the weak mass transports of Talagrand, Marton, Gozlan and others.
The class also includes various stochastic mass transports such as the Schr\"odinger bridge associated
to a reversible Markov process, and the Arnold-Brenier variational principle for the incompressible
Euler equations. We associate to most linear transfers, a critical constant, a corresponding effective
linear transfer and additive eigenfunctions to their dual Kantorovich operators, that extend
Man\'e's critical value, Aubry-Mather invariant tori, and Fathi's weak KAM solutions for Hamiltonian
systems. This amounts to studying the asymptotic properties of the nonlinear Kantorovich operators
as opposed to classical ergodic theory, which deals with linear Markov operators. This allows for
the extension of Mather theory to other settings such as its stochastic counterpart. We also introduce
the class of convex transfers, which includes $p$-powers ($ p \geq 1$) of linear transfers, the logarithmic
entropy, the Donsker-Varadhan information, optimal mean field plans, and certain free energies
as functions of two probability measures, i.e., where the reference measure is also a variable.
Duality formulae for general transfer inequalities follow in a very natural way. This paper is an
expanded version of a previously posted but not published work by the authors.
