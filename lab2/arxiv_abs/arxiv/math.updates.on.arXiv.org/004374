We develop a novel data-driven robust model predictive control (DDRMPC) approach for automatic
control of irrigation systems. The fundamental idea is to integrate both mechanistic models, which
describe dynamics in soil moisture variations, and data-driven models, which characterize uncertainty
in forecast errors of evapotranspiration and precipitation, into a holistic systems control framework.
To better capture the support of uncertainty distribution, we take a new learning-based approach
by constructing uncertainty sets from historical data. For evapotranspiration forecast error,
the support vector clustering-based uncertainty set is adopted, which can be conveniently built
from historical data. As for precipitation forecast errors, we analyze the dependence of their
distribution on forecast values, and further design a tailored uncertainty set based on the properties
of this type of uncertainty. In this way, the overall uncertainty distribution can be elaborately
described, which finally contributes to rational and efficient control decisions. To assure the
quality of data-driven uncertainty sets, a training-calibration scheme is used to provide theoretical
performance guarantees. A generalized affine decision rule is adopted to obtain tractable approximations
of optimal control problems, thereby ensuring the practicability of DDRMPC. Case studies using
real data show that, DDRMPC can reliably maintain soil moisture above the safety level and avoid
crop devastation. The proposed DDRMPC approach leads to a 40% reduction of total water consumption
compared to the fine-tuned open-loop control strategy. In comparison with the carefully tuned
rule-based control and certainty equivalent model predictive control, the proposed DDRMPC approach
can significantly reduce the total water consumption and improve the control performance.
