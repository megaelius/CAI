The Cuntz semigroup of a C*-algebra is an important invariant in the structure and classification
theory of C*-algebras. It captures more information than K-theory but is often more delicate to
handle. We systematically study the lattice and category theoretic aspects of Cuntz semigroups.
Given a C*-algebra $A$, its (concrete) Cuntz semigroup $Cu(A)$ is an object in the category $Cu$
of (abstract) Cuntz semigroups, as introduced by Coward, Elliott and Ivanescu. To clarify the distinction
between concrete and abstract Cuntz semigroups, we will call the latter $Cu$-semigroups. We establish
the existence of tensor products in the category $Cu$ and study the basic properties of this construction.
We show that $Cu$ is a symmetric, monoidal category and relate $Cu(A\otimes B)$ with $Cu(A)\otimes_{Cu}Cu(B)$
for certain classes of C*-algebras. As a main tool for our approach we introduce the category $W$
of pre-completed Cuntz semigroups. We show that $Cu$ is a full, reflective subcategory of $W$. One
can then easily deduce properties of $Cu$ from respective properties of $W$, e.g. the existence
of tensor products and inductive limits. The advantage is that constructions in $W$ are much easier
since the objects are purely algebraic. We also develop a theory of $Cu$-semirings and their semimodules.
The Cuntz semigroup of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra has a natural product giving it the
structure of a $Cu$-semiring. We give explicit characterizations of $Cu$-semimodules over such
$Cu$-semirings. For instance, we show that a $Cu$-semigroup $S$ tensorially absorbs the $Cu$-semiring
of the Jiang-Su algebra if and only if $S$ is almost unperforated and almost divisible, thus establishing
a semigroup version of the Toms-Winter conjecture.
