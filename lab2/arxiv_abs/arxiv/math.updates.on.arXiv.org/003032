Light-fidelity (LiFi) is a networked optical wireless communication (OWC) solution for high-speed
indoor connectivity for fixed and mobile optical communications. Unlike conventional radio frequency
wireless systems, the OWC channel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects
the channel gain significantly, particularly for mobile users. However, due to the lack of a proper
model for device orientation, many studies have assumed that the receiver is vertically upward
and fixed. In this paper, a novel model for device orientation based on experimental measurements
of forty participants has been proposed. It is shown that the probability density function (PDF)
of the polar angle can be modeled either based on a Laplace (for static users) or a Gaussian (for mobile
users) distribution. In addition, a closed-form expression is obtained for the PDF of the cosine
of the incidence angle based on which line-of-sight (LOS) channel gain is described in OWC channels.
An approximation of this PDF based on the truncated Laplace is proposed and the accuracy of this approximation
is confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KSD). Moreover, the statistics of the LOS channel
gain are calculated and the random orientation of a user equipment (UE) is modeled as a random process.
The influence of the random orientation on signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) performance of OWC systems
has been evaluated. Finally, an orientation-based random waypoint (ORWP) mobility model is proposed
by considering the random orientation of the UE during the user's movement. The performance of ORWP
is assessed on the handover rate and it is shown that it is important to take the random orientation
into account.
