This paper develops and analyzes a fully discrete finite element method for a class of semilinear
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise. The nonlinearity
in the diffusion term of the SPDEs is assumed to be globally Lipschitz and the nonlinearity in the
drift term is only assumed to satisfy a one-side Lipschitz condition. The semilinear SPDEs considered
in this paper is a direct generalization of the SODEs considered in [13]. There are several difficulties
which need to be overcome for this generalization. First, obviously the spatial discretization,
which does not appear in the SODE case, adds an extra layer of difficulty. It turns out a special discretization
must be designed to guarantee certain properties for the numerical scheme and its stiffness matrix.
In this paper we use a finite element interpolation technique to discretize the nonlinear drift
term. Second, in order to prove the strong convergence of the proposed fully discrete finite element
method, stability estimates for higher order moments of the $H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution
must be established, which are difficult and delicate. A judicious combination of the properties
of the drift and diffusion terms and a nontrivial technique borrowed from [16] is used in this paper
to achieve the goal. Finally, stability estimates for the second and higher order moments of the
$L^2$-norm of the numerical solution is also difficult to obtain due to the fact that the mass matrix
may not be diagonally dominant. This is done by utilizing the interpolation theory and the higher
moment estimates for the $H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution. After overcoming these difficulties,
it is proved that the proposed fully discrete finite element method is convergent in strong norms
with nearly optimal rates of convergence.
