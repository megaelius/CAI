In classical General Relativity, the values of fields on spacetime are uniquely determined by their
values at an initial time within the domain of dependence of this initial data surface. However,
it may occur that the spacetime under consideration extends beyond this domain of dependence, and
fields, therefore, are not entirely determined by their initial data. This occurs, for example,
in the well-known (maximally) extended Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Reissner-Nordstr\"om-deSitter
(RNdS) spacetimes. The boundary of the region determined by the initial data is called the "Cauchy
horizon." It is located inside the black hole in these spacetimes. The strong cosmic censorship
conjecture asserts that the Cauchy horizon does not, in fact, exist in practice because the slightest
perturbation (of the metric itself or the matter fields) will become singular there in a sufficiently
catastrophic way that solutions cannot be extended beyond the Cauchy horizon. Thus, if strong cosmic
censorship holds, the Cauchy horizon will be converted into a "final singularity," and determinism
will hold. Recently, however, it has been found that, classically this is not the case in RNdS spacetimes
in a certain range of mass, charge, and cosmological constant. In this paper, we consider a quantum
scalar field in RNdS spacetime and show that quantum theory comes to the rescue of strong cosmic censorship.
We find that for any state that is nonsingular (i.e., Hadamard) within the domain of dependence,
the expected stress-tensor blows up with affine parameter, $V$, along a radial null geodesic transverse
to the Cauchy horizon as $T_{VV} \sim C/V^2$ with $C$ independent of the state and $C \neq 0$ generically
in RNdS spacetimes. This divergence is stronger than in the classical theory and should be sufficient
to convert the Cauchy horizon into a strong curvature singularity.
