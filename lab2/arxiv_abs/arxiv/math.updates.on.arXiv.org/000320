A central aim of relativistic quantum information (RQI) is the investigation of quantum information
tasks and resources taking into account the relativistic aspects of nature. More precisely, it
is of fundamental interest to understand how the storage, manipulation, and transmission of information
utilizing quantum systems are influenced by the fact that these processes take place in a relativistic
spacetime. In particular, many studies in RQI have been focused on the effects of non-uniform motion
on entanglement, the main resource of quantum information protocols. Early investigations in
this direction were performed in highly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical
accessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it is necessary to consider quantum
systems that are in principle accessible to localized observers. In this thesis we present such
a model, the rigid relativistic cavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects of motion on
entanglement and applications such as quantum teleportation. We study cavities in (1+1) dimensions
undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform acceleration and inertial motion
of arbitrary duration that allow the involved velocities to become relativistic. The transitions
between segments can be sharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus
lies in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar fields or Dirac fields,
confined to the cavities. The Bogoliubov transformations change the particle content and the occupation
of the energy levels of the cavity. We show how these effects generate entanglement between the modes
of the quantum fields inside a single cavity for various initial states. The entanglement between
several cavities, on the other hand, is degraded by the non-uniform motion, influencing the fidelity
of tasks such as teleportation.
