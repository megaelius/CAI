In the existing cellular networks, it remains a challenging problem to communicate with and control
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm with both high reliability and low latency. Due to the UAV
swarm's high working altitude and strong ground-to-air channels, it is generally exposed to multiple
ground base stations (GBSs), while the GBSs that are serving ground users (occupied GBSs) can generate
strong interference to the UAV swarm. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel two-phase transmission
protocol by exploiting cellular plus device-to-device (D2D) communication for the UAV swarm.
In Phase I, one swarm head is chosen for ground-to-air channel estimation, and all the GBSs that are
not serving ground users (available GBSs) transmit a common control message to the UAV swarm simultaneously,
using the same cellular frequency band, to combat the strong interference from occupied GBSs. In
Phase II, all the UAVs that have decoded the common control message in Phase I further relay it to the
other UAVs in the swarm via D2D communication, by exploiting the less interfered D2D frequency band
and the proximity among UAVs. In this paper, we aim to characterize the reliability performance
of the above two-phase protocol, i.e., the expected percentage of UAVs in the swarm that can decode
the common control message, which is a non-trivial problem due to the complex system setup and the
intricate coupling between the two phases. Nevertheless, we manage to obtain an approximated expression
of the reliability performance of interest, under reasonable assumptions and with the aid of the
Pearson distributions. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our analytical results and
show the effectiveness of our protocol over other benchmark protocols. We also study the effect
of key system parameters on the reliability performance, to reveal useful insights on the practical
system design.
