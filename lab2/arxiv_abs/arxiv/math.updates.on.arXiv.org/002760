The Kuramoto model of a system of coupled phase oscillators and its many variations are frequently
used to describe synchronization phenomena in nature. This paper proposes a novel generalization
of the Kuramoto model where each oscillator state lives on the embedding of the compact Stiefel manifold
$\mathsf{St}(p,n)$ in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$. Previous work on high-dimensional
Kuramoto models have largely been influenced by results and techniques that pertain to the original
model. This paper uses techniques from the fields of optimization and control theory to prove a fundamental
convergence result: the generalized Kuramoto model on $\mathsf{St}(p,n)$ converges to a completely
synchronized state for any connected interaction topology and from almost all initial conditions
provided the pair $(p,n)$ satisfies $p\leq \tfrac23n-1$ and all oscillator frequencies are equal.
This result is unexpected since it could not have been predicted based on knowledge of the Kuramoto
model in complex networks on the circle $\mathsf{S}^1$ with homogeneous oscillator frequencies.
In that case, almost global synchronization is graph dependent; it applies if the interaction topology
is given by an acyclic or a sufficiently dense graph. In fact, the problem of characterizing all $\mathsf{S}^1$-synchronizing
graphs is still open. This paper hence identifies a key distinguishing property of many high-dimensional
generalizations of the Kuramoto model which should have important implications for both modeling
and analysis of synchronization phenomena in physics and multi-agent consensus in engineering
applications.
