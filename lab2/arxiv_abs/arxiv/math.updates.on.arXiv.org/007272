While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life in today's ever-connected
world, social distancing has recently received much public attention on its importance since the
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature
among solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or slowing down the
spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social distancing problem for how a population,
when in a world with a network of social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding
or closing down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be minimized. We model
this problem as a network population game, where every individual tries to find some network sites
to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy
can be found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large class of equilibrium
strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular
subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct,
and can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or allow certain degree
of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions
of these strategies, and analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular
subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different contact values are assigned
to different network sites.
