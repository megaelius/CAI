We shall discuss the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem for: $f(x,u, Du, D^2u) = \psi(x)$ where $f$
is a "natural" differential operator, with a restricted domain $F$, on a manifold $X$. By "natural"
we mean operators that arise intrinsically from a given geometry on $X$. An important point is that
the equation need not be convex and can be highly degenerate. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous term
can take values at the boundary of the restricted domain $F$ of the operator $f$. A simple example
is the real Monge-Amp\`ere operator ${\rm det}({\rm Hess}\,u) = \psi(x)$ on a riemannian manifold
$X$, where ${\rm Hess}$ is the riemannian Hessian, the restricted domain is $F = \{{\rm Hess} \geq
0\}$, and $\psi$ is continuous with $\psi\geq0$. A main new tool is the idea of local jet-equivalence,
which gives rise to local weak comparison, and then to comparison under a natural and necessary global
assumption. The main theorem applies to pairs $(F,f)$, which are locally jet-equivalent to a given
constant coefficient pair $({\bf F}, {\bf f})$. This covers a large family of geometric equations
on manifolds: orthogonally invariant operators on a riemannian manifold, G-invariant operators
on manifolds with G-structure, operators on almost complex manifolds, and operators, such as the
Lagrangian Monge-Amp\`ere operator, on symplectic manifolds. It also applies to all branches
of these operators. Complete existence and uniqueness results are established with existence
requiring the same boundary assumptions as in the homogeneous case [10]. We also have results where
the inhomogeneous term $\psi$ is a delta function.
