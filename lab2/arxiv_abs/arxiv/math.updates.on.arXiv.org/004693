We consider the problem of rigid registration, where we wish to jointly register multiple point
sets via rigid transforms. This arises in applications such as sensor network localization, multiview
registration, and protein structure determination. The least-squares estimator for this problem
can be reduced to a rank-constrained semidefinite program (REG-SDP). It was recently shown that
by formally applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we can derive an iterative
solver (REG-ADMM) for REG-SDP, wherein each subproblem admits a simple closed-form solution.
The empirical success of REG-ADMM has been demonstrated for multiview registration. However,
its convergence does not follow from the existing literature on nonconvex ADMM. In this work, we
study the convergence of REG-ADMM and our main findings are as follows. We prove that any fixed point
of REG-ADMM is a stationary (KKT) point of REG-SDP. Moreover, for clean measurements, we give an
explicit formula for the ADMM parameter $\rho$, for which REG-ADMM is guaranteed to converge to
the global optimum (with arbitrary initialization). If the noise is low, we can still show that the
iterates converge to the global optimum, provided they are initialized sufficiently close to the
optimum. On the other hand, if the noise is high, we explain why REG-ADMM becomes unstable if $\rho$
is less than some threshold, irrespective of the initialization. We present simulation results
to support our theoretical predictions. The novelty of our analysis lies in the fact that we exploit
the notion of tightness of convex relaxation to arrive at our convergence results.
