We consider the stochastic heat equation (SHE) on $\mathbb R^d$ with multiplicative space-time
white noise smoothened in space. In this model, the Feynman-Kac representation of the solution
defines an underlying {\it{Gaussian multiplicative chaos}} (GMC) measure on the Wiener space.
For $d\geq 3$, the solution of the SHE is known to undergo a phase transition as the smoothing parameter
vanishes. It was shown in \cite{MSZ16} that for small noise intensity, the solutions converge to
a strictly positive random variable, while larger disorder strength (i.e., low temperature) forces
the total mass of the underlying GMC to lose uniform integrability and eventually produces a vanishing
limit for the solution as the smoothing parameter vanishes. Inspired by strong localization phenomena
for log-correlated Gaussian fields and Gaussian multiplicative chaos in the finite dimensional
Euclidean spaces (\cite{MRV16}), and related results for discrete directed polymers (\cite{V07,BC16}),
we study the endpoint distribution of a Brownian path under the {\it{renormalized}} GMC measure
in the Wiener space. We show that in the low temperature regime, the energy landscape of the system
freezes and enters the so called {\it{glassy phase}} as the entire mass of the Ces\`aro average of
the endpoint GMC distribution stays localized in few spatial islands in the limit, forcing the endpoint
GMC to be {\it{asymptotically purely atomic}} (\cite{V07}). The method of our proof is based on
the translation-invariant compactification introduced in \cite{MV14} and a fixed point approach
related to the cavity method from spin glasses recently used in \cite{BC16} in the context of the
directed polymer model in the lattice.
