The area of Data Analytics on graphs promises a paradigm shift as we approach information processing
of classes of data, which are typically acquired on irregular but structured domains (social networks,
various ad-hoc sensor networks). Yet, despite its long history, current approaches mostly focus
on the optimization of graphs themselves, rather than on directly inferring learning strategies,
such as detection, estimation, statistical and probabilistic inference, clustering and separation
from signals and data acquired on graphs. To fill this void, we first revisit graph topologies from
a Data Analytics point of view, and establish a taxonomy of graph networks through a linear algebraic
formalism of graph topology (vertices, connections, directivity). This serves as a basis for spectral
analysis of graphs, whereby the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph Laplacian and adjacency
matrices are shown to convey physical meaning related to both graph topology and higher-order graph
properties, such as cuts, walks, paths, and neighborhoods. Next, to illustrate estimation strategies
performed on graph signals, spectral analysis of graphs is introduced through eigenanalysis of
mathematical descriptors of graphs and in a generic way. Finally, a framework for vertex clustering
and graph segmentation is established based on graph spectral representation (eigenanalysis)
which illustrates the power of graphs in various data association tasks. The supporting examples
demonstrate the promise of Graph Data Analytics in modeling structural and functional/semantic
inferences. At the same time, Part I serves as a basis for Part II and Part III which deal with theory,
methods and applications of processing Data on Graphs and Graph Topology Learning from data.
