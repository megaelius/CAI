The distributed computation of equilibria and optima has seen growing interest in a broad collection
of networked problems. We consider the computation of equilibria of convex stochastic Nash games
characterized by a possibly nonconvex potential function. Our focus is on two classes of stochastic
Nash games: (P1): A potential stochastic Nash game, in which each player solves a parameterized
stochastic convex program; and (P2): A misspecified generalization, where the player-specific
stochastic program is complicated by a parametric misspecification. In both settings, exact proximal
BR solutions are generally unavailable in finite time since they necessitate solving parameterized
stochastic programs. Consequently, we design two asynchronous inexact proximal BR schemes to
solve the problems, where in each iteration a single player is randomly chosen to compute an inexact
proximal BR solution with rivals' possibly outdated information. Yet, in the misspecified regime
(P2), each player possesses an extra estimate of the misspecified parameter and updates its estimate
by a projected stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm. By Since any stationary point of the potential
function is a Nash equilibrium of the associated game, we believe this paper is amongst the first
ones for stochastic nonconvex (but block convex) optimization problems equipped with almost-sure
convergence guarantees. These statements can be extended to allow for accommodating weighted
potential games and generalized potential games. Finally, we present preliminary numerics based
on applying the proposed schemes to congestion control and Nash-Cournot games.
