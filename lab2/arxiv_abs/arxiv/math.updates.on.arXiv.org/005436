In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with
degenerate viscosities (\textbf{ICND}) is considered in both the whole space and the periodic
domain. First, for the corresponding Cauchy problem, when shear and bulk viscosity coefficients
are both given as a constant multiple of the density's power ($\rho^\delta$ with $0<\delta<1$),
based on some elaborate analysis of this system's intrinsic singular structures, we show that the
$L^\infty$ norm of the deformation tensor $D(u)$ and the $L^6$ norm of $\nabla \rho^{\delta-1}$
control the possible breakdown of regular solutions with far field vacuum. This conclusion means
that if a solution with far field vacuum of the \textbf{ICND} system is initially regular and loses
its regularity at some later time, then the formation of singularity must be caused by losing the
bound of $D(u)$ or $\nabla \rho^{\delta-1}$ as the critical time approaches. Second, under the
additional assumption that the shear and second viscosities (respectively $\mu(\rho)$ and $\lambda(\rho)$)
satisfy the BD relation $\lambda(\rho)=2(\mu'(\rho)\rho-\mu(\rho))$, if we consider the corresponding
problem in some periodic domain and the initial density is away from the vacuum, it can be proved that
the possible breakdown of classical solutions can be controlled only by the $L^\infty$ norm of $D(u)$.
It is worth pointing out that, except the conclusions mentioned above, another purpose of the current
paper is to show how to understand the intrinsic singular structures of the fluid system considered
now, and then how to develop the corresponding nonlinear energy estimates in the specially designed
energy space with singular weights for the unique regular solution with finite energy.
