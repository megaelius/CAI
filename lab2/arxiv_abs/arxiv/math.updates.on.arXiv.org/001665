In this paper, we propose closed-form precoding schemes with optimal performance for constructive
interference (CI) exploitation in the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink.
We first consider an optimization where we maximize the distance between the constructive region
and the detection thresholds. The cases of both strict and non-strict phase rotation are considered
and can further be formulated as convex optimization problems. For optimization with strict phase
rotation, we mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure with Lagrangian and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) conditions. By formulating its dual problem, the optimization problem is further shown to
be equivalent to a quadratic programming (QP) over a simplex, which can be solved more efficiently.
We then extend our analysis to the case of non-strict phase rotation, where it is mathematically
shown that a K-dimensional optimization for non-strict phase rotation is equivalent to a 2K-dimensional
optimization for strict phase rotation in terms of the problem formulation. The connection with
the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) precoding is also discussed. Based on the above analysis, we
further propose an iterative closed-form scheme to obtain the optimal beamforming matrix, where
within each iteration a closed-form solution can be obtained. Numerical results validate our analysis
and the optimality of the proposed iterative scheme, and further show that the proposed closed-form
scheme is more efficient than the conventional QP algorithms with interior-point methods, which
motivates the use of CI beamforming in practical wireless systems.
