We present a convex optimization framework for bounding extreme events in nonlinear dynamical
systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations (ODEs or PDEs). This framework
bounds from above the largest value of an observable along trajectories that start from a chosen
set and evolve over a finite or infinite time interval. Our approach needs no explicit trajectories.
Instead, it requires constructing suitably constrained auxiliary functions that depend on the
state variables and possibly on time. Minimizing bounds over auxiliary functions a is a convex problem
dual to the non-convex maximization of the observable along trajectories. We prove that this duality
is strong, meaning that auxiliary functions give arbitrarily sharp bounds, for sufficiently regular
ODEs evolving over a finite time on a compact domain. When the conditions of this theorem fail, strong
duality may or may not hold; both situations are illustrated by examples. We also show that near-optimal
auxiliary functions can be used to construct spacetime sets that localize trajectories leading
to extreme events. Finally, in the case of polynomial ODEs and observables, we describe how polynomial
auxiliary functions of fixed degree can be optimized numerically using polynomial optimization.
These computed bounds become sharp as the polynomial degree is raised if strong duality and mild
compactness assumptions hold. Analytical and computational ODE examples illustrate the construction
of bounds and the identification of extreme trajectories, along with some limitations. As an analytical
PDE example, we bound the maximum fractional enstrophy of solutions to the Burgers equation with
fractional dissipation.
