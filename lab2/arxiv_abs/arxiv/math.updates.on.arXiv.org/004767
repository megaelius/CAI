The multigroup neutron transport criticality calculations using modern supercomputers have
been widely employed in a nuclear reactor analysis for studying whether or not a system is self-sustaining.
However, the design and development of an efficient parallel algorithm for the transport criticality
calculations is a challenging task especially when the number of processor cores is large and the
unstructured mesh is adopted since both the compute time and the memory usage need to be taken into
consideration. In this paper, we study a monolithic multilevel Schwarz preconditioner for the
transport criticality calculations using the nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA). In NDA,
the linear systems of equations arising from the discretizations of the nonlinear diffusion equations
and the transport equations need to be efficiently solved. To achieve this goal, we propose a monolithically
coupled approach equipped with several important ingredients; e.g., subspace-based coarsening,
aggressive coarsening and strength matrix thresholding. The proposed monolithic multilevel
method is capable of efficiently handling the linear systems of equations for both the transport
system and the diffusion system. In the multilevel method, the construction of coarse spaces is
nontrivial and expensive. We propose a subspace-based coarsening algorithm to resolve this issue
by exploring the matrix structures of the transport equations and the nonlinear diffusion equations.
We numerically demonstrate that the monolithic multilevel preconditioner with the subspace-based
coarsening algorithm is twice as fast as that equipped with a full space based coarsening approach
on thousands of processor cores for an unstructured mesh neutron transport problem with billions
of unknowns.
