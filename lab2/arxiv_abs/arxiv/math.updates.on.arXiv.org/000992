We consider the problem of convergence to a saddle point of a concave-convex function via gradient
dynamics. Since first introduced by Arrow, Hurwicz and Uzawa in [1] such dynamics have been extensively
used in diverse areas, there are, however, features that render their analysis non trivial. These
include the lack of convergence guarantees when the function considered is not strictly concave-convex
and also the non-smoothness of subgradient dynamics. Our aim in this two part paper is to provide
an explicit characterization to the asymptotic behaviour of general gradient and subgradient
dynamics applied to a general concave-convex function. We show that despite the nonlinearity and
non-smoothness of these dynamics their $\omega$-limit set is comprised of trajectories that solve
only explicit linear ODEs that are characterized within the paper. More precisely, in Part I an exact
characterization is provided to the asymptotic behaviour of unconstrained gradient dynamics.
We also show that when convergence to a saddle point is not guaranteed then the system behaviour can
be problematic, with arbitrarily small noise leading to an unbounded variance. In Part II we consider
a general class of subgradient dynamics that restrict trajectories in an arbitrary convex domain,
and show that their limiting trajectories are solutions of subgradient dynamics on only affine
subspaces. The latter is a smooth class of dynamics with an asymptotic behaviour exactly characterized
in Part I, as solutions to explicit linear ODEs. These results are used to formulate corresponding
convergence criteria and are demonstrated with several examples and applications presented in
Part II.
