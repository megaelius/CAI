Given a smooth projective variety $M$ endowed with a faithful action of a finite group $G$, following
Jarvis-Kaufmann-Kimura and Fantechi-G\"ottsche, we define the orbifold motive (or Chen-Ruan
motive) of the quotient stack $[M/G]$ as an algebra object in the category of Chow motives. Inspired
by Ruan, one can formulate a motivic version of his Cohomological HyperK\"ahler Resolution Conjecture.
We prove this motivic version, as well as its K-theoretic analogue conjectured by Jarvis-Kaufmann-Kimura,
in two situations related to an abelian surface $A$ and a positive integer $n$. Case (A) concerns
Hilbert schemes of points of $A$ : the Chow motive of $A^{[n]}$ is isomorphic as algebra objects,
up to a suitable sign change, to the orbifold motive of the quotient stack $[A^{n}/\mathfrak{S}_{n}]$.
Case (B) for generalized Kummer varieties : the Chow motive of the generalized Kummer variety $K_n(A)$
is isomorphic as algebra objects, up to a suitable sign change, to the orbifold motive of the quotient
stack $[A_{0}^{n+1}/\mathfrak {S}_{n+1}]$, where $A_{0}^{n+1}$ is the kernel abelian variety
of the summation map $A^{n+1}\to A$. As a byproduct, we prove the original Cohomological HyperK\"ahler
Resolution Conjecture for generalized Kummer varieties. As an application, we provide multiplicative
Chow-K\"unneth decompositions for Hilbert schemes of abelian surfaces and for generalized Kummer
varieties. In particular, we have a multiplicative direct sum decomposition of their Chow rings
with rational coefficients, which is expected to be the splitting of the conjectural Bloch-Beilinson-Murre
filtration. The existence of such a splitting for holomorphic symplectic varieties is conjectured
by Beauville.
