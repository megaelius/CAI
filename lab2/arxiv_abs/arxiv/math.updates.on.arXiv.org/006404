Consider a subshift over a finite alphabet, $X\subset \Lambda^{\mathbb Z}$ (or $X\subset\Lambda^{\mathbb
N_0}$). With each finite block $B\in\Lambda^k$ appearing in $X$ we associate the empirical measure
ascribing to every block $C\in\Lambda^l$ the frequency of occurrences of $C$ in $B$. By comparing
the values ascribed to blocks $C$ we define a metric on the combined space of blocks $B$ and probability
measures $\mu$ on $X$, whose restriction to the space of measures is compatible with the weak-$\star$
topology. Next, in this combined metric space we fix an open set $\mathcal U$ containing all ergodic
measures, and we say that a block $B$ is "ergodic" if $B\in\mathcal U$. In this paper we prove the following
main result: Given $\varepsilon>0$, every $x\in X$ decomposes as a concatenation of blocks of bounded
lengths in such a way that, after ignoring a set $M$ of coordinates of upper Banach density smaller
than $\varepsilon$, all blocks in the decomposition are ergodic. The second main result concerns
subshifts whose set of ergodic measures is closed. We show that, in this case, no matter how $x\in
X$ is partitioned into blocks (as long as their lengths are sufficiently large and bounded), after
ignoring a set $M$ of upper Banach density smaller than $\varepsilon$, all blocks in the decomposition
are ergodic. The first half of the paper is concluded by examples showing, among other things, that
the small set $M$, in both main theorems, cannot be avoided. The second half of the paper is devoted
to generalizing the two main results described above to subshifts $X\subset\Lambda^G$ with the
action of a countable amenable group $G$. The role of long blocks is played by blocks whose domains
are members of a F\o lner sequence while the decomposition of $x\in X$ into blocks (of which majority
is ergodic) is obtained with the help of a congruent system of tilings.
