We investigate whether a generic multipartite pure state can be the unique asymptotic steady state
of locality-constrained purely dissipative Markovian dynamics. In the simplest tripartite setting,
we show that the problem is equivalent to characterizing the solution space of a set of linear equations
and establish that the set of pure states obeying the above property has either measure zero or measure
one, solely depending on the subsystems' dimension. A complete analytical characterization is
given when the central subsystem is a qubit. In the N-partite case, we provide conditions on the subsystems'
size and the nature of the locality constraint, under which random pure states cannot be quasi-locally
stabilized generically. Beside allowing for the possibility to approximately stabilize entangled
pure states that cannot be exact steady states in settings where stabilizability is generic, our
results offer insights into the extent to which random pure states may arise as unique ground states
of frustration free parent Hamiltonians. We further argue that, to high probability, pure quantum
states sampled from a t-design enjoy the same stabilizability properties of Haar-random ones as
long as suitable dimension constraints are obeyed and t is sufficiently large. Lastly, we demonstrate
a connection between the tasks of quasi-local state stabilization and unique state reconstruction
from local tomographic information, and provide a constructive procedure for determining a generic
N-partite pure state based only on knowledge of the support of any two of the reduced density matrices
of about half the parties, improving over existing results.
