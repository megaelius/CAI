Here we study the spectral properties of an underlying weighted graph of a non-uniform hypergraph
by introducing different connectivity matrices, such as adjacency, Laplacian and normalized
Laplacian matrices. We show that different structural properties of a hypergrpah, can be well studied
using spectral properties of these matrices. Connectivity of a hypergraph is also investigated
by the eigenvalues of these operators. Spectral radii of the same are bounded by the degrees of a hypergraph.
The diameter of a hypergraph is also bounded by the eigenvalues of its connectivity matrices. We
characterize different properties of a regular hypergraph characterized by the spectrum. Strong
(vertex) chromatic number of a hypergraph is bounded by the eigenvalues. Cheeger constant on a hypergraph
is defined and we show that it can be bounded by the smallest nontrivial eigenvalues of Laplacian
matrix and normalized Laplacian matrix, respectively, of a connected hypergraph. We also show
an approach to study random walk on a (non-uniform) hypergraph that can be performed by analyzing
the spectrum of transition probability operator which is defined on that hypergraph. Ricci curvature
on hypergraphs is introduced in two different ways. We show that if the Laplace operator, $\Delta$,
on a hypergraph satisfies a curvature-dimension type inequality $CD (\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{K})$
with $\mathbf{m}>1 $ and $\mathbf{K}>0 $ then any non-zero eigenvalue of $- \Delta$ can be bounded
below by $ \frac{ \mathbf{m} \mathbf{K}}{ \mathbf{m} -1 } $. Eigenvalues of a normalized Laplacian
operator defined on a connected hypergraph can be bounded by the Ollivier's Ricci curvature of the
hypergraph.
