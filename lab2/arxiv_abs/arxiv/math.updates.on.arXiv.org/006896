Motivated in part by online marketplaces such as ridesharing and freelancing platforms, we study
two-sided matching markets where agents are heterogeneous in their compatibility with different
types of jobs: flexible agents can fulfill any job, whereas each specialized agent can only be matched
to a specific subset of jobs. When the set of jobs compatible with each agent is known, the full-information
first-best throughput (i.e. number of matches) can be achieved by prioritizing dispatch of specialized
agents as much as possible. When agents are strategic, however, we show that such aggressive reservation
of flexible capacity incentivizes flexible agents to pretend to be specialized. The resulting
equilibrium throughput could be even lower than the outcome under a baseline policy, which does
not reserve flexible capacity, and simply dispatches jobs to agents at random. To balance matching
efficiency with agents' strategic considerations, we introduce a novel robust capacity reservation
policy (RCR). The RCR policy retains a similar structure to the first best policy, but offers additional
and seemingly incompatible edges along which jobs can be dispatched. We show a Braess' paradox-like
result, that offering these additional edges could sometimes lead to worse equilibrium outcomes.
Nevertheless, we prove that under any market conditions, and regardless of agents' strategies,
the proposed RCR policy always achieves higher throughput than the baseline policy. Our work highlights
the importance of considering the interplay between strategic behavior and capacity allocation
policies in service systems.
