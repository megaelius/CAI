The paper aim is the axiomatic justification of the theory of experience and chance, one of the dual
halves of which is the Kolmogorov probability theory. The author's main idea was the natural inclusion
of Kolmogorov's axiomatics of probability theory in a number of general concepts of the theory of
experience and chance. The analogy between the measure of a set and the probability of an event has
become clear for a long time. This analogy also allows further evolution: the measure of a set is completely
analogous to the believability of an event. In order to postulate the theory of experience and chance
on the basis of this analogy, you just need to add to the Kolmogorov probability theory its dual reflection
- the believability theory, so that the theory of experience and chance could be postulated as the
certainty (believability-probability) theory on the Cartesian product of the probability and
believability spaces, and the central concept of the theory is the new notion of co~event as a measurable
binary relation on the Cartesian product of sets of elementary incomes and elementary outcomes.
Attempts to build the foundations of the theory of experience and chance from this general point
of view are unknown to me, and the whole range of ideas presented here has not yet acquired popularity
even in a narrow circle of specialists; in addition, there was still no complete system of the postulates
of the theory of experience and chance free from unnecessary complications. The main result of this
work is the axiom of co~event, intended for the sake of constructing a theory formed by dual theories
of believabilities and probabilities, each of which itself is postulated by its own Kolmogorov
system of axioms. Here a preference is given to a system of postulates that is able to describe in a
simple manner the results of what I call an experienced-random experiment.
