More and more emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications involve status updates, where various
IoT devices monitor certain physical processes and report their latest statuses to the relevant
information fusion nodes. A new performance measure, termed the age of information (AoI), has recently
been proposed to quantify the information freshness in time-critical IoT applications. Due to
a large number of devices in future IoT networks, the decentralized channel access protocols (e.g.
random access) are preferable thanks to their low network overhead. Built on the AoI concept, some
recent efforts have developed several AoI-oriented ALOHA-like random access protocols for boosting
the network-wide information freshness. However, all relevant works focused on theoretical designs
and analysis. The development and implementation of a working prototype to evaluate and further
improve these random access protocols in practice have been largely overlooked. Motivated as such,
we build a software-defined radio (SDR) prototype for testing and comparing the performance of
recently proposed AoI-oriented random access protocols. To this end, we implement a time-slotted
wireless system by devising a simple yet effective over-the-air time synchronization scheme,
in which beacons that serve as reference timing packets are broadcast by an access point from time
to time. For a complete working prototype, we also design the frame structures of various packets
exchanged within the system. Finally, we design a set of experiments, implement them on our prototype
and test the considered algorithms in an office environment.
