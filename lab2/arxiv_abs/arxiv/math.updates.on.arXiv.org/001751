This study proposes a deep generative adversarial architecture (GAA) for network-wide spatial-temporal
traffic state estimation. The GAA is able to combine traffic flow theory with neural networks and
thus improve the accuracy of traffic state estimation. It consists of two Long Short-Term Memory
Neural Networks (LSTM NNs) which capture correlation in time and space among traffic flow and traffic
density. One of the LSTM NNs, called a discriminative network, aims to maximize the probability
of assigning correct labels to both true traffic state matrices (i.e., traffic flow and traffic
density within a given spatial-temporal area) and the traffic state matrices generated from the
other neural network. The other LSTM NN, called a generative network, aims to generate traffic state
matrices which maximize the probability that the discriminative network assigns true labels to
them. The two LSTM NNs are trained simultaneously such that the trained generative network can generate
traffic matrices similar to those in the training data set. Given a traffic state matrix with missing
values, we use back-propagation on three defined loss functions to map the corrupted matrix to a
latent space. The mapping vector is then passed through the pre-trained generative network to estimate
the missing values of the corrupted matrix. The proposed GAA is compared with the existing Bayesian
network approach on loop detector data collected from Seattle, Washington and that collected from
San Diego, California. Experimental results indicate that the GAA can achieve higher accuracy
in traffic state estimation than the Bayesian network approach.
