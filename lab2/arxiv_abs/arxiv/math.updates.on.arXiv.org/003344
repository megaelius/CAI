Lack of accurate intuition is often cited as a scientific challenge, especially when interpreting
probabilistic and statistical research. A popular technique for developing statistical intuition
involves imagining a game of chance with well-defined financial outcomes. In 1956 Kelly used this
technique to propose an intuitive interpretation of relative entropy [1]. He considered a growth-optimizing
investor in a game with mutually exclusive outcomes (a "horse race") and showed that the rate of return
expected by such an investor is equal to the relative entropy which measures disagreement between
the investor's believed probabilities and the official odds. Effectively, Kelly showed that a
growth-optimizing investor would expect on average to convert 1 bit of additional information
into a 100% return on investment. Notwithstanding the mathematics, this interpretation has been
vigorously criticized by Samuelson as dangerous on the grounds that most people are not growth-optimizing
[2,3]. Here we show that a deeper connection between information and expected returns is in fact
true. Relative to the Kelly information benchmark, variation in people's risk aversion does indeed
cause a drop in expected returns. However, the amount of the drop is also information-driven: it
is proportional to the absolute difference between the relative entropy and its celebrated generalization
-- the R\'enyi divergence [4]. Given the widespread use of the R\'enyi divergence in science and
engineering, and because financial returns are much easier to imagine, we expect our intuition
to be useful in a broad range of fields. Financial intuition might also be useful in its own right as
an instrument for raising financial support and accelerating the adoption of sound scientific
developments.
