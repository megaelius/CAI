We effectively answer the geometric Shafarevich's problem on the squarefree odd hyperelliptic
curves of genus $g$ with a marked Weierstrass point over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{F}_q)
> 2g+1$. We show this via counting the quasi-admissible hyperelliptic fibrations (which includes
the semistable hyperelliptic fibrations) over $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ by the bounded
height of the hyperelliptic discriminant $\Delta_{g}$ with a positive real number $\mathcal{B}$
. The precise count $\mathcal{Z}_{g, \mathbb{F}_q(t)}(\mathcal{B})$, that is sharp asymptotic
to $\mathcal{O}\left( \mathcal{B}^{\frac{2g+3}{4g+2}} \right)$, is established by first determining
the class in the Grothendieck ring of $K$-stacks for the Hom stack $\mathrm{Hom}_n(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathcal{P}(\vec{\lambda}))$
parameterizing the degree $n$ rational curves on a weighted projective stack $\mathcal{P}(\lambda_0,
\dotsc, \lambda_N)$ defined over a basefield $K$ with $\mathrm{char}(K) \nmid \lambda_i$ for
every $i$ . As a consequence, if $\mathrm{char}(K)=0$ or $> 2g+1$, we acquire the motive $\left[\mathcal{L}_{g,
|\Delta_g|}\right]$ of the moduli stack of quasi-admissible hyperelliptic genus $g$ fibrations
over $\mathbb{P}^1_{K}$ with a discriminant degree $|\Delta_g|$ as a polynomial in $\mathbb{L}$
which renders the exact cardinality of the set of weighted $\mathbb{F}_q$-points. In the end, we
formulate an analogous heuristic on $\mathcal{Z}_{g, \mathbb{Q}}(\mathcal{B})$ for counting
the odd degree hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ with a marked rational Weierstrass point over $\mathbb{Q}$
having $ht(\Delta_{g}) \le \mathcal{B}$ through the global fields analogy.
