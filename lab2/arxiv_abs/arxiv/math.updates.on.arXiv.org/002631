This is the second part to our companion paper [13]. Herein, we generalize to two space dimensions
the C-method developed in [14,13] for adding localized, space-time smooth artificial viscosity
to nonlinear systems of conservation laws that propagate shock waves, rarefaction waves, and contact
discontinuities. For gas dynamics, the C-method couples the Euler equations to scalar reaction-diffusion
equations, which we call C-equations, whose solutions serve as space-time smooth artificial viscosity
indicators for shocks and contacts. We develop a high-order numerical algorithm for gas dynamics
in 2-D which can accurately simulate the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability with Kelvin-Helmholtz
(KH) roll-up of the contact discontinuity, as well as shock collision and bounce-back. Solutions
to our C-equations not only indicate the location of the shocks and contacts, but also track the geometry
of the evolving fronts. This allows us to implement both directionally isotropic and anisotropic
artificial viscosity schemes, the latter adding diffusion only in directions tangential to the
evolving front. We additionally produce a novel shock collision indicator function, which naturally
activates during shock collision, and then smoothly deactivates. Moreover, we implement a high-frequency
2-D wavelet-based noise detector together with an efficient and localized noise removal algorithm.
To test the methodology, we use a highly simplified WENO-based discretization scheme, devoid of
any approximate Riemann solvers. We provide numerical results for some classical 2-D test problems,
including the RT problem, the Noh problem, a circular explosion problem from the Liska and Wendroff
[9] review paper, and a shock-wall collision problem.
