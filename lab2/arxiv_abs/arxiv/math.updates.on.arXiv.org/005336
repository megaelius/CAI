This paper proposes a new method for determining similarity and anomalies between time series,
most practically effective in large collections of (likely related) time series, with a particular
focus on measuring distances between structural breaks within such a collection. We consolidate
and generalise a class of semi-metric distance measures, which we term MJ distances. Experiments
on simulated data demonstrate that our proposed family of distances uncover similarity within
collections of time series more effectively than measures such as the Hausdorff and Wasserstein
metrics. Although our class of distances do not necessarily satisfy the triangle inequality requirement
of a metric, we analyse the transitivity properties of respective distance matrices in various
contextual scenarios. There, we demonstrate a trade-off between robust performance in the presence
of outliers, and the triangle inequality property. We show in experiments using real data that the
contrived scenarios that severely violate the transitivity property rarely exhibit themselves
in real data; instead, our family of measures satisfies all the properties of a metric most of the
time. We illustrate three ways of analysing the distance and similarity matrices, via eigenvalue
analysis, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering. The results from our hierarchical
and spectral clustering experiments on simulated data demonstrate that the Hausdorff and Wasserstein
metrics may lead to erroneous inference as to which time series are most similar with respect to their
structural breaks, while our semi-metrics provide an improvement.
