Multi-leader multi-follower games are a class of hierarchical games in which a collection of leaders
compete in a Nash game constrained by the equilibrium conditions of another Nash game amongst the
followers. The resulting equilibrium problems are complicated by nonconvex agent problems and
therefore providing tractable conditions for existence of global or even local equilibria has
proved challenging. Consequently, much of the extant research on this topic is either model specific
or relies on weaker notions of equilibria. In the first part of the paper, we provide what is perhaps
the first general existence to such games. Our central idea is to relate the global minima of certain
optimization problems to equilibria of these games. We show that if the objectives of the leaders
admit a quasi-potential function, one can construct an optimization problem (a mathematical program
with equilibrium constraints (MPEC)) whose global minimum is an equilibrium of the game. In effect
existence of equilibria can be guaranteed by the solvability of an optimization problem, which
holds under mild conditions. We then consider a modified formulation in which every leader is cognizant
of the equilibrium constraints of all leaders, leading to a shared constraint game. This modification
allows for more general objectives functions and it is shown that when the leader objectives admit
a potential function, the global minima of an optimization problem where the potential function
is minimized over the shared constraint, are equilibria of the modified multi-leader multi-follower
game. Importantly, equilibria of this modified game contain the equilibria, if any, of the original
game. In both instances, local minima and B-stationary points of the associated optimization problem
are shown to be local Nash equilibria and Nash B-stationary points of the corresponding multi-leader
multi-follower game.
