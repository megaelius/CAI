In the present essay we attempt to reconstruct Newtonian mechanics under the guidance of logical
principles and of a constructive approach related to the genetic epistemology of J. Piaget and R.
Garc\'ia \citep{piag89}. Instead of addressing Newton's equations as a set of axioms, ultimately
given by the revelation of a prodigious mind, we search for the fundamental knowledge, beliefs and
provisional assumptions that can produce classical mechanics. We start by developing our main
tool: the No Arbitrariness Principle, that we present in a form that is apt for a mathematical theory
as classical mechanics. Subsequently, we introduce the presence of the observer, analysing then
the relation objective-subjective and seeking objectivity going across subjectivity. We take
special care of establishing the precedence among all contributions to mechanics, something that
can be better appreciated by considering the consequences of removing them: (a) the consequence
of renouncing logic and the laws of understanding is not being able to understand the world, (b) renouncing
the early elaborations of primary concepts such as time and space leads to a dissociation between
everyday life and physics, the latter becoming entirely pragmatic and justified \emph{a-posteriori}
(because it is convenient), (c) changing our temporary beliefs has no real cost other than effort.
Finally, we exemplify the present approach by reconsidering the constancy of the velocity of light.
It is shown that it is a result of Newtonian mechanics, rather than being in contradiction with it.
We also indicate the hidden assumption that leads to the (apparent) contradiction.
