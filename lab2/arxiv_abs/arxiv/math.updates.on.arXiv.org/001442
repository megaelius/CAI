We propose a bootstrap-based calibrated projection procedure to build confidence intervals for
single components and for smooth functions of a partially identified parameter vector in moment
(in)equality models. The method controls asymptotic coverage uniformly over a large class of data
generating processes. The extreme points of the calibrated projection confidence interval are
obtained by extremizing the value of the component (or function) of interest subject to a proper
relaxation of studentized sample analogs of the moment (in)equality conditions. The degree of
relaxation, or critical level, is calibrated so that the component (or function) of $\theta$, not
$\theta$ itself, is uniformly asymptotically covered with prespecified probability. This calibration
is based on repeatedly checking feasibility of linear programming problems, rendering it computationally
attractive. Nonetheless, the program defining an extreme point of the confidence interval is generally
nonlinear and potentially intricate. We provide an algorithm, based on the response surface method
for global optimization, that approximates the solution rapidly and accurately. The algorithm
is of independent interest for inference on optimal values of stochastic nonlinear programs. We
establish its convergence under conditions satisfied by canonical examples in the moment (in)equalities
literature. Our assumptions and those used in the leading alternative approach (a profiling based
method) are not nested. An extensive Monte Carlo analysis confirms the accuracy of the solution
algorithm and the good statistical as well as computational performance of calibrated projection,
including in comparison to other methods.
