We study communication over multiple access channels (MAC) where one of the users is possibly adversarial.
When all users are non-adversarial, we want their messages to be decoded reliably. When an adversary
is present, we consider two different decoding guarantees. In part I, we require that the honest
users' messages be decoded reliably. We study the 3-user MAC; 2-user MAC capacity follows from point-to-point
AVC capacity. We characterize the capacity region for randomized codes. We also study the capacity
region for deterministic codes. We obtain necessary conditions including a new non-symmetrizability
condition for the capacity region to be non-trivial. We show that when none of the users are symmetrizable,
the randomized coding capacity region is also achievable with deterministic codes. In part II,
we consider the weaker goal of authenticated communication where we only require that an adversarial
user must not be able to cause an undetected error on the honest users' messages. For the 2-user MAC,
we show that the following 3-phase scheme is rate-optimal: a standard MAC code is first used to achieve
unauthenticated communication followed by two authentication phases where each user authenticates
their message treating the other user as a possible adversary. We show that the authentication phases
can be very short since this form of authentication itself, when possible, can be achieved for message
sets whose size grow doubly exponentially in blocklength. This leads to our result that the authenticated
communication capacity region of a discrete memoryless MAC is either zero or the (unauthenticated)
MAC capacity region itself. This also, arguably, explains the similar nature of authenticated
communication capacity of a discrete memoryless point-to-point adversarial channel recently
found by Kosut and Kliewer (ITW, 2018).
