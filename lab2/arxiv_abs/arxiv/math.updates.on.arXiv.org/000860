A crucial task in system identification problems is the selection of the most appropriate model
class, and is classically addressed resorting to cross-validation or using asymptotic arguments.
As recently suggested in the literature, this can be addressed in a Bayesian framework, where model
complexity is regulated by few hyperparameters, which can be estimated via marginal likelihood
maximization. It is thus of primary importance to design effective optimization methods to solve
the corresponding optimization problem. If the unknown impulse response is modeled as a Gaussian
process with a suitable kernel, the maximization of the marginal likelihood leads to a challenging
nonconvex optimization problem, which requires a stable and effective solution strategy. In this
paper we address this problem by means of a scaled gradient projection algorithm, in which the scaling
matrix and the steplength parameter play a crucial role to provide a meaning solution in a computational
time comparable with second order methods. In particular, we propose both a generalization of the
split gradient approach to design the scaling matrix in the presence of box constraints, and an effective
implementation of the gradient and objective function. The extensive numerical experiments carried
out on several test problems show that our method is very effective in providing in few tenths of a
second solutions of the problems with accuracy comparable with state-of-the-art approaches.
Moreover, the flexibility of the proposed strategy makes it easily adaptable to a wider range of
problems arising in different areas of machine learning, signal processing and system identification.
