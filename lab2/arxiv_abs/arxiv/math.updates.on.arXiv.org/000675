This paper introduces a new and ubiquitous framework for establishing achievability results in
\emph{network information theory} (NIT) problems. The framework uses random binning arguments
and is based on a duality between channel and source coding problems. {Further,} the framework uses
pmf approximation arguments instead of counting and typicality. This allows for proving coordination
and \emph{strong} secrecy problems where certain statistical conditions on the distribution
of random variables need to be satisfied. These statistical conditions include independence between
messages and eavesdropper's observations in secrecy problems and closeness to a certain distribution
(usually, i.i.d. distribution) in coordination problems. One important feature of the framework
is to enable one {to} add an eavesdropper and obtain a result on the secrecy rates "for free." We make
a case for generality of the framework by studying examples in the variety of settings containing
channel coding, lossy source coding, joint source-channel coding, coordination, strong secrecy,
feedback and relaying. In particular, by investigating the framework for the lossy source coding
problem over broadcast channel, it is shown that the new framework provides a simple alternative
scheme to \emph{hybrid} coding scheme. Also, new results on secrecy rate region (under strong secrecy
criterion) of wiretap broadcast channel and wiretap relay channel are derived. In a set of accompanied
papers, we have shown the usefulness of the framework to establish achievability results for coordination
problems including interactive channel simulation, coordination via relay and channel simulation
via another channel.
