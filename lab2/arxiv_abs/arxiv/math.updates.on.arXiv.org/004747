Cartan-Thullen theorem is a basic one in the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables.
It states that for any open set $U$ of ${\mathbb C}^k$, the following conditions are equivalent:
(a) $U$ is a domain of existence, (b) $U$ is a domain of holomorphy and (c) $U$ is holomorphically convex.
On the other hand, when $f \, (\, =(f_1,f_2,\cdots,f_n)\, )$ is a $\mathbb C^n$-valued function
on an open set $U$ of $\mathbb C^{k_1}\times\mathbb C^{k_2}\times\cdots\times\mathbb C^{k_n}$,
$f$ is said to be $\mathbb C^n$-analytic, if $f$ is complex analytic and for any $i$ and $j$, $i\not=j$
implies $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial z_j}=0$. Here, $(z_1,z_2,\cdots,z_n) \in \mathbb C^{k_1}\times\mathbb
C^{k_2}\times\cdots\times\mathbb C^{k_n}$ holds. We note that a $\mathbb C^n$-analytic mapping
and a $\mathbb C^n$-analytic manifold can be easily defined. In this paper, we show an analogue of
Cartan-Thullen theorem for a $\mathbb C^n$-analytic function. For $n=1$, it gives Cartan-Thullen
theorem itself. Our proof is almost the same as Cartan-Thullen theorem. Thus, our generalization
seems to be natural. On the other hand, our result is partial, because we do not answer the following
question. That is, does a connected open $\mathbb C^n$-holomorphically convex set $U$ exist such
that $U$ is not the direct product of any holomorphically convex sets $U_1, U_2, \cdots, U_{n-1}$
and $U_n$ ? As a corollary of our generalization, we give the following partial result. If $U$ is convex,
then $U$ is the direct product of some holomorphically convex sets. Also, $f$ is said to be $\mathbb
C^n$-triangular, if $f$ is complex analytic and for any $i$ and $j$, $i<j$ implies $\frac{\partial
f_i}{\partial z_j}=0$. Kasuya suggested that a $\mathbb C^n$-analytic manifold and a $\mathbb
C^n$-triangular manifold might, for example, be related to a holomorphic web and a holomorphic
foliation.
