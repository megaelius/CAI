Consider a random simplex $[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ defined as the convex hull of independent identically
distributed random points $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ with the following beta density:
$$ f_{n-1,\beta} (x) \propto (1-\|x\|^2)^{\beta} 1_{\{\|x\| < 1\}}, \qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n-1},
\quad \beta>-1. $$ Let $J_{n,k}(\beta)$ be the expected internal angle of the simplex $[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$
at its face $[X_1,\ldots,X_k]$. Define $\tilde J_{n,k}(\beta)$ analogously for i.i.d. random
points distributed according to the beta' density $$ \tilde f_{n-1,\beta} (x) \propto (1+\|x\|^2)^{-\beta},
\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n-1}, \quad \beta > \frac{n-1}{2}. $$ We derive formulae for $J_{n,k}(\beta)$
and $\tilde J_{n,k}(\beta)$ which make it possible to compute these quantities symbolically,
in finitely many steps, for any integer or half-integer value of $\beta$. For $J_{n,1}(\pm 1/2)$
we even provide explicit formulae in terms of products of Gamma functions. We give applications
of these results to two seemingly unrelated problems of stochastic geometry. (i) We compute the
expected $f$-vectors of the typical Poisson-Voronoi cells in dimensions up to $10$. (ii) Consider
the random polytope $K_{n,d} := [U_1,\ldots,U_n]$ where $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ are i.i.d. random points
sampled uniformly inside some $d$-dimensional convex body $K$ with smooth boundary and unit volume.
M. Reitzner proved the existence of the limit of the normalized expected $f$-vector of $K_{n,d}$:
$$ \lim_{n\to\infty} n^{-{\frac{d-1}{d+1}}}\mathbb E \mathbf f(K_{n,d}) = \mathbf c_d \cdot
\Omega(K), $$ where $\Omega(K)$ is the affine surface area of $K$, and $\mathbf c_d$ is an unknown
vector not depending on $K$. We compute $\mathbf c_d$ explicitly in dimensions up to $d=10$ and also
solve the analogous problem for random polytopes with vertices distributed uniformly on the sphere.
