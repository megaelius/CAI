Entropy principles based on thermodynamic consistency requirements are widely used for constitutive
modeling in continuum mechanics, providing physical constraints on a priori unknown constitutive
functions. The well-known M\"uller-Liu procedure is based on Liu's lemma for linear systems. While
the M\"uller-Liu algorithm works well for basic models with simple constitutive dependencies,
it cannot take into account nonlinear relationships that exist between higher derivatives of the
fields in the cases of more complex constitutive dependencies. The current contribution presents
a general solution set-based procedure, which, for a model system of differential equations, respects
the geometry of the solution manifold, and yields a set of constraint equations on the unknown constitutive
functions, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for the entropy production to stay nonnegative
for any solution. Similarly to the M\"uller-Liu procedure, the solution set approach is algorithmic,
its output being a set of constraint equations and a residual entropy inequality. The solution set
method is applicable to virtually any physical model, allows for arbitrary initially postulated
forms of the constitutive dependencies, and does not use artificial constructs like Lagrange multipliers.
A Maple implementation makes the solution set method computationally straightforward and useful
for the constitutive modeling of complex systems. Several computational examples are considered,
in particular, models of gas, anisotropic fluid, and granular flow dynamics. The resulting constitutive
function forms are analyzed, and comparisons are provided. It is shown how the solution set entropy
principle can yield classification problems, leading to several complementary sets of admissible
constitutive functions; such problems have not previously appeared in the constitutive modeling
literature.
