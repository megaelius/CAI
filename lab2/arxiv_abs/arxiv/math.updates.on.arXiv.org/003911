In this paper we propose and analyze a (temporally) third order accurate exponential time differencing
(ETD) numerical scheme for the no-slope-selection (NSS) equation of the epitaxial thin film growth
model, with Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space. A linear splitting is applied to
the physical model, and an ETD-based multistep approximation is used for time integration of the
corresponding equation. In addition, a third order accurate Douglas-Dupont regularization term,
in the form of $-A \dt^2 \phi_0 (L_N) \Delta_N^2 ( u^{n+1} - u^n)$, is added in the numerical scheme.
A careful Fourier eigenvalue analysis results in the energy stability in a modified version, and
a theoretical justification of the coefficient $A$ becomes available. As a result of this energy
stability analysis, a uniform in time bound of the numerical energy is obtained. And also, the optimal
rate convergence analysis and error estimate are derived in details, in the $\ell^\infty (0,T;
H_h^1) \cap \ell^2 (0,T; H_h^3)$ norm, with the help of a careful eigenvalue bound estimate, combined
with the nonlinear analysis for the NSS model. This convergence estimate is the first such result
for a third order accurate scheme for a gradient flow. Some numerical simulation results are presented
to demonstrate the efficiency of the numerical scheme and the third order convergence. The long
time simulation results for $\varepsilon=0.02$ (up to $T=3 \times 10^5$) have indicated a logarithm
law for the energy decay, as well as the power laws for growth of the surface roughness and the mound
width. In particular, the power index for the surface roughness and the mound width growth, created
by the third order numerical scheme, is more accurate than those produced by certain second order
energy stable schemes in the existing literature.
