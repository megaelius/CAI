We introduce a new method, which we call stochastic fusion, which takes an exclusion process and
constructs an interacting particle systems in which more than one particle may occupy a lattice
site. The construction only requires the existence of stationary measures of the original exclusion
process on a finite lattice. If the original exclusion process satisfies Markov duality on a finite
lattice, then the construction produces Markov duality functions (for some initial conditions)
for the fused exclusion process. The stochastic fusion construction is based off of the Rogers-Pitman
intertwining. In particular, we have results for three types of models: 1. For symmetric exclusion
processes, the fused process and duality functions are inhomogeneous generalizations of those
in \cite{GKRV}. The construction also allows a general class of open boundary conditions: as an
application of the duality, we find the hydrodynamic limit and stationary measures of the generalized
symmetric simple exclusion process SSEP$(m/2)$ on $\mathbb{Z}_+$ for open boundary conditions.
2. For the asymmetric simple exclusion process, the fused process and duality functions are inhomogeneous
generalizations of those found in \cite{CGRS} for the ASEP$(q,j)$. As a by-product of the construction,
we show that the multi-species ASEP$(q,j)$ preserves $q$-exchangeable measures, and use this
to find new duality functions for the ASEP, ASEP$(q,j)$ and $q$-Boson. Additionally, the construction
leads to duality for ASEP with open boundary conditions. 3. For dynamic models, we fuse the dynamic
ASEP from \cite{BorodinDyn}, and produce a dynamic and inhomogeneous version of ASEP$(q,j)$.
We also apply stochastic fusion to IRF models and compare them to previously found models. We include
an appendix co-authored with Amol Aggarwal.
