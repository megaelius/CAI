We are interested in mesh-free formulas based on the Monte-Carlo methodology for the approximation
of multi-dimensional integrals, and we investigate their accuracy when the functions belong to
a reproducing-kernel space. A kernel typically captures regularity and qualitative properties
of functions "beyond" the standard Sobolev regularity class. We are interested in the issue whether
quantitative error bounds can be a priori guaranteed in applications (e.g.~scientific computing,
mathematical finance, machine learning). Our main contribution is a numerical study of the error
discrepancy function when one varies the choice of the kernel, the number of approximation points,
and the dimension of the problem. We consider here wo strategies in order to localize to a bounded
set the standard kernels defined in the whole Euclidian space (exponential, multiquadric, Gaussian,
truncated), namely, on one hand the class of periodic kernels defined via a discrete Fourier transform
on a lattice, and on the other hand the class of transported kernels with compact support. First of
all, based on heuristic arguments and using on a Poisson formula on a lattice, we derive theoretical
bounds satisfied by the discrepancy function for periodic kernels. Second, for each kernel of exponential,
multiquadric, Gaussian, truncated type, we perform the extensive numerical experiments required
in order to generate the optimal distributions of points and the discrepancy functions. Our numerical
results provide us with quantitative estimates of the error made with kernel-based strategy vs.
a purely random strategy, and also validate our theoretical analysis.
