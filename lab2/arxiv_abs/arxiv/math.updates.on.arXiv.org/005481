In this paper, the inherent gradient flow structures of thermo-poro-visco-elastic processes
in porous media are examined for the first time. In the first part, a modelling framework is introduced
aiming for describing such processes as generalized gradient flows requiring choices of physical
states, corresponding energies, dissipation potentials and external work rates. It is demonstrated
that various existing models can be in fact written within this framework. Ultimately, the particular
structure allows for a unified well-posedness analysis performed for different classes of linear
and non-linear models. In the second part, the gradient flow structures are utilized for constructing
efficient discrete approximation schemes for thermo-poro-visco-elasticity -- in particular
robust, physical splitting schemes. Applying alternating minimization to naturally arising
minimization formulations of (semi-)discrete models is proposed. For such, the energy decrease
per iteration is quantified by applying abstract convergence theory only utilizing convexity
and Lipschitz continuity properties of the problem -- a fairly simple but flexible machinery. By
this approach, e.g., the widely used undrained and fixed-stress splits for the linear Biot equations
are derived and analyzed. By application of the framework to more advanced models, novel splitting
schemes with guaranteed theoretical convergence rates are naturally derived. Moreover, based
on the minimization character of the (semi-)discrete equations, relaxation of splitting schemes
by line search is proposed; numerical results show a potentially great impact on the acceleration
of splitting schemes for both linear and nonlinear problems.
