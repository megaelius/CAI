This paper proves the existence of small-amplitude global-in-time unique mild solutions to both
the Landau equation including the Coulomb potential and the Boltzmann equation without angular
cutoff. Since the well-known works (Guo, 2002) and (Gressman-Strain-2011, AMUXY-2012) on the
construction of classical solutions in smooth Sobolev spaces which in particular are regular in
the spatial variables, it still remains an open problem to obtain global solutions in an $L^\infty_{x,v}$
framework, similar to that in (Guo-2010), for the Boltzmann equation with cutoff in general bounded
domains. One main difficulty arises from the interaction between the transport operator and the
velocity-diffusion-type collision operator in the non-cutoff Boltzmann and Landau equations;
another major difficulty is the potential formation of singularities for solutions to the boundary
value problem. In the present work we introduce a new function space with low regularity in the spatial
variable to treat the problem in cases when the spatial domain is either a torus, or a finite channel
with boundary. For the latter case, either the inflow boundary condition or the specular reflection
boundary condition is considered. An important property of the function space is that the $L^\infty_T
L^2_v$ norm, in velocity and time, of the distribution function is in the Wiener algebra $A(\Omega)$
in the spatial variables. Besides the construction of global solutions in these function spaces,
we additionally study the large-time behavior of solutions for both hard and soft potentials, and
we further justify the property of propagation of regularity of solutions in the spatial variables.
