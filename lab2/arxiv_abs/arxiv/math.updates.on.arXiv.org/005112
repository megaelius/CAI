In recent work (Soltani, Kilmer, Hansen, BIT 2016), an algorithm for non-negative tensor patch
dictionary learning in the context of X-ray CT imaging and based on a tensor-tensor product called
the $t$-product (Kilmer and Martin, 2011) was presented. Building on that work, in this paper, we
use of non-negative tensor patch-based dictionaries trained on other data, such as facial image
data, for the purposes of either compression or image deblurring. We begin with an analysis in which
we address issues such as suitability of the tensor-based approach relative to a matrix-based approach,
dictionary size and patch size to balance computational efficiency and qualitative representations.
Next, we develop an algorithm that is capable of recovering non-negative tensor coefficients given
a non-negative tensor dictionary. The algorithm is based on a variant of the Modified Residual Norm
Steepest Descent method. We show how to augment the algorithm to enforce sparsity in the tensor coefficients,
and note that the approach has broader applicability since it can be applied to the matrix case as
well. We illustrate the surprising result that dictionaries trained on image data from one class
can be successfully used to represent and compress image data from different classes and across
different resolutions. Finally, we address the use of non-negative tensor dictionaries in image
deblurring. We show that tensor treatment of the deblurring problem coupled with non-negative
tensor patch dictionaries can give superior restorations as compared to standard treatment of
the non-negativity constrained deblurring problem.
