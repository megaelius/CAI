Finite element methods (FEM) are widely used for bounded heterogeneous media models, and boundary
element methods (BEM) are efficient for simulating wave propagation in unbounded homogeneous
media. A natural medium for wave propagation comprises a coupled bounded heterogeneous region
and an unbounded homogeneous free space. Frequency-domain wave propagation models in the medium,
such as the variable coefficient Helmholtz equation, include a faraway decay radiation condition
(RC). The FEM wave propagation models are based on truncating the unbounded region and approximating
the RC. The BEM models do not take into account of the heterogeneity in the medium. It is desirable
to develop algorithms that incorporate the full physics of the heterogenous and unbounded medium
wave propagation model, and avoid approximation of the RC. In this work we first present and analyze
an overlapping decomposition framework that is equivalent to a two- or three-dimensional full
space continuous model, governed by the Helmholtz equation with a spatially dependent refractive
index and the Sommerfeld RC (SRC). Consequently we develop a novel overlapping FEM-BEM algorithm
to simulate the equivalent coupled heterogeneous and unbounded medium system, modeling acoustic
or electromagnetic wave propagation in two dimensions. Our FEM-BEM framework incorporates the
SRC exactly and includes high-order FEM and BEM discretizations, respectively, in bounded and
unbounded regions. In the overlapping bounded domain, in which we compute both FEM and BEM solutions,
we impose appropriate constraints. Our numerical experiments demonstrate efficiency of the FEM-BEM
framework, for models with heterogeneous media comprising smooth and complex non-smooth regions.
