In this paper we investigate the extent to which the Lov\'asz Local Lemma (an important tool in probabilistic
combinatorics) can be adapted for the measurable setting. In most applications, the Lov\'asz Local
Lemma is used to produce a function $f \colon X \to Y$ with certain properties, where $X$ is some underlying
combinatorial structure and $Y$ is a (typically finite) set. Can this function $f$ be chosen to be
Borel or $\mu$-measurable for some probability Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ (assuming that $X$ is
a standard Borel space)? In the positive direction, we prove that if the set of constraints put on
$f$ is, in a certain sense, "locally finite," then there is always a Borel choice for $f$ that is "$\varepsilon$-close"
to satisfying these constraints, for any $\varepsilon > 0$. Moreover, if the combinatorial structure
on $X$ is "induced" by the $[0;1]$-shift action of a countable group $\Gamma$, then, even without
any local finiteness assumptions, there is a Borel choice for $f$ which satisfies the constraints
on an invariant conull set (i.e., with $\varepsilon = 0$). A direct corollary of our results is an
upper bound on the measurable chromatic number of the graph $G_n$ generated by the shift action of
the free group $\mathbb{F}_n$ that is asymptotically tight up to a factor of at most $2$ (which answers
a question of Lyons and Nazarov). On the other hand, our result for structures induced by measure-preserving
group actions is, at least for amenable groups, sharp in the following sense: a probability measure-preserving
action of a countably infinite amenable group satisfies the measurable version of the Lov\'asz
Local Lemma if and only if it admits a factor map to the $[0;1]$-shift action. To prove this, we combine
the tools of the Ornstein--Weiss theory of entropy for actions of amenable groups with concepts
from computability theory, specifically, Kolmogorov complexity.
