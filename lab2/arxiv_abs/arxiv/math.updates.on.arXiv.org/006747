Given a (finite or infinite) subset $X$ of the free monoid $A^*$ over a finite alphabet $A$, the rank
of $X$ is the minimal cardinality of a set $F$ such that $X \subseteq F^*$. We say that a submonoid $M$
generated by $k$ elements of $A^*$ is {\em $k$-maximal} if there does not exist another submonoid
generated by at most $k$ words containing $M$. We call a set $X \subseteq A^*$ {\em primitive} if it
is the basis of a $|X|$-maximal submonoid. This definition encompasses the notion of primitive
word -- in fact, $\{w\}$ is a primitive set if and only if $w$ is a primitive word. By definition, for
any set $X$, there exists a primitive set $Y$ such that $X \subseteq Y^*$. We therefore call $Y$ a {\em
primitive root} of $X$. As a main result, we prove that if a set has rank $2$, then it has a unique primitive
root. To obtain this result, we prove that the intersection of two $2$-maximal submonoids is either
the empty word or a submonoid generated by one single primitive word. For a single word $w$, we say
that the set $\{x,y\}$ is a {\em bi-root} of $w$ if $w$ can be written as a concatenation of copies of
$x$ and $y$ and $\{x,y\}$ is a primitive set. We prove that every primitive word $w$ has at most one
bi-root $\{x,y\}$ such that $|x|+|y|<\sqrt{|w|}$. That is, the bi-root of a word is unique provided
the word is sufficiently long with respect to the size (sum of lengths) of the root. Our results are
also compared to previous approaches that investigate pseudo-repetitions, where a morphic involutive
function $\theta$ is defined on $A^*$. In this setting, the notions of $\theta$-power, $\theta$-primitive
and $\theta$-root are defined, and it is shown that any word has a unique $\theta$-primitive root.
This result can be obtained with our approach by showing that a word $w$ is $\theta$-primitive if
and only if $\{w, \theta(w)\}$ is a primitive set.
