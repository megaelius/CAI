Strictly positive logics recently attracted attention both in the description logic and in the
provability logic communities for their combination of efficiency and sufficient expressivity.
The language of Reflection Calculus RC consists of implications between formulas built up from
propositional variables and constant `true' using only conjunction and diamond modalities which
are interpreted in Peano arithmetic as restricted uniform reflection principles. We extend the
language of RC by another series of modalities representing the operators associating with a given
arithmetical theory T its fragment axiomatized by all theorems of T of arithmetical complexity
$\Pi^0_n$, for all n>0. We note that such operators, in a precise sense, cannot be represented in
the full language of modal logic. We formulate a formal system RC$^\nabla$ extending RC that is sound
and, as we conjecture, complete under this interpretation. We show that in this system one is able
to express iterations of reflection principles up to any ordinal $<\epsilon_0$. On the other hand,
we provide normal forms for its variable-free fragment. Thereby, the variable-free fragment is
shown to be decidable and complete w.r.t. its natural arithmetical semantics. Whereas the normal
forms for the variable-free formulas of RC correspond in a unique way to ordinals below $\epsilon_0$,
the normal forms of RC$^\nabla$ are more general. It turns out that they are related in a canonical
way to the collections of proof-theoretic ordinals of (bounded) arithmetical theories for each
complexity level $\Pi^0_{n+1}$. Finally, we present an algebraic universal model for the variable-free
fragment of RC$^\nabla$ based on Ignatiev's Kripke frame. Our main theorem states the isomorphism
of several natural representations of this algebra.
