We introduce the extended Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits magic square based on the six composition
algebras: reals $\mathbb{R}$, complexes $\mathbb{C}$, ternions $\mathbb{T}$, quaternions
$\mathbb{H}$, sextonions $\mathbb{S}$ and octonions $\mathbb{O}$. The ternionic and sextonionic
rows/columns of the magic square yield non-reductive Lie algebras, including $\mathfrak{e}_{7\scriptscriptstyle{\frac{1}{2}}}$.
It is demonstrated that the algebras of the extended magic square appear quite naturally as the symmetries
of supergravity Lagrangians. The sextonionic row (for appropriate choices of real forms) gives
the non-compact global symmetries of the Lagrangian for $D=3$ maximal $\mathcal{N}=16$, magic
$\mathcal{N}=4$ and magic non-supersymmetric theories, obtained by dimensionally reducing
the $D=4$ parent theories on a circle, with the graviphoton left undualised. In particular, the
extremal intermediate non-reductive Lie algebra $\tilde{\mathfrak{e}}_{7(7)\scriptscriptstyle{\frac{1}{2}}}$
(which is not a subalgebra of $\mathfrak{e}_{8(8)}$) is the non-compact global symmetry algebra
of $D=3$, $\mathcal{N}=16$ supergravity as obtained by dimensionally reducing $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=8$
supergravity with $\mathfrak{e}_{7(7)}$ symmetry on a circle. The ternionic row (for appropriate
choices of real forms) gives the non-compact global symmetries of the Lagrangian for $D=4$ maximal
$\mathcal{N}=8$ and magic $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities obtained by dimensionally reducing
the parent $D=5$ maximal $\mathcal{N}=8$ and magic $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories on a circle. In particular,
the Kantor-Koecher-Tits intermediate non-reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{e}_{6(6)\scriptscriptstyle{\frac{1}{4}}}$
is the non-compact global symmetry algebra of $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity as obtained
by dimensionally reducing $D=5$, $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity with $\mathfrak{e}_{6(6)}$
symmetry on a circle.
