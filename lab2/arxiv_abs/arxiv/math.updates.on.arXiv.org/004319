Ageing's sensitivity to natural selection has long been discussed because of its apparent negative
effect on individual's fitness. Thanks to the recently described (Smurf) 2-phase model of ageing
we were allowed to propose a fresh angle for modeling the evolution of ageing. Indeed, by coupling
a dramatic loss of fertility with a high-risk of impending death - amongst other multiple so-called
hallmarks of ageing - the Smurf phenotype allowed us to consider ageing as a couple of sharp transitions.
The birth-death model (later called bd-model) we describe here is a simple life-history trait model
where each asexual and haploid individual is described by its fertility period $x_b$ and survival
period $x_d$. We show that, thanks to the Lansing effect, $x_b$ and $x_d$ converge during evolution
to configurations $x_b-x_d\approx 0$. This guarantees that a certain proportion of the population
maintains the Lansing effect which in turn, confers higher evolvability to individuals. \\To do
so, we built an individual-based stochastic model which describes the age and trait distribution
dynamics of such a finite population. Then we rigorously derive the adaptive dynamics models, which
describe the trait dynamics at the evolutionary time-scale. We extend the Trait Substitution Sequence
with age structure to take into account the Lansing effect. Finally, we study the limiting behaviour
of this jump process when mutations are small. We show that the limiting behaviour is described by
a differential inclusion whose solutions $x(t)=(x_b(t),x_d(t))$ reach the diagonal $\lbrace
x_b=x_d\rbrace$ in finite time and then remain on it. This differential inclusion is a natural way
to extend the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics in order to take into account the lack of regularity
of the invasion fitness function on the diagonal $\lbrace x_b=x_d\rbrace$.
