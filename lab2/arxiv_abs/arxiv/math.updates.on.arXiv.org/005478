Estimating the number of signals embedded in noise is a fundamental problem in signal processing.
As a classic estimator based on random matrix theory (RMT), the RMT estimator estimates the number
of signals via sequentially testing the likelihood of an eigenvalue as arising from a signal or noise
for a given over-detection probability. However, it tends to under-estimate the number of signals
as weak signal eigenvalues may be immersed in the non-negligible bias term among eigenvalues for
finite sample size. In order to solve this problem, we propose an RMT estimator with adaptive decision
criterion (termed as RMT-ADC estimator) by adaptively incorporating the bias term into the decision
criterion of the RMT estimator. Firstly, we analyze the effect of this bias term among eigenvalues
on the estimation performance of the RMT estimator. Then, we derive both the decreased over-estimation
probability and the increased under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by the
bias term when assuming the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal, and also derive the
increased under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by the bias term when assuming
the eigenvalue being tested is arising from noise. Based on these results, the RMT-ADC estimator
can adaptively determine whether the noise variance should be estimated under the assumption that
the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from noise, and thus can adaptively select
its decision criterion. Moreover, the RMT-ADC estimator can adaptively determine whether the
bias term among eigenvalues should be incorporated into the selected decision criterion or not.
Therefore, the RMT-ADC estimator can avoid the higher under-estimation probability of the RMT
estimator. Finally, simulation results are presented to show that the proposed RMT-ADC estimator
significantly outperforms the existing estimators.
