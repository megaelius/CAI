We investigate an extension of an equilibrium-type result, conjectured by Ambrus, Ball and Erd\'elyi,
and proved recently by Hardin, Kendall and Saff. These results were formulated on the torus, hence
we also work on the torus, but one of the main motivations for our extension comes from an analogous
setup on the unit interval, investigated earlier by Fenton. Basically, the problem is a minimax
one, i.e. to minimize the maximum of a function $F$, defined as the sum of arbitrary translates of
certain fixed "kernel functions", minimization understood with respect to the translates. If
these kernels are assumed to be concave, having certain singularities or cusps at zero, then translates
by $y_j$ will have singularities at $y_j$ (while in between these nodes the sum function still behaves
realtively regularly). So one can consider the maxima $m_i$ on each subintervals between the nodes
$y_j$, and look for the minimization of $\max F = \max_i m_i$. Here also a dual question of maximization
of $\min_i m_i$ arises. This type of minimax problems were treated under some additional assumptions
on the kernels. Also the problem is normalized so that $y_0=0$. In particular, Hardin, Kendall and
Saff assumed that we have one single kernel $K$ on the torus or circle, and $F=\sum_{j=0}^n K(\cdot-y_j)=
K + \sum_{j=1}^n K(\cdot-y_j)$. Fenton considered situations on the interval with two fixed kernels
$J$ and $K$, also satisfying additional assumptions, and $F= J + \sum_{j=1}^n K(\cdot-y_j)$. Here
we consider the situation (on the circle) when \emph{all the kernel functions can be different},
and $F=\sum_{j=0}^n K_j(\cdot- y_j) = K_0 + \sum_{j=1}^n K_j(\cdot-y_j)$. Also an emphasis is
put on relaxing all other technical assumptions and give alternative, rather minimal variants
of the set of conditions on the kernel.
