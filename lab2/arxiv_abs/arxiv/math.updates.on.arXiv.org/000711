Traditionally, the capacity region of a coherent fading multiple access channel (MAC) is analyzed
in two popular contexts. In the first, a centralized system with full channel state information
at the transmitters (CSIT) is assumed, and the communication parameters like transmit power and
data-rate are jointly chosen for every fading vector realization. On the other hand, in fast-fading
links with distributed CSIT, the lack of full CSI is compensated by performing ergodic averaging
over sufficiently many channel realizations. Notice that the distributed CSI may necessitate
decentralized power-control for optimal data-transfer. Apart from these two models, the case
of slow-fading links and distributed CSIT, though relevant to many systems, has received much less
attention. In this paper, a block-fading AWGN MAC with full CSI at the receiver and distributed CSI
at the transmitters is considered. The links undergo independent fading, but otherwise have arbitrary
fading distributions. The channel statistics and respective long-term average transmit powers
are known to all parties. We first consider the case where each encoder has knowledge only of its own
link quality, and not of others. For this model, we compute the adaptive capacity region, i.e. the
collection of average rate-tuples under block-wise coding/decoding such that the rate-tuple
for every fading realization is inside the instantaneous MAC capacity region. The key step in our
solution is an optimal rate allocation function for any given set of distributed power control laws
at the transmitters. This also allows us to characterize the optimal power control for a wide class
of fading models. Further extensions are also proposed to account for more general CSI availability
at the transmitters.
