Random key graphs form a class of random intersection graphs and are naturally induced by the random
key predistribution scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor for securing wireless sensor network (WSN)
communications. Random key graphs have received much interest recently, owing in part to their
wide applicability in various domains including recommender systems, social networks, secure
sensor networks, clustering and classification analysis, and cryptanalysis to name a few. In this
paper, we study connectivity properties of random key graphs in the presence of unreliable links.
Unreliability of the edges are captured by independent Bernoulli random variables, rendering
edges of the graph to be on or off independently from each other. The resulting model is an intersection
of a random key graph and an Erdos-Renyi graph, and is expected to be useful in capturing various real-world
networks; e.g., with secure WSN applications in mind, link unreliability can be attributed to harsh
environmental conditions severely impairing transmissions. We present conditions on how to scale
this model's parameters so that i) the minimum node degree in the graph is at least k, and ii) the graph
is k-connected, both with high probability as the number of nodes becomes large. The results are
given in the form of zeroone laws with critical thresholds identified and shown to coincide for both
graph properties. These findings improve the previous results by Rybarczyk on the k-connectivity
of random key graphs (with reliable links), as well as the zero-one laws by Yagan on the 1-connectivity
of random key graphs with unreliable links.
