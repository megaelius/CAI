In recent years, it has been drawn a lot of attention to the question of whether logistic kinetics
is sufficient to enforce the global existence of classical solutions or to prevent finite-time
blow-up in various chemotaxis models. However, for several important chemotaxis models, only
in the space two dimensional setting, it has been shown that logistic kinetics is sufficient to enforce
the global existence of classical solutions (see [8] and [28]). The current paper is to give a confirmed
answer to the above question for the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular
sensitivity and logistic source in any space dimensional setting, \begin{equation} \begin{cases}
u_t=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v} \nabla v)+u(a(x,t)-b(x,t) u),\quad x\in \Omega\cr
0=\Delta v-\mu v+\nu u,\quad x\in \Omega \quad \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial
v}{\partial n}=0,\quad x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset
\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$, $\chi$ is the singular
chemotaxis sensitivity coefficient, $a(x,t)$ and $b(x,t)$ are positive smooth functions, and
$\mu,\nu$ are positive constants. We prove that, for any given nonnegative initial data $0\not\equiv
u_0\in C^0(\bar \Omega)$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution $(u(t,x;u_0),v(t,x;u_0))$
with $u(0,x;u_0)=u_0(x)$, which shows that, in any space dimensional setting, logistic kinetics
is sufficient to enforce the global existence of classical solutions and hence prevents the occurrence
of finite-time blow-up even for arbitrarily large $\chi$. In addition, the solutions are shown
to be uniformly bounded under the conditions $a_{\inf}>\frac{\mu \chi^2}{4}$ when $\chi \leq
2$ and $a_{\inf}>\mu (\chi-1)$ when $\chi>2$.
