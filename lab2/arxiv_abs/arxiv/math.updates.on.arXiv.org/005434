Let $G$ be a graph on the vertex set $V=\{v_{1},\dots,v_{n}\}$ with adjacency matrix $A.$ For a subset
$S$ of $V$ let ${\rm e}=(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n})^{\rm T}$ be the characteristic vector of $S,$
that is, $x_{\ell}=1$ if $v_{\ell}\in S$ and $x_{\ell}=0$ otherwise. Then the $walk\,\, matrix$
of $G$ for $S$ is $$W^{S}:=\big[{\rm e},\,A{\rm e},\,A^{2}{\rm e},\dots,A^{n-1}{\rm e}\big].$$
In this matrix the $k^{\rm th}$ entry in the row corresponding to $v_{\ell}$ is the number of walks
of length $k-1$ from $v_{\ell}$ to some vertex in $S.$ We investigate two related problems: To what
degree does a walk matrix determine the adjacency matrix of the graph, and how can walk matrices be
computed from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph? The answer to the first question depends
essentially on the rank of the walk matrix. For given walk matrix $W=W^{S}$ we define its $core$ $A_{W}.$
This matrix has ${\rm rank}(W)$ or ${\rm rank}(W)-1.$ We show that $A=A_{W}+N$ where $N$ is a symmetric
matrix with $N\cdot A_{W}=0.$ This theorem has several applications. For instance, we show that
if $W$ has rank $\geq n-1$ then the adjacency matrix can be computed from $W,$ and this result is best
possible in general. Similar conclusions are available in probabilistic models or if suitable
assumptions on the characteristic polynomial of the graph are made. We mention applications to
graph automorphism and isomorphism testing problems when some walk matrix has large rank. With
regard to the second question we show that $W$ is determined by a certain eigenvector matrix $E$ and
a matrix $M$ formed from certain eigenvalues of $A$ that are related to the set $S.$ These are known
as the $main\,\, eigenvectors$ and $main\,\, eigenvalues$ of $G$ for the given set. We show that
$W=E\cdot M.$ In the opposite direction we prove that $W$ determines $M$ and $E$ uniquely.
