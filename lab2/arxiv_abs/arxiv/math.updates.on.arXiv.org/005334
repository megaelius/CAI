Flatly Foliated Relativity (FFR) is a new theory which conceptually lies between Special Relativity
(SR) and General Relativity (GR), in which spacetime is foliated by flat Euclidean spaces. While
GR is based on the idea that "matter curves spacetime", FFR is based on the idea that "matter curves
spacetime, but not space". This idea, inspired by the observed spatial flatness of our local universe,
is realized by considering the same action as used in GR, but restricting it only to metrics which
are foliated by flat spatial slices. FFR can be thought of as describing gravity without gravitational
waves. In FFR, a positive cosmological constant implies several interesting properties which
do not follow in GR: the metric equations are elliptic on each euclidean slice, there exists a unique
vacuum solution among those spherically symmetric at infinity, and there exists a geometric way
to define the arrow of time. Furthermore, as gravitational waves do not exist in FFR, there are simple
analogs to the positive mass theorem and Penrose-type inequalities. Importantly, given that gravitational
waves have a negligible effect on the curvature of spacetime, and that the universe appears to be
locally flat, FFR may be a good approximation of GR. Moreover, FFR still admits many notable features
of GR including the big bang, an accelerating expansion of the universe, and the Schwarzschild spacetime.
Lastly, FFR is already known to have an existence theory for some simplified cases, which provokes
an interesting discussion regarding the possibility of a more general existence theory, which
may be relevant to understanding existence of solutions to GR.
