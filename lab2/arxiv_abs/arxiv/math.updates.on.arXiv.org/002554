We consider the chemotaxis-fluid system \begin{align}\label{star}\tag{$\diamondsuit$} \left\{
\begin{array}{r@{\,}c@{\,}c@{\ }l@{\quad}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c} n_{t}&+&u\cdot\!\nabla n&=\Delta
n^m-\nabla\!\cdot(n\nabla c),\ &x\in\Omega,& t>0,\\ c_{t}&+&u\cdot\!\nabla c&=\Delta c-c+n,\
&x\in\Omega,& t>0,\\ u_{t}&+&(u\cdot\nabla)u&=\Delta u+\nabla P+n\nabla\phi,\ &x\in\Omega,&
t>0,\\ &&\nabla\cdot u&=0,\ &x\in\Omega,& t>0, \end{array}\right. \end{align} in a bounded
domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ with smooth boundary and $m>1$. Assuming $m>\frac{4}{3}$
and sufficiently regular nonnegative initial data, we ensure the existence of global solutions
to the no-flux-Dirichlet boundary value problem for \eqref{star} under a suitable notion of very
weak solvability, which in different variations has been utilized in the literature before. Comparing
this with known results for the fluid-free setting of \eqref{star} the condition appears to be optimal
with respect to global existence. In case of the stronger assumption $m>\frac{5}{3}$ we moreover
establish the existence of at least one global weak solution in the standard sense. In our analysis
we investigate a functional of the form $\int_{\Omega}\! n^{m-1}+\int_{\Omega}\! c^2$ to obtain
a spatio-temporal $L^2$ estimate on $\nabla n^{m-1}$, which will be the starting point in deriving
a series of compactness properties for a suitably regularized version of \eqref{star}. As the regularity
information obtainable from these compactness results vary depending on the size of $m$, we will
find that taking $m>\frac{5}{3}$ will yield sufficient regularity to pass to the limit in the integrals
appearing in the weak formulation, while for $m>\frac{4}{3}$ we have to rely on milder regularity
requirements making only very weak solutions attainable.
