The type problem is the problem of deciding, for a simply connected Riemann surface, whether it is
conformally equivalent to the complex plane or to the unit dic in the complex plane. We report on Teichm{\"u}ller's
results on the type problem from his two papers Eine Anwendung quasikonformer Abbildungen auf das
Typenproblem (An application of quasiconformal map-pings to the type problem) (1937) and Untersuchungen{\"u}ber
kon-forme und quasikonforme Abbildungen (Investigations on con-formal and quasiconformal mappings)
(1938). They concern simply connected Riemann surfaces defined as branched covers of the sphere.
At the same time, we review the theory of line complexes, a combinatorial device used by Teichm{\"u}ller
and others to encode branched coverings of the sphere. In the first paper, Teichm{\"u}ller proves
that any two simply connected Riemann surfaces which are branched coverings of the Riemann sphere
with finitely many branch values and which have the same line complex are quasiconformally equivalent.
For this purpose, he introduces a technique for piecing together quasi-conformal mappings. He
also obtains a result on the extension of smooth orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the
circle to quasiconformal mappings of the disc which are conformal at the boundary. In the second
paper, using line complexes, Teichm{\"u}ller gives a type criterion for a simply-connected surface
which is a branched covering of the sphere, in terms of an adequately defined measure of ramification,
defined by a limiting process. The result says that if the surface is ''sufficiently ramified''
(in a sense to be made precise), then it is hyperbolic. In the same paper, Te-ichm{\"u}ller answers
by the negative a conjecture made by Nevan-linna which states a criterion for parabolicity in terms
of the value of a (different) measure of ramification, defined by a limiting process. Teichm{\"u}ller's
results in his first paper are used in the proof of the results of the second one.The final version
of this paper will appear in Vol. VII of the Handbook of Teichm{\"u}ller theory (European Mathematical
Society Publishing House, 2020).
