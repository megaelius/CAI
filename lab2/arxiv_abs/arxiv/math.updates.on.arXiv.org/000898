We study a class of linear network coding (LNC) schemes, called \emph{circular-shift} LNC, whose
encoding operations at intermediate nodes consist of only circular-shifts and bit-wise addition
(XOR). Departing from existing literature, we systematically formulate circular-shift LNC as
a special type of vector LNC, where the local encoding kernels of an $L$-dimensional circular-shift
linear code of degree $\delta$ are summation of at most $\delta$ cyclic-permutation matrices of
size $L$. Under this framework, an intrinsic connection between scalar LNC and circular-shift
LNC is established. In particular, on a general network, for some block lengths $L$, every scalar
linear solution over GF($2^{L-1}$) can induce an $(L-1, L)$-fractional circular-shift linear
solution of degree $(L-1)/2$. Specific to multicast networks, an $(L-1, L)$-fractional circular-shift
linear solution of arbitrary degree $\delta$ can be efficiently constructed. With different $\delta$,
the constructed solution has an interesting encoding-decoding complexity tradeoff, and when
$\delta = (L-1)/2$, it requires fewer binary operations for both encoding and decoding processes
compared with scalar LNC. While the constructed solution has one-bit redundancy per edge transmission,
we show that this is inevitable, and that circular-shift LNC is insufficient to achieve the exact
capacity of some multicast networks. Last, both theoretical and numerical analysis imply that
with increasing $L$, a randomly constructed circular-shift linear code has comparable linear
solvability behavior to a randomly constructed permutation-based linear code, but has much shorter
overheads for random coding.
