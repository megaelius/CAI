The cycle joining method and the cross-join pairing are two main construction techniques for de
Bruijn sequences. This work shows how to combine Zech's logarithms and each of the two techniques
to efficiently construct binary de Bruijn sequences of large orders. A basic implementation is
supplied as a proof-of-concept. In the cycle joining method, the cycles are generated by an LFSR
with a chosen period. We prove that determining Zech's logarithms is equivalent to identifying
conjugate pairs shared by any pair of cycles. The approach quickly finds enough number of conjugate
pairs between any two cycles to ensure the existence of trees containing all vertices in the adjacency
graph of the LFSR. When the characteristic polynomial of the LFSR is a product of distinct irreducible
polynomials, the approach via Zech's logarithms combines nicely with a recently proposed method
to determine the conjugate pairs. This allows us to efficiently generate de Bruijn sequences with
larger orders. Along the way, we establish new properties of Zech's logarithms. The characterization
of conjugate pairs via Zech's logarithms as positional markings is then adapted into identifying
cross-join pairs in a de Bruijn sequence. We start from any de Bruijn sequence, although typically
a modified $m$-sequence for ease of generation, and demonstrate how to use Zech's logarithms to
identify all cross-join pairs in that sequence. The process can be repeated on each of the resulting
sequences until a desired number of distinct sequences are produced. The computational process
can be made more efficient by using a new analytic tool attributed to Fryers as well as prior algorithmic
tools.
