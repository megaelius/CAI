Powerful interior-point methods (IPM) based commercial solvers, such as Gurobi and Mosek, have
been hugely successful in solving large-scale linear programming (LP) problems. The high efficiency
of these solvers depends critically on the sparsity of the problem data and advanced matrix factorization
techniques. For a large scale LP problem with data matrix $A$ that is dense (possibly structured)
or whose corresponding normal matrix $AA^T$ has a dense Cholesky factor (even with re-ordering),
these solvers may require excessive computational cost and/or extremely heavy memory usage in
each interior-point iteration. Unfortunately, the natural remedy, i.e., the use of iterative
methods based IPM solvers, although can avoid the explicit computation of the coefficient matrix
and its factorization, is not practically viable due to the inherent extreme ill-conditioning
of the large scale normal equation arising in each interior-point iteration. To provide a better
alternative choice for solving large scale LPs with dense data or requiring expensive factorization
of its normal equation, we propose a semismooth Newton based inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian
({\sc Snipal}) method. Different from classical IPMs, in each iteration of {\sc Snipal}, iterative
methods can efficiently be used to solve simpler yet better conditioned semismooth Newton linear
systems. Moreover, {\sc Snipal} not only enjoys a fast asymptotic superlinear convergence but
is also proven to enjoy a finite termination property. Numerical comparisons with Gurobi have demonstrated
encouraging potential of {\sc Snipal} for handling large-scale LP problems where the constraint
matrix $A$ has a dense representation or $AA^T$ has a dense factorization even with an appropriate
re-ordering.
