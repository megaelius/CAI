We study the sets that are computable from both halves of some (Martin-L\"of) random sequence, which
we call \emph{$1/2$-bases}. We show that the collection of such sets forms an ideal in the Turing
degrees that is generated by its c.e.\ elements. It is a proper subideal of the $K$-trivial sets.
We characterise $1/2$-bases as the sets computable from both halves of Chaitin's $\Omega$, and
as the sets that obey the cost function $\mathbf c(x,s) = \sqrt{\Omega_s - \Omega_x}$. Generalising
these results yields a dense hierarchy of subideals in the $K$-trivial degrees: For $k< n$, let $B_{k/n}$
be the collection of sets that are below any $k$ out of $n$ columns of some random sequence. As before,
this is an ideal generated by its c.e.\ elements and the random sequence in the definition can always
be taken to be $\Omega$. Furthermore, the corresponding cost function characterisation reveals
that $B_{k/n}$ is independent of the particular representation of the rational $k/n$, and that
$B_p$ is properly contained in $B_q$ for rational numbers $p< q$. These results are proved using
a generalisation of the Loomis--Whitney inequality, which bounds the measure of an open set in terms
of the measures of its projections. The generality allows us to analyse arbitrary families of orthogonal
projections. As it turns out, these do not give us new subideals of the $K$-trivial sets, we can calculate
from the family which $B_p$ it characterises. We finish by showing that the the union of $B_p$ for
$p<1$ is the collection of sets which are robustly computable from a random, a class previously studied
by Hirschfeldt, Jockusch, Kuyper, and Schupp.
