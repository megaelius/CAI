Our first result is a noncommutative form of Jessen/Marcinkiewicz/Zygmund theorem for the maximal
limit of multiparametric martingales or ergodic means. It implies bilateral almost uniform convergence
with initial data in the expected Orlicz spaces. A key ingredient is the introduction of the $L_p$-norm
of the $\limsup$ of a sequence of operators as a localized version of a $\ell_\infty/c_0$-valued
$L_p$-space. In particular, our main result gives a strong $L_1$-estimate for the $\limsup$, as
opposed to the usual weak $L_{1,\infty}$-estimate for the $\sup$. Let $\mathcal{L} \mathbf{F}_2$
denote the free group algebra and consider the free Poisson semigroup generated by the usual length
function. It is an open problem to determine the largest class inside $L_1(\mathcal{L} \mathbf{F}_2)$
for which this semigroup converges to the initial data. Currently, the best known result is $L \log^2
L(\mathcal{L} \mathbf{F}_2)$. We improve this by adding to it the operators in $L_1(\mathcal{L}
\mathbf{F}_2)$ spanned by words without signs changes. Contrary to other related results in the
literature, this set has exponential growth. The proof relies on our estimates for the noncommutative
$\limsup$ together with new transference techniques. We also establish a noncommutative form
of C\'ordoba/Feffermann/Guzm\'an inequality for the strong maximal. More precisely, a weak $(\Phi,\Phi)$
inequality for noncommutative multiparametric martingales and $\Phi(s) = s (1 + \log_+ s)^{2 +
\varepsilon}$. This logarithmic power is an $\varepsilon$-perturbation of the expected optimal
one. The proof combines a refinement of Cuculescu's construction with a quantum probabilistic
interpretation of de Guzm\'an's argument. The commutative form of our argument gives the simplest
known proof of this classical inequality. A few interesting consequences are derived for Cuculescu's
projections.
