We construct bundles $E_k(\A,\F) \to M$ over the complement $M$ of a complex hyperplane arrangement
\A, depending on an integer $k \geq 1$ and a set $\F=\{f_1, \ldots, f_\mu\}$ of continuous functions
$f_i \colon M \to \C$ whose differences are nonzero on $M$, generalizing the configuration space
bundles arising in the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation of the pure braid group. We display
such families \F\ for rank two arrangements, reflection arrangements of types $A_\ell$, $B_\ell$,
$D_\ell$, $F_4$, and for arrangements supporting multinet structures with three classes, with
the resulting bundles having nontrivial monodromy around each hyperplane. The construction extends
to arbitrary arrangements by pulling back these bundles along products of inclusions arising from
subarrangements of these types. We then consider the faithfulness of the resulting representations
of the arrangement group $\pi_1(M)$. We describe the kernel of the product $\rho_\X \colon G \to
\prod_{S \in \X} G_S$ of homomorphisms of a finitely-generated group $G$ onto quotient groups $G_S$
determined by a family \X\ of subsets of a fixed set of generators of $G$, extending a result of T.~Stanford
about Brunnian braids. When the projections $G \to G_S$ split in a compatible way, we show the image
of $\rho_\X$ is normal with free abelian quotient, and identify the cohomological finiteness type
of $G$. These results apply to some well-studied arrangements, implying several qualitative and
residual properties of $\pi_1(M)$, including an alternate proof of a result of Artal, Cogolludo,
and Matei on arrangement groups and Bestvina-Brady groups, and a dichotomy for a decomposable arrangement
\A: either $\pi_1(M)$ has a conjugation-free presentation or it is not residually nilpotent.
