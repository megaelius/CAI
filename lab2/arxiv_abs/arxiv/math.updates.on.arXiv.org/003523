Although there is no canonical version of the harmonic oscillator on the Heisenberg group $\mathbf{H}_n$
so far, we make a strong case for a particular choice of operator by using the representation theory
of the Dynin-Folland group $\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}$, a $3$-step stratified Lie group, whose generic
representations act on $L^2(\mathbf{H}_n)$. Our approach is inspired by the connection between
the harmonic oscillator on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the sum of squares in the first stratum of $\mathbf{H}_n$
in the sense that we define the harmonic oscillator on $\mathbf{H}_n$ as the image of the sub-Laplacian
$\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}}$ under the generic unitary irreducible representation $\pi$
of the Dynin-Folland group which has formal dimension $d_\pi = 1$. This approach, more generally,
permits us to define a large class of so-called anharmonic oscillators by employing positive Rockland
operators on $\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}$. By using the methods developed in ter Elst and Robinson [tERo],
we obtain spectral estimates for the harmonic and anharmonic oscillators on $\mathbf{H}_n$. Moreover,
we show that our approach extends to graded $SI/Z$-groups of central dimension $1$, i.e., graded
groups which possess unitary irreducible representations which are square-integrable modulo
the $1$-dimensional center $Z(G)$. The latter part of the article is concerned with spectral multipliers.
By combining ter Elst and Robinson's techniques with recent results in [AkRu18], we obtain useful
$L^\mathbf{p}$-$L^\mathbf{q}$-estimates for spectral multipliers of the sub-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{H}_{n,
2}}$ and, in fact more generally, of general Rockland operators on general graded groups. As a by-product,
we recover the Sobolev embeddings on graded groups established in [FiRu17], and obtain explicit
hypoelliptic heat semigroup estimates.
