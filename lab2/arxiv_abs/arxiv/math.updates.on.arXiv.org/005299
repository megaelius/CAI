The failure of distributivity in quantum logic is motivated by the principle of quantum superposition.
However, this principle can be encoded differently, i.e., in different logico-algebraic objects.
As a result, the logic of experimental quantum propositions might have various semantics. E.g.,
it might have either a total semantics, or a partial semantics (in which the valuation relation --
i.e., a mapping from the set of atomic propositions to the set of two objects, 1 and 0 -- is not total),
or a many-valued semantics (in which the gap between 1 and 0 is completed with truth degrees). Consequently,
closed linear subspaces of the Hilbert space representing experimental quantum propositions
may be organized differently. For instance, they could be organized in the structure of a Hilbert
lattice (or its generalizations) identified with the bivalent semantics of quantum logic or in
a structure identified with a non-bivalent semantics. On the other hand, one can only verify -- at
the same time -- propositions represented by the closed linear subspaces corresponding to mutually
commuting projection operators. This implies that to decide which semantics is proper -- bivalent
or non-bivalent -- is not possible experimentally. Nevertheless, the latter allows simplification
of certain no-go theorems in the foundation of quantum mechanics. In the present paper, the Kochen-Specker
theorem asserting the impossibility to interpret, within the orthodox quantum formalism, projection
operators as definite {0,1}-valued (pre-existent) properties, is taken as an example. The paper
demonstrates that within the algebraic structure identified with supervaluationism (the form
of a partial, non-bivalent semantics), the statement of this theorem gets deduced trivially.
