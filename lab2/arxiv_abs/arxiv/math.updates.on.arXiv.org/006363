Let $\mathbf{k}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and $\mathbf{K}$ a finitely
generated field over $\mathbf{k}$. Let $\Sigma$ be a central simple $\mathbf{K}$-algebra, $X$
a normal projective model of $\mathbf{K}$ and $\Lambda$ a sheaf of maximal $\mathcal{O}_X$-orders
in $\Sigma$. There is a ramification $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor $\Delta$ on $X$, which is related to
the canonical bimodule $\omega_\Lambda$ by an adjunction formula. It only depends on the class
of $\Sigma$ in the Brauer group of $\mathbf{K}$. When the numerical abundance conjecture holds
true, or when $\Sigma$ is a division algebra, we show that the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension (or GK
dimension) of the canonical ring of $\Lambda$ is one more than the Iitaka dimension (or D-dimension)
of the log pair $(X,\Delta)$. In the case that $\Sigma$ is a division algebra, we further show that
this GK dimension is also one more than the transcendence degree of the division algebra of degree
zero fractions of the canonical ring of $\Lambda$. We prove that these dimensions are birationally
invariant when the b-log pair determined by the ramification divisor has b-canonical singularities.
In that case we refer to the D-dimension of $(X,\Delta)$ as the Kodaira dimension of the order $\Lambda$.
For this, we establish birational invariance of the Kodaira dimension of b-log pairs with b-canonical
singularities. We also show that the Kodaira dimension can not decrease for an embedding of division
algebras, finite dimensional over their centres, which induces a Galois extension of their centres,
and satisfies a divisibility condition on the ramification which we call an effective embedding.
For example, this condition holds if the target division algebra has the property that its period
equals its index.
