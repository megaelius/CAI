Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field, $E$ be a quadratic extension of $F$, $D$ be an $F$-central division algebra
of odd index and let $\theta$ be the Galois involuton attached to $E/F$. Set $H=GL(m,D)$, $G=GL(m,D\otimes_F
E)$, let $P=MU$ be a standard parabolic subgroup of $G$ and $\mathfrak{Z_M}(\mathbb{C})$ denote
the complex points of the Lie algebra of the center of $M$. Following the global methods of Jacquet-Lapid-Rogawski,
if $w$ is a Weyl involution stabilizing $M$ and $M^{\theta_w}$ is the subgroup of $M$ fixed by $\theta_w:m\mapsto
\theta(wmw)$, we associate to a finite length representation $\sigma$ of $M$ and to a linear form
$L\in \mathrm{Hom}_{M^{\theta_w}}(\sigma,\mathbb{C})$ a meromorphic family of $H$-invariant
linear forms called intertwining periods on $\mathrm{Ind}_P^G(\sigma[\underline{s}])$ for
$\underline{s}$ a parameter in the $w$-anti-invariants of $\mathfrak{Z_M}(\mathbb{C})$ by
which we twist $\sigma$. Then we give sufficient conditions for some of these intertwining periods,
namely the open intertwining periods studied by Blanc and Delorme, to have singularities. By a local/global
method, we also compute in terms of Asai gamma factors the proportionality constants involved in
their functional equations with respect to certain intertwining operators. As a consequence,
we classify distinguished unitary and ladder representations of $G$, extending respectively
the results of the author and Gurevich for $D=F$, which both relied at some crucial step on the theory
of Bernstein-Zelevinsky derivatives. We make use of a result of Beuzart-Plessis, which in the case
of the group $G$, asserts that the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence preserves distinction. Such
a result is for essentially square-integrable representations, but our method in fact allows us
to use it only for cuspidal representations of $G$.
