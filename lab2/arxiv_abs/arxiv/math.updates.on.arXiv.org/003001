In his seminal 1967 paper "Disjointness in ergodic theory, minimal sets, and a problem in Diophantine
approximation" Furstenberg introduced the notion of disjointness of dynamical systems, both
topological and measure preserving. In this paper he showed that for actions of the integers the
Bernoulli system $\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{Z}$, is disjoint from every minimal system, and that
the subring $R_0$, over the field $\mathbb{Z}_2 =\{0, 1\}$, generated by the minimal functions
in $\Omega$, is a proper subset of $\Omega$. He conjectured that a similar result holds in general
and in our 1983 work "Interpolation sets for subalgebras of $l^\infty(\mathbb{Z})$" we confirmed
this by showing that the closed subalgebra $\mathfrak{A}$ of $l^\infty(\mathbb{Z})$, generated
by the minimal functions, is a proper subalgebra of $l^\infty(\mathbb{Z})$. In this work we generalize
these results to a large class of groups. We call a countable group $G$ a DJ group if for every metrizable
minimal action of $G$ there exists an essentially free minimal action disjoint from it. We show that
amenable groups are DJ and that the DJ property is preserved under direct products. We define a simple
dynamical condition DDJ on minimal systems, which is a strengthening of the Gottchalk-Hedlund
property, and we say that a group $G$ is DDJ if every minimal $G$-system has this property. The DJ property
implies DDJ and by means of an intricate construction we show that every finitely generated DDJ group
is also DJ. Residually finite, maximally almost periodic and $C^*$-simple groups are all DDJ. Finally
we show that Furstenberg's conjecture holds for every DDJ group.
