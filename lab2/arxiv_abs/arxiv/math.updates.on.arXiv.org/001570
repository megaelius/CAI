We introduce new estimators for robust machine learning based on median-of-means (MOM) estimators
of the mean of real valued random variables. These estimators achieve optimal rates of convergence
under minimal assumptions on the dataset. The dataset may also have been corrupted by outliers on
which no assumption is granted. We also analyze these new estimators with standard tools from robust
statistics. In particular, we revisit the concept of breakdown point. We modify the original definition
by studying the number of outliers that a dataset can contain without deteriorating the estimation
properties of a given estimator. This new notion of breakdown number, that takes into account the
statistical performances of the estimators, is non-asymptotic in nature and adapted for machine
learning purposes. We proved that the breakdown number of our estimator is of the order of (number
of observations)*(rate of convergence). For instance, the breakdown number of our estimators
for the problem of estimation of a d-dimensional vector with a noise variance sigma^2 is sigma^2d
and it becomes sigma^2 s log(d/s) when this vector has only s non-zero component. Beyond this breakdown
point, we proved that the rate of convergence achieved by our estimator is (number of outliers) divided
by (number of observation). Besides these theoretical guarantees, the major improvement brought
by these new estimators is that they are easily computable in practice. In fact, basically any algorithm
used to approximate the standard Empirical Risk Minimizer (or its regularized versions) has a robust
version approximating our estimators. As a proof of concept, we study many algorithms for the classical
LASSO estimator. A byproduct of the MOM algorithms is a measure of depth of data that can be used to
detect outliers.
