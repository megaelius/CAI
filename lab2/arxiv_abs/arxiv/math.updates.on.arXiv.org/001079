We develop and analyze an ordinary differential equation model to assess the potential effectiveness
of infecting mosquitoes with the Wolbachia bacteria to control the ongoing mosquito-borne epidemics,
such as dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Wolbachia is a natural parasitic microbe that stops
the proliferation of the harmful viruses inside the mosquito and reduces disease transmission.
It is difficult to sustain an infection of the maternal transmitted Wolbachia in a wild mosquito
population because of the reduced fitness of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and cytoplasmic
incompatibility limiting maternal transmission. The infection will only persist if the fraction
of the infected mosquitoes exceeds a minimum threshold. Our two-sex mosquito model captures the
complex transmission-cycle by accounting for heterosexual transmission, multiple pregnant
states for female mosquitoes, and the aquatic-life stage. We identify important dimensionless
numbers and analyze the critical threshold condition for obtaining a sustained Wolbachia infection
in the natural population. This threshold effect is characterized by a backward bifurcation with
three coexisting equilibria of the system of differential equations: a stable disease-free equilibrium,
an unstable intermediate-infection endemic equilibrium and a stable high-infection endemic
equilibrium. We perform sensitivity analysis on epidemiological and environmental parameters
to determine their relative importance to Wolbachia transmission and prevalence. We also compare
the effectiveness of different integrated mitigation strategies and observe that the most efficient
approach to establish the Wolbachia infection is to first reduce the natural mosquitoes and then
release both infected males and pregnant females. The initial reduction of natural population
could be accomplished by either residual spraying or ovitraps.
