This paper considers uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with lowresolution
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) over Rician fading channels. Maximum-ratio-combining
(MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers are considered under the assumption of perfect and imperfect
channel state information (CSI). Low-resolution ADCs are considered for both data detection and
channel estimation, and the resulting performance is analyzed. Asymptotic approximations of
the spectrum efficiency (SE) for large systems are derived based on random matrix theory. With these
results, we can provide insights into the trade-offs between the SE and the ADC resolution and study
the influence of the Rician K-factors on the performance. It is shown that a large value of K-factors
may lead to better performance and alleviate the influence of quantization noise on channel estimation.
Moreover, we investigate the power scaling laws for both receivers under imperfect CSI and it shows
that when the number of base station (BS) antennas is very large, without loss of SE performance,
the transmission power can be scaled by the number of BS antennas for both receivers while the overall
performance is limited by the resolution of ADCs. The asymptotic analysis is validated by numerical
results. Besides, it is also shown that the SE gap between the two receivers is narrowed down when
the K-factor is increased. We also show that ADCs with moderate resolutions lead to better energy
efficiency (EE) than that with high-resolution or extremely low-resolution ADCs and using ZF receivers
achieve higher EE as compared with the MRC receivers.
