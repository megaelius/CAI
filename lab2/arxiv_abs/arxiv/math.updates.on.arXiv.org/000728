We consider non-linear time-fractional stochastic heat type equation $$\partial^\beta_tu_t(x)=-\nu(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}
u_t(x)+I^{1-\beta}_t[\sigma(u)\stackrel{\cdot}{W}(t,x)]$$ in $(d+1)$ dimensions, where
$\nu>0, \beta\in (0,1)$, $\alpha\in (0,2]$ and $d<\min\{2,\beta^{-1}\}\a$, $\partial^\beta_t$
is the Caputo fractional derivative, $-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} $ is the generator of an isotropic
stable process, $I^{1-\beta}_t$ is the fractional integral operator, $\stackrel{\cdot}{W}(t,x)$
is space-time white noise, and $\sigma:\RR{R}\to\RR{R}$ is Lipschitz continuous. Time fractional
stochastic heat type equations might be used to model phenomenon with random effects with thermal
memory. We prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to this equation and establish conditions
under which the solution is continuous. Our results extend the results in the case of parabolic stochastic
partial differential equations obtained in \cite{foondun-khoshnevisan-09, walsh}. In sharp
contrast to the stochastic partial differential equations studied earlier in \cite{foondun-khoshnevisan-09,
khoshnevisan-cbms, walsh}, in some cases our results give existence of random field solutions
in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$. Under faster than linear growth of $\sigma$, we show that time
fractional stochastic partial differential equation has no finite energy solution. This extends
the result of Foondun and Parshad \cite{foondun-parshad} in the case of parabolic stochastic partial
differential equations. We also establish a connection of the time fractional stochastic partial
differential equations to higher order parabolic stochastic differential equations.
