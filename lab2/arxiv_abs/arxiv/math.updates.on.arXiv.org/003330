Decades of advances in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and recent development in mixed-integer
second-order-cone programming (MISOCP) have translated very mildly to progresses in global solving
nonconvex mixed-integer quadratically constrained programs (MIQCP). In this paper we propose
a new approach, namely Compact Disjunctive Approximation (CDA), to approximate nonconvex MIQCP
to arbitrary precision by \textit{convex} MIQCPs, which can be solved by MISOCP solvers. For nonconvex
MIQCP with $n$ variables and $m$ general quadratic constraints, our method yields relaxations
with at most $O(n\log(1/\varepsilon))$ number of continuous/binary variables and linear constraints,
together with $m$ \textit{convex} quadratic constraints, where $\varepsilon$ is the approximation
accuracy. The main novelty of our method lies in a very compact lifted mixed-integer formulation
for approximating the (scalar) square function. This is derived by first embedding the square function
into the boundary of a three-dimensional second-order cone, and then exploiting rotational symmetry
in a similar way as in the construction of BenTal-Nemirovski approximation. We further show that
this lifted formulation characterize the union of finite number of simple convex sets, which naturally
relax the square function in a piecewise manner with properly placed knots. We implement (with JuMP)
a simple adaptive refinement algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthetic instances used in
the literature show that our prototypical implementation (with hundreds of lines of Julia code)
can already close a significant portion of gap left by various state-of-the-art global solvers
on more difficult instances, indicating strong promises of our proposed approach.
