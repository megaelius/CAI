Consider an affine Kac-Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra $\lh$. Given $\Lambda$
in the set $P_+$ of dominant integral weights of $\mathfrak{g}$, we denote by $L(\Lambda)$ the integrable
highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module with highest weight $\Lambda$. For $\mu\in \lh^*$, we denote
by $L(\Lambda)_\mu$ the corresponding weight space. Consider the support $\Gamma(\lg,\lh)$
of the decompositions of the $L(\Lambda)$ as a $\lh$-module: $$ \Gamma(\lg,\lh)=\{(\Lambda,\mu)\,:\,
L(\Lambda)_\mu\neq\{0\}\}. $$ Consider now the winding subalgebra $\mathfrak{g}[u]$ (for some
positive integer $u$). The winding subalgebra $\mathfrak{g}[u]$ is isomorphic to $\lg$ but with
a nontrivial embedding in $\lg$ depending on the parameter $u$. Given $\lambda$ in the set $\dot{P}_+$
of dominant integral weights of $\mathfrak{g}[u]$, we denote by $\dot{L}(\lambda)$ the integrable
highest weight $\mathfrak{g}[u]$-module with highest weight $\lambda$. Then the $\mathfrak{g}$-module
$L(\Lambda)$ decomposes as a direct sums of simple $\lg[u]$-modules $\dot{L}(\lambda)$ with
finite multiplicities. In this paper, we are interested in the supports of this decomposition,
i.e., the set of pairs $(\Lambda,\lambda)$ in $P_+ \times \dot{P}_+$ such that the integrable highest
weight $\mathfrak{g}[u]$-modules $\dot{L}(\lambda)$ is a submodule of $L(\Lambda)$. We show
that both $\Gamma(\lg,\lh)$ and $\Gamma(\lg,\lg[u])$ are semigroups. Moreover, for the cases
$A^{(1)}_1$ and $A^{(2)}_2$, we determine explicitly $\Gamma(\lg,\lh)$. Finaly, we describe
explicit subsets of $P_+ \times \dot{P}_+$ where the two semigroups coincide.
