Recently Fraser and Schoen showed that the solution of a certain extremal Steklov eigenvalue problem
on a compact surface with boundary can be used to generate a free boundary minimal surface, i.e.,
a surface contained in the ball that has (i) zero mean curvature and (ii) meets the boundary of the
ball orthogonally (doi:10.1007/s00222-015-0604-x). In this paper, we develop numerical methods
that use this connection to realize free boundary minimal surfaces. Namely, on a compact surface,
$\Sigma$, with genus $\gamma$ and $b$ boundary components, we maximize $\sigma_j(\Sigma,g) \
L(\partial \Sigma, g)$ over a class of smooth metrics, $g$, where $\sigma_j(\Sigma,g)$ is the $j$-th
nonzero Steklov eigenvalue and $L(\partial \Sigma, g)$ is the length of $\partial \Sigma$. Our
numerical method involves (i) using conformal uniformization of multiply connected domains to
avoid explicit parameterization for the class of metrics, (ii) accurately solving a boundary-weighted
Steklov eigenvalue problem in multi-connected domains, and (iii) developing gradient-based
optimization methods for this non-smooth eigenvalue optimization problem. For genus $\gamma
=0$ and $b=2,\dots, 9, 12, 15, 20$ boundary components, we numerically solve the extremal Steklov
problem for the first eigenvalue. The corresponding eigenfunctions generate a free boundary minimal
surface, which we display in striking images. For higher eigenvalues, numerical evidence suggests
that the maximizers are degenerate, but we compute local maximizers for the second and third eigenvalues
with $b=2$ boundary components and for the third and fifth eigenvalues with $b=3$ boundary components.
