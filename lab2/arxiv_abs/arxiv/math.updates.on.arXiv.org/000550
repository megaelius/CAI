The motivic nearby fiber is an invariant obtained from degenerating a complex variety over a disc.
It specializes to the Euler characteristic of the original variety but also contains information
on the variation of Hodge structure associated to the degeneration which is encoded as a limit mixed
Hodge structure. However, this invariant is difficult to compute in practice. Using the techniques
of tropical geometry we present a new formula for the motivic nearby fiber. Moreover, since there
is a range of available software implementing the main algorithms in tropical geometry, our formula
can be computed in practice. We specialize to the case of families of sch\"{o}n complex hypersurfaces
of tori where we provide explicit formulas describing the action of the unipotent part of monodromy
on the graded pieces (with respect to the Deligne weight filtration) of the cohomology with compact
supports. These families are described combinatorially by a polyhedral subdivision of the associated
Newton polytope. We develop new mixed Hodge theory-inspired combinatorial invariants of such
subdivisions, among them the `refined limit mixed $h^*$-polynomial'. These invariants are related
to Stanley's combinatorial study of subdivisions: in a companion combinatorial paper whose results
are applied here, we situate our invariants in Stanley's theory where they become multi-variable
extensions of his invariants. Our results generalize work of Danilov and Khovanski{\u\i} and Batyrev
and Borisov on the Hodge numbers of hypersurfaces. We also present analogous formulas describing
the action of the unipotent part of monodromy on the intersection cohomology groups of a family of
sch\"on hypersurfaces of a projective toric variety.
