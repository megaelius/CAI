A split tree of cardinality $n$ is constructed by distributing $n$ "balls" (which often represent
"key numbers") in a subset of vertices of an infinite tree. In this work, we study Bernoulli bond percolation
on arbitrary split trees of large but finite cardinality $n$. We show for appropriate percolation
regimes that depend on the cardinality $n$ of the split tree that there exists a unique giant cluster
that is of size comparable of that of the entire tree (where size is defined as either the number of
vertices or the number of balls). The main result shows that in such percolation regimes, also known
as supercritical regimes, the fluctuations of the size of the giant cluster are non-Gaussian as
$n \rightarrow \infty$. Instead, they are described by an infinitely divisible distribution that
belongs to the class of stable Cauchy laws. This work is a generalization of the results for the random
$m$-ary recursive trees due to Berzunza, which is one specific case of split trees. Other important
examples of split trees include $m$-ary search trees, quad trees, median-of-$(2k+1)$ trees, fringe-balanced
trees, digital search trees and random simplex trees. Our approach is based on a remarkable decomposition
of the size of the giant percolation cluster as a sum of essentially independent random variables
which allows us to apply a classical limit theorem for the convergence of triangular arrays to infinitely
divisible distributions. This may be of independent interest and it may be useful for studying percolation
on other classes of trees with logarithmic height, for instance in this work we study also the case
of regular trees.
