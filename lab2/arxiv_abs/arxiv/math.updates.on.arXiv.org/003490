In this article we present the algebraic rearrangement, or matrix inversion of the Dirac equation
in a curved Riemann-Cartan spacetime with torsion, the presence of non-vanishing torsion is implied
by the intrinsic spin-1/2 of the Dirac field. We then demonstrate how the inversion leads to a reformulation
of the fully non-linear and self-interactive Einstein-Cartan-Dirac field equations in terms
of Dirac bilinears. It has been known for some decades that the Dirac equation for charged fermions
interacting with an electromagnetic field can be algebraically inverted, so as to obtain an explicit
rational expression of the four-vector potential of the gauge field in terms of the spinors. Substitution
of this expression into Maxwell's equations yields the bilinear form of the self-interactive Maxwell-Dirac
equations. In the present (purely gravitational) case, the inversion process yields \emph{two}
rational four-vector expressions in terms of Dirac bilinears, which act as gravitational analogues
of the electromagnetic vector potential. These "potentials" also appear as irreducible summand
components of the connection, along with a traceless residual term of mixed symmetry. When taking
the torsion field equation into account, the residual term can be written as a function of the object
of anholonomity. Using the local tetrad frame associated with observers co-moving with the Dirac
matter, a generic vierbein frame can described in terms of four Dirac bilinear vector fields, normalized
by a scalar and pseudoscalar field. A corollary of this is that in regions where the Dirac field is
non-vanishing, the self-coupled Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations can in principle be expressed
in terms of Dirac bilinears only.
