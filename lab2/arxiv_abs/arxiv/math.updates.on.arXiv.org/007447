We study stochastic team (known also as decentralized stochastic control or identical interest
stochastic dynamic game) problems with large or countably infinite number of decision makers,
and characterize existence and structural properties for (globally) optimal policies. We consider
both static and dynamic non-convex team problems where the cost function and dynamics satisfy an
exchangeability condition. We first establish a de Finetti type representation theorem for decentralized
strategic measures, that is, for the probability measures induced by admissible relaxed control
policies under decentralized information structures. This leads to a representation theorem
for strategic measures which admit an infinite exchangeability condition. For a general setup
of stochastic team problems with $N$ decision makers, under exchangeability of observations of
decision makers and the cost function, we show that without loss of global optimality, the search
for optimal policies can be restricted to those that are $N$-exchangeable. Then, by extending $N$-exchangeable
policies to infinitely exchangeable ones, establishing a convergence argument for the induced
costs, and using the presented de Finetti type theorem, we establish the existence of an optimal
decentralized policy for static and dynamic teams with countably infinite number of decision makers,
which turns out to be symmetric (i.e., identical) and randomized. In particular, unlike prior work,
the convexity of the cost is not assumed. Finally, we show near optimality of symmetric independently
randomized policies for finite $N$-decision maker team problems and thus establish approximation
results for $N$-decision maker weakly coupled stochastic teams.
