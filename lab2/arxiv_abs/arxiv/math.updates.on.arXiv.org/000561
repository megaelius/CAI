This paper extends the fundamental results of frame theory to a non-commutative setting where the
role of locales is taken over by \'etale localic categories. This involves ideas from quantale theory
and from semigroup theory, specifically Ehresmann semigroups, restriction semigroups and inverse
semigroups. We establish a duality between the category of complete restriction monoids and the
category of \'etale localic categories. The relationship between monoids and categories is mediated
by a class of quantales called restriction quantal frames. This result builds on the work of Pedro
Resende on the connection between pseudogroups and \'etale localic groupoids but in the process
we both generalize and simplify: for example, we do not require involutions and, in addition, we
render his result functorial. We also project down to topological spaces and, as a result, extend
the classical adjunction between locales and topological spaces to an adjunction between \'etale
localic categories and \'etale topological categories. In fact, varying morphisms, we obtain
several adjunctions. Just as in the commutative case, we restrict these adjunctions to spatial-sober
and coherent-spectral equivalences. The classical equivalence between coherent frames and distributive
lattices is extended to an equivalence between coherent complete restriction monoids and distributive
restriction semigroups. Consequently, we deduce several dualities between distributive restriction
semigroups and spectral \'etale topological categoties. We also specialize these dualities for
the setting where the topological categories are cancellative or are groupoids. Our approach thus
links, unifies and extends the approaches taken in the work by Lawson and Lenz and by Resende.
