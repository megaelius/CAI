In 1994, Thomassen proved that every planar graph is 5-list-colorable. In 1995, Thomassen proved
that every planar graph of girth at least five is 3-list-colorable. His proofs naturally lead to
quadratic-time algorithms to find such colorings. Here, we provide the first such linear-time
algorithms to find such colorings. For a fixed surface S, Thomassen showed in 1997 that there exists
a linear-time algorithm to decide if a graph embedded in S is 5-colorable and similarly in 2003 if
a graph of girth at least five embedded in S is 3-colorable. Using the theory of hyperbolic families,
the author and Thomas showed such algorithms exist for list-colorings. Dvorak and Kawarabayashi
actually gave an $O(n^{O(g+1)})$-time algorithm to find such colorings (if they exist) in n-vertex
graphs where g is the Euler genus of the surface. Here we provide the first such algorithm whose exponent
does not depend on the genus; indeed, we provide a linear-time algorithm. In 1988, Goldberg, Plotkin
and Shannon provided a deterministic distributed algorithm for 7-coloring n-vertex planar graphs
in $O(\log n)$ rounds. In 2018, Aboulker, Bonamy, Bousquet, and Esperet provided a deterministic
distributed algorithm for 6-coloring n-vertex planar graphs in $O(\log^3 n)$ rounds. Their algorithm
in fact works for 6-list-coloring. They also provided an $O(\log^3 n)$-round algorithm for 4-list-coloring
triangle-free planar graphs. Chechik and Mukhtar independently obtained such algorithms for
ordinary coloring in $O(\log n)$ rounds, which is best possible in terms of running time. Here we
provide the first polylogarithmic deterministic distributed algorithms for 5-coloring n-vertex
planar graphs and similarly for 3-coloring planar graphs of girth at least five. Indeed, these algorithms
run in $O(\log n)$ rounds, work also for list-colorings, and even work on a fixed surface (assuming
such a coloring exists).
