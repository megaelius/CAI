Circulant tensors are special kinds of Toeplitz tensors, which naturally arise from signal processing
methods involving higher-order statistics. In this paper, we explore the structure and properties
of circulant tensors. For an $m$ order $n$-dimensional circulant tensor, we define two $m-1$ order
$n$-dimensional tensors, which we call the root tensor and the associated tensor of that circulant
tensor. We prove that if the root tensor is (strictly) copositive, then the circulant tensor is also
(strictly) copositive. We show that all the eigenvalues of a circulant tensor $\A$ lie in a disk.
The center of that disk is the diagonal entry of $\A$. The radius of that disk is the sum of the absolute
values of the associated tensor of $\A$. We show that the sum of all the entries of the root tensor of
$\A$ is always an H-eigenvalue of $\A$, which we call the first native eigenvalue of $\A$. We show
that when the associated tensor is a nonnegative (non-positive) tensor, the first native eigenvalue
of $\A$ is the largest (smallest) H-eigenvalue of $\A$. In particular, when $m$ is even and the associated
tensor is non-positive, $\A$ is positive semi-definite if and only if its first native eigenvalue
is nonnegative. When $n$ is even, there is another native H-eigenvalue of $\A$, which plays a similar
role in some other cases. We show that the symmetrization of a Toeplitz tensor is still a Toeplitz
tensor, and the symmetrization of a circulant tensor is still a circulant tensor. We give a necessary
and sufficient condition for a circulant tensor to be symmetric. We study circulant tensors with
diagonal root tensors, and doubly circulant tensors respectively.
