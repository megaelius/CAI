We study the algebra generated by the adjacency operators on an edge-coloured graph. We stress the
importance of graphs endowed with a certain type of distance function, defined on the set of vertices,
and taking its values in the adjacency algebra. These include, in particular, the graphs on which
a group acts strongly transitively, in a certain sense, as well as all association schemes, and all
buildings in the sense of Tits. About buidings, we prove more specifically that the usual distance
function with values in the associated Coxeter group can be taken to define a distance with values
in the adjacency algebra, which is itself none other than the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebra.
We also prove that strong transitivity in our sense reduces, in the case of buildings, to the standard
notion of transitivity on pairs of incident chambers and appartments. We give a number of examples,
and in particular we study the adjacency algebra of (the chamber system of) an affine plane (this
is neither a building nor an association scheme). We describe this algebra completely, showing
that it depends only on the order of the plane; we show that a distance function as above always exists;
and we show that, when an affine plane admits a strongly transitive action in our sense, it must be
Desarguesian. We study circle geometries in the same fashion. Both situations involve a deformation
of the group algebra of the symmetric group of degree 3, which is similar to a Iwahori-Hecke algebra,
yet different. The representation theory of these algebras is worked out. We conclude by associating
an algebra to each Buekenhout diagram. The adjacency algebra of (the chamber system of) a geometry
which belongs to a given diagram is a homomorphic image of the latter. Many open questions arise.
