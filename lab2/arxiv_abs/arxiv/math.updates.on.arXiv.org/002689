The $L^2$ geometry of moduli spaces of self-dual solutions of a gauged nonlinear sigma model with
target space $\mathbb{P}^1$ on a surface $\Sigma$ is studied. This model allows two different species
of soliton to coexist which have equal but opposite magnetic flux, conventionally called vortices
and antivortices. The moduli space $M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$ of solutions with $k_+$ vortices
and $k_-$ antivortices is a K\"ahler manifold of complex dimension $k_++k_-$. For $k_+$ and $k_-$
both positive, it is noncompact even if $\Sigma$ is compact, and this makes the study of its global
geometry a significant challenge. A localization formula is derived expressing the $L^2$ metric
on $M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$ in terms of data defined at the (anti)vortex cores. Vortex-antivortex
pairs on $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}^2$ are constructed numerically and precise asymptotic formulae
for the $L^2$ metric on $M_{(1,1)}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ in the limits of small and large soliton separation
conjectured. These conjectures imply that $M_{(1,1)}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is geodesically incomplete
with scalar curvature unbounded above. For $\Sigma=S^2_R$, the $L^2$ metric on $M_{(1,1)}(S_R^2)$
is studied in detail; its volume is computed, and it is shown to be geodesically incomplete. For arbitrary
compact $\Sigma$, a natural compactification of $M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$ as a complex manifold
supporting a family of approximating metrics is constructed by resorting to an auxiliary gauged
linear sigma model. This is used to obtain conjectural formulae for the volume and total scalar curvature
of $M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$. The volume formulae agree with the result established for Vol($M_{(1,1)}(S_R^2)$),
and they allow for a detailed study of the thermodynamics of vortex-antivortex gas mixtures: it
is found that the equation of state is independent of the genus of $\Sigma$, and that the entropy of
mixing is always positive.
