We analyse nonlinear tipping phenomena in a bi-stable ecosystem model, defined as critical transitions
from the herbivore-dominating equilibrium to the plant-only equilibrium, which are triggered
by environmental changes represented by time-varying parameters. We obtain simple criteria for
tipping in terms of properties of the autonomous system with fixed in time parameters. Specifically,
classical bifurcation analysis identifies a codimension-three degenerate Bogdanov-Takens
bifurcation: the organising centre for bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping) and the source
of a dangerous subcritical Hopf bifurcation. We introduce basin instability analysis to identify
parameter paths along which rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) is guaranteed to occur without crossing
any bifurcation. We then produce tipping diagrams for the non-autonomous system with time-varying
parameters in the plane of the magnitude and rate of a parameter shift to reveal tipping-tracking
transitions due to canard-like solutions and nontrivial dynamics arising from the interaction
between B-tipping and R-tipping. Given a monotone parameter shift that causes tipping, we ask if
tipping can be prevented upon a parameter trend reversal. The ensuing analysis of non-monotone
parameter shifts reveals an intriguing tipping diagram with a single critical level and multiple
critical rates, indicating that the system switches from tipping to tracking and back to tipping
again as the rate of the parameter shift increases. In the diagram, we identify points of no return
where tipping cannot be prevented by the parameter trend reversal and points of return tipping where
tipping is inadvertently induced by the parameter trend reversal. A comparison of the ecosystem
model with modified saddle-node and subcritical Hopf normal forms shows the results are characteristic
of a non-monotone passage through a generic dangerous bifurcation.
