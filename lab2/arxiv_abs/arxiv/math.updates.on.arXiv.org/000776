We compute explicitly Dirichlet generating functions enumerating finite-dimensional irreducible
complex representations of various $p$-adic analytic and adelic profinite groups of type $\mathsf{A}_2$.
This has consequences for the representation zeta functions of arithmetic groups $\Gamma \subset
\mathbf{H}(k)$, where $k$ is a number field and $\mathbf{H}$ a $k$-form of $\mathsf{SL}_3$: assuming
that $\Gamma$ possesses the strong Congruence Subgroup Property, we obtain precise, uniform estimates
for the representation growth of $\Gamma$. Our results are based on explicit, uniform formulae
for the representation zeta functions of the $p$-adic analytic groups $\mathsf{SL}_3(\mathfrak{o})$
and $\mathsf{SU}_3(\mathfrak{o})$, where $\mathfrak{o}$ is a compact discrete valuation ring
of characteristic $0$. These formulae build on our classification of similarity classes of integral
$\mathfrak{p}$-adic $3\times3$ matrices in $\mathfrak{gl}_3(\mathfrak{o})$ and $\mathfrak{gu}_3(\mathfrak{o})$,
where $\mathfrak{o}$ is a compact discrete valuation ring of arbitrary characteristic. Organising
the similarity classes by invariants which we call their shadows allows us to combine the Kirillov
orbit method with Clifford theory to obtain explicit formulae for representation zeta functions.
In a different direction we introduce and compute certain similarity class zeta functions. Our
methods also yield formulae for representation zeta functions of various finite subquotients
of groups of the form $\mathsf{SL}_3(\mathfrak{o})$, $\mathsf{SU}_3(\mathfrak{o})$, $\mathsf{GL}_3(\mathfrak{o})$,
and $\mathsf{GU}_3(\mathfrak{o})$, arising from the respective congruence filtrations; these
formulae are valid in case that the characteristic of $\mathfrak{o}$ is either $0$ or sufficiently
large. Analysis of some of these formulae leads us to observe $p$-adic analogues of `Ennola duality'.
