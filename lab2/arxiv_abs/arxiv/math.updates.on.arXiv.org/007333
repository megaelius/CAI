Hybrid analog-digital (A/D) transceivers designed for millimeter wave (mmWave) systems have
received substantial research attention, as a benefit of their lower cost and modest energy consumption
compared to their fully-digital counterparts. We further improve their performance by conceiving
a Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) based nonlinear joint design for the downlink of multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mmWave systems. Our optimization criterion is that of
minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the system under channel uncertainties subject both to
realistic transmit power constraint and to the unit modulus constraint imposed on the elements
of the analog beamforming (BF) matrices governing the BF operation in the radio frequency domain.
We transform this optimization problem into a more tractable form and develop an efficient block
coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm for solving it. Then, a novel two-timescale nonlinear
joint hybrid transceiver design algorithm is developed, which can be viewed as an extension of the
BCD-based joint design algorithm for reducing both the channel state information (CSI) signalling
overhead and the effects of outdated CSI. Moreover, we determine the near-optimal cancellation
order for the THP structure based on the lower bound of the MSE. The proposed algorithms can be guaranteed
to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the original problem. The simulation results
demonstrate that our proposed nonlinear joint hybrid transceiver design algorithms significantly
outperform the existing linear hybrid transceiver algorithms and approach the performance of
the fully-digital transceiver, despite its lower cost and power dissipation.
