We consider three different models of sparse random graphs:~undirected and directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
graphs, and random bipartite graph with an equal number of left and right vertices. For such graphs
we show that if the edge connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$ satisfies $n p \ge \log n + k(n)$ with
$k(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, then the adjacency matrix is invertible with probability approaching
one (here $n$ is the number of vertices in the two former cases and the number of left and right vertices
in the latter case). If $np \le \log n -k(n)$ then these matrices are invertible with probability
approaching zero, as $n \to \infty$. In the intermediate region, when $np=\log n + k(n)$, for a bounded
sequence $k(n) \in \mathbb{R}$, the event $\Omega_0$ that the adjacency matrix has a zero row or
a column and its complement both have non-vanishing probability. For such choices of $p$ our results
show that conditioned on the event $\Omega_0^c$ the matrices are again invertible with probability
tending to one. This shows that the primary reason for the non-invertibility of such matrices is
the existence of a zero row or a column. The bounds on the probability of the invertibility of these
matrices are a consequence of quantitative lower bounds on their smallest singular values. Combining
this with an upper bound on the largest singular value of the centered version of these matrices we
show that the (modified) condition number is $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ on the event that there is no zero row
or column, with large probability. This matches with von Neumann's prediction about the condition
number of random matrices up to a factor of $n^{o(1)}$, for the entire range of $p$.
