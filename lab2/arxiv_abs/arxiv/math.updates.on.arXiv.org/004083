Under current policy decision making paradigm, we make or evaluate a policy decision by intervening
different socio-economic parameters and analyzing the impact of those interventions. This process
involves identifying the causal relation between interventions and outcomes. Matching method
is one of the popular techniques to identify such causal relations. However, in one-to-one matching,
when a treatment or control unit has multiple pair assignment options with similar match quality,
different matching algorithms often assign different pairs. Since, all the matching algorithms
assign pair without considering the outcomes, it is possible that with same data and same hypothesis,
different experimenters can make different conclusions. This problem becomes more prominent
in case of large-scale observational studies. Recently, a robust approach is proposed to tackle
the uncertainty which uses discrete optimization techniques to explore all possible assignments.
Though optimization techniques are very efficient in its own way, they are not scalable to big data.
In this work, we consider causal inference testing with binary outcomes and propose computationally
efficient algorithms that are scalable to large-scale observational studies. By leveraging the
structure of the optimization model, we propose a robustness condition which further reduces the
computational burden. We validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms by testing the causal
relation between Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) and readmission to different
hospital (non-index readmission) on the State of California Patient Discharge Database from 2010
to 2014. Our result shows that HRRP has a causal relation with the increase in non-index readmission
and the proposed algorithms proved to be highly scalable in testing causal relations from large-scale
observational studies.
