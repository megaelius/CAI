Since their introduction by Erd\H{o}s in 1950, covering systems (that is, finite collections of
arithmetic progressions that cover the integers) have been extensively studied, and numerous
questions and conjectures have been posed regarding the existence of covering systems with various
properties. In particular, Erd\H{o}s asked if the moduli can be distinct and all arbitrarily large,
Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge asked if the moduli can be distinct and all odd, and Schinzel conjectured
that in any covering system there exists a pair of moduli, one of which divides the other. Another
beautiful conjecture, proposed by Erd\H{o}s and Graham in 1980, states that if the moduli are distinct
elements of the interval $[n,Cn]$, and $n$ is sufficiently large, then the density of integers uncovered
by the union is bounded below by a constant (depending only on $C$). This conjecture was confirmed
(in a strong form) by Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance and Yu in 2007, who moreover asked whether
the same conclusion holds if the moduli are distinct and sufficiently large, and $\sum_{i=1}^k
\frac{1}{d_i} < C$. Although this condition turns out not to be sufficiently strong to imply the
desired conclusion, as the main result of this paper we will give an essentially best possible condition
which is sufficient. Our method has a number of further applications. Most importantly, we prove
the conjecture of Schinzel stated above, which was made in 1967. We moreover give an alternative
(somewhat simpler) proof of a breakthrough result of Hough, who resolved Erd\H{o}s' minimum modulus
problem, with an improved bound on the smallest difference. Finally, we make further progress on
the problem of Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge.
