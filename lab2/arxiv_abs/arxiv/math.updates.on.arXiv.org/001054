Starting from a comparison of some established numerical algorithms for the computation of the
eigenvalues (discrete or solitonic spectrum) of the non-Hermitian version of the Zakharov-Shabat
spectral problem, this article delivers new algorithms that combine the best features of the existing
ones and thereby allays their relative weaknesses. Our algorithm is modelled within the remit of
the so-called direct nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) associated with the focusing nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation. First, we present the data for the calibration of methods comparing the
relative errors associated with the computation of the continuous NF spectrum. Then each method
is paired with different numerical algorithms for finding zeros of a complex-valued function to
obtain the eigenvalues. Next we describe a new class of methods based on the contour integrals evaluation
for the efficient search of eigenvalues. After that, we introduce a new hybrid method, one of our
main results: the method combines the advances of contour integral approach and makes use of the
iterative algorithms at its second stage for the refined eigenvalues search. The veracity of our
new hybrid algorithm is established by estimating the convergence speed and accuracy across three
independent test profiles. Along with the development of a new approach for the computation of the
eigenvalues, our study also addresses the problem of computation of the so-called norming constants
associated with the eigenvalues. We show that our formalism effectively amounts to accurate and
fast enough computation of residues of the reflection coefficient in the upper complex half-plane
of the spectral parameter.
