In the present paper, we study the Cauchy problem for the wave equation with a time-dependent scale
invariant damping $\frac{2}{1+t}\partial_t v$ and a cubic convolution $(|x|^{-\gamma}*v^2)v$
with $\gamma\in \left(-\frac{1}{2},3\right)$ in three spatial dimension for initial data $\left(v(x,0),\partial_tv(x,0)\right)\in
C^2(\mathbb{R}^3)\times C^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with a compact support, where $v=v(x,t)$ is an unknown
function to the problem on $\mathbb{R}^3\times[0,T)$. Here $T$ denotes a maximal existence time
of $v$. The first aim of the present paper is to prove unique global existence of the solution to the
problem and asymptotic behavior of the solution in the supercritical case $\gamma\in (0,3)$, and
show a lower estimate of the lifespan in the critical or subcritical case $\gamma\in \left(-\frac{1}{2},0\right]$.
The essential part for their proofs is to derive a weaker estimate under the weaker condition than
the case without damping and to recover the weakness by the effect of the dissipative term. The second
aim of the present paper is to prove a small data blow-up and the almost sharp upper estimate of the
lifespan for positive data with a compact support in the subcritical case $\gamma\in \left(-\frac{1}{2},0\right)$.
The essential part for the proof is to refine the argument for the proof of Theorem 6.1 in \cite{H20}
to obtain the upper estimate of the lifespan. Our two results determine that a critical exponent
$\gamma_c$ which divides global existence and blow-up for small solutions is $0$, namely $\gamma_c=0$.
As the result, we can see that the critical exponent shift from $2$ to $0$ due to the effect of the scale
invariant damping term.
