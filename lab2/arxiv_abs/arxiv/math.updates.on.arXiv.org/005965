The main objects under consideration in this thesis are called maps, a certain class of graphs embedded
on surfaces. Our problems have a powerful relatively recent tool in common, the so-called topological
recursion (TR) introduced by Chekhov, Eynard and Orantin. We call a map fully simple if it has non
self-intersecting disjoint boundaries, and ordinary if such a restriction is not imposed. We study
the combinatorial relation between fully simple and ordinary maps with the topology of a disk or
a cylinder, which reproduces relations between moments and free cumulants established in the context
of free probability. We propose a combinatorial interpretation of the exchange symplectic transformation
of TR. We provide a matrix model interpretation for fully simple maps via the formal hermitian matrix
model with external field and deduce a universal relation between generating series of fully simple
and ordinary maps, which involves double monotone Hurwitz numbers. In particular, we obtain an
ELSV-like formula for double $2$-orbifold strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers. We consider ordinary
maps endowed with an $O(\mathsf{n})$ loop model, which is a classical model in statistical physics,
and determine which shapes are more likely to occur by looking at the nesting properties of the loops
decorating the maps. We want to study the limiting objects when the number of vertices becomes arbitrarily
large, which can be done by studying the generating series at dominant singularities. We analyze
the nesting statistics in the $O(\mathsf{n})$ loop model on random maps of arbitrary topologies
in the presence of large and small boundaries, relying on previous results for disks and cylinders
and TR for this model. We study the generating series of maps which realize a fixed nesting graph and
characterize their critical behavior in the dense and dilute phases.
