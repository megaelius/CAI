Numerous high-thrust and low-thrust space propulsion technologies have been developed in the
recent years with the goal of expanding space exploration capabilities; however, designing and
optimizing a multi-mission campaign with both high-thrust and low-thrust propulsion options
are generally computationally challenging due to the coupling between logistics mission design
and trajectory evaluation. More specifically, this computational burden arises from the dependence
of the $\Delta$v and time of flight for low-thrust trajectories on the payload mass, which in turn
needs to be evaluated together with the logistics mission design. To tackle this challenge, this
paper develops a novel event-driven space logistics network optimization approach using mixed-integer
linear programming for campaign-level space mission design. The specific case of optimally designing
a cislunar propellant resupply chain to support multiple lunar surface access missions is used
to demonstrate this new space logistics framework. Surrogate models for trajectory evaluation
are developed and integrated into mission design to enable internal trade-offs between available
propulsion technology options. The results are compared with an existing stochastic combinatorial
formulation developed for incorporating low-thrust propulsion into space logistics design.
Our new approach provides superior results in terms of cost as well as utilization of the vehicle
fleet. The developed event-driven space logistics network optimization method can trade off cost,
time, and technology in an automated manner to optimally design space mission campaigns.
