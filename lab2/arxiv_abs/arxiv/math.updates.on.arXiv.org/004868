In this paper, we carry out numerical bifurcation analysis of depinning of fronts near the homoclinic
snaking region, involving a spatial stripe cellular pattern embedded in a quiescent state, in the
two-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation with either a quadratic-cubic or cubic-quintic nonlinearity.
We focus on depinning fronts involving stripes that are orientated either parallel, oblique and
perpendicular to the front interface, and almost planar depinning fronts. We show that invading
parallel depinning fronts select both a far-field wavenumber and a propagation wavespeed whereas
retreating parallel depinning fronts come in families where the wavespeed is a function of the far-field
wavenumber. Employing a far-field core decomposition, we propose a boundary value problem for
the invading depinning fronts which we numerically solve and use path-following routines to trace
out bifurcation diagrams. We then carry out a thorough numerical investigation of the parallel,
oblique, perpendicular stripe, and almost planar invasion fronts. We find that almost planar invasion
fronts in the cubic-quintic Swift-Hohenberg equation bifurcate off parallel invasion fronts
and co-exist close to the homoclinic snaking region. Sufficiently far from the 1D homoclinic snaking
region, no almost planar invasion fronts exist and we find that parallel invasion stripe fronts
may regain transverse stability if they propagate above a critical speed. Finally, we show that
depinning fronts shed light on the time simulations of fully localised patches of stripes on the
plane. The numerical algorithms detailed have wider application to general modulated fronts and
reaction-diffusion systems.
