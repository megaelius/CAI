We consider the imaginary time flow of a quadratic hyperbolic Hamiltonian on the symplectic plane,
apply it to the Schr\"odinger polarization and study the corresponding evolution of polarized
sections. The flow is periodic in imaginary time and the evolution of polarized sections has interesting
features. On the time intervals for which the polarization is real or K\"ahler, the half--form corrected
time evolution of polarized sections is given by unitary operators which turn out to be equivalent
to the classical Segal-Bargmann transforms (which are usually associated to the quadratic elliptic
Hamiltonian $H=\frac12 p^2$ and to the heat operator). At the right endpoint of these intervals,
the evolution of polarized sections is given by the Fourier transform from the Schr\"odinger to
the momentum representation. In the complementary intervals of imaginary time, the polarizations
are anti--K\"ahler and the Hilbert space of polarized sections collapses to ${\mathcal H}= \{0\}$.
Hyperbolic quadratic Hamiltonians thus give rise to a new factorization of the Segal-Bargmann
transform, which is very different from the usual one, where one first applies a bounded contraction
operator (the heat kernel operator), mapping $L^2$--states to real analytic functions with unique
analytic continuation, and then one applies analytic continuation. In the factorization induced
by an hyperbolic complexifier, both factors are unbounded operators but their composition is,
in the K\"ahler or real sectors, unitary. In another paper [KMNT], we explore the application of
the above family of unitary transforms to the definition of new holomorphic fractional Fourier
transforms.
