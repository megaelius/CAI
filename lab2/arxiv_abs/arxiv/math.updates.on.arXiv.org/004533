This paper introduces two straightforward, effective indices to evaluate the input data and the
data flowing through layers of a feedforward deep neural network. For classification problems,
the separation rate of target labels in the space of dataflow is explained as a key factor indicating
the performance of designed layers in improving the generalization of the network. According to
the explained concept, a shapeless distance-based evaluation index is proposed. Similarly, for
regression problems, the smoothness rate of target outputs in the space of dataflow is explained
as a key factor indicating the performance of designed layers in improving the generalization of
the network. According to the explained smoothness concept, a shapeless distance-based smoothness
index is proposed for regression problems. To consider more strictly concepts of separation and
smoothness, their extended versions are introduced, and by interpreting a regression problem
as a classification problem, it is shown that the separation and smoothness indices are related
together. Through four case studies, the profits of using the introduced indices are shown. In the
first case study, for classification and regression problems , the challenging of some known input
datasets are compared respectively by the proposed separation and smoothness indices. In the second
case study, the quality of dataflow is evaluated through layers of two pre-trained VGG 16 networks
in classification of Cifar10 and Cifar100. In the third case study, it is shown that the correct classification
rate and the separation index are almost equivalent through layers particularly while the serration
index is increased. In the last case study, two multi-layer neural networks, which are designed
for the prediction of Boston Housing price, are compared layer by layer by using the proposed smoothness
index.
