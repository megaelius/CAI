The truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) may be used to find the solution of the linear
discrete ill-posed problem $A x \approx b$ using Tikhonov regularization. Regularization parameter
$\alpha^2$ balances between the sizes of the fit to data functional $\|A x - b\|_2^2$ and the regularization
term $\| x\|_2^2$. Minimization of the unbiased predictive risk estimation (UPRE) function is
one suggested method to find $\alpha$ when the noise $\eta$ in the measurements $ b$ is assumed to
be normally distributed with white noise variance $\sigma^2$. We show that $\alpha_k$, the regularization
parameter for the solution obtained using the TSVD with $k$ terms, converges with $k$, when estimated
using the UPRE function. For the analysis it is sufficient to assume that the discrete Picard condition
is satisfied for exact data but that noise contaminates the measured data coefficients $s_i$ for
some $\ell$, $E(s^2_i)=\sigma^2$ for $i>\ell$, and that the problem is mildly, moderately or severely
ill-posed. The relevance of the noise assumptions in terms of the decay rate of the model is investigated
and provides a lower bound on $\alpha$ in terms of the noise level and the decay rate of the singular
values. Supporting results are contrasted with those obtained using the method of generalized
cross validation that is another often suggested method for estimating $\alpha$. An algorithm
to efficiently determine $\alpha_k$, which also finds the optimal $k$, is presented and simulations
for two-dimensional examples verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the algorithm
for increasing noise levels.
