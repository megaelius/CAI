Massive MIMO is a compelling wireless access concept that relies on the use of an excess number of
base-station antennas, relative to the number of active terminals. This technology is a main component
of 5G New Radio (NR) and addresses all important requirements of future wireless standards: a great
capacity increase, the support of many simultaneous users, and improvement in energy efficiency.
Massive MIMO requires the simultaneous processing of signals from many antenna chains, and computational
operations on large matrices. The complexity of the digital processing has been viewed as a fundamental
obstacle to the feasibility of Massive MIMO in the past. Recent advances on system-algorithm-hardware
co-design have led to extremely energy-efficient implementations. These exploit opportunities
in deeply-scaled silicon technologies and perform partly distributed processing to cope with
the bottlenecks encountered in the interconnection of many signals. For example, prototype ASIC
implementations have demonstrated zero-forcing precoding in real time at a 55 mW power consumption
(20 MHz bandwidth, 128 antennas, multiplexing of 8 terminals). Coarse and even error-prone digital
processing in the antenna paths permits a reduction of consumption with a factor of 2 to 5. This article
summarizes the fundamental technical contributions to efficient digital signal processing for
Massive MIMO. The opportunities and constraints on operating on low-complexity RF and analog hardware
chains are clarified. It illustrates how terminals can benefit from improved energy efficiency.
The status of technology and real-life prototypes discussed. Open challenges and directions for
future research are suggested.
