Physical-layer key generation methods utilize the variations of the communication channel to
achieve a secure key agreement between two parties with no prior security association. Their secrecy
rate (bit generation rate) depends heavily on the randomness of the channel, which may reduce significantly
in a stable environment. Existing methods seek to improve the secrecy rate by injecting artificial
noise into the channel. Unfortunately, noise injection cannot alter the underlying channel state,
which depends on the multipath environment between the transmitter and receiver. Consequently,
these methods are known to leak key bits toward multi-antenna eavesdroppers, which is capable of
filtering the noise through the differential of multiple signal receptions. This work demonstrates
an improved approach to reinforce physical-layer key generation schemes, e.g., channel randomization.
The channel randomization approach leverages a reconfigurable antenna to rapidly change the channel
state during transmission, and an angle-of-departure (AoD) based channel estimation algorithm
to cancel the changing effects for the intended receiver. The combined result is a communication
channel stable in the eyes of the intended receiver but randomly changing from the viewpoint of the
eavesdropper. We augmented an existing physical-layer key generation protocol, iJam, with the
proposed approach and developed a full-fledged remote instrumentation platform to demonstrate
its performance. Our evaluations show that augmentation does not affect the bit error rate (BER)
of the intended receiver during key establishment but reduces the eavesdropper's BER to the level
of random guessing, regardless of the number of antennas it equips.
