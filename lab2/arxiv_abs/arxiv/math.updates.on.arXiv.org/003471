Let $A = (A_1, \dots, A_m)$ be an $m$-tuple of self-adjoint elements of a unital $C$*-algebra ${\cal
A}$. The joint $q$-matricial range $W^q(A)$ is the set of $(B_1, \dots, B_m) \in M_q^m$ such that
$B_j = \Phi(A_j)$ for some unital completely positive linear map $\Phi: {\cal A} \rightarrow M_q$.
When ${\cal A}= B(H)$, where $B(H)$ is the algebra of bounded linear operators on the Hilbert space
$H$, the joint spatial $q$-matricial range $W^q_s(A)$ of $A$ is the set of $(B_1, \dots, B_m) \in
M_q^m$ such that $B_j$ is a compression of $A_j$ on a $q$-dimensional subspace. The joint essential
spatial $q$-matricial range is defined as $$W_{ess}^q(A) = \cap \{ {\bf cl}(W_s^q(A_1+K_1, \dots,
A_m+K_m)): K_1, \dots, K_m \hbox{ are compact operators}\},$$ where ${\bf cl}$ denotes the closure.
Suppose $K(H)$ is the set of compact operators in $B(H)$, and $\pi$ is the canonical surjection from
$B(H)$ to the Calkin algebra $B(H)/K(H)$. We prove that $W_{ess}^q(A)$ equals the joint $q$-matricial
range $W^q(\pi(A))$, where $\pi(A) = (\pi(A_1), \dots, \pi(A_m))$. Furthermore, for any positive
integer $N$, we prove that there are self-adjoint compact operators $K_1, \dots, K_m$ such that
$$W^q_s(A_1+K_1, \dots, A_m+K_m) = W^q_{ess}(A) \quad \hbox{ for all } q \in \{1, \dots, N\}.$$
If $W_{ess}^1(A) = W^1(\pi(A))$ is a simplex in ${\mathbb R}^m$, then we prove that there are self-adjoint
compact operators $K_1, \dots, K_m$ such that $W^q_s(A_1+K_1, \dots, A_m+K_m) = W^q_{ess}(A)$
for all positive integers $q$. These results generalize those of Narcowich-Ward and Smith-Ward,
obtained in the $m=2$ case, and also generalize the result of M\"{u}ller when $m \ge 1$ and $q = 1$.
