In this paper, we propose a sex-structured entomological model that serves as a basis for design
of control strategies relying on releases of sterile male mosquitoes (Aedes spp) and aiming at elimination
of the wild vector population in some target locality. We consider different types of releases (constant
and periodic impulsive), providing necessary conditions to reach elimination. However, the main
part of the paper is focused on the study of the periodic impulsive control in different situations.
When the size of wild mosquito population cannot be assessed in real time, we propose the so-called
open-loop control strategy that relies on periodic impulsive releases of sterile males with constant
release size. Under this control mode, global convergence towards the mosquito-free equilibrium
is proved on the grounds of sufficient condition that relates the size and frequency of releases.
If periodic assessments (either synchronized with releases or more sparse) of the wild population
size are available in real time, we propose the so-called closed-loop control strategy, which is
adjustable in accordance with reliable estimations of the wild population sizes. Under this control
mode, global convergence to the mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of another sufficient
condition that relates not only the size and frequency of periodic releases but also the frequency
of sparse measurements taken on wild populations. Finally, we propose a mixed control strategy
that combines open-loop and closed-loop strategies. This control mode renders the best result,
in terms of overall time needed to reach elimination and the number of releases to be effectively
carried out during the whole release campaign, while requiring for a reasonable amount of released
sterile insects.
