The problem of calculating the local and global decision thresholds in hard decisions based cooperative
spectrum sensing is well known for its mathematical intractability. Previous work relied on simple
suboptimal counting rules for decision fusion in order to avoid the exhaustive numerical search
required for obtaining the optimal thresholds. However, these simple rules are not globally optimal
as they do not maximize the overall global detection probability by jointly selecting local and
global thresholds. Instead, they maximize the detection probability for a specific global threshold.
In this paper, a globally optimal decision fusion rule for Primary User signal detection based on
the Neyman- Pearson (NP) criterion is derived. The algorithm is based on a novel representation
for the global performance metrics in terms of the regularized incomplete beta function. Based
on this mathematical representation, it is shown that the globally optimal NP hard decision fusion
test can be put in the form of a conventional one dimensional convex optimization problem. A binary
search for the global threshold can be applied yielding a complexity of O(log2(N)), where N represents
the number of cooperating users. The logarithmic complexity is appreciated because we are concerned
with dense networks, and thus N is expected to be large. The proposed optimal scheme outperforms
conventional counting rules, such as the OR, AND, and MAJORITY rules. It is shown via simulations
that, although the optimal rule tends to the simple OR rule when the number of cooperating secondary
users is small, it offers significant SNR gain in dense cognitive radio networks with large number
of cooperating users.
