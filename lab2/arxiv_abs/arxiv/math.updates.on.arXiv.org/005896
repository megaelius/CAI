We introduce a new metric homology theory, Moderately Discontinuous Homology, which captures
Lipschitz properties of metric subanalytic germs. The main novelty is to allow "moderately discontinuous"
chains, which are specially advantageous for capturing the subtleties of the outer metric phenomena.
Our invariant is a finitely generated graded abelian group $MDH^b_\bullet$ for any $b\in [1,\infty]$
and homomorphisms $MDH^b_\bullet\to MDH^{b'}_\bullet$ for any $b\geq b'$. Here $b$ is a "discontinuity
rate". The homology groups for the inner or outer metric are proved to be finitely generated and that
only finitely many homomorphisms $MDH^b_\bullet\to MDH^{b'}_\bullet$ are essential. For $b=1$
it recovers the homology of the tangent cone for the outer metric and of the Gromov tangent cone for
the inner one. In general, for $b=\infty$ the $MD$- homology recovers the homology of the punctured
germ. Hence, our invariant interpolates from the germ to its tangent cone. Our homology theory is
a bi-Lipschitz subanalitic invariant, is invariant by suitable metric homotopies, and satisfies
versions of the relative and Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequences. Moreover, fixed a discontinuity
rate $b$ we show that it is functorial for a class of discontinuous Lipschitz maps, whose discontinuities
are $b$-moderated; this makes the theory quite flexible. In the complex analytic setting we introduce
an enhancement called Framed MD Homology, which takes into account information from fundamental
classes. As applications we prove that Moderately Discontinuous Homology characterizes smooth
germs among all complex analytic germs, recovers the number of irreducible components of complex
analytic germs and the embedded topological type of plane branches. Framed MD Homology recovers
the topological type of any plane curve singularity and relative multiplicities of complex analytic
germs.
