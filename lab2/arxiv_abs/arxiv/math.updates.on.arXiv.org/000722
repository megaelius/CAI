We construct special rational ${\rm gl}_N$ Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard (KZB) equations
with $\tilde N$ punctures by deformation of the corresponding quantum ${\rm gl}_N$ rational $R$-matrix.
They have two parameters. The limit of the first one brings the model to the ordinary rational KZ equation.
Another one is $\tau$. At the level of classical mechanics the deformation parameter $\tau$ allows
to extend the previously obtained modified Gaudin models to the modified Schlesinger systems.
Next, we notice that the identities underlying generic (elliptic) KZB equations follow from some
additional relations for the properly normalized $R$-matrices. The relations are noncommutative
analogues of identities for (scalar) elliptic functions. The simplest one is the unitarity condition.
The quadratic (in $R$ matrices) relations are generated by noncommutative Fay identities. In particular,
one can derive the quantum Yang-Baxter equations from the Fay identities. The cubic relations provide
identities for the KZB equations as well as quadratic relations for the classical $r$-matrices
which can be treated as halves of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. At last we discuss the $R$-matrix
valued linear problems which provide ${\rm gl}_{\tilde N}$ CM models and Painleve equations via
the above mentioned identities. The role of the spectral parameter plays the Planck constant of
the quantum $R$-matrix. When the quantum ${\rm gl}_N$ $R$-matrix is scalar ($N=1$) the linear problem
reproduces the Krichever's ansatz for the Lax matrices with spectral parameter for the ${\rm gl}_{\tilde
N}$ CM models. The linear problems for the quantum CM models generalize the KZ equations in the same
way as the Lax pairs with spectral parameter generalizes those without it.
