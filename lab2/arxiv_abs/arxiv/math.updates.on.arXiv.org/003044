The data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is currently pushing the frontiers
of modeling and control efforts, and it provides a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of
model predictive control. However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks,
require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints
and symmetries, and often do not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These
factors limit the use of these techniques for the online identification of a model in the low-data
limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the
recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modeling procedure to include the
effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of model
predictive control (MPC), based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying
the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable, generalizable,
and reducing the burden of training data. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher
performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust
to noise than neural network models, making it viable for online training and execution in response
to rapid changes to the system. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven
models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC
is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic
Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating
drug treatment.
