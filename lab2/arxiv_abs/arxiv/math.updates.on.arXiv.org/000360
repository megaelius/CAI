The classical Remez inequality bounds the maximum of the absolute value of a real polynomial $P$
of degree $d$ on $[-1,1]$ through the maximum of its absolute value on any subset $Z\subset [-1,1]$
of positive Lebesgue measure. Extensions to several variables and to certain sets of Lebesgue measure
zero, massive in a much weaker sense, are available. Still, given a subset $Z\subset [-1,1]^n\subset
{\mathbb R}^n$ it is not easy to determine whether it is ${\mathcal P}_d({\mathbb R}^n)$-norming
(here ${\mathcal P}_d({\mathbb R}^n)$ is the space of real polynomials of degree at most $d$ on ${\mathbb
R}^n$), i.e. satisfies a Remez-type inequality: $\sup_{[-1,1]^n}|P|\le C\sup_{Z}|P|$ for all
$P\in {\mathcal P}_d({\mathbb R}^n)$ with $C$ independent of $P$. (Although ${\mathcal P}_d({\mathbb
R}^n)$-norming sets are exactly those not contained in any algebraic hypersurface of degree $d$
in ${\mathbb R}^n$, there are many apparently unrelated reasons for $Z \subset [-1,1]^n$ to have
this property.) In the present paper we study norming sets and related Remez-type inequalities
in a general setting of finite-dimensional linear spaces $V$ of continuous functions on $[-1,1]^n$,
remaining in most of the examples in the classical framework. First, we discuss some sufficient
conditions for $Z$ to be $V$-norming, partly known, partly new, restricting ourselves to the simplest
non-trivial examples. Next, we extend the Turan-Nazarov inequality for exponential polynomials
to several variables, and on this base prove a new fewnomial Remez-type inequality. Finally, we
study the family of optimal constants $N_{V}(Z)$ in the Remez-type inequalities for $V$, as the
function of the set $Z$, showing that it is Lipschitz in the Hausdorff metric.
