This thesis splits into two major parts. The connection between the two parts is the notion of "categorification"
which we shortly explain/recall in the introduction. In the first part of this thesis we extend Bar-Natan's
cobordism based categorification of the Jones polynomial to virtual links. Our topological complex
allows a direct extension of the classical Khovanov complex (h=t=0), the variant of Lee (h=0,t=1)
and other classical link homologies. We show that our construction allows, over rings of characteristic
2, extensions with no classical analogon, e.g. Bar-Natan's Z/2Z-link homology can be extended
in two non-equivalent ways. Our construction is computable in the sense that one can write a computer
program to perform calculations, e.g. we have written a MATHEMATICA based program. Moreover, we
give a classification of all unoriented TQFTs which can be used to define virtual link homologies
from our topological construction. Furthermore, we prove that our extension is combinatorial
and has semi-local properties. We use the semi-local properties to prove an application, i.e. we
give a discussion of Lee's degeneration of virtual homology. In the second part of this thesis (which
is based on joint work with Mackaay and Pan) we use Kuperberg's sl3 webs and Khovanov's sl3 foams to
define a new algebra K_S, which we call the sl3 web algebra. It is the sl3 analogue of Khovanov's arc
algebra H_n. We prove that K_S is a graded symmetric Frobenius algebra. Furthermore, we categorify
an instance of q-skew Howe duality, which allows us to prove that K_S is Morita equivalent to a certain
cyclotomic KLR-algebra. This allows us to determine the split Grothendieck group K_0(K_S), to
show that its center is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a certain Spaltenstein variety, and
to prove that K_S is a graded cellular algebra.
