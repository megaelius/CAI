Many dynamical systems arising in biology and other areas exhibit multistationarity (two or more
positive steady states with the same conserved quantities). Although deciding multistationarity
for a polynomial dynamical system is an effective question in real algebraic geometry, it is in general
difficult to determine whether a given network can give rise to a multistationary system, and if
so, to identify witnesses to multistationarity, that is, specific parameter values for which the
system exhibits multiple steady states. Here we investigate both problems. First, we build on work
of Conradi, Feliu, Mincheva, and Wiuf, who showed that for certain reaction networks whose steady
states admit a positive parametrization, multistationarity is characterized by whether a certain
"critical function" changes sign. Here, we allow for more general parametrizations, which make
it much easier to determine the existence of a sign change. This is particularly simple when the steady-state
equations are linearly equivalent to binomials; we give necessary conditions for this to happen,
which hold for many networks studied in the literature. We also give a sufficient condition for multistationarity
of networks whose steady-state equations can be replaced by equivalent triangular-form equations.
Finally, we present methods for finding witnesses to multistationarity, which we show work well
for certain structured reaction networks, including those common to biological signaling pathways.
Our work relies on results from degree theory, on the existence of explicit rational parametrizations
of the steady states, and on the specialization of Groebner bases.
