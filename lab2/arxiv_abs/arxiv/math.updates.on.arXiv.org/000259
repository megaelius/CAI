In this paper, we consider secure transmissions in ergodic Rayleigh fast-faded multiple-input
multiple-output multiple-antenna-eavesdropper (MIMOME) wiretap channels with only statistical
channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). When the legitimate receiver has more (or
equal) antennas than the eavesdropper, we prove the first MIMOME secrecy capacity with partial
CSIT by establishing a new secrecy capacity upper-bound. The key step is to form an MIMOME degraded
channel by dividing the legitimate receiver's channel matrix into two submatrices, and setting
one of the submatrices to be the same as the eavesdropper's channel matrix. Next, under the total
power constraint over all transmit antennas, we analytically solve the channel-input covariance
matrix optimization problem to fully characterize the MIMOME secrecy capacity. Typically, the
MIMOME optimization problems are non-concave. However, thank to the proposed degraded channel,
we can transform the stochastic MIMOME optimization problem to be a Schur-concave one and then find
its solution. Besides total power constraint, we also investigate the secrecy capacity when the
transmitter is subject to the practical per-antenna power constraint. The corresponding optimization
problem is even more difficult since it is not Schuar-concave. Under the two power constraints considered,
the corresponding MIMOME secrecy capacities can both scale with the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)
when the difference between numbers of antennas at legitimate receiver and eavesdropper are large
enough. However, when the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper have a single antenna each, such
SNR scalings do not exist for both cases.
