In this paper, we focus on developing simple scheduling policies that can minimize the age of the
information sent through multi-server queueing systems. We consider a general packet arrival
process, where the generation times and arrival times of the packets are arbitrary. Hence, the packets
may arrive in an order that is different from the order of their generation times. Further, a packet
can be replicated on multiple servers, and one can specify a priori the maximum number of replicas
that can be created for each packet. Once a replica is completed, the remaining replicas of this packet
are canceled to release the servers. We prove that simple variants (e.g., preemptive, replicative,
non-replicative) of the Last-Generated, First-Serve (LGFS) scheduling policy are age-optimal
in a stochastic ordering sense for exponentially distributed packet service times. These policies
are optimal for minimizing not only the age process, but also for minimizing any non-decreasing
functional of the age process. We further investigate the class of New-Better-than-Used (NBU)
service time distributions and develop scheduling policies that are shown to be within a constant
gap from the optimum age performance. It is known that replication worsens the delay and decreases
the throughput for most NBU service time distributions. However, to our surprise, we find that replication
can in fact reduce the age for a variety of NBU service time distributions. Our results further imply
that the variants of Last-Come, First-Serve (LCFS) scheduling policies are (near) age-optimal,
because they are special cases of the proposed LGFS-type policies.
