We solve the regularity problem for Milnor's infinite dimensional Lie groups in the strictly continuous
setting ($C^0$-topology); and provide necessary and sufficient regularity conditions for the
standard case ($C^k$-topology). We show that the evolution map is strictly continuous on its domain
$\textit{iff}\hspace{1pt}$ the Lie group $G$ is locally $\mu$-convex. We furthermore prove that
if the evolution map is defined on all smooth curves, then $G$ is Mackey-complete - This is a completeness
condition formulated in terms of the Lie group operations that generalizes Mackey-completeness
as defined for locally convex vector spaces. Then, under the presumption that $G$ is locally $\mu$-convex,
we show that each $C^k$-curve, for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}\sqcup\{\mathrm{lip},\infty\}$
fixed, is integrable (contained in the domain of the evolution map) $\textit{iff}\hspace{1pt}$
$G$ is Mackey-complete and $\mathrm{k}$-confined. The latter condition states that each $C^k$-curve
in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ can be uniformly approximated by a special type of sequence,
consisting of piecewise integrable curves: A similar result is proven for the case $k= 0$; and we
provide several mild conditions that ensure that $G$ is even $\mathrm{lip}$-confined. We finally
discuss differentiation of parameter-dependent integrals in the standard setting ($C^k$-topology).
In particular, we show that if the evolution map is well defined and continuous on $C^k([0,1],\mathfrak{g})$
for $k\in \mathbb{N}\sqcup\{\infty\}$, then it is smooth thereon $\textit{iff}\hspace{1pt}$
$\mathfrak{g}$ is $\hspace{0.2pt}$ Mackey-complete for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}\sqcup\{\infty\}$
$\hspace{1pt}/\hspace{1pt}$ integral complete for $k=0$. This result is achieved by calculating
the directional derivatives explicitly: Recovering the standard formulas (Duhamel) that hold,
e.g., in the Banach (finite dimensional) case.
