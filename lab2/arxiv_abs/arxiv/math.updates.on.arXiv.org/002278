This work focuses on a class of elliptic boundary value problems with diffusive, advective and reactive
terms, motivated by the study of three-dimensional heterogeneous physical systems composed of
two or more media separated by a selective interface. We propose a novel approach for the numerical
approximation of such heterogeneous systems combining, for the first time: (1) a dual mixed hybrid
(DMH) finite element method (FEM) based on the lowest order Raviart-Thomas space (RT0); (2) a Three-Field
(3F) formulation; and (3) a Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization method.
Using the abstract theory for generalized saddle-point problems and their approximation, we show
that the weak formulation of the proposed method and its numerical counterpart are both uniquely
solvable and that the resulting finite element scheme enjoys optimal convergence properties with
respect to the discretization parameter. In addition, an efficient implementation of the proposed
formulation is presented. The implementation is based on a systematic use of static condensation
which reduces the method to a nonconforming finite element approach on a grid made by three-dimensional
simplices. Extensive computational tests demonstrate the theoretical conclusions and indicate
that the proposed DMH-RT0 FEM scheme is accurate and stable even in the presence of marked interface
jump discontinuities in the solution and its associated normal flux. Results also show that in the
case of strongly dominating advective terms, the proposed method with the SUPG stabilization is
capable of resolving accurately steep boundary and/or interior layers without introducing spurious
unphysical oscillations or excessive smearing of the solution front.
