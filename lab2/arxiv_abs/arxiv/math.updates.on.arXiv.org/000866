By a theorem of Gordon and Hedenmalm, $\varphi$ generates a bounded composition operator on the
Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}^2$ of Dirichlet series $\sum_n b_n n^{-s}$ with square-summable coefficients
$b_n$ if and only if $\varphi(s)=c_0 s+\psi(s)$, where $c_0$ is a nonnegative integer and $\psi$
a Dirichlet series with the following mapping properties: $\psi$ maps the right half-plane into
the half-plane $\operatorname{Re} s >1/2$ if $c_0=0$ and is either identically zero or maps
the right half-plane into itself if $c_0$ is positive. It is shown that the $n$th approximation numbers
of bounded composition operators on $\mathscr{H}^2$ are bounded below by a constant times $r^n$
for some $0<r<1$ when $c_0=0$ and bounded below by a constant times $n^{-A}$ for some $A>0$
when $c_0$ is positive. Both results are best possible. The case when $c_0=0$, $\psi$ is bounded
and smooth up to the boundary of the right half-plane, and $\sup \operatorname{Re} \psi=1/2$, is
discussed in depth; it includes examples of non-compact operators as well as operators belonging
to all Schatten classes $S_p$. For $\varphi(s)=c_1+\sum_{j=1}^d c_{q_j} q_j^{-s}$ with $q_j$
independent integers, it is shown that the $n$th approximation number behaves as $n^{-(d-1)/2}$,
possibly up to a factor $(\log n)^{(d-1)/2}$. Estimates rely mainly on a general Hilbert space method
involving finite linear combinations of reproducing kernels. A key role is played by a recently
developed interpolation method for $\mathscr{H}^2$ using estimates of solutions of the $\bar{\partial}$
equation. Finally, by a transference principle from $H^2$ of the unit disc, explicit examples of
compact composition operators with approximation numbers decaying at essentially any sub-exponential
rate can be displayed.
