A Lie conformal algebra is an algebraic structure that encodes the singular part of the operator
product expansion of chiral fields in conformal field theory. A Lie pseudoalgebra is a generalization
of this structure, for which the algebra of polynomials k[\partial] in the indeterminate is replaced
by the universal enveloping algebra U(d) of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra d over the base field
k. The finite (i.e., finitely generated over U(d)) simple Lie pseudoalgebras were classified in
our 2001 paper [BDK]. The complete list consists of primitive Lie pseudoalgebras of type W, S, H,
and K, and of current Lie pseudoalgebras over them or over simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
The present paper is the third in our series on representation theory of simple Lie pseudoalgebras.
In the first paper, we showed that any finite irreducible module over a primitive Lie pseudoalgebra
of type W or S is either an irreducible tensor module or the image of the differential in a member of
the pseudo de Rham complex. In the second paper, we established a similar result for primitive Lie
pseudoalgebras of type K, with the pseudo de Rham complex replaced by a certain reduction, called
the contact pseudo de Rham complex. This reduction in the context of contact geometry was discovered
by M. Rumin [Rum]. In the present paper, we show that for primitive Lie pseudoalgebras of type H, a
similar to type K result holds with the contact pseudo de Rham complex replaced by a suitable complex.
However, the type H case in more involved, since the annihilation algebra is not the corresponding
Lie-Cartan algebra, as in other cases, but an irreducible central extension. When the action of
the center of the annihilation algebra is trivial, this complex is related to work by M. Eastwood
[E] on conformally symplectic geometry, and we call it conformally symplectic pseudo de Rham complex.
