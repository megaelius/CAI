This work deals with the modeling of nonsmooth vibro-impact motion of a continuous structure against
a rigid distributed obstacle. Galerkin's approach is used to approximate the solutions of the governing
partial differential equations of the structure, which results in a system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). When these ODEs are subjected to unilateral constraints and velocity jump conditions,
one must use an event detection algorithm to calculate the time of impact accurately. Event detection
in the presence of multiple simultaneous impacts is a computationally demanding task. Ivanov proposed
a nonsmooth transformation for a vibro-impacting multi-degree-of-freedom system subjected
to a single unilateral constraint. This transformation eliminates the unilateral constraints
from the problem and, therefore, no event detection is required during numerical integration.
Ivanov used his transformation to make analytical calculations for the stability and bifurcations
of vibro-impacting motions; however, he did not explore its application for simulating distributed
collisions in spatially continuous structures. We adopt Ivanov's transformation to deal with
multiple unilateral constraints in spatially continuous structures. Also, imposing the velocity
jump conditions exactly in the modal coordinates is nontrivial and challenging. Therefore, in
this work we use a modal-physical transformation to convert the system from modal to physical coordinates
on a spatially discretized grid. We then apply Ivanov's transformation on the physical system to
simulate the vibro-impact motion of the structure. The developed method is demonstrated by modeling
the distributed collision of a nonlinear string against a rigid distributed surface. For validation,
we compare our results with the well-known penalty approach.
