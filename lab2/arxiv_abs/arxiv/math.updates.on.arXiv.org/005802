Flash memory devices are winning the competition for storage density against magnetic recording
devices. This outcome results from advances in physics that allow storage of more than one bit per
cell, coupled with advances in signal processing that reduce the effect of physical instabilities.
Constrained codes are used in storage to avoid problematic patterns. Recently, we introduced binary
symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes) for data storage and data
transmission. This paper introduces simple constrained codes that support non-binary physical
substrates; multi, triple, quad, and the currently-in-development penta-level cell (M/T/Q/P-LC)
Flash memories. The new codes can be easily modified if problematic patterns change with time. These
codes are designed to mitigate inter-cell interference, which is a critical source of error in Flash
devices. The occurrence of errors is a consequence of parasitic capacitances in and across floating
gate transistors, resulting in charge propagation from cells being programmed to the highest charge
level to neighboring cells being programmed to lower levels. The new codes are called $q$-ary asymmetric
LOCO codes (QA-LOCO codes), and the construction subsumes codes previously designed for single-level
cell (SLC) Flash devices (A-LOCO codes). QA-LOCO codes work for a Flash device with any number, $q$,
of levels per cell. For $q \geq 4$, we show that QA-LOCO codes can achieve rates greater than $0.95
\log_2 q$ information bits per coded symbol. The complexity of encoding and decoding is modest,
and reconfiguring a code is as easy as reprogramming an adder. Capacity-achieving rates, affordable
encoding-decoding complexity, and ease of reconfigurability support the growing development
of M/T/Q/P-LC Flash memory devices, as well as lifecycle management as the characteristics of these
devices change with time.
