We consider the action of a finite subgroup of the mapping class group $Mod(S)$ of an oriented compact
surface $S$ of genus $g \geq 2$ on the moduli space $\mathcal{R}(S,G)$ of representations of $\pi_1(S)$
in a connected semisimple real Lie group $G$. Kerckhoff's solution of the Nielsen realization problem
ensures the existence of an element $J$ in the Teichm\"uller space of $S$ for which $\Gamma$ can be
realised as a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of $X=(S,J)$ which are holomorphic or antiholomorphic.
We identify the fixed points of the action of $\Gamma$ on $\mathcal{R}(S,G)$ in terms of $G$-Higgs
bundles on $X$ equipped with a certain twisted $\Gamma$-equivariant structure, where the twisting
involves abelian and non-abelian group cohomology simultaneously. When the kernel of the isotropy
representation of the maximal compact subgroup of $G$ is trivial, the fixed points can be described
in terms of familiar objects on $Y=X/\Gamma^+$, where $\Gamma^+ \subset \Gamma$ is the maximal
subgroup of $\Gamma$ consisting of holomorphic automorphisms of $X$. If $\Gamma=\Gamma^+$ one
obtains actual $\Gamma$-equivariant $G$-Higgs bundles on $X$, which in turn correspond with parabolic
Higgs bundles on $Y=X/\Gamma$ (this generalizes work of Nasatyr \& Steer for $G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})$
and Boden, Andersen & Grove and Furuta & Steer for $G=SU(n)$). If on the other hand $\Gamma$ has antiholomorphic
automorphisms, the objects on $Y=X/\Gamma^+$ correspond with pseudoreal parabolic Higgs bundles.
This is a generalization in the parabolic setup of the pseudoreal Higgs bundles studied by the first
author in collaboration with Biswas & Hurtubise.
