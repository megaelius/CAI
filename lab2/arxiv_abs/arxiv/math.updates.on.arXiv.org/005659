On a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)$ we consider two independent sequences
$(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ and $(b_k)_{k \geq 1}$ of i.i.d. random variables that are centered with unit
variance and which admit a moment strictly higher than two. We define the associated random trigonometric
polynomial \[ f_n(t) :=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k \cos(kt)+b_k \sin(kt), \quad t \in
\mathbb R. \] In their seminal work, for Rademacher coefficients, Salem and Zygmund showed that
$\mathbb P$ almost surely: \[ \forall t\in\mathbb R,\quad \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi} \exp\left(i
t f_n(x)\right) dx \xrightarrow[n\to\infty]~e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}. \] In other words, if $X$ denotes
an independent random variable uniformly distributed on $[0,2\pi]$, $\mathbb{P}$ almost surely,
under the law of $X$, $f_n(X)$ converges in distribution to a standard Gaussian variable. In this
paper, we revisit the above result from different perspectives. Namely, i) we establish a possibly
sharp convergence rate for some adequate metric via the Stein's method, ii) we prove a functional
counterpart of Salem--Zygmund CLT, iii) we extend it to more general distributions for $X$, iv)
we also prove that the convergence actually holds in total variation. As an application, in the case
where the random coefficients have a symmetric distribution and admit a moment of order $4$, we show
that $\mathbb{P}$ almost surely, for any interval $[a,b] \subset [0, 2\pi]$ \[\frac{\mathcal
N(f_n,[a,b])}{n} \xrightarrow[n \to +\infty]{} \frac{(b-a)}{\pi \sqrt{3}},\] where $\mathcal
N(f_n,[a,b])$ denotes the number of real zeros of $f_n$ in the interval $[a,b]$. To the best of our
knowledge, such an almost sure result is new in the framework of random trigonometric polynomials,
even in the case of Gaussian coefficients.
