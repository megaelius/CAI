We demonstrate that the algorithmic information content of a system is deeply connected to its potential
dynamics, thus affording an avenue for moving systems in the information-theoretic space and controlling
them in the phase space. To this end we performed experiments and validated the results on (1) a very
large set of small graphs, (2) a number of larger networks with different topologies, and (3) biological
networks from a widely studied and validated genetic network (e.coli) as well as on a significant
number of differentiating (Th17) and differentiated human cells from high quality databases (Harvard's
CellNet) with results conforming to experimentally validated biological data. Based on these
results we introduce a conceptual framework, a model-based interventional calculus and a reprogrammability
measure with which to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics of non- linear dynamical
systems from partial and disordered observations. The method consists in finding and applying
a series of controlled interventions to a dynamical system to estimate how its algorithmic information
content is affected when every one of its elements are perturbed. The approach represents an alternative
to numerical simulation and statistical approaches for inferring causal mechanistic/generative
models and finding first principles. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities by reconstructing
the phase space of some discrete dynamical systems (cellular automata) as case study and reconstructing
their generating rules. We thus advance tools for reprogramming artificial and living systems
without full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic equations or probability distributions
yielding a suite of universal and parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability ranging from
causation, dimension reduction, feature selection and model generation.
