We present a novel family of $C^1$ quadrilateral finite elements, which define global $C^1$ spaces
over a general quadrilateral mesh with vertices of arbitrary valency. The elements extend the construction
by (Brenner and Sung, J. Sci. Comput., 2005), which is based on polynomial elements of tensor-product
degree $p\geq 6$, to all degrees $p \geq 3$. Thus, we call the family of $C^1$ finite elements Brenner-Sung
quadrilaterals. The proposed $C^1$ quadrilateral can be seen as a special case of the Argyris isogeometric
element of (Kapl, Sangalli and Takacs, CAGD, 2019). The quadrilateral elements possess similar
degrees of freedom as the classical Argyris triangles. Just as for the Argyris triangle, we additionally
impose $C^2$ continuity at the vertices. In this paper we focus on the lower degree cases, that may
be desirable for their lower computational cost and better conditioning of the basis: We consider
indeed the polynomial quadrilateral of (bi-)degree~$5$, and the polynomial degrees $p=3$ and
$p=4$ by employing a splitting into $3\times3$ or $2\times2$ polynomial pieces, respectively.
The proposed elements reproduce polynomials of total degree $p$. We show that the space provides
optimal approximation order. Due to the interpolation properties, the error bounds are local on
each element. In addition, we describe the construction of a simple, local basis and give for $p\in\{3,4,5\}$
explicit formulas for the B\'{e}zier or B-spline coefficients of the basis functions. Numerical
experiments by solving the biharmonic equation demonstrate the potential of the proposed $C^1$
quadrilateral finite element for the numerical analysis of fourth order problems, also indicating
that (for $p=5$) the proposed element performs comparable or in general even better than the Argyris
triangle with respect to the number of degrees of freedom.
