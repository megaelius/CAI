We consider first order gravity in four dimensions. In particular, we consider formulations where
the fundamental variables are a tetrad $e$ and a SO(3,1) connection $\omega$. We study the most general
action principle compatible with diffeomorphism invariance. This implies, in particular, considering
besides the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Palatini term, other terms that either do not change the
equations of motion, or are topological in nature. Having a well defined action principle also implies
adding additional boundary terms, whose detailed form may depend on the particular boundary conditions
at hand. We consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying asymptotically
flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying isolated horizons boundary conditions.
For our analysis we employ the covariant Hamiltonian formalism where the phase space $\Gamma$ is
given by solutions to the equation of motion. For each of the possible terms contributing to the action
we study the well posedness of the action, its finiteness, the contribution to the symplectic structure,
and the Hamiltonian and Noether charges. We show that for the chosen boundary conditions, standard
boundary terms warrant a well posed theory. Furthermore, we show that the boundary and topological
terms do not contribute to the symplectic structure, nor the Hamiltonian conserved charges. The
Noether conserved charges, on the other hand, do depend on such additional terms. The aim of the paper
is to present a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of the subject, so the style is somewhat
pedagogical. Furthermore, we point out and clarify some issues that have not been clearly understood
in the literature.
