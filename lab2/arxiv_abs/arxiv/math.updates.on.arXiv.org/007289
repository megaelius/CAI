We define a new family of graph invariants, studying the topology of the moduli space of their geometric
realizations in Euclidean spaces, using a limiting procedure reminiscent of Floer homology. Given
a labeled graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $d \geq 1$, $W_{G, d} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ denotes
the space of nondegenerate realizations of $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$.The set $W_{G, d}$ might not be
connected, even when it is nonempty, and we refer to its connected components as rigid isotopy classes
of $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We study the topology of these rigid isotopy classes. First, regarding
the connectivity of $W_{G, d}$, we generalize a result of Maehara that $W_{G, d}$ is nonempty for
$d \geq n$ to show that $W_{G, d}$ is $k$-connected for $d \geq n + k + 1$, and so $W_{G, \infty}$ is always
contractible. While $\pi_k(W_{G, d}) = 0$ for $G$, $k$ fixed and $d$ large enough, we also prove that,
in spite of this, when $d\to \infty$ the structure of the nonvanishing homology of $W_{G, d}$ exhibits
a stabilization phenomenon: it consists of $(n-1)$ equally spaced clusters whose shape does not
depend on $d$, for $d$ large enough. This leads to the definition of a family of graph invariants,
capturing this structure. For instance, the sum of the Betti numbers of $W_{G,d}$ does not depend
on $d$, for $d$ large enough; we call this number the Floer number of the graph $G$. Finally, we give
asymptotic estimates on the number of rigid isotopy classes of $\mathbb{R}^d$--geometric graphs
on $n$ vertices for $d$ fixed and $n$ tending to infinity. When $d=1$ we show that asymptotically
as $n\to \infty$ each isomorphism class corresponds to a constant number of rigid isotopy classes,
on average. For $d>1$ we prove a similar statement at the logarithmic scale.
