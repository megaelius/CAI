Let $F = (f,g): \C^2 \to \C^2$ be a polynomial map. The 2-dimensional Complex Jacobian Conjecture,
which is still open, can be expressed as follows: "if $F$ satisfies the Non-Zero Condition $\det
(JF(x,y)) = {\rm constant} \neq 0, \forall (x,y) \in \C^2$, then $F$ is non-proper". A significant
approach for the study of the Jacobian Conjecture is to remove the most possible polynomial maps
that do not satisfy the Non-Zero Condition and work on the complementary set in the ring of polynomial
maps. We define firstly in this paper good polynomial maps which satisfy the following property:
if $F$ satisfies the Non-Zero Condition, then $F$ is a good polynomial map. Then, with the hypothesis
"$F$ is non-proper", we define new variables called pertinent variables and we treat $F$ under these
variables. That allows us to define a class $\mathcal{C}_1$ of good, non-proper polynomial maps
$F = (f,g): \C^2 \to \C^2$ that are significant for the study of the Jacobian Conjecture. We continue
to restrict the class $\mathcal{C}_1$ by expliciting a subclass $\mathcal{C}_2 \subset \mathcal{C}_1$
of polynomial maps which do not satisfy the Non-Zero Condition. Then, on the one side, we get a model
of a counter-example for the Conjecture if there exists. On the other side, we provide a criterion
for verifying the 2-dimensional Complex Jacobian Conjecture for the class of good, non-proper
maps. Moreover, for verifying the 2-dimensional Complex Jacobian Conjecture, it is enough to verify
it for the complementary set of the set $ {\mathcal C}_2$ in the set of good maps. The second part of
this paper is to provide a criterion to verify the dominancy of a polynomial map in general. Applying
this criterion, we prove that a polynomial map of the class $\mathcal{C}_1 \setminus \mathcal{C}_2$
is dominant and we describe its asymptotic set.
