Numerous multi-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithms have been designed for solving
constrained optimisation problems in last two decades. Their idea is to transform a constrained
optimisation problem into a multi-objective optimisation problem without inequality and equality
constraints and then to apply a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm into solving it. This paper
investigates the helper and equivalent objective method for constrained optimisation, in which
one objective is equivalent to solving the original constrained problem and other objectives play
a helper role. Several new contributions are made in this paper. First, the helper and equivalent
objective method is analysed in a rigorous way. It is proven that using helper and equivalent objectives
may shorten the expected hitting time of a multi-objective algorithm leaving a local optimum with
respect to a single objective algorithm. Secondly, in order to reduce the preference of feasible
solutions over infeasible ones, a new equivalent objective function is constructed. Then the multi-objective
problem consisting of helper and equivalent objectives is decomposed into several single objective
problems using the weighted sum approach. Weights are dynamically adjusted so that each single
objective eventually tends to an equivalent objective. At the end, a new multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm is designed for constrained optimisation. This algorithm is run on benchmarks in IEEE
CEC 2017 and 2018 constrained optimisation competitions. Comparative experiment shows that the
proposed algorithm is capable of producing dominating results compared with all algorithms participated
in the two competitions.
