We consider an optimal transport problem on the unit simplex whose solutions are given by gradients
of exponentially concave functions and prove two main results. First, we show that the optimal transport
is the large deviation limit of a particle system of Dirichlet processes transporting one probability
measure on the unit simplex to another by coordinatewise multiplication and normalizing. The structure
of our Lagrangian and the appearance of the Dirichlet process relate our problem closely to the entropic
measure on the Wasserstein space as defined by von-Renesse and Sturm in the context of Wasserstein
diffusion. The limiting procedure is a triangular limit where we allow simultaneously the number
of particles to grow to infinity while the `noise' tends to zero. The method, which generalizes easily
to many other cost functions, including the squared Euclidean distance, provides a novel combination
of the Schr\"odinger problem approach due to C. L\'eonard and the related Brownian particle systems
by Adams et al.which does not require gamma convergence. Second, we analyze the behavior of entropy
along the paths of transport. The reference measure on the simplex is taken to be the Dirichlet measure
with all zero parameters which relates to the finite-dimensional distributions of the entropic
measure. The interpolating curves are not the usual McCann lines. Nevertheless we show that entropy
plus a multiple of the transport cost remains convex, which is reminiscent of the semiconvexity
of entropy along lines of McCann interpolations in negative curvature spaces. We also obtain, under
suitable conditions, dimension-free bounds of the optimal transport cost in terms of entropy.
