Biological systems with intertwined feedback loops pose a challenge to mathematical modeling
efforts. Moreover, rare events, such as mutation and extinction, complicate system dynamics.
Stochastic simulation algorithms are useful in generating time-evolution trajectories for these
systems because they can adequately capture the influence of random fluctuations and quantify
rare events. We present a simple and flexible package, BioSimulator.jl, for implementing the Gillespie
algorithm, $\tau$-leaping, and related stochastic simulation algorithms. The objective of this
work is to provide scientists across domains with fast, user-friendly simulation tools. We used
the high-performance programming language Julia because of its emphasis on scientific computing.
Our software package implements a suite of stochastic simulation algorithms based on Markov chain
theory. We provide the ability to (a) diagram Petri Nets describing interactions, (b) plot average
trajectories and attached standard deviations of each participating species over time, and (c)
generate frequency distributions of each species at a specified time. BioSimulator.jl's interface
allows users to build models programmatically within Julia. A model is then passed to the simulate
routine to generate simulation data. The built-in tools allow one to visualize results and compute
summary statistics. Our examples highlight the broad applicability of our software to systems
of varying complexity from ecology, systems biology, chemistry, and genetics. The user-friendly
nature of BioSimulator.jl encourages the use of stochastic simulation, minimizes tedious programming
efforts, and reduces errors during model specification.
