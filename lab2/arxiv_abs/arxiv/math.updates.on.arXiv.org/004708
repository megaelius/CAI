This paper introduces a systematic approach towards the inverse problem for arboreal Galois representations
of finite index attached to quadratic polynomials. Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $\neq 2$,
$f\in F[x]$ be monic and quadratic and $\rho_f$ be the arboreal Galois representation associated
to $f$, taking values in the group $\Omega_{\infty}$ of automorphisms of the infinite binary tree.
We give a complete description of the maximal closed subgroups of each closed subgroup of index at
most two of $\Omega_{\infty}$ in terms of linear relations modulo squares among certain universal
functions evaluated in elements of the critical orbit of $f$. We use such description in order to
derive necessary and sufficient criteria for the image of $\rho_f$ to be a given subgroup of index
two of $\Omega_\infty$. These depend exclusively on the arithmetic of the critical orbit of $f$.
Afterwards, we prove that if $\phi=x^2+t\in\mathbb Q(t)[x]$, then there exist exactly five distinct
subgroups of index two of $\Omega_{\infty}$ that can appear as images of $\rho_{\phi_{t_0}}$ for
infinitely many $t_0\in\mathbb Q$, where $\phi_{t_0}$ is the specialized polynomial. We show
that two of them appear infinitely often, and if Vojta's conjecture over $\mathbb Q$ holds true,
then so do the remaining ones. Finally, we give an explicit description of the descending central
series of each subgroup of index two. Using this, we introduce a sequence of combinatorial invariants
for subgroups of index two of $\Omega_\infty$. With a delicate use of these invariants we are able
to establish that such subgroups are pairwise non-isomorphic as topological groups, a result of
independent interest. This implies, in particular, that the five aforementioned groups are pairwise
distinct topological groups, and therefore yield five genuinely different instances of the infinite
inverse Galois problem over $\mathbb Q$.
