Quantile regression (QR) is a principal regression method for analyzing the impact of covariates
on outcomes. The impact is described by the conditional quantile function and its functionals.
In this paper we develop the nonparametric QR-series framework, covering many regressors as a special
case, for performing inference on the entire conditional quantile function and its linear functionals.
In this framework, we approximate the entire conditional quantile function by a linear combination
of series terms with quantile-specific coefficients and estimate the function-valued coefficients
from the data. We develop large sample theory for the QR-series coefficient process, namely we obtain
uniform strong approximations to the QR-series coefficient process by conditionally pivotal
and Gaussian processes. Based on these strong approximations, or couplings, we develop four resampling
methods (pivotal, gradient bootstrap, Gaussian, and weighted bootstrap) that can be used for inference
on the entire QR-series coefficient function. We apply these results to obtain estimation and inference
methods for linear functionals of the conditional quantile function, such as the conditional quantile
function itself, its partial derivatives, average partial derivatives, and conditional average
partial derivatives. Specifically, we obtain uniform rates of convergence and show how to use the
four resampling methods mentioned above for inference on the functionals. All of the above results
are for function-valued parameters, holding uniformly in both the quantile index and the covariate
value, and covering the pointwise case as a by-product. We demonstrate the practical utility of
these results with an example, where we estimate the price elasticity function and test the Slutsky
condition of the individual demand for gasoline, as indexed by the individual unobserved propensity
for gasoline consumption.
