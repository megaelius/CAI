The optimal transport problem has recently developed into a powerful framework for various applications
in estimation and control. Many of the recent advances in the theory and application of optimal transport
are based on regularizing the problem with an entropy term, which connects it to the Schr\"odinger
bridge problem and thus to stochastic optimal control. Moreover, the entropy regularization makes
the otherwise computationally demanding optimal transport problem feasible even for large scale
settings. This has lead to an accelerated development of optimal transport based methods in a broad
range of fields. Many of these applications have a underlying graph structure, for instance information
fusion and tracking problems can be described by trees. In this work we consider multi-marginal
optimal transport problems with a cost function that decouples according to a tree structure. The
entropy regularized multi-marginal optimal transport problem can be viewed as a generalization
of the Schr\"odinger bridge problem on the same tree, and by utilizing these connections we extend
the computational methods for the classical optimal transport problem in order to solve structured
multi-marginal optimal transport problems in an efficient manner. In particular, the algorithm
requires only matrix-vector multiplications of relatively small dimensions. We show that the
multi-marginal regularization introduces less diffusion, compared to the commonly used pairwise
regularization, and is therefore more suitable for many applications. Numerical examples illustrate
this, and we finally apply the proposed framework for tracking of an ensemble of indistinguishable
agents.
