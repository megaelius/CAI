We study the dynamical behavior of a one dimensional interface interacting with a sticky unpenetrable
substrate or wall. The interface is subject to two effects going in opposite directions. Contact
between the interface and the substrate are given an energetic bonus while an external force with
constant intensity pulls the interface away from the wall. Our interface is modeled by the graph
of a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor path on $\mathbb{Z}_+$, starting at $0$ and ending at $0$
after $2N$ steps, the wall corresponding to level-zero the horizontal axis. At equilibrium each
path $\xi=(\xi_x)_{x=0}^{2N}$, is given a probability proportional to $\lambda^{H(\xi)} \exp(\frac{\sigma}{N}A(\xi))$,
where $H(\xi):=\#\{x \ : \xi_x=0\}$ and $A(\xi)$ is the area enclosed between the path $\xi$ and
the $x$-axis. We then consider the classical heat-bath dynamics which equilibrates the value of
each $\xi_x$ at a constant rate via corner-flip. Investigating the statics of the model, we derive
the full phase diagram in $\lambda$ and $\sigma$ of this model, and identify the critical line which
separates a localized phase where the pinning force sticks the interface to the wall and a delocalized
one, for which the external force stabilizes $\xi$ around a deterministic shape at a macroscopic
distance of the wall. On the dynamical side, we identify a second critical line, which separates
a rapidly mixing phase (for which the system mixes in polynomial time) to a slow phase where the mixing
time grows exponentially. In this slowly mixing regime we obtain a sharp estimate of the mixing time
on the $\log$ scale, and provide evidences of a metastable behavior.
