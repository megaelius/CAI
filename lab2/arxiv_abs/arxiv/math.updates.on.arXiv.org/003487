The Rips filtration over a finite metric space and its corresponding persistent homology are prominent
methods in TDA to summarise the shape of data. Crucial to their use is the bottleneck stability result.
A generalisation of the Rips filtration to any symmetric function $f:X\times X\to \mathbb{R}$
was defined by Chazal, De Silva and Oudot, and they showed it was stable with respect to the correspondence
distortion distance. Allowing asymmetry, we consider four different persistence modules. The
first method is through symmetrisation. For $a\in [0,1]$ we can construct a symmetric function
$sym_a(f)(x,y)=a \min \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}+ (1-a)\max \{d(x,y), d(y,x)\}$. We can then follow
the apply the standard theory for symmetric functions and get stability as a corollary. The second
method is to construct a filtration of ordered tuple complexes where tuple $(x_0, x_2, \ldots x_p)\in
Rips^{dir}(X)_t$ if $d(x_i, x_j)\leq t$ for all $i\leq j$. These two methods have the same persistent
homology as the standard Rips filtration when applied to a metric space, or more generally to a symmetric
function. We consider two constructions using a filtration of directed graphs. We have directed
graphs $\{D(X)_t\}$, where directed edges $x\to y$ are included in $D(X)_t$ whenever $\max\{f(x,y),f(x,x),f(y,y)\}\leq
t$. From this we construct a preorder where $x\leq y$ if there is a path from $x$ to $y$ in $D(X)_t$.
We build persistence modules using the strongly connected components of the graphs $D(X)_t$, which
are the equivalence classes of the associated preorders. We consider persistence modules using
a generalisation of poset topology to preorders. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance can be extended
as a correspondence distortion distance to set-function pairs. We prove that all these new constructions
enjoy the same stability results.
