Whenever we use devices to take measurements, calibration is indispensable. While the purpose
of calibration is to reduce bias and uncertainty in the measurements, it can be quite difficult,
expensive, and sometimes even impossible to implement. We study a challenging problem called \emph{self-calibration},
i.e., the task of designing an algorithm for devices so that the algorithm is able to perform calibration
automatically. More precisely, we consider the setup $\boldsymbol{y} = \mathcal{A}(\boldsymbol{d})
\boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ where only partial information about the sensing matrix
$\mathcal{A}(\boldsymbol{d})$ is known and where $\mathcal{A}(\boldsymbol{d})$ linearly
depends on $\boldsymbol{d}$. The goal is to estimate the calibration parameter $\boldsymbol{d}$
(resolve the uncertainty in the sensing process) and the signal/object of interests $\boldsymbol{x}$
simultaneously. For three different models of practical relevance, we show how such a \emph{bilinear}
inverse problem, including blind deconvolution as an important example, can be solved via a simple
\emph{linear least squares} approach. As a consequence, the proposed algorithms are numerically
extremely efficient, thus potentially allowing for real-time deployment. We also present a variation
of the least squares approach, which leads to a~\emph{spectral method}, where the solution to the
bilinear inverse problem can be found by computing the singular vector associated with the smallest
singular value of a certain matrix derived from the bilinear system. Explicit theoretical guarantees
and stability theory are derived for both techniques; and the number of sampling complexity is nearly
optimal (up to a poly-log factor). Applications in imaging sciences and signal processing are discussed
and numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
approach.
