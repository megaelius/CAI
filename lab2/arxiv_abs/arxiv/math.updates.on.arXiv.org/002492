In this paper, we introduce a large system of interacting financial agents in which each agent is
faced with the decision of how to allocate his capital between a risky stock or a risk-less bond. The
investment decision of investors, derived through an optimization, drives the stock price. The
model has been inspired by the econophysical Levy-Levy-Solomon model (Economics Letters, 45).
The goal of this work is to gain insights into the stock price and wealth distribution. We especially
want to discover the causes for the appearance of power-laws in financial data. We follow a kinetic
approach similar to (D. Maldarella, L. Pareschi, Physica A, 391) and derive the mean field limit
of our microscopic agent dynamics. The novelty in our approach is that the financial agents apply
model predictive control (MPC) to approximate and solve the optimization of their utility function.
Interestingly, the MPC approach gives a mathematical connection between the two opponent economic
concepts of modeling financial agents to be rational or boundedly rational. Furthermore, this
is to our knowledge the first kinetic portfolio model which considers a wealth and stock price distribution
simultaneously. Due to our kinetic approach, we can study the wealth and price distribution on a
mesoscopic level. The wealth distribution is characterized by a lognormal law. For the stock price
distribution, we can either observe a lognormal behavior in the case of long-term investors or a
power-law in the case of high-frequency trader. Furthermore, the stock return data exhibits a fat-tail,
which is a well known characteristic of real financial data.
