We contrast the dynamics of the Horava theory with anisotropic Weyl symmetry with the case when this
symmetry is explicitly broken, which is called the kinetic-conformal Horava theory. To do so we
perform the canonical formulation of the anisotropic conformal theory at the classical level with
a general conformal potential. Both theories have the generator of the anisotropic Weyl transformations
as a constraint but it changes from first to second-class when the Weyl symmetry is broken. The FDiff-covariant
vector a_i = \partial_i \ln N plays the role of gauge connection for the anisotropic Weyl transformations.
A Lagrange multiplier plays also the role of gauge connection, being the time component. The anisotropic
conformal theory propagates the same number of degrees of freedom of the kinetic-conformal theory,
which in turn are the same of General Relativity. This is due to exchange of a second-class constraint
in the kinetic-conformal case by a gauge symmetry in the anisotropic conformal case. An exception
occurs if the conformal potential does not depend on the lapse function N, as is the case of the so called
Cotton^2 potential, in which case one of the physical modes becomes odd. We develop in detail two
explicit anisotropic conformal models. One of them depends on N whereas the other one is the Cotton^2
model. We also study conformally flat solutions in the anisotropic conformal and the kinetic-conformal
theories, defining as conformally flat the spatial metric, but leaving for N a form different to
the one dictated by the anisotropic Weyl transformations. We find that in both theories these configurations
have vanishing canonical momentum and they are critical points of the potential. In the kinetic-conformal
theory we find explicitly an exact, nontrivial, conformally flat solution.
