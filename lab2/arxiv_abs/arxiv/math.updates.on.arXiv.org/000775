We study approximation properties of sequences of centered random elements $X_d$, $d\in\mathbb
N$, with values in separable Hilbert spaces. We focus on sequences of tensor product-type and, in
particular, degree-type random elements, which have covariance operators of corresponding tensor
form. The average case approximation complexity $n^{X_d}(\varepsilon)$ is defined as the minimal
number of continuous linear functionals that is needed to approximate $X_d$ with relative $2$-average
error not exceeding a given threshold $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$. In the paper we investigate $n^{X_d}(\varepsilon)$
for arbitrary fixed $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ and $d\to\infty$. Namely, we find criteria of (un)boundedness
for $n^{X_d}(\varepsilon)$ on $d$ and of tending $n^{X_d}(\varepsilon)\to\infty$, $d\to\infty$,
for any fixed $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$. In the latter case we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions
for the following logarithmic asymptotics \begin{eqnarray*} \ln n^{X_d}(\varepsilon)= a_d+q(\varepsilon)b_d+o(b_d),\quad
d\to\infty, \end{eqnarray*} at continuity points of a non-decreasing function $q\colon (0,1)\to\mathbb
R$. Here $(a_d)_{d\in\mathbb N}$ is a sequence and $(b_d)_{d\in\mathbb N}$ is a positive sequence
such that $b_d\to\infty$, $d\to\infty$. Under rather weak assumptions, we show that for tensor
product-type random elements only special quantiles of self-decomposable or, in particular,
stable (for tensor degrees) probability distributions appear as functions $q$ in the asymptotics.
We apply our results to the tensor products of the Euler integrated processes with a given variation
of smoothness parameters and to the tensor degrees of random elements with regularly varying eigenvalues
of covariance operator.
