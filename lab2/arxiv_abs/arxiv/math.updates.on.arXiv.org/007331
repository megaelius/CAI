Linear complementarity problems are a powerful tool for modeling many practically relevant situations
such as market equilibria. They also connect many sub-areas of mathematics like game theory, optimization,
and matrix theory. Despite their close relation to optimization, the protection of LCPs against
uncertainties - especially in the sense of robust optimization - is still in its infancy. During
the last years, robust LCPs have only been studied using the notions of strict and {\Gamma}-robustness.
Unfortunately, both concepts lead to the problem that the existence of robust solutions cannot
be guaranteed. In this paper, we consider affinely adjustable robust LCPs. In the latter, a part
of the LCP solution is allowed to adjust via a function that is affine in the uncertainty. We show that
this notion of robustness allows to establish strong characterizations of solutions for the cases
of uncertain matrix and vector, separately, from which existence results can be derived. For an
uncertain LCP vector, we additionally provide sufficient conditions on the LCP matrix for the uniqueness
of a solution. Moreover, based on characterizations of the affinely adjustable robust solutions,
we derive a mixed-integer programming formulation that allows to solve the corresponding robust
counterpart. If the LCP matrix is uncertain, characterizations of solutions are developed for
every nominal matrix, i.e., these characterizations are, in particular, independent of the definiteness
of the nominal matrix. Robust solutions are also shown to be unique for positive definite LCP matrix
but both uniqueness and mixed-integer programming formulations still remain open problems if
the nominal LCP matrix is not positive definite.
