In this article, we investigate two famous combinatorial conjectures from topological perspectives.
More than half century ago, Stephen T. Hedetniemi conjectured that the chromatic number of the categorical
product of two graphs is equal to the minimum of their chromatic numbers. Regarding this conjecture,
we prove that the cohomological-index (Stiefel-Whitney height) of the Cartesian product of two
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-spaces is equal to the minimum of their cohomological-indexes. This result helps
us to strengthen the family of known graphs satisfying Hedetniemi's conjecture. Later, this conjecture
was generalized for hypergraphs by Xuding Zhu. To approach Zhu's conjecture, we take a different
route. We define compatibility $r$-hypergraph $\mathcal{C}_P^{(r)}$ which is assigned to a $G$-poset
$P$; a partially ordered set equipped with a group action $G$. Then, we establish a connection between
the chromatic number of this hypergraph and a topological property of the order complex of $P$. Via
this connection, we will present several topological lower bounds for the chromatic number of the
categorical product of two hypergraphs. Consequently, we enrich the family of known graphs satisfying
Zhu's conjecture using these bounds. Especially, we reprove the known fact that Zhu's conjecture
is valid for the usual Kneser $r$-hypergraphs. We also give some other applications of compatibility
hypergraphs. We give a new proof of Erd\H{o}s's conjecture which states: The chromatic number of
the usual Kneser $r$-hypergraph ${KG}^{r}(n,k)$ is $\left\lceil\frac{n-r(k-1)}{r-1}\right\rceil$
where $k\geq 1, r\geq 2$, and $n\geq rk$. Furthermore, we present a new way for constructing $r$-hypergraph
with arbitrary high chromatic number and the smallest possible clique number, i.e., $r$.
