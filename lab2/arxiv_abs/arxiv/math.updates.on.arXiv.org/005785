Wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) extends the search space of Full Waveform Inversion
(FWI) by allowing for wave equation errors during wavefield reconstruction to match the data from
the first iteration. Then, the wavespeeds are updated from the wavefields by minimizing the source
residuals. Performing these two tasks in alternating mode breaks down the nonlinear FWI as a sequence
of two linear subproblems, relaying on the bilinearity of the wave equation. We solve this biconvex
optimization with the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to cancel out efficiently
the data and source residuals in iterations and stabilize the parameter estimation with appropriate
regularizations. Here, we extend WRI to viscoacoustic media for attenuation imaging. Attenuation
reconstruction is challenging because of the small imprint of attenuation in the data and the cross-talks
with velocities. To address these issues, we recast the multivariate viscoacoustic WRI as a triconvex
optimization and update wavefields, squared slowness, and attenuation factor in alternating
mode at each WRI iteration. This requires to linearize the attenuation-estimation subproblem
via an approximated trilinear viscoacoustic wave equation. The iterative defect correction embedded
in ADMM corrects the errors generated by this linearization, while the operator splitting allows
us to tailor $\ell{1}$ regularization to each parameter class. A toy numerical example shows that
these strategies mitigate cross-talk artifacts and noise from the attenuation reconstruction.
A more realistic synthetic example representative of the North Sea validates the method.
