We give a construction of a new $p$-adic Maass-Shimura operator defined on an affinoid subdomain
of the preperfectoid $p$-adic universal cover $\mathcal{Y}$ of a modular curve $Y$. We define a
new notion of $p$-adic modular forms as sections of a certain sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ of "nearly
rigid functions" which transform under the action of subgroups of the Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathcal{Y}/Y)$
by $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}^{\times}$-valued weight characters. This extends Katz's notion of
$p$-adic modular forms as functions on the Igusa tower $Y^{\mathrm{Ig}}$; indeed we may recover
Katz's theory by restricting to a natural $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$-covering $\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{Ig}}$
of $Y^{\mathrm{Ig}}$, viewing $\mathcal{Y}^{\mathrm{Ig}} \subset \mathcal{Y}$ as a sublocus.
Our $p$-adic Maass-Shimura operator sends $p$-adic modular forms of weight $k$ to forms of weight
$k + 2$. Its construction comes from a relative Hodge decomposition with coefficients in $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$
defined using Hodge-Tate and Hodge-de Rham periods arising from Scholze's Hodge-Tate period map
and the relative $p$-adic de Rham comparison theorem. By studying the effect of powers of the $p$-adic
Maass-Shimura operator on modular forms, we construct a $p$-adic continuous function which satisfies
an "approximate" interpolation property with respect to the the algebraic parts of central critical
$L$-values of anticyclotomic Rankin-Selberg families on $GL_2 \times GL_1$ over imaginary quadratic
fields $K/\mathbb{Q}$, including the "supersingular" case where $p$ is not split in $K$. Finally
we establish a new $p$-adic Waldspurger formula which, in the case of a newform, relates the formal
logarithm of a Heegner point to a special value of the $p$-adic $L$-function.
