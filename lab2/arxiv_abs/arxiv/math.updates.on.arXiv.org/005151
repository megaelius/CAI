In this paper, we propose a general framework for distribution-free nonparametric testing in multi-dimensions,
based on a notion of multivariate ranks defined using the theory of measure transportation. Unlike
other existing proposals in the literature, these multivariate ranks share a number of useful properties
with the usual one-dimensional ranks; most importantly, these ranks are distribution-free. This
crucial observation allows us to design nonparametric tests that are exactly distribution-free
under the null hypothesis. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach by constructing exact
distribution-free tests for two classical nonparametric problems: (i) testing for mutual independence
between random vectors, and (ii) testing for the equality of multivariate distributions. In particular,
we propose (multivariate) rank versions of distance covariance (Sz\'ekely et al., 2007) and energy
statistic (Sz\'ekely and Rizzo, 2013) for testing scenarios (i) and (ii) respectively. In both
these problems, we derive the asymptotic null distribution of the proposed test statistics. We
further show that our tests are consistent against all fixed alternatives. Moreover, the proposed
tests are tuning-free, computationally feasible and are well-defined under minimal assumptions
on the underlying distributions (e.g., they do not need any moment assumptions). We also demonstrate
the efficacy of these procedures via extensive simulations. In the process of analyzing the theoretical
properties of our procedures, we end up proving some new results in the theory of measure transportation
and in the limit theory of permutation statistics using Stein's method for exchangeable pairs,
which may be of independent interest.
