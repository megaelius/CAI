This paper considers a stochastic Nash game in which each player minimizes an expectation valued
composite objective. We make the following contributions. (I) Under suitable monotonicity assumptions
on the concatenated gradient map, we derive ({\bf optimal}) rate statements and oracle complexity
bounds for the proposed variable sample-size proximal stochastic gradient-response (VS-PGR)
scheme when the sample-size increases at a geometric rate. If the sample-size increases at a polynomial
rate of degree $v > 0$, the mean-squared errordecays at a corresponding polynomial rate while the
iteration and oracle complexities to obtain an $\epsilon$-NE are $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{1/v})$
and $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{1+1/v})$, respectively. (II) We then overlay (VS-PGR) with a consensus
phase with a view towards developing distributed protocols for aggregative stochastic Nash games.
In the resulting scheme, when the sample-size and the consensus steps grow at a geometric and linear
rate, computing an $\epsilon$-NE requires similar iteration and oracle complexities to (VS-PGR)
with a communication complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\ln^2(1/\epsilon))$; (III) Under a suitable
contractive property associated with the proximal best-response (BR) map, we design a variable
sample-size proximal BR (VS-PBR) scheme, where each player solves a sample-average BR problem.
Akin to (I), we also give the rate statements, oracle and iteration complexity bounds. (IV) Akin
to (II), the distributed variant achieves similar iteration and oracle complexities to the centralized
(VS-PBR) with a communication complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\ln^2(1/\epsilon))$ when the communication
rounds per iteration increase at a linear rate. Finally, we present some preliminary numerics to
provide empirical support for the rate and complexity statements.
