This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control approach for nonlinear systems subject
to time-invariant probabilistic uncertainties in model parameters and initial conditions. The
stochastic optimal control problem entails a cost function in terms of expected values and higher
moments of the states, and chance constraints that ensure probabilistic constraint satisfaction.
The generalized polynomial chaos framework is used to propagate the time-invariant stochastic
uncertainties through the nonlinear system dynamics, and to efficiently sample from the probability
densities of the states to approximate the satisfaction probability of the chance constraints.
To increase computational efficiency by avoiding excessive sampling, a statistical analysis
is proposed to systematically determine a-priori the least conservative constraint tightening
required at a given sample size to guarantee a desired feasibility probability of the sample-approximated
chance constraint optimization problem. In addition, a method is presented for sample-based approximation
of the analytic gradients of the chance constraints, which increases the optimization efficiency
significantly. The proposed stochastic nonlinear model predictive control approach is applicable
to a broad class of nonlinear systems with the sufficient condition that each term is analytic with
respect to the states, and separable with respect to the inputs, states and parameters. The closed-loop
performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the Williams-Otto reactor with seven states,
and ten uncertain parameters and initial conditions. The results demonstrate the efficiency of
the approach for real-time stochastic model predictive control and its capability to systematically
account for probabilistic uncertainties in contrast to a nonlinear model predictive control approaches.
