Given a black box group $\mathsf{Y}$ encrypting $\rm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F})$ over an unknown field
$\mathbb{F}$ of unknown odd characteristic $p$ and a global exponent $E$ for $\mathsf{Y}$ (that
is, an integer $E$ such that $\mathsf{y}^E=1$ for all $\mathsf{y} \in \mathsf{Y}$), we present
a Las Vegas algorithm which constructs a unipotent element in $\mathsf{Y}$. The running time of
our algorithm is polynomial in $\log E$. This answers the question posed by Babai and Beals in 1999.
We also find the characteristic of the underlying field in time polynomial in $\log E$ and linear
in $p$. Furthermore, we construct, in probabilistic time polynomial in $\log E$, 1. a black box group
$\mathsf{X}$ encrypting $\rm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}) \cong\rm{SO}_3(\mathbb{F})$, its subgroup
$\mathsf{Y}^\circ$ of index $2$ isomorphic to $\mathsf{Y}$ and a probabilistic polynomial in
$\log E$ time isomorphism $\mathsf{Y}^\circ \longrightarrow \mathsf{Y}$; 2. a black box field
$\mathsf{K}$, and 3. polynomial time, in $\log E$, isomorphisms \[ \rm{SO}_3(\mathsf{K}) \longrightarrow
\mathsf{X} \longrightarrow \rm{SO}_3(\mathsf{K}). \] If, in addition, we know $p$ and the standard
explicitly given finite field $\mathbb{F}$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}$ then we construct, in time
polynomial in $\log E$, isomorphism \[ \rm{SO}_3(\mathbb{F})\longrightarrow \rm{SO}_3(\mathsf{K}).
\] Unlike many papers on black box groups, our algorithms make no use of additional oracles other
than the black box group operations. Moreover, our result acts as an $\rm{SL}_2$-oracle in the black
box group theory. We implemented our algorithms in GAP and tested them for groups such as $\rm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{F})$
for $|\mathbb{F}|=115756986668303657898962467957$ (a prime number).
