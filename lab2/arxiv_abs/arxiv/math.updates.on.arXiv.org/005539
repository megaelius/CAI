The 5G network connecting billions of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices will make it possible to
harvest an enormous amount of real-time mobile data. Furthermore, the 5G virtualization architecture
will enable cloud computing at the (network) edge. The availability of both rich data and computation
power at the edge has motivated Internet companies to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) there,
creating the hot area of edge-AI. Edge learning, the theme of this project, concerns training edge-AI
models, which endow on IoT devices intelligence for responding to real-time events. However, the
transmission of high-dimensional data from many edge devices to servers can result in excessive
communication latency, creating a bottleneck for edge learning. Traditional wireless techniques
deigned for only radio access are ineffective in tackling the challenge. Attempts to overcome the
communication bottleneck has led to the development of a new class of techniques for intelligent
radio resource management (RRM), called data-importance aware RRM. Their designs feature the
interplay of active machine learning and wireless communication. Specifically, the metrics that
measure data importance in active learning (e.g., classification uncertainty and data diversity)
are applied to RRM for efficient acquisition of distributed data in wireless networks to train AI
models at servers. This article aims at providing an introduction to the emerging area of importance-aware
RRM. To this end, we will introduce the design principles, survey recent advancements in the area,
discuss some design examples, and suggest some promising research opportunities.
