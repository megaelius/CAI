In the continuum, close connections exist between mean curvature flow, the Allen-Cahn (AC) partial
differential equation, and the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) threshold dynamics scheme. Graph
analogues of these processes have recently seen a rise in popularity as relaxations of NP-complete
combinatorial problems, which demands deeper theoretical underpinnings of the graph processes.
The aim of this paper is to introduce these graph processes in the light of their continuum counterparts,
provide some background, prove the first results connecting them, illustrate these processes
with examples and identify open questions for future study. We derive a graph curvature from the
graph cut function, the natural graph counterpart of total variation (perimeter). This derivation
and the resulting curvature definition differ from those in earlier literature, where the continuum
mean curvature is simply discretized, and bears many similarities to the continuum nonlocal curvature
or nonlocal means formulation. This new graph curvature is not only relevant for graph MBO dynamics,
but also appears in the variational formulation of a discrete time graph mean curvature flow. We
prove estimates showing that the dynamics are trivial for both MBO and AC evolutions if the parameters
(the time-step and diffuse interface scale, respectively) are sufficiently small (a phenomenon
known as "freezing" or "pinning") and also that the dynamics for MBO are nontrivial if the time step
is large enough. These bounds are in terms of graph quantities such as the spectrum of the graph Laplacian
and the graph curvature. Adapting a Lyapunov functional for the continuum MBO scheme to graphs,
we prove that the graph MBO scheme converges to a stationary state in a finite number of iterations.
Variations on this scheme have recently become popular in the literature as ways to minimize (continuum)
nonlocal total variation.
