The cyclic sieving phenomenon of Reiner, Stanton, and White says that we can often count fixed points
for a cyclic group acting on a combinatorial set by plugging roots of unity into a polynomial related
to this set. One of the most impressive instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon is a theorem of
Rhoades asserting that the set of plane partitions in a rectangular box under the action of promotion
exhibits cyclic sieving. In Rhoades's result the sieving polynomial is the size generating function
for these plane partitions, which has a well-known product formula due to MacMahon. We extend Rhoades's
result by also considering symmetries of plane partitions: specifically, complementation and
transposition. Actually, Rhoades has already studied the way that promotion and complementation
interact. Our contribution is to study how promotion and transposition, and promotion and transpose-complementation,
interact, and to give cyclic sieving-like formulas in this context. The relevant polynomial here
is the size generating function for symmetric plane partitions, whose product formula was conjectured
by MacMahon and proved by Andrews. We then go on to consider the way these same symmetries interact
with rowmotion, another operator acting on plane partitions closely related to promotion. Rowmotion,
unlike promotion, is defined for any poset. Our original motivation for studying the way that rowmotion
interacts with these symmetries was a series of cyclic sieving conjectures we made in a previous
paper concerning rowmotion acting on $P$-partitions for certain triangular posets $P$. As we explain,
these conjectures can be rephrased in terms of counting the number of plane partitions fixed by various
subgroups of the group generated by rowmotion and transposition. Our results in this paper do not
directly imply anything about these conjectures, but they are morally very similar.
