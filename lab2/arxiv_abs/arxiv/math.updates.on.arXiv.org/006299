Caching at mobile devices and leveraging device- to-device (D2D) communication are two promising
approaches to support massive content delivery over wireless networks. The analysis of cache-enabled
wireless networks is usually carried out by assuming that devices are uniformly distributed, however,
in social networks, mobile devices are intrinsically grouped into disjoint clusters. In this regards,
this paper proposes a spatiotemporal mathematical model that tracks the service requests arrivals
and account for the clustered devices geometry. Two kinds of devices are assumed, particularly,
content clients and content providers. Content providers are assumed to have a surplus memory which
is exploited to proactively cache contents from a known library, following a random probabilistic
caching scheme. Content clients can retrieve a requested content from the nearest content provider
in their proximity (cluster), or, as a last resort, the base station (BS). The developed spatiotemporal
model is leveraged to formulate a joint optimization problem of the content caching and spectrum
partitioning in order to minimize the average service delay. Due to the high complexity of the optimization
problem, the caching and spectrum partitioning problems are decoupled and solved iteratively
using the block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization technique. To this end, an optimal and suboptimal
solutions are obtained for the bandwidth partitioning and probabilistic caching subproblems,
respectively. Numerical results highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional
caching schemes under equal and optimized bandwidth allocations. Particularly, it is shown that
the average service delay is reduced by nearly 100% and 350%, compared to the Zipf and uniform caching
schemes under equal bandwidth allocations, respectively.
