We introduce a class of densely defined, unbounded, 2-Hochschild cocycles on finite von Neumann
algebras $M$. This class of cocycles, has the property that, they admit a coboundary, implemented
by an unbounded operator on the standard Hilbert space, with non-trivial real part. For the cocycles
associated to the $\Gamma$-equivariant deformation ([Ra]) of the upperhalfplane $(\Gamma=\PSL_2(\Z))$,
the "imaginary" part of the coboundary operator is a cohonological obstruction -- it can not be removed
by closable derivation, with non-trivial real part, that also has a joint core domain, with the initial
coboundary. On the contrary, the von Neumann algebra $L(F_\infty)$ of the fee group with infinitely
many generators admits such derivations, with similar domains. On the von Neumann algebra $L(\Gamma)$,
using the higher order Berezin's symbol, we construct a densely defined semigroup $\Phi_t$ (completely
positive on a dense subset), so that $\Phi_t(1)^{-1/2}\Phi_t\Phi_t(1)^{-1/2}$ is trace scaling,
and strictly decreasing support. As a byproduct, we prove a strenghtening of the nontriviality
of the Euler cocycle in the bounded cohomology $H^2_{\rm bound}(\Gamma,\Z)$. We consider the Hilbert
space of diagonally $\Gamma$ invariant functions, on $\bH\times\bH$, analytic in the first variable,
antianalytic in the second, square summable with respect to the measure $d^t(z,\eta)(\Im z)^{-2}(\Im\eta)^{-2}$
on $F\times\bH$, where $F$ is a fundamental domain, $d$ is the cosinus of the hyperbolic distance.
We prove that the unbounded antisymmetric Toeplitz operator with symbol $i[\arg(z-\bar{\zeta})+\arg\Delta(z)-\arg\Delta(\zeta)]$
(where $\Delta$ is the Dedekind cusp form), has deficiency indices $(0, 1)$.
