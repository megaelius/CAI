We study a refinement of the quantum unique ergodicity conjecture for shrinking balls on arithmetic
hyperbolic manifolds, with a focus on dimensions $ 2 $ and $ 3 $. For the Eisenstein series for the modular
surface $\mathrm{PSL}_2( {\mathbb Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H}^2$ we prove failure of quantum unique
ergodicity close to the Planck-scale and an improved bound for its quantum variance. For arithmetic
$ 3 $-manifolds we show that quantum unique ergodicity of Hecke-Maa{\ss} forms fails on shrinking
balls centered on an arithmetic point and radius $ R \asymp t_j^{-\delta} $ with $ \delta > 3/4 $. For
$ \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K) \setminus \mathbb{H}^3 $ with $ \mathcal{O}_K $ being the ring
of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field of class number one, we prove, conditionally
on the generalized Lindel\"of hypothesis, that equidistribution holds for Hecke-Maa{ss} forms
if $ \delta < 2/5 $. Furthermore, we prove that equidistribution holds unconditionally for the Eisenstein
series if $ \delta < (1-2\theta)/(34+4\theta) $ where $ \theta $ is the exponent towards the Ramanujan-Petersson
conjecture. For $ \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[i]) $ we improve the last exponent to $ \delta < (1-2\theta)/(27+2\theta)
$. Studying mean Lindel\"of estimates for $ L $-functions of Hecke-Maa{\ss} forms we improve the
last exponent on average to $ \delta < 2/5$. Finally, we study massive irregularities for Laplace
eigenfunctions on $ n $-dimensional compact arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds for $ n \geq 4 $. We
observe that quantum unique ergodicity fails on shrinking balls of radii $ R \asymp t^{-\delta_n+\epsilon}
$ away from the Planck-scale, with $ \delta_n = 5/(n+1) $ for $ n \geq 5 $.
