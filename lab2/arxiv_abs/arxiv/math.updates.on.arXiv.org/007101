We study the complex geometry and function theory of two families of polynomially convex domains.
The first family is the symmetrized polydisc, given by \[ \mathbb G_n :=\left\{ \left(\sum_{1\leq
i\leq n} z_i,\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n}z_iz_j \dots, \prod_{i=1}^n z_i \right): \,z_i \in \mathbb
D, i=1,\dots,n \right \}. \] The second family is the extended symmetrized polydisc $\widetilde{\mathbb
G}_n$, which we introduce and define by \begin{align*} \widetilde{\mathbb G}_n := \Bigg\{ (y_1,\dots,y_{n-1},
q)\in \mathbb C^n :\; q \in \mathbb D, \; y_j = \be_j + \bar \be_{n-j} q, \; \beta_j \in \mathbb C &\text{
and }\\ |\beta_j|+ |\beta_{n-j}| < {n \choose j} &\text{ for } j=1,\dots, n-1 \Bigg\}. \end{align*}
We show that ${\mathbb G}_n \subset \widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$. We obtain characterizations of
the points in $\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$ and $\overline{\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n}$. As a consequence
we get a similar set of characterizations for $\mathbb G_n$ and $\overline{\mathbb G_n}$. We find
few other geometric properties of $\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$ and ${\mathbb G}_n$. We make some
sharp estimates to prove a Schwarz type lemma for $\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$ from which a Schwarz
type lemma for ${\mathbb G}_n$ follows. The conditions that are obtained in the Schwarz lemma for
$\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$ and ${\mathbb G}_n$ are necessary for the existence of such an interpolant.
We find a particular subset $\mathcal J_n$ of $\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$, for which these conditions
are sufficient too. In particular $\mathcal J_n=\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$ for $n=1,2,3$. We describe
all such interpolating functions from $\mathbb D$ to $\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$ for $n=3$. Also
we show the coincidence of the Carath\'{e}odory pseudo distance and the Lempert function for two
points $z,w\in \mathcal J_n$ provided that one of $z,w$ is equal to $0$.
