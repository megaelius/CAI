This paper contributes to an in-depth study of properties of CTMCs on non-negative integer lattices,
with particular interest in one-dimensional CTMCs with polynomial transitions rates. We study
the classification of states for general CTMCs on the non-negative integer lattices, by characterizing
the set of states (absorbing, trapping, escaping, positive irreducible components and quasi-irreducible
components). For CTMCs on non-negative integers with polynomial transition rates, we provide
threshold checkable criteria (in terms of parameters) for various dynamical properties-explosivity,
recurrence versus transience, positive recurrence versus null recurrence, implosivity, as well
as existence and non-existence of passage times; in particular, checkable sufficient conditions
for exponential ergodicity of stationary and quasi-stationary distributions are obtained. Moreover,
an identity for stationary measures is established and asymptotics of tails of stationary distributions
are estimated. Similar identity as well as asymptotics are derived for quasi-stationary distributions.
As a prominent application, we apply our results to stochastic (biochemical) reaction networks
(SRNs). In particular, we show all weakly reversible mass-action reaction networks with one-dimensional
stoichiometric subspaces not only are positive recurrent but have a unique exponentially ergodic
stationary distribution with Conley-Maxwell-Poisson tail on every positive irreducible component,
which confirms in one-dimensional case the recently proposed positive recurrence conjecture
[D.F. Anderson and J. Kim, Some network conditions for positive recurrence of stochastically modeled
reaction networks, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2018), 2692--2713.].
