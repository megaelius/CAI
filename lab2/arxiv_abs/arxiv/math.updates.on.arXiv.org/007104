Due to the wide separation of time scales in geophysical fluid dynamics, semi-implicit time integrators
are commonly used in operational atmospheric forecast models. They guarantee the stable treatment
of fast (acoustic and gravity) waves, while not suffering from severe restrictions on the timestep
size. To propagate the state of the atmosphere forward in time, a non-linear equation for the prognostic
variables has to be solved at every timestep. Since the nonlinearity is typically weak, this is done
with a small number of Newton- or Picard- iterations, which in turn require the efficient solution
of a large system on linear equations with $\mathcal{O}(10^6-10^9)$ unknowns. This linear solve
is often the computationally most costly part of the model. In this paper an efficient linear solver
for the LFRic next-generation model, currently developed by the Met Office, is described. The model
uses an advanced mimetic finite element discretisation which makes the construction of efficient
solvers challenging compared to models using standard finite-difference and finite-volume methods.
The linear solver hinges on a bespoke multigrid preconditioner of the Schur-complement system
for the pressure correction. By comparing to Krylov-subspace methods, the superior performance
and robustness of the multigrid algorithm is demonstrated for standard test cases and realistic
model setups. In production mode, the model will have to run in parallel on 100,000s of processing
elements. As confirmed by numerical experiments, one particular advantage of the multigrid solver
is its excellent parallel scalability due to avoiding expensive global reduction operations.
