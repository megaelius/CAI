We present a criterion for uniform in time convergence of the weak error of the Euler scheme for Stochastic
Differential equations (SDEs). The criterion requires i) exponential decay in time of the space-derivatives
of the semigroup associated with the SDE and ii) bounds on (some) moments of the Euler approximation.
We show by means of examples (and counterexamples) how both i) and ii) are needed to obtain the desired
result. If the weak error converges to zero uniformly in time, then convergence of ergodic averages
follows as well. We also show that Lyapunov-type conditions are neither sufficient nor necessary
in order for the weak error of the Euler approximation to converge uniformly in time and clarify relations
between the validity of Lyapunov conditions, i) and ii). Conditions for ii) to hold are studied in
the literature. Here we produce sufficient conditions for i) to hold. The study of derivative estimates
has attracted a lot of attention, however not many results are known in order to guarantee exponentially
fast decay of the derivatives. Exponential decay of derivatives typically follows from coercive-type
conditions involving the vector fields appearing in the equation and their commutators; here we
focus on the case in which such coercive-type conditions are non-uniform in space. To the best of
our knowledge, this situation is unexplored in the literature, at least on a systematic level. To
obtain results under such space-inhomogeneous conditions we initiate a pathwise approach to the
study of derivative estimates for diffusion semigroups and combine this pathwise method with the
use of Large Deviation Principles.
