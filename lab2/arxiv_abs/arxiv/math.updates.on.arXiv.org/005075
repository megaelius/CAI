Ecological systems are complex dynamical systems. Modelling efforts on ecosystems' dynamical
stability have revealed that population dynamics, being highly nonlinear, can be governed by complex
fluctuations. Indeed, experimental and field research has provided mounting evidence of chaos
in species' abundances, especially for discrete-time systems. Discrete-time dynamics, mainly
arising in boreal and temperate ecosystems for species with non-overlapping generations, have
been largely studied to understand the dynamical outcomes due to changes in relevant ecological
parameters. The local and global dynamical behaviour of many of these models is difficult to investigate
analytically in the parameter space and, typically, numerical approaches are employed when the
dimension of the phase space is large. In this article we provide topological and dynamical results
for a map modelling a discrete-time, three-species food chain with two predator species interacting
on the same prey population. The domain where dynamics live is characterized, as well as the so-called
escaping regions, for which the species go rapidly to extinction after surpassing the carrying
capacity. We also provide a full description of the local stability of equilibria within a volume
of the parameter space given by the prey's growth rate and the predation rates. We have found that
the increase of the pressure of predators on the prey results in chaos. The entry into chaos is achieved
via a supercritical Neimarck-Sacker bifurcation followed by period-doubling bifurcations of
invariant curves. Interestingly, an increasing predation directly on preys can shift the extinction
of top predators to their survival, allowing an unstable persistence of the three species by means
of periodic and strange chaotic attractors.
