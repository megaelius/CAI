Fourier multiplier analysis is developed for peridynamic Laplace operators, which are defined
for scalar fields in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The focus is on operators $L_{\delta,\beta}$ which are commonly
used in peridynamic models. The Fourier multipliers $m(\nu)$ of $L_{\delta,\beta}$ are given
through an integral representation, which is shown to be well-defined for $\beta<n+2$. The integral
representation of the Fourier multipliers is recognized explicitly through a unified and general
formula in terms of the hypergeometric function $_2F_3$ in any spatial dimension $n$ and for any
$\beta<n+2$. The new general formula for the multipliers is well-defined for any $\beta\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{n+4,n+6,n+8,\ldots\}$
and is utilized to extend the definition of the peridynamic Laplacians to the case when $\beta\ge
n+2$. Some special cases are presented. The multipliers $m(\nu)$ converge to the multipliers of
$\Delta$ as $\beta\rightarrow n+2$. Moreover, as $\beta\rightarrow -\infty$, the multpliers
$m(\nu)$ converge to the multipliers of a limit integral operator $L_{\delta,-\infty}$ with kernel
supported in the $(n-1)$-sphere. Asymptotic analysis of $_2F_3$ is utilized to identify the asymptotic
behavior of the Fourier multipliers as $\|\nu\|\rightarrow \infty$. We show that the multipliers
are bounded when the peridynamic Laplacian has an integrable kernel (i.e., when $\beta<n$), diverge
to $-\infty$ at a rate proportional to $-\log(\|\nu\|)$ when $\beta=n$, and diverge to $-\infty$
at a rate proportional to $-\|\nu\|^{\beta-n}$ when $\beta>n$. The bounds and decay rates are presented
explicitly in terms of $n$, $\beta$, and the nonlocality $\delta$. In the special case of periodic
domains, the Fourier multipliers are the eigenvalues of $L_{\delta,\beta}$ and therefore the
presented results provide characterization formulas and asymptotic behavior for the eigenvalues.
