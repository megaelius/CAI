Among its many corollaries, Poincare duality implies that the de Rham cohomology of a compact oriented
manifold is a shifted commutative Frobenius algebra --- a commutative Frobenius algebra in which
the comultiplication has cohomological degree equal to the dimension of the manifold. We study
the question of whether this structure lifts to a "homotopy" shifted commutative Frobenius algebra
structure at the cochain level. To make this question nontrivial, we impose a mild locality-type
condition that we call "quasilocality": strict locality at the cochain level is unreasonable,
but it is reasonable to ask for homotopically-constant families of operations that become local
"in the limit." To make the question concrete, we take the manifold to be the one-dimensional circle.
The answer to whether a quasilocal homotopy-Frobenius algebra structure exists turns out to depend
on the choice of context in which to do homotopy algebra. There are two reasonable worlds in which
to study structures (like Frobenius algebras) that involve many-to-many operations: one can work
at "tree level," corresponding roughly to the world of operadic homotopy algebras and their homotopy
modules; or one can work at "graph level," corresponding to the world of PROPs. For the tree-level
version of our question, the answer is the unsurprising "Yes, such a structure exists" --- indeed,
it is unique up to a contractible space of choices. But for the graph-level version, the answer is
the surprising "No, such a structure does not exist." Most of the paper consists of computing explicitly
this nonexistence, which is controlled by the numerical value of a certain obstruction, and we compute
this value explicitly via a sequence of integrals.
