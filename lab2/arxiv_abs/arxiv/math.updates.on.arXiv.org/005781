Hellsten \cite{MR2026390} gave a characterization of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable subsets of a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable
cardinal in terms of a natural filter base: when $\kappa$ is a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable cardinal,
a set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable if and only if $S\cap C\neq\emptyset$ for
every $n$-club $C\subseteq \kappa$. We generalize Hellsten's characterization to $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable
subsets of $P_\kappa\lambda$, which were first defined by Baumgartner. After showing that under
reasonable assumptions the $\Pi^1_0$-indescribability ideal on $P_\kappa\lambda$ equals the
minimal \emph{strongly} normal ideal $\text{NSS}_{\kappa,\lambda}$ on $P_\kappa\lambda$,
and is not equal to $\text{NS}_{\kappa,\lambda}$ as may be expected, we formulate a notion of $n$-club
subset of $P_\kappa\lambda$ and prove that a set $S\subseteq P_\kappa\lambda$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable
if and only if $S\cap C\neq\emptyset$ for every $n$-club $C\subseteq P_\kappa\lambda$. We also
prove that elementary embeddings considered by Schanker \cite{MR2989393} witnessing \emph{near
supercompactness} lead to the definition of a normal ideal on $P_\kappa\lambda$, and indeed, this
ideal is equal to Baumgartner's ideal of non--$\Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $P_\kappa\lambda$.
Additionally, as applications of these results we answer a question of Cox-L\"ucke \cite{MR3620068}
about $\mathcal{F}$-layered posets, provide a characterization of $\Pi^m_n$-indescribable
subsets of $P_\kappa\lambda$ in terms of generic elementary embeddings, prove several results
involving a two-cardinal weakly compact diamond principle and observe that a result of Pereira
\cite{MR3640048} yeilds the consistency of the existence of a $(\kappa,\kappa^+)$-semimorasses
$\mu\subseteq P_\kappa\kappa^+$ which is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable for all $n<\omega$.
