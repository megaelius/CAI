Several new methods of numerical integration of Cauchy problems with blow-up solutions for nonlinear
ordinary differential equations of the first- and second-order are described. Solutions of such
problems have singularities whose positions are unknown a priori (the standard numerical methods
for solving problems with blow-up solutions can lead to significant errors). The first proposed
method is based on the transition to an equivalent system of equations by introducing a new independent
variable chosen as the first derivative. The second method is based on introducing a new auxiliary
non-local variable with the subsequent transformation to the Cauchy problem for the corresponding
system of ODEs. The third method is based on adding to the original equation of a differential constraint,
which is an auxiliary ODE connecting the given variables and a new variable. The proposed methods
lead to problems whose solutions are represented in parametric form and do not have blowing-up singular
points; therefore the transformed problems admit the application of standard fixed-step numerical
methods. The efficiency of these methods is illustrated by solving a number of test problems that
admit an exact analytical solution. It is shown that: (i) the methods based on non-local transformations
of a special kind are more efficient than several other methods, (ii) among the proposed methods,
the most general method is the method based on the differential constraints. Some examples of nonclassical
blow-up problems are considered. Simple theoretical estimates are derived for the critical value
of an independent variable. It is shown that the method based on a non-local transformation of the
general form as well as the method based on the differential constraints admit generalizations
to the $n$th-order ODEs and systems of coupled ODEs.
