Supporting high mobility in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems enables a wide range of important
applications such as vehicular communications and wireless virtual/augmented reality. Realizing
this in practice, though, requires overcoming several challenges. First, the use of narrow beams
and the sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockage greatly impact the coverage and reliability of
highly-mobile links. Second, highly-mobile users in dense mmWave deployments need to frequently
hand-off between base stations (BSs), which is associated with critical control and latency overhead.
Further, identifying the optimal beamforming vectors in large antenna array mmWave systems requires
considerable training overhead, which significantly affects the efficiency of these mobile systems.
In this paper, a novel integrated machine learning and coordinated beamforming solution is developed
to overcome these challenges and enable highly-mobile mmWave applications. In the proposed solution,
a number of distributed yet coordinating BSs simultaneously serve a mobile user. This user ideally
needs to transmit only one uplink training pilot sequence that will be jointly received at the coordinating
BSs using omni or quasi-omni beam patterns. These received signals draw a defining signature not
only for the user location, but also for its interaction with the surrounding environment. The developed
solution then leverages a deep learning model that learns how to use these signatures to predict
the beamforming vectors at the BSs. This renders a comprehensive solution that supports highly-mobile
mmWave applications with reliable coverage, low latency, and negligible training overhead. Simulation
results show that the proposed deep-learning coordinated beamforming strategy approaches the
achievable rate of the genie-aided solution that knows the optimal beamforming vectors with no
training overhead.
