Suppose one has a collection of disks of various sizes with disjoint interiors, a packing, in the
plane, and suppose the ratio of the smallest radius divided by the largest radius lies between $1$
and $q$. In his 1964 book \textit{Regular Figures} \cite{MR0165423}, L\'aszl\'o Fejes T\'oth
found a series of packings that were his best guess for the maximum density for any $1> q > 0.2$. Meanwhile
Gerd Blind in \cite{MR0275291,MR0377702} proved that for $1\ge q > 0.72$, the most dense packing
possible is $\pi/\sqrt{12}$, which is when all the disks are the same size. In \cite{MR0165423},
the upper bound of the ratio $q$ such that the density of his packings greater than $\pi/\sqrt{12}$
that Fejes T\'oth found was $0.6457072159..$. Here we improve that upper bound to $0.6585340820..$.
Both bounds were obtained by perturbing a packing that has the property that the graph of the packing
is a triangulation, which L. Fejes T\'oth called a \emph{compact} packing, and we call a \emph{triangulated}
packing. Previously all of L. Fejes T\'oth's packings that had a density greater than $\pi/\sqrt{12}$
and $q > 0.35$ were based on perturbations of packings with just two sizes of disks, where the graphs
of the packings were triangulations. Our new packings are based on a triangulated packing that have
three distinct sizes of disks, found by Fernique, Hashemi, and Sizova, \cite{1808.10677}, which
is something of a surprise. We also point out how the symmetries of a triangulated doubly periodic
packing can by used to create the actual packing that is guaranteed by a famous result of Thurston,
Andreev, and Andreeson \cite{MR2131318}.
