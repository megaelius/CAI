The total influence of a function is a central notion in analysis of Boolean functions, and characterizing
functions that have small total influence is one of the most fundamental questions associated with
it. The KKL theorem and the Friedgut junta theorem give a strong characterization of such functions
whenever the bound on the total influence is $o(\log n)$. However, both results become useless when
the total influence of the function is $\omega(\log n)$. The only case in which this logarithmic
barrier has been broken for an interesting class of functions was proved by Bourgain and Kalai, who
focused on functions that are symmetric under large enough subgroups of $S_n$. In this paper, we
build and improve on the techniques of the Bourgain-Kalai paper and establish new concentration
results on the Fourier spectrum of Boolean functions with small total influence. Our results include:
1. A quantitative improvement of the Bourgain--Kalai result regarding the total influence of functions
that are transitively symmetric. 2. A slightly weaker version of the Fourier--Entropy Conjecture
of Friedgut and Kalai. This weaker version implies in particular that the Fourier spectrum of a constant
variance, Boolean function $f$ is concentrated on $2^{O(I[f]\log I[f])}$ characters, improving
an earlier result of Friedgut. Removing the $\log I[f]$ factor would essentially resolve the Fourier--Entropy
Conjecture, as well as settle a conjecture of Mansour regarding the Fourier spectrum of polynomial
size DNF formulas. Our concentration result has new implications in learning theory: it implies
that the class of functions whose total influence is at most $K$ is agnostically learnable in time
$2^{O(K\log K)}$, using membership queries.
