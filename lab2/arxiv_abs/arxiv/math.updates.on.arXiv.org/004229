Exact solutions of the Dirac general relativistic equation (DE) that describe the dynamics of a
massive, electrically charged particle with half-integer spin in the curved spacetime geometry
of an electrically charged, rotating Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter black hole (BH) are investigated.
We first, derive the DE in the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter (KNdS) BH background using a generalised Kinnersley
null tetrad in the Newman-Penrose formalism. In this frame, we prove the separation of the DE into
ordinary differential equations for the radial and angular parts. Under specific transformations
of the independent and dependent variables we prove that the transformed radial equation for a massive
charged spin $\frac{1}{2}$ fermion in the background KNdS BH constitutes a highly non-trivial
generalisation of Heun's equation. Using a Regge-Wheeler-like independent variable we transform
the radial equation in the KNdS background into a Schr\"{o}dinger-like differential equation
and investigate its asymptotic behaviour near the event and cosmological horizons. For a massive
fermion (MF) in the background of a Kerr-Newman (KN) BH we first prove that the radial and angular
equations that result from the separation of DE reduce to the generalised Heun differential equation
(GHE). The local solutions of such GHE are derived and can be described by holomorphic functions
whose power series coefficients are determined by a four-term recurrence relation. Using asymptotic
analysis we derive the solutions for the MF far away from the KN BH and the solutions near the event
horizon . The determination of the separation constant as an eigenvalue problem in the KN background
is investigated. Using the aforementioned four-term recursion formula we prove that in the non-extreme
KN geometry there are no bound states with $\omega^2<\mu^2$, where $\omega$ and $\mu$ are the energy
and mass of the fermion respectively.
