This paper considers the secrecy outage performance of a multiple-relay assisted non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) network over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Two slots are utilized to transmit
signals from the base station to destination. At the first slot, the base station broadcasts the
superposition signal of the two users to all decode-and-forward relays by message mapping strategy.
Then the selected relay transmits superposition signal to the two users via power-domain NOMA technology.
Three relay selection (RS) schemes, i.e., optimal single relay selection (OSRS) scheme, two-step
single relay selection (TSRS) scheme, and optimal dual relay selection (ODRS) scheme, are proposed
and the secrecy outage performance are analyzed. As a benchmark, we also examine the secrecy outage
performance of the NOMA systems with traditional multiple relays combining (TMRC) scheme in which
all the relay that successfully decode signals from the source forward signals to the NOMA users
with equal power. Considering the correlation between the secrecy capacity of two users and different
secrecy requirement for two NOMA users, the closed-form expressions for the security outage probability
(SOP) of the proposed OSRS, TSRS, and ODRS schemes along with the TMRC scheme are derived and validated
via simulations. To get more insights, we also derive the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic
SOP for all the schemes with fixed and dynamic power allocations. Furthermore, the secrecy diversity
order (SDO) of cooperative NOMA systems is obtained. The results demonstrate that our proposed
schemes can significantly enhance the secrecy performance compared to the TMRC scheme and that
all the RS schemes with fixed power allocation obtain zero SDO and the OSRS scheme with dynamic power
allocation obtains the same SDO as TMRC.
