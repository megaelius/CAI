We propose a phase-field theory for enriched continua. To generalize classical phase-field models,
we derive the phase-field gradient theory based on balances of microforces, microtorques, and
mass. We focus on materials where second gradients of the phase field describe long-range interactions.
By considering a nontrivial interaction inside the body, described by a boundary-edge microtraction,
we characterize the existence of a microhypertraction field, a central aspect of this theory. On
surfaces, we define the surface microtraction and the surface-couple microtraction emerging
from internal surface interactions. We explicitly account for the lack of smoothness along a curve
on surfaces enclosing arbitrary parts of the domain. In these rough areas, internal-edge microtractions
appear. We begin our theory by characterizing these tractions. Next, in balancing microforces
and microtorques, we arrive at the field equations. Subject to thermodynamic constraints, we develop
a general set of constitutive relations for a phase-field model where its free-energy density depends
on second gradients of the phase field. A priori, the balance equations are general and independent
of constitutive equations, where the thermodynamics constrain the constitutive relations through
the free-energy imbalance. To exemplify the usefulness of our theory, we generalize two commonly
used phase-field equations. We propose a 'generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation'-a second-grade
phase-field equation-and its conserved version, the 'generalized phase-field crystal equation'-a
conserved second-grade phase-field equation. Furthermore, we derive the configurational fields
arising in this theory. We conclude with the presentation of a comprehensive, thermodynamically
consistent set of boundary conditions.
