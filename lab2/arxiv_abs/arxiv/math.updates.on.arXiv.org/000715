Generalizing our L-Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (L-KS) kernel---introduced earlier---we give a novel
explicit-kernel formulation useful for a large class of fourth order deterministic, stochastic,
linear, and nonlinear PDEs in multispatial dimensions. These include pattern formation equations
like the Swift-Hohenberg (SH) and many other prominent and new PDEs. We establish existence, uniqueness,
and sharp dimension-dependent H\"older regularity for the canonical L-KS SPDE, driven by white
noise on $\{\Rp\times\Rd\}_{d=1}^{3}$. The spatio-temporal H\"older exponents are exactly
the same as the striking ones we proved for our recently introduced Brownian-time Brownian motion
(BTBM) stochastic integral equation---linked to totally different time-fractional, memoryful,
and positive biLaplacian fourth order PDEs. From our recent results, the spatial H\"older regularity
interval length and the third dimension random field limit are maximal for spatially-high order
equations driven by white noise. The challenge in establishing our H\"older exponents is that,
unlike the positive BTBM density, the L-KS kernel is the Gaussian average of a highly oscillatory
complex modified Schr\"odinger propagator. Thus, we modify our BTBM methods by using a combination
of harmonic and delicate analysis, including adaptations of our BTBM techniques, to get the necessary
estimates. Attaching order parameters to the L-KS spatial operator and the noise term, we give a
critical dimension-dependent order parameters ratio that controls the limiting interaction
between the two opposing forces. Finally, we give a change-of-measure equivalence between the
canonical L-KS SPDE and nonlinear L-KS SPDEs on $\{\Rp\times\Rd\}_{d=1}^{3}$ and subsets thereof.
In particular, we prove the law equivalence of the SH SPDE and the canonical L-KS SPDE on compact subsets.
Hence, all these equations have the same regularity..
