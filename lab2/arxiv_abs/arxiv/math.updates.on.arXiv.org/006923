Finding latent structures in data is drawing increasing attention in broad and diverse fields such
as fluid dynamics, signal processing, and machine learning. In this work, we formulate \acf{DMD}
for two types of dynamical system. The first, a system which is derived by a $\gamma$-homogeneous
operator ($\gamma\neq 1$). The second, a system which can be represented as a symmetric operator.
Regarding to the first type, dynamical systems, derived by $\gamma$-homogeneous operators $\gamma\in[0,1)$,
reach the steady state in finite time. This inherently contradicts the Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) model, which can be seen as an exponential data fitting algorithm. Therefore, the induced
\ac{DMD} operator leads to artifacts in the decomposition. We show certain cases where the DMD does
not even exist. For homogeneous systems ($\gamma\neq 1$), we suggest a time rescaling that solves
this conflict and show that DMD can perfectly restore the dynamics even for nonlinear flows. For
dynamics which derived by a symmetric operator, we expect the eigenvalues of the DMD to be real. This
requirement is embeded in a variant of the DMD algorithm, termed as Symmetric DMD (SDMD). With these
adaptations, we formulate a closed form solution of DMD for dynamics $u_t = P(u) $, $u(t=0)=u_0$,
where $P$ is a nonlinear $\gamma$-homogeneous operator, when the initial condition $u_0$ admits
the nonlinear eigenvalue problem $P(u_0)=\lambda u_0 $ ($u_0$ is a nonlinear eigenfunction, with
respect to the operator $P$). We show experimentally that, for such systems, for any initial condition,
SDMD achieves lower mean square error for the spectrum estimation. Finally, we formulate a discrete
decomposition, related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of $\gamma$-homogeneous operator.
