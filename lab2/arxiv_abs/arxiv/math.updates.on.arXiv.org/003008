The low-temperature regime of charge-qubit decoherence due to its Coulomb interaction with electrons
tunneling through Luttinger liquid quantum-point contact (QPC) is investigated. The study is
focused on quantum detector properties of Luttinger liquid QPC. It is shown, that in low-temperature
limit the respective perturbative decoherence- and acquisition of information timescales both
tend to diverge, thus, shadowing a true picture of low-temperature quantum detection for such quantum
systems. Here I prove two general mathematical statements (S-theorem and S-lemma) about exact
re-exponentiation of Keldysh-contour ordered T-exponent for arbitrary Luttinger liquid tunnel
Hamiltonian. As the result, decoherence- and acquisition of information time-scales as well as
QPC quantum detector efficiency rate are calculated exactly and are shown to have a dramatic dependence
on repulsive interaction between electrons in 1D leads of QPC. Discovered abrupt decrease of QPC
quantum detector efficiency $ Q $ with the increase of $ g $ in the close vicinity of value $ g_{cr}(T)
$ represents a fingerprint of interaction-dependent instability of all the quantum detection
procedure for any Luttinger liquid QPC quantum detector at definite low enough temperatures $ T_{cr}(g)
$. The reasons behind these effects are discussed. Also, it is shown that such the low-temperature
detection instability effect is able to explain a large unclear mismatch between expected and observed
decoherence timescales in two well-known experiments (J.Gorman, D.G.Hasko, D.A.Williams, Phys.Rev.Lett.,
