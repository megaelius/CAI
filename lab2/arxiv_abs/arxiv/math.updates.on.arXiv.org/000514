We study the record statistics of random walks after $n$ steps, $x_0, x_1,\ldots, x_n$, with arbitrary
symmetric and continuous distribution $p(\eta)$ of the jumps $\eta_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$. We consider
the age of the records, i.e. the time up to which a record survives. Depending on how the age of the current
last record is defined, we propose three distinct sequences of ages (indexed by $\alpha$ = I, II,
III) associated to a given sequence of records. We then focus on the longest lasting record, which
is the longest element among this sequence of ages. To characterize the statistics of these longest
lasting records, we compute: (i) the probability that the record of the longest age is broken at step
$n$, denoted by $Q^{\alpha}(n)$, which we call the probability of record breaking and: (ii) the
duration of the longest lasting record, $\ell_{\max}^{\alpha}(n)$. We show that both $Q^{\alpha}(n)$
and the full statistics of $\ell_{\max}^{\alpha}(n)$ are universal, i.e. independent of the jump
distribution $p(\eta)$. We compute exactly the large $n$ asymptotic behaviors of $Q^{\alpha}(n)$
as well as $\langle \ell_{\max}^{\alpha}(n)\rangle$ (when it exists) and show that each case gives
rise to a different universal constant associated to random walks (including L\'evy flights).
While two of them appeared before in the excursion theory of Brownian motion, for which we provide
here a simpler derivation, the third case gives rise to a non-trivial new constant $C^{\rm III} =
0.241749 \ldots$ associated to the records of random walks. Other observables characterizing
the ages of the records, exhibiting an interesting universal behavior, are also discussed.
