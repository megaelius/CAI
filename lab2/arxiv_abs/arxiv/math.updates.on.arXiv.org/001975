Stochastic integration with respect to Gaussian processes, such as fractional Brownian motion
(fBm) or multifractional Brownian motion (mBm), has raised strong interest in recent years, motivated
in particular by applications in finance, Internet traffic modeling and biomedicine. The aim of
this work to define and develop, using White Noise Theory, an anticipative stochastic calculus
with respect to a large class of Gaussian processes, denoted G, that contains, among many other processes,
Volterra processes (and thus fBm) and also mBm. This stochastic calculus includes a definition
of a stochastic integral, It\^o formulas (both for tempered distributions and for functions with
sub-exponential growth), a Tanaka Formula as well as a definition, and a short study, of (both weighted
and non weighted) local times of elements of G . In that view, a white noise derivative of any Gaussian
process G of G is defined and used to integrate, with respect to G, a large class of stochastic processes,
using Wick products. A comparison of our integral wrt elements of G to the ones provided by Malliavin
calculus in [AMN01] and by It\^o stochastic calculus is also made. Moreover, one shows that the stochastic
calculus with respect to Gaussian processes provided in this work generalizes the stochastic calculus
originally proposed for fBm in [EVdH03, BS{\O}W04, Ben03a] and for mBm in [LLV14, Leb13, LLVH14].
Likewise, it generalizes results given in [NT06] and some results given in [AMN01]. In addition,
it offers alternative conditions to the ones required in [AMN01] when one deals with stochastic
calculus with respect to Gaussian processes.
