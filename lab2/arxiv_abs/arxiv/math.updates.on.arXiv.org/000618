This paper presents algorithms that relate to the problem of finding a minimum-cost sum-of-primes
representation of a Boolean function f when the cost function C is positive and additive. A set of
primes whose sum equals f is called a basis for f, so a solution to the problem is a minimum-cost basis.
The algorithms prove the existence of the following canonical partition of the complete set of primes.
(1) Essential Primes, which must be part of any basis for f, (2) Unnecessary Primes that cannot be
part of a minimum-cost basis for f for any positive additive cost function, (3) Unique disjoint sets
of primes, PS1,...,PSN with associated "covering" tables TS1,..., TSN such that any minimum-cost
basis consists of the union of the sets Essential Primes, QS1(C), ..., QSN(C) where QSi(C) is contained
in PSi and QSi(C) is a minimum-cost "cover" for PSi. Covering is defined by operation Cascade(QS,
TS), which has the property that QS covers PS if and only if Cascade(QS, TS) is empty. The key to the
results is the study of objects called Ancestor Sets. The Ancestor Theorem proves that if A is an Ancestor
Set for f, every minimum-cost basis includes a minimum-cost cover for the set of primes PS in Ancestor
Set A and a minimum-cost cover for the set of primes that are not in A (and are not covered by the the union
of the Essentials with PS). The PSi in the partition are the sets of primes in canonical Independent
Ancestor Sets Ai, which are easy to generate when the calculation of the primes (and their consensus
combinations) is within computational scope. The paper also presents a condition under which QSi(C)
can be easily determined, and another condition such that PSi can be broken into disjoint pieces
that can be minimized separately.
