The modeling of atmospheric processes in the context of weather and climate simulations is an important
and computationally expensive challenge. The temporal integration of the underlying PDEs requires
a very large number of time steps, even when the terms accounting for the propagation of fast atmospheric
waves are treated implicitly. Therefore, the use of parallel-in-time integration schemes to reduce
the time-to-solution is of increasing interest, particularly in the numerical weather forecasting
field. We propose a multi-level parallel-in-time integration method combining the Parallel Full
Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) with a spatial discretization based on Spherical
Harmonics (SH). This iterative algorithm computes multiple time steps concurrently by interweaving
parallel high-order fine corrections and serial corrections performed on a coarsened problem
to propagate the updated initial conditions between time steps. We design a methodology to coarsen
and interpolate the problem in space using the spectral basis of the SH that is key for the accuracy
and efficiency of the approach. The proposed methods are evaluated on the shallow-water equations
on the rotating sphere using a set of tests commonly used in the atmospheric flow community and characterized
by the fast generation of small-scale features in the solution. We assess the convergence of PFASST-SH
upon refinement in time to investigate the impact of the coarsening strategy on the accuracy of the
scheme, and specifically on its ability to capture the high-frequency modes accumulating in the
solution. We also study the computational cost of PFASST-SH to demonstrate that our scheme can resolve
the main features of the solution multiple times faster than the serial schemes and to illustrate
the scalability of the approach.
