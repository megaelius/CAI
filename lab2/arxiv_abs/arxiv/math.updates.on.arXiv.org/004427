We present an error analysis and further numerical investigations of the Parameterized-Background
Data-Weak (PBDW) formulation to variational Data Assimilation (state estimation), proposed
in [Y Maday, AT Patera, JD Penn, M Yano, Int J Numer Meth Eng, 102(5), 933-965]. The PBDW algorithm
is a state estimation method involving reduced models. It aims at approximating an unknown function
$u^{\rm true}$ living in a high-dimensional Hilbert space from $M$ measurement observations given
in the form $y_m = \ell_m(u^{\rm true}),\, m=1,\dots,M$, where $\ell_m$ are linear functionals.
The method approximates $u^{\rm true}$ with $\hat{u} = \hat{z} + \hat{\eta}$. The \emph{background}
$\hat{z}$ belongs to an $N$-dimensional linear space $\mathcal{Z}_N$ built from reduced modelling
of a parameterized mathematical model, and the \emph{update} $\hat{\eta}$ belongs to the space
$\mathcal{U}_M$ spanned by the Riesz representers of $(\ell_1,\dots, \ell_M)$. When the measurements
are noisy {--- i.e., $y_m = \ell_m(u^{\rm true})+\epsilon_m$ with $\epsilon_m$ being a noise term
--- } the classical PBDW formulation is not robust in the sense that, if $N$ increases, the reconstruction
accuracy degrades. In this paper, we propose to address this issue with an extension of the classical
formulation, {which consists in} searching for the background $\hat{z}$ either on the whole $\mathcal{Z}_N$
in the noise-free case, or on a well-chosen subset $\mathcal{K}_N \subset \mathcal{Z}_N$ in presence
of noise. The restriction to $\mathcal{K}_N$ makes the reconstruction be nonlinear and is the key
to make the algorithm significantly more robust against noise. We {further} present an \emph{a
priori} error and stability analysis, and we illustrate the efficiency of the approach on several
numerical examples.
