We compute lattice correlation functions for the model of critical dense polymers on a semi-infinite
cylinder of perimeter $n$. In the lattice loop model, contractible loops have a vanishing fugacity
whereas non-contractible loops have a fugacity $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. These correlators are
defined as ratios $Z(x)/Z_0$ of partition functions, where $Z_0$ is a reference partition function
wherein only simple arcs are attached to the boundary of the cylinder. For $Z(x)$, the boundary is
also decorated with simple arcs, but it also has two positions $1$ and $x$ where the boundary condition
is different. We investigate two such kinds of boundary conditions: (i) there is a single node at
each of these points where a long arc is attached, and (ii) there are pairs of adjacent nodes at these
points where two long arcs are attached. We find explicit expressions for these correlators for
finite $n$ using the representation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra in the XX spin
chain. The resulting asymptotics as $n\to\infty$ are expressed as simple integrals that depend
on the parameter $\tau=\frac{x-1}n\in(0,1)$. For small $\tau$, the leading behaviours are proportional
to $\tau^{1/4}$, $\tau^{1/4}\log \tau$, $\log\tau$ and $\log^2\tau$. We interpret the lattice
results in terms of ratios of conformal correlation functions. We assume that the corresponding
boundary changing fields are highest weight states in irreducible, Kac or staggered Virasoro modules,
with central charge $c=-2$ and conformal dimensions $\Delta = -\frac18$ or $\Delta=0$. We obtain
differential equations satisfied by the conformal correlators, solve these equations, and find
a perfect agreement with the lattice results. We compute structure constants and ratios thereof
which appear in the operator product expansions of the boundary condition changing fields. The
fusion of these fields is found to be non-abelian.
