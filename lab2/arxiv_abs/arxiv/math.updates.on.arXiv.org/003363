Consider a control problem with a communication channel connecting the observer of a linear stochastic
system to the controller. The goal of the controller is to minimize a quadratic cost function in the
state variables and control signal, known as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). We study the
fundamental tradeoff between the communication rate $r$ bits/sec and the expected cost $b$. We
obtain a lower bound on a certain rate-cost function, which quantifies the minimum directed mutual
information between the channel input and output that is compatible with a target LQR cost. The rate-cost
function has operational significance in multiple scenarios of interest: among others, it allows
us to lower-bound the minimum communication rate for fixed and variable length quantization, and
for control over noisy channels. We derive an explicit lower bound to the rate-cost function, which
applies to the vector, non-Gaussian, and partially observed systems, thereby extending and generalizing
an earlier explicit expression for the scalar Gaussian system, due to Tatikonda el al. The bound
applies as long as the differential entropy of the system noise is not $-\infty$. It can be closely
approached by a simple lattice quantization scheme that only quantizes the innovation, that is,
the difference between the controller's belief about the current state and the true state. Via a
separation principle between control and communication, similar results hold for causal lossy
compression of additive noise Markov sources. Apart from standard dynamic programming arguments,
our technical approach leverages the Shannon lower bound, develops new estimates for data compression
with coding memory, and uses some recent results on high resolution variable-length vector quantization
to prove that the new converse bounds are tight.
