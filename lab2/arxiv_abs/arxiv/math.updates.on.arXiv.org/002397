The $n^{th}$ cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_n(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of an $n^{th}$ primitive
root of unity. Its coefficients are the subject of intensive study and some formulas are known for
them. Here we are interested in formulas which are valid for all natural numbers $n$. In these a host
of famous number theoretical objects such as Bernoulli numbers, Stirling numbers of both kinds
and Ramanujan sums make their appearance, sometimes even at the same time! In this paper we present
a survey of these formulas which until now were scattered in the literature and introduce an unified
approach to derive them, leading also to shorter proofs as a by product. In particular, we show that
some of the formulas have a more elegant reinterpretation in terms of Bell polynomials. This approach
amounts to computing the logarithmic derivatives of $\Phi_n$ at certain points. Furthermore,
we show that the logarithmic derivatives at $\pm 1$ of any Kronecker polynomial (a monic product
of cyclotomic polynomials and a monomial) satisfy a family of linear equations whose coefficients
are Stirling numbers of the second kind. We apply these equations to show that certain polynomials
are not Kronecker. In particular, we infer that for every $k\ge 4$ there exists a symmetric numerical
semigroup with embedding dimension $k$ and Frobenius number $2k+1$ that is not cyclotomic, thus
establishing a conjecture of Alexandru Ciolan, Pedro Garc\'ia-S\'anchez and the second author.
In an appendix Pedro Garc\'ia-S\'anchez shows that for every $k\ge 4$ there exists a symmetric non-cyclotomic
numerical semigroup having Frobenius number $2k+1.$
