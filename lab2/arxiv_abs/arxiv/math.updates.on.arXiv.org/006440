The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already created emergency situations in almost every
country of the world. The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after
its first identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks starts on $2^{nd}$
March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density,
the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission
mechanism of the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical
models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention
strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe
the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We consider the initial phase of the
outbreak situation in India and our proposed model is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported
cases during the period $2^{nd}$ March, 2020 to $24^{th}$ March, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction
number $(R_0)$, effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic doubling time from the incidence
data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of preventive measures such as
spread of awareness, lock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two intervention
scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period
of implementation. Our study suggests that higher intervention effort is required to control the
disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the
strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.
