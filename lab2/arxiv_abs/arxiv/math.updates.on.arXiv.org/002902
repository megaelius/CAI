We present methods for bounding infinite-time averages in dynamical systems governed by nonlinear
PDEs. The methods rely on auxiliary functionals, which are similar to Lyapunov functionals but
satisfy different inequalities. The inequalities are enforced by requiring certain expressions
to be sums of squares of polynomials, and the optimal choice of auxiliary functional is posed as a
semidefinite program (SDP) that can be solved computationally. To formulate these SDPs we approximate
the PDE by truncated systems of ODEs and proceed in one of two ways. The first approach is to compute
bounds for the ODE systems, increasing the truncation order until bounds converge numerically.
The second approach incorporates the ODE systems with analytical estimates on their deviation
from the PDE, thereby using finite truncations to produce bounds for the full PDE. We apply both methods
to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where we compute upper bounds on the spatiotemporal average
of energy by employing polynomial auxiliary functionals up to degree six. The first approach is
used for most computations, but a subset of results are checked using the second approach, and the
results agree to high precision. These bounds apply to all odd solutions of period $2\pi L$, where
$L$ is varied. Sharp bounds are obtained for $L\le10$, and trends suggest that more expensive computations
would yield sharp bounds at larger $L$ also. The bounds are known to be sharp (to within 0.1% numerical
error) because they are saturated by the simplest nonzero steady states, which apparently have
the largest mean energy among all odd solutions. Prior authors have conjectured that mean energy
remains $O(1)$ for $L\gg1$ since no particular solutions with larger energy have been found. Our
bounds constitute the first positive evidence for this conjecture, albeit up to finite $L$, and
they offer some guidance for analytical proofs.
