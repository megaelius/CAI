We propose a nonlocal optimization method for inverse design in nanophotonics. Existing local-gradient-based
optimization approaches lack nonlocal exploration ability required for escaping from local minima
in non-convex landscapes. A nonlocal gradient operator using directional Gaussian smoothing
(DGS) is proposed to address this challenge in photonics device design. Compared with the local
gradient, the DGS gradient allows for a large smoothing radius to capture the global structure of
loss landscapes. A deterministic Gauss-Hermite quadrature is used to develop a DGS gradient estimator
with higher accuracy than Monte Carlo estimators. The nonlocal optimization method using DGS gradient
has its advantages on portability and flexibility to naturally incorporate the parameterization,
physics simulation, and objective formulation together to builds up an effective inverse design
workflow. An adaptive smoothing radius and learning rate with quadratic decay are proposed to improve
robustness and convergence within the DGS gradient optimization. To enable a clear binarized design,
a dynamic growth mechanism is imposed on the projection strength in parameterization. The proposed
methodology is demonstrated by an example of wavelength demultiplexer. Our method shows superior
performance with faster convergence compared with classical approaches. Given varying initialization
with Gaussian random noise, the optimized design using the nonlocal DGS gradient demonstrates
high robustness and low uncertainty. By incorporating volume constraints into optimization,
the optimized design using the nonlocal method achieves an equivalently high performance but significantly
reduces the amount of material usage in wavelength demultiplexer design.
