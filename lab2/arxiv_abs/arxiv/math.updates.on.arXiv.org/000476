We address the problem of joint sparsity pattern recovery based on low dimensional multiple measurement
vectors (MMVs) in resource constrained distributed networks. We assume that distributed nodes
observe sparse signals which share the same sparsity pattern and each node obtains measurements
via a low dimensional linear operator. When the measurements are collected at distributed nodes
in a communication network, it is often required that joint sparse recovery be performed under inherent
resource constraints such as communication bandwidth and transmit/processing power. We present
two approaches to take the communication constraints into account while performing common sparsity
pattern recovery. First, we explore the use of a shared multiple access channel (MAC) in forwarding
observations residing at each node to a fusion center. With MAC, while the bandwidth requirement
does not depend on the number of nodes, the fusion center has access to only a linear combination of
the observations. We discuss the conditions under which the common sparsity pattern can be estimated
reliably. Second, we develop two collaborative algorithms based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
(OMP), to jointly estimate the common sparsity pattern in a decentralized manner with a low communication
overhead. In the proposed algorithms, each node exploits collaboration among neighboring nodes
by sharing a small amount of information for fusion at different stages in estimating the indices
of the true support in a greedy manner. Efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
are demonstrated via simulations along with a comparison with the most related existing algorithms
considering the trade-off between the performance gain and the communication overhead.
