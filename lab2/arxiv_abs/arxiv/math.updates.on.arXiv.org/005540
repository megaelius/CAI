We investigate how the motive of hyper-K\"ahler varieties is controlled by weight-2 (or surface-like)
motives via tensor operations. In the first part, we study the Voevodsky motive of singular moduli
spaces of semistable sheaves on K3 and abelian surfaces as well as the Chow motive of their crepant
resolutions, when they exist. We show that these motives are in the tensor subcategory generated
by the motive of the surface, provided that a crepant resolution exists. This extends a recent result
of B\"ulles to the O'Grady-10 situation. In the non-commutative setting, similar results are proved
for the Chow motive of moduli spaces of stable objects of the K3 category of a cubic fourfold. As a consequence,
we provide abundant examples of hyper-K\"ahler varieties of O'Grady-10 deformation type satisfying
the standard conjectures. In the second part, we study the Andr\'{e} motive of projective hyper-K\"ahler
varieties. We attach to any such variety its defect group, an algebraic group which acts on the cohomology
and measures the difference between the full motive and its weight-2 part. When the second Betti
number is not 3, we show that the defect group is a natural complement of the Mumford--Tate group inside
the motivic Galois group, and that it is deformation invariant. We prove the triviality of this group
for all known examples of projective hyper-K\"ahler varieties, so that in each case the full motive
is controlled by its weight-2 part. As applications, we show that for any variety motivated by a product
of known hyper-K\"ahler varieties, all Hodge and Tate classes are motivated, the motivated Mumford--Tate
conjecture holds, and the Andr\'e motive is abelian. This last point completes a recent work of Soldatenkov
and provides a different proof for some of his results.
