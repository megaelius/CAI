This is the first and main paper of a two-part series, in which we prove the $C^{2}$-formulation of
the strong cosmic censorship conjecture for the Einstein-Maxwell-(real)-scalar-field system
in spherical symmetry for two-ended asymptotically flat data. For this model, it is known through
the works of Dafermos and Dafermos-Rodnianski that the maximal globally hyperbolic future development
of any admissible two-ended asymptotically flat Cauchy initial data set possesses a non-empty
Cauchy horizon, across which the spacetime is $C^{0}$-future-extendible (in particular, the
$C^{0}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture is false). Nevertheless, the
main conclusion of the present series of papers is that for a generic (in the sense of being open and
dense relative to appropriate topologies) class of such data, the spacetime is future-inextendible
with a Lorentzian metric of higher regularity (specifically, $C^{2}$). In this paper, we prove
that the solution is $C^{2}$-future-inextendible under the condition that the scalar field obeys
an $L^{2}$-averaged polynomial lower bound along each of the event horizons. This, in particular,
improves upon a previous result of Dafermos, which required instead a pointwise lower bound. Key
to the proof are appropriate stability and instability results in the interior of the black hole
region, whose proofs are in turn based on ideas from the work of Dafermos-Luk on the stability of the
Kerr Cauchy horizon (without symmetry) and from our previous paper on linear instability of Reissner-Nordstr\"om
Cauchy horizon. In the second paper of the series (arXiv:1702.05716), which concerns analysis
in the exterior of the black hole region, we show that the $L^2$-averaged polynomial lower bound
needed for the instability result indeed holds for a generic class of admissible two-ended asymptotically
flat Cauchy initial data.
