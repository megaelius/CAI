The two-dimensional directed spanning forest (DSF) introduced by Baccelli and Bordenave is a planar
directed tree whose set of vertices is a homogeneous Poisson point process ${\cal N}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
If the DSF has direction $-e_y$, the ancestor $h(\mathbf{u})$ of a vertex $\mathbf{u} \in {\cal
N}$ is the nearest Poisson point (in the $L^2$ distance) having strictly larger $y$-coordinate.
In this paper we show that when properly scaled, the family of its paths converges in distribution
to the Brownian web (BW). This verifies a conjecture made by Baccelli and Bordenave in 2007. A key
ingredient for the proof is to control the tail distribution of the coalescing time between two paths
of the DSF. The facts that the DSF spans on a Poisson point process on the plane and that its construction
is based on the $L^2$ distance - which is very natural - destroys all Markov and martingale properties
on which the existing literature usually relies for proving convergence of directed forests to
the Brownian web. The proof relies on the construction of clever regeneration events exploiting
the particular geometry of the DSF. The distance between the two paths considered at the corresponding
regeneration times is Markov, and we can control its hitting time of zero by a new Laplace criterion.
We then introduce a new criterion for the convergence to the BW, that is inspired from the wedge condition
of Schertzer et al. (2017) and Roy et al. (2016), and show that it is satisfied. We believe that the
ideas in this work can be applied to the convergence to he BW of a large variety of directed forests
with intricate dependencies...
