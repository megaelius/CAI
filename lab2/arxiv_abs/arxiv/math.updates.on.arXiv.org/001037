We discuss an elementary method for the evaluation of the convolution sums $\underset{\substack{
{(l,m)\in\mathbb{N}_{0}^{2}} \\ {\alpha\,l+\beta\,m=n} } }{\sum}\sigma(l)\sigma(m)$ for
those $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{N}$ for which $\gcd{(\alpha,\beta)}=1$ and $\alpha\beta=2^{\nu}\mho$,
where $\nu\in\{0,1,2,3\}$ and $\mho$ is a finite product of distinct odd primes. Modular forms
are used to achieve this result. We also generalize the extraction of the convolution sum to all natural
numbers. Formulae for the number of representations of a positive integer $n$ by octonary quadratic
forms using convolution sums belonging to this class are then determined when $\alpha\beta\equiv
0\pmod{4}$ or $\alpha\beta\equiv 0\pmod{3}$. To achieve this application, we first discuss a
method to compute all pairs $(a,b),(c,d)\in\mathbb{N}^{2}$ necessary for the determination
of such formulae for the number of representations of a positive integer $n$ by octonary quadratic
forms when $\alpha\beta$ has the above form and $\alpha\beta\equiv 0\pmod{4}$ or $\alpha\beta\equiv
0\pmod{3}$. We illustrate our approach by explicitly evaluating the convolution sum for $\alpha\beta=33=3\cdot
11,\> \alpha\beta=40=2^{3}\cdot 5$ and $\alpha\beta=56=2^{3}\cdot 7$, and by revisiting the
evaluation of the convolution sums for $\alpha\beta=10$, $11$, $12$, $15$, $24$. We then apply
these convolution sums to determine formulae for the number of representations of a positive integer
$n$ by octonary quadratic forms. In addition, we determine formulae for the number of representations
of a positive integer $n$ when $(a,b)=(1,1)$, $(1,3)$, $(2,3)$, $(1,9)$.
