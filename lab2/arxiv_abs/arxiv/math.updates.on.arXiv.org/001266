This is the third part of a four-paper sequence, which establishes the Threshold Conjecture and
the Soliton-Bubbling vs.~Scattering Dichotomy for the energy critical hyperbolic Yang--Mills
equation in the $(4+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space-time. This paper provides basic tools for
considering the dynamics of the hyperbolic Yang--Mills equation in an arbitrary topological class
at an optimal regularity. We generalize the standard notion of a topological class of connections
on $\mathbb R^{d}$, defined via a pullback to the one-point compactification $\mathbb S^{d} = \mathbb
R^{d} \cup \{\infty\}$, to rough connections with curvature in the critical space $L^{\frac{d}{2}}(\mathbb
R^{d})$. Moreover, we provide excision and extension techniques for the Yang--Mills constraint
(or Gauss) equation, which allow us to efficiently localize Yang--Mills initial data sets. Combined
with the results in the previous paper \cite{OTYM2}, we obtain local well-posedness of the hyperbolic
Yang--Mills equation on $\mathbb R^{1+d}$ $(d \geq 4)$ in an arbitrary topological class at optimal
regularity in the temporal gauge (where finite speed of propagation holds). In addition, in the
energy subcritical case $d = 3$, our techniques provide an alternative proof of the classical finite
energy global well-posedness theorem of Klainerman--Machedon \cite{KlMa2}, while also removing
the smallness assumption in the temporal-gauge local well-posedness theorem of Tao \cite{TaoYM}.
Although this paper is a part of a larger sequence, the materials presented in this paper may be of
independent and general interest. For this reason, we have organized the paper so that it may be read
separately from the sequence.
