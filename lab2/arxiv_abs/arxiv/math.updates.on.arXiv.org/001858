For the one-stage third-order gas-kinetic scheme (GKS), success applications have been achieved
for the three-dimensional compressible flow computations [33]. The high-order accuracy of the
scheme is obtained directly by integrating a multidimensional time-accurate gas distribution
function over the cell interface within a time step without implementing Gaussian quadrature points
and Runge-Kutta time-stepping technique. However, for the further increasing the order of the
scheme, such as the fourth-order one, the formulation becomes very complicated for the multidimensional
flow. Recently, a two-stage fourth-order GKS with high efficiency has been constructed for two-dimensional
inviscid and viscous flow computations [22,32], and the scheme uses the time accurate flux function
and its time derivatives. In this paper, a fourth-order GKS is developed for the threedimensional
flows under the two-stage framework. Based on the three-dimensional WENO reconstruction and flux
evaluation at Gaussian quadrature points on a cell interface, the high-order accuracy in space
is achieved first. Then, the two-stage time stepping method provides the high accuracy in time.
In comparison with the formal third-order GKS [33], the current fourth-order method not only improves
the accuracy of the scheme, but also reduces the complexity of the gas-kinetic solver greatly. More
importantly, the fourth-order GKS has the same robustness as the second-order shock capturing
scheme. This scheme is applied to both inviscid and viscous, and low and high speed flow computations.
Numerical results validate the outstanding reliability and applicability of the scheme for three-dimensional
flows, such as turbulent one.
