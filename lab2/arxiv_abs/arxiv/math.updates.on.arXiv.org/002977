The problem of detecting changes with multiple sensors has received significant attention in the
literature. In many practical applications such as critical infrastructure monitoring and modeling
of disease spread, a useful change propagation model is one where change eventually happens at all
sensors, but where not all sensors witness change at the same time instant. While prior work considered
the case of known change propagation dynamics, this paper studies a more general setting of unknown
change propagation pattern (trajectory). A Bayesian formulation of the problem in both centralized
and decentralized settings is studied with the goal of detecting the first time instant at which
any sensor witnesses a change. Using the dynamic programming (DP) framework, the optimal solution
structure is derived and in the rare change regime, several more practical change detection algorithms
are proposed. Under certain conditions, the first-order asymptotic optimality of a proposed algorithm
called multichart test is shown as the false alarm probability vanishes. To further reduce the computational
complexity, change detection algorithms are proposed based on online estimation of the unknown
change propagation pattern. Numerical studies illustrate that the proposed detection techniques
offer near-optimal performance. Further, in the decentralized setting, it is shown that if an event-triggered
sampling scheme called level-crossing sampling with hysteresis (LCSH) is used for sampling and
transmission of local statistics, the detection performance can be significantly improved using
the same amount of communication resources compared to the conventional uniform-in-time sampling
(US) scheme.
