We study the geometric Whitney problem on how a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ can be constructed to
approximate a metric space $(X,d_X)$. This problem is closely related to manifold reconstruction
where a smooth $n$-dimensional submanifold $S\subset {\mathbb R}^m$, $m>n$ needs to be constructed
to approximate a point cloud in ${\mathbb R}^m$. These questions are encountered in differential
geometry, machine learning, and in many inverse problems encountered in applications. The determination
of a Riemannian manifold includes the construction of its topology, differentiable structure,
and metric. We give constructive solutions to the above problems. Moreover, we characterize the
metric spaces that can be approximated, by Riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry: We give
sufficient conditions to ensure that a metric space can be approximated, in the Gromov-Hausdorff
or quasi-isometric sense, by a Riemannian manifold of a fixed dimension and with bounded diameter,
sectional curvature, and injectivity radius. Also, we show that similar conditions, with modified
values of parameters, are necessary. As an application of the main results we give a new characterisation
of Alexandrov spaces with two-sided curvature bounds. Moreover, we characterise the subsets of
Euclidean spaces that can be approximated in the Hausdorff metric by submanifolds of a fixed dimension
and with bounded principal curvatures and normal injectivity radius. We develop algorithmic procedures
that solve the geometric Whitney problem for a metric space and the manifold reconstruction problem
in Euclidean space, and estimate the computational complexity of these procedures.
