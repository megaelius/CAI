In this paper, we consider the problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Einstein field
equations for a spatially flat FLRW universe in the context of stochastic eternal inflation where
the stochastic mechanism is modelled by adding a stochastic forcing term representing Gaussian
white noise to the Klein-Gordon equation. We show that under these considerations, the Klein-Gordon
equation actually becomes a stochastic differential equation. Therefore, the existence and uniqueness
of solutions to Einstein's equations depend on whether the coefficients of this stochastic differential
equation obey Lipschitz continuity conditions. We show that for any choice of $V(\phi)$, the Einstein
field equations are not globally well-posed, hence, any solution found to these equations is not
guaranteed to be unique. Instead, the coefficients are at best locally Lipschitz continuous in
the physical state space of the dynamical variables, which only exist up to a finite explosion time.
We further perform Feller's explosion test for an arbitrary power-law inflaton potential and prove
that all solutions to the EFE explode in a finite time with probability one. This implies that the
mechanism of stochastic inflation thus considered cannot be described to be eternal, since the
very concept of eternal inflation implies that the process continues indefinitely. We therefore
argue that stochastic inflation based on a stochastic forcing term would not produce an infinite
number of universes in some multiverse ensemble. In general, since the Einstein field equations
in both situations are not well-posed, we further conclude that the existence of a multiverse via
the stochastic eternal inflation mechanism considered in this paper is still very much an open question
that will require much deeper investigation.
