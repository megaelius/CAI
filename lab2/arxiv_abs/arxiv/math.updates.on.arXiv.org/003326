The absolute upper bound on the number of equiangular lines that can be found in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is
$d(d+1)/2$. Examples of sets of lines that saturate this bound are only known to exist in dimensions
$d=2,3,7$ or $23$. By considering the additional property of incoherence, we prove that there exists
a set of equiangular lines that saturates the absolute bound and the incoherence bound if and only
if $d=2,3,7$ or $23$. This allows us classify all tight spherical $5$-designs $X$ in $\mathbf{S}^{d-1}$,
the unit sphere, with the property that there exists a set of $d$ points in $X$ whose pairwise inner
products are positive. For a given angle $\kappa$, there exists a relative upper bound on the number
of equiangular lines in $\mathbf{R}^d$ with common angle $\kappa$. We prove that classifying sets
of lines that saturate this bound along with the incoherence bound is equivalent to classifying
certain quasi-symmetric designs, which are combinatorial designs with two block intersection
numbers. Given a further natural assumption, we classify the known sets of lines that saturate these
two bounds. This family comprises of the lines mentioned above and the maximal set of $16$ equiangular
lines found in $\mathbf{R}^6$. There are infinitely many known sets of lines that saturate the relative
bound, so this result is surprising. To shed some light on this, we identify the $E_8$ lattice with
the projection onto an $8$-dimensional subspace of a sublattice of the Leech lattice defined by
$276$ equiangular lines in $\mathbf{R}^{23}$. This identification leads us to observe a correspondence
between sets of equiangular lines in small dimensions and the exceptional curves of del Pezzo surfaces.
