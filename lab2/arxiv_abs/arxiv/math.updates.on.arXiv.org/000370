This paper discusses a methodology for determining a functional representation of a random process
from a collection of scattered pointwise samples. The present work specifically focuses onto random
quantities lying in a high dimensional stochastic space in the context of limited amount of information.
The proposed approach involves a procedure for the selection of an approximation basis and the evaluation
of the associated coefficients. The selection of the approximation basis relies on the a priori
choice of the High-Dimensional Model Representation format combined with a modified Least Angle
Regression technique. The resulting basis then provides the structure for the actual approximation
basis, possibly using different functions, more parsimonious and nonlinear in its coefficients.
To evaluate the coefficients, both an alternate least squares and an alternate weighted total least
squares methods are employed. Examples are provided for the approximation of a random variable
in a high-dimensional space as well as the estimation of a random field. Stochastic dimensions up
to 100 are considered, with an amount of information as low as about 3 samples per dimension, and robustness
of the approximation is demonstrated w.r.t. noise in the dataset. The computational cost of the
solution method is shown to scale only linearly with the cardinality of the a priori basis and exhibits
a (N_q)^s, 2 <= s <= 3, dependence with the number N_q of samples in the dataset. The provided
numerical experiments illustrate the ability of the present approach to derive an accurate approximation
from scarce scattered data even in the presence of noise.
