We consider the problem of estimating the size of a maximum cut in a random \ER graph on $n$ nodes and
$\lfloor cn \rfloor$ edges. It is known~\cite{Coppersmith2004} that the size of the maximum cut
in this graph normalized by the number of nodes belongs to the asymptotic region $[c/2+0.37613\sqrt{c},c/2+0.58870\sqrt{c}]$
with high probability (w.h.p.) as $n$ increases, for all sufficiently large $c$. In this paper we
improve both upper and lower bounds by introducing a novel bounding technique. Specifically, we
establish that the size of the maximum cut normalized by the number of nodes belongs to the interval
$[c/2+0.47523\sqrt{c},c/2+0.55909\sqrt{c}]$ w.h.p. as $n$ increases, for all sufficiently
large $c$. Instead of considering the expected number of cuts achieving a particular value as is
done in the first moment method, we observe that every maximum size cut satisfies a certain local
optimality property, and we compute the expected number of cuts with a given value satisfying this
local optimality property. Estimating this expectation amounts to solving a rather involved two
dimensional large deviations problem. We solve this underlying large deviation problem asymptotically
as $c$ increases and use it to obtain an improved upper bound on the Max-Cut value. The lower bound
is obtained by the second moment method, coupled with the same local optimality constraint, and
is shown to work up to the stated lower bound. Our results have immediate implications to a very related
model -- anti-ferromagnetic Ising model. As a corollary we obtain that the ground state energy normalized
by $2\sqrt{c}n$ for this model on the same random graph belongs to $[-0.55909,-0.47523]$ for all
sufficiently large $c$ w.h.p. Finally, we also obtain an improved lower bound $1.36000n$ of Max-Cut
for random cubic graph or cubic graph with a large girth, improving the previous best bound $1.33774n$.
