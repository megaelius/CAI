This is the first in a series of papers devoted to the theory of decomposition spaces, a general framework
for incidence algebras and M\"obius inversion, where algebraic identities are realised by taking
homotopy cardinality of equivalences of $\infty$-groupoids. A decomposition space is a simplicial
$\infty$-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition, weaker than the Segal condition, expressed
in terms of active and inert maps in $\Delta$. Just as the Segal condition expresses composition,
the new condition expresses decomposition, and there is an abundance of examples in combinatorics.
After establishing some basic properties of decomposition spaces, the main result of this first
paper shows that to any decomposition space there is an associated incidence coalgebra, spanned
by the space of 1-simplices, and with coefficients in $\infty$-groupoids. We take a functorial
viewpoint throughout, emphasising conservative ULF functors; these induce coalgebra homomorphisms.
Reduction procedures in the classical theory of incidence coalgebras are examples of this notion,
and many are examples of decalage of decomposition spaces. An interesting class of examples of decomposition
spaces beyond Segal spaces is provided by Hall algebras: the Waldhausen S-construction of an abelian
(or stable infinity) category is shown to be a decomposition space. Note: The notion of decomposition
space was arrived at independently by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov (arXiv:1212.3563) who call them
unital 2-Segal spaces. Our theory is quite orthogonal to theirs: the definitions are different
in spirit and appearance, and the theories differ in terms of motivation, examples and directions.
