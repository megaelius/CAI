Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n\ge 2$, be a 1-sided non-tangentially accessible domain
(aka uniform domain), that is, a set which satisfies the interior Corkscrew and Harnack chain conditions,
respectively scale-invariant/quantitative versions of openness and path-connectedness. Assume
that $\Omega$ satisfies the so-called capacity density condition. Let $L_0u=-{\rm div\,}(A_0\nabla
u)$, $Lu=-{\rm div\,}(A\nabla u)$ be two real (non-necessarily symmetric) uniformly elliptic
operators, and write $\omega_{L_0}$, $\omega_L$ for the associated elliptic measures. The goal
of this paper is to find sufficient conditions guaranteeing that $\omega_L$ satisfies an $A_\infty$-condition
or a $RH_q$-condition with respect to $\omega_{L_0}$. We show that if the discrepancy of the two
matrices satisfies a natural Carleson measure condition with respect to $\omega_{L_0}$ then $\omega_L\in
A_\infty(\omega_{L_0})$. Moreover, $\omega_L\in RH_q(\omega_{L_0})$ for any given $1<q<\infty$
if the Carleson measure condition is assumed to hold with a sufficiently small constant. This extends
previous work of Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher and Milakis-Pipher-Toro who considered Lipschitz and
chord-arc domains. Here we go beyond as the capacity density condition is much weaker than the existence
of exterior Corkscrew balls. The "large constant" case, where the discrepancy satisfies a Carleson
measure condition, is new even for nice domains such as the unit ball, the upper half-space, or Lipschitz
domains. Our results do not have a nice surface measure: all the analysis is done with the underlying
measure $\omega_{L_0}$. When particularized to Lipschitz, chord-arc, or 1-sided chord-arc domains,
we recover previous results and extend some of them. Of independent interest is the extension of
the Dahlberg-Jerison-Kenig result concerning square functions and non-tangential maximal functions
to our general setting.
