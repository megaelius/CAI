The problem of time in quantum gravity calls for a relational solution. Using quantum reduction
maps, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between three approaches to relational quantum
dynamics: 1) relational observables in the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantization, 2) Page
and Wootters' (PW) Schr\"odinger picture formalism, and 3) the relational Heisenberg picture
obtained via symmetry reduction. Constituting three faces of the same dynamics, we call this equivalence
the trinity. We develop a quantization procedure for relational Dirac observables using covariant
POVMs which encompass non-ideal clocks. The quantum reduction maps reveal this procedure as the
quantum analog of gauge-invariantly extending gauge-fixed quantities. We establish algebraic
properties of these relational observables. We extend a recent `clock-neutral' approach to changing
temporal reference frames, transforming relational observables and states, and demonstrate
a clock dependent temporal nonlocality effect. We show that Kucha\v{r}'s criticism, alleging
that the conditional probabilities of the PW formalism violate the constraint, is incorrect. They
are a quantum analog of a gauge-fixed description of a gauge-invariant quantity and equivalent
to the manifestly gauge-invariant evaluation of relational observables in the physical inner
product. The trinity furthermore resolves a previously reported normalization ambiguity and
clarifies the role of entanglement in the PW formalism. The trinity finally permits us to resolve
Kucha\v{r}'s criticism that the PW formalism yields wrong propagators by showing how conditional
probabilities of relational observables give the correct transition probabilities. Unlike previous
proposals, our resolution does not invoke approximations, ideal clocks or ancilla systems, is
manifestly gauge-invariant, and easily extends to an arbitrary number of conditionings.
