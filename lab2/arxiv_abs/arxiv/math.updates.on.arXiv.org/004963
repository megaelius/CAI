We study Lord Rayleigh's problem for clamped plates on an arbitrary $n$-dimensional $(n\geq 2)$
Cartan-Hadamard manifold $(M,g)$ with sectional curvature $\textbf{K}\leq -\kappa^2$ for some
$\kappa\geq 0.$ We first prove a McKean-type spectral gap estimate, i.e. the fundamental tone of
any domain in $(M,g)$ is universally bounded from below by $\frac{(n-1)^4}{16}\kappa^4$ whenever
the $\kappa$-Cartan-Hadamard conjecture holds on $(M,g)$, e.g. in 2- and 3-dimensions due to Bol
(1941) and Kleiner (1992), respectively. In 2- and 3-dimensions we prove sharp isoperimetric inequalities
for sufficiently small clamped plates, i.e. the fundamental tone of any domain in $(M,g)$ of volume
$v>0$ is not less than the corresponding fundamental tone of a geodesic ball of the same volume $v$
in the space of constant curvature $-\kappa^2$ provided that $v\leq c_n/\kappa^n$ with $c_2\approx
21.031$ and $c_3\approx 1.721$, respectively. In particular, Rayleigh's problem in Euclidean
spaces resolved by Nadirashvili (1992) and Ashbaugh and Benguria (1995) appears as a limiting case
in our setting (i.e. $\textbf{K}\equiv\kappa=0$). The sharpness of our results requires the validity
of the $\kappa$-Cartan-Hadamard conjecture (i.e. sharp isoperimetric inequality on $(M,g)$)
and peculiar properties of the Gaussian hypergeometric function, both valid only in dimensions
2 and 3; nevertheless, some nonoptimal estimates of the fundamental tone of arbitrary clamped plates
are also provided in high-dimensions. As an application, by using the sharp isoperimetric inequality
for small clamped hyperbolic discs, we give necessarily and sufficient conditions for the existence
of a nontrivial solution to an elliptic PDE involving the biharmonic Laplace-Beltrami operator.
