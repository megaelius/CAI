Hypertrees and noncrossing trees are well-established objects in the combinatorics literature,
but the hybrid notion of a noncrossing hypertree has received less attention. In this article I investigate
the poset of noncrossing hypertrees as an induced subposet of the hypertree poset. Its dual is the
face poset of a simplicial complex, one that can be identified with a generalized cluster complex
of type $A$. The first main result is that this noncrossing hypertree complex is homeomorphic to
a piecewise spherical complex associated with the noncrossing partition lattice and thus it has
a natural metric. The fact that the order complex of the noncrossing partition lattice with its bounding
elements removed is homeomorphic to a generalized cluster complex was not previously known or conjectured.
The metric noncrossing hypertree complex is a union of unit spheres with a number of remarkable properties:
1) the metric subspheres and simplices in each dimension are both bijectively labeled by the set
of noncrossing hypertrees with a fixed number of hyperedges, 2) the number of spheres containing
the simplex labeled by the noncrossing tree $\tau$ is the same as the number simplices in the sphere
labeled by the noncrossing tree $\tau$, and 3) among the maximal spherical subcomplexes one finds
every normal fan of a metric realization of the simple associahedron associated to the cluster algebra
of type $A$. In particular, the poset of noncrossing hypertrees and its metric simplicial complex
provide a new perspective on familiar combinatorial objects and a common context in which to view
the known bijections between noncrossing partitions and the vertices/facets of simple/simplicial
associahedra.
