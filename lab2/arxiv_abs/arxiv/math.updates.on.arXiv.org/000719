Our work in this paper is motivated by an elementary but also fundamental and highly practical observation
-- that uncertainty in constructing a network graph $\hat{G}$, as an approximation (or estimate)
of some true graph $G$, manifests as errors in the status of (non)edges that must necessarily propagate
to any summaries $\eta(G)$ we seek. Mimicking the common practice of using plug-in estimates $\eta(\hat{G})$
as proxies for $\eta(G)$, our goal is to characterize the distribution of the discrepency $D=\eta(\hat{G})
- \eta(G)$, in the specific case where $\eta(\cdot)$ is a subgraph count. In the empirically relevant
setting of large, sparse graphs with low-rate measurement errors, we demonstrate under an independent
and unbiased error model and for the specific case of counting edges that a Poisson-like regime maintains.
Specifically, we show that the appropriate limiting distribution is a Skellam distribution, rather
than a normal distribution. Next, because dependent errors typically can be expected when counting
subgraphs in practice, either at the level of the edges themselves or due to overlap among subgraphs,
we develop a parallel formalism for using the Skellam distribution in such cases. In particular,
using Stein's method, we present a series of results leading to the quantification of the accuracy
with which the difference of two sums of dependent Bernoulli random variables may be approximated
by a Skellam. This formulation is general and likely of some independent interest. We then illustrate
the use of these results in our original context of subgraph counts, where we examine (i) the case
of counting edges, under a simple dependent error model, and (ii) the case of counting chains of length
$2$ under an independent error model. We finish with a discussion of various open problems raised
by our work.
