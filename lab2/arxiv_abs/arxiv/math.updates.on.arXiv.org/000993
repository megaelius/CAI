We design and analyze several Finite Element Methods (FEMs) applied to the Caffarelli-Silvestre
extension that localizes the fractional powers of symmetric, coercive, linear elliptic operators
in bounded domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider open, bounded, polytopal but
not necessarily convex domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $d=1,2$. For the solution to
the extension problem, we establish analytic regularity with respect to the extended variable
$y\in (0,\infty)$. We prove that the solution belongs to countably normed, power-exponentially
weighted Bochner spaces of analytic functions with respect to $y$, taking values in corner-weighted
Kondat'ev type Sobolev spaces in $\Omega$. In $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we discretize with
continuous, piecewise linear, Lagrangian FEM ($P_1$-FEM) with mesh refinement near corners,
and prove that first order convergence rate is attained for compatible data $f\in \mathbb{H}^{1-s}(\Omega)$.
We also prove that tensorization of a $P_1$-FEM in $\Omega$ with a suitable $hp$-FEM in the extended
variable achieves log-linear complexity with respect to $\mathcal{N}_\Omega$, the number of
degrees of freedom in the domain $\Omega$. In addition, we propose a novel, sparse tensor product
FEM based on a multilevel $P_1$-FEM in $\Omega$ and on a $P_1$-FEM on radical-geometric meshes in
the extended variable. We prove that this approach also achieves log-linear complexity with respect
to $\mathcal{N}_\Omega$. Finally, under the stronger assumption that the data is analytic in $\overline{\Omega}$,
and without compatibility at $\partial \Omega$, we establish exponential rates of convergence
of $hp$-FEM for spectral, fractional diffusion operators. We also report numerical experiments
for model problems which confirm the theoretical results. We indicate several extensions and generalizations
of the proposed methods.
