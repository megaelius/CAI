Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a $II_1$ factor acting on the Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, and $\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}$
be the Murray-von Neumann algebra of closed densely-defined operators affiliated with $\mathscr{M}$.
Let $\tau$ ($\tau_n$, respectively) denote the unique faithful normal tracial state on $\mathscr{M}$
($M_n(\mathscr{M})$, respectively), and $\Delta$ ($\Delta_n$, respectively) be the Fuglede-Kadison
determinant associated with $\tau$ ($\tau_n$, respectively). Let $\mathscr{M}_{\Delta}$ denote
the $*$-subalgebra of $\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}$ consisting of (unbounded) operators $T$
satisfying $\tau(\log^{+} |T|) < \infty$, where $\log^{+} := \max \{ 0, \log\}$ on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$.
By virtue of Nelson's theory of non-commutative integration, $\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}$
may be identified with the completion of $\mathscr{M}$ in the $\tau$-measure topology. In this
article, we show that $M_n(\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}) \cong M_n(\mathscr{M})_{\textrm{aff}}$
as unital ordered complex topological $*$-algebras with the isomorphism extending the identity
mapping of $M_n(\mathscr{M}) \to M_n(\mathscr{M})$. Using a version of the Douglas factorization
lemma for Murray-von Neumann algebras, we show that $M_n(\mathscr{M}_{\Delta}) = \big(M_n(\mathscr{M})\big)_{\Delta_n}$,
viewing both $*$-algebras as $*$-subalgebras of $M_n(\mathscr{M})_{\textrm{aff}}$. Consequently,
the algebraic machinery of rank identities and determinant identities is applicable to $\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}$
and $\mathscr{M}_{\Delta}$, respectively. As a step further in the Heisenberg-von Neumann puzzle
discussed by Kadison-Liu, we provide some necessary conditions for pairs of operators $P, Q$ in
$\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}$ satisfying the Heisenberg commutation relation, $Q \; \hat \cdot
\; P - P \; \hat \cdot \; Q = {i\mkern1mu}I$ (if at all such operators exist).
