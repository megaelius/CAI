Let each site of the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ be independently assigned one of three states:
a \textit{trap} with probability $p$, a \textit{target} with probability $q$, and \textit{open}
with probability $1-p-q$, where $0<p+q<1$. Consider the following game: a token starts at the origin,
and two players take turns to move, where a move consists of moving the token from its current site
$x$ to either $x+(0,1)$ or $x+(1,0)$. A player who moves the token to a trap loses the game immediately,
while a player who moves the token to a target wins the game immediately. Is there positive probability
that the game is \emph{drawn} with best play -- i.e.\ that neither player can force a win? This is equivalent
to the question of ergodicity of a certain family of elementary one-dimensional probabilistic
cellular automata (PCA). These automata have been studied in the contexts of enumeration of directed
lattice animals, the golden-mean subshift, and the hard-core model, and their ergodicity has been
noted as an open problem by several authors. We prove that these PCA are ergodic, and correspondingly
that the game on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ has no draws. On the other hand, we prove that certain analogous games
\emph{do} exhibit draws for suitable parameter values on various directed graphs in higher dimensions,
including an oriented version of the even sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in all $d\geq3$. This is
proved via a dimension reduction to a hard-core lattice gas in dimension $d-1$. We show that draws
occur whenever the corresponding hard-core model has multiple Gibbs distributions. We conjecture
that draws occur also on the standard oriented lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 3$, but here our
method encounters a fundamental obstacle.
