The dynamically defined measure (DDM) $\Phi$ arising from a finite measure $\phi_0$ on an initial
$\sigma$-algebra on a set $X$ and an invertible map acting on the latter is considered. Several lower
bounds for it are obtained and sufficient conditions for its positivity are deduced under the general
assumption that there exists an invariant measure $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda\ll\phi_0$. In
particular, DDMs arising from the Hellinger integral $\mathcal{J}_\alpha(\Lambda,\phi_0)\geq\mathcal{H}^{\alpha,0}(\Lambda,\phi_0)\geq\mathcal{H}_\alpha(\Lambda,\phi_0)$,
$\alpha\in[0,1]$, are constructed with $\mathcal{H}_{0}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q)
= \Phi(Q)$, $\mathcal{H}_{1}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q) = \Lambda(Q)$ and \[\Phi(Q)^{1-\alpha}\Lambda(Q)^{\alpha}\geq\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q)\]
for all measurable $Q$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$. Also, a relative entropy measure $\bar{\mathcal{K}}_\alpha(\Lambda|\phi_0)$
is introduced s.t. \[\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q)\geq\Lambda(Q)e^{-\frac{1-\alpha}{\Lambda(Q)}\bar{\mathcal{K}}_{\alpha}(\Lambda|\phi_0)(Q)}\]
for all measurable $Q$ with $\Lambda(Q)>0$ and $\alpha\geq0$ s.t. $\Phi(Q)<\Lambda(Q)e^{1/(1-\alpha)}$.
If $\Lambda$ is ergodic, then the finiteness of the relative entropy measure is equivalent to $\Lambda\ll\Phi$
and to the $\Lambda$-essential boundedness of $d\Lambda/d\phi_0$. Finally, for every measurable
$Q$, it is shown that $[0,1]\owns\alpha\longmapsto\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}(\Lambda,\phi_0)(Q)$
is log-convex, all one-sided derivatives of $(0,1)\owns\alpha\longmapsto\mathcal{H}^{\alpha,0}(\Lambda,\phi_0)(Q)$
and $(0,1)\owns\alpha\longmapsto\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}(\Lambda,\phi_0)(Q)$ are obtained,
and some lower bounds for the functions by means of the derivatives are given. Some sufficient conditions
for the continuity and a one-sided differentiability of the smallest function are provided.
