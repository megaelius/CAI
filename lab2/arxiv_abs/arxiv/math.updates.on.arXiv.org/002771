The Libor market model is a mainstay term structure model of interest rates for derivatives pricing,
especially for Bermudan swaptions, and other exotic Libor callable derivatives. For numerical
implementation the pricing of derivatives with Libor market models is mainly carried out with Monte
Carlo simulation. The PDE grid approach is not particularly feasible due to Curse of Dimensionality.
The standard Monte Carlo method for American/Bermudan swaption pricing more or less uses regression
to estimate expected value as a linear combination of basis functions (Longstaff and Schwartz).
However, Monte Carlo method only provides the lower bound for American option price. Another complexity
is the computation of the sensitivities of the option, the so-called Greeks, which are fundamental
for a trader's hedging activity. Recently, an alternative numerical method based on deep learning
and backward stochastic differential equations appeared in quite a few researches. For European
style options the feedforward deep neural networks (DNN) show not only feasibility but also efficiency
to obtain both prices and numerical Greeks. In this paper, a new backward DNN solver is proposed for
Bermudan swaptions. Our approach is representing financial pricing problems in the form of high
dimensional stochastic optimal control problems, FBSDEs, or equivalent PDEs. We demonstrate
that using backward DNN the high-dimension Bermudan swaption pricing and hedging can be solved
effectively and efficiently. A comparison between Monte Carlo simulation and the new method for
pricing vanilla interest rate options manifests the superior performance of the new method. We
then use this method to calculate prices and Greeks of Bermudan swaptions as a prelude for other Libor
callable derivatives.
