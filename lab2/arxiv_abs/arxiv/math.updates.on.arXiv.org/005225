Self-organized pattern behavior is ubiquitous throughout nature, from fish schooling to collective
cell dynamics during organism development. Qualitatively these patterns display impressive
consistency, yet variability inevitably exists within pattern-forming systems on both microscopic
and macroscopic scales. Quantifying variability and measuring pattern features can inform the
underlying agent interactions and allow for predictive analyses. Nevertheless, current methods
for analyzing patterns that arise from collective behavior only capture macroscopic features,
or rely on either manual inspection or smoothing algorithms that lose the underlying agent-based
nature of the data. Here we introduce methods based on topological data analysis and interpretable
machine learning for quantifying both agent-level features and global pattern attributes on a
large scale. Because the zebrafish is a model organism for skin pattern formation, we focus specifically
on analyzing its skin patterns as a means of illustrating our approach. Using a recent agent-based
model, we simulate thousands of wild-type and mutant zebrafish patterns and apply our methodology
to better understand pattern variability in zebrafish. Our methodology is able to quantify the
differential impact of stochasticity in cell interactions on wild-type and mutant patterns, and
we use our methods to predict stripe and spot statistics as a function of varying cellular communication.
Our work provides a new approach to automatically quantifying biological patterns and analyzing
agent-based dynamics so that we can now answer critical questions in pattern formation at a much
larger scale.
