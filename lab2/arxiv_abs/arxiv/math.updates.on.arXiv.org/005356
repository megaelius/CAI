In this paper we present a numerical study of a mathematical model of spiking neurons introduced
by Ferrari et al. in an article entitled Phase transition forinfinite systems of spiking neurons.
In this model we have a countable number of neurons linked together in a network, each of them having
a membrane potential taking value in the integers, and each of them spiking over time at a rate which
depends on the membrane potential through some rate function $\phi$. Beside being affected by a
spike each neuron can also be affected by leaking. At each of these leak times, which occurs for a given
neuron at a fixed rate $\gamma$, the membrane potential of the neuron concerned is spontaneously
reset to $0$. A wide variety of versions of this model can be considered by choosing different graph
structures for the network and different activation functions. It was rigorously shown that when
the graph structure of the network is the one-dimensional lattice with a hard threshold for the activation
function, this model presents a phase transition with respect to $\gamma$, and that it also presents
a metastable behavior. By the latter we mean that in the sub-critical regime the re-normalized time
of extinction converges to an exponential random variable of mean 1. It has also been proven that
in the super-critical regime the renormalized time of extinction converges in probability to 1.
Here, we investigate numerically a richer class of graph structures and activation functions.
Namely we investigate the case of the two dimensional and the three dimensional lattices, as well
as the case of a linear function and a sigmoid function for the activation function. We present numerical
evidence that the result of metastability in the sub-critical regime holds for these graphs and
activation functions as well as the convergence in probability to $1$ in the super-critical regime.
