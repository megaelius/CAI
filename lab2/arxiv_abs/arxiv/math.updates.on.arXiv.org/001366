Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. For $m\geq n$, we define $\tau_{m,n,k}$
to be the set of $m\times n$ matrices over $K$ with kernel dimension $\geq k$. This is a projective
subvariety of $\bbP^{mn-1}$, and is called the (generic) determinantal variety. In most cases
$\tau_{m,n,k}$ is singular with singular locus $\tau_{m,n,k+1}$. In this paper we give explicit
formulas computing the Chern-Mather class ($c_M$) and the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class ($c_{SM}$)
of $\tau_{m,n,k}$, as classes in the projective space. We also obtain formulas for the conormal
cycles and the characteristic cycles of these varieties, and for their generic Euclidean Distance
degree. Further, when $K=\bbC$, we prove that the characteristic cycle of the intersection cohomology
sheaf of a determinantal variety agrees with its conormal cycle (and hence is irreducible). Our
formulas are based on calculations of degrees of certain Chern classes of the universal bundles
over the Grassmannian. For some small values of $m,n,k$, we use Macaulay2 to exhibit examples of
the Chern-Mather classes, the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes and the classes of characteristic
cycles of $\tau_{m,n,k}$. On the basis of explicit computations in low dimensions, we formulate
conjectures concerning the effectivity of the classes and the vanishing of specific terms in the
Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of the largest strata $\tau_{m,n,k}\smallsetminus \tau_{m,n,k+1}$.
The irreducibility of the characteristic cycle of the intersection cohomology sheaf follows from
the Kashiwara-Dubson's microlocal index theorem, a study of the `Tjurina transform' of $\tau_{m,n,k}$,
and the recent computation of the local Euler obstruction of $\tau_{m,n,k}$ .
