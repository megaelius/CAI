In this paper, we present a novel method to draw a circle tangent to three given circles lying on a plane.
Using the analytic geometry and inversion (reflection) theorems, the center and radius of the inversion
circle are obtained. Inside any one of the three given circles, a circle of the similar radius and
concentric with its own corresponding original circle is drawn.The tangent circle to these three
similar circles is obtained. Then the inverted circles of the three similar circles and the tangent
circle regarding an obtainable point and a computable power of inversion (reflection) constant
are obtained. These circles (three inverted circles and an inverted tangent circle)will be tangent
together.Just,we obtain another reflection point and power of inversion so that those three reflected
circles (inversions of three similar circles) can be reflections of three original circles, respectively.
In such a case,the reflected circle tangent to three reflected circles regarding same new inversion
system will be tangent to the three original ones. This circle is our desirable circle. A drawing
algorithm is also given for drawing desirable circle by straightedge and compass. A survey of conformal
mapping theory and inversion in higher dimensions is also accomplished. Although, Laguerre transformation
might be used for solution of this problem, but we do not make use of this method. Our novelty is just
for drawing a circle tangent to three given circles applying a tangent circle to three identical
circles concentric with three given ones and then inverting them as original ones by compass and
straightedge not any thing else.
