We further investigate properties of the Gaussian free field (GFF) on the metric graph associated
to a discrete weighted graph (where the edges of the latter are replaced by continuous line-segments
of appropriate length) that has been introduced by the first author. On such a metric graph, the GFF
is a random continuous function that generalises one-dimensional Brownian bridges so that one-dimensional
techniques can be used. In the present paper, we define and study the pseudo-metric defined on the
metric graph (and therefore also on the discrete graph itself), where the length of a path on the metric
graph is defined to be the local time at level zero accumulated by the Gaussian free field along this
path. We first derive a pathwise transformation that relates the GFF on the metric graph with the
reflected GFF on the metric graph via the pseudo-distance defined by the latter. This is a generalisation
of Paul L\'evy's result relating the local time at zero of Brownian motion to the supremum of another
Brownian motion. We also compute explicitly the distribution of certain functionals of this pseudo-metric
and of the GFF. In particular, we point out that when the boundary consists of just two points, the
law of the pseudo-distance between them depends solely on the resistance of the network between
them. We then discuss questions related to the scaling limit of this pseudo-metric in the two-dimensional
case, which should be the conformally invariant way to measure distances between CLE(4) loops introduced
and studied by the second author with Wu, and by Sheffield, Watson and Wu. Our explicit laws on metric
graphs also lead to new conjectures for related functionals of the continuum GFF on fairly general
Riemann surfaces.
