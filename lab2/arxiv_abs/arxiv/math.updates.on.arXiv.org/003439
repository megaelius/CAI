High-dimensional auto-regressive models provide a natural way to model influence between $M$
actors given multi-variate time series data for $T$ time intervals. While there has been considerable
work on network estimation, there is limited work in the context of inference and hypothesis testing.
In particular, prior work on hypothesis testing in time series has been restricted to linear Gaussian
auto-regressive models. From a practical perspective, it is important to determine suitable statistical
tests for connections between actors that go beyond the Gaussian assumption. In the context of \emph{high-dimensional}
time series models, confidence intervals present additional estimators since most estimators
such as the Lasso and Dantzig selectors are biased which has led to \emph{de-biased} estimators.
In this paper we address these challenges and provide convergence in distribution results and confidence
intervals for the multi-variate AR(p) model with sub-Gaussian noise, a generalization of Gaussian
noise that broadens applicability and presents numerous technical challenges. The main technical
challenge lies in the fact that unlike Gaussian random vectors, for sub-Gaussian vectors zero correlation
does not imply independence. The proof relies on using an intricate truncation argument to develop
novel concentration bounds for quadratic forms of dependent sub-Gaussian random variables. Our
convergence in distribution results hold provided $T = \Omega((s \vee \rho)^2 \log^2 M)$, where
$s$ and $\rho$ refer to sparsity parameters which matches existed results for hypothesis testing
with i.i.d. samples. We validate our theoretical results with simulation results for both block-structured
and chain-structured networks.
