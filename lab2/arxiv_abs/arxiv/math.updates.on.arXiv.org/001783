The accurate, reliable and efficient numerical approximation of multi-physics processes in heterogeneous
porous media with varying media coefficients that include fluid flow and structure interactions
is of fundamental importance in energy, environmental, petroleum and biomedical engineering
applications fields for instance. Important applications include subsurface compaction drive,
carbon sequestration, hydraulic and thermal fracturing and oil recovery. Biomedical applications
include the simulation of vibration therapy for osteoporosis processes of trabeculae bones, estimating
stress levels induced by tumour growth within the brain or next-generation spinal disc prostheses.
Variational space-time methods offers some appreciable advantages such as the flexibility of
the triangulation for complex geometries in space and natural local time stepping, the straightforward
construction of higher-order approximations and the application of efficient goal-oriented
(duality-based) adaptivity concepts. In addition to that, uniform space-time variational methods
appear to be advantageous for stability and a priori error analyses of the discrete schemes. Especially
(high-order) discontinuous in time approaches appear to have favourable properties due to the
weak application of the initial conditions. The development of monolithic multi-physics schemes,
instead of iterative coupling methods between the physical problems, is a key component of the research
to reduce the modeling error. Special emphasis is on the development of efficient multi-physics
and multigrid preconditioning technologies and their implementation. The simulation software
DTM++ is a modularised framework written in C++11 and builds on top of deal.II toolchains. The implementation
allows parallel simulations from notebooks up to cluster scale.
