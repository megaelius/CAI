The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and its counting counterpart appears under different
guises in many areas of mathematics, computer science, and elsewhere. Its structural and algorithmic
properties have demonstrated to play a crucial role in many of those applications. For instance,
in the decision CSPs, structural properties of the relational structures involved---like, for
example, dismantlability---and their logical characterizations have been instrumental for
determining the complexity and other properties of the problem. Topological properties of the
solution set such as connectedness are related to the hardness of CSPs over random structures. Additionally,
in approximate counting and statistical physics, where CSPs emerge in the form of spin systems,
mixing properties and the uniqueness of Gibbs measures have been heavily exploited for approximating
partition functions and free energy. In spite of the great diversity of those features, there are
some eerie similarities between them. These were observed and made more precise in the case of graph
homomorphisms by Brightwell and Winkler, who showed that dismantlability of the target graph,
connectedness of the set of homomorphisms, and good mixing properties of the corresponding spin
system are all equivalent. In this paper we go a step further and demonstrate similar connections
for arbitrary CSPs. This requires much deeper understanding of dismantling and the structure of
the solution space in the case of relational structures, and new refined concepts of mixing introduced
by Brice\~no. In addition, we develop properties related to the study of valid extensions of a given
partially defined homomorphism, an approach that turns out to be novel even in the graph case. We
also add to the mix the combinatorial property of finite duality and its logic counterpart, FO-definability,
studied by Larose, Loten, and Tardif.
