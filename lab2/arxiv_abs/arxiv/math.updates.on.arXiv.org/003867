This paper proposes a secure users oriented multiple-input and single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) downlink transmission scheme, where multiple legitimate users are categorized
as quality of service (QoS)-required users (QU) and the security-required users (SU) overheard
by a passive eavesdropper. The basic idea is to exploit zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) to cancel
interference among SUs, and then several QUs are efficiently scheduled based on the obtained beamforming
vectors to divide the legitimate users into several user clusters, in such a way that the QUs could
share the concurrent transmissions and help to interfere with the eavesdropper to enhance SU secrecy.
The goal is to maximize the achievable minimum secrecy rate (MSR) and sum secrecy rate (SSR) of all
SUs, respectively, subject to the secrecy outage probability (SOP) constraint of each SU and the
QoS constraint of each QU. To provide a comprehensive investigation we consider two extreme cases
that the eavesdropper has perfect multiuser detection ability (lower bound of secrecy) or does
not have multiuser detection ability (upper bound of secrecy). In the lower bound case, the Dinkelbach
algorithm and the monotonic optimization (MO)-based outer polyblock approximation algorithm
are proposed to solve the max-min secrecy rate (MMSR) and max-sum secrecy rate (MSSR) problems,
respectively. As for the upper bound case, an alternative optimization (AO)-based algorithm is
proposed to solve the two non-convex problems. Finally, the superiority of the proposed cases to
the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) one is verified by numerical results.
