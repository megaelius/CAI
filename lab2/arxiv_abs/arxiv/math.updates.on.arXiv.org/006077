For a continuous self-map $f$ on a compact interval $I$ and the induced map $\hat f$ on the space $\mathcal{M}(I)$
of probability measures, we obtain a sharp condition to guarantee that $(I,f)$ is transitive if
and only if $(\mathcal{M}(I),\hat f)$ is transitive. We also show that the sensitivity of $(I,f)$
is equivalent to that of $(\mathcal{M}(I),\hat f)$. We prove that $(\mathcal{M}(I),\hat f)$ must
have infinite topological entropy for any transitive system $(I,f)$, while there exists a transitive
non-autonomous system $(I,f_{0,\infty})$ such that $(\mathcal{M}(I),\hat f_{0,\infty})$
has zero topological entropy, where $f_{0,\infty}=\{f_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is a sequence of continuous
self-maps on $I$. For a continuous self-map $f$ on a general compact metric space $X$, we show that
chain transitivity of $(X, f)$ implies chain mixing of $(\mathcal{M}(X),\hat f)$, and we provide
two counterexamples to demonstrate that the converse is not true. We confirm that shadowing of $(X,f)$
is not inherited by $(\mathcal{M}(X),\hat f)$ in general. For a non-autonomous system $(X,f_{0,\infty})$,
we prove that if $(\mathcal{M}(X),\hat{f}_{0,\infty})$ is weak mixing of order $n$, then so is
$(X,f_{0,\infty})$ for any $n\geq2$; while there exists $(X,f_{0,\infty})$ such that it is weak
mixing of order $2$ but $(\mathcal{M}(X),\hat{f}_{0,\infty})$ is not. We prove that if $f_n$ is
surjective for all $n\geq 0$, then chain mixing of $(\mathcal{M}(X),\hat f_{0,\infty})$ always
holds true, and shadowing of $(\mathcal{M}(X),\hat f_{0,\infty})$ implies mixing of $(X, f_{0,\infty})$.
In addition, we generalize some existing results from autonomous to non-autonomous systems.
