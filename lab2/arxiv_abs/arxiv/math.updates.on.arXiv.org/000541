In this note, we provide an overview of two important competing data assimilation schemes that were
developed in the past two-decade, discuss the current methods that are operationally used in weather
forecasting applications, and point out one major challenge in data assimilation community: To
utilize these existing schemes in the presence of model error from unresolved scales. The main goal
of this note is to discuss a simple mathematical analysis to understand why this problem is difficult
and to provide a mathematically justifiable stochastic parameterization to mitigate this type
of model error in practical multiscale filtering problems. This is a prototypical situation in
many applications due to limited ability in resolving the smaller scale processes as well as the
difficulty to model the interaction across scales. We will present simple examples to point out
the importance of accounting for model error when the separation of scales are not apparent. These
examples also elucidate the necessity of treating model error as a stochastic process in a nontrivial
fashion for optimal filtering. In general, it is difficult to guess the appropriate stochastic
models to represent model error and even to estimate higher order statistics. Several classical
approaches to estimate model error statistics are briefly reviewed and reassessed, and several
recent developments are overviewed, including important open problems/questions. We hope that
this review note can make this important issue accessible to inspire more applied mathematicians
to work on this exciting open problem and can help the future design of more robust methods for coping
with model error.
