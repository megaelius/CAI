We construct edge vectors on the planar bicolored trivalent directed networks in the disk which
parametrize the positroid cells of totally non-negative Grassmannians. We introduce the notion
of local winding and local intersection indices using a gauge ray direction. We provide the following
characterization of edge vectors: 1) They solve full rank systems of linear relations at the internal
vertices with appropriate boundary conditions at boundary sinks, each system being uniquely identified
by the geometric indices of the graph (orientation and gauge ray direction);2) Their components
are rational in the edge weights with subtraction-free denominators, their explicit expressions
depend on conservative and edge flows. Moreover, if $\mathcal N$ is irreducible then the edge vector
components are subtraction free rational expressions in the weights;3) There exist explicit formulas
both for the transformation rules of the edge vectors with respect to the orientation and the several
gauges of the given network, and for the transformation of the edge vectors due to moves and reductions
of networks. Therefore, Postnikov boundary measurement map may be computed by solving such geometric
systems of relations. Vice versa, if each edge in the plabic graph $\mathcal G$ is contained in at
least one directed path from boundary to boundary, a system of relations on $\mathcal G$ has full
rank and its image is totally non-negative only if the edge signature is equivalent to one of geometric
type and, in such case, the image is the positroid cell for the graph. Such geometric relations provide
a complete characterization of the totally non-negative amalgamation of several copies of $Gr^{+}
(1,3)$ and $Gr^{+} (2,3)$ in the form of edge-signatures proposed by Lam, i.e. an explicit representation
of the amalgamation of cluster varieties introduced by Fock and Goncharov in this special case.
