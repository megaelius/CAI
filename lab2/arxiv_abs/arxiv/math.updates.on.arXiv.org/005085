Since Stein presented his ideas in the seminal paper \cite{s1}, there have been a lot of research
activities around Stein's method. Stein's method is a powerful tool to obtain the approximate error
of normal and non-normal approximation. The readers are referred to Chatterjee \cite{c} for recent
developments of Stein's method. While several works on Stein's method pay attention to the uniform
error bounds, Stein's method showed to be powerful on the non-uniform error bounds, too. By Stein's
method, Chen and Shao \cite{cls1, cls2} obtained the non-uniform Berry-Esseen bound for independent
and locally dependent random variables. The key in their works is the concentration inequality,
which also has strong connection with another approach called the \textit{exchangeable pair approach}.
The exchangeable pair approach turned out to be an important topic in Stein's method. Let $W$ be the
random variable under study. The pair $ (W,W') $ is called an exchangeable pair if $ (W,W')$ and $(W',W)
$ share the same distribution. With $ \Delta=W-W' $, Rinott and Rotar \cite{rr}, Shao and Su \cite{ss}
obtained the Berry-Esseen bound of the normal approximation when $\Delta$ is bounded. If $\Delta$
is unbounded, Chen and Shao \cite{cs2} provided a Berry-Esseen bound and got the optimal rate for
an independence test. The concentration inequality plays a crucial role in previous studies, such
as Shao and Su \cite{ss} , Chen and Shao \cite{cs2}. Recently, Shao and Zhang \cite{sz} made a big
break for unbounded $\Delta$ without using the concentration inequality. They obtained a simple
bound as seen from the following result.
