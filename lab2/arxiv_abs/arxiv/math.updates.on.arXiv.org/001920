In the theory of dynamical systems, a fundamental problem is to study the asymptotic behavior of
dynamical orbits. Lots of different asymptotic behavior have been learned including different
periodic-like recurrence such periodic and almost periodic, the level sets and irregular sets
of Birkhoff ergodic avearge, Lyapunov expoents. In present article we use upper and lower natural
density, upper and lower Banach density to differ statistical future of dynamical orbits and establish
several statistical concepts on limit sets, in particular such that not only different recurrence
are classifiable but also different non-recurrence are classifiable. In present paper we mainly
deal with dynamical orbits with empty syndetic center and show that twelve different statistical
structure over expanding or hyperbolic dynamical systems all have dynamical complexity as strong
as the dynamical system itself in the sense of topological entropy. Moreover, multifractal analysis
on various non-recurrence and Birkhoff ergodic averages are considered together to illustrate
that the non-recurrent set has rich and colorful asymptotic behavior from the statistical perspective,
although the non-recurrent set has zero measure for any invariant measure from the probabilistic
perspective. Roughly speaking, on one hand our results describe a world in which there are twelve
different predictable order in strongly chaotic systems but also there are strong chaos in any fixed
predictable order from the viewpoint of dynamical complexity on full topological entropy; and
on other hand we find that various asymptotic behavior such as (non-)recurrence and (ir)regularity
from differnt perspecitve survive togother and display strong dynamical complexity in the sense
of full topological entropy. In this process we obtain two powerful ergodic properties on entropy-dense
property and saturated property.
