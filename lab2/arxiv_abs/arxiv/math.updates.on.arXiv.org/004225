In this paper, we initiate the study of global offensive $k$-alliances in digraphs. Given a digraph
$D=(V(D),A(D))$, a global offensive $k$-alliance in a digraph $D$ is a subset $S\subseteq V(D)$
such that every vertex outside of $S$ has at least one in-neighbor from $S$ and also at least $k$ more
in-neighbors from $S$ than from outside of $S$, by assuming $k$ is an integer lying between two minus
the maximum in-degree of $D$ and the maximum in-degree of $D$. The global offensive $k$-alliance
number $\gamma_{k}^{o}(D)$ is the minimum cardinality among all global offensive $k$-alliances
in $D$. In this article we begin the study of the global offensive $k$-alliance number of digraphs.
For instance, we prove that finding the global offensive $k$-alliance number of digraphs $D$ is
an NP-hard problem for any value $k\in \{2-\Delta^-(D),\dots,\Delta^-(D)\}$ and that it remains
NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite digraphs when we consider the non-negative values
of $k$ given in the interval above. Based on these facts, lower bounds on $\gamma_{k}^{o}(D)$ with
characterizations of all digraphs attaining the bounds are given in this work. We also bound this
parameter for bipartite digraphs from above. For the particular case $k=1$, an immediate result
from the definition shows that $\gamma(D)\leq \gamma_{1}^{o}(D)$ for all digraphs $D$, in which
$\gamma(D)$ stands for the domination number of $D$. We show that these two digraph parameters are
the same for some infinite families of digraphs like rooted trees and contrafunctional digraphs.
Moreover, we show that the difference between $\gamma_{1}^{o}(D)$ and $\gamma(D)$ can be arbitrary
large for directed trees and connected functional digraphs.
