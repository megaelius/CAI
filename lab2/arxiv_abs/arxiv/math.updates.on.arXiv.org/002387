In the course of classifying the homogeneous permutations, Cameron introduced the viewpoint of
permutations as structures in a language of two linear orders, and this structural viewpoint is
taken up here. The majority of this thesis is concerned with Cameron's problem of classifying the
homogeneous structures in a language of finitely many linear orders, which we call finite-dimensional
permutation structures. Towards this problem, we present a construction that we conjecture produces
all such structures. Some evidence for this conjecture is given, including the classification
of the homogeneous 3-dimensional permutation structures. We next consider the topological dynamics,
in the style of Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c, of the automorphism groups of the homogeneous
finite-dimensional permutation structures we have constructed, which requires proving a structural
Ramsey theorem for all the associated amalgamation classes. Because the $\emptyset$-definable
equivalence relations in these homogeneous finite-dimensional permutation structures may form
arbitrary finite distributive lattices, the model-theoretic algebraic closure operation may
become quite complex, and so we require the framework recently introduced by Hubi\v{c}ka and Ne\v{s}etril.
Finally, we consider the decision problem for whether a finitely-constrained permutation avoidance
class is atomic, or equivalently, has the joint embedding property. As a first approximation to
this problem, we prove the undecidability of the corresponding decision problem in the category
of graphs. Modifying this proof also gives the undecidability, in the category of graphs, of the
corresponding decision problem for the joint homomorphism property, which is of interest in infinite-domain
constraint satisfaction problems.
