In the paper we introduce a new family of "small" sets which is tightly connected with two well known
$\sigma$-ideals: of Haar-null sets and of Haar-meager sets. We define a subset $A$ of a topological
group $X$ to be $\mathit{null}$-$\mathit{finite}$ if there exists an infinite compact subset
$K\subset X$ such that for every $x\in X$ the intersection $K\cap (x+A)$ is finite. We prove that
each null-finite Borel set in a complete metric Abelian group is Haar-null and Haar-meager. The
Borel restriction in the above result is essential as each non-discrete metric Abelian group is
the union of two null-finite sets. Applying null-finite sets to the theory of functional equations
and inequalities, we prove that a mid-point convex function $f:G\to\mathbb R$ defined on an open
convex subset $G$ of a metric linear space $X$ is continuous if it is upper bounded on a subset $B$ which
is not null-finite and whose closure is contained in $G$. This gives an alternative short proof of
a known generalization of Bernstein-Doetsch theorem (saying that a mid-point convex function
$f:G\to\mathbb R$ defined on an open covex subset $G$ of a metric linear space $X$ is continuous if
it is upper bounded on a non-empty open subset $B$ of $G$). Since Borel null-finite sets are Haar-meager
and Haar-null, we conclude that a mid-point convex function $f:G\to\mathbb{R}$ defined on an open
convex subset $G$ of a complete linear metric space $X$ is continuous if it is upper bounded on a Borel
subset $B\subset G$ which is not Haar-null or not Haar-meager in $X$. The last result resolves an
old problem in the theory of functional equations and inequalities posed by Baron and Ger in 1983.
