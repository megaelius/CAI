In this note, we consider the antibandwidth problem, also known as dual bandwidth problem, separation
problem and maximum differential coloring problem. Given a labeled graph (i.e., a numbering of
the vertices of a graph), the antibandwidth of a node is defined as the minimum absolute difference
of its labeling to the labeling of all its adjacent vertices. The goal in the antibandwidth problem
is to find a labeling maximizing the antibandwidth. The problem is NP-hard in general graphs and
has applications in diverse areas like scheduling, radio frequency assignment, obnoxious facility
location and map-coloring. There has been much work on deriving theoretical bounds for the problem
and also in the design of metaheuristics in recent years. However, the optimality gaps between the
best known solution values and reported upper bounds for the HarwellBoeing Matrix-instances,
which are the commonly used benchmark instances for this problem, are often very large (e.g., up
to 577%). The upper bounds reported in literature are based on the theoretical bounds involving
simple graph characteristics, i.e., size, order and degree, and a mixed-integer programming (MIP)
model. We present new MIP models for the problem, together with valid inequalities, and design a
branch-and-cut algorithm and an iterative solution algorithm based on them. These algorithms
also include two starting heuristics and a primal heuristic. We also present a constraint programming
approach, and calculate upper bounds based on the stability number and chromatic number. Our computational
study shows that the developed approaches allow to find the proven optimal solution for eight instances
from literature, where the optimal solution was unknown and also provide reduced gaps for eleven
additional instances, including improved solution values for seven instances, the largest optimality
gap is now 46%.
