In this paper, we consider a connected Riemannian manifold $M$ where a connected Lie group $G$ acts
effectively and isometrically. Assume $X\in\mathfrak{g}=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ defines a bounded
Killing vector field, we find some crucial algebraic properties of the decomposition $X=X_r+X_s$
according to a Levi decomposition $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g})+\mathfrak{s}$,
where $\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g})$ is the radical, and $\mathfrak{s}=\mathfrak{s}_c\oplus\mathfrak{s}_{nc}$
is a Levi subalgebra. The decomposition $X=X_r+X_s$ coincides with the abstract Jordan decomposition
of $X$, and is unique in the sense that it does not depend on the choice of $\mathfrak{s}$. By these
properties, we prove that the eigenvalues of $\mathrm{ad}(X):\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$
are all imaginary. Furthermore, when $M=G/H$ is a Riemannian homogeneous space, we can completely
determine all bounded Killing vector fields induced by vectors in $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that
the space of all these bounded Killing vector fields, or equivalently the space of all bounded vectors
in $\mathfrak{g}$ for $G/H$, is a compact Lie subalgebra, such that its semi-simple part is the ideal
$\mathfrak{c}_{\mathfrak{s}_c}(\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g}))$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, and its
Abelian part is the sum of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathfrak{c}(\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g}))} (\mathfrak{s}_{nc})$
and all two-dimensional irreducible $\mathrm{ad}(\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g}))$-representations
in $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathfrak{c}(\mathfrak{n})}(\mathfrak{s}_{nc})$ corresponding to nonzero
imaginary weights, i.e. $\mathbb{R}$-linear functionals $\lambda:\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g})\rightarrow
\mathfrak{r}(\mathfrak{g})/\mathfrak{n}(\mathfrak{g}) \rightarrow\mathbb{R}\sqrt{-1}$,
where $\mathfrak{n}(\mathfrak{g})$ is the nilradical.
