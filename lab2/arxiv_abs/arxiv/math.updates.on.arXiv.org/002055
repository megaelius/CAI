In this paper, we discuss the impact of some mortality data anomalies on an internal model capturing
longevity risk in the Solvency 2 framework. In particular, we are concerned with abnormal cohort
effects such as those for generations 1919 and 1920, for which the period tables provided by the Human
Mortality Database show particularly low and high mortality rates respectively. To provide corrected
tables for the three countries of interest here (France, Italy and West Germany), we use the approach
developed by Boumezoued (2016) for countries for which the method applies (France and Italy), and
provide an extension of the method for West Germany as monthly fertility histories are not sufficient
to cover the generations of interest. These mortality tables are crucial inputs to stochastic mortality
models forecasting future scenarios, from which the extreme 0,5% longevity improvement can be
extracted, allowing for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). More precisely,
to assess the impact of such anomalies in the Solvency II framework, we use a simplified internal
model based on three usual stochastic models to project mortality rates in the future combined with
a closure table methodology for older ages. Correcting this bias obviously improves the data quality
of the mortality inputs, which is of paramount importance today, and slightly decreases the capital
requirement. Overall, the longevity risk assessment remains stable, as well as the selection of
the stochastic mortality model. As a collateral gain of this data quality improvement, the more
regular estimated parameters allow for new insights and a refined assessment regarding longevity
risk.
