In real-world problems, uncertainties (e.g., errors in the measurement, precision errors) often
lead to poor performance of numerical algorithms when not explicitly taken into account. This is
also the case for control problems, where optimal solutions can degrade in quality or even become
infeasible. Thus, there is the need to design methods that can handle uncertainty. In this work,
we consider nonlinear multi-objective optimal control problems with uncertainty on the initial
conditions, and in particular their incorporation into a feedback loop via model predictive control
(MPC). In multi-objective optimal control, an optimal compromise between multiple conflicting
criteria has to be found. For such problems, not much has been reported in terms of uncertainties.
To address this problem class, we design an offline/online framework to compute an approximation
of efficient control strategies. This approach is closely related to explicit MPC for nonlinear
systems, where the potentially expensive optimization problem is solved in an offline phase in
order to enable fast solutions in the online phase. In order to reduce the numerical cost of the offline
phase, we exploit symmetries in the control problems. Furthermore, in order to ensure optimality
of the solutions, we include an additional online optimization step, which is considerably cheaper
than the original multi-objective optimization problem. We test our framework on a car maneuvering
problem where safety and speed are the objectives. The multi-objective framework allows for online
adaptations of the desired objective. Alternatively, an automatic scalarizing procedure yields
very efficient feedback controls. Our results show that the method is capable of designing driving
strategies that deal better with uncertainties in the initial conditions, which translates into
potentially safer and faster driving strategies.
