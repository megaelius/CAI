In this article, we derive statistical tools to analyze and distinguish the patterns of genetic
variability produced by classical and recent population genetic models related to seed banks.
In particular, we are concerned with models described by the Kingman coalescent (K), models exhibiting
so-called weak seed banks described by a time-changed Kingman coalescent (W), models with so-called
strong seed bank described by the seed bank coalescent (S) and the classical two-island model by
Wright, described by the structured coalescent (TI). As the presence of a (strong) seed bank should
stratify a population, we expect it to produce a signal roughly comparable to the presence of population
structure. We begin with a brief analysis of Wright's $F_{ST}$, which is a classical but crude measure
for population structure, followed by a derivation of the expected site frequency spectrum (SFS)
in the infinite sites model based on 'phase-type distribution calculus' as recently discussed
by Hobolth et al. (2019). Both the $F_{ST}$ and the SFS can be readily computed under various population
models, they discard statistical signal. Hence we also derive exact likelihoods for the full sampling
probabilities, which can be achieved via recursions and a Monte Carlo scheme both in the infinite
alleles and the infinite sites model. We employ a pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
of Andrieu and Roberts (2009) to provide a method for simultaneous model selection and parameter
inference under the so-called infinitely-many sites model, which is the most relevant in real applications.
It turns out that this full likelihood method can reliably distinguish among the model classes (K,
W), (S) and (TI) on the basis of simulated data even from moderate sample sizes. It is also possible
to infer mutation rates, and in particular determine whether mutation is taking place in the (strong)
seed bank.
