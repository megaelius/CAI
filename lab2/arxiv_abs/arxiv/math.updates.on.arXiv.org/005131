The conventional way of formulating inverse problems such as identification of a (possibly infinite
dimensional) parameter, is via some forward operator, which is the concatenation of the observation
operator with the parameter-to-state-map for the underlying model. Recently, all-at-once formulations
have been considered as an alternative to this reduced formulation, avoiding the use of a parameter-to-state
map, which would sometimes lead to too restrictive conditions. Here the model and the observation
are considered simultaneously as one large system with the state and the parameter as unknowns.
A still more general formulation of inverse problems, containing both the reduced and the all-at-once
formulation, but also the well-known and highly versatile so-called variational approach (also
called Kohn-Vogelius functional approach) as special cases, is to formulate the inverse problem
as a minimization problem -- instead of an equation -- for the state and parameter. Regularization
can be incorporated via imposing constraints and/or adding regularization terms to the objective.
In this paper, after giving a motivation by formulating the electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
problem by means of the classical Kohn-Vogelius functional, we will dwell on the regularization
aspects for such variational formulations in an abstract setting. Indeed, combination of regularization
by constraints and by penalization leads to new methods that are applicable without solving forward
problems. In particular, for the EIT problem we will consider a method employing box constraints
in a very natural manner to incorporate the discrepancy principle for regularization parameter
choice as well as a priori information on the searched for conductivity.
