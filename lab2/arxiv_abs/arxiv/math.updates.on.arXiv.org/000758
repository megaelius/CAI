The geometric mean method (GMM) and the eigenvector method (EM) are well-known approaches to deriving
information from pairwise comparison matrices in decision making processes. However, the original
algorithms of these methods are logically incomplete and have significant drawbacks: their actual
numerical errors are unknown and their reliability is doubted by different rank reversal phenomena
including the GMM-EM ones. Recently (Tomashevskii 2015: Eur J Oper Res 240:774-780), the actual
numerical errors were found for EM, and it was shown that all EM rank reversal phenomena have the same
cause and are eliminated when the errors are taken into account. In this paper the similar ap-proach
is used for GMM: we associate GMM with some standard measuring procedure, ana-lyze this procedure
from the viewpoint of measurement theory, and find the actual GMM errors. We show that the GMM and
the GMM-EM rank reversal phenomena are eliminated when the GMM and the EM errors are taken into account.
The GMM decision support tool, which has all components of a standard measuring tool, is composed
of pairwise comparisons as an initial measuring procedure, GMM as a data processor, and the obtained
formulas for GMM errors as an error indicator. This tool is analogous to the EM decision support tool
received earlier in the above paper. It is shown that the EM and the GMM versions of the tool are equally
suitable to measure and rank any comparable elements with positive numerical values. We also analyze
the Geometric Consistency Index usually used in the original GMM to measure of the inconsistency
and to accept or reject an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix, and show that this index is not
an acceptable GMM error indicator.
