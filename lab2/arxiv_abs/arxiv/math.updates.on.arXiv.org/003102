In locally compact, separable metric measure spaces, heat kernels can be classified as either local
(having exponential decay) or nonlocal (having polynomial decay). This dichotomy of heat kernels
gives rise to operators that include (but are not restricted to) the generators of the classical
Laplacian associated to Brownian processes as well as the fractional Laplacian associated with
$\beta$-stable L\'evy processes. Given embedded data that lie on or close to a compact Riemannian
manifold, there is a practical difficulty in realizing this theory directly since these kernels
are defined as functions of geodesic distance which is not directly accessible unless if the manifold
(i.e., the embedding function or the Riemannian metric) is completely specified. This paper develops
numerical methods to estimate the semigroups and generators corresponding to these heat kernels
using embedded data that lie on or close to a compact Riemannian manifold (the estimators of the local
kernels are restricted to Neumann functions for manifold with boundary). For local kernels, the
method is basically a version of the diffusion maps algorithm which estimates the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on compact Riemannian manifolds. For non-local heat kernels, the diffusion maps algorithm
must be modified in order to estimate fractional Laplacian operators using polynomial decaying
kernels. In this case, the graph distance is used to approximate the geodesic distance with appropriate
error bounds. Numerical experiments supporting these theoretical results are presented. For
manifolds with boundary, numerical results suggest that the proposed fractional diffusion maps
framework implemented with non-local kernels approximates the regional fractional Laplacian.
