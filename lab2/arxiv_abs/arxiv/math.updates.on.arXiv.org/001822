We study the problem of optimizing the betting frequency in a dynamic game setting using Kelly's
celebrated expected logarithmic growth criterion as the performance metric. The game is defined
by a sequence of bets with independent and identically distributed returns X(k). The bettor selects
the fraction of wealth K wagered at k = 0 and waits n steps before updating the bet size. Between updates,
the proceeds from the previous bets remain at risk in the spirit of "buy and hold." Within this context,
the main questions we consider are as follows: How does the optimal performance, we call it gn*, change
with n? Does the high-frequency case, n = 1, always lead to the best performance? What are the effects
of accrued interest and transaction costs? First, we provide rather complete answers to these questions
for the important special case when X(k) in {-1,1} is a Bernoulli random variable with probability
p that X(k) = 1. This serves as an entry point for future research using a binomial lattice model for
stock trading. The latter sections focus on more general probability distributions for X(k) and
two conjectures. The first conjecture is simple to state: Absent transaction costs, gn* is non-increasing
in n. The second conjecture involves the technical condition which we call the sufficient attractiveness
inequality. We first prove that satisfaction of this inequality is sufficient to guarantee that
the low-frequency bettor using large n can match the performance of the high-frequency bettor using
n = 1. Subsequently, we conjecture, and provide supporting evidence that this condition is also
necessary.
