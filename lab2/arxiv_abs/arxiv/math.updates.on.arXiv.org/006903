In this paper, a dense Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is considered in which a large number
of IoT devices contend for channel access so as to transmit timely status updates to the corresponding
receivers using a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme. Under two packet management schemes
with and without preemption in service, the closed-form expressions of the average age of information
(AoI) and the average peak AoI of each device is characterized. It is shown that the scheme with preemption
in service always leads to a smaller average AoI and a smaller average peak AoI, compared to the scheme
without preemption in service. Then, a distributed noncooperative medium access control game
is formulated in which each device optimizes its waiting rate so as to minimize its average AoI or
average peak AoI under an average energy cost constraint on channel sensing and packet transmitting.
To overcome the challenges of solving this game for an ultra-dense IoT, a mean-field game (MFG) approach
is proposed to study the asymptotic performance of each device for the system in the large population
regime. The accuracy of the MFG is analyzed, and the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of the
mean-field equilibrium (MFE) are investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed MFG
is accurate even for a small number of devices; and the proposed CSMA-type scheme under the MFG analysis
outperforms two baseline schemes with fixed and dynamic waiting rates, with the average AoI reductions
reaching up to 22% and 34%, respectively. Moreover, it is observed that the average AoI and the average
peak AoI under the MFE do not necessarily decrease with the arrival rate.
