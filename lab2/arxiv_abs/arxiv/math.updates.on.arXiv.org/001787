This work is the second of the series of three papers devoted to the study of asymptotic dynamics in
the chemotaxis system with space and time dependent logistic source,$$\partial_tu=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla
v)+u(a(x,t)-ub(x,t)),\quad 0=\Delta v-\lambda v+\mu u ,\ x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \ (1) $$where $N\ge1$
is a positive integer, $\chi,\lambda,\mu>0$, and the functions $a(x,t), b(x,t)$ are positive
and bounded. In the first of the series, we studied the phenomena of pointwise and uniform persistence,
and asymptotic spreading for solutions with compactly supported or front like initials. In the
second of the series, we investigate the existence, uniqueness and stability of strictly positive
entire solutions. In this direction, we prove that, if $0\le\mu\chi<b_\inf$, then (1) has a strictly
positive entire solution, which is time-periodic (respectively time homogeneous) when the logistic
source function is time-periodic (respectively time homogeneous). Next, we show that there is
positive constant $\chi_0$, such that for every $0\le\chi<\chi_0$, (1) has a unique positive entire
solution which is uniform and exponentially stable with respect to strictly positive perturbations.
In particular, we prove that $\chi_0$ can be taken to be $b_\inf/2\mu$ when the logistic source function
is either space homogeneous or the function $b(x,t)/a(x,t)$ is constant. We also investigate the
disturbances to Fisher-KKP dynamics caused by chemotatic effects, and prove that$$\sup_{0<\chi\le\chi_1}\sup_{t_0\in\mathbb{R},t\ge
0}\frac{1}{\chi}\|u_{\chi}(\cdot,t+t_0;t_0,u_0)-u_0(\cdot,t+t_0;t_0,u_0)\|_{\infty}<\infty$$for
every $0<\chi_1<b_\inf/\mu$ and every uniformly continuous initial function $u_0$, with $u_{0\inf}>0$,
where $(u_\chi(x,t+t_0;t_0,u_0),v_\chi(x,t+t_0;t_0,u_0))$ denotes the unique classical
solution of (1) with $u_\chi(x,t_0;t_0,u_0)=u_0(x)$, for every $0\le\chi<b_\inf$.
