In many image and signal processing applications, as interferometric synthetic aperture radar
(SAR), electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis or color image restoration in HSV or LCh spaces
the data has its range on the one-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^1$. Although the minimization of
total variation (TV) regularized functionals is among the most popular methods for edge-preserving
image restoration such methods were only very recently applied to cyclic structures. However,
as for Euclidean data, TV regularized variational methods suffer from the so called staircasing
effect. This effect can be avoided by involving higher order derivatives into the functional. This
is the first paper which uses higher order differences of cyclic data in regularization terms of
energy functionals for image restoration. We introduce absolute higher order differences for
$\mathbb S^1$-valued data in a sound way which is independent of the chosen representation system
on the circle. Our absolute cyclic first order difference is just the geodesic distance between
points. Similar to the geodesic distances the absolute cyclic second order differences have only
values in [0,{\pi}]. We update the cyclic variational TV approach by our new cyclic second order
differences. To minimize the corresponding functional we apply a cyclic proximal point method
which was recently successfully proposed for Hadamard manifolds. Choosing appropriate cycles
this algorithm can be implemented in an efficient way. The main steps require the evaluation of proximal
mappings of our cyclic differences for which we provide analytical expressions. Under certain
conditions we prove the convergence of our algorithm. Various numerical examples with artificial
as well as real-world data demonstrate the advantageous performance of our algorithm.
