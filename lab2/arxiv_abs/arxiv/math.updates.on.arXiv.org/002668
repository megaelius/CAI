We present an adaptive space-time mesh refinement approach based a domain decomposition approach
(Singh and Wheeler, 2018) that allows different time-step sizes and mesh refinements in different
subdomains. Our numerical experiments indicate that non-linear solvers fail to converge, to the
desired tolerance, due to large non-linear residuals in a smaller subdomain. We exploit this feature
to identify subdomains where smaller time-step sizes are necessary while using large time-step
sizes in the rest of the reservoir domain. The three key components of our approach are: (1) a space-time,
enhanced velocity, domain decomposition approach that allows different mesh refinements and
time-step sizes in different subdomains while preserving local mass conservation, (2) a residual
based error estimator to identify or mark regions (or subdomains) that pose non-linear convergence
issues, and (3) a fully coupled monolithic solver is also presented that solves the coarse and fine
subdomain problems, both in space and time, simultaneously. This solution scheme is fully implicit
and is therefore unconditionally stable. The proposed space-time domain decomposition approach,
with smaller time-step sizes in a subdomain and large time-step sizes everywhere else, circumvents
the non-linear convergence issue without adding computational costs. Additionally, a space-time
monolithic solver renders a massively parallel, time concurrent framework for solving flow and
transport problems in subsurface porous media. Since the proposed approach is similar to the widely
used finite difference scheme, it can be easily integrated in any existing legacy reservoir simulator.
