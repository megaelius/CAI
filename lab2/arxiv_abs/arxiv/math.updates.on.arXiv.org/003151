We study the regularity of the solutions of second order boundary value problems on manifolds with
boundary and bounded geometry. We first show that the regularity property of a given boundary value
problem $(P, C)$ is equivalent to the uniform regularity of the natural family $(P_x, C_x)$ of associated
boundary value problems in local coordinates. We verify that this property is satisfied for the
Dirichlet boundary conditions and strongly elliptic operators via a compactness argument. We
then introduce a uniform Shapiro-Lopatinski regularity condition, which is a modification of
the classical one, and we prove that it characterizes the boundary value problems that satisfy the
usual regularity property. We also show that the natural Robin boundary conditions always satisfy
the uniform Shapiro-Lopatinski regularity condition, provided that our operator satisfies the
strong Legendre condition. This is achieved by proving that "well-posedness implies regularity"
via a modification of the classical "Nirenberg trick". When combining our regularity results with
the Poincar\'e inequality of (Ammann-Grosse-Nistor, preprint 2015), one obtains the usual well-posedness
results for the classical boundary value problems in the usual scale of Sobolev spaces, thus extending
these important, well-known theorems from smooth, bounded domains, to manifolds with boundary
and bounded geometry. As we show in several examples, these results do not hold true anymore if one
drops the bounded geometry assumption. We also introduce a uniform Agmon condition and show that
it is equivalent to the coerciveness. Consequently, we prove a well-posedness result for parabolic
equations whose elliptic generator satisfies the uniform Agmon condition.
