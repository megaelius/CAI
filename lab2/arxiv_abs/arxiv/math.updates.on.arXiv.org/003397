Rigidity theory studies the properties of graphs that can have rigid embeddings in a euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$ or on a sphere and which in addition satisfy certain edge length constraints. One
of the major open problems in this field is to determine lower and upper bounds on the number of realizations
with respect to a given number of vertices. This problem is closely related to the classification
of rigid graphs according to their maximal number of real embeddings. In this paper, we are interested
in finding edge lengths that can maximize the number of real embeddings of minimally rigid graphs
in the plane, space, and on the sphere. We use algebraic formulations to provide upper bounds. To
find values of the parameters that lead to graphs with a large number of real realizations, possibly
attaining the (algebraic) upper bounds, we use some standard heuristics and we also develop a new
method inspired by coupler curves. We apply this new method to obtain embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
One of its main novelties is that it allows us to sample efficiently from a larger number of parameters
by selecting only a subset of them at each iteration. Our results include a full classification of
the 7-vertex graphs according to their maximal numbers of real embeddings in the cases of the embeddings
in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$, while in the case of $S^2$ we achieve this classification
for all 6-vertex graphs. Additionally, by increasing the number of embeddings of selected graphs,
we improve the previously known asymptotic lower bound on the maximum number of realizations. The
methods and the results concerning the spatial embeddings are part of the proceedings of ISSAC 2018
(Bartzos et al, 2018).
