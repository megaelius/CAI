The Chow ring was introduced in the 1930's but still there are few general results on the size of the
Chow ring of a smooth algebraic variety with rational or finite coefficients. Results by Mumford,
Schoen and Totaro indicate that the Chow ring $\operatorname{CH}^*(X)\otimes k$ where $X$ is a
complex algebraic manifold is infinite dimensional when $k$ is the field of rational numbers or
a finite field. In this note we prove that for any smooth complex algebraic variety $X$ with an open
affine subset $U=Spec(A)$ where $\operatorname{H}^2_{sing}(U, \mathbb{C})\neq 0$ and $A$ satisfies
the PBW-property, it follows the Chow ring $\operatorname{CH}^*(X)\otimes k$ is uncountably
infinite dimensional over $k$, where $k=\mathbb{Q}$ is the field of rational numbers or $k=\mathbb{F}_l$
for any prime number $l$. Here $\operatorname{H}^2_{sing}(U, \mathbb{C})$ is singular cohomology
of $U$ with complex coefficients. Note (october 2018): Some of the results on the size of the Chow
group and Grothendieck group in this paper rely on Corollary 5.7 in the paper "Algebraic connections
on projective modules..." (from J. Algebra no. 436 from 2015), and Corollary 5.7 has turned out to
be wrong. The family $V^{k,i}(A,L,f)$ from Lemma 2.9 in this paper does not give a family of connections
parametrized by $\operatorname{H}^2(L,A)$ as is claimed. This is related to the fact there are
few 2-sided ideals in the enveloping algebra $U(A,L(f))$: When $A$ is the polynomial ring, $L=\operatorname{Der}(A)$
and $f=0$ it follows $U(A,L(f))$ is the Weyl algebra, and the Weyl algebra has no non-trivial 2-sided
ideals. Hence the main results in Section 4 in this paper are therefore not correct. All general constructions
on universal enveloping algebras and characteristic classes in this paper are correct.
