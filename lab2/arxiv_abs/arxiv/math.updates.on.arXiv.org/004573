Several differential equations usually appearing in mathematical physics are solved through
a power series expansion, which reduces in solving difference equations. In this paper a probability
problem is presented whose solution follows a completely reversed but systematic approach. Hence,
this work is about illustrating how complex probability problems could be tackled with the more
powerful techniques of a better studied and well understood field, that of differential equations.
The problem is defined as follows: Inside a box containing r red and w white balls random removals
occur. The balls are removed successively according to the three following rules. Rule I: If a white
ball is chosen it is immediately discarded. If a red ball is chosen, it is placed back into the box and
a new ball is randomly chosen. The second ball is then removed irrespective of the color. Rule II:
Once one ball is removed, the game continues from Rule I. Rule III: The game ends once all the red balls
are removed. The question posed is the determination of the probability that k white balls remain
where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., w. Ending the game once all the white balls are removed, a second question is the
determination of the probability that k red balls remain where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., r. While inductive
solutions are possible, the current approach demonstrates a different and algorithmic route.
In particular, the law of total probability yields a recursion that is transformed into a linear
inhomogeneous 2D PDE, with suitable boundary conditions. The PDE solutions, which are found analytically,
provide the generating functionals of the required probabilities as a function of r, w and k. Using
the functionals, the probability formulas for any r, w and k are finally obtained in a closed form.
Reproducing existing results of the literature this method is quite generic and adaptable to a large
class of problems.
