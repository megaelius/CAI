Let $G$ be an algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $\mathtt{k}$ of characteristic
$p>0$. In this paper we develop the theory of character sheaves on groups $G$ such that their neutral
connected components $G^\circ$ are solvable algebraic groups. For such algebraic groups $G$ (which
we call neutrally solvable) we will define the set $\operatorname{CS}(G)$ of character sheaves
on $G$ as certain special (isomorphism classes of) objects in the category $\mathscr{D}_G(G)$
of $G$-equivariant $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-complexes (where we fix a prime $\ell\neq
p$) on $G$. We will describe a partition of the set $\operatorname{CS}(G)$ into finite sets known
as $\mathbb{L}$-packets and we will associate a modular category $\mathscr{M}_L$ with each $\mathbb{L}$-packet
$L$ of character sheaves using a truncated version of convolution of character sheaves. In the case
where $\mathtt{k}=\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$ and $G$ is equipped with an $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius
$F$ we will study the relationship between $F$-stable character sheaves on $G$ and the irreducible
characters of (all pure inner forms of) $G^F$. In particular, we will prove that the notion of almost
characters (introduced by T. Shoji using Shintani descent) is well defined for neutrally solvable
groups and that these almost characters coincide with the "trace of Frobenius" functions associated
with $F$-stable character sheaves. We will also prove that the matrix relating the irreducible
characters and almost characters is block diagonal where the blocks on the diagonal are parametrized
by $F$-stable $\mathbb{L}$-packets. Moreover, we will prove that the block in this transition
matrix corresponding to any $F$-stable $\mathbb{L}$-packet $L$ can be described as the crossed
S-matrix associated with the auto-equivalence of the modular category $\mathscr{M}_L$ induced
by $F$.
