We study a financial market where the risky asset is modelled by a geometric It\^o-L\'{e}vy process,
with a singular drift term. This can for example model a situation where the asset price is partially
controlled by a company which intervenes when the price is reaching a certain lower barrier. See
e.g. Jarrow & Protter for an explanation and discussion of this model in the Brownian motion case.
As already pointed out by Karatzas & Shreve (in the continuous setting), this allows for arbitrages
in the market. However, the situation in the case of jumps is not clear. Moreover, it is not clear what
happens if there is a delay in the system. In this paper we consider a jump diffusion market model with
a singular drift term modelled as the local time of a given process, and with a delay \theta>0 in the
information flow available for the trader. We allow the stock price dynamics to depend on both a continuous
process (Brownian motion) and a jump process (Poisson random measure). We believe that jumps and
delays are essential in order to get more realistic financial market models. Using white noise calculus
we compute explicitly the optimal consumption rate and portfolio in this case and we show that the
maximal value is finite as long as the delay \theta> 0. This implies that there is no arbitrage in the
market in that case. However, when \theta goes to 0, the value goes to infinity. This is in agreement
with the above result that is an arbitrage when there is no delay. Our model is also relevant for high
frequency trading issues. This is because high frequency trading often leads to intensive trading
taking place on close to infinitesimal lengths of time, which in the limit corresponds to trading
on time sets of measure 0. This may in turn lead to a singular drift in the pricing dynamics. See e.g.
Lachapelle et al and the references therein.
