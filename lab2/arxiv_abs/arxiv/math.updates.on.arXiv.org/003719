Consider a simplicial complex that allows for an embedding into $\mathbb{R}^d$. How many faces
of dimension $\frac{d}{2}$ or higher can it have? How dense can they be? This basic question goes
back to Descartes' "Lost Theorem" and Euler's work on polyhedra. Using it and other fundamental
combinatorial problems, we introduce a version of the K\"ahler package beyond positivity, allowing
us to prove the hard Lefschetz theorem for toric varieties (and beyond) even when the ample cone is
empty. A particular focus lies on replacing the Hodge-Riemann relations by a non-degeneracy relation
at torus-invariant subspaces, allowing us to state and prove a generalization of theorems of Hall
and Laman in the setting of toric varieties and, more generally, the face rings of Hochster, Reisner
and Stanley. This has several applications: - We fully characterize the possible face numbers of
simplicial rational homology spheres, resolving the $g$-conjecture of McMullen in full generality
and generalizing Stanley's earlier proof for simplicial polytopes. The same methods also verify
a conjecture of K\"uhnel: if $M$ is a triangulated closed $(d-1)$-manifold on $n$ vertices, then
\[\binom{d+1}{j}\mathrm{b}_{j-1}(M)\ \le \ \binom{n-d+j-2}{j}\ \quad \text{for}\ 1\le j\le
\frac{d}{2}.\] - We prove that for a simplicial complex that embeds into $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, the
number of $d$-dimensional simplices exceeds the number of $(d-1)$-dimensional simplices by a
factor of at most $d+2$. This generalizes a result going back to Descartes and Euler, and resolves
the Gr\"unbaum-Kalai-Sarkaria conjecture. We obtain from this a generalization of the celebrated
crossing lemma: For a map of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ into $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, the number of
pairwise intersections of $d$-simplices is at least \[\frac{f_d^{d+2}(\Delta)}{(d+3)^{d+2}f_{d-1}^{d+1}(\Delta)}\]
provided $f_d(\Delta)> (d+3)f_{d-1}(\Delta)$.
