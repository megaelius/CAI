Real-time remote estimation is critical for mission-critical applications including industrial
automation, smart grid, and the tactile Internet. In this paper, we propose a hybrid automatic repeat
request (HARQ)-based real-time remote estimation framework for linear time-invariant (LTI)
dynamic systems. Considering the estimation quality of such a system, there is a fundamental tradeoff
between the reliability and freshness of the sensor's measurement transmission. When a failed
transmission occurs, the sensor can either retransmit the previous old measurement such that the
receiver can obtain a more reliable old measurement, or transmit a new but less reliable measurement.
To design the optimal decision, we formulate a new problem to optimize the sensor's online decision
policy, i.e., to retransmit or not, depending on both the current estimation quality of the remote
estimator and the current number of retransmissions of the sensor, so as to minimize the long-term
remote estimation mean-squared error (MSE). This problem is non-trivial. In particular, it is
not clear what the condition is in terms of the communication channel quality and the LTI system parameters,
to ensure that the long-term estimation MSE can be bounded. We give a sufficient condition of the
existence of a stationary and deterministic optimal policy that stabilizes the remote estimation
system and minimizes the MSE. Also, we prove that the optimal policy has a switching structure, and
derive a low-complexity suboptimal policy. Our numerical results show that the proposed optimal
policy notably improves the performance of the remote estimation system compared to the conventional
non-HARQ policy.
