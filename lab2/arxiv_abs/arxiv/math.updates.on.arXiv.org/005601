Kaluza-Klein Theory states that a metric on the total space of a principal bundle $P\rightarrow
M$, if it is invariant under the principal action of $P$, naturally reduces to a metric together with
a gauge field on the base manifold $M$. We propose a generalization of this Kaluza-Klein principle
to higher principal bundles and higher gauge fields. For the particular case of the abelian gerbe
of Kalb-Ramond field, this Higher Kaluza-Klein geometry provides a natural global formulation
for Double Field Theory (DFT). In this framework the doubled space is the total space of a higher principal
bundle and the invariance under its higher principal action is exactly a global formulation of the
familiar strong constraint. The patching problem of DFT is naturally solved by gluing the doubled
space with a higher group of symmetries in a higher category. Locally we recover the familiar picture
of an ordinary para-Hermitian manifold equipped with Born geometry. Infinitesimally we recover
the familiar picture of a higher Courant algebroid twisted by a gerbe (also known as Extended Riemannian
Geometry). As first application we show that on a torus-compactified spacetime the Higher Kaluza-Klein
reduction gives automatically rise to abelian T-duality, while on a general principal bundle it
gives rise to non-abelian T-duality. As final application we define a natural notion of Higher Kaluza-Klein
monopole by directly generalizing the ordinary Gross-Perry one. Then we show that under Higher
Kaluza-Klein reduction, this monopole is exactly the NS5-brane on a $10d$ spacetime. If, instead,
we smear it along a compactified direction we recover the usual DFT monopole on a $9d$ spacetime.
