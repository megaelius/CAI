In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
high dimensional spiked sample covariance matrices, in the supercritical case when a reliable
detection of spikes is possible. Especially, we derive the joint distribution of the extreme eigenvalues
and the generalized components of the associated eigenvectors, i.e., the projections of the eigenvectors
onto arbitrary given direction, assuming that the dimension and sample size are comparably large.
In general, the joint distribution is given in terms of linear combinations of finitely many Gaussian
and Chi-square variables, with parameters depending on the projection direction and the spikes.
Our assumption on the spikes is fully general. First, the strengths of spikes are only required to
be slightly above the critical threshold and no upper bound on the strengths is needed. Second, multiple
spikes i.e., spikes with the same strength, are allowed. Third, no structural assumption is imposed
on the spikes. Thanks to the general setting, we can then apply the results to various high dimensional
statistical hypothesis testing problems involving both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Specifically,
we propose accurate and powerful statistics to conduct hypothesis testing on the principal components.
These statistics are data-dependent and adaptive to the underlying true spikes. Numerical simulations
also confirm the accuracy and powerfulness of our proposed statistics and illustrate significantly
better performance compared to the existing methods in the literature. Especially, our methods
are accurate and powerful even when either the spikes are small or the dimension is large.
