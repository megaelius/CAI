This work is focused on the entropy analysis of a semi-discrete nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral
element method (DGSEM) on moving meshes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The DGSEM is constructed
with a local tensor-product Lagrange-polynomial basis computed from Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto
(LGL) points. Furthermore, the collocation of interpolation and quadrature nodes is used in the
spatial discretization. This approach leads to discrete derivative approximations in space that
are summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. On a static mesh, the SBP property and suitable two-point
flux functions, which satisfy the entropy condition from Tadmor, allow to mimic results from the
continuous entropy analysis on the discrete level. In this paper, Tadmor's condition is extended
to the moving mesh framework. Based on the moving mesh entropy condition, entropy conservative
two-point flux functions for the homogeneous shallow water equations and the compressible Euler
equations are constructed. Furthermore, it will be proven that the semi-discrete moving mesh DGSEM
is an entropy conservative scheme when a two-point flux function, which satisfies the moving mesh
entropy condition, is applied in the split form DG framework. This proof does not require any exactness
of quadrature in the spatial integrals of the variational form. Nevertheless, entropy conservation
is not sufficient to tame discontinuities in the numerical solution and thus the entropy conservative
moving mesh DGSEM is modified by adding numerical dissipation matrices to the entropy conservative
fluxes. Then, the method becomes entropy stable such that the discrete mathematical entropy is
bounded at any time by its initial and boundary data when the boundary conditions are specified appropriately.
The theoretical properties of the moving mesh DGSEM will be validated by numerical experiments
for the compressible Euler equations.
