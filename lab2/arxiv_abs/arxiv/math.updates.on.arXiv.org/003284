The false discovery rate (FDR) is a popular error criterion for multiple testing, but it has been
criticized for lacking flexibility. A target FDR level $q$ must be set in advance, and the resulting
rejection set cannot be contracted or expanded without invalidating FDR control. In exploratory
settings, it is desirable to allow the experimenter more freedom to choose a rejection set, while
still preserving some Type-I error guarantees. In this paper, we show that the entire path of rejection
sets considered by a variety of existing FDR procedures (like BH, knockoffs, and many others) can
be endowed with simultaneous high-probability bounds on FDP. The path can be defined based on either
the p-values themselves, side information, or a combination of the two. FDR procedures maintain
an estimate of FDP for each rejection set on the path, stopping when this estimate exceeds $q$. We
show that inflating this FDP estimate by a small, explicit, multiplicative constant bounds the
FDP with high probability across the entire path. These results allow the scientist to $\textit{spot}$
one or more suitable rejection sets (Select Post hoc On the algorithm's Trajectory) as they wish,
for example by picking a data-dependent size or error level, after examining the FDP bounds for the
whole path, and still get a valid high probability FDP bound on the chosen set. Bounding the FDP simultaneously
for a selected path of rejection sets (simultaneous selective inference) can be a fruitful middle
ground between fully simultaneous inference (guarantees for all possible rejection sets), and
fully selective inference (guarantees only for one rejection set).
