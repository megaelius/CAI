We explore a general truncation scheme for the approximation of (possibly unstable) optimal filters.
In particular, let $\mS = (\pi_0,\kappa_t,g_t)$ be a state space model defined by a prior distribution
$\pi_0$, Markov kernels $\{\kappa_t\}_{t\ge 1}$ and potential functions $\{g_t\}_{t \ge 1}$,
and let $\sfc = \{C_t\}_{t\ge 1}$ be a sequence of compact subsets of the state space. In the first
part of the manuscript, we describe a systematic procedure to construct a system $\mS^\sfc=(\pi_0,\kappa_t^\sfc,g_t^\sfc)$,
where each potential $g_t^\sfc$ is truncated to have null value outside the set $C_t$, such that
the optimal filters generated by $S$ and $S^\sfc$ can be made arbitrarily close, with approximation
errors independent of time $t$. Then, in a second part, we investigate the stability of the approximately-optimal
filters. Specifically, given a system $\mS$ with a prescribed prior $\pi_0$, we seek sufficient
conditions to guarantee that the truncated system $\mS^\sfc$ (with {\em the same} prior $\pi_0$)
generates a sequence of optimal filters which are stable and, at the same time, can attain arbitrarily
small approximation errors. Besides the design of approximate filters, the methods and results
obtained in this paper can be applied to determine whether a prescribed system $\mS$ yields a sequence
of stable filters and to investigate topological properties of classes of optimal filters. As an
example of the latter, we explicitly construct a metric space $(\mfS,D_q)$, where $\mfS$ is a class
of state space systems and $D_q$ is a proper metric on $\mfS$, which contains a dense subset $\mfS_0
\subset \mfS$ such that every element $\mS_0 \in \mfS_0$ is a state space system yielding a stable
sequence of optimal filters.
