In this paper and the companion paper [EJE2], we establish finite-time singularity formation for
finite-energy strong solutions to the axi-symmetric $3D$ Euler equations in the domain $\{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3:z^2\leq
c(x^2+y^2)\}$ for some $c>0$. In the spirit of our previous works, [EJSI] and [EJB], we do this by
first studying scale-invariant solutions which satisfy a one dimensional PDE system and proving
that they may become singular in finite time for properly chosen initial data. We then prove local
well-posedness for the $3D$ Euler equations in a natural regularity class which includes scale-invariant
solutions. While these solutions have uniformly bounded vorticity from time zero until right before
the blow-up time, they do not have finite energy. To remedy this, we cut off the scale-invariant data
to ensure finite energy and prove that the corresponding local solution must also become singular
in finite time. This paper focuses only on the analysis of the scale-invariant solutions themselves
and the proof that they can become singular in finite time. The local well-posedness theorem and
the cut-off argument are very close to those in [JSI] and [EJB] and are left for the companion paper
[EJE2]. It is important to remark that while the fluid domain is the exterior of a cone, we prove global
regularity for the axi-symmetric $3D$ Euler equations without swirl in the exact same regularity
classes and in the same domain. It is quite possible that the methods we use can be adapted to establish
finite-time singularity formation for $C^\infty$ finite-energy solutions to the $3D$ Euler equations
on $\mathbb{R}^3_+$.
