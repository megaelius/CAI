In this article I present results from a statistical study of prime numbers that shows a behaviour
that is not compatible with the thesis that they are distributed randomly. The analysis is based
on studying two arithmetical progressions defined by the following polynomials: ($1+6n$, $5+6n$,
$n\in{N}$) whose respective numerical sequences have the characteristic of containing all the
prime numbers except $3$ and $2$. If prime numbers were distributed randomly, we would expect the
two polynomials to generate the same number of primes. Instead, as the reported findings show, we
note that the polynomial $5+6n$ tends to generate many more primes, and that this divergence grows
progressively as more prime numbers are considered. A possible explanation for this phenomenon
can be found by calculating the number of products that generate composite numbers which are expressible
by the two polynomials. This analysis reveals that the number of products that generate composite
numbers expressible by the polynomial $1+6n$ is $(n+1)^{ 2}$, while the number of products that
generate composites expressible by the polynomial $5+6n$ is $(n+1)n$, con $n\in{N}$. As a composite
number is a non-prime number, this difference incited me to analyse the distribution of prime numbers
generated by the two polynomials. The results, based on studying the first (approx.) 500 million
prime numbers, confirm the fact that the number of primes that can be written using the polynomial
$1+6n$ is lower than the number of primes that can written using the polynomial $5+6n$, and that this
divergence grows progressively with the number of primes considered.
