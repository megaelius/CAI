Safety and automatic control are extremely important when operating manipulators. For large engineering
manipulators, the main challenge is to accurately recognize the posture of all arm segments. In
classical sensing methods, the accuracy of an inclinometer is easily affected by the elastic deformation
in the manipulator's arms. This results in big error accumulations when sensing the angle of joints
between arms one by one. In addition, the sensing method based on machine vision is not suitable for
such kind of outdoor working situation yet. In this paper, we propose a novel posture positioning
method for multi-joint manipulators based on wireless sensor network localization. The posture
sensing problem is formulated as a Nearest-Euclidean-Distance-Matrix (NEDM) model. The resulting
approach is referred to as EDM-based posture positioning approach (EPP) and it satisfies the following
guiding principles: (i) The posture of each arm segment on a multi-joint manipulator must be estimated
as accurately as possible; (ii) The approach must be computationally fast; (iii) The designed approach
should not be susceptible to obstructions. To further improve accuracy, we explore the inherent
structure of manipulators, i.e., fixed-arm length. This is naturally presented as linear constraints
in the NEDM model. For concrete pumps, a typical multi-joint manipulator, the mechanical property
that all arm segments always lie in a 2D plane is used for dimension-reduction operation. Simulation
and experimental results show that the proposed method provides efficient solutions for posture
sensing problem and can obtain preferable localization performance with faster speed than applying
the existing localization methods.
