This paper aims to study in more depth the relation between growth in matrix groups ${{\rm SL_2}}(\mathbf{F})$
and ${{\rm Aff}}(\mathbf{F})$ over a field $\mathbf{F}$ by multiplication and geometric incidence
estimates, associated with the sum-product phenomenon over $\mathbf{F}$. It presents streamlined
proofs of Helfgott's theorems on growth in the $\mathbf{F}_p$-case, which avoid sum-product estimates.
For ${{\rm SL_2}}(\mathbf{F}_p)$, for sets exceeding in size some absolute constant, we improve
the lower bound $\frac{1}{1512}$ for the growth exponent, due to Kowalski, to $\frac{1}{21}.$
For the affine group we fetch a sharp theorem of Sz\H{o}nyi on the number of directions, determined
by a point set in $\mathbf{F}_p^2$. We then focus on ${{\rm Aff}}(\mathbf{F})$ and present a new
incidence bound between a set of points and a set of lines in $\mathbf{F}^2$, which explicitly depends
on the energy of the set of lines as affine transformations under composition. This bound, strong
when the number of lines is considerably smaller than the number of points, yields generalizations
of structural theorems of Elekes and Murphy on rich lines in grids. In the special case when the set
of lines is also a grid -- relating back to sum-products -- we use growth in ${{\rm Aff}}(\mathbf{R})$
to obtain a subthreshold estimate on the energy of the set of lines. This yields a unified way to break
the ice in various threshold sum-product type energy inequalities. We show this in applications
to energy estimates, corresponding to sets $A(A+ A)$, $A+AA$ (also embracing asymmetric versions)
as well as $A+B$ when $A$ has small multiplicative doubling and $\sqrt{|A|} \le |B|\le|A|^{1+o(1)}$.
