We study the problem of approximating the value of the matching polynomial on graphs with edge parameter
$\gamma$, where $\gamma$ takes arbitrary values in the complex plane. When $\gamma$ is a positive
real, Jerrum and Sinclair showed that the problem admits an FPRAS on general graphs. For general
complex values of $\gamma$, Patel and Regts, building on methods developed by Barvinok, showed
that the problem admits an FPTAS on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ as long as $\gamma$ is not a negative
real number less than or equal to $-1/(4(\Delta-1))$. Our first main result completes the picture
for the approximability of the matching polynomial on bounded degree graphs. We show that for all
$\Delta\geq 3$ and all real $\gamma$ less than $-1/(4(\Delta-1))$, the problem of approximating
the value of the matching polynomial on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ with edge parameter $\gamma$
is #P-hard. We then explore whether the maximum degree parameter can be replaced by the connective
constant. Sinclair et al. showed that for positive real $\gamma$ it is possible to approximate the
value of the matching polynomial using a correlation decay algorithm on graphs with bounded connective
constant (and potentially unbounded maximum degree). We first show that this result does not extend
in general in the complex plane; in particular, the problem is #P-hard on graphs with bounded connective
constant for a dense set of $\gamma$ values on the negative real axis. Nevertheless, we show that
the result does extend for any complex value $\gamma$ that does not lie on the negative real axis.
Our analysis accounts for complex values of $\gamma$ using geodesic distances in the complex plane
in the metric defined by an appropriate density function.
