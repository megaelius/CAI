The theory of fractional calculus has developed in a number of directions over the years, including:
the formulation of multiple different definitions of fractional differintegration; the extension
of various properties of standard calculus into the fractional scenario; the application of fractional
differintegrals to assorted special functions. Recently, a new variant of fractional calculus
has arisen, namely incomplete fractional calculus. In two very recent papers, incomplete versions
of the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional differintegrals have been formulated and applied
to several important special functions. In the current work, we develop the theory of incomplete
fractional calculus in more depth, investigating further properties of the incomplete Riemann-Liouville
fractional differintegrals and answering some fundamental questions about these operators.
By considering appropriate function spaces, we formulate rigorously the definitions of incomplete
Riemann-Liouville fractional integration, and justify how this model may be used to analyse a wider
class of functions than classical fractional calculus. By using analytic continuation, we formulate
definitions for incomplete Riemann-Liouville fractional differentiation, hence extending
the incomplete integrals to a fully-fledged model of fractional calculus. We also investigate
and analyse these operators further, in order to prove new properties. These include a Leibniz rule
for incomplete differintegrals of products, and composition properties of incomplete differintegrals
with classical calculus operations. These are natural and expected issues to investigate in any
new model of fractional calculus, and in the incomplete Riemann-Liouville model the results emerge
naturally from the definition previously proposed.
