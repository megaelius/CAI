This paper formulates the pose estimation problem as nonlinear stochastic filter kinematics evolved
directly on the Special Euclidean Group SE(3). Proposed filter guarantees that the errors present
in position and Rodriguez vector estimates are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB)
in mean square, and that they converge to small neighborhood of the origin in probability. Simulation
results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed filter in presence of high levels
of noise and bias associated with the velocity vector as well as body-frame measurements. Keywords:
