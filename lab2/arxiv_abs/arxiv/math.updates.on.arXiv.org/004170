This is a study of S. Kripke's notion of fulfilment. Motivated by Paris-Harrington statement, Kripke
was looking for a proof of G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorem which was model-theoretic, natural
(without self-reference), and easy. Fulfilment gives a versatile tool for both Proof and Model
Theory. We begin with short proofs to a number of classical results. With two new results: there is
an easily definable subring $R$ of the primitive recursive functions such that for any non-principal
ultrafilter $D$ on $\omega$, $R/D$ is a recursively saturated model of Peano arithmetic; and for
any r.e. theory $\textsf{T}$ and for any given r.e. set, we can feasibly find a $\Sigma_1^0$ formula
which semi-represents it in $\textsf{T}$. We then give a version of Herbrand's Theorem, and of the
Hilbert-Ackermann method of proving consistency, answering a problem of D. Guaspari:\[\{\ulcorner\phi\urcorner\in\Pi^0_k:\phi\text{
is }\Sigma^0_k\text{-conservative over $\textsf{PA}$}\}\]is a complete $\Pi^0_2$ set. We extend
H. Friedman's method for results of such as $\Sigma^1_2\textsf{-AC}$ is $\Pi^1_3$-conservative
over $(\Pi^1_1\textsf{-CA})_{<\varepsilon_0}\upharpoonright$, along with uniform versions\[\forall\alpha<\varepsilon_0\;(\Pi^1_1\textsf{-CA})_{\alpha}\upharpoonright\,\vdash\textsf{RFN}_{\Pi^1_3}({\Sigma^1_2}\textsf{-AC})\]
Then there are some model-theoretic applications, starting with non-$\omega$-models. We extend
the theorem of D. Scott involving Weak K\"onig's Lemma, and describe the order types of elementary
initial segments of recursively saturated models. For $\omega$-models, we extend Friedman's
theorem on minimal models of analysis, and develop indicators for countable fragments of $\mathcal
L_{\infty\omega}$, with some representability results in $\omega$-logic. We close with an exposition
of the Paris-Harrington statement.
