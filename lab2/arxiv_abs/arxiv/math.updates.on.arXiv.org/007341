We study the phenomenon of intransitivity in models of dice and voting. First, we follow a recent
thread of research for $n$-sided dice with pairwise ordering induced by the probability, relative
to $1/2$, that a throw from one die is higher than the other. We build on a recent result of Polymath
showing that three dice with i.i.d. faces drawn from the uniform distribution on $\{1,\ldots,n\}$
and conditioned on the average of faces equal to $(n+1)/2$ are intransitive with asymptotic probability
$1/4$. We show that if dice faces are drawn from a non-uniform continuous mean zero distribution
conditioned on the average of faces equal to $0$, then three dice are transitive with high probability.
We also extend our results to stationary Gaussian dice, whose faces, for example, can be the fractional
Brownian increments with Hurst index $H\in(0,1)$. Second, we pose an analogous model in the context
of Condorcet voting. We consider $n$ voters who rank $k$ alternatives independently and uniformly
at random. The winner between each two alternatives is decided by a majority vote based on the preferences.
We show that in this model, if all pairwise elections are close to tied, then the asymptotic probability
of obtaining any tournament on the $k$ alternatives is equal to $2^{-k(k-1)/2}$, which markedly
differs from known results in the model without conditioning. We also explore the Condorcet voting
model where methods other than simple majority are used for pairwise elections. We investigate
some natural definitions of "close to tied" for general functions and exhibit an example where the
distribution over tournaments is not uniform under those definitions.
