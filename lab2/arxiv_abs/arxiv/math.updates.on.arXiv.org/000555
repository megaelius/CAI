In 1990 Bender, Canfield and McKay gave an asymptotic formula for the number of connected graphs
on $[n]$ with $m$ edges, whenever $n$ and the nullity $m-n+1$ tend to infinity. Asymptotic formulae
for the number of connected $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $[n]$ with nullity $t=(r-1)m-n+1$, where
$m$ is the number of edges, were proved by Karo\'nski and \L uczak for the case $t=o(\log n/\log\log
n)$, and Behrisch, Coja-Oghlan and Kang for $t=\Theta(n)$. Here we prove such a formula for any $r\ge
3$ fixed, and any $t=t(n)$ satisfying $t=o(n)$ and $t\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$. This leaves open
only the (much simpler) case $t/n\to\infty$, which we will consider in future work. Our approach
is probabilistic. Let $H^r_{n,p}$ denote the random $r$-uniform hypergraph on $[n]$ in which each
edge is present independently with probability $p$. Let $L_1$ and $M_1$ be the numbers of vertices
and edges in the largest component of $H^r_{n,p}$. We prove a local limit theorem giving an asymptotic
formula for the probability that $L_1$ and $M_1$ take any given pair of values within the `typical'
range, for any $p=p(n)$ in the supercritical regime, i.e., when $p=p(n)=(1+\epsilon(n))(r-2)!n^{-r+1}$
where $\epsilon^3n\to\infty$ and $\epsilon\to 0$; our enumerative result then follows easily.
Taking as a starting point the recent joint central limit theorem for $L_1$ and $M_1$, we use smoothing
techniques to show that `nearby' pairs of values arise with about the same probability, leading
to the local limit theorem. Behrisch et al used similar ideas in a very different way, that does not
seem to work in our setting. Independently, Sato and Wormald have recently proved the special case
$r=3$ of our result, with an additional restriction on $t$. They use complementary, more enumerative
methods, which seem to have a more limited scope, but to give additional information when they do
work.
