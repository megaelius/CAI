Existence and uniqueness of rotating fluid bodies in equilibrium is still poorly understood in
General Relativity (GR). Apart from the limiting case of infinitely thin disks, the only known global
results in the stationary rotating case (Heilig [14] and Makino [21] [arXiv:1705.07392]) show
existence in GR nearby a Newtonian configuration (under suitable additional restrictions). In
this work we prove existence and uniqueness of rigidly (slowly) rotating fluid bodies in equilibrium
to second order in perturbation theory in GR. The most widely used perturbation framework to describe
slowly rigidly rotating stars in the strong field regime is the Hartle-Thorne model. The model involves
a number of hypotheses, some explicit, like equatorial symmetry or that the perturbation parameter
is proportional to the rotation, but some implicit, particularly on the structure and regularity
of the perturbation tensors and the conditions of their matching at the surface. In this work, with
basis on the gauge results obtained in [25], the Hartle-Thorne model is fully derived from first
principles and only assuming that the perturbations describe a rigidly rotating finite perfect
fluid ball (with no layer at the surface) with the same barotropic equation of state as the static
ball. Rigidly rotating fluid balls are analyzed consistently in second order perturbation theory
by imposing only basic differentiability requirements and boundedness. Our results prove in particular
that, at this level of approximation, the spacetime must be indeed equatorially symmetric and is
fully determined by two parameters, namely the central pressure and the uniform angular velocity
of the fluid.
