Motivated by multi-user optimization problems and non-cooperative Nash games in uncertain regimes,
we consider stochastic Cartesian variational inequalities (SCVI) where the set is given as the
Cartesian product of a collection of component sets. First, we consider the case where the number
of the component sets is large. For solving this type of problems, the classical stochastic approximation
methods and their prox generalizations are computationally inefficient as each iteration becomes
very costly. To address this challenge, we develop a randomized block stochastic mirror-prox (B-SMP)
algorithm, where at each iteration only a randomly selected block coordinate of the solution is
updated through implementing two consecutive projection steps. Under standard assumptions on
the problem and settings of the algorithm, we show that when the mapping is strictly pseudo-monotone,
the algorithm generates a sequence of iterates that converges to the solution of the problem almost
surely. To derive rate statements, we assume that the maps are strongly pseudo-monotone and obtain
{a non-asymptotic mean squared error $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{d}{k}\right)$, where $k$ is the
iteration number and $d$ is the number of component sets. Second, we consider large-scale stochastic
optimization problems with convex objectives. For this class of problems, we develop a new averaging
scheme for the B-SMP algorithm. Unlike the classical averaging stochastic mirror-prox (SMP) method
where a decreasing set of weights for the averaging sequence is used, here we consider a different
set of weights that are characterized in terms of the stepsizes and a {parameter}. We show that using
such weights, the objective values of the averaged sequence converges to the optimal value in the
mean sense with the rate $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\sqrt{k}}\right)$.
