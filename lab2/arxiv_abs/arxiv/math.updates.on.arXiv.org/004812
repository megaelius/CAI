A subset $X$ of a cardinal $\kappa$ is Ramsey if for every partition $f:[X]^{<\omega}\to 2$ there
is a set $H\subseteq X$ of cardinality $\kappa$ which is \emph{homogeneous} for $f$, meaning that
$f\upharpoonright[H]^n$ is constant for each $n<\omega$. Baumgartner proved [Colloq. Math.
Soc. J\'aons Bolyai, Vol. 10 (1975), MR0384553] that if $\kappa$ is Ramsey, then the collection
of non-Ramsey subsets of $\kappa$ is a normal ideal on $\kappa$. Bagaria [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.,
371(3):1981-2002 (2019), MR3894041], extended the notion of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability where
$n<\omega$ to that of $\Pi^1_\xi$-indescribability where $\xi$ can be any ordinal. We study large
cardinal properties and ideals which result from Ramseyness properties in which homogeneous sets
are demanded to be $\Pi^1_\xi$-indescribable. By iterating Feng's Ramsey operator [Ann. Pure
Appl. Logic, 49(3):257-277 (1990), MR1077260] on the various $\Pi^1_\xi$-indescribability
ideals, we obtain new large cardinal hierarchies and corresponding increasing hierarchies of
normal ideals. For example, we show that, given any ordinals $\beta_0,\beta_1<\kappa$ the increasing
chains of ideals obtained by iterating the Ramsey operator on the $\Pi^1_{\beta_0}$-indescribability
ideal and the $\Pi^1_{\beta_1}$-indescribability ideal respectively, are eventually equal;
moreover, we identify the least degree of Ramseyness at which this equality occurs. We provide a
complete account of the containment structure of the resulting ideals and show that the corresponding
large cardinal properties yield a strict linear refinement of Feng's original Ramsey hierarchy.
As an application we show that one can characterize all relevant large cardinal properties, such
as $\Pi^1_\xi$-indescribability, Ramseyness, as well as our new large cardinal notions and the
corresponding ideals in terms of generic elementary embeddings.
