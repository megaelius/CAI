Stationarity is a very general, qualitative assumption, that can be assessed on the basis of application
specifics. It is thus a rather attractive assumption to base statistical analysis on, especially
for problems for which less general qualitative assumptions, such as independence or finite memory,
clearly fail. However, it has long been considered too general to allow for statistical inference
to be made. One of the reasons for this is that rates of convergence, even of frequencies to the mean,
are not available under this assumption alone. Recently, it has been shown that, while some natural
and simple problems such as homogeneity, are indeed provably impossible to solve if one only assumes
that the data is stationary (or stationary ergodic), many others can be solved using rather simple
and intuitive algorithms. The latter problems include clustering and change point estimation.
In this volume I summarize these results. The emphasis is on asymptotic consistency, since this
the strongest property one can obtain assuming stationarity alone. While for most of the problems
for which a solution is found this solution is algorithmically realizable, the main objective in
this area of research, the objective which is only partially attained, is to understand what is possible
and what is not possible to do for stationary time series. The considered problems include homogeneity
testing, clustering with respect to distribution, clustering with respect to independence, change-point
estimation, identity testing, and the general question of composite hypotheses testing. For the
latter problem, a topological criterion for the existence of a consistent test is presented. In
addition, several open questions are discussed.
