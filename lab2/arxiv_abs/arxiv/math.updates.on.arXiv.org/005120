The active subspace method, as a dimension reduction technique, can substantially reduce computational
costs and is thus attractive for high-dimensional computer simulations. The theory provides upper
bounds for the mean square error of a given function of interest and a low-dimensional approximation
of it. Derivations are based on probabilistic Poincar\'e inequalities which strongly depend on
an underlying probability distribution that weights sensitivities of the investigated function.
It is not this original distribution that is crucial for final error bounds, but a conditional distribution,
conditioned on a so-called active variable, that naturally arises in the context. Existing literature
does not take this aspect into account, is thus missing important details when it comes to distributions
with, for example, exponential tails, and, as a consequence, does not cover such distributions
theoretically. Here, we consider scenarios in which traditional estimates are not valid anymore
due to an arbitrary large Poincar\'e constant. Additionally, we propose a framework that allows
to get weaker, or generalized, estimates and that enables the practitioner to control the trade-off
between the size of the Poincar\'e type constant and a weaker order of the final error bound. In particular,
we investigate independently exponentially distributed random variables in $2$ and $n$ dimensions
and give explicit expressions for involved constants, also showing the dependence on the dimension
of the problem. Finally, we formulate an open problem to the community that aims for extending the
class of distributions applicable to the active subspace method as we regard this as an opportunity
to enlarge its usability.
