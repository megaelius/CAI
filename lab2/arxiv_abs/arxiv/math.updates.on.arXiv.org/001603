In this article we prove in the main Theorem $A$ that for a given finite set of normal vectors which
are maximally linearly independent, any hyperplane arrangement over a field $\mathbb{F}$ with
$1-ad$ structure (refer to Definition $1$) can be isomorphically represented by the given set of
normals if and only if there is a convex positive bijection (refer to Definition $7$) between an associated
set of normal antipodal pairs of $\mathbb{F}-$vectors (refer to Note $3$) of the arrangement and
a set of antipodal pairs of $\mathbb{F}-$vectors that arise from the normals themselves. In particular
in dimension two any line arrangement can be represented isomorphically by lines with any given
set of distinct slopes of the same cardinality. As a consequence we have a coarse classification
where we show that there is a bijection between isomorphism classes of $\mathbb{K}-$hyperplane
arrangements of a fixed cardinality modulo translations and isomorphism classes on $\mathbb{K}-$normal
systems of the same fixed cardinality for any dense subfield $\mathbb{K}\subset \mathbb{F}$ (refer
to Theorem $6$ and Note $12$). Later we prove that for a fixed normal system in $\mathbb{R}^m$ there
is a bijective correspondence between isomorphism classes of hyperplane arrangements under isomorphisms
which are trivial on subscripts and convex cones of its corresponding concurrency arrangement
modulo reflection about the origin in Theorem $10$. In this process we prove an useful result $9$
that a line arrangement in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is determined by its three gonalities under isomorphisms
which are trivial on subscripts when lines are indexed in the increasing order of angles. Finally
in the addendum section we give a formula which depends only on the combinatorics enumerating certain
type of isomorphism classes of hyperplane arrangements answering an enumeration problem of line
arrangements as well.
