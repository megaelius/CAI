The performance of finite element solvers on modern computer architectures is typically memory
bound for sufficiently large problems. The main cause for this is that loading matrix elements from
RAM into CPU cache is significantly slower than performing the arithmetic operations when solving
the problem. In order to improve the performance of iterative solvers within the high-performance
computing context, so-called matrix-free methods are widely adopted in the fluid mechanics community,
where matrix-vector products are computed on-the-fly. To date, there have been few (if any) assessments
into the applicability of the matrix-free approach to problems in solid mechanics. In this work,
we perform an initial investigation on the application of the matrix-free approach to problems
in quasi-static finite-strain hyperelasticity to determine whether it is viable for further extension.
Specifically, we study different numerical implementations of the finite element tangent operator,
and determine whether generalized methods of incorporating complex constitutive behavior might
be feasible. In order to improve the convergence behavior of iterative solvers, we also propose
a method by which to construct level tangent operators and employ them to define a geometric multigrid
preconditioner. The performance of the matrix-free operator and the geometric multigrid preconditioner
is compared to the matrix-based implementation with an algebraic multigrid preconditioner on
a single node for a representative numerical example of a heterogeneous hyperelastic material
in two and three dimensions. We conclude that the application of matrix-free methods to finite-strain
solid mechanics is promising, and that is it possible to develop numerically efficient implementations
that are independent of the hyperelastic constitutive law.
