In this paper, we are concerned with the standing waves for the following nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger
equation $$i\partial_{t}\psi=-\Delta \psi+b^2(x_1^2+x_2^2)\psi+\frac{\lambda_1}{|x|}\psi+
\lambda_2(|\cdot|^{-1}\ast |\psi|^2)\psi- \lambda_3|\psi|^p \psi,~~~ (t,x)\in \mathbb{R}^+\times
\mathbb{R}^3,$$ where $0<p<4$. We mainly study the existence and stability/instability properties
of standing waves for this equation, in two cases: the first one is that no magnetic potential is involved,
(i.e. $b=0$ in the equation) and the second one is that $b\neq 0$. To be precise, in the first case,
by considering a minimization problem on a suitable Pohozaev manifold we prove the existence of
ground states, and show further that all ground state standing waves are strongly unstable by blow-up
in finite time. Moreover, by making use of the ideas of their proofs, we are able to prove the existence
and instability of normalized solutions, whose proofs seem to be new, compared with the studies
of normalized solutions in the existing literature. In the second case, the situation is more difficult
to be treated, due to the additional term of the partial harmonic potential. We manage to prove the
existence of stable standing waves for $p\in (0,4)$ and with some assumptions on the coefficients,
where solutions are obtained as global minimizers if $p\in (0,\frac{4}{3}]$, and as local minimizers
if $p\in [\frac{4}{3}, 4)$. In the mass-critical and supercritical cases $p\in [\frac{4}{3},
4)$, we establish the variational characterization of the ground states on a suitable manifold
which is different from the one neither of the Nehari type nor of the Pohozaev type, and then prove
the existence of ground states. Finally under some assumptions on $\omega$ and $p$, we prove that
the ground state standing waves are strongly unstable.
