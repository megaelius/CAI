We consider the full symmetric version of the Lax operator of the Toda lattice which is known as the
full symmetric Toda lattice. The phase space of this system is the generic orbit of the coadjoint
action of the Borel subgroup B^+(n) of SL(n,R). This system is integrable. We propose a new method
of constructing semi-invariants and integrals of the full symmetric Toda lattice. Using only the
Toda equations for the Lax eigenvector matrix we prove the existence of the semi-invariants which
are Plucker coordinates in the corresponding projective spaces. Then we use these semi-invariants
to construct the integrals. It is known that the full symmetric sl(n) Toda lattice has additional
integrals which can be produced by Kostant procedure except for the integrals which can be derived
by the chopping procedure. Altogether these integrals constitute a full set of the independent
non-involutive integrals. Yet the unsolved complicated technical problem is their explicit derivation
since Kostant procedure has crucial computational complexities even for low-rank Lax matrices
and is practically unapplicable for higher ranks. Our new approach provides a resolution of this
problem and results in simple explicit formulae for the full set of independent semi-invariants
and integrals expressed both in terms of the Lax matrix and its eigenvector and eigenvalue matrices
of the full symmetric sl(n) Toda lattice without using the chopping and Kostant procedures. We also
describe the structure of the additional integrals of motion as functions on the flag space modulo
the Toda flows and show how Plucker coordinates of different projective spaces define different
families of the additional integrals. In this paper we present detailed proofs of the propositions
of [24].
