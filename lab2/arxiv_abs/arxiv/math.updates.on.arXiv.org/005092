Centralized coded caching and delivery is studied for a radio access combination network (RACN),
whereby a set of $H$ edge nodes (ENs), connected to a cloud server via orthogonal fronthaul links
with limited capacity, serve a total of $K$ user equipments (UEs) over wireless links. Each user,
equipped with a cache of size $\mu_R N F$ bits, is connected to a distinct set of $r$ ENs each of which
equipped with a cache of size $\mu_T N F$ bits, where $\mu_T$, $\mu_R \in [0,1]$ are the fractional
cache capacities of the UEs and the ENs, respectively. The objective is to minimize the normalized
delivery time (NDT. Three coded caching and transmission schemes are considered, namely the\textit{
MDS-IA}, \textit{soft-transfer} and \textit{ zero-forcing (ZF)} schemes. The achievable NDT
for MDS-IA scheme is presented for $r=2$ and arbitrary fractional cache sizes $\mu_T$ and $\mu_R$,
and also for arbitrary value of $r$ and fractional cache size $\mu_T$ when the cache capacity of the
UE is above a certain threshold. The achievable NDT for the soft-transfer scheme is presented for
arbitrary $r$ and arbitrary fractional cache sizes $\mu_T$ and $\mu_R$. The last scheme utilizes
ZF between the ENs and the UEs without the participation of the cloud server in the delivery phase.
The achievable NDT for this scheme is presented for an arbitrary value of $r$ when the total cache
size at a pair of UE and EN is sufficient to store the whole library, i.e., $\mu_T+\mu_R \geq 1$. The
results indicate that the fronthaul capacity determines which scheme achieves a better performance
in terms of the NDT, and the soft-transfer scheme becomes favorable as the fronthaul capacity increases.
