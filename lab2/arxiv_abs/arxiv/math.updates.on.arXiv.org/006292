Power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology to exploit
the new dimension of the power domain to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. However,
most existing NOMA schemes rely on the strong assumption that users' channel gains are quite different,
which may be invalid in practice. To unleash the potential of power-domain NOMA, we will propose
a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered NOMA network to introduce desirable channel
gain differences among the users by adjusting the phase shifts at RIS. Our goal is to minimize the
total transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors at the base station and the phase-shift
matrix at the RIS. To address the highly coupled optimization variables, we present an alternating
optimization framework to decompose the non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic
problem into two rank-one constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. At the
same time, to accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one constraints and improve
performance by avoiding early stopping in the alternating optimization procedure, we equivalently
represent the rank-one constraint as the difference between nuclear norm and spectral norm. A difference-of-convex
(DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC programs via successive convex relaxation,
followed by establishing the convergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method.
We further propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions, considering
both the channel conditions and users' target data rates. Simulation results will validate the
effectiveness of deploying an RIS and the superiority of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization
method in reducing the total transmit power.
