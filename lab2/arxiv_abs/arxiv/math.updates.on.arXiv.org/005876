We consider the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation $-f''+q_\alpha f = Ef$ on the positive
half-axis with the potential $q_\alpha(r)=(\alpha-1/4)r^{-2}$. It is known that the value $\alpha=0$
plays a special role in this problem: all self-adjoint realizations of the formal differential
expression $-\partial^2_r + q_\alpha(r)$ for the Hamiltonian have infinitely many eigenvalues
for $\alpha<0$ and at most one eigenvalue for $\alpha\geq 0$. For each complex number $\vartheta$,
we construct a solution $\mathcal U^\alpha_\vartheta(E)$ of this equation that is entire analytic
in $\alpha$ and, in particular, is not singular at $\alpha = 0$. For $\alpha<1$ and real $\vartheta$,
the solutions $\mathcal U^\alpha_\vartheta(E)$ determine a unitary eigenfunction expansion
operator $U_{\alpha,\vartheta}\colon L_2(0,\infty)\to L_2(\mathbb R,\mathcal V_{\alpha,\vartheta})$,
where $\mathcal V_{\alpha,\vartheta}$ is a positive measure on $\mathbb R$. We show that each operator
$U_{\alpha,\vartheta}$ diagonalizes a certain self-adjoint realization $h_{\alpha,\vartheta}$
of the expression $-\partial^2_r + q_\alpha(r)$ and, moreover, that every such realization is
equal to $h_{\alpha,\vartheta}$ for some $\vartheta\in\mathbb R$. Employing suitable singular
Titchmarsh--Weyl $m$-functions, we explicitly find the spectral measures $\mathcal V_{\kappa,\vartheta}$
and prove their smooth dependence on $\alpha$ and $\vartheta$. Using the formulas for the spectral
measures, we analyse in detail how the transition through the point $\alpha=0$ occurs for both the
eigenvalues and the continuous spectrum of $h_{\alpha,\vartheta}$.
