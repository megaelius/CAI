The Symmetric Primal-Dual Simplex Pivot Decision Strategy (spdspds) is a novel iterative algorithm
to solve linear programming (LP) problems. Here, a simplex pivoting operation is considered simply
as an exchange between a basic (dependent) variable and a non-basic (independent) variable, in
the Tucker's Compact Symmetric Tableau (CST) which is a unique symmetric representation common
to both the primal as well as the dual of a linear programming problem in its standard canonical form.
From this viewpoint, the classical simplex pivoting operation of Dantzig may be considered as a
restricted special case. The proposed spdspds allows for a wider selection of simplex pivot elements,
spanning the choice among the entire set of all nonzero elements of the coefficient matrix in the
tableau. An infeasibility index associated with an LP is defined as the sum of the number of primal
variables and the number of dual variables that are infeasible. A measure of goodness as a global
effectiveness measure of a pivot selection is defined/determined as/by the decrease in the infeasibility
index associated with such a pivot selection. At each iteration, the selection of the simplex pivot
element itself is governed by the anticipated decrease in the infeasibility index - seeking the
best possible decrease in the infeasibility index at every iteration. Significant enhancement
in computational efficiency can be achieved by the utilization of the proposed concept of binding
constraints. When further reduction in the infeasibility index is not possible, then the tableau
is checked for the terminal tableau type to facilitate the problem classification.
