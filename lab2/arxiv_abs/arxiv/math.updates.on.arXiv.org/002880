The study of finite subgroups of a simple algebraic group $G$ reduces in a sense to those which are
almost simple. If an almost simple subgroup of $G$ has a socle which is not isomorphic to a group of
Lie type in the underlying characteristic of $G$, then the subgroup is called non-generic. This
paper considers non-generic subgroups of simple algebraic groups of exceptional type in arbitrary
characteristic. A finite subgroup is called Lie primitive if it lies in no proper subgroup of positive
dimension. We prove here that many non-generic subgroup types, including the alternating and symmetric
groups $\text{Alt}_{n}$, $\text{Sym}_{n}$ for $n \ge 10$, do not occur as Lie primitive subgroups
of an exceptional algebraic group. A subgroup of $G$ is called $G$-completely reducible if, whenever
it lies in a parabolic subgroup of $G$, it lies in a conjugate of the corresponding Levi factor. Here,
we derive a fairly short list of possible isomorphism types of non-$G$-completely reducible, non-generic
simple subgroups. As an intermediate result, for each simply connected $G$ of exceptional type,
and each non-generic finite simple group $H$ which embeds into $G/Z(G)$, we derive a set of feasible
characters, which restrict the possible composition factors of $V \downarrow S$, whenever $S$
is a subgroup of $G$ with image $H$ in $G/Z(G)$, and $V$ is either the Lie algebra of $G$ or a non-trivial
Weyl module for $G$ of least dimension. This has implications for the subgroup structure of the finite
groups of exceptional Lie type. For instance, we show that for $n \ge 10$, $\text{Alt}_n$ and $\text{Sym}_n$,
as well as numerous other almost simple groups, cannot occur as a maximal subgroup of an almost simple
group whose socle is a finite simple group of exceptional Lie type.
