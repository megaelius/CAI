In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms of age-of-information
(AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for real-time applications to transmit status
update messages to a remote controller. For some applications, computational expensive and time
consuming data processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be displayed. Mobile
edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources and they are placed close to users.
Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a promising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive
messages. In this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and consider
three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC server, and partial computing,
i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed locally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server.
Zero-wait policy is adopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message
is generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While in remote computing
and partial computing, a new message is generated once the previous one is received by the remote
MEC server. With infinite queue size and exponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form
average AoI for exponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing schemes.
For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed numerically. Simulation results
show that by carefully partitioning the computing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is
the smallest compared to local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically
the conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared with local computing.
