We will study a mathematical model of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the presence
of combination therapy that includes within-host infectious dynamics. The deterministic model
requires us to analyze asymptotic stability of two distinct steady states, disease-free and endemic
equilibria. Previous results have focused on investigating the global asymptotic stability of
the trivial steady state using an implicit finite-difference method which generates a system of
difference equations. We, instead, provide analytic solutions and long term attractive behavior
for the endemic steady state using the theory of difference equations. The dynamics of estimated
model is appropriately determined by a certain quantity threshold maintaining the immune response
to a sufficient level. The result also indicates that a forward bifurcation in the model happens
when the disease-free equilibrium loses its stability and a stable endemic equilibrium appears
as the basic reproduction number exceeds unity. In this scenario, the classical requirement of
the reproduction number being less than unity becomes a necessary and sufficient condition for
disease mitigation. When the associated reproduction number is in excess of unity, a stable endemic
equilibrium emerges with an unstable disease-free equilibrium (leading to the persistence and
existence of HIV within the infected individuals). The attractivity of the model reveals that the
disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under certain assumptions. A comparison
between the continuous and estimated discrete models is also provided to have a clear perception
in understanding the behavioral dynamics of disease modelling. Finally, we show that the associated
estimation method is very robust in the sense of numerical stability since the equilibria and the
stability conditions are independent of the time step.
