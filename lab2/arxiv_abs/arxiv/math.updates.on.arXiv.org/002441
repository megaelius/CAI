We define simplicial and dimension $\Gamma$-groups, the generalizations of simplicial and dimension
groups to the case when these groups have an action of an arbitrary group $\Gamma.$ We generalize
classic results which correspond to the case when $\Gamma$ is trivial. Assuming that $\Gamma$ is
such that its integral group ring is noetherian, we show that every dimension $\Gamma$-group is
isomorphic to a direct limit of a directed system of simplicial $\Gamma$-groups and that the limit
can be taken in the category of ordered groups with order-units or generating intervals. If $\Gamma$
is abelian and $R$ is a $\Gamma$-graded ring, the Grothendieck $\Gamma$-group $K_0^{\Gamma}(R)$
was defined by R. Hazrat. We adapt this definition for arbitrary $\Gamma.$ If $G$ is a pre-ordered
abelian group with an action of $\Gamma$ which agrees with the pre-ordered structure, we say that
$G$ is realized by a $\Gamma$-graded ring $R$ if $K_0^{\Gamma}(R)$ and $G$ are isomorphic as pre-ordered
$\Gamma$-groups with an isomorphism which preserves order-units or generating intervals. We
show that every simplicial $\Gamma$-group with an order-unit can be realized by a graded matricial
ring over a $\Gamma$-graded division ring. If $\Gamma$ is such that its integral group ring is noetherian,
every countable dimension $\Gamma$-group with an order-unit or a generating interval can be realized
by a $\Gamma$-graded ultramatricial ring over a $\Gamma$-graded division ring. We also relate
our results to graded rings with involution which give rise to Grothendieck $\Gamma$-groups with
actions of both $\Gamma$ and $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$. We adapt the Realization Problem for von Neumann
regular rings to graded rings and concepts from this work and discuss some other questions.
