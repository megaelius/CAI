We define generalized Feigin homomorphisms from a quantum shuffle algebra to quantum polynomial
algebras which extend the classical Feigin homomorphisms taking quantum groups to quantum polynomial
algebras. In a recent work of Berenstein and the author analogous extensions of Feigin homomorphisms
from the dual Hall-Ringel algebra of a valued quiver to quantum polynomial algebras were defined.
To relate these constructions we establish a homomorphism, dubbed the quantum shuffle character,
from the dual Hall-Ringel algebra to the quantum shuffle algebra which relates the generalized
Feigin homomorphisms. These constructions can be compactly described by a commuting tetrahedron
of maps beginning with the quantum group and terminating in a quantum polynomial algebra. Our second
goal in this project was to better understand the dual canonical basis conjecture for skew-symmetrizable
quantum cluster algebras. In the symmetrizable types it is known that dual canonical basis elements
need not have positive multiplicative structure constants, while this should hold for skew-symmetrizable
quantum cluster algebras. We propose an alternate conjecture for the symmetrizable types: the
cluster monomials should correspond to irreducible characters of KLR algebra. Indeed, the main
conjecture of this note would establish this "KLR conjecture" for acyclic skew-symmetrizable
quantum cluster algebras: that is, we conjecture that the images of rigid representations under
the quantum shuffle character give irreducible characters for KLR algebras. We sketch a proof in
the symmetric case giving an alternative to the proof of Kimura-Qin that all non-initial cluster
variables in an acyclic skew-symmetric quantum cluster algebra are contained in the dual canonical
basis. With these results in mind we interpret the cluster mutations directly in terms of the representation
theory of the KLR algebra.
