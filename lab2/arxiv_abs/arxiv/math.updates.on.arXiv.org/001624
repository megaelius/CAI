Let $\gamma\in(0,2)$ and let $h$ be the random distribution on $\mathbb C$ which describes a $\gamma$-Liouville
quantum gravity (LQG) cone. Also let $\kappa=16/\gamma^2>4$ and let $\eta$ be a whole-plane space-filling
SLE$_\kappa$ curve independent from $h$ and parametrized by $\gamma$-quantum mass with respect
to $h$. We study a family $\{\mathcal G^\epsilon\}_{\epsilon>0}$ of planar maps associated with
$(h,\eta)$ called the LQG structure graphs (a.k.a. mated-CRT maps) which we conjecture converge
in probability in the scaling limit with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a random metric
space associated with $\gamma$-LQG. In particular, $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ is the graph whose vertex
set is $\epsilon \mathbb Z$, with two such vertices $x_1,x_2\in\epsilon\mathbb Z$ connected by
an edge iff the curve segments $\eta([x_1-\epsilon,x_1])$ and $\eta([x_2-\epsilon,x_2])$ share
a non-trivial boundary arc. Due to the peanosphere description of SLE-decorated LQG due to Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield,
the graph $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ can be expressed as an explicit functional of a correlated 2d Brownian
motion, so can be studied without any reference to SLE or LQG. We prove non-trivial upper and lower
bounds for the cardinality of a graph-distance ball in $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ which are consistent
with the prediction of Watabiki for the dimension of LQG. Using subadditivity arguments, we also
prove that there is an exponent $\chi>0$ for which the expected graph distance between generic points
in the subgraph of $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ corresponding to the segment $\eta([0,1])$ is $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1)}$,
and this distance is extremely unlikely to be larger than $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1)}$. In the special
case when $\gamma=\sqrt 2$, we show that the diameter of this subgraph of $\mathcal G^\epsilon$
is of order $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1)}$ with high probability.
