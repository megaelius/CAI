An immersion of a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold $M \to \mathbb{R}^q$ is called totally nonparallel
if, for every distinct $x, y \in M$, the tangent spaces at $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ contain no parallel lines.
Given a manifold $M$, we seek the minimum dimension $TN(M)$ such that there exists a totally nonparallel
immersion $M \to \mathbb{R}^{TN(M)}$. In analogy with the totally skew embeddings studied by Ghomi
and Tabachnikov, we find that totally nonparallel immersions are related to the generalized vector
field problem, the immersion problem for real projective spaces, and nonsingular symmetric bilinear
maps. Our study of totally nonparallel immersions follows a recent trend of studying conditions
which manifest on the configuration space $F_k(M)$ of k-tuples of distinct points of $M$; for example,
k-regular embeddings, k-skew embeddings, k-neighborly embeddings, etc. Typically, a map satisfying
one of these configuration space conditions induces some $S_k$-equivariant map on the configuration
space $F_k(M)$ (or on a bundle thereof) and obstructions can be computed using Stiefel-Whitney
classes. However, the existence problem for such conditions is relatively unstudied. Our main
result is a Whitney-type theorem: every $n$-manifold $M$ admits a totally nonparallel immersion
into $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$, one dimension less than given by genericity. We begin by studying the
local problem, which requires a thorough understanding of the space of nonsingular symmetric bilinear
maps, after which the main theorem is established using the removal-of-singularities h-principle
technique due to Gromov and Eliashberg. When combined with a recent non-immersion theorem of Davis,
we obtain the exact value $TN(\mathbb{R}P^n) = 4n-1$ when $n$ is a power of 2. This is the first optimal-dimension
result for any closed manifold $M \neq S^1$, for any of the recently-studied configuration space
conditions.
