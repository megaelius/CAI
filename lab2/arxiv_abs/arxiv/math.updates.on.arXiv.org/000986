A centralized coded caching scheme has been proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen to reduce the worst-case
load of a network consisting of a server with access to N files and connected through a shared link
to K users, each equipped with a cache of size M. However, this centralized coded caching scheme is
not able to take advantage of a non-uniform, possibly very skewed, file popularity distribution.
In this work, we consider the same network setting but aim to reduce the average load under an arbitrary
(known) file popularity distribution. First, we consider a class of centralized coded caching
schemes utilizing general uncoded placement and a specific coded delivery strategy, which are
specified by a general file partition parameter. Then, we formulate the coded caching design optimization
problem over the considered class of schemes with 2^K2^N variables to minimize the average load
by optimizing the file partition parameter under an arbitrary file popularity. Furthermore, we
show that the optimization problem is convex, and the resulting optimal solution generally improves
upon known schemes. Next, we analyze structural properties of the optimization problem to obtain
design insights and reduce the complexity. Specifically, we obtain an equivalent linear optimization
problem with (K+1)N variables under an arbitrary file popularity and an equivalent linear optimization
problem with K+1 variables under the uniform file popularity. Under the uniform file popularity,
we also obtain the closed form optimal solution, which corresponds to Maddah-Ali-Niesen's centralized
coded caching scheme. Finally, we present an information-theoretic converse bound on the average
load under an arbitrary file popularity.
