We generalize earlier results about connected components of idempotents in Banach algebras, due
to B. Sz\H{o}kefalvi Nagy, Y. Kato, S. Maeda, Z. V. Kovarik, J. Zem\'anek, J. Esterle. Let $A$ be a
unital complex Banach algebra, and $p(\lambda) = \prod\limits_{i = 1}^n (\lambda - \lambda_i)$
a polynomial over $\Bbb C$, with all roots distinct. Let $E_p(A) := \{a \in A \mid p(a) = 0\}$. Then
all connected components of $E_p(A)$ are pathwise connected (locally pathwise connected) via
each of the following three types of paths: 1)~similarity via a finite product of exponential functions
(via an exponential function); 2)~a polynomial path (a cubic polynomial path); 3)~a polygonal
path (a polygonal path consisting of $n$ segments). If $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra, $\lambda_i \in \Bbb
R$, let $S_p(A):= \{a\in A \mid a = a^*$, $p(a) = 0\}$. Then all connected components of $S_p(A)$ are
pathwise connected (locally pathwise connected), via a path of the form $e^{-ic_mt}\dots e^{-ic_1t}
ae^{ic_1t}\dots e^{ic_mt}$, where $c_i = c_i^*$, and $t \in [0, 1]$ (of the form $e^{-ict} ae^{ict}$,
where $c = c^*$, and $t \in [0,1]$). For (self-adjoint) idempotents we have by these old papers that
the distance of different connected components of them is at least~$1$. For $E_p(A)$, $S_p(A)$
we pose the problem if the distance of different connected components is at least $\min \bigl\{|\lambda_i
- \lambda_j| \mid 1 \leq i,j \leq n, \ i \neq j\bigr\}$. For the case of $S_p(A)$, we give a positive
lower bound for these distances, that depends on $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$. We show that several
local and global lifting theorems for analytic families of idempotents, along analytic families
of surjective Banach algebra homomorphisms, from our recent paper with B. Aupetit and M. Mbekhta,
have analogues for elements of $E_p(A)$ and $S_p(A)$.
