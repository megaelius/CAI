The Heun function generalizes all well-known special functions such as Spheroidal Wave, Lame,
Mathieu, and hypergeometric functions. Heun functions are applicable to diverse areas such as
theory of black holes, lattice systems in statistical mechanics, solution of the Schrodinger equation
of quantum mechanics, and addition of three quantum spins. In this paper, applying three term recurrence
formula, I consider asymptotic behaviors of Heun function and its integral formalism including
all higher terms of A_n's. I will show how the power series expansion of Heun functions can be converted
to closed-form integrals for all cases of infinite series and polynomial. One interesting observation
resulting from the calculations is the fact that a Gauss hypergeometric function recurs in each
of sub-integral forms: the first sub-integral form contains zero term of A_n's, the second one contains
one term of A_n's, the third one contains two terms of A_n's, etc. In the appendix, I apply the power
series expansion and my integral formalism of Heun function to "The 192 solutions of the Heun equation."
Due to space restriction final equations for all 192 Heun functions is not included in the paper,
but feel free to contact me for the final solutions. Section 5 contains two additional examples using
integral forms of Huen function. This paper is 4th out of 10 in series "Special functions and three
term recurrence formula (3TRF)". See section 5 for all the papers in the series. The previous paper
in series deals with the power series expansion in closed forms of Heun function. The next paper in
the series describes analytically the power series expansion of Mathieu function and its integral
formalism.
