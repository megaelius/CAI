Ride-hailing platforms need to match supply and demand so as to maximize the rate of payoff generation
while respecting the geographical flow constraints, namely, that the rate at which vehicles arrive
at a location must equal the rate at which they leave that location. The platform's control levers
include: (i) entry control, i.e. it can choose not to serve some customers, (ii) dynamic pricing,
i.e. it can set prices for each ride depending on its origin and destination, and (iii) assignment
rule, i.e. it can choose from which neighboring location to dispatch a car for pickup. We consider
two settings depending on whether pricing is an available lever to the platform. In joint-entry-assignment
(JEA) setting, the platform can only use levers (i) and (iii) (for example, Didi in China does not
use dynamic pricing). In joint-pricing-assignment (JPA) setting, the platform can use levers
(ii) and (iii) (e.g. most ride-hailing platforms in North America). We introduce a novel family
of Mirror Backpressure (MBP) platform control policies which are simple, practical, and do not
require prior knowledge of the demand arrival rates. Key challenges include that serving a customer
reduces supply availability at the dispatch location but increases it at the dropoff location ("supply
externalities"), and that the number of vehicles at any location can never be negative (no-underflow
constraints"). Mirror Backpressure generalizes the backpressure policy such that it executes
mirror descent, allowing us to address these challenges. MBP loses at most an $O(K/T + 1/K)$ fraction
of the achievable payoff in the JEA setting and $O(\sqrt{K/T + 1/K})$ fraction in the JPA setting,
where $K$ is the number of vehicles and $T$ is the horizon. Simulation results in a realistic environment
support our theoretical findings.
