In this paper, we develop a simple and fast online algorithm for solving a general class of binary
integer linear programs (LPs). The algorithm requires only one single pass through the input data
and is free of doing any matrix inversion. It can be viewed as both an approximate algorithm for solving
binary integer LPs and a fast algorithm for solving online LP problems. The algorithm is inspired
by an equivalent form of the dual problem of the relaxed LP and it essentially performs projected
stochastic subgradient descent in the dual space. We analyze the algorithm in two different models,
the stochastic input model and the random permutation model, with minimal assumptions on the input
of the LP. The algorithm achieves $O\left(m \sqrt{n}\right)$ expected regret under the stochastic
input model and $O\left((m+\log n)\sqrt{n}\right)$ expected regret under the random permutation
model, and it achieves $O(m \sqrt{n})$ expected constraint violation under both models, where
$n$ is the number of decision variables and $m$ is the number of constraints. The algorithm enjoys
the same performance guarantee when generalized to a multi-dimensional LP setting which covers
a wider range of applications. To complete the discussion, we employ the notion of permutational
Rademacher complexity and analyze the regret of two online LP algorithms in the literature under
the random permutation model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to convert the possibly infeasible
solution to a feasible one through a randomized procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate the
general applicability and the performance of the algorithms.
