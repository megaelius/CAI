There are nowadays a huge load of publications about dengue epidemic models, which mostly employ
deterministic differential equations. The analytical properties of deterministic models are
always of particular interest by many experts, but their validity - if they can indeed track some
empirical data - is an increasing demand by many practitioners. In this view, the data can tell to
which figure the solutions yielded from the models should be; they drift all the involving parameters
towards the most appropriate values. By prior understanding of the population dynamics, some parameters
with inherently constant values can be estimated forthwith; some others can sensibly be guessed.
However, solutions from such models using sets of constant parameters most likely exhibit, if not
smoothness, at least noise-free behavior; whereas the data appear very random in nature. Therefore,
some parameters cannot be constant as the solutions to seemingly appear in a high correlation with
the data. We were aware of impracticality to solve a deterministic model many times that exhaust
all trials of the parameters, or to run its stochastic version with Monte Carlo strategy that also
appeals for a high number of solving processes. We were also aware that those aforementioned non-constant
parameters can potentially have particular relationships with several extrinsic factors, such
as meteorology and socioeconomics of the human population. We then study an estimation of time-space-varying
parameters within the framework of variational calculus and investigate how some parameters are
related to some extrinsic factors. Numerical results for some examples with real data are shown
and discussed in details.
