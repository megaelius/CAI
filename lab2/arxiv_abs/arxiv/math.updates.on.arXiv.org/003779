We examine regularity of the extremal solution of nonlinear nonlocal eigenvalue problems with
an integro-differential operator, including the fractional Laplacian, of the form of $$ \mathcal
L(u (x))= \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \int_{\mathbb R^n\setminus B_\epsilon(x) } [u(x) - u(z)] J(z-x)
dz , $$ when $J$ is a nonnegative measurable even jump kernel. We first establish stability inequalities
for minimal solutions of the above system for a general nonlinearity and a general kernel. In particular,
we study systems with exponential and power-type nonlinearities leading to the Gelfand system
and the Lane-Emden system, with both positive and negative exponents. We consider jump kernels
of the form of $J(y)=\frac{a(y/|y|)}{|y|^{n+2s}}$ where $s\in (0,1)$ and $a$ is any nonnegative
even measurable function in $L^1(\mathbb {S}^{n-1})$ that satisfies ellipticity assumptions.
Note that for the case of constant $a$ the above operator is called the fractional Laplacian operator
and it is associated with a local equation known as the Caffaralli-Silvestre extension problem.
However, in the general setting that is for all functions $a$, such an extension problem is not known.
We prove regularity of extremal solutions in dimensions $n < 10s$ and $ n<2s+\frac{4s}{p\mp 1}[p+\sqrt{p(p\mp1)}]$
for the Gelfand and Lane-Emden systems when $p>1$ (with positive and negative exponents), respectively.
We establish the regularity results via technical integral estimates, inspired originally by
Crandall-Rabinowitz, and we do not apply any local extension problem arguments. Moreover, we consider
gradient systems with general nonlinearities and we establish regularity of extremal solutions
in dimensions $n<4s$. As far as we know, this is the first regularity result on extremal solutions
of nonlocal systems.
