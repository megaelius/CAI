The article discusses the fractional powers of the Bessel operator and their numerical implementation.
An extensive literature is devoted to the study of fractional powers of the Laplace operator and
their applications. Such degrees are used in the construction of functional spaces, in the natural
generalization of the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum theory, in the construction of the models
of acoustic wave propagation in complex media (for example, biological tissues) and space-time
models of anomalous (very slow or very fast) diffusion, in spectral theory etc. If we assume the radiality
of the function on which the Laplace operator acts, then we receive the problem of constructing the
fractional power of the Bessel operator. We propose to use a compositional method for constructing
the operators mentioned earlier, which leads to constructions similar in their properties to the
Riesz derivatives. The Hankel transform is considered as a basic integral transformation. On its
basis, the compositional method proposed by V.V. Katrakhov and S.M. Sitnik, negative powers of
the Bessel operator are constructed. The resulting operator contains the Gaussian hypergeometric
function in the kernel. For further study, the generalized translation operator is considered
in the article, and its properties are proved. For constructing a positive fractional power of the
Bessel operator known methods of regularization of the integral are considered. Then, a scheme
for the numerical calculation of fractional powers of the Bessel operator is proposed. This scheme
is based on the Taylor--Delsarte formula obtained by B.M. Levitan.
