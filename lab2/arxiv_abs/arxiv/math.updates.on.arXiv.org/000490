We consider a finite region of a d-dimensional lattice of nonlinear Hamiltonian rotators, where
neighbouring rotators have opposite spins and are coupled by a small potential of order $\eps^a,\,
a\geq1/2$. We weakly stochastically perturb the system in such a way that each rotator interacts
with its own stochastic thermostat with a force of order $\eps$. Then we introduce action-angle
variables for the system of uncoupled rotators ($\eps=0$) and note that the sum of actions over all
nodes is conserved by the purely Hamiltonian dynamics of the system with $\eps>0$. We investigate
the limiting (as $\eps \ra 0$) dynamics of actions for solutions of the $\eps$-perturbed system
on time intervals of order $\eps^{-1}$. It turns out that the limiting dynamics is governed by a certain
stochastic equation for the vector of actions, which we call the transport equation. This equation
has a completely non-Hamiltonian nature. The $\eps$-perturbed system has a unique stationary
measure $\wid \mu^\eps$ and is mixing. Any limiting point of the family $\{\wid \mu^\eps\}$ of stationary
measures as $\eps\ra 0$ is an invariant measure of the system of uncoupled integrable rotators.
There are plenty of such measures. However, it turns out that only one of them describes the limiting
dynamics of the $\eps$-perturbed system: we prove that a limiting point of $\{\wid\mu^\eps\}$
is unique, its projection to the space of actions is the unique stationary measure of the transport
equation, which turns out to be mixing, and its projection to the space of angles is the normalized
Lebesque measure on the torus $\mT^N$. The convergence of actions as $\eps\ra 0$ is uniform in the
number $N$ of rotators, while the convergence of stationary measures is uniform in $N$ in some natural
case.
