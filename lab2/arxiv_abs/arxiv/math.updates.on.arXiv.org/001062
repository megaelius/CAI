In this paper, we speed up the solution of inverse problems in Bayesian settings. By computing the
likelihood, the most expensive part of the Bayesian formula, one compares the available measurement
data with the simulated data. To get simulated data, repeated solution of the forward problem is
required. This could be a great challenge. Often, the available measurement is a functional $F(u)$
of the solution $u$ or a small part of $u$. Typical examples of $F(u)$ are the solution in a point, solution
on a coarser grid, in a small subdomain, the mean value in a subdomain. It is a waste of computational
resources to evaluate, first, the whole solution and then compute a part of it. In this work, we compute
the functional $F(u)$ direct, without computing the full inverse operator and without computing
the whole solution $u$. The main ingredients of the developed approach are the hierarchical domain
decomposition technique, the finite element method and the Schur complements. To speed up computations
and to reduce the storage cost, we approximate the forward operator and the Schur complement in the
hierarchical matrix format. Applying the hierarchical matrix technique, we reduced the computing
cost to $\mathcal{O}(k^2n \log^2 n)$, where $k\ll n$ and $n$ is the number of degrees of freedom.
Up to the hierarchical matrix accuracy, the computation of the functional $F(u)$ is exact. To reduce
the computational resources further, we can approximate $F(u)$ on, for instance, multiple coarse
meshes. The offered method is well suited for solving multiscale problems. A disadvantage of this
method is the assumption that one has to have access to the discretisation and to the procedure of
assembling the Galerkin matrix.
