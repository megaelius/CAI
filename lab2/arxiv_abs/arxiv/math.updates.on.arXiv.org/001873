Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be monoidal categories and let $(L:\mathcal{B}\rightarrow
\mathcal{A},R:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{B})$ be a pair of adjoint functors. Supposing
that $R$ is moreover a lax monoidal functor (or, equivalently, that $L$ is colax monoidal), $R$ induces
a functor $\overline{R}:{ \sf Alg}({\mathcal{A}})\rightarrow {\sf Alg}({\mathcal{B}})$ and
$L$ colifts to a functor $\underline{L}:{\sf Coalg}({\mathcal{B}})\rightarrow {\sf Coalg}({\mathcal{A}})$,
as is well-known. An adjoint pair of such functors $(L,R)$ is called {\it liftable} if the functor
$\overline{R}$ has a left adjoint and if the functor $\underline{L}$ has a right adjoint. A pleasing
fact is that, when $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are moreover endowed with a braiding, a liftable
pair of functors as above gives rise to an adjunction $({\underline{\overline{L}}},{\underline{\overline{R}}})$
between the categories ${\sf Hopfalg}(\mathcal{A})$ and ${\sf Hopfalg}(\mathcal{B})$, provided
$R$ is braided with respect to the braidings of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$. In this note, sufficient
conditions on the category $\mathcal{A}$ for $\overline{R}$ to possess a left adjoint, are given.
Furthermore, it is shown that a so-called {\it pre-rigid} braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$
always allows for a liftable pair of adjoint functors $( (-)^{*}:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}^{\rm
op},(-)^{*}:\mathcal{C}^{\rm op}\rightarrow \mathcal{C})$ provided $\overline{(-)^{*}}$
has an adjoint. We apply our results taking $\mathcal{C}$ to be the category of vector spaces graded
by an abelian group $G$. The lifted adjunction mentioned above is explicitly described and provides
a $G$-graded version of Sweedler's classical finite dual construction.
