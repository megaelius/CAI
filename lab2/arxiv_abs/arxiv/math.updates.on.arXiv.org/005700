We consider the reduction of parametric families of linear dynamical systems having an affine parameter
dependence that differ from one another by a low-rank variation in the state matrix. Usual approaches
for parametric model reduction typically involve exploring the parameter space to isolate representative
models on which to focus model reduction methodology, which are then combined in various ways in
order to interpolate the response from these representative models. The initial exploration of
the parameter space can be a forbiddingly expensive task. A different approach is proposed here
that does not require any parameter sampling or exploration of the parameter space. Instead, we
represent the system response in terms of four subsystems that are nonparametric. One may apply
any one of a number of standard (nonparametric) model reduction strategies to reduce the subsystems
independently, and then conjoin these reduced models with the underlying parameterized representation
to obtain an overall parameterized response. Our approach has elements in common with the parameter
mapping approach of Baur et al. [8], but offers greater flexibility and potentially greater control
over accuracy. In particular, a data-driven variation of our approach is described that exercises
this flexibility through the use of limited frequency-sampling of the underlying nonparametric
models. The parametric structure of our system representation allows for a priori guarantees of
system stability the resulting parametric reduced models, uniformly across all parameter values.
Incorporation of system theoretic error bounds allow us to determine appropriate approximation
orders for the nonparametric systems sufficient to yield uniformly high accuracy with respect
to parameter variation.
