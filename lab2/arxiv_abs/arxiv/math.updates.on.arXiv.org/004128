Frequency-domain electromagnetic instruments allow, also because of their handy sizes, the collection
of data in different configuration, i.e. varying the inter-coil spacing, the frequency, and the
height above the ground. This makes these tools very practical for the characterization of the near
surface in many fields of applications (e.g., precision agriculture, pollution assessments,
shallow geological investigations). To this end, the inversion of either the in-phase or the quadrature
component of the signal has been already studied. Furthermore, in some occasion not enough attention
is paid to the a priori information available on the solution, and a smoothness condition is blindly
imposed to regularization techniques, regardless of the solution properties. The present work
discusses an algorithm for the inversion of the complex signal in its entirety, as well as a regularization
method promoting the sparsity of the reconstructed electrical conductivity distribution. This
regularization strategy incorporates a minimum gradient support stabilizer into a truncated
generalized singular value decomposition scheme. The results of the implementation of this sparse
regularization at each step of a damped Gauss-Newton inversion algorithm (based on a nonlinear
forward model) are compared against the associated solutions obtained via a, more standard, smooth
stabilizer. Moreover, we also study the depth of investigation (DOI) in order to provide an estimation
of the maximun depth that can be investigated. The effectiveness and limitations of the whole inversion
algorithm are demonstrated on synthetic datasets.
