In this paper, we deal with an obstacle placement problem inside a disk, that can be formulated as
an energy minimization problem with respect to rotations of the obstacle about its center and also
w.r.t the translations of the obstacle within the disk. Such problems find important applications
in the design of liquid crystal devices, musical instruments and optimal accelerator cavities.
We carry out the shape calculus analysis for the boundary value at hand and derive an expression for
the Eulerian derivative of the energy functional. Once we have this expression, the proof for finding
optimal configurartions w.r.t. the rotations of the obstacle about its fixed center follows more
or less from [1]. We also obtain results characterizing global maximizers/minimisers configuration
of the obstacle inside the disk, w.r.t. both rotations and translations of the obstacle within the
disk. We show that the extremal configurations correspond to the cases, where an axis of symmetry
of the obstacle coincide with an axis of symmetry of the disk. We completely characterize the maximizing
and minimizing configurations for the case, when the obstacle has a dihedral symmetry of even order.
For the case of odd order symmetry, we have partial results. We face exactly the same difficulties
as in [1] in characterizing the optimal configurations for the odd order case completely. Finally,
various numerical observations validate the theoretical results obtained as well as the conjectures
stated. [1] Anisa M. H. Chorwadwala and Souvik Roy: How to Place an Obstacle Having a Dihedral Symmetry
