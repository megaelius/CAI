The goal of this article is to contribute towards the conceptual and quantitative understanding
of the evolutionary benefits for (microbial) populations to maintain a seed bank (consisting of
dormant individuals) when facing fluctuating environmental conditions. To this end, we compare
the long term behaviour of `1-type' Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson branching processes (describing
populations consisting of `active' individuals only) with that of a class of `2-type' branching
processes, describing populations consisting of `active' and `dormant' individuals. All processes
are embedded in an environment changing randomly between `harsh' and `healthy' conditions, affecting
the reproductive behaviour of the populations accordingly. For the 2-type branching processes,
we consider several different switching regimes between active and dormant states. We also impose
overall resource limitations which incorporate the potentially different `production costs'
of active and dormant offspring, leading to the notion of `fair comparison' between different populations,
and allow for a reproductive trade-off due to the maintenance of the dormancy trait. Our switching
regimes include the case where switches from active to dormant states and vice versa happen randomly,
irrespective of the state of the environment (`spontaneous switching'), but also the case where
switches are triggered by the environment (`responsive switching'), as well as combined strategies.
It turns out that there are rather natural scenarios under which either switching strategy can be
super-critical, while the others, as well as complete absence of a seed bank, are strictly sub-critical,
even under `fair comparison' wrt. available resources. In such a case, we see a clear selective advantage
of the super-critical strategy, which is retained even under the presence of a (potentially small)
reproductive trade-off. [...]
