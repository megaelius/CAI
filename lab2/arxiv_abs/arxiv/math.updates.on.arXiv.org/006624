We introduce a new class of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with seed bank modeling
the spread of a beneficial allele in a spatial population where individuals may switch between an
active and a dormant state. Incorporating dormancy and the resulting seed bank leads to a two-type
coupled system of equations with migration between both states. We first discuss existence and
uniqueness of seed bank SPDEs and provide an equivalent delay representation that allows a clear
interpretation of the age structure in the seed bank component. The delay representation will also
be crucial in the proofs. Further, we show that the seed bank SPDEs give rise to an interesting class
of "on/off" moment duals. In particular, in the special case of the F-KPP Equation with seed bank,
the moment dual is given by an "on/off-branching Brownian motion". This system differs from a classical
branching Brownian motion in the sense that independently for all individuals, motion and branching
may be "switched off" for an exponential amount of time after which they get "switched on" again.
Here, as an application of our duality, we show that the spread of a beneficial allele, which in the
classical F-KPP Equation, started from a Heaviside intial condition, evolves as a pulled traveling
wave with speed $\sqrt{2}$, is slowed down significantly in the corresponding seed bank F-KPP model.
In fact, by computing bounds on the position of the rightmost particle in the dual on/off-branching
Brownian motion, we obtain an upper bound for the speed of propagation of the beneficial allele given
by $\sqrt{\sqrt{5}-1}\approx 1.111$ under unit switching rates. This shows that seed banks will
indeed slow down fitness waves and preserve genetic variability, in line with intuitive reasoning
from population genetics and ecology.
