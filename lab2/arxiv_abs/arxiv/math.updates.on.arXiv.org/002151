We establish pointwise and distributional fractal tube formulas for a large class of relative fractal
drums in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimensions. A relative fractal drum (or RFD, in short) is
an ordered pair $(A,\Omega)$ of subsets of the Euclidean space (under some mild assumptions) which
generalizes the notion of a (compact) subset and that of a fractal string. By a fractal tube formula
for an RFD $(A,\Omega)$, we mean an explicit expression for the volume of the $t$-neighborhood of
$A$ intersected by $\Omega$ as a sum of residues of a suitable meromorphic function (here, a fractal
zeta function) over the complex dimensions of the RFD $(A,\Omega)$. The complex dimensions of an
RFD are defined as the poles of its meromorphically continued fractal zeta function (namely, the
distance or the tube zeta function), which generalizes the well-known geometric zeta function
for fractal strings. These fractal tube formulas generalize in a significant way to higher dimensions
the corresponding ones previously obtained for fractal strings by the first author and van Frankenhuijsen
and later on, by the first author, Pearse and Winter in the case of fractal sprays. They are illustrated
by several interesting examples. These examples include fractal strings, the Sierpi\'nski gasket
and the 3-dimensional carpet, fractal nests and geometric chirps, as well as self-similar fractal
sprays. We also propose a new definition of fractality according to which a bounded set (or RFD) is
considered to be fractal if it possesses at least one nonreal complex dimension or if its fractal
zeta function possesses a natural boundary. This definition, which extends to RFDs and arbitrary
bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N$ the previous one introduced in the context of fractal strings,
is illustrated by the Cantor graph (or devil's staircase) RFD, which is shown to be `subcritically
fractal'.
