This paper considers coordinated multicast beamforming in a multi-cell multigroup multiple-input
single-output system. Each base station (BS) serves multiple groups of users by forming a single
beam with common information per group. We propose centralized and distributed beamforming algorithms
for two different optimization targets. The first objective is to minimize the total transmission
power of all the BSs while guaranteeing the user-specific minimum quality-of-service targets.
The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method is used to approximate the non-convex multicast problem
as a semidefinite program (SDP), which is solvable via centralized processing. Subsequently,
two alternative distributed methods are proposed. The first approach turns the SDP into a two-level
optimization via primal decomposition. At the higher level, inter-cell interference powers are
optimized for fixed beamformers while the lower level locally optimizes the beamformers by minimizing
BS-specific transmit powers for the given inter-cell interference constraints. The second distributed
solution is enabled via an alternating direction method of multipliers, where the inter-cell interference
optimization is divided into a local and a global optimization by forcing the equality via consistency
constraints. We further propose a centralized and a simple distributed beamforming design for
the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem in which the minimum SINR
among the users is maximized with given per-BS power constraints. This problem is solved via the
bisection method as a series of SDP feasibility problems. The simulation results show the superiority
of the proposed coordinated beamforming algorithms over traditional non-coordinated transmission
schemes, and illustrate the fast convergence of the distributed methods.
