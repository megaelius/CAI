Strong stability preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta methods are desirable when evolving in time problems
that have discontinuities or sharp gradients and require nonlinear non-inner-product stability
properties to be satisfied. Unlike the case for L2 linear stability, implicit methods do not significantly
alleviate the time-step restriction when the SSP property is needed. For this reason, when handling
problems with a linear component that is stiff and a nonlinear component that is not, SSP integrating
factor Runge--Kutta methods may offer an attractive alternative to traditional time-stepping
methods. The strong stability properties of integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods where the
transformed problem is evolved with an explicit SSP Runge--Kutta method with non-decreasing abscissas
was recently established. In this work, we consider the use of downwinded spatial operators to preserve
the strong stability properties of integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods where the Runge--Kutta
method has some decreasing abscissas. We present the SSP theory for this approach and present numerical
evidence to show that such an approach is feasible and performs as expected. However, we also show
that in some cases the integrating factor approach with explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods with
non-decreasing abscissas performs nearly as well, if not better, than with explicit SSP Runge--Kutta
methods with downwinding. In conclusion, while the downwinding approach can be rigorously shown
to guarantee the SSP property for a larger time-step, in practice using the integrating factor approach
by including downwinding as needed with optimal explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods does not necessarily
provide significant benefit over using explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods with non-decreasing
abscissas.
