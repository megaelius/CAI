In this paper, we conceive an advanced neutral host micro operator (NH-{\mu}O) network approach
providing venues with services tailored to their specialized/specific requirements and/or local
context related services that the mobile network operators (MNOs) are poorly-suited to providing
it, as well as mobile broadband experience to the users from MNOs in a venue where only a single infrastructure
is mandated under shared spectrum access framework. A radio access network slicing concept is conceived
to support and optimize both the slice instance (SI) use cases independently and efficiently by
running all network implementations in parallel, simultaneously on a common physical network
infrastructure. We devise a common shared architecture for the NH-{\mu}O small cell base stations
and dynamic spectrum assignment control unit, and their required functionalities supporting
coexistence of different SIs as well as multiple MNOs in shared spectrum access communications.
We devise both inter-SI and intra- SI dynamic spectrum allocation policies considering time-varying
requirements of different SIs. The policies are capable of taking care of application level priority,
-i.e., mixture of guaranteed quality of service and best-effort service users served by each SI
while ensuring a healthy competition. Our proposed framework serves two-fold advantages, such
as it gives the venue owner its own managed wireless networks tailored to its very specific requirements,
and it also brings out cost savings and coverage extension for MNOs and efficiency of resources that
arise from sharing wireless networks, and delivering the network capacity into high density venues.
