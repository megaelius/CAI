This paper investigates a hybrid stochastic differential reinsurance and investment game between
one reinsurer and two insurers, including a stochastic Stackelberg differential subgame and a
non-zero-sum stochastic differential subgame. The reinsurer, as the leader of the Stackelberg
game, can price reinsurance premium and invest its wealth in a financial market that contains a risk-free
asset and a risky asset. The two insurers, as the followers of the Stackelberg game, can purchase
proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer and invest in the same financial market. The competitive
relationship between two insurers is modeled by the non-zero-sum game, and their decision making
will consider the relative performance measured by the difference in their terminal wealth. We
consider wealth processes with delay to characterize the bounded memory feature. This paper aims
to find the equilibrium strategy for the reinsurer and insurers by maximizing the expected utility
of the reinsurer's terminal wealth with delay and maximizing the expected utility of the combination
of insurers' terminal wealth and the relative performance with delay. By using the idea of backward
induction and the dynamic programming approach, we derive the equilibrium strategy and value functions
explicitly. Then, we provide the corresponding verification theorem. Finally, some numerical
examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the effects of model parameters
on the equilibrium strategy. We find the delay factor discourages or stimulates investment depending
on the length of delay. Moreover, competitive factors between two insurers make their optimal reinsurance-investment
strategy interact, and reduce reinsurance demand and reinsurance premium price.
