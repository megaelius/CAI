The purpose of this paper is to study holomorphic approximation and approximation of $\partial$-closed
forms in complex manifolds of complex dimension n $\ge$ 1. We consider extensions of the classical
Runge theorem and the Mergelyan property to domains in complex manifolds for the C $\infty$-smooth
and the L 2 topology. We characterize the Runge or Mergelyan property in terms of certain Dolbeault
cohomology groups and some geometric sufficient conditions are given. Holomorphic approximation
is a fundamental subject in complex analysis. The Runge theorem asserts that, if K is a compact subset
of an open Riemann surface X such that X \ K has no relatively compact connected components, then every
holomorphic function on a neighborhood of K can be approximated uniformly on K by holomorphic functions
on X. If K is a compact subset of an open Riemann surface X, we denote by A(K) the space of continuous
functions on K, which are holomorphic in the interior of K. Then Mergelyan theorem asserts that,
if K is such that X \ K has no relatively compact connected components , then every function in A(K)
can be approximated uniformly on K by holomorphic functions on X. Holomorphic approximation in
one complex variable has been studied and well understood , while the analogous problems in several
variables are much less understood with many open questions. An up-to-date account of the history
and recent development of holomorphic approximation in one and several variables can be found in
the paper by J.E. Fornaess, F. Forstneric and E.F. Wold [4]. In this paper we will consider holomorphic
approximation in complex manifolds of higher complex dimension and also approximation of $\partial$-closed
forms for different topologies like the uniform or the smooth topology on compact subsets or the
L 2 topology. The aim is to characterize different types of holomorphic or $\partial$-closed approximation
in a subdomain of a complex manifold using properties of the Dolbeault cohomology with compact or
prescribed support in the domain or using properties of the Dolbeault cohomology of the complement
of the domain with respect to some family of support. If M is a complex manifold, we denote by H p,q c
(M) the Dolbeault cohomology group with compact support of bidegree (p, q) in M. Let D $\subset$$\subset$
X be relatively compact domain in a complex manifold X, for any neighborhood V of X \ D the family $\Phi$
of supports in V consists of all closed subsets F of V such that F $\cup$ D is a compact subset of X. For
0 $\le$ p, q $\le$ n, H p,q $\Phi$ (X \ D) = 0 means that for any neighborhood V of X \ D and for any 2010 Mathematics
