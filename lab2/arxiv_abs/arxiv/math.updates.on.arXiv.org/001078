We study the general problem of testing whether an unknown distribution belongs to a specified family
of distributions. More specifically, given a distribution family $\mathcal{P}$ and sample access
to an unknown discrete distribution $\mathbf{P}$, we want to distinguish (with high probability)
between the case that $\mathbf{P} \in \mathcal{P}$ and the case that $\mathbf{P}$ is $\epsilon$-far,
in total variation distance, from every distribution in $\mathcal{P}$. This is the prototypical
hypothesis testing problem that has received significant attention in statistics and, more recently,
in theoretical computer science. The sample complexity of this general inference task depends
on the underlying family $\mathcal{P}$. The gold standard in distribution property testing is
to design sample-optimal and computationally efficient algorithms for this task. The main contribution
of this work is a simple and general testing technique that is applicable to all distribution families
whose Fourier spectrum satisfies a certain approximate sparsity property. To the best of our knowledge,
ours is the first use of the Fourier transform in the context of distribution testing. We apply our
Fourier-based framework to obtain near sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers
for the following fundamental distribution families: Sums of Independent Integer Random Variables
(SIIRVs), Poisson Multinomial Distributions (PMDs), and Discrete Log-Concave Distributions.
For the first two, ours are the first non-trivial testers in the literature, vastly generalizing
previous work on testing Poisson Binomial Distributions. For the third, our tester improves on
prior work in both sample and time complexity.
