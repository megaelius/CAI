We study the classical Rajeev-Ranken model, a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom
describing nonlinear continuous waves in a 1+1-dimensional nilpotent scalar field theory pseudodual
to the SU(2) principal chiral model. While it loosely resembles the Neumann and Kirchhoff models,
its equations may be viewed as the Euler equations for a centrally extended Euclidean algebra. The
model has a Lax pair and r-matrix leading to four generically independent conserved quantities
in involution, two of which are Casimirs. Their level sets define four-dimensional symplectic
leaves on which the system is Liouville integrable. On each of these leaves, the common level sets
of the remaining conserved quantities are shown, in general, to be 2-tori. The non-generic level
sets can only be horn tori, circles and points. They correspond to measure zero subsets where the
conserved quantities develop relations and solutions degenerate from elliptic to hyperbolic,
circular or constant functions. A geometric construction allows us to realize each common level
set as a bundle with base determined by the roots of a cubic polynomial. A dynamics is defined on the
union of each type of level set, with the corresponding phase manifolds expressed as bundles over
spaces of conserved quantities. Interestingly, topological transitions in energy hypersurfaces
are found to occur at energies corresponding to horn tori, which support purely homoclinic orbits.
The dynamics on each horn torus is non-Hamiltonian, but expressed as a gradient flow. Finally, we
discover a family of action-angle variables for the system that apply away from horn tori.
