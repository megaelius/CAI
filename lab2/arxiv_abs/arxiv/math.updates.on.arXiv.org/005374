Here we prove a global existence theorem for sufficiently small however fully nonlinear perturbations
of a family of background solutions of $`n+1$' vacuum Einstein equations in the presence of a positive
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The future stability of vacuum solutions in the small data and
zero cosmological constant limit has been studied previously for both $`3+1$' and higher dimensional
spacetimes. However, with the advent of dark energy driven accelerated expansion of the universe,
it is of fundamental importance in mathematical cosmology to include a positive cosmological constant,
the simplest form of the dark energy in the vacuum Einstein equations. Such Einsteinian evolution
is entitled as the `Einstein-$\Lambda$' flow. We study the background solutions of this `Einstein-$\Lambda$'
flow in $`n+1$' dimensional spacetimes in constant mean curvature spatial harmonic gauge, $n\geq3$
and establish both linear and non-linear stability of such solutions. We implement shadow gauge
condition \cite{andersson2011einstein} to handle the non-trivial Einstein moduli spaces in
$n>3$ spatial dimensional case, where the background solution is allowed to vary with time. Such
time dependence of the suitably re-scaled background spatial metric introduces modifications
to the elliptic equations obtained through imposing gauge conditions. We construct a suitable
Lyapunov function for the non-linear non-autonomous evolution of the small data and prove its decay
in the direction of cosmological expansion. Our results demonstrate the future stability and geodesic
completeness of the perturbed spacetimes, and show that the scale-free geometry converges to an
element of the Einstein moduli space (a point for $n=3$ and a finite dimensional space for $n>3$),
which has significant consequence on the cosmic topology while restricting to the case of $n=3$.
