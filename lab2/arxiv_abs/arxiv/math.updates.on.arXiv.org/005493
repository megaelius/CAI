The circumcentered Douglas--Rachford method (C--DRM) introduced by Behling, Bello Cruz and Santos
iterates by taking the circumcenter of associated successive reflections. It is an acceleration
of the well-known Douglas-Rachford method for solving the best approximation problem onto the
intersection of finitely many affine subspaces. Inspired by the C--DRM, we introduced the more
flexible circumcentered reflection method (CRM) and circumcentered isometry method (CIM). The
circumcentered--reflection method introduced by Behling, Bello Cruz and Santos to generalize
the C--DRM is a special class of our CRM. We consider the CIM induced by a set of finitely many isometries
for finding the best approximation onto the intersection of fixed point sets of the isometries which
turns out to be an intersection of finitely many affine subspaces. We prove the linear convergence
of CIMs in finite-dimensional spaces, which is a generalization of the known linear convergence
results on CRMs in finite-dimensional spaces. In order to better accelerate the symmetric method
of alternating projections (MAP), the accelerated symmetric MAP first applies another operator
to the initial point. (Similarly, to accelerate the DRM, the C--DRM first applies another operator
to the initial point as well.) Motivated by these facts, we show results on the linear convergence
of CIMs in Hilbert spaces with first applying another operator to the initial point. In particular,
under some restrictions, our results imply that some CRMs attain the known linear convergence rate
of the accelerated symmetric MAP in Hilbert spaces. We also exhibit a class of CRMs converging to
the best approximation in Hilbert spaces with a convergence rate no worse than the sharp convergence
rate of MAP. The fact that some CRMs attain the linear convergence rate of MAP or accelerated symmetric
MAP is entirely new.
