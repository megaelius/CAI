Recently Markovian Loop measures have become an active field in probability (LeJan,Sznitman)
with its origin going back to Symanzik [Sym69] and Brydges et al. [BFS82]. In this work we are going
to investigate a novel setting of these loop measures, namely we consider first loop soups with varying
intensity $ \mu\le 0 $ (chemical potential in physics terms). Secondly, we study Markovian loop
measures on graphs with an additional time dimension leading to so-called space-time random walks
and their loop measures and Poisson point loop processes. Interesting phenomena appear when the
additional coordinate of the space-time process is on a discrete torus with non-symmetric jumping
rates. The projection of these space-time random walk loop measures onto the space dimensions are
loop measures on the spatial graph, and in the scaling limit of the discrete torus these loop measures
converge to the so-called Bosonic loop measures. These novel loop measures have similarities with
the standard Markovian loop measures. The Bosonic loop measures not only have the probabilistic
motivation as outlined, a second major interest in these objects stems from the fact the the total
weights of the Bosonic loop measure for a finite graph is exactly the logarithm of the grand-canonical
partition function of non-interacting Bose gases in thermodynamic equilibrium at inverse temperature
$ \beta>0 $ and chemical potential $ \mu\le 0 $. We complement our study with generalised versions
of Dynkin's isomorphim theorem as well as Symanzik's moment formulae for complex Gaussian measures.
Due to the lacking symmetry of our space-time random walks, the distributions of the occupation
time fields is given in terms of a complex Gaussian measures over complex-valued random fields [B92,BIS09].
