In his seminal work from the 1950s, William Feller classified all one-dimensional diffusions on
$-\infty\leq a<b\leq \infty$ in terms of their ability to access the boundary (Feller's test for
explosions) and to enter the interior from the boundary. Feller's technique is restricted to diffusion
processes as the corresponding differential generators allow explicit computations and the use
of Hille-Yosida theory. In the present article we study exit and entrance from infinity for the most
natural generalization, that is, jump diffusions of the form \[ dZ_t=\sigma(Z_{t-})\,dX_t, \]
driven by stable L\'evy processes for $\alpha\in (0,2)$. Many results have been proved for jump
diffusions, employing a variety of techniques developed after Feller's work but exit and entrance
from infinite boundaries has long remained open. We show that the presence of jumps implies features
not seen in the diffusive setting without drift. Finite time explosion is possible for $\alpha\in
(0,1)$, whereas entrance from different kinds of infinity is possible for $\alpha\in [1,2)$. We
derive necessary and sufficient conditions on $\sigma$ so that (i) non-exploding solutions exist
and (ii) the corresponding transition semigroup extends to an entrance point at `infinity'. Our
proofs are based on very recent developments for path transformations of stable processes via the
Lamperti-Kiu representation and new Wiener-Hopf factorisations for L\'evy processes that lie
therein. The arguments draw together original and intricate applications of results using the
Riesz-Bogdan--\.Zak transformation, entrance laws for self-similar Markov processes, perpetual
integrals of L\'evy processes and fluctuation theory, which have not been used before in the SDE
setting, thereby allowing us to employ classical theory such as Hunt-Nagasawa duality and Getoor's
characterisation of transience and recurrence.
