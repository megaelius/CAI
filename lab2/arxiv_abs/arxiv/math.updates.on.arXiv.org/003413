Let $G$ be a compact Lie group, $N\geq 1$ and $L>0$. The random geometric graph on $G$ is the random
graph $\Gamma(N,L)$ whose vertices are $N$ random points $g_1,\ldots,g_N$ chosen under the Haar
measure of $G$, and whose edges are the pairs $\{g_i,g_j\}$ with $d(g_i,g_j)\leq L$, $d$ being the
distance associated to the standard Riemannian structure on $G$. In this paper, we describe the
asymptotic behavior of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma(N,L)$, when $N$ goes to infinity.
If $L$ is fixed and $N \to + \infty$ (Gaussian regime), then the largest eigenvalues of $\Gamma(N,L)$
converge after an appropriate renormalisation towards certain explicit linear combinations
of values of Bessel functions. If $L = O(N^{-\frac{1}{\dim G}})$ and $N \to +\infty$ (Poissonian
regime), then the random geometric graph $\Gamma(N,L)$ converges in the local Benjamini-Schramm
sense, which implies the weak convergence in probability of the spectral measure of $\Gamma(N,L)$.
In both situations, the representation theory of the group $G$ provides us with informations on
the limit of the spectrum, and conversely, the computation of this limiting spectrum involves many
classical tools from representation theory: Weyl's character formula and the weight lattice in
the Gaussian regime, and a degeneration of these objects in the Poissonian regime. The representation
theoretic approach allows one to understand precisely how the degeneration from the Gaussian to
the Poissonian regime occurs, and the article is written so as to highlight this degeneration phenomenon.
In the Poissonian regime, this approach leads us to an algebraic conjecture on certain functionals
of the irreducible representations of $G$.
