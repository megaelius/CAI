If one considers an integral varifold $I^m\subseteq M$ with bounded mean curvature, and if $S^k(I)\equiv\{x\in
M: \text{ no tangent cone at $x$ is }k+1\text{-symmetric}\}$ is the standard stratification of
the singular set, then it is well known that $\dim S^k\leq k$. In complete generality nothing else
is known about the singular sets $S^k(I)$. In this paper we prove for a general integral varifold
with bounded mean curvature, in particular a stationary varifold, that every stratum $S^k(I)$
is $k$-rectifiable. In fact, we prove for $k$-a.e. point $x\in S^k$ that there exists a unique $k$-plane
$V^k$ such that every tangent cone at $x$ is of the form $V\times C$ for some cone $C$. In the case of
minimizing hypersurfaces $I^{n-1}\subseteq M^n$ we can go further. Indeed, we can show that the
singular set $S(I)$, which is known to satisfy $\dim S(I)\leq n-8$, is in fact $n-8$ rectifiable
with uniformly finite $n-8$ measure. An effective version of this allows us to prove that the second
fundamental form $A$ has apriori estimates in $L^7_{weak}$ on $I$, an estimate which is sharp as
$|A|$ is not in $L^7$ for the Simons cone. In fact, we prove the much stronger estimate that the regularity
scale $r_I$ has $L^7_{weak}$-estimates. The above results are in fact just applications of a new
class of estimates we prove on the quantitative stratifications $S^k_{\epsilon,r}$ and $S^k_{\epsilon}\equiv
S^k_{\epsilon,0}$. Roughly, $x\in S^k_{\epsilon}\subseteq I$ if no ball $B_r(x)$ is $\epsilon$-close
to being $k+1$-symmetric. We show that $S^k_\epsilon$ is $k$-rectifiable and satisfies the Minkowski
estimate $Vol(B_r\,S_\epsilon^k)\leq C_\epsilon r^{n-k}$. The proof requires a new $L^2$-subspace
approximation theorem for integral varifolds with bounded mean curvature, and a $W^{1,p}$-Reifenberg
type theorem proved by the authors in \cite{NaVa+}.
