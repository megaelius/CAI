We construct a new class of finite-dimensional C^*-quantum groupoids at roots of unity q=e^{i\pi/\ell},
with limit the discrete dual of the classical SU(N) for large orders. The representation category
of our groupoid turns out to be tensor equivalent to the well known quotient C^*-category of the category
of tilting modules of the non-semisimple quantum group U_q({\mathfrak sl}_N) of Drinfeld, Jimbo
and Lusztig. As an algebra, the C^*-groupoid is a quotient of U_q({\mathfrak sl}_N). As a coalgebra,
it naturally reflects the categorical quotient construction. In particular, it is not coassociative,
but satisfies axioms of the weak quasi-Hopf C^*-algebras: quasi-coassociativity and non-unitality
of the coproduct. There are also a multiplicative counit, an antipode, and an R-matrix. For this,
we give a general construction of quantum groupoids for complex simple Lie algebras {\mathfrak
g}\neq E_8 and certain roots of unity. Our main tools here are Drinfeld's coboundary associated
to the R-matrix, related to the algebra involution, and certain canonical projections introduced
by Wenzl, which yield the coproduct and Drinfeld's associator in an explicit way. Tensorial properties
of the negligible modules reflect in a rather special nature of the associator. We next reduce the
proof of the categorical equivalence to the problems of establishing semisimplicity and computing
dimension of the groupoid. In the case {\mathfrak g}={\mathfrak sl}_N we construct a (non-positive)
Haar-type functional on an associative version of the dual groupoid satisfying key non-degeneracy
properties. This enables us to complete the proof.
