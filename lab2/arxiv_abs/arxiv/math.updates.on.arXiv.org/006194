To achieve the full passive beamforming gains of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), accurate
channel state information (CSI) is indispensable but practically challenging to acquire, due
to the excessive amount of channel parameters to be estimated which increases with the number of
IRS reflecting elements as well as that of IRS-served users. To tackle this challenge, we propose
in this paper two efficient channel estimation schemes for different channel setups in an IRS-assisted
multi-user broadband communication system employing the orthogonal frequency division multiple
access (OFDMA). The first channel estimation scheme, which estimates the CSI of all users in parallel
simultaneously at the access point (AP), is applicable for arbitrary frequency-selective fading
channels. In contrast, the second channel estimation scheme, which exploits a key property that
all users share the same (common) IRS-AP channel to enhance the training efficiency and support
more users, is proposed for the typical scenario with line-of-sight (LoS) dominant user-IRS channels.
For the two proposed channel estimation schemes, we further optimize their corresponding training
designs (including pilot tone allocations for all users and IRS time-varying reflection pattern)
to minimize the channel estimation error. Moreover, we derive and compare the fundamental limits
on the minimum training overhead and the maximum number of supportable users of these two schemes.
Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation schemes and training
designs, and show their significant performance improvement over various benchmark schemes.
