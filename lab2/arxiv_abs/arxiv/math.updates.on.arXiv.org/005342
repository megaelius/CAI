We propose a general theory to construct functorial assignments $\Sigma \longmapsto \Omega_{\Sigma}
\in E(\Sigma)$ for a large class of functors $E$ from a certain category of bordered surfaces to a
suitable target category of topological vector spaces. The construction proceeds by successive
excisions of homotopy classes of embedded pairs of pants, and thus by induction on the Euler characteristic.
We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the infinite sums appearing in this construction
converge. In particular, we can generate mapping class group invariant vectors $\Omega_{\Sigma}
\in E(\Sigma)$. The initial data for the recursion encode the cases when $\Sigma$ is a pair of pants
or a torus with one boundary, as well as the "recursion kernels" used for glueing. We give this construction
the name of Geometric Recursion (GR). As a first application, we demonstrate that our formalism
produce a large class of measurable functions on the moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces.
Under certain conditions, the functions produced by the geometric recursion can be integrated
with respect to the Weil--Petersson measure on moduli spaces with fixed boundary lengths, and we
show that the integrals satisfy a topological recursion (TR) generalizing the one of Eynard and
Orantin. We establish a generalization of Mirzakhani--McShane identities, namely that multiplicative
statistics of hyperbolic lengths of multicurves can be computed by GR, and thus their integrals
satisfy TR. As a corollary, we find an interpretation of the intersection indices of the Chern character
of bundles of conformal blocks in terms of the aforementioned statistics. The theory has however
a wider scope than functions on Teichm\"uller space, which will be explored in subsequent papers;
one expects that many functorial objects in low-dimensional geometry could be constructed by variants
of our new geometric recursion.
