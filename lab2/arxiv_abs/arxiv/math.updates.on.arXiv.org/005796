Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a finite commutative ring, and let $\mathbb{L}$ be a commutative $\mathbb{K}$-algebra.
Let $A$ and $B$ be two $n \times n$-matrices over $\mathbb{L}$ that have the same characteristic
polynomial. The main result of this paper (Thm.~\ref{thm.finpowmat.main}) states that the set
$\left\{ A^0,A^1,A^2,\ldots\right\}$ is finite if and only if the set $\left\{ B^0,B^1,B^2,\ldots\right\}$
is finite. We apply this result to Cellular Automata (CA). Indeed, it gives a complete and easy-to-check
characterization of sensitivity to initial conditions and equicontinuity for linear CA over the
alphabet $\mathbb{K}^n$ for $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{Z}/m\Z$ (Thm.~\ref{froblca}), \ie, CA in
which the local rule is defined by $n\times n$-matrices with elements in $\mathbb{Z}/m\Z$. To prove
our main result, we derive an integrality criterion for matrices (Thm\ref{thm.finpowmat.char-int}
and Prop.\ref{prop.finpowmat.char-int-conv}) that is likely of independent interest. Namely,
let $\mathbb{K}$ be any commutative ring (not necessarily finite), and let $\mathbb{L}$ be a commutative
$\mathbb{K}$-algebra. Consider any $n \times n$-matrix $A$ over $\mathbb{L}$. Then, $A \in \mathbb{L}^{n
\times n}$ is integral over $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, there exists a monic polynomial $f \in \mathbb{K}\left[t\right]$
satisfying $f\left(A\right) = 0$) if and only if all coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
of $A$ are integral over $\mathbb{K}$. The proof of this fact relies on a strategic use of exterior
powers (a trick pioneered by Gert Almkvist). Furthermore, we extend the decidability result concerning
sensitivity and equicontinuity to the wider class of additive CA over a finite abelian group. For
such CA, we also prove the decidability of injectivity, surjectivity, topological transitivity
and all the properties (as, for instance, ergodicity) that are equivalent to the latter.
