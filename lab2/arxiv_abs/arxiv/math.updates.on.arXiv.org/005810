We prove a "decomposition lemma" that allows us to count preimages of certain sets of permutations
under West's stack-sorting map $s$. As a first application, we give a new proof of Zeilberger's formula
for the number of 2-stack-sortable permutations in $S_n$. Our proof generalizes, allowing us to
find an algebraic equation satisfied by the generating function that counts 2-stack-sortable
permutations according to length, number of descents, and number of peaks. The same method yields
a recurrence relation for $W_3(n)$, the number of 3-stack-sortable permutations in $S_n$. We compute
$W_3(n)$ for $n\le 174$, extending the 13 terms of this sequence that were known before. We also prove
the first nontrivial lower bound for $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}W_3(n)^{1/n}$. Invoking a result
of Kremer, we also prove that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}W_t(n)^{1/n}\geq(\sqrt{t}+1)^2$ for
all $t\geq 1$, which we use to improve a result of Smith. Our computations allow us to disprove a conjecture
of B\'ona, although we do not yet know for sure which one. We can refine our methods to obtain a recurrence
for the number of 3-stack-sortable permutations in $S_n$ with $k$ descents and $p$ peaks. This produces
a large amount of evidence supporting a real-rootedness conjecture of B\'ona. Using part of the
theory of valid hook configurations, we give a new proof of a $\gamma$-nonnegativity result of Br\"and\'en,
which in turn implies an older result of B\'ona. We then answer a question of the current author by
producing a set $A\subseteq S_{11}$ such that $\sum_{\sigma\in s^{-1}(A)}x^{\text{des}(\sigma)}$
has nonreal roots. We interpret this as partial evidence against the same real-rootedness conjecture
of B\'ona that we found evidence supporting. Examining the parities of the numbers $W_3(n)$, we
obtain strong evidence against yet another conjecture of B\'ona. We end with some conjectures of
our own.
