Generalizing wavelets by adding desired redundancy and flexibility,framelets are of interest
and importance in many applications such as image processing and numerical algorithms. Several
key properties of framelets are high vanishing moments for sparse multiscale representation,
fast framelet transforms for numerical efficiency, and redundancy for robustness. However, it
is a challenging problem to study and construct multivariate nonseparable framelets, mainly due
to their intrinsic connections to factorization and syzygy modules of multivariate polynomial
matrices. In this paper, we circumvent the above difficulties through the approach of quasi-tight
framelets, which behave almost identically to tight framelets. Employing the popular oblique
extension principle (OEP), from an arbitrary compactly supported $\dm$-refinable vector function
$\phi$ with multiplicity greater than one, we prove that we can always derive from $\phi$ a compactly
supported multivariate quasi-tight framelet such that (i) all the framelet generators have the
highest possible order of vanishing moments;(ii) its associated fast framelet transform is compact
with the highest balancing order.For a refinable scalar function $\phi$, the above item (ii) often
cannot be achieved intrinsically but we show that we can always construct a compactly supported
OEP-based multivariate quasi-tight framelet derived from $\phi$ satisfying item (i).This paper
provides a comprehensive investigation on OEP-based multivariate quasi-tight multiframelets
and their associated framelet transforms with high balancing orders. This deepens our theoretical
understanding of multivariate quasi-tight multiframelets and their associated fast multiframelet
transforms.
