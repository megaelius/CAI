The Brinkman equations can be regarded as a combination of the Stokes and Darcy equations which model
transitions between the fast flow in channels (governed by Stokes equations) and the slow flow in
porous media (governed by Darcy's law). The numerical challenge for this model is the designing
of a numerical scheme which is stable for both the Stokes-dominated (high permeability) and the
Darcy-dominated (low permeability) equations. In this paper, we solve the Brinkman model in $n$
dimensions ($n = 2, 3$) by using the mixed discontinuous Galerkin (MDG) method, which meets this
challenge. This MDG method is based on the pseudostress-velocity formulation and uses a discontinuous
piecewise polynomial pair $\underline{\bm{\mathcal{P}}}_{k+1}^{\mathbb{S}}$-$\bm{\mathcal{P}}_k$
$(k \geq 0)$, where the stress field is symmetric. The main unknowns are the pseudostress and the
velocity, whereas the pressure is easily recovered through a simple postprocessing. A key step
in the analysis is to establish the parameter-robust inf-sup stability through specific parameter-dependent
norms at both continuous and discrete levels. Therefore, the stability results presented here
are uniform with respect to the permeability. Thanks to the parameter-robust stability analysis,
we obtain optimal error estimates for the stress in broken $\underline{\bm{H}}(\bm{{\rm div}})$-norm
and velocity in $\bm{L}^2$-norm. Furthermore, the optimal $\underline{\bm{L}}^2$ error estimate
for pseudostress is derived under certain conditions. Finally, numerical experiments are provided
to support the theoretical results and to show the robustness, accuracy, and flexibility of the
MDG method.
