In last passage percolation models lying in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, maximizing
paths that travel over distances of order $n$ accrue energy that fluctuates on scale $n^{1/3}$;
and these paths deviate from the linear interpolation of their endpoints on scale $n^{2/3}$. These
maximizing paths and their energies may be viewed via a coordinate system that respects these scalings.
What emerges by doing so is a system indexed by $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $s,t \in \mathbb{R}$ with
$s < t$ of unit order quantities $W_n\big( x,s ; y,t \big)$ specifying the scaled energy of the maximizing
path that moves in scaled coordinates between $(x,s)$ and $(y,t)$. The space-time Airy sheet is,
after a parabolic adjustment, the putative distributional limit $W_\infty$ of this system as $n
\to \infty$. The Airy sheet has recently been constructed in~[15] as such a limit of Brownian last
passage percolation. In this article, we initiate the study of fractal geometry in the Airy sheet.
We prove that the scaled energy difference profile given by $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}: z \to W_\infty
\big( 1,0 ; z,1 \big) - W_\infty \big( -1,0 ; z,1 \big)$ is a non-decreasing process that is constant
in a random neighbourhood of almost every $z \in \mathbb{R}$; and that the exceptional set of $z \in
\mathbb{R}$ that violate this condition almost surely has Hausdorff dimension one-half. Points
of violation correspond to special behaviour for scaled maximizing paths, and we prove the result
by investigating this behaviour, making use of two inputs from recent studies of scaled Brownian
LPP; namely, Brownian regularity of profiles, and estimates on the rarity of pairs of disjoint scaled
maximizing paths that begin and end close to each other.
