We consider the multiple hypothesis testing problem for symmetric quantum state discrimination
between r given states \sigma_1,...,\sigma_r. By splitting up the overall test into multiple binary
tests in various ways we obtain a number of upper bounds on the optimal error probability in terms
of the binary error probabilities. These upper bounds allow us to deduce various bounds on the asymptotic
error rate, for which it has been hypothesised that it is given by the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff
bound (or Chernoff divergence) C(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_r), as recently introduced by Nussbaum
and Szko{\l}a in analogy with Salikhov's classical multi-hypothesis Chernoff bound. This quantity
is defined as the minimum of the pairwise binary Chernoff divergences min_{j<k}C(\sigma_j,\sigma_k).
It was known already that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between C/3 and C, and that for certain
classes of sets of states the bound is actually achieved. It was known to be achieved, in particular,
when the state pair that is closest together in Chernoff divergence is more than 6 times closer than
the next closest pair. Our results improve on this in two ways. Firstly, we show that the optimal asymptotic
rate must lie between C/2 and C. Secondly, we show that the Chernoff bound is already achieved when
the closest state pair is more than 2 times closer than the next closest pair. We also show that the
Chernoff bound is achieved when at least $r-2$ of the states are pure, improving on a previous result
by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a. Finally, we indicate a number of potential pathways along which a proof
(or disproof) may eventually be found that the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound is always
achieved.
