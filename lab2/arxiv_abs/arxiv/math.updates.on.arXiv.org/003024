In this paper, we are concerned with the 2D and 3D geometric shape generation by prescribing a set
of characteristic values of a specific geometric body. One of the major motivations of our study
is the 3D human body generation in various applications. We develop a novel method that can generate
the desired body with customized characteristic values. The proposed method follows a machine-learning
flavour that generates the inferred geometric body with the input characteristic parameters from
a training dataset. One of the critical ingredients and novelties of our method is the borrowing
of inverse scattering techniques in the theory of wave propagation to the body generation. This
is done by establishing a delicate one-to-one correspondence between a geometric body and the far-field
pattern of a source scattering problem governed by the Helmholtz system. It in turn enables us to
establish a one-to-one correspondence between the geometric body space and the function space
defined by the far-field patterns. Hence, the far-field patterns can act as the shape generators.
The shape generation with prescribed characteristic parameters is achieved by first manipulating
the shape generators and then reconstructing the corresponding geometric body from the obtained
shape generator by a stable multiple-frequency Fourier method. Our method is easy to implement
and produces more efficient and stable body generations. We provide both theoretical analysis
and extensive numerical experiments for the proposed method. The study is the first attempt to introduce
inverse scattering approaches in combination with machine learning to the geometric body generation
and it opens up many opportunities for further developments.
