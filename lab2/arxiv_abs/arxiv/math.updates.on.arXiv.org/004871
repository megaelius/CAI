In the optimization under uncertainty, decision-makers first select a wait-and-see policy before
any realization of uncertainty and then place a here-and-now decision after the uncertainty has
been observed. Two-stage stochastic programming is a popular modeling paradigm for the optimization
under uncertainty that the decision-makers first specifies a probability distribution, and then
seek the best decisions to jointly optimize the deterministic wait-and-see and expected here-and-now
costs. In practice, such a probability distribution may not be fully available but is probably observable
through an empirical dataset. Therefore, this paper studies distributionally robust two-stage
stochastic program (DRTSP) which jointly optimizes the deterministic wait-and-see and worst-case
expected here-and-now costs, and the probability distribution comes from a family of distributions
which are centered at the empirical distribution using $\infty-$Wasserstein metric. There have
been successful developments on deriving tractable approximations of the worst-case expected
here-and-now cost in DRTSP. Unfortunately, limited results on exact tractable reformulations
of DRTSP. This paper fills this gap by providing sufficient conditions under which the worst-case
expected here-and-now cost in DRTSP can be efficiently computed via a tractable convex program.
By exploring the properties of binary variables, the developed reformulation techniques are extended
to DRTSP with binary random parameters. The main tractable reformulations in this paper are projected
into the original decision space and thus can be interpreted as conventional two-stage stochastic
programs under discrete support with extra penalty terms enforcing the robustness. These tractable
results are further demonstrated to be sharp through complexity analysis.
