Whereas formal category theory is classically considered within a $2$-category, in this paper
a double-dimensional approach is taken. More precisely we develop such theory within the setting
of augmented virtual double categories, a notion extending that of virtual double category by adding
cells with nullary target. [...] After this the notion of `weak' Kan extension within an augmented
virtual double category is considered, together with three strengthenings. [...] The notion of
yoneda embedding is then considered in an augmented virtual double category, and compared to that
of a good yoneda structure on a $2$-category; the latter in the sense of Street-Walters and Weber.
Conditions are given ensuring that a yoneda embedding $y \colon A \to \hat A$ defines $\hat A$ as the
free small cocompletion of $A$, in a suitable sense. In the second half we consider formal category
theory in the presence of algebraic structures. In detail: to a monad $T$ on an augmented virtual
double category $\mathcal K$ several augmented virtual double categories $T\text-\mathsf{Alg}_{(v,
w)}$ of $T$-algebras are associated, [...]. This is followed by the study of the creation of, amongst
others, left Kan extensions by the forgetful functors $T\text-\mathsf{Alg}_{(v, w)} \to \mathcal
K$. The main motivation of this paper is the description of conditions ensuring that yoneda embeddings
in $\mathcal K$ lift along these forgetful functors, as well as ensuring that such lifted algebraic
yoneda embeddings again define free small cocompletions, now in $T\text-\mathsf{Alg}_{(v, w)}$.
As a first example we apply the previous to monoidal structures on categories, hence recovering
Day convolution of presheaves and Im-Kelly's result on free monoidal cocompletion, as well as obtaining
a "monoidal Yoneda lemma".
