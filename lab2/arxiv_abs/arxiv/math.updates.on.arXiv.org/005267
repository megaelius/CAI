Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the dictionary of Gaussian mixtures: the functions created by affine change
of variables of a single Gaussian in $n$ dimensions. $\mathcal{D}$ is used pervasively in scientific
applications to a degree that practitioners often employ it as their default choice for representing
their scientific object. Its use in applications hinges on the perception that this dictionary
is large enough, and its members are local enough in space and frequency, to provide efficient approximation
to "almost all objects of interest". However, and perhaps surprisingly, only a handful of concrete
theoretical results are actually known on the ability to use Gaussian mixtures in lieu of mainstream
representation systems. The present paper shows that, in 2D, Gaussian mixtures are effective in
resolving anisotropic structures, too. In this setup, the "smoothness class" is comprised of 2D
functions that are sparsely represented using curvelets. An algorithm for $N$-term approximation
from (a small subset of) $\mathcal{D}$ is presented, and the error bounds are then shown to be on par
with the errors of $N$-term curvelet approximation. The latter are optimal, essentially by definition.
Our approach is based on providing effective approximation from $\mathcal{D}$ to the members of
the curvelet system, mimicking the approach in arXiv:0802.2517 and arXiv:0911.2803 where the
mother wavelets are approximated. When the error is measured in the $1$-norm, this adaptation of
the prior approach, combined with standard tools, yields the desired results. However, handling
the $2$-norm case is much more subtle and requires substantial new machinery: in this case, the error
analysis cannot be solely done on the space domain: some of it has to be carried out on frequency. Since,
on frequency, all members of $\mathcal{D}$ are centered at the origin, a delicate analysis for controlling
the error there is needed.
