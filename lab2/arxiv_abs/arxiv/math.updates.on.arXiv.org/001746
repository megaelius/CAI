Mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) is an emerging technology for enhancing mobiles' computation
capabilities and prolonging their battery lives, by offloading intensive computation from mobiles
to nearby servers such as base stations. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient resource-management
policy for the asynchronous MECO system, where the mobiles have heterogeneous input-data arrival
time instants and computation deadlines. First, we consider the general case with arbitrary arrival-deadline
orders. Based on the monomial energy-consumption model for data transmission, an optimization
problem is formulated to minimize the total mobile-energy consumption under the time-sharing
and computation-deadline constraints. The optimal resource-management policy for data partitioning
(for offloading and local computing) and time division (for transmissions) is shown to be computed
by using the block coordinate decent method. To gain further insights, we study the optimal resource-management
design for two special cases. First, consider the case of identical arrival-deadline orders, i.e.,
a mobile with input data arriving earlier also needs to complete computation earlier. The optimization
problem is reduced to two sequential problems corresponding to the optimal scheduling order and
joint data-partitioning and time-division given the optimal order. It is found that the optimal
time-division policy tends to balance the defined effective computing power among offloading
mobiles via time sharing. Furthermore, this solution approach is extended to the case of reverse
arrival-deadline orders. The corresponding time-division policy is derived by a proposed transformation-and-scheduling
approach, which first determines the total offloading duration and data size for each mobile in
the transformation phase and then specifies the offloading intervals for each mobile in the scheduling
phase.
