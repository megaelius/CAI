We propose Quantile Graphical Models (QGMs) to characterize prediction and conditional independence
relationships within a set of random variables of interest. Although those models are of interest
in a variety of applications, we draw our motivation and contribute to the financial risk management
literature. Importantly, the proposed framework is intended to be applied to non-Gaussian settings,
and to handle a large number of variables and conditioning events. We propose two distinct QGMs.
First, Condition Independence Quantile Graphical Models (CIQGMs) characterize conditional
independence at each quantile index revealing the distributional dependence structure. Second,
Prediction Quantile Graphical Models (PQGMs) characterize the best linear predictor under asymmetric
loss functions. A key difference between those models is the (non-vanishing) misspecification
between the best linear predictor and the conditional quantile functions. Due to high-dimensionality,
the two distinct QGMs require different estimators. The estimators are based on high-dimensional
techniques including (a continuum of) $\ell_{1}$-penalized quantile regressions (and low biased
equations), which allow us to handle the potential large number of variables. We obtain new results
for valid choice of the penalty parameters, rates of convergence, and confidence regions that are
simultaneously valid. We illustrate how to use QGMs to quantify tail interdependence (instead
of mean dependence) between a large set of variables which is relevant in applications concerning
with extreme events. We show that the associated tail risk network can be used for measuring systemic
risk contributions. We also apply the framework to study international financial contagion and
the impact of market downside movement on the dependence structure of assets' returns.
