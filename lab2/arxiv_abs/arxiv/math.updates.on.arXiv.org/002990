There exist two conjectures for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) of reducts of finitely
bounded homogeneous structures: the first one states that tractability of the CSP of such a structure
is, when the structure is a model-complete core, equivalent to its polymorphism clone satisfying
a certain non-trivial linear identity modulo outer embeddings. The second conjecture, challenging
the approach via model-complete cores by reflections, states that tractability is equivalent
to the linear identities (without outer embeddings) satisfied by its polymorphisms clone, together
with the natural uniformity on it, being non-trivial. We prove that the identities satisfied in
the polymorphism clone of a structure allow for conclusions about the orbit growth of its automorphism
group, and apply this to show that the two conjectures are equivalent. We contrast this with a counterexample
showing that $\omega$-categoricity alone is insufficient to imply the equivalence of the two conditions
above in a model-complete core. Taking a different approach, we then show how the Ramsey property
of a homogeneous structure can be utilized for obtaining a similar equivalence under different
conditions. We then prove that any polymorphism of sufficiently large arity which is totally symmetric
modulo outer embeddings of a finitely bounded structure can be turned into a non-trivial system
of linear identities, and obtain non-trivial linear identities for all tractable cases of reducts
of the rational order, the random graph, and the random poset. Finally, we provide a new and short
proof, in the language of monoids, of the theorem stating that every $\omega$-categorical structure
is homomorphically equivalent to a model-complete core.
