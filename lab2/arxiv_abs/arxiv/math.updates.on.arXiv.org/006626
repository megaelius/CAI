As a conclusion in classical linear algebra, an underdetermined linear equations usually have
an infinite number of solutions. The sparest one among these solutions is significant in many applications.
This problem can be modeled as the $l_0$-minimization, However, to find the sparsest solution of
an underdetermined linear equations is NP-hard. Therefore, an important approach to solve the
following $l_p$-minimization ($0<p\leq1$), The purpose of this problem is to find a $p$-norm minimization
solution $(0<p\leq1)$ instead of the sparest one. In order to study the equivalence relationship
between $l_0$-minimization and $l_p$-minimization, most of related work adopt Restricted Isometry
Property (RIP) and Restricted Isometry Constant (RIC). On the premise of RIP and RIC, those work
only solve the situation when the solution $\breve{x}$ of $l_0$-minimization satisfies that $\|\breve{x}\|_0<k$
where $k$ is a known fixed constant with $k<\frac{spark(A)}{2}$. One of the results in this paper
is to give an analytic expression $p^*$ such that $l_p$-minimization is equivalent to $l_0$-minimization
for every $\|\breve{x}\|_0<\frac{spark(A)}{2}$. In this paper, we also consider the case where
the matrix $A$ is a Vandermonde matrix and we present an analytic expression $p^*$ such that the solution
of $l_p$-minimization also solve $l_0$-minimization. Compared with the similar results based
on RIP and RIC, we do not need the uniqueness assumption, i.e., the solution $x^*$ of $l_0$-minimization
do not have to be assumed to be the unique solution which is the main breakthrough in our result. Another
superiority of our result is its computability, i.e., each part in the analytic expression can be
easily calculated.
