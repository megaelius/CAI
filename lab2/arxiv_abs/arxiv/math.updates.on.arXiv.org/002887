We study sparse solutions of optimal control problems governed by PDEs with uncertain coefficients.
We propose two formulations, one where the solution is a deterministic control optimizing the mean
objective, and a formulation aiming at stochastic controls that share the same sparsity structure.
In both formulations, regions where the controls do not vanish can be interpreted as optimal locations
for placing control devices. In this paper, we focus on linear PDEs with linearly entering uncertain
parameters. Under these assumptions, the deterministic formulation reduces to a problem with
known structure, and thus we mainly focus on the stochastic control formulation. Here, shared sparsity
is achieved by incorporating the $L^1$-norm of the mean of the pointwise squared controls in the
objective. We reformulate the problem using a norm reweighting function that is defined over physical
space only and thus helps to avoid approximation of the random space using samples or quadrature.
We show that a fixed point algorithm applied to the norm reweighting formulation leads to a variant
of the well-studied iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, and we propose a novel
preconditioned Newton-conjugate gradient method to speed up the IRLS algorithm. We combine our
algorithms with low-rank operator approximations, for which we provide estimates of the truncation
error. We carefully examine the computational complexity of the resulting algorithms. The sparsity
structure of the optimal controls and the performance of the solution algorithms are studied numerically
using control problems governed by the Laplace and Helmholtz equations. In these experiments the
Newton variant clearly outperforms the IRLS method.
