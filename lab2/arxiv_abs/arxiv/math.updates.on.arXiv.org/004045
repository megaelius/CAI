In this paper, we study output feedback selection in linear time-invariant structured systems.
We assume that the inputs and the outputs are dedicated, i.e., each input directly actuates a single
state and each output directly senses a single state. Given a structured system with dedicated inputs
and outputs and a cost matrix that denotes the cost of each feedback connection, our aim is to select
an optimal set of feedback connections such that the closed-loop system satisfies arbitrary pole-placement.
This problem is referred to as the optimal feedback selection problem for dedicated i/o. We first
prove the NP-hardness of the problem using a reduction from a well known NP-hard problem, the weighted
set cover problem. In addition, we also prove that the optimal feedback selection problem for dedicated
i/o is inapproximable to a constant factor of log n, where n denotes the system dimension. To this
end, we propose an algorithm to find an approximate solution to the optimal feedback selection problem
for dedicated i/o. The proposed algorithm consists of a potential function incorporated with a
greedy scheme and attains a solution with a guaranteed approximation ratio. Then we consider two
special network topologies of practical importance, referred to as back-edge feedback structure
and hierarchical networks. For the first case, which is NP-hard and inapproximable to a multiplicative
factor of log n, we provide a (log n)-approximate solution, where n denotes the system dimension.
For hierarchical networks, we give a dynamic programming based algorithm to obtain an optimal solution
in polynomial time.
