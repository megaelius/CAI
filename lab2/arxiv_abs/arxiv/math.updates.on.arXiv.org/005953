We provide a micro-local necessary condition for distinction of admissible representations of
real reductive groups in the context of spherical pairs. Let $\bf G$ be a complex algebraic reductive
group, and $\bf H\subset G$ be a spherical algebraic subgroup. Let $\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h}$
denote the Lie algebras of $\bf G$ and $\bf H$, and let $\mathfrak{h}^{\bot}$ denote the orthogonal
complement to $\mathfrak{h}$ in $\mathfrak{g}^*$. A $\mathfrak{g}$-module is called $\mathfrak{h}$-distinguished
if it admits a non-zero $\mathfrak{h}$-invariant functional. We show that the maximal $\bf G$-orbit
in the annihilator variety of any irreducible $\mathfrak{h}$-distinguished $\mathfrak{g}$-module
intersects $\mathfrak{h}^{\bot}$. This generalizes a result of Vogan. We apply this to Casselman-Wallach
representations of real reductive groups to obtain information on branching problems, translation
functors and Jacquet modules. Further, we prove in most cases that as suggested by [PrSa19, Question
1], when $H$ is a symmetric subgroup of a real reductive group $G$, the existence of a tempered $H$-distinguished
representation of $G$ implies the existence of a generic $H$-distinguished representation of
$G$. Many of the models studied in the theory of automorphic forms involve an additive character
on the unipotent radical of the subgroup $\bf H$, and we devised a twisted version of our theorem that
yields necessary conditions for the existence of those mixed models. Our method of proof here is
based on the theory of modules over $W$-algebras [Los10]. As an application of our theorem we derive
necessary conditions for the existence of Rankin-Selberg, Bessel, Klyachko and Shalika models.
Our results are compatible with the recent Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures for non-generic representations
[GGP].
