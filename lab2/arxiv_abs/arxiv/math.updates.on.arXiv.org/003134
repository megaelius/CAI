It is well known that, given a $2d$ purely magnetic Landau Hamiltonian with a constant magnetic field
$b$ which generates a magnetic flux $\varphi$ per unit area, then any spectral island $\sigma_b$
consisting of $M$ infinitely degenerate Landau levels carries an integrated density of states
$\mathcal{I}_b=M \varphi$. Wannier later discovered a similar Diophantine relation expressing
the integrated density of states of a gapped group of bands of the Hofstadter Hamiltonian as a linear
function of the magnetic field flux with integer slope. We extend this result to a gap labelling theorem
for any $2d$ Bloch-Landau operator $H_b$ which also has a bounded $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic electric
potential. Assume that $H_b$ has a spectral island $\sigma_b$ which remains isolated from the rest
of the spectrum as long as $\varphi$ lies in a compact interval $[\varphi_1,\varphi_2]$. Then $\mathcal{I}_b=c_0+c_1\varphi$
on such intervals, where the constant $c_0\in \mathbb{Q}$ while $c_1\in \mathbb{Z}$. The integer
$c_1$ is the Chern character of the spectral projection onto the spectral island $\sigma_b$. This
result also implies that the Fermi projection on $\sigma_b$, albeit continuous in $b$ in the strong
topology, is nowhere continuous in the norm topology if either $c_1\ne0$ or $c_1=0$ and $\varphi$
is rational. Our proofs, otherwise elementary, do not use non-commutative geometry but are based
on gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory which we briefly review for the sake of the reader.
Moreover, our method allows us to extend the analysis to certain non-covariant systems having slowly
varying magnetic fields.
