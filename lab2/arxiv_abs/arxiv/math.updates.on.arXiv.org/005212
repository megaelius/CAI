We present a stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with a perfectly matched layer (PML) for
three and two space dimensional linear elastodynamics, in velocity-stress formulation, subject
to well-posed linear boundary conditions. First, we consider the elastodynamics equation, in
a cuboidal domain, and derive an unsplit PML truncating the domain using complex coordinate stretching.
Leveraging the hyperbolic structure of the underlying system, we construct continuous energy
estimates, in the time domain for the elastic wave equation, and in the Laplace space for a sequence
of PML model problems, with variations in one, two and three space dimensions, respectively. They
correspond to PMLs normal to boundary faces, along edges and in corners. Second, we develop a DG numerical
method for the linear elastodynamics equation using physically motivated numerical flux and penalty
parameters, which are compatible with all well-posed, internal and external, boundary conditions.
When the PML damping vanishes, by construction, our choice of penalty parameters yield an upwind
scheme and a discrete energy estimate analogous to the continuous energy estimate. Third, to ensure
numerical stability of the discretization when PML damping is present, it is necessary to extend
the numerical DG fluxes, and the numerical inter-element and boundary procedures, to the PML auxiliary
differential equations. This is crucial for deriving discrete energy estimates analogous to the
continuous energy estimates. By combining the DG spatial approximation with the high order ADER
time stepping scheme and the accuracy of the PML we obtain an arbitrarily accurate wave propagation
solver in the time domain. Numerical experiments are presented in two and three space dimensions
corroborating the theoretical results.
