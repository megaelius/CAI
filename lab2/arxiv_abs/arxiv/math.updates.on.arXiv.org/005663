In the theory of orthogonal polynomials, as well as in its intersection with harmonic analysis,
it is an important problem to decide whether a given orthogonal polynomial sequence $(P_n(x))_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$
satisfies nonnegative linearization of products, i.e., the product of any two $P_m(x),P_n(x)$
is a conical combination of the polynomials $P_{|m-n|}(x),\ldots,P_{m+n}(x)$. Since the coefficients
in the arising expansions are often of cumbersome structure or not explicitly available, such considerations
are generally very nontrivial. In 1970, G. Gasper was able to determine the set $V$ of all pairs $(\alpha,\beta)\in(-1,\infty)^2$
for which the corresponding Jacobi polynomials $(R_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x))_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$,
normalized by $R_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(1)\equiv1$, satisfy nonnegative linearization of products.
In 2005, R. Szwarc asked to solve the analogous problem for the generalized Chebyshev polynomials
$(T_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x))_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$, which are the quadratic transformations
of the Jacobi polynomials and orthogonal w.r.t. the measure $(1-x^2)^{\alpha}|x|^{2\beta+1}\chi_{(-1,1)}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$.
In this paper, we give the solution and show that $(T_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x))_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$
satisfies nonnegative linearization of products if and only if $(\alpha,\beta)\in V$, so the generalized
Chebyshev polynomials share this property with the Jacobi polynomials. Moreover, we reconsider
the Jacobi polynomials themselves, simplify Gasper's original proof and characterize strict
positivity of the linearization coefficients. Our results can also be regarded as sharpenings
of Gasper's one.
