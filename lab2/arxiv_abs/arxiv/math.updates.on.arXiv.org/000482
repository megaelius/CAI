Accurate analysis and forecasting of tidal level are very important tasks for human activities
in oceanic and coastal areas. They can be crucial in catastrophic situations like occurrences of
Tsunamis in order to provide a rapid alerting to the human population involved and to save lives.
Conventional tidal forecasting methods are based on harmonic analysis using the least squares
method to determine harmonic parameters. However, a large number of parameters and long-term measured
data are required for precise tidal level predictions with harmonic analysis. Furthermore, traditional
harmonic methods rely on models based on the analysis of astronomical components and they can be
inadequate when the contribution of non-astronomical components, such as the weather, is significant.
Other alternative approaches have been developed in the literature in order to deal with these situations
and provide predictions with the desired accuracy, with respect also to the length of the available
tidal record. These methods include standard high or band pass filtering techniques, although
the relatively deterministic character and large amplitude of tidal signals make special techniques,
like artificial neural networks and wavelets transform analysis methods, more effective. This
paper is intended to provide the communities of both researchers and practitioners with a broadly
applicable, up to date coverage of tidal analysis and forecasting methodologies that have proven
to be successful in a variety of circumstances, and that hold particular promise for success in the
future. Classical and novel methods are reviewed in a systematic and consistent way, outlining
their main concepts and components, similarities and differences, advantages and disadvantages.
