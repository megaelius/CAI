Sample spatial-sign covariance matrix is a much-valued alternative to sample covariance matrix
in robust statistics to mitigate influence of outliers. Although this matrix is widely studied
in the literature, almost nothing is known on its properties when the number of variables becomes
large as compared to the sample size. This paper for the first time investigates the large-dimensional
limits of the eigenvalues of a sample spatial sign matrix when both the dimension and the sample size
tend to infinity. A first result of the paper establishes that the distribution of the eigenvalues
converges to a deterministic limit that belongs to the family of celebrated generalized Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur
distributions. Using tools from random matrix theory, we further establish a new central limit
theorem for a general class of linear statistics of these sample eigenvalues. In particular, asymptotic
normality is established for sample spectral moments under mild conditions. This theory is established
when the population is elliptically distributed. As applications, we first develop two new tools
for estimating the population eigenvalue distribution of a large spatial sign covariance matrix,
and then for testing the order of such population eigenvalue distribution when these distributions
are finite mixtures. Using these inference tools and considering the problem of blind source separation,
we are able to show by simulation experiments that in high-dimensional situations, the sample spatial-sign
covariance matrix is still a valid and much better alternative to sample covariance matrix when
samples contain outliers.
