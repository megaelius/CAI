We develop strong and weak maximum principles for boundary-degenerate elliptic and parabolic
linear second-order partial differential operators, $Au := -\mathrm{tr}(aD^2u)-<b, Du> + cu$,
with partial Dirichlet boundary conditions. The coefficient, $a(x)$, is assumed to vanish along
a non-empty open subset, $\partial_0\mathscr{O}$, called the \emph{degenerate boundary portion},
of the boundary, $\partial\mathscr{O}$, of the domain $\mathscr{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, while
$a(x)$ is non-zero at any point of the \emph{non-degenerate boundary portion}, $\partial_1\mathscr{O}
:= \partial\mathscr{O}\setminus\overline{\partial_0\mathscr{O}}$. If an $A$-subharmonic
function, $u$ in $C^2(\mathscr{O})$ or $W^{2,d}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathscr{O})$, is $C^1$ up
to $\partial_0\mathscr{O}$ and has a strict local maximum at a point in $\partial_0\mathscr{O}$,
we show that $u$ can be perturbed, by the addition of a suitable function $w\in C^2(\mathscr{O})\cap
C^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, to a strictly $A$-subharmonic function $v=u+w$ having a local maximum in
the interior of $\mathscr{O}$. Consequently, we obtain strong and weak maximum principles for
$A$-subharmonic functions in $C^2(\mathscr{O})$ and $W^{2,d}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathscr{O})$
which are $C^1$ up to $\partial_0\mathscr{O}$. Only the non-degenerate boundary portion, $\partial_1\mathscr{O}$,
is required for boundary comparisons. Our results extend those in Daskalopoulos and Hamilton (1998),
Epstein and Mazzeo [arXiv:1110.0032], and the author [arXiv:1204.6613, 1306.5197], where $\mathrm{tr}(aD^2u)$
is in addition assumed to be continuous up to and vanish along $\partial_0\mathscr{O}$ in order
to yield comparable maximum principles for $A$-subharmonic functions in $C^2(\mathscr{O})$,
while the results developed here for $A$-subharmonic functions in $W^{2,d}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathscr{O})$
are entirely new.
