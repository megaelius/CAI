This thesis is devoted to the study of dynamical symmetry enhancement of black hole horizons in string
theory. In particular, we consider supersymmetric horizons in the low energy limit of string theory
known as supergravity and we prove the $\textit{horizon conjecture}$ for a number of supergravity
theories. We first give important examples of symmetry enhancement in $D=4$ and the mathematical
preliminaries required for the analysis. Type IIA supergravity is the low energy limit of $D=10$
IIA string theory, but also the dimensional reduction of $D=11$ supergravity which itself the low
energy limit of M-theory. We prove that Killing horizons in IIA supergravity with compact spatial
sections preserve an even number of supersymmetries. By analyzing the global properties of the
Killing spinors, we prove that the near-horizon geometries undergo a supersymmetry enhancement.
This follows from a set of generalized Lichnerowicz-type theorems we establish, together with
an index theory argument. We also show that the symmetry algebra of horizons with non-trivial fluxes
includes an $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ subalgebra. As an intermediate step in the proof,
we also demonstrate new Lichnerowicz type theorems for spin bundle connections whose holonomy
is contained in a general linear group. We prove the same result for Roman's Massive IIA supergravity.
We also consider the near-horizon geometry of supersymmetric extremal black holes in un-gauged
and gauged 5-dimensional supergravity, coupled to abelian vector multiplets. We consider important
examples in $D=5$ such as the BMPV and supersymmetric black ring solution, and investigate the near-horizon
geometry to show the enhancement of the symmetry algebra of the Killing vectors. We repeat a similar
analysis as above to prove the horizon conjecture. We also investigate the conditions on the geometry
of the spatial horizon section $\cal{S}$.
