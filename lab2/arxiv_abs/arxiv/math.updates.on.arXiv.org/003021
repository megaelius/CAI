In this paper we consider the minimization of the functional \[ J[u]:=\int_\Omega |\Delta u|^2+\chi_{\{u>0\}}
\] in the admissible class of functions \[ \mathcal A:= \left\{u\in W^{2, 2}(\Omega) {\mbox{ s.t.
}} u-u_0\in W^{1,2}_0(\Omega) \right\}. \] Here, $\Omega$ is a smooth and bounded domain and $u_0\in
W^{2,2}(\Omega)$ is a given function defining the Navier type boundary condition. The scale invariance
of the problem suggests that, at the singular points of the free boundary, quadratic growth of $u$
is expected. We prove that $u$ is quadratically nondegenerate at the singular free boundary points
using a refinement of Whitney's cube decomposition, which applies, if, for instance, the set $\{
u>0\}$ is a John domain. The optimal growth is linked with the approximate symmetries of the free
boundary. More precisely, if at small scales the free boundary can be approximated by zero level
sets of a quadratic degree two homogeneous polynomial, then we say that $\partial\{ u>0\}$ is rank-2
flat. Using a dichotomy method for nonlinear free boundary problems, we also show that, at the free
boundary points $x\in \Omega$ where $\nabla u(x)=0$, the free boundary is either well approximated
by zero sets of quadratic polynomials, i.e. $\partial\{ u>0\}$ is rank-2 flat, or $u$ has quadratic
growth. Differently from the classical free boundary problems driven by the Laplacian operator,
the one-phase minimizers present structural differences with respect to the minimizers, and one
notion is not included into the other. In addition, one-phase minimizers arise from the combination
of a volume type free boundary problem and an obstacle type problem, hence their growth condition
is influenced in a non-standard way by these two ingredients.
