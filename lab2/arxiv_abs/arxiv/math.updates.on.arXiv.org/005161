We revisit symplectic properties of the monodromy map for Fuchsian systems on the Riemann sphere
and elucidate the role of the isomonodromic tau-function in this context. We extend previous results
of [Hitchin, Alekseev-Malkin, Korotkin-Samtleben] where it was shown that the monodromy map is
a Poisson morphism between the Kirillov-Kostant Poisson structure on the space of coefficients,
on one side, and the Goldman bracket on the monodromy character variety on the other. The extension
is provided by defining larger spaces on both sides which are equipped with symplectic structures
naturally projecting to the canonical ones. On the coefficient side our symplectic structure corresponds
to a non-degenerate quadratic Poisson structure expressed via the rational dynamical $r$-matrix;
it reduces to the Kirillov-Kostant bracket when projected to the standard space. On the monodromy
side we get a symplectic structure which induces the symplectic structure of [Alekseev-Malkin]
on the leaves of the Goldman Poisson bracket. We prove that the monodromy map provides a symplectomorphism
using the formalism of Malgrange and one of the authors [Bertola]. As a corollary we prove the recent
conjecture by A.Its, O.Lisovyy and A.Prokhorov in its "strong" version while the original "weak"
version is derived from previously known results. We show also that the isomonodromic Jimbo-Miwa
tau-function can be interpreted as the generating function of the monodromy symplectomorphism.
The symplectic potential on the extended monodromy manifold can be constructed using Fock-Goncharov
coordinates. This leads to defining equations for the isomonodromic tau-function with respect
to the full set of monodromy data.
