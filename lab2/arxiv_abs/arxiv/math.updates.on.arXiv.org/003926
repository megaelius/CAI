We study the classical single-item inventory system in which unsatisfied demands are backlogged.
Replenishment lead times are random, independent identically distributed, causing orders to
cross in time. We develop a new inventory policy to exploit implications of lead time randomness
and order crossover, and evaluate its performance by asymptotic analysis and simulations. Our
policy does not follow the basic principle of Constant Base Stock (CBS) policy, or more generally,
$(s,S)$ and $(r,Q)$ policies, which is to keep the inventory position within a fixed range. Instead,
it uses the current inventory level (= inventory-on-hand minus backlog) to set a dynamic target
for inventory in-transit, and place orders to follow this target. Our policy includes CBS policy
as a special case, under a particular choice of a policy parameter. We show that our policy can significantly
reduce the average inventory cost compared with CBS policy. Specifically, we prove that if the lead
time is exponentially distributed, then under our policy, with properly chosen policy parameters,
the expected (absolute) inventory level scales as $o(\sqrt{r})$, as the demand rate $r\to \infty$.
In comparison, it is known to scale as $O(\sqrt{r})$ under CBS policy. In particular, this means
that, as $r\to\infty$, the average inventory cost under our policy vanishes in comparison with
that under CBS policy. Furthermore, our simulations show that the advantage of our policy remains
to be substantial under non-exponential lead time distributions, and may even be greater than under
exponential distribution. We also use simulations to compare GBS to an optimal policy for some cases
where computing the optimal cost is tractable. The results show that our policy removes a majority
of excess costs of CBS policy over the minimum cost, leading to much smaller optimality gaps.
