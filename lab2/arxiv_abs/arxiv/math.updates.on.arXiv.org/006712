Given a finite set of integers $A$, its sumset is $A+A:= \{a_i+a_j \mid a_i,a_j\in A\}$. We examine
$|A+A|$ as a random variable, where $A\subset I_n = [0,n-1]$, the set of integers from 0 to $n-1$,
so that each element of $I_n$ is in $A$ with a fixed probability $p \in (0,1)$. Recently, Martin and
O'Bryant studied the case in which $p=1/2$ and found a closed form for $\mathbb{E}[|A+A|]$. Lazarev,
Miller, and O'Bryant extended the result to find a numerical estimate for $\text{Var}(|A+A|)$
and bounds on $m_{n\,;\,p}(k) := \mathbb{P}(2n-1-|A+A|=k)$. Their primary tool was a graph-theoretic
framework which we now generalize to provide a closed form for $\mathbb{E}[|A+A|]$ and $\text{Var}(|A+A|)$
for all $p\in (0,1)$ and establish good bounds for $\mathbb{E}[|A+A|]$ and $m_{n\,;\,p}(k)$.\\
\indent We continue to investigate $m_{n\,;\,p}(k)$ by studying $m_p(k) = \lim_{n\to\infty}m_{n\,;\,p}(k)$,
proven to exist by Zhao. Lazarev, Miller, and O'Bryant proved that, for $p=1/2$, $m_{1/2}(6)>m_{1/2}(7)<m_{1/2}(8)$.
This distribution is not unimodal, and is said to have a "divot" at 7. We report results investigating
this divot as $p$ varies, and through both theoretical and numerical analysis prove that for $p\geq
0.68$ there is a divot at $1$; that is, $m_{1/2}(0)>m_{1/2}(1)<m_{1/2}(2)$.\\ \indent Finally,
we extend the graph-theoretic framework originally introduced by Lazarev, Miller, and O'Bryant
to correlated sumsets $A+B$ where $B$ is correlated to $A$ by the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(i\in
B \mid i\in A) = p_1$ and $\mathbb{P}(i\in B \mid i\not\in A) = p_2$. We provide some preliminary results
using the extension of this framework.
