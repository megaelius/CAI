The family of complex Grassmann manifolds $G_{n,k}$ with the canonical action of the torus $T^n=\mathbb{T}^{n}$
and the analogous of the moment map $\mu : G_{n,k}\to \Delta_{n,k}$ for the hypersimplex $\Delta_{n,k}$,
is well known. In this paper we study the structure of the orbit space $G_{n,k}/T^n$ by developing
the methods of the toric geometry and the toric topology. We use the subdivision of $G_{n,k}$ into
the strata $W_{\sigma}$. Appealing on this subdivision we describe all regular and singular points
of the moment map $\mu$, introduce the notion of the admissible polytopes $P_\sigma$ such that $\mu
(W_{\sigma}) = \stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}}$ and the notion of the spaces of parameters $F_{\sigma}$,
which together parametrize $W_{\sigma}/T^{n}\cong \stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}} \times F_{\sigma}$.
To find the appropriate topology for the set $\cup_{\sigma} \stackrel{\circ}{P_{\sigma}} \times
F_{\sigma}$ we introduce also the notions of the universal space of parameters $\hat{\mathcal{F}}$
and the virtual spaces of parameters $\tilde{F}_{\sigma}\subset \hat{\mathcal{F}}$ such that
there exist the projections $\tilde{F}_{\sigma}\to F_{\sigma}$. Using this we propose the method
for the description of the orbit space $G_{n,k}/T^n$. The existence of the symmetric group $S_{n}$-action
on $G_{n,k}$ simplifies the application of this method. In our previous paper we proved that $G_{4,2}/T^4$,
which is the space of complexity $1$, is homeomorphic to $\partial \Delta_{4,2}\ast \mathbb{C}
P^1$. In this paper we obtain explicit description of the orbit space $G_{5,2}/T^5$, which is the
non-trivial example of the space of complexity $2$, and prove that it is homotopy equivalent to $\partial
\Delta_{5,2}\ast \mathbb{C} P^{2}$. The methods and the results of this paper are very important
for the construction of the theory of $(2l,q)$-manifolds we recently have been developing.
