In the 1970's, Serre exploited congruences between $q$-expansion coefficients of Eisenstein
series to produce $p$-adic families of Eisenstein series and, in turn, $p$-adic zeta functions.
Partly through integration with more recent machinery, including Katz's approach to $p$-adic
differential operators, his strategy has influenced four decades of developments. Prior papers
employing Katz's and Serre's ideas exploiting differential operators and congruences to produce
families of automorphic forms rely crucially on $q$-expansions of automorphic forms. The overarching
goal of the present paper is to adapt the strategy to automorphic forms on unitary groups, which lack
$q$-expansions when the signature is of the form $(a, b)$, $a\neq b$. In particular, this paper completely
removes the restrictions on the signature present in prior work. As intermediate steps, we achieve
two key objectives. First, partly by carefully analyzing the action of the Young symmetrizer on
Serre-Tate expansions, we explicitly describe the action of differential operators on the Serre-Tate
expansions of automorphic forms on unitary groups of arbitrary signature. As a direct consequence,
for each unitary group, we obtain congruences and families analogous to those studied by Katz and
Serre. Second, via a novel lifting argument, we construct a $p$-adic measure taking values in the
space of $p$-adic automorphic forms on unitary groups of any prescribed signature. We relate the
values of this measure to an explicit $p$-adic family of Eisenstein series. One application of our
results is to the recently completed construction of $p$-adic $L$-functions for unitary groups
by the first named author, Harris, Li, and Skinner.
