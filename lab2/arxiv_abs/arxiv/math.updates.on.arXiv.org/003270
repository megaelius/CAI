Coalescing random walks is a fundamental stochastic process, where a set of particles perform independent
discrete-time random walks on an undirected graph. Whenever two or more particles meet at a given
node, they merge and continue as a single random walk. The coalescence time is defined as the expected
time until only one particle remains, starting from one particle at every node. Despite recent progress
the coalescence time for graphs such as binary trees, d-dimensional tori, hypercubes and more generally,
vertex-transitive graphs, remains unresolved. We provide a powerful toolkit that results in tight
bounds for various topologies including the aforementioned ones. The meeting time is defined as
the worst-case expected time required for two random walks to arrive at the same node at the same time.
As a general result, we establish that for graphs whose meeting time is only marginally larger than
the mixing time (a factor of log^2 n), the coalescence time of n random walks equals the meeting time
up to constant factors. This upper bound is complemented by the construction of a graph family demonstrating
that this result is the best possible up to constant factors. For almost-regular graphs, we bound
the coalescence time by the hitting time, resolving the discrete-time variant of a conjecture by
Aldous for this class of graphs. Finally, we prove that for any graph the coalescence time is bounded
by O(n^3) (which is tight for the Barbell graph); surprisingly even such a basic question about the
coalescing time was not answered before this work. By duality, our results give bounds on the voter
model and therefore give bounds on the consensus time in arbitrary undirected graphs. We also establish
a new bound on the hitting time and cover time of regular graphs, improving and tightening previous
results by Broder and Karlin, as well as those by Aldous and Fill.
