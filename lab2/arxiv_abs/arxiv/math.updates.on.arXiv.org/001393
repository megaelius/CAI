The goal of this work is to elaborate on new geometric methods of constructing exact and parametric
quasiperiodic solutions for anamorphic cosmology models in modified gravity theories, MGTs,
and general relativity, GR. There exist previously studied generic off-diagonal and diagonalizable
cosmological metrics encoding gravitational and matter fields with quasicrystal like structures,
QC, and holonomy corrections from loop quantum gravity, LQG. We apply the anholonomic frame deformation
method, AFDM, in order to decouple the (modified) gravitational and matter field equations in general
form. This allows us to find integral varieties of cosmological solutions determined by generating
functions, effective sources, integration functions and constants. The coefficients of metrics
and connections for such cosmological configurations depend, in general, on all spacetime coordinates
and can be chosen to generate observable (quasi)-periodic/ aperiodic/ fractal / stochastic / (super)
cluster / filament / polymer like (continuous, stochastic, fractal and/or discrete structures)
in MGTs and/or GR. In this work, we study new classes of solutions for anamorphic cosmology with LQG
holonomy corrections. Such solutions are characterized by nonlinear symmetries of generating
functions for generic off--diagonal cosmological metrics and generalized connections, with
possible nonholonomic constraints to Levi-Civita configurations and diagonalizable metrics
depending only on a time like coordinate. We argue that anamorphic quasiperiodic cosmological
models integrate the concept of quantum discrete spacetime, with certain gravitational QC-like
vacuum and nonvacuum structures. And, that of a contracting universe that homogenizes, isotropizes
and flattens without introducing initial conditions or multiverse problems.
