The paper develops non-Archimedean geometry over Henselian valued fields with analytic structure;
the case of complete rank one valued fields with the Tate algebra of strictly convergent power series
being a classical example. The algebraic case was treated in our previous papers. Here we are going
to carry over the research to the general analytic settings. We also prove that certain natural rings
of analytic functions are excellent and regular. Several results are established as, for instance,
piecewise continuity of definable functions, curve selection for definable sets, several versions
of the {\L}ojasiewicz inequality or H\"older continuity of definable functions continuous on
closed bounded subsets of the affine space. Likewise as before, at the center of our approach is the
closedness theorem to the effect that every projection with closed bounded fiber is a definably
closed map. It enables application of resolution of singularities and of transformation to a normal
crossing by blowing up (here applied to certain rings of analytic functions) in much the same way
as over locally compact ground fields. Here we rely on elimination of valued field quantifiers,
term structure of definable functions and b-minimal cell decomposition, due to Cluckers--Lipshitz,
as well as on relative quantifier elimination for ordered abelian groups, due to Cluckers--Halupczok.
Besides, other two ingredients of the proof of the closedness theorem are existence of the limit
(after finite partitioning of the domain) for a definable function of one variable and fiber shrinking,
being a relaxed version of curve selection.
