The Lorentz gas is one of the simplest and most widely-studied models for particle transport in matter.
It describes a cloud of non-interacting gas particles in an infinitely extended array of identical
spherical scatterers, whose radii are small compared to their mean separation. The model was introduced
by Lorentz in 1905 who, following the pioneering ideas of Maxwell and Boltzmann, postulated that
its macroscopic transport properties should be governed by a linear Boltzmann equation. The linear
Boltzmann equation has since proved a useful tool in the description of various phenomena, including
semiconductor physics and radiative transfer. A rigorous derivation of the linear Boltzmann equation
from the underlying particle dynamics was given, for random scatterer configurations, in three
seminal papers by Gallavotti, Spohn and Boldrighini-Bunimovich-Sinai. The objective of the present
study is to develop an approach for a large class of deterministic scatterer configurations, including
various types of quasicrystals. We prove the convergence of the particle dynamics to transport
processes that are in general (depending on the scatterer configuration) not described by the linear
Boltzmann equation. This was previously understood only in the case of the periodic Lorentz gas
through work of Caglioti-Golse and Marklof-Str\"ombergsson. Our results extend beyond the classical
Lorentz gas with hard sphere scatterers, and in particular hold for general classes of spherically
symmetric finite-range potentials. We employ a rescaling technique that randomises the point
configuration given by the scatterers' centers. The limiting transport process is then expressed
in terms of a point process that arises as the limit of the randomised point configuration under a
certain volume-preserving one-parameter linear group action.
