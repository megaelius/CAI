Thermo-acoustic tomography is a non-invasive medical imaging technique, constituting a precise
and cheap alternative to X-imaging. The principle is to excite a body to reconstruct with a pulse
inducing an inhomogeneous heating and therefore expansion of tissues. This creates an acoustic
wave pressure which is measured with sensors. The reconstruction of heterogeneities inside the
body can be then performed by solving an inverse problem, knowing measurements of the acoustic waves
outside the body. As the intensity of the measured pressure is expected to be small, a challenging
problem consists in locating the sensors in a adequate way. This paper is devoted to the determination
of an optimal sensors location to achieve this reconstruction. We first introduce a model involving
a least square functional standing for an observation of the pressure for a first series of measures
by sensors, and an observability-like constant functional describing for the quality of reconstruction.
Then, we determine an appropriate location of sensors for two series of measures, in two steps: first,
we reconstruct possible initial data by solving a worst-case design like problem. Second, we determine
from the knowledge of these initial conditions the optimal location of sensors for observing in
the best way the corresponding solution of the wave equation. Far from providing an intrinsic solution
to the general issue of locating sensors, solving this problem allows to determine a new sensors
location improving the quality of reconstruction before getting a new series of measures. We perform
a mathematical analysis of this model: in particular we investigate existence issues and introduce
a numerical algorithm to solve it. Eventually, several numerical 2D simulations illustrate our
approach.
