We extend some results of group representation theory and von Neumann algebras to the quaternionic
Hilbert space case, proving the double commutant theorem (whose quaternionic proof requires a
different procedure) and extend to the quaternionic case a result concerning the classification
of irreducible von Neumann algebras. Secondly, we consider elementary relativistic systems in
Wigner's view defined as a locally-faithful irreducible strongly-continuous unitary representation
of Poincar\'e group in quaternionic Hilbert space. We prove that, if the squared-mass operator
is non-negative, the system admits a natural, Poincar\'e invariant and unique up to sign, complex
structure commuting with the observables of the system leading to a physically equivalent reformulation
in complex Hilbert space. Differently from the quaternionic formulation, all selfadjoint operators
are now observables, Noether theorem holds and composite systems may be given in terms of tensor
product. In the third part, we use a physically more accurate notion of relativistic elementary
system: irreducibility regards the algebra of observables only, symmetries are automorphisms
of the restricted lattice of elementary propositions and we adopt a notion of continuity referred
to the states viewed as probability measures on the elementary propositions. We prove that again
there exists a unique (up to sign) Poincar\'e invariant complex structure making the theory complex.
Relativistic elementary systems are naturally and better described in complex Hilbert spaces
even if starting from a real or quaternionic Hilbert space formulations and this complex description
is uniquely fixed by physics.
