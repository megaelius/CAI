In this thesis we propose a novel method to compute higher-order corrections to physical cross sections,
bypassing more traditional approaches. This technique, the Four-Dimensional Unsubtraction
(FDU), is based on the Loop-Tree Duality (LTD) theorem, and aims at building pure four-dimensional
representations of scattering amplitudes at higher orders in perturbation theory. This is done
by locally renormalising the virtual contribution at high energies, and then mapping the kinematics
of the corresponding real contribution so it matches the virtual one in the soft and collinear limits.
This makes the ultraviolet and infrared singularities vanish at the integrand level when taking
the sum of both contributions, meaning that the four-dimensional limit can be taken before integrating,
thus allowing for a straightforward numerical implementation. We apply this method for the first
time to calculate the decay of a virtual photon to two massless quarks, and then generalise the method
to massive particles. We also show new advantages provided by the LTD formalism. One of them is the
possibility to write one- and two-loop scattering amplitudes in a universal form at the integrand
level, regardless of the nature of the particle running inside the loop. The other is to perform integrand-level
asymptotic expansions in the internal mass - without having to rely on expansion-by-region techniques
- by taking advantage of the Euclidean nature of the integration domain. Finally, we present a new
algorithm to locally renormalise two-loop amplitudes, where the renormalisation scheme can be
easily fixed through subleading contributions in the ultraviolet region.
