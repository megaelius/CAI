Independent Component Analysis (ICA) recently has attracted much attention in the statistical
literature as an attractive and useful alternative to elliptical models. Whereas k-dimensional
elliptical densities depend on one single unspecified radial density, however, k-dimensional
independent component distributions involve k unspecified component densities, which makes
the statistical analysis much harder in practice. We focus here on the estimation of the mixing/demixing
matrix in ICA from an independent sample. Traditional methods (FOBI, Kernel-ICA, FastICA) mainly
originate from the engineering literature and have statistical properties that are not well known.
They also typically require large samples, as does the "classical semiparametric" approach by
Chen and Bickel (2006), which is based on estimating the k component densities (i.e. the unobserved
independent components). As a reaction, an efficient (signed-)rank-based approach has been proposed
by Ilmonen and Paindaveine (2011) for the case of symmetric component densities; their estimators
unfortunately fail to be root-n consistent as soon as one of the component densities violates the
symmetry assumption. In this paper, using ranks rather than signed ranks, we extend their approach
to the asymmetric case and propose a one-step R-estimator for ICA mixing matrices. The finite-sample
performances of those estimators are investigated and compared to those of existing methods under
moderately large sample sizes. Particularly good performances are obtained from a version involving
data-driven scores taking into account the skewness and kurtosis of residuals. Finally, we show,
by an empirical exercise, that our methods also may provide excellent results in contexts such as
image analysis, where the basic assumptions of ICA are quite unlikely to hold.
