Yannakakis' Clique versus Independent Set problem (CL-IS) in communication complexity asks for
the minimum number of cuts separating cliques from stable sets in a graph, called CS-separator.
Yannakakis provides a quasi-polynomial CS-separator, i.e. of size O(n^log n), and addresses the
problem of finding a polynomial CS-separator. This question is still open even for perfect graphs.
We show that a polynomial CS-separator almost surely exists for random graphs. Besides, if H is a
split graph (i.e. has a vertex-partition into a clique and a stable set) then there exists a constant
c_H for which we find a O(n^c_H) CS-separator on the class of H-free graphs. This generalizes a result
of Yannakakis on comparability graphs. We also provide a O(n^c_k) CS-separator on the class of graphs
without induced path of length k and its complement. Observe that on one side, c_H is of order O(|H|
log |H|) resulting from Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, and on the other side, c_k is a tower function,
due to an application of the regularity lemma. One of the main reason why Yannakakis' CL-IS problem
is fascinating is that it admits equivalent formulations. Our main result in this respect is to show
that a polynomial CS-separator is equivalent to the polynomial Alon-Saks-Seymour Conjecture,
asserting that if a graph has an edge-partition into k complete bipartite graphs, then its chromatic
number is polynomially bounded in terms of k. We also show that the classical approach to the stubborn
problem (arising in CSP) which consists in covering the set of all solutions by O(n^log n) instances
of 2-SAT is again equivalent to the existence of a polynomial CS-separator.
