Following attempts at an analytic proof of the Pentagonal Number Theorem, we report on the discovery
of a general principle leading to the unexpected cancellation of oscillating sums, of which $\sum_{n^2\leq
x}(-1)^ne^{\sqrt{x-n^2}}$ is an example (to get the idea of the result). After stating the motivation,
and our theorem, we apply it to prove a number of results on integer partitions, the distribution
of prime numbers, and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott Problem. Regarding the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott
problem, we show that \begin{align*} \sum_{|\ell|\leq x}(4x^2-4\ell^2)^{2r}-\sum_{|\ell|<x}(4x^2-(2\ell+1)^2)^{2r}=\text{polynomial
w.r.t. } x \text{ with degree }2r-1. \end{align*} Using this result, we solve an approximate version
of the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott Problem, and in doing so we give some evidence that a certain pigeonhole
argument for solving the exact version of the Problem can be improved. Also we prove $$ \sum_{\ell^2
< x} (-1)^\ell p(x-\ell^2)\ \sim\ 2^{-3/4} x^{-1/4} \sqrt{p(x)}, $$ where $p(x)$ is the usual partition
function; and also prove the following "Pentagonal Number Theorem for the Primes", which counts
the number of primes (with von Mangoldt weight) in a set of intervals very precisely: $$ \sum_{0 \leq
2\ell < \sqrt{xT}} \Psi([e^{\sqrt{x - (2\ell)^2/T}},\ e^{\sqrt{x - (2\ell-1)^2/T}}])\ =\ {\Psi(e^{\sqrt{x}})
\over 2}\ +\ O\left ( e^{\sqrt{x}} T^{-\frac{1}{4} + o(1)} \right ), $$ where $T = e^{4\alpha \sqrt{x}/3}$,
where $\alpha = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^2}}$, where $\Psi([a,b]) := \sum_{n\in [a,b]} \Lambda(n)$
and $\Psi(x) = \Psi([1,x])$, where $\Lambda$ is the von Mangoldt function. Note that this last equation
(sum over $\ell$) is stronger than one would get using a strong form of the Prime Number Theorem and
also the Riemann Hypothesis, since the widths of the intervals are smaller than $e^{\frac{1}{2}
\sqrt{x}}$, making the Riemann Hypothesis estimate "trivial".
