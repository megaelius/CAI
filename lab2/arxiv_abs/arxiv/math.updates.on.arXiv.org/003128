In 1859 Riemann (1826-1866) published his only paper on number theory. In this eight-page paper
he obtained a formula for the number of primes less than or equal to a real number x, and revealed the
deep connection between the distribution of primes and the zeros of an analytic function now called
the Riemann Zeta Function. In the early 1930's two related unpublished results from 1859 were found
in Riemanns very rough notes by the great twentieth century mathematician and scholar, Carl Ludwig
Siegel (1896-1981). In his 1932 paper "Uber Riemanns Nachlass zur analytischen Zahlentheorie"("On
Riemann's Nachlass for Analytic Number Theory") Siegel presents these unpublished results and
gives derivations he found in Riemann's notes. The first is an asymptotic development, now called
the Riemann-Siegel formula, for efficiently computing values of the Riemann Zeta Function. The
second is a new integral representation of the zeta function. These results had not been rediscovered
seventy years after Riemann. Thus, in 1932 the importance of Siegel's paper was not only its contribution
to the history of mathematics, but also its contribution to current research. Hoping to get some
insight into how Siegel spotted and deciphered these gems among Riemann's fragmentary and disordered
personnel papers, we decided to look at the 1932 paper. We also wanted to learn how much of the paper
is original to Riemann and whether Siegel needed to fill any gaps. Although Siegel's paper is cited
whenever the Riemann-Siegel formula is discussed, we were unable the locate an English translation.
Despite our limited knowledge of the German language, we have produced a translation of the paper
as it appears in volume one of Siegel's collected works.
