In additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, chaos has been proved to be the optimal coherent
communication waveform in the sense of using very simple matched filter to maximize the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). Recently, Lyapunov exponent spectrum of the chaotic signals after being transmitted
through a wireless channel has been shown to be unaltered, paving the way for wireless communication
using chaos. In wireless communication systems, inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath
propagation is one of the main obstacles to achieve high bit transmission rate and low bit error rate
(BER). How to resist multipath effect is a fundamental problem in a chaos-based wireless communication
system (CWCS). In this paper, implementation of a CWCS is presented. It is built to transmit chaotic
signals generated by a hybrid dynamical system and then to filter the received signals by using the
corresponding matched filter to decrease the noise effect and to detect the binary information.
We find that the multipath effect can be effectively resisted by regrouping the return map of the
received signal and by setting the corresponding threshold based on the available information.
We show that the optimal threshold is a function of the channel parameters and of the transmitted
information symbols. Practically, the channel parameters are time-variant, and the future information
symbols are unavailable. In this case, a suboptimal threshold (SOT) is proposed, and the BER using
the SOT is derived analytically. Simulation results show that the CWCS achieves a remarkable competitive
performance even under inaccurate channel parameters.
