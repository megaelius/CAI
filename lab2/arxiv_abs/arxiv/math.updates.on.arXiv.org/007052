Given the many applications in the sciences, computing spectra of operators is arguably one of the
most investigated areas of computational mathematics. Recent progress reveals that, unlike the
finite-dimensional case, infinite-dimensional problems yield a highly intricate infinite classification
theory determining which spectral problems can be solved and with which types of algorithms. Classifying
spectral problems and providing optimal algorithms is uncharted territory in the foundations
of computational mathematics. This is very much related to Smale's comprehensive program on the
foundations of computational mathematics initiated in the 1980s, and many of the problems can only
be computed via several limits, a phenomenon shared with the foundations of polynomial root finding
with rational maps as proved by McMullen. This paper is the first of a two-part series establishing
the foundations of computational spectral theory through the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI)
hierarchy and has three purposes. First, we establish answers to many open questions on the existence
of algorithms. For example, we show that for a large class of partial differential operators, spectra
can be computed with error control from point sampling operator coefficients. Other results include
computing spectra of unbounded operators on graphs, the computational spectral gap problem, computing
spectral classification, and computing discrete spectra with multiplicities. Second, these
classifications determine which types of problems can be used in computer-assisted proofs. The
theory for this is virtually non-existent, and we provide some of the first results in this infinite
classification theory. Third, our proofs are constructive, yielding a library of new algorithms
that handle problems that before were out of reach. We show several examples on contemporary problems
in the physical sciences.
