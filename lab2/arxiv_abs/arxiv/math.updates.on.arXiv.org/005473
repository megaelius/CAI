We continue the study of separable elements in finite Weyl groups. These elements generalize the
well-studied class of separable permutations. We show that the multiplication map $W/U \times
U \to W$ is a length-additive bijection, or splitting, of the Weyl group $W$ when $U$ is an order ideal
in right weak order generated by a separable element; this generalizes a result for the symmetric
group, answering an open problem of Wei. For a generalized quotient of the symmetric group, we show
that this multiplication map is a bijection if and only if $U$ is an order ideal in right weak order
generated by a separable element, thereby classifying those generalized quotients which induce
splittings of the symmetric group, resolving a problem of Bj\"{o}rner and Wachs from 1988. We also
prove that this map is always surjective when $U$ is an order ideal in right weak order. Interpreting
these sets of permutations as linear extensions of 2-dimensional posets gives the first direct
combinatorial proof of an inequality due originally to Sidorenko in 1991, answering an open problem
Morales, Pak, and Panova. We also prove a new $q$-analog of Sidorenko's formula. All of these results
are conjectured to extend to arbitrary finite Weyl groups. Finally, we show that separable elements
in $W$ are in bijection with the faces of all dimensions of several copies of the graph associahedron
of the Dynkin diagram of $W$. This correspondence associates to each separable element $w$ a certain
nested set; we give product formulas for the rank generating functions of the principal upper and
lower order ideals generated by $w$ in terms of these nested sets, generalizing several known formulas.
