Various approaches to studying the stability of solutions of nonlinear PDEs lead to explicit formulae
determining the stability or instability of the wave for a wide range of classes of equations. However,
these are typically specialized to a particular equation and checking the stability conditions
may not be not straightforward. We present results for a large class of problems that reduce the determination
of spectral stability of a wave to a simple task of locating zeros of explicitly constructed polynomials.
We study spectral stability of small-amplitude periodic waves in scalar Hamiltonian problems
as a perturbation of the zero-amplitude case. A necessary condition for stability of the wave is
that the unperturbed spectrum is restricted to the imaginary axis. Instability can come about through
a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation, i.e., of a collision of purely imaginary eigenvalues of the Floquet
spectrum of opposite Krein signature. In recent work on the stability of small-amplitude waves
the dispersion relation of the unperturbed problem was shown to play a central role. We demonstrate
that the dispersion relation provides even more explicit information about wave stability: we
construct a polynomial of half the degree of the dispersion relation, and its roots directly characterize
not only collisions of eigenvalues at zero-amplitude but also an agreement or a disagreement of
their Krein signatures. Based on this explicit information it is possible to detect instabilities
of non-zero amplitude waves. In our analysis we stay away from the possible instabilities at the
origin of the spectral plane corresponding to modulation or Benjamin-Fair instability. Generalized
KdV and its higher-order analogues are used as illustrating examples.
