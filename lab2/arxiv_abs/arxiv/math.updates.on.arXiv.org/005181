In this paper, we introduce a distributed version of the classical stochastic Multi-Arm Bandit
(MAB) problem. Our setting consists of a large number of agents $n$ that collaboratively and simultaneously
solve the same instance of $K$ armed MAB to minimize the average cumulative regret over all agents.
The agents can communicate and collaborate among each other \emph{only} through a pairwise asynchronous
gossip based protocol that exchange a limited number of bits. In our model, agents at each point decide
on (i) which arm to play, (ii) whether to, and if so (iii) what and whom to communicate with. Agents
in our model are decentralized, namely their actions only depend on their observed history in the
past. We develop a novel algorithm in which agents, whenever they choose, communicate only arm-ids
and not samples, with another agent chosen uniformly and independently at random. The per-agent
regret scaling achieved by our algorithm is $O \left( \frac{\lceil\frac{K}{n}\rceil+\log(n)}{\Delta}
\log(T) + \frac{\log^3(n) \log \log(n)}{\Delta^2} \right)$. Furthermore, any agent in our algorithm
communicates only a total of $\Theta(\log(T))$ times over a time interval of $T$. We compare our
results to two benchmarks - one where there is no communication among agents and one corresponding
to complete interaction. We show both theoretically and empirically, that our algorithm experiences
a significant reduction both in per-agent regret when compared to the case when agents do not collaborate
and in communication complexity when compared to the full interaction setting which requires $T$
communication attempts by an agent over $T$ arm pulls.
