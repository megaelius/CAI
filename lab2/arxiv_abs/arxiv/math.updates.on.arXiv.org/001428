In this paper, we develop fast procedures for solving linear systems arising from discretization
of ordinary and partial differential equations with Caputo fractional derivative w.r.t time variable.
First, we consider a finite difference scheme to solve a two-sided fractional ordinary equation.
Furthermore, we present a fast solution technique to accelerate Toeplitz matrix-vector multiplications
arising from finite difference discretization. This fast solution technique is based on a fast
Fourier transform and depends on the special structure of coefficient matrices, and it helps to
reduce the computational work from $O(N^{3})$ required by traditional methods to $O(Nlog^{2}N)$
and the memory requirement from $O(N^{2})$ to $O(N)$ without using any lossy compression, where
$N$ is the number of unknowns. Two finite difference schemes to solve time fractional hyperbolic
equations with different fractional order $\gamma$ are considered. We present a fast solution
technique depending on the special structure of coefficient matrices by rearranging the order
of unknowns. It helps to reduce the computational work from $O(N^2M)$ required by traditional methods
to $O(N$log$^{2}N)$ and the memory requirement from $O(NM)$ to $O(N)$ without using any lossy compression,
where $N=\tau^{-1}$ and $\tau$ is the size of time step, $M=h^{-1}$ and $h$ is the size of space step.
Importantly, a fast method is employed to solve the classical time fractional diffusion equation
with a lower coast at $O(MN$log$^2N)$, where the direct method requires an overall computational
complexity of $O(N^2M)$. Moreover, the applicability and accuracy of the scheme are demonstrated
by numerical experiments to support our theoretical analysis.
