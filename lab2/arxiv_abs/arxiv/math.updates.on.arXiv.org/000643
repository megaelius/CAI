We prove an incidence theorem for points and planes in $PG(3,F)$, valid, in particular, over the
finite field $F_q$ of odd characteristic $p$. An incidence is viewed as an intersection of a pair
of different type two-planes in the Klein quadric and then restricted to a sub-quadric by fixing
one variable. This associates with every incidence problem between points and planes in $F^3$ a
line-line incidence problem in $G={\rm SL}_2(F)$ and conversely. The latter problem is easier
than a line-line incidence problem in $F^3$, because the space of lines in $G$ is three-dimensional,
and can be solved by an algebraic application of the polynomial method. We show that the number of
incidences between $m$ points and $n$ planes in $PG(3,F)$, where $F$ can be $R,C$, or $F_q$, is $$O\left((mn)^{\frac{3}{4}}
+ (m+n)k\right),$$ where $k$ denotes the maximum number of collinear points or planes. There is
a natural restriction in the finite field case that $m,n=O(p^2)$. The upper bound is followed by
an example, with $m=n$, showing that it is tight, without additional assumptions. The paper ends
with some applications of the estimate, proving new results over $F_q$, somewhat analogous to those
attainable over $R$ via the Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem. For a non-collinear point set $S\subseteq
F_q^2$, the number of distinct vector products generated by $S$ is $\Omega\left[\min\left(|S|^{\frac{2}{3}},p\right)\right]$.
For any $A\subseteq F_q$, $$ |AA\pm AA|= \Omega \left[\min\left(|A|^{\frac{3}{2}},p\right)\right].
$$ We also prove a new bound for the Erd\"os distance problem in $F_q^3$: a set $S\subseteq F_q^3$,
not supported on a single isotropic line, contains a point, from which $\Omega\left[\min\left(|S|^{\frac{1}{2}},p\right)\right]$
distinct distances are realised. In general, this is the best possible if one allows $S$ to be contained
a plane in $F_q^3$.
