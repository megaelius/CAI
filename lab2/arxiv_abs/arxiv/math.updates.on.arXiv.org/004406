We introduce a class of separable sample covariance matrices of the form $\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}}_1:=\widetilde
A^{1/2} X \widetilde B X^* \widetilde A^{1/2}.$ Here $\widetilde{A}$ and $\widetilde{B}$ are
positive definite matrices whose spectrums consist of bulk spectrums plus several spikes, i.e.
larger eigenvalues that are separated from the bulks. Conceptually, we call $\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}}_1$
a \emph{spiked separable covariance matrix model}. On the one hand, this model includes the spiked
covariance matrix as a special case with $\widetilde{B}=I$. On the other hand, it allows for more
general correlations of datasets. In particular, for spatio-temporal dataset, $\widetilde{A}$
and $\widetilde{B}$ represent the spatial and temporal correlations, respectively. In this paper,
we investigate the principal components of spiked separable covariance matrices, i.e., the outlier
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}}_1$. We derive precise large deviation
estimates on the outlier eigenvalues, and on the generalized components (i.e. $\langle \mathbf{v},
\widetilde{\mathbf{\xi}}_i\rangle$ for any deterministic vector $\mathbf{v}$) of the outlier
and non-outlier eigenvectors $\widetilde{\mathbf{\xi}_i}$. We prove the results in full generality,
in the sense that our results also hold near the so-called BBP transition and for degenerate outliers.
Our results highlight both the similarity and difference between the spiked separable covariance
matrix model and the spiked covariance model. In particular, we show that the spikes of both $\widetilde{A}$
and $\widetilde{B}$ will cause outliers of the eigenvalue spectrum, and the eigenvectors can help
us to select the outliers that correspond to the spikes of $\widetilde{A}$ (or $\widetilde{B}$).
