The generalized diffusion equations with fractional order derivatives have shown be quite efficient
to describe the diffusion in complex systems, with the advantage of producing exact expressions
for the underlying diffusive properties. Recently, researchers have proposed different fractional-time
operators (namely: the Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu) which, differently from the well-known
Riemann-Liouville operator, are defined by non-singular memory kernels. Here we proposed to use
these new operators to generalize the usual diffusion equation. By analyzing the corresponding
fractional diffusion equations within the continuous time random walk framework, we obtained
waiting time distributions characterized by exponential, stretched exponential, and power-law
functions, as well as a crossover between two behaviors. For the mean square displacement, we found
crossovers between usual and confined diffusion, and between usual and sub-diffusion. We obtained
the exact expressions for the probability distributions, where non-Gaussian and stationary distributions
emerged. This former feature is remarkable because the fractional diffusion equation is solved
without external forces and subjected to the free diffusion boundary conditions. We have further
shown that these new fractional diffusion equations are related to diffusive processes with stochastic
resetting, and to fractional diffusion equations with derivatives of distributed order. Thus,
our results show that these new operators are a simple and efficient way for incorporating different
structural aspects into the system, opening new possibilities for modeling and investigating
anomalous diffusive processes.
