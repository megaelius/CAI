Over the last few years a wide array of random graph models have been postulated to understand properties
of empirically observed networks. Most of these models come with a parameter $t$ (usually related
to edge density) and a (model dependent) critical time $t_c$ which specifies when a giant component
emerges. There is evidence to support that for a wide class of models, under moment conditions, the
nature of this emergence is universal and looks like the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph,
in the sense of the critical scaling window and (a) the sizes of the components in this window (all
maximal component sizes scaling like $n^{2/3}$) and (b) the structure of components (rescaled
by $n^{-1/3}$) converge to random fractals related to the continuum random tree. Till date, (a)
has been proven for a number of models using different techniques while (b) has been proven for only
two models, the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph and the rank-1 inhomogeneous random
graph. The aim of this paper is to develop a general program for proving such results. The program
requires three main ingredients: (i) in the critical scaling window, components merge approximately
like the multiplicative coalescent (ii) scaling exponents of susceptibility functions are the
same as the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph and (iii) macroscopic averaging of expected distances
between random points in the same component in the barely subcritical regime. We show that these
apply to a number of fundamental random graph models including the configuration model, inhomogeneous
random graphs modulated via a finite kernel and bounded size rules. Thus these models all belong
to the domain of attraction of the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. As a by product we also
get results for component sizes at criticality for a general class of inhomogeneous random graphs.
