Given devices space $D$, an intensity measure $\lambda m\in(0,\infty)$, a transition kernel $Q$
from the space $D$ to positive real numbers $(0,\infty,$ a path-loss function (which depends on
the Euclidean distance between the devices and a positive constant $\alpha$), we define a Marked
Poisson Point process (MPPP). For a given MPPP and technical constants $\tau_{\lambda},\gamma_{\lambda}:(0,\,\infty)\to
(0,\infty),$ we define a Marked Signal-to- Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) graph, and associate
with it two empirical measures; the \emph{empirical marked measure} and the \emph{empirical connectivity
measure}. For a class of marked SINR graphs, we prove a joint \emph{ large deviation principle}(LDP)
for these empirical measures, with speed $\lambda$ in the $\tau$-topology. From the joint large
deviation principle for the empirical marked measure and the empirical connectivity measure,
we obtain an Asymptotic Equipartition Property(AEP) for network structured data modelled as a
marked SINR graph. Specifically, we show that for large dense marked SINR graph one require approximately
about $\lambda^{2}H(Q\times Q)/\log 2$ bits to transmit the information contained in the network
with high probability, where $ H(Q\times Q)$ is a properly defined entropy for the exponential transition
kernel with parameter $c$. Further, we prove a \emph {local large deviation principle} (LLDP) for
the class of marked SINR graphs on $D,$ where $\lambda[\tau_{\lambda}(a)\gamma_{\lambda}(a)+\lambda\tau_{\lambda}(b)\gamma_{\lambda}(b)]\to
\beta(a,b),$ $ a,b\in (0,\infty)$, with speed $\lambda$ from a \emph{ spectral potential} point.
From the LLDP we derive a conditional LDP for the marked SINR graphs.
