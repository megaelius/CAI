What is the scaling limit of diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) in the plane? This is an old and famously
difficult question. One can generalize the question in two ways: first, one may consider the {\em
dielectric breakdown model} $\eta$-DBM, a generalization of DLA in which particle locations are
sampled from the $\eta$-th power of harmonic measure, instead of harmonic measure itself. Second,
instead of restricting attention to deterministic lattices, one may consider $\eta$-DBM on random
graphs known or believed to converge in law to a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface with parameter
$\gamma \in [0,2]$. In this generality, we propose a scaling limit candidate called quantum Loewner
evolution, QLE$(\gamma^2, \eta)$. QLE is defined in terms of the radial Loewner equation like radial
SLE, except that it is driven by a measure valued diffusion $\nu_t$ derived from LQG rather than a
multiple of a standard Brownian motion. We formalize the dynamics of $\nu_t$ using an SPDE. For each
$\gamma \in (0,2]$, there are two or three special values of $\eta$ for which we establish the existence
of a solution to these dynamics and explicitly describe the stationary law of $\nu_t$. We also explain
discrete versions of our construction that relate DLA to loop-erased random walk and the Eden model
to percolation. A certain "reshuffling" trick (in which concentric annular regions are rotated
randomly, like slot machine reels) facilitates explicit calculation. We propose QLE$(2,1)$ as
a scaling limit for DLA on a random spanning-tree-decorated planar map, and QLE$(8/3,0)$ as a scaling
limit for the Eden model on a random triangulation. We propose using QLE$(8/3,0)$ to endow pure LQG
with a distance function, by interpreting the region explored by a branching variant of QLE$(8/3,0)$,
up to a fixed time, as a metric ball in a random metric space.
