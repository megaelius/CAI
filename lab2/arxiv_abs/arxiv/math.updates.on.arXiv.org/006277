In late December 2019, a novel strand of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing a severe, potentially
fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and is causing
outbreaks in multiple world countries, soon becoming a pandemic. Italy has now become the most hit
country outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a total of 27980
confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging
infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic
in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a
new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they
have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and
non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection
than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of
the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. Being able to predict the
amount of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease
frequently requires hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges
the healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the
new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment. Simulation results are
compared with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare
different possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.
