We prove a constructive stable ODE-type blowup result for open sets of solutions to a family of quasilinear
wave equations in three spatial dimensions featuring a Riccati-type derivative-quadratic semilinear
term. The singularity is more severe than a shock in that the solution itself blows up like the log
of the distance to the blowup-time. We assume that the quasilinear terms satisfy certain structural
assumptions, which in particular ensure that the "elliptic part" of the wave operator vanishes
precisely at the singular points. The initial data are compactly supported and can be small or large
in $L^{\infty}$, but the spatial derivatives must initially satisfy a nonlinear smallness condition
compared to the time derivative. The first main idea of the proof is to construct a quasilinear integrating
factor, which allows us to reformulate the wave equation as a system whose solutions remain regular,
all the way up to the singularity. This is equivalent to constructing quasilinear vectorfields
adapted to the nonlinear flow. The second main idea is to exploit some crucial monotonic terms in
various estimates, especially the energy estimates, that feature the integrating factor. The
availability of the monotonicity is tied to our assumptions on the data and on the structure of the
quasilinear terms. The third main idea is to propagate the relative smallness of the spatial derivatives
all the way up to the singularity so that the solution behaves, in many ways, like an ODE solution.
As a corollary of our main results, we show that there are quasilinear wave equations that exhibit
two distinct kinds of blowup: the formation of shocks for one non-trivial set of data, and ODE-type
blowup for another non-trivial set.
