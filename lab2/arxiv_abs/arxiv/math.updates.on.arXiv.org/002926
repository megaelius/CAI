We consider several problems related to the restriction of $(\nabla^k) \hat{f}$ to a surface $\Sigma
\subset \mathbb R^d$ with nonvanishing Gauss curvature. While such restrictions clearly exist
if $f$ is a Schwartz function, there are few bounds available that enable one to take limits with respect
to the $L_p(\mathbb R^d)$ norm of $f$. We establish three scenarios where it is possible to do so:
$\bullet$ When the restriction is measured according to a Sobolev space $H^{-s}(\Sigma)$ of negative
index. We determine the complete range of indices $(k, s, p)$ for which such a bound exists. $\bullet$
Among functions where $\hat{f}$ vanishes on $\Sigma$ to order $k-1$, the restriction of $(\nabla^k)
\hat{f}$ defines a bounded operator from (this subspace of) $L_p(\mathbb R^d)$ to $L_2(\Sigma)$
provided $1 \leq p \leq \frac{2d+2}{d+3+4k}$. $\bullet$ When there is _a priori_ control of $\hat{f}|_\Sigma$
in a space $H^{\ell}(\Sigma)$, $\ell > 0$, this implies improved regularity for the restrictions
of $(\nabla^k)\hat{f}$. If $\ell$ is large enough then even $\|\nabla \hat{f}\|_{L_2(\Sigma)}$
can be controlled in terms of $\|\hat{f}\|_{H^\ell(\Sigma)}$ and $\|f\|_{L_p(\mathbb R^d)}$
alone. The techniques underlying these results are inspired by the spectral synthesis work of Y.
Domar, which provides a mechanism for $L_p$ approximation by "convolving along surfaces", and
the Stein-Tomas restriction theorem. Our main inequality is a bilinear form bound with similar
structure to the Stein--Tomas $T^*T$ operator, generalized to accommodate smoothing along $\Sigma$
and derivatives transverse to it. It is used both to establish basic $H^{-s}(\Sigma)$ bounds for
derivatives of $\hat{f}$ and to bootstrap from surface regularity of $\hat{f}$ to regularity of
its higher derivatives.
