Coding and testing schemes for binary hypothesis testing over noisy networks are proposed and their
corresponding type-II error exponents are derived. When communication is over a discrete memoryless
channel (DMC), our scheme combines Shimokawa-Han-Amari's hypothesis testing scheme with Borade's
unequal error protection (UEP) for channel coding. A separate source channel coding architecture
is employed. The resulting exponent is optimal for the newly introduced class of \emph{generalized
testing against conditional independence}. When communication is over a MAC or a BC, our scheme
combines hybrid coding with UEP. The resulting error exponent over the MAC is optimal in the case
of generalized testing against conditional independence with independent observations at the
two sensors, when the MAC decomposes into two individual DMCs. In this case, separate source-channel
coding is sufficient; this same conclusion holds also under arbitrarily correlated sensor observations
when testing is against independence. For the BC, the error exponents region of hybrid coding with
UEP exhibits a tradeoff between the exponents attained at the two decision centers. When both receivers
aim at maximizing the error exponents under different hypotheses and the marginal distributions
of the sensors' observations are different under these hypotheses, then this tradeoff can be mitigated
with the following strategy. The sensor makes a tentative guess on the hypothesis, submits this
guess, and applies our coding and testing scheme for the DMC only for the decision center that is not
interested in maximizing the exponent under the guessed hypothesis.
