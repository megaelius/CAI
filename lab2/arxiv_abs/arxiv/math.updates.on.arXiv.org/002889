A linear time-invariant dissipative Hamiltonian (DH) system x' = (J-R)Q x, with a skew-Hermitian
J, an Hermitian positive semi-definite R, and an Hermitian positive definite Q, is always Lyapunov
stable and under weak further conditions even asymptotically stable. In various applications
there is uncertainty on the system matrices J, R, Q, and it is desirable to know whether the system
remains asymptotically stable uniformly against all possible uncertainties within a given perturbation
set. Such robust stability considerations motivate the concept of stability radius for DH systems,
i.e., what is the maximal perturbation permissible to the coefficients J, R, Q, while preserving
the asymptotic stability. We consider two stability radii, the unstructured one where J, R, Q are
subject to unstructured perturbation, and the structured one where the perturbations preserve
the DH structure. We employ characterizations for these radii that have been derived recently in
[SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 37, pp. 1625-1654, 2016] and propose new algorithms to compute these
stability radii for large scale problems by tailoring subspace frameworks that are interpolatory
and guaranteed to converge at a super-linear rate in theory. At every iteration, they first solve
a reduced problem and then expand the subspaces in order to attain certain Hermite interpolation
properties between the full and reduced problems. The reduced problems are solved by means of the
adaptations of existing level-set algorithms for H-infinity norm computation in the unstructured
case, while, for the structured radii, we benefit from algorithms that approximate the objective
eigenvalue function with a piece-wise quadratic global underestimator. The performance of the
new approaches is illustrated with several examples including a system that arises from a finite-element
modeling of an industrial disk brake.
