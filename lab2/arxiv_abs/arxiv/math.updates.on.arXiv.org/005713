Distribution and distillation of entanglement over quantum networks is a basic task for Quantum
Internet applications. A fundamental question is then to determine the ultimate performance of
entanglement distribution over a given network. Although this question has been extensively explored
for bipartite entanglement-distribution scenarios, less is known about multipartite entanglement
distribution. Here we establish the fundamental limit of distributing multipartite entanglement,
in the form of GHZ states, over a quantum network. In particular, we determine the multipartite entanglement
distribution capacity of a quantum network, in which the nodes are connected through lossy bosonic
quantum channels. This setting corresponds to a practical quantum network consisting of optical
links. The result is also applicable to the distribution of multipartite secret key, known as common
key, for both a fully quantum network and trusted-node based quantum key distribution network.
Our results set a general benchmark for designing a network topology and network quantum repeaters
(or key relay in trusted nodes) to realize efficient GHZ state/common key distribution in both fully
quantum and trusted-node-based networks. We show an example of how to overcome this limit by introducing
a network quantum repeater. Our result follows from an upper bound on distillable GHZ entanglement
introduced here, called the "recursive-cut-and-merge" bound, which constitutes major progress
on a longstanding fundamental problem in multipartite entanglement theory. This bound allows
for determining the distillable GHZ entanglement for a class of states consisting of products of
bipartite pure states.
