Shamir's celebrated secret sharing scheme provides an efficient method for encoding a secret of
arbitrary length $\ell$ among any $N \leq 2^\ell$ players such that for a threshold parameter $t$,
(i) the knowledge of any $t$ shares does not reveal any information about the secret and, (ii) any
choice of $t+1$ shares fully reveals the secret. It is known that any such threshold secret sharing
scheme necessarily requires shares of length $\ell$, and in this sense Shamir's scheme is optimal.
The more general notion of ramp schemes requires the reconstruction of secret from any $t+g$ shares,
for a positive integer gap parameter $g$. Ramp secret sharing scheme necessarily requires shares
of length $\ell/g$. Other than the bound related to secret length $\ell$, the share lengths of ramp
schemes can not go below a quantity that depends only on the gap ratio $g/N$. In this work, we study
secret sharing in the extremal case of bit-long shares and arbitrarily small gap ratio $g/N$, where
standard ramp secret sharing becomes impossible. We show, however, that a slightly relaxed but
equally effective notion of semantic security for the secret, and negligible reconstruction error
probability, eliminate the impossibility. Moreover, we provide explicit constructions of such
schemes. One of the consequences of our relaxation is that, unlike standard ramp schemes with perfect
secrecy, adaptive and non-adaptive adversaries need different analysis and construction. For
non-adaptive adversaries, we explicitly construct secret sharing schemes that provide secrecy
against any $\tau$ fraction of observed shares, and reconstruction from any $\rho$ fraction of
shares, for any choices of $0 \leq \tau < \rho \leq 1$. Our construction achieves secret length $N(\rho-\tau-o(1))$,
which we show to be optimal. For adaptive adversaries, we construct explicit schemes attaining
a secret length $\Omega(N(\rho-\tau))$.
