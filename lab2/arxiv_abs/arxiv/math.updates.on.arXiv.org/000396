Base station (BS) sleeping has emerged as a viable solution to enhance the overall network energy
efficiency by inactivating the underutilized BSs. However, it affects the performance of users
in sleeping cells depending on their BS association criteria, their channel conditions towards
the active BSs, and scheduling criteria and traffic loads at the active BSs. This paper characterizes
the performance of cellular systems with BS sleeping by developing a systematic framework to derive
the spectral efficiency and outage probability of downlink transmission to the sleeping cell users
taking into account the aforementioned factors. In this context, we develop a user association
scheme in which a typical user in a sleeping cell selects a BS with \textbf{M}aximum best-case \textbf{M}ean
channel \textbf{A}ccess \textbf{P}robability (MMAP) which is calculated by all active BSs based
on their existing traffic loads. We consider both greedy and round-robin schemes at active BSs for
scheduling users in a channel. Once the association is performed, the exact access probability
for a typical sleeping cell user and the statistics of its received signal and interference powers
are derived to evaluate the spectral and energy efficiencies of transmission. For the sleeping
cell users, we also consider the conventional \textbf{M}aximum \textbf{R}eceived \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{P}ower (MRSP)-based user association scheme along with greedy and round-robin schemes
at the BSs. The impact of cell-zooming is incorporated in the derivations to analyze its feasibility
in reducing the coverage holes created by BS sleeping. Numerical results show the trade-offs between
spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in various network scenarios. The accuracy of the analysis
is verified through Monte-Carlo simulations.
