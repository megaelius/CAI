This work proposes a nonlinear stochastic filter evolved on the Special Orthogonal Group SO(3)
as a solution to the attitude filtering problem. One of the most common potential functions for nonlinear
deterministic attitude observers is studied and reformulated to address the noise attached to
the attitude dynamics. The resultant estimator and correction factor demonstrate convergence
properties and remarkable ability to attenuate the noise. The stochastic dynamics of the attitude
problem are mapped from SO(3) to Rodriguez vector. The proposed stochastic filter evolved on SO(3)
guarantees that errors in the Rodriguez vector and estimates steer very close to the neighborhood
of the origin and that the errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in mean square.
Simulation results illustrate the robustness of the proposed filter in the presence of high uncertainties
in measurements. Keywords: Attitude, estimate, estimator, observer, filter, stochastic differential
