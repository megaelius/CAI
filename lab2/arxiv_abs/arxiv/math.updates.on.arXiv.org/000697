String and particle excitations are examined in a class of 3+1D topological order described by a
discrete gauge theory with a gauge group $G$ and a 4-cocycle twist $\omega_4 \in \mathcal{H}^4(G,\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$
of $G$'s cohomology group. We demonstrate the topological spin and the spin-statistics relation
for the closed strings, and their multi-string braiding. The 3+1D twisted gauge theory can be characterized
by a representation of SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$ modular transformation, which we find its generators
$\mathsf{S}^{xyz}$ and $\mathsf{T}^{xy}$ in terms of the gauge group $G$ and the 4-cocycle $\omega_4$.
As we compactify one of the 3D's direction $z$ into a compact circle inserted with a gauge flux $b$,
we can use the generators of SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ subgroup of SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$, $\mathsf{S}^{xy}$
and $\mathsf{T}^{xy}$, to study the dimension reduction of the 3D topological order $\mathcal{C}^{3\text{D}}$
to a direct sum of degenerate states of 2D topological orders $\mathcal{C}_b^{2\text{D}}$ in different
flux $b$ sectors: $\mathcal{C}^{3\text{D}} = \oplus_b \mathcal{C}_b^{2\text{D}}$. The 2D topological
orders $\mathcal{C}_b^{2\text{D}}$ are described by 2D gauge theories of the group $G$ twisted
by the 3-cocycles $\omega_{3(b)}$ dimensionally reduced from the 4-cocycle $\omega_4$. We show
that the SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ generators, $\mathsf{S}^{xy}$ and $\mathsf{T}^{xy}$, fully encodes
a particular type of three-string braiding statistics for the connected sum of two Hopf links $2^2_1
\# 2^2_1$ configuration. With certain 4-cocycle twist, we find that, by threading a third string
through two-string unlink $0^2_1$ into three-string Hopf links $2^2_1 \# 2^2_1$ configuration,
Abelian two-string statistics is promoted to non-Abelian three-string statistics.
