Benson's outer approximation algorithm and its variants are the most frequently used methods for
solving linear multiobjective optimization problems. These algorithms have two intertwined
components: one-dimensional linear optimization one one hand, and a combinatorial part closely
related to vertex numeration on the other. Their separation provides a deeper insight into Benson's
algorithm, and points toward a dual approach. Two skeletal algorithms are defined which focus on
the combinatorial part. Using different single-objective optimization problems - called oracle
calls - yield different algorithms, such as a sequential convex hull algorithm, another version
of Benson's algorithm with the theoretically best possible iteration count, the dual algorithm
of Ehrgott, L\"ohne and Shao, and the new algorithm. The new algorithm has several advantages. First,
the corresponding one-dimensional optimization problem uses the original constraints without
adding any extra variables or constraints. Second, its iteration count meets the theoretically
best possible one. As a dual algorithm, it is sequential: in each iteration it produces an extremal
solution, thus can be aborted when a satisfactory solution is found. The Pareto front can be "probed"
or "scanned" from several directions at any moment without adversely affecting the efficiency.
Finally, it is well suited to handle highly degenerate problems where there are many linear dependencies
among the constraints. On problems with ten or more objectives the implementation shows a significant
increase in efficiency compared to Bensolve - due to the reduced number of iterations and the improved
combinatorial handling.
