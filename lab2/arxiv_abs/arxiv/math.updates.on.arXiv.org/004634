Random microstructures of heterogeneous materials play a crucial role in the material macroscopic
behavior and in predictions of its effective properties. A common approach to modeling random multiphase
materials is to develop so-called surrogate models approximating statistical features of the
material. However, the surrogate models used in fatigue analysis usually employ simple microstructure,
consisting of ideal geometries such as ellipsoidal inclusions, which generally does not capture
complex geometries. In this paper, we introduce a simple but flexible surrogate microstructure
model for two-phase materials through a level-cut of a Gaussian random field with covariance of
Mat\'ern class. Such parametrization of the covariance function allows for the representation
of a few key design parameters while representing the geometry of inclusions in a more general setting
for a large class of random heterogeneous two-phase media. In addition to the traditional morphology
descriptors such as porosity, size and aspect ratio, it provides control of the regularity of the
inclusions interface and sphericity. These parameters are estimated from a small number of real
material images using Bayesian inversion. An efficient process of evaluating the samples, based
on the Fast Fourier Transform, makes possible the use of Monte-Carlo methods to estimate statistical
properties for the quantities of interest in a given material class. We demonstrate the overall
framework of the use of the surrogate material model in application to the uncertainty quantification
in fatigue analysis, its feasibility and efficiency, and its role in the microstructure design.
