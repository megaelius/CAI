In this paper, we analytically study the bit error rate (BER) performance of underwater visible
light communication (UVLC) systems with binary pulse position modulation (BPPM). We simulate
the channel fading-free impulse response (FFIR) based on Monte Carlo numerical method to take into
account the absorption and scattering effects. Additionally, to characterize turbulence effects,
we multiply the aforementioned FFIR by a fading coefficient which for weak oceanic turbulence can
be modeled as a lognormal random variable (RV). Moreover, to mitigate turbulence effects, we employ
multiple transmitters and/or receivers, i.e., spatial diversity technique over UVLC links. Closed-form
expressions for the system BER are provided, when equal gain combiner (EGC) is employed at the receiver
side, thanks to Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula and approximation to the sum of lognormal RVs.
We further apply saddle-point approximation, an accurate photon-counting-based method, to evaluate
the system BER in the presence of shot noise. Both laser-based collimated and light emitting diode
(LED)-based diffusive links are investigated. Since multiple-scattering effect of UVLC channels
on the propagating photons causes considerable inter-symbol interference (ISI), especially
for diffusive channels, we also obtain the optimum multiple-symbol detection (MSD) algorithm
to significantly alleviate ISI effects and improve the system performance. Our numerical analysis
indicates good matches between the analytical and photon-counting results implying the negligibility
of signal-dependent shot noise, and also between analytical results and numerical simulations
confirming the accuracy of our derived closed-form expressions for the system BER. Besides, our
results show that spatial diversity significantly mitigates fading impairments while MSD considerably
alleviates ISI deteriorations.
