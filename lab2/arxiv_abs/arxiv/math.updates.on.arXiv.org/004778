Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) claims over 400,000 lives each year in North America and
is one of the most time-sensitive medical emergencies. Drone-delivered automated external defibrillators
(AEDs) have the potential to be a transformative innovation in the provision of emergency care for
OHCA. In this paper, we propose a simulation-optimization framework to minimize the total number
of drones required to meet a pre-specified response time goal, while guaranteeing a sufficient
number of drones are located at each base. To do this, we develop a location-queuing model that is
based on the p-median architecture, where each base constitutes an explicit M/M/d queue, and that
incorporates estimated baseline response times to the demand points. We then develop a reformulation
technique that exploits the baseline response times, allowing us to solve real-world instances
to optimality using an off-the-shelf solver. To test our model, we develop a two-stage machine learning
approach to simulate both the locations and baseline response times for future OHCAs. We demonstrate
the application of our framework using eight years of real data from an area covering 26,000 square
kilometres around Toronto, Canada. A modest number of drones are required to significantly reduce
response times in all regions. Furthermore, an objective function focused on improving the 90th
percentile is well-suited for use in practice because the model reduces the entire response time
distribution, while providing equitable coverage in both cities and rural areas. Overall, this
paper provides a realistic framework that can be leveraged by healthcare providers seeking to implement
a drone network.
