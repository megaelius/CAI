We propose and compare methods for the estimation of extreme event probabilities in complex systems
governed by PDEs. Our approach is guided by ideas from large deviation theory (LDT) and borrows tools
from PDE-constrained optimization. The systems under consideration involve random parameters
and we are interested in quantifying the probability that a scalar function of the system state solution
is at or above a threshold. If this threshold is large, these probabilities are small and their accurate
estimation is challenging. Our methods first compute parameters that minimize the LDT-rate function
over the set of parameters leading to extreme events. These solutions provide asymptotic information
about small probability events. We propose a series of methods to refine these estimates, namely
methods based on importance sampling and on geometric approximation of the extreme event sets.
Results are formulated for general parameter distributions and detailed expressions are provided
when the underlying distribution is Gaussian. We give theoretical and numerical arguments showing
that the performance of our methods is insensitive to the extremeness of the events we are interested
in. We illustrate the application of our approach to quantify the probability of extreme tsunami
events on shore. Tsunamis are typically caused by a sudden, unpredictable change of the ocean floor
elevation during an earthquake. We model this change as a random process, which takes into account
the underlying physics. We use the one-dimensional shallow water equation to model tsunamis numerically.
Adjoint methods are used to compute the derivatives needed to solve the LDT-optimization problem.
We present a comparison of the methods for extreme event probability estimation, and find which
type of ocean floor elevation change leads to the largest tsunamis on shore.
