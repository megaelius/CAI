The well-known Caputo fractional derivative and the corresponding Caputo fractional integral
occur naturally in many equations that model physical phenomena under inhomogeneous media. The
relationship between the two fractional terms can be readily obtained by applying the Laplace transform
to a given equation. We seek to numerically approximate Caputo fractional integrals using a Taylor
series expansion for convolution integrals. This naturally extends into being able to approximate
convolution integrals for a wider class of convolution integral kernels $K(t-s)$. One of the main
advantages under this approach is the ability to numerically approximate weakly singular kernels,
which fail to converge under traditional quadrature methods. We provide stability and convergence
analysis for these composite quadratures, which offer optimal convergence for approximating
functions in $C^{\gamma}[0,T]$, where $\alpha \leq \gamma \leq 5$ and $0<\alpha < 1$. For the order
$\gamma = 1,2,3,4,5$ scheme, the resulting approximation is $O(\tau^{\gamma})$ accurate, where
$\tau$ is the size of the partition of the time domain. By instead utilizing a fractional Taylor series
expansion, we are able to obtain for $\gamma \in (0,5)-\{1,2,3,4\}$ order scheme, which yields
an approximation of $O(\tau^{\gamma})$ with a constant dependent on the kernel function which
improves the order of convergence. This allows for a far wider class of functions to be approximated,
and by strengthening the regularity assumption, we are able to obtain more accurate results. General
convolution integrals exhibit these results up to $\gamma = 2$ without the assumption of $K$ being
decreasing. Finally, some numerical examples are presented, which validate our findings.
