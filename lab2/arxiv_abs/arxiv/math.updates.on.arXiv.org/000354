Let G be a discrete group acting by an exact action on a separable C*-algebra A. It is shown that the
reduced crossed product Ax_r G is strongly purely infinite - provided that the action of G on any quotient
A/I by a G-invariant closed ideal I not equal to A is element-wise properly outer and that the action
of G on A is G-separating (see Definition 2.5). It is a first non-trivial sufficient criterium for
strong pure infiniteness of reduced crossed products in case of C*-algebras A that are not G-simple.
In the case A=C_0(X) the notion of a G-separating action corresponds to the property that two compact
sets C_1 and C_2, that are contained in open subsets U_1 and U_2 of X, can be mapped by elements of g_j
in G onto disjoint sets \sigma(g_j)(C_j) of U_j, but we do not require that \sigma(g_j)(U_j) is contained
in U_j. A generalization of strong boundary actions on compact spaces to non-unital and non-commutative
C*-algebras A (see Definition 2.6) is stronger than G-separating actions by Proposition 7.5, because
G-separation does not imply G-simplicity and there are examples of G-separating actions with reduced
crossed products that are stably projection-less and non-simple. Our results yield a sufficient
criterium for the strong pure infiniteness of crossed products AxN by an endomorphism \varphi of
A (see Theorem 6.4). It implies that certain special nuclear Cuntz-Pimsner algebras are strongly
purely infinite, and thus absorb the O_\infty tensorially. The idea of G-separating actions and
non-commutative generalizations of strong boundary actions provide also alternative proofs
of some known results on simple purely infinite algebras.
