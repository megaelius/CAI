Stochastic models of reaction networks are becoming increasingly important in Systems Biology.
In these models, the dynamics is generally represented by a continuous-time Markov chain whose
states denote the copy-numbers of the constituent species. The state-space on which this process
resides is a subset of non-negative integer lattice and for many examples of interest, this state-space
is countably infinite. This causes numerous problems in analyzing the Markov chain and understanding
its long-term behavior. These problems are further confounded by the presence of conservation
relations among species which constrain the dynamics in complicated ways. In this paper we provide
a linear-algebraic procedure to disentangle these conservation relations and represent the state-space
in a special decomposed form, based on the copy-number ranges of various species and dependencies
among them. This decomposed form is advantageous for analyzing the stochastic model and for a large
class of networks we demonstrate how this form can be used for finding all the closed communication
classes for the Markov chain within the infinite state-space. Such communication classes are irreducible
state-spaces for the dynamics and they support all the extremal stationary distributions for the
Markov chain. Hence our results provide important insights into the long-term behavior and stability
properties of stochastic models of reaction networks. We discuss how the knowledge of these irreducible
state-spaces can be used in many ways such as speeding-up stochastic simulations of multiscale
networks or in identifying the stationary distributions of complex-balanced networks. We illustrate
our results with several examples of gene-expression networks from Systems Biology.
