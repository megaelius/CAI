A natural medium for wave propagation comprises a coupled bounded heterogeneous region and an unbounded
homogeneous free-space. Frequency-domain wave propagation models in the medium, such as the variable
coefficient Helmholtz equation, include a faraway decay radiation condition (RC). It is desirable
to develop algorithms that incorporate the full physics of the heterogeneous and unbounded medium
wave propagation model, and avoid an approximation of the RC. In this work we first present and analyze
an overlapping decomposition framework that is equivalent to the full-space heterogeneous-homogenous
continuous model, governed by the Helmholtz equation with a spatially dependent refractive index
and the RC. Our novel overlapping framework allows the user to choose two free boundaries, and gain
the advantage of applying established high-order finite and boundary element methods (FEM and
BEM) to simulate an equivalent coupled model. The coupled model comprises auxiliary interior bounded
heterogeneous and exterior unbounded homogeneous Helmholtz problems. A smooth boundary can be
chosen for simulating the exterior problem using a spectrally accurate BEM, and a simple boundary
can be used to setup a high-order FEM for the interior problem. Thanks to the spectral accuracy of
the exterior computational model, the resulting coupled system in the overlapping region is relatively
very small. Using the decomposed equivalent framework, we develop a novel overlapping FEM-BEM
algorithm for simulating the acoustic or electromagnetic wave propagation in two dimensions.
Our FEM-BEM algorithm for the full-space model incorporates the RC exactly. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the efficiency of the FEM-BEM approach for simulating smooth and non-smooth wave fields,
with the latter induced by a complex heterogeneous medium and a discontinuous refractive index.
