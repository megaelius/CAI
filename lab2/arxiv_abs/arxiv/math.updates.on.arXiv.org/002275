We prove a stable shock formation result for a large class of systems of quasilinear wave equations
in two spatial dimensions. We give a precise description of the dynamics all the way up to the singularity.
Our main theorem applies to systems of two wave equations featuring two distinct wave speeds and
various quasilinear and semilinear nonlinearities, while the solutions under study are (non-symmetric)
perturbations of simple outgoing plane symmetric waves. The two waves are allowed to interact all
the way up to the singularity. Our approach is robust and could be used to prove shock formation results
for other related systems with many unknowns and multiple speeds, in various solution regimes,
and in higher spatial dimensions. However, a fundamental aspect of our framework is that it applies
only to solutions in which the "fastest wave" forms a shock while the remaining solution variables
do not. Our approach is based on an extended version of the geometric vectorfield method developed
by D. Christodoulou in his study of shock formation for scalar wave equations as well as the framework
developed in our recent joint work with J. Luk, in which we proved a shock formation result for a quasilinear
wave-transport system featuring a single wave operator. A key new difficulty that we encounter
is that the geometric vectorfields that we use to commute the equations are, by necessity, adapted
to the wave operator of the (shock-forming) fast wave and therefore exhibit very poor commutation
properties with the slow wave operator, much worse than their commutation properties with a transport
operator. To overcome this difficulty, we rely on a first-order reformulation of the slow wave equation,
which, though somewhat limiting in the precision it affords, allows us to avoid uncontrollable
commutator terms.
