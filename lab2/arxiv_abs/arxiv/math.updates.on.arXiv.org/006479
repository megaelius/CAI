Given a bipartite graph with parts $A$ and $B$ having maximum degrees at most $\Delta_A$ and $\Delta_B$,
respectively, consider a list assignment such that every vertex in $A$ or $B$ is given a list of colours
of size $k_A$ or $k_B$, respectively. We prove some general sufficient conditions in terms of $\Delta_A$,
$\Delta_B$, $k_A$, $k_B$ to be guaranteed a proper colouring such that each vertex is coloured using
only a colour from its list. These are asymptotically nearly sharp in the very asymmetric cases.
We establish one sufficient condition in particular, where $\Delta_A=\Delta_B=\Delta$, $k_A=\log
\Delta$ and $k_B=(1+o(1))\Delta/\log\Delta$ as $\Delta\to\infty$. This amounts to partial
progress towards a conjecture from 1998 of Krivelevich and the first author. We also derive some
necessary conditions through an intriguing connection between the complete case and the extremal
size of approximate Steiner systems. We show that for complete bipartite graphs these conditions
are asymptotically nearly sharp in a large part of the parameter space. This has provoked the following.
In the setup above, we conjecture that a proper list colouring is always guaranteed * if $k_A \ge \Delta_A^\varepsilon$
and $k_B \ge \Delta_B^\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon>0$ provided $\Delta_A$ and $\Delta_B$
are large enough; * if $k_A \ge C \log\Delta_B$ and $k_B \ge C \log\Delta_A$ for some absolute constant
$C>1$; or * if $\Delta_A=\Delta_B = \Delta$ and $ k_B \ge C (\Delta/\log\Delta)^{1/k_A}\log \Delta$
for some absolute constant $C>0$. These are asymmetric generalisations of the above-mentioned
conjecture of Krivelevich and the first author, and if true are close to best possible. Our general
sufficient conditions provide partial progress towards these conjectures.
