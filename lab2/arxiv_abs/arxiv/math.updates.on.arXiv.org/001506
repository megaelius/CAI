A convolution algebra is a topological vector space $\mathcal{X}$ that is closed under the convolution
operation. It is said to be inverse-closed if each element of $\mathcal{X}$ whose spectrum is bounded
away from zero has a convolution inverse that is also part of the algebra. The theory of discrete Banach
convolution algebras is well established with a complete characterization of the weighted $\ell_1$
algebras that are inverse-closed and referred to as the Gelfand-Raikov-Shilov (GRS) spaces. Our
starting point here is the observation that the space $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ of rapidly
decreasing sequences, {which is not Banach but nuclear}, is an inverse-closed convolution algebra.
This property propagates to the more constrained space of exponentially decreasing sequences
$\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ that we prove to be nuclear as well. Using a recent extended version
of the GRS condition, we then show that $\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is actually the smallest inverse-closed
convolution algebra. This allows us to describe the hierarchy of the inverse-closed convolution
algebras from the smallest, $\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, to the largest, $\ell_{1}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$.
In addition, we prove that, in contrast to $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, all members of $\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$
admit well-defined convolution inverses in $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with the "unstable"
scenario (when some frequencies are vanishing) giving rise to inverse filters with slowly-increasing
impulse responses. Finally, we use those results to reveal the decay and reproduction properties
of an extended family of cardinal spline interpolants.
