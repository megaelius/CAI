Subdivision surfaces provide an elegant isogeometric analysis framework for geometric design
and analysis of partial differential equations defined on surfaces. They are already a standard
in high-end computer animation and graphics and are becoming available in a number of geometric
modelling systems for engineering design. The subdivision refinement rules are usually adapted
from knot insertion rules for splines. The quadrilateral Catmull-Clark scheme considered in this
work is equivalent to cubic B-splines away from extraordinary, or irregular, vertices with other
than four adjacent elements. Around extraordinary vertices the surface consists of a nested sequence
of smooth spline patches which join $C^1$ continuously at the point itself. As known from geometric
design literature, the subdivision weights can be optimised so that the surface quality is improved
by minimising short-wavelength surface oscillations around extraordinary vertices. We use the
related techniques to determine weights that minimise finite element discretisation errors as
measured in the thin-shell energy norm. The optimisation problem is formulated over a characteristic
domain and the errors in approximating cup- and saddle-like quadratic shapes obtained from eigenanalysis
of the subdivision matrix are minimised. In finite element analysis the optimised subdivision
weights for either cup- or saddle-like shapes are chosen depending on the shape of the solution field
around an extraordinary vertex. As our computations confirm, the optimised subdivision weights
yield a reduction of $50\%$ and more in discretisation errors in the energy and $L_2$ norms. Although,
as to be expected, the convergence rates are the same as for the classical Catmull-Clark weights,
the convergence constants are improved.
