A sparse matrix is called double irregular sparse if it has at least one relatively dense column and
row, and it is double regular sparse if all the columns and rows of it are sparse. The sparse approximate
inverse preconditioning procedures SPAI, PSAI($tol$) and RSAI($tol$) are costly and even impractical
to construct preconditioners for a large sparse nonsymmetric linear system with the coefficient
matrix being double irregular sparse, but they are efficient for double regular sparse problems.
Double irregular sparse linear systems have a wide range of applications, and 4.4\% of the nonsymmetric
matrices in the Florida University collection are double irregular sparse. For this class of problems,
we propose a transformation approach, which consists of four steps: (i) transform a given double
irregular sparse problem into a small number of double regular sparse ones with the same coefficient
matrix $\hat{A}$, (ii) use SPAI, PSAI($tol$) and RSAI($tol$) to construct sparse approximate
inverses $M$ of $\hat{A}$, (iii) solve the preconditioned double regular sparse linear systems
by Krylov solvers, and (iv) recover an approximate solution of the original problem with a prescribed
accuracy from those of the double regular sparse ones. A number of theoretical and practical issues
are considered on the transformation approach. Numerical experiments on a number of real-world
problems confirm the very sharp superiority of the transformation approach to the standard approach
that preconditions the original double irregular sparse problem by SPAI, PSAI($tol$) or RSAI($tol$)
and solves the resulting preconditioned system by Krylov solvers.
