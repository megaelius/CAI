We consider a natural model of inhomogeneous random graphs that extends the classical Erdos-Renyi
graphs and shares a close connection with the multiplicative coalescence, as pointed out by Aldous
. In this model, the vertices are assigned weights that govern their tendency to form edges. It is
by looking at the asymptotic distributions of the masses (sum of the weights) of the connected components
of these graphs that Aldous and Limic have identified the entrance boundary of the multiplicative
coalescence, which is intimately related to the excursion lengths of certain Levy-type processes.
We, instead, look at the metric structure of these components and prove their Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov
convergence to a class of random compact measured metric spaces. Our asymptotic regimes relate
directly to the general convergence condition appearing in the work of Aldous and Limic. Our techniques
provide a unified approach for this general "critical" regime, and relies upon two key ingredients:
an encoding of the graph by some Levy process as well as an embedding of its connected components into
Galton-Watson forests. This embedding transfers asymptotically into an embedding of the limit
objects into a forest of Levy trees, which allows us to give an explicit construction of the limit
objects from the excursions of the Levy-type process. As a consequence of our construction, we give
a transparent and explicit condition for the compactness of the limit objects and determine their
fractal dimensions. These results extend and complement several previous results that had obtained
via model- or regime-specific proofs, for instance: the case of Erdos-Renyi random graphs obtained
by Addario-Berry, Goldschmidt and B., the asymptotic homogeneous case as studied by Bhamidi, Sen
and Wang, or the power-law case as considered by Bhamidi, Sen and van der Hofstad.
