The aim of this paper is to provide a mathematical theory for understanding the mechanism behind
the double-negative refractive index phenomenon in bubbly fluids. The design of double-negative
metamaterials generally requires the use of two different kinds of subwavelength resonators,
which may limits the applicability of double-negative metamaterials. Herein we rely on media that
consists of only a single type of resonant element, and show how to turn the acoustic metamaterial
with a single negative effective property obtained in [H. Ammari and H. Zhang, Effective medium
theory for acoustic waves in bubbly fluids near Minnaert resonant frequency. SIAM J. Math. Anal.,
49 (2017), 3252--3276.] into a negative refractive index metamaterial, which refracts waves negatively,
hence acting as a superlens. Using bubble dimers made of two identical bubbles, it is proved that
both the effective mass density and the bulk modulus of the bubbly fluid can be negative near the anti-resonance
of the two hybridized Minnaert resonances for a single constituent bubble dimer. A rigorous justification
of the Minnaert resonance hybridization, in the case of a bubble dimer in a homogeneous medium, is
established. The acoustic properties of a single bubble dimer are analyzed. Asymptotic formulas
for the two hybridized Minnaert resonances are derived. Moreover, it is proved that the bubble dimer
can be approximated by a point scatterer with monopole and dipole modes. For an appropriate volume
fraction of bubble dimers with certain conditions on their configuration, a double-negative effective
medium when the frequency is near the anti-resonance of the hybridized Minnaert resonances can
be obtained.
