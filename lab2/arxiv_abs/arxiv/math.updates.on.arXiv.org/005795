In the context of cell motility modelling and more particularly related to the Filament Based Lamelipodium
Model [Manhart et al 2015 & 2017], this work deals with a rigorous mathematical proof of convergence
between solutions of two problems : we start from a microscopic description of adhesions using a
delayed and constrained vector valued equation with spacial diffusion and show the convergence
towards the corresponding friction limit. The convergence is performed with respect to the bond
characteristic lifetime $\varepsilon$ whose inverse is also proportional to the stifness of the
bonds. The originality of this work is the extension of gradient flow techniques to our setting.
Namely, the discrete finite difference term in the gradient flow energy is here replaced by a delay
term which complicates greatly the mathematical analysis. Contrarily to the standard approach
[Oelz SeMa 2011], compactness in time is not provided by the energy minimization process~: a series
of past times are taken into account in our discrete energy. A supplementary equation on the time
derivative is obtained requiring uniform estimate with respect to $\varepsilon$ of the Lagrange
multiplier and provides compactness. Due to the non-linearity induced by the constraint, a specific
stability estimate useful in our previous works, is not at hand here. Numerical simulations even
showed that this estimate does not hold. Nevertheless, transposing our delay operator, we succeed
in proving convergence under slightly weaker hypotheses. The result relies on a careful initial
layer analysis, extending [Milisic Esaim Proc 2018] to the space dependent setting.
