This paper discusses tractable development and statistical estimation of a continuous time stochastic
process with a finite state space having non-Markov property. The process is formed by a finite mixture
of right-continuous Markov jump processes moving at different speeds on the same finite state space,
whereas the speed regimes are assumed to be unobservable. The mixture was first proposed by Frydman
(J. Am. Stat. Assoc., 100, 1046-1053, 2005) in 2005 and recently generalized in Surya (Stoch. Syst.
8, 29-44, 2018), in which distributional properties and explicit identities of the process are
given in its full generality. The contribution of this paper is two fold. First, we present Monte
Carlo method for constructing the process and show distributional equivalence between the simulated
process and the actual process. Secondly, we perform statistical inference on the distribution
parameters of the process. Under complete observation of the sample paths, maximum likelihood
estimates are given in explicit form in terms of sufficient statistics of the process. Estimation
under incomplete observation is performed using the EM algorithm. The estimation results completely
characterize the process in terms of the initial probability of starting the process in any phase
of the state space, intensity matrices of the underlying Markov jump processes, and the switching
probability matrix of the process. Some numerical examples are given to test the performance of
the developed method. The proposed estimation generalizes the existing statistical inferences
for the Markov model by Albert (Ann. Math. Statist., 38, p.727-753., 1961), the mover-stayer model
by Frydman (J. Am. Stat. Assoc.79, 632-638., 1984) and the Markov mixture model by Frydman (J. Am.
Stat. Assoc., 100, 1046-1053, 2005).
