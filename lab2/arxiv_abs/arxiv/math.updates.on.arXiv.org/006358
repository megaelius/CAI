We consider systems of heat equations over bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$, subject to Neumann
boundary conditions, that are coupled by a matrix-valued potential $V$. It is easy to see that, even
if the potential is chosen not to destroy the boundedness of the solutions over time, $V$ can for instance
cause the occurrence of periodic solutions. This raises the question for which choices of $V$ all
solutions of the system converge to an equilibrium as $t \to \infty$. While this is clearly a fundamental
question about systems of parabolic equations, up to now no systematic study of this phenomenon
seems to have been undertaken. In this article we close this gap for a large class of potentials. It
first turns out that, if the potential is dissipative with respect to the Euclidean norm, the long-term
behaviour of the solutions is quite easy to analyse by means of classical Hilbert space methods.
If, however, the potential is $p$-dissipative for some $p \not= 2$, or if one chooses to include non-symmetric
differential operators that describe the heat flow, the matter becomes much more delicate, and
classical approaches seem to fail. We solve this issue by employing recent spectral theoretic results
that rely on the geometric structure of $L^p$-spaces. Since we wish to cover also the case $p = \infty$
- and since we are further interested in the case of systems with unbounded coefficients on the whole
space $\mathbb{R}^d$ - the solutions to our differential equations cannot, in general, be described
by means of $C_0$-semigroups. To overcome this difficulty, we prove - in the theoretical part of
the paper - a convergence theorem for a very general class of operator semigroups without any time
regularity assumptions.
