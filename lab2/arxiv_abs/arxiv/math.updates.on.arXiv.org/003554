The limited fronthaul capacity imposes a challenge on the uplink of centralized radio access network
(C-RAN). We propose to boost the fronthaul capacity of massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) aided C-RAN by globally optimizing the power sharing between channel estimation and data
transmission both for the user devices (UDs) and the remote radio units (RRUs). Intuitively, allocating
more power to the channel estimation will result in more accurate channel estimates, which increases
the achievable throughput. However, increasing the power allocated to the pilot training will
reduce the power assigned to data transmission, which reduces the achievable throughput. In order
to optimize the powers allocated to the pilot training and to the data transmission of both the UDs
and the RRUs, we assign an individual power sharing factor to each of them and derive an asymptotic
closed-form expression of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise for the massive MIMO aided
C-RAN consisting of both the UD-to-RRU links and the RRU-to-baseband unit (BBU) links. We then exploit
the C-RAN architecture's central computing and control capability for jointly optimizing the
UDs' power sharing factors and the RRUs' power sharing factors aiming for maximizing the fronthaul
capacity. Our simulation results show that the fronthaul capacity is significantly boosted by
the proposed global optimization of the power allocation between channel estimation and data transmission
both for the UDs and for their host RRUs. As a specific example of 32 receive antennas (RAs) deployed
by RRU and 128 RAs deployed by BBU, the sum-rate of 10 UDs achieved with the optimal power sharing factors
improves 33\% compared with the one attained without optimizing power sharing factors.
