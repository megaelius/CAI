Regularization is necessary for solving nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems arising in different
fields of geosciences. The base of a suitable regularization is the prior expressed by the regularizer,
which can be non-adaptive or adaptive (data-driven). In this paper, we propose general black-box
regularization algorithms for solving nonlinear inverse problems such as full-waveform inversion
(FWI), which admit empirical priors that are determined adaptively by sophisticated denoising
algorithms. The nonlinear inverse problem is solved by a proximal Newton method, which generalizes
the traditional Newton step in such a way to involve the gradients/subgradients of a (possibly non-differentiable)
regularization function through operator splitting and proximal mappings. Furthermore, it requires
to account for the Hessian matrix in the regularized least-squares optimization problem. We propose
two different splitting algorithms for this task. In the first, we compute the Newton search direction
with an iterative method based upon the first-order generalized iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (ISTA), and hence Newton-ISTA (NISTA). The iterations require only Hessian-vector
products to compute the gradient step of the quadratic approximation of the nonlinear objective
function. The second relies on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and hence
Newton-ADMM (NADMM), where the least-square optimization subproblem and the regularization
subproblem in the composite are decoupled through auxiliary variable and solved in an alternating
mode. We compare NISTA and NADMM numerically by solving full-waveform inversion with BM3D regularizations.
The tests show promising results obtained by both algorithms. However, NADMM shows a faster convergence
rate than Newton-ISTA when using L-BFGS to solve the Newton system.
