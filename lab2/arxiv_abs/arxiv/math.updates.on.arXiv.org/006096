Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications are expected to be incorporated in future wireless
networks, in particular 5G and beyond networks, to provide global wireless access with enhanced
data rates. Massive MIMO techniques, though widely used in terrestrial communication systems,
have not been applied to LEO satellite communication systems. In this paper, we propose a massive
MIMO transmission scheme with full frequency reuse (FFR) for LEO satellite communication systems
and exploit statistical channel state information (sCSI) to address the difficulty of obtaining
instantaneous CSI (iCSI) at the transmitter. We first establish the massive MIMO channel model
for LEO satellite communications and simplify the transmission designs via performing Doppler
and delay compensations at user terminals (UTs). Then, we develop the low-complexity sCSI based
downlink (DL) precoder and uplink (UL) receiver in closed-form, aiming to maximize the average
signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ASLNR) and the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (ASINR), respectively. It is shown that the DL ASLNRs and UL ASINRs of all UTs reach their upper
bounds under some channel condition. Motivated by this, we propose a space angle based user grouping
(SAUG) algorithm to schedule the served UTs into different groups, where each group of UTs use the
same time and frequency resource. The proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense
that the lower and upper bounds of the achievable rate coincide when the number of satellite antennas
or UT groups is sufficiently large. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed massive MIMO
transmission scheme with FFR significantly enhances the data rate of LEO satellite communication
systems. Notably, the proposed sCSI based precoder and receiver achieve the similar performance
with the iCSI based ones that are often infeasible in practice.
