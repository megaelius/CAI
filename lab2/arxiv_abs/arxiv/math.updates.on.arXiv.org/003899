In this article we develop a multi-grid multi-level Monte Carlo (MGMLMC) method for the stochastic
Stokes-Darcy interface model with random hydraulic conductivity both in the porous media domain
and on the interface. Because the randomness through the interface affects the flow in the Stokes
domain, we investigate the coupled stochastic Stokes-Darcy model to improve the fidelity as this
model also considers the second and third porosity of the free flow. Then we prove the existence and
uniqueness of the weak solution of the variational form. For the numerical solution, we adopt the
Monte Carlo (MC) method and finite element method (FEM), for the discrete form in the probability
space and physical space, respectively. In the traditional single-level Monte Carlo (SLMC) method,
more accurate numerical approximate requires both larger number of samples in probability space
and smaller mesh size in the physical space. Then the computational cost increase significantly
as the mesh size becomes smaller for the more accurate numerical approximate. Therefore we adopt
the multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to dramatically reduce the computational cost in the
probability space, because the number of samples decays fast while the mesh size decreases. We also
develop a strategy to calculate the number of samples needed in MLMC method for the stochastic Stokes-Darcy
model. Furthermore MLMC naturally provides the hierarchial grids and sufficient information
on these grids for multi-grid (MG) method, which can in turn improve the efficiency of MLMC. In order
to fully make use of the dynamical interaction between this two methods, we propose the multi-grid
multi-level Monte Carlo method for more efficiently solving the stochastic model. Numerical examples
are provided to verify and illustrate the proposed method and the theoretical conclusions.
