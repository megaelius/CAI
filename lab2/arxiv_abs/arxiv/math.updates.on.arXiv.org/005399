There is a substantial literature concerning Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in two dimensions
with conformal matter field of central charge ${\mathbf{c}}_{\mathrm M}\in(-\infty,1]$. Via
the DDK ansatz, LQG can equivalently be described as the random geometry obtained by exponentiating
$\gamma$ times a variant of the planar Gaussian free field (GFF), where $\gamma\in(0,2]$ satisfies
$\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}=25-6(2/\gamma+\gamma/2)^2$. Physics considerations suggest that LQG
should also make sense in the regime when $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}>1$. However, the behavior in this
regime is rather mysterious in part because the corresponding value of $\gamma$ is complex, so analytic
continuations of various formulas give complex answers which are difficult to interpret in a probabilistic
setting. We introduce and study a discretization of LQG which makes sense for all values of $\mathbf
c_{\mathrm M}\in(-\infty,25)$. Our discretization consists of a random planar map, defined as
the adjacency graph of a tiling of the plane by dyadic squares which all have approximately the same
"LQG size" with respect to the GFF. We prove that several formulas for dimension-related quantities
are still valid for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(1,25)$, with the caveat that the dimension is infinite
when the formulas give a complex answer. In particular, we prove an extension of the (geometric)
KPZ formula for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(1,25)$, which gives a finite quantum dimension iff the
Euclidean dimension is at most $(25-\mathbf c_{\mathrm M})/12$. We also show that the graph distance
between typical points with respect to our discrete model grows polynomially whereas the cardinality
of a graph distance ball of radius $r$ grows faster than any power of $r$ (which suggests that the Hausdorff
dimension of LQG is infinite for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(1,25)$). We include a substantial list
of open problems.
