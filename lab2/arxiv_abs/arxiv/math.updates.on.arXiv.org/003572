A spanning 2-forest separating vertices $u$ and $v$ of an undirected connected graph is a spanning
forest with 2 components such that $u$ and $v$ are in distinct components. Aside from their combinatorial
significance, spanning 2-forests have an important application to the calculation of resistance
distance or effective resistance. The resistance distance between vertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph
representing an electrical circuit with unit resistance on each edge is the number of spanning 2-forests
separating $u$ and $v$ divided by the number of spanning trees in the graph. It is well-known that
the number of these spanning 2-forests separating $u$ and $v$ in a graph is equal to the determinant
of the matrix obtained from the combinatorial Laplacian matrix of the graph by deleting the rows
and columns corresponding to $u$ and $v$. For most interesting graphs, neither of these quantities
can be easily found. For any connected graph $G$ with a 2-separator and its associated decomposition
which separates $u$ and $v$, we show that the number of spanning trees and spanning 2-forests separating
$u$ and $v$ can be expressed in terms of the number of spanning trees and 2-forests in the smaller graphs
in the decomposition, which makes computation significantly more tractable. An important special
case is the preservation of the number of spanning 2-forests if $u$ and $v$ are on the "same side" of
the decomposition. We apply these results to derive an exact formula for the number of spanning 2-forests
separating $u$ and $v$ for any linear 2-tree with a single bend. We focus in particular on the case
in which $u$ and $v$ are the end (degree 2) vertices of the linear 2-tree, interpret these as resistance
distances, and analyze these values with respect to the location of the bend.
