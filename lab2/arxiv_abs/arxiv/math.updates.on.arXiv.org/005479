We establish the average-case hardness of the algorithmic problem of exact computation of the partition
function associated with the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses with Gaussian couplings
and random external field. In particular, we establish that unless $P= \#P$, there does not exist
a polynomial-time algorithm to exactly compute the partition function on average. This is done
by showing that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm, which exactly computes the partition
function for inverse polynomial fraction ($1/n^{O(1)}$) of all inputs, then there is a polynomial
time algorithm, which exactly computes the partition function for all inputs, with high probability,
yielding $P=\#P$. The computational model that we adopt is {\em finite-precision arithmetic},
where the algorithmic inputs are truncated first to a certain level $N$ of digital precision. The
ingredients of our proof include the random and downward self-reducibility of the partition function
with random external field; an argument of Cai et al. \cite{cai1999hardness} for establishing
the average-case hardness of computing the permanent of a matrix; a list-decoding algorithm of
Sudan \cite{sudan1996maximum}, for reconstructing polynomials intersecting a given list of
numbers at sufficiently many points; and near-uniformity of the log-normal distribution, modulo
a large prime $p$. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first one establishing a provable
hardness of a model arising in the field of spin glasses. Furthermore, we extend our result to the
same problem under a different {\em real-valued} computational model, e.g. using a Blum-Shub-Smale
machine \cite{blum1988theory} operating over real-valued inputs.
