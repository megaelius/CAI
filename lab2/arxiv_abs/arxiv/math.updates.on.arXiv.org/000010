We introduced the new compactification of a topological space using the notion of Berkovich's spectrum
of a Banach algebra over a non-Archimedean field. We proved that the compactification is a totally
disconnected Hausdorff compactification, and is homeomorphic to the universal totally disconnected
Hausdorff compacdtification. In particular, the compactification is independent of the choice
of the base field k and the residual characteristic p. Moreover if the base field k is a finite field
or a local field, the compactification satisfies the extension property for a k-valued bounded
continuous map as the Stone-Cech compactification does that for a real-valued bounded continuous
map. It yields a partial solution for the non-Archimedean analogue of Kaplansy Conjecture for the
automatic continuity problem. Namely, if k is a local field, any injective k-algebra homomorphism
from the commutative Banach k-algebra of bounded continuous functions to a Banach k-algebra is
continuous if its image is closed. In particular it contains a criterion for the continuity of a p-adic
linear representation. Furthermore, we verified the Gel'fand theory for "a non-Archimedean completely
regular Hausdorff topological space", that is, a totally disconnected Hausdorff space. There
is a canonical contravariantly functorial one-to-one correspondence between totally disconnected
Hausdorff compactifications and closed k-subalgebras of the Banach k-algebra of bounded continuous
functions separating points. The assumption that the base field k is a finite field or a local field
is essential, and can never be removed in many propositions here. We proved that unless the base topological
space is compact, or unless the base field k is a finite field or a local field, then the propositions
have counter-examples.
