The Faddeev-Popov rules for quantization of theory with gauge group are generalized for case of
nvariance of quantum actions, $S_N$, on N-parametric Abelian SUSY transformations with odd parameters
$\lambda_p$, p=1,..,N and anticommuting generators $s_p$, for N=3,4 implying substitution of
ghost fields N-plet, $C^p$ multipled on $\lambda_p$, instead of the parameter, $\xi$, of gauge
transformations. Total configuration spaces for quantum theory of the same classical model coincide
for N=3 ,4 cases. For N=3 transformations the superspace of irrep includes in addition 3 ghost $C^p$,
3 even $B^{pq}$ and odd $\hat{B}$ fields for p,q=1-3. It is shown for quantum action $S_{3}$ the gauge-fixing
by adding to classical action of N=3-exact term requires 1 antighost $\bar{C}$, 3 even $B^{p}$ 3
odd $\hat{B}{}^p$ and Nakanishi--Lautrup fields. Action of N=3 transformations on the latter
fields is found. The transformations appear by N=3 BRST ones for the vacuum functional, $Z_3(0)
$. It is shown, the configuration space appears by irrep superspace for fields $\Phi_4$ for N=4-
transformations containing in addition to $A^\mu$: (4+6+4+1) ghost-antighost $C^r$, even $B^{rs}$,
odd $\hat{B}{}^r $ fields and B. Action $S_4$ is constructed by adding to classical action of N=4-exact
with gauge boson $F_4$ as compared to gauge fermion $\Psi_3$ for N=3 case. Procedure is valid for
any admissible gauge. The equivalence with $N=1$ BRST-invariant quantization method is explicitly
found. Finite N=3,4 BRST transformations are derived from algebraic transformations. Respective
Jacobians for field-dependent parameters are calculated. They imply the presence of corresponding
modified Ward identity to be reduced to new (usual) Ward identities for constant parameters and
describe the problem of gauge-dependence. Introduction into diagrammatic Feynman techniques
for N=3,4 cases is suggested.
