This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, that we call an auto-precoder, and a deep-learning
based approach that jointly senses the millimeter wave (mmWave) channel and designs the hybrid
precoding matrices with only a few training pilots. More specifically, the proposed machine learning
model leverages the prior observations of the channel to achieve two objectives. First, it optimizes
the compressive channel sensing vectors based on the surrounding environment in an unsupervised
manner to focus the sensing power on the most promising spatial directions. This is enabled by a novel
neural network architecture that accounts for the constraints on the RF chains and models the transmitter/receiver
measurement matrices as two complex-valued convolutional layers. Second, the proposed model
learns how to construct the RF beamforming vectors of the hybrid architectures directly from the
projected channel vector (the received sensing vector). The auto-precoder neural network that
incorporates both the channel sensing and beam prediction is trained end-to-end as a multi-task
classification problem. Thanks to this design methodology that leverages the prior channel observations
and the implicit awareness about the surrounding environment/user distributions, the proposed
approach significantly reduces the training overhead compared to classical (non-machine learning)
solutions. For example, for a system of 64 transmit and 64 receive antennas, with 3 RF chains at both
sides, the proposed solution needs only 8 or 16 channel training pilots to directly predict the RF
beamforming/combining vectors of the hybrid architectures and achieve near-optimal achievable
rates. This highlights a promising solution for the channel estimation and hybrid precoding design
problem in mmWave and massive MIMO systems.
