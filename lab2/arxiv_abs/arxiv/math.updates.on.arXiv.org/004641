We survey known solutions to the infinite extendibility problem for (necessarily exchangeable)
probability laws on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which is: Can a given random vector $\vec{X} = (X1,\ldots,X_d)$
be represented in distribution as the first $d$ members of an infinite exchangeable sequence of
random variables? This is the case if and only if $\vec{X}$ has a stochastic representation that
is "conditionally iid" according to the seminal De Finetti's Theorem. Of particular interest are
cases in which the original motivation behind the model $\vec{X}$ is not one of conditional independence.
After an introduction and some general theory, the survey covers the traditional cases when $\vec{X}$
takes values in $\{0,1\}^d$ has a spherical law, a law with $\ell_1$-norm symmetric survival function,
or a law with $\ell_{\infty}$-norm symmetric density. The solutions in all These cases constitute
analytical characterizations of mixtures of iid sequences drawn from popular, one-parametric
probability laws on $\mathbb{R}$, like the Bernoulli, the normal, the exponential, or the uniform
distribution. The survey further covers the less traditional cases when $\vec{X}$ has a Marshall-Olkin
distribution, a multivariate wide-sense geometric distribution, a multivariate extreme-value
distribution, or is defined as a certain exogenous shock model including the special case when its
components are samples from a Dirichlet prior. The solutions in these cases correspond to iid sequences
drawn from random distribution functions defined in terms of popular families of non-decreasing
stochastic processes, like a L\'evy subordinator, a random walk, a process that is strongly infinitely
divisible with respect to time, or an additive process. The survey finishes with a list of potentially
interesting open problems.
