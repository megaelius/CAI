We introduce a numerical method for the solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation with
a smooth potential, based on its reformulation as a Volterra integral equation. We present versions
of the method both for periodic boundary conditions, and for free space problems with compactly
supported initial data and potential. A spatially uniform electric field may be included, making
the solver applicable to simulations of light-matter interaction. The primary computational
challenge in using the Volterra formulation is the application of a space-time history dependent
integral operator. This may be accomplished by projecting the solution onto a set of Fourier modes,
and updating their coefficients from one time step to the next by a simple recurrence. In the periodic
case, the modes are those of the usual Fourier series, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used
to alternate between physical and frequency domain grids. In the free space case, the oscillatory
behavior of the spectral Green's function leads us to use a set of complex-frequency Fourier modes
obtained by discretizing a contour deformation of the inverse Fourier transform, and we develop
a corresponding fast transform based on the FFT. Our approach is related to pseudo-spectral methods,
but applied to an integral rather than the usual differential formulation. This has several advantages:
it avoids the need for artificial boundary conditions, admits simple, inexpensive high-order
implicit time marching schemes, and naturally includes time-dependent potentials. We present
examples in one and two dimensions showing spectral accuracy in space and eighth-order accuracy
in time for both periodic and free space problems.
