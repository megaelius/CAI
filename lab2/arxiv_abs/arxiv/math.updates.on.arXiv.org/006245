Classical probabilistic models of (noisy) quantum systems are not only relevant for understanding
the non-classical features of quantum mechanics, but they are also useful for determining the possible
advantage of using quantum resources for information processing tasks. A common feature of these
models is the presence of inaccessible information, as captured by the concept of preparation contextuality:
There are ensembles of quantum states described by the same density operator, and hence operationally
indistinguishable, and yet in any probabilistic (ontological) model, they should be described
by distinct probability distributions. In this work, we quantify the inaccessible information
of a model in terms of the maximum distinguishability of probability distributions associated
to any pair of ensembles with identical density operators, as quantified by the total variation
distance of the distributions. We obtain a family of lower bounds on this maximum distinguishability
in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. In the case of an ideal qubit this leads to a lower
bound of, approximately, 0.07. These bounds can also be interpreted as a new class of robust preparation
non-contextuality inequalities. Our non-contextuality inequalities are phrased in terms of
generalizations of max-relative entropy and trace distance for general operational theories,
which could be of independent interest. Under sufficiently strong noise any quantum system becomes
preparation non-contextual, i.e., can be described by models with zero inaccessible information.
Using our non-contextuality inequalities, we show that this can happen only if the noise channel
has the average gate fidelity less than or equal to 1/D(1+1/2+...+1/D), where D is the dimension
of the Hilbert space.
