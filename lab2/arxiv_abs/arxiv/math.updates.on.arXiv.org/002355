The paper constitutes the second part on the subject of finite part integration of the generalized
Stieltjes transform $S_{\lambda}[f]=\int_0^{\infty} f(x) (\omega+x)^{-\lambda}\mathrm{d}x$
about $\omega = 0$ where now $\lambda$ is a non-integer positive real number. Divergent integrals
with singularities at the origin are induced by writing $(\omega+x)^{-\lambda}$ as a binomial
expansion about $\omega = 0$ and interchanging the order of operations of integration and summation.
The prescription of finite part integration is then implemented by interpreting these divergent
integrals as finite part integrals which are rigorously represented as complex contour integrals.
The same contour is then used to express $S_{\lambda}[f]$ itself as a complex contour integral.
This led to the recovery of the terms missed by naive term-wise integration which themselves are
finite parts of divergent integrals whose singularity is at the finite upper limit of integration.
When the function $f(x)$ has a zero at the origin of order $m=0,1,\dots$ such that $m-\lambda<0$
the correction terms missed out by naive term by term integration give the dominant contribution
to $S_{\lambda}[f]$ as $\omega\to 0$. Otherwise, the correction term is sub-dominant to the leading
convergent terms in the naive term by term integration. We apply these results by obtaining exact
and asymptotic representations of the Kummer and Gauss hypergeometric functions by evaluating
their known Stieltjes integral representations. We then apply the method of finite part integration
to obtain the asymptotic behavior of a generalization of the Stieltjes integral which is relevant
in the calculation of the effective index of refraction of a shallow potential well.
