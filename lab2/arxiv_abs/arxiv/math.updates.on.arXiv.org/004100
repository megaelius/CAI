Collecting data from massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices is a challenging task, since communication
circuits are power-demanding while energy supply at IoT devices is limited. To overcome this challenge,
backscatter communication emerges as a promising solution as it eliminates radio frequency components
in IoT devices. Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter communication is short.
To facilitate backscatter communication, this work proposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle
(UGV) with backscatter data collection. With such a scheme, the UGV could improve the communication
quality by approaching various IoT devices. However, moving also costs energy consumption and
a fundamental question is: what is the right balance between spending energy on moving versus on
communication? To answer this question, this paper studies energy minimization under a joint graph
mobility and backscatter communication model. With the joint model, the mobility management and
power allocation problem unfortunately involves nonlinear coupling between discrete variables
brought by mobility and continuous variables brought by communication. Despite the optimization
challenges, an algorithm that theoretically achieves the minimum energy consumption is derived,
and it leads to automatic trade-off between spending energy on moving versus on communication in
the UGV backscatter system. Simulation results show that if the noise power is small (e.g., -100
dBm), the UGV should collect the data with small movements. However, if the noise power is increased
to a larger value (e.g., -60 dBm), the UGV should spend more motion energy to get closer to IoT users.
