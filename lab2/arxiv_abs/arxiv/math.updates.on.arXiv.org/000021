The vanishing of reduced $\ell^2$-cohomology for amenable groups can be traced to the work of Cheeger
& Gromov in \cite{CG}. Whether the same thing can be said for other $p \in ]1,\infty[$ still remains
open. In this paper, result for the triviality of $\ssl{\ell^pH}^1(G)$ are obtained, for example:
when $p \in ]1,2]$ and $G$ amenable; when $p \in ]1,\infty[$ and $G$ is Liouville (e.g. of intermediate
growth). An answer is also given to a question of Pansu, relating this vanishing to the absence of
non-constant bounded harmonic functions whose gradient is in $\ell^p$. The natural quotient from
reduced $\ell^q$-cohomology to reduced $\ell^p$-cohomology ($1\leq q<p$) is also shown to
be an inclusion for groups which are not virtually-$\zz$ and for graphs satisfying a $d$-dimensional
isoperimetric profile with $d >2p$. This is used to obtain an alternative proof of the following
statement: if $G$ is a group admitting a presentation with $k$ generators and $\leq k-2$ relations,
and if $N$ is a normal subgroup then either $N$ is finite, $N$ is of finite index, or $N$ is not finitely
generated. The vanishing of reduced $\ell^p$-cohomology implies the absence of non-constant
$p$-harmonic continuous functions or forms ($p \in ]1,\infty[$). Using the invariance properties,
the above results transfer to Riemannian manifolds of bounded geometry quasi-isometric to the
afore-mentioned graphs and groups. For example, if $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $\pi_1(M)$
is amenable, then there are no non-constant continuous $p$-harmonic functions on the universal
cover $\widetilde{M}$ of $M$ for $p \in ]1,2]$. Also, if $M$ satisfies a $d$-dimensional isoperimetric
inequality, $d> 2p$ and $M$ is Liouville then $\ssl{\ell^pH}^1(M) = \{0\}$.
