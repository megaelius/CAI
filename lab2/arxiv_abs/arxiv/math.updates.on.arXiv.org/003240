In this paper, a multiscale flux basis algorithm is developed to efficiently solve a flow problem
in fractured porous media. Here, we take into account a mixed-dimensional setting of the discrete
fracture matrix model, where the fracture network is represented as lower-dimensional object.
We assume the linear Darcy model in the rock matrix and the non-linear Forchheimer model in the fractures.
In our formulation, we are able to reformulate the matrix-fracture problem to only the fracture
network problem and, therefore, significantly reduce the computational cost. The resulting problem
is then a non-linear interface problem that can be solved using a fixed-point or Newton-Krylov methods,
which in each iteration require several solves of Robin problems in the surrounding rock matrices.
To achieve this, the flux exchange (a linear Robin-to-Neumann co-dimensional mapping) between
the porous medium and the fracture network is done offline by pre-computing a multiscale flux basis
that consists of the flux response from each degree of freedom on the fracture network. This delivers
a conserve for the basis that handles the solutions in the rock matrices for each degree of freedom
in the fractures pressure space. Then, any Robin sub-domain problems are replaced by linear combinations
of the multiscale flux basis during the interface iteration. The proposed approach is, thus, agnostic
to the physical model in the fracture network. Numerical experiments demonstrate the computational
gains of pre-computing the flux exchange between the porous medium and the fracture network against
standard non-linear domain decomposition approaches.
