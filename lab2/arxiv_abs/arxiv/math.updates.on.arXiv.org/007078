The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are a popular class of high order accurate
numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). However when
the spatial dimensions are high, the number of spatial grid points increases significantly. It
leads to large amount of operations and computational costs in the numerical simulations by using
nonlinear high order accuracy WENO schemes such as a fifth order WENO scheme. How to achieve fast
simulations by high order WENO methods for high spatial dimension hyperbolic PDEs is a challenging
and important question. In the literature, sparse-grid technique has been developed as a very efficient
approximation tool for high dimensional problems. In a recent work [Lu, Chen and Zhang, Pure and
Applied Mathematics Quarterly, 14 (2018) 57-86], a third order finite difference WENO method with
sparse-grid combination technique was designed to solve multidimensional hyperbolic equations
including both linear advection equations and nonlinear Burgers' equations. In application problems,
higher than third order WENO schemes are often preferred in order to efficiently resolve the complex
solution structures. In this paper, we extend the approach to higher order WENO simulations specifically
the fifth order WENO scheme. A fifth order WENO interpolation is applied in the prolongation part
of the sparse-grid combination technique to deal with discontinuous solutions. Benchmark problems
are first solved to show that significant CPU times are saved while both fifth order accuracy and
stability of the WENO scheme are preserved for simulations on sparse grids. The fifth order sparse
grid WENO method is then applied to kinetic problems modeled by high dimensional Vlasov based PDEs
to further demonstrate large savings of computational costs by comparing with simulations on regular
single grids.
