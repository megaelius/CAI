We study interactive coding schemes which allow to simulate any n-round interactive protocol over
an adversarial channel that is allowed to corrupt a constant fraction of all transmissions. Our
coding schemes are the first to simultaneously i) tolerate the optimal error rates, ii) be computationally
efficient, and iii) use an almost linear number of rounds. The said coding schemes address four different
settings of interest: We give a computationally efficient non-adaptive coding scheme that tolerates
any error rate below 1/4 and uses O(n) rounds. While this error rate is optimal for non-adaptive protocols,
it is known that the error rate can be improved to 2/7 for adaptive coding schemes and to 1/2 if the decoding
requirement is relaxed to list decoding. We show furthermore that an error rate of 1/3 is achievable,
and in fact optimal, if only one party is required to decode. For these last three settings, we give
computationally efficient coding schemes that tolerate these optimal error rates and use $n 2^{O(\log^*
n \, \cdot \, \log{\log^* n})}$ rounds. Prior coding schemes achieving these optimal error rates
required $\Theta(n^2)$ rounds. We obtain these results by first considering channels that are
controlled by a computationally bounded adversary. This simpler cryptographic setting provides
valuable insights and reveals intimate connections between list decodable interactive coding
schemes and the standard unique decoding requirement. We then show that these connections carry
over to the information theoretic setting. In fact, all our results are obtained by first taking
an inefficient list decodable coding scheme, then boosting its efficiency, and lastly applying
a new generic reduction to the particular unique decoding setting in question. We believe these
insights and individual building blocks to be of independent interest.
