The n-solvable filtration {F_n}_{n=0}^\infty of the smooth knot concordance group (denoted by
C), due to Cochran-Orr-Teichner, has been instrumental in the study of knot concordance in recent
years. Part of its significance is due to the fact that certain geometric characterizations of a
knot imply membership in various levels of the filtration. We show the counterpart of this fact for
two new filtrations of C due to Cochran-Harvey-Horn, the positive and negative filtrations, denoted
by {P_n}_{n=0}^\infty and {N_n}_{n=0}^\infty respectively. In particular, we show that if a knot
K bounds a Casson tower of height n+2 in the 4-ball with only positive (resp. negative) kinks in the
base-level kinky disk, then K is in P_n (resp. N_n). En route to this result we show that if a knot K bounds
a Casson tower of height n+2 in the 4-ball, it bounds an embedded (symmetric) grope of height n+2,
and is therefore, n-solvable (this also implies that topologically slice knots bound arbitrarily
tall gropes in the 4-ball). We also define a variant of Casson towers and show that if K bounds a tower
of type (2,n) in the 4-ball, it is n-solvable. If K bounds such a tower with only positive (resp. negative)
kinks in the base-level kinky disk then K is in P_n (resp. N_n). Our results show that either every
knot which bounds a Casson tower of height three is topologically slice or there exists a knot which
is not topologically slice but lies in each F_n. We also give a 3-dimensional characterization,
up to concordance, of knots which bound kinky disks in the 4-ball with only positive (resp. negative)
kinks; such knots form a subset of P_0 (resp. N_0).
