Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising approach to efficiently disseminate critical
or viral information. Reaping the benefits of D2D-enabled networks is contingent upon choosing
the optimal content dissemination policy subject to resource and user distribution constraints.
In this paper, a novel D2D network analysis (DNA) framework is proposed to study the impacts of frequently
occurring subgraphs, known as motifs, on D2D network performance and to determine an effective
content dissemination strategy. In the proposed framework, the distribution of devices in the
D2D network is modeled as a Thomas cluster process (TCP), and two graph structures, the star and chain
motifs, are studied in the communication graph. Based on the stochastic properties of the TCP, closed-form
analytical expressions for the statistical significance, the outage probability, as well as the
average throughput per device, are derived. Simulation results corroborate the analytical derivations
and show the influence of different system topologies on the occurrence of motifs and the D2D system
throughput. More importantly, the results highlight that, as the statistical significance of
motifs increases, the system throughput will initially increase, and, then, decrease. Hence,
network operators can obtain statistical significance regions for chain and star motifs that map
to the optimal content dissemination performance. Furthermore, using the obtained regions and
the analytical expressions for statistical significance, network operators can effectively
identify which clusters of devices can be leveraged for D2D communications while determining the
number of serving devices in each identified cluster.
