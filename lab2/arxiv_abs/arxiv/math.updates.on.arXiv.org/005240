Equipping a spacecraft with multiple solar-powered electric engines (of the same or different
types) compounds the task of optimal trajectory design due to presence of both real-valued inputs
(power input to each engine in addition to the direction of thrust vector) and discrete variables
(number of active engines). Each engine can be switched on/off independently and "optimal" operating
power of each engine depends on the available solar power, which depends on the distance from the
Sun. Application of the Composite Smooth Control (CSC) framework to a heliocentric fuel-optimal
trajectory optimization from the Earth to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is demonstrated,
which presents a new approach to deal with multiple-engine problems. Operation of engine clusters
with 4, 6, 10 and even 20 engines of the same type can be optimized. Moreover, engine clusters with
different/mixed electric engines are considered with either 2, 3 or 4 different types of engines.
Remarkably, the CSC framework allows us 1) to reduce the original multi-point boundary-value problem
to a two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP), and 2) to solve the resulting TPBVPs using a single-shooting
solution scheme and with a random initialization of the missing costates. While the approach we
present is a continuous neighbor of the discontinuous extremals, we show that the discontinuous
necessary conditions are satisfied in the asymptotic limit. We believe this is the first indirect
method to accommodate a multi-mode control of this level of complexity with realistic engine performance
curves. The results are interesting and promising for dealing with a large family of such challenging
multi-mode optimal control problems.
