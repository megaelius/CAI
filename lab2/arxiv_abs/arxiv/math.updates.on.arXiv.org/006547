The overarching goal of this work is to develop an accurate, robust, and stable methodology for finite
deformation modeling using strong-form peridynamics (PD) and the correspondence modeling framework.
We adopt recently developed methods that make use of higher-order corrections to improve the computation
of integrals in the correspondence formulation. A unified approach is presented that incorporates
the reproducing kernel (RK) and generalized moving least square (GMLS) approximations in PD to
obtain higher-order gradients. We show, however, that the improved quadrature rule does not suffice
to handle correspondence-modeling instability issues. In Part I of this paper, a bond-associative,
higher-order core formulation is developed that naturally provides stability. Numerical examples
are provided to study the convergence of RK-PD, GMLS-PD, and their bond-associated versions to
a local counterpart, as the degree of non-locality approaches zero. It is shown that the bond-associative
approach improves the robustness of RK-PD and GMLS-PD formulations, which is essential for practical
applications. The higher-order, bond-associated model can obtain second-order convergence
for smooth problems and first-order convergence for problems involving field discontinuities,
such as curvilinear free surfaces. In Part II of this paper we use our unified PD framework to: (a)
study wave propagation phenomena, which have proven problematic for the state-based correspondence
PD framework; (b) propose a new methodology to enforce natural boundary conditions in correspondence
PD formulations, which should be particularly appealing to coupled problems. Our results indicate
that bond-associative formulations accompanied by higher-order gradient correction provide
the key ingredients to obtain the necessary accuracy, stability, and robustness characteristics
needed for engineering-scale simulations.
