From the viewpoint of the theory of orthomodular lattices of elementary propositions, Quantum
Theories can be formulated in real, complex or quaternionic Hilbert spaces as established in Sol\'er's
theorem. The said lattice eventually coincides with the lattice of all orthogonal projectors on
a separable Hilbert space over R, C, or over the algebra of quaternions H. Quantum states are $\sigma$-additive
probability measures on that non-Boolean lattice. Gleason's theorem proves that, if the Hilbert
space is separable with dimension >2 and the Hilbert space is either real or complex, then states
are one-to-one with standard density matrices (self-adjoint, positive, unit-trace, trace-class
operators). The extension of this result to quaternionic Hilbert spaces was obtained by Varadarajan
in 1968. Unfortunately, even if the hard part of the proof is correct, the formulation of this extension
is mathematically incorrect. This is due to some peculiarities of the notion of trace in quaternionic
Hilbert spaces, e.g., basis dependence, making the theory of trace-class operators in quaternionic
Hilbert spaces different from the standard theory in real and complex Hilbert spaces. A minor issue
also affects Varadarajan's statement for real Hilbert space formulation. This paper is mainly
devoted to present Gleason-Varadarajan's theorem into a technically correct form valid for the
three types of Hilbert spaces. After having develped part of the general mathematical technology
of trace-class operators in (generally non-separable) quaternionic Hilbert spaces, we prove
that only the {\em real part} of the trace enters the formalism of quantum theories (also dealing
with unbounded observables and symmetries) and it can be safely used to formulate and prove a common
statement of Gleason's theorem.
