Fine scale elastic structures are widespread in nature, for instances in plants or bones, whenever
stiffness and low weight are required. These patterns frequently refine towards a Dirichlet boundary
to ensure an effective load transfer. The paper discusses the optimization of such supporting structures
in a specific class of domain patterns in 2D, which composes of periodic and branching period transitions
on subdomain facets. These investigations can be considered as a case study to display examples
of optimal branching domain patterns. In explicit, a rectangular domain is decomposed into rectangular
subdomains, which share facets with neighbouring subdomains or with facets which split on one side
into equally sized facets of two different subdomains. On each subdomain one considers an elastic
material phase with stiff elasticity coefficients and an approximate void phase with orders of
magnitude softer material. For given load on the outer domain boundary, which is distributed on
a prescribed fine scale pattern representing the contact area of the shape, the interior elastic
phase is optimized with respect to the compliance cost. The elastic stress is supposed to be continuous
on the domain and a stress based finite volume discretization is used for the optimization. If in
one direction equally sized subdomains with equal adjacent subdomain topology line up, these subdomains
are consider as equal copies including the enforced boundary conditions for the stress and form
a locally periodic substructure. An alternating descent algorithm is employed for a discrete characteristic
function describing the stiff elastic subset on the subdomains and the solution of the elastic state
equation. Numerical experiments are shown for compression and shear load on the boundary of a quadratic
domain.
