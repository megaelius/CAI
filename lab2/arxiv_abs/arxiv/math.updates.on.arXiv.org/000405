This text presents some basic notions in symplectic geometry, Poisson geometry, Hamiltonian systems,
Lie algebras and Lie groups actions on symplectic or Poisson manifolds, momentum maps and their
use for the reduction of Hamiltonian systems. It should be accessible to readers with a general knowledge
of basic notions in differential geometry. Full proofs of many results are provided. The Marsden-Weinstein
reduction procedure and the Euler-Poincar\'e equation are discussed. Symplectic cocycles involved
when a momentum map is equivariant with respect to an affine action whose linear part is the coadjoint
action are presented. The Hamiltonian actions of a Lie group on its cotangent bundle obtained by
lifting the actions of the group on itself by translations on the left and on the right are fully discussed.
We prove that there exists a two-parameter family of deformations of these actions into a pair of
mutually symplectically orthogonal Hamiltonian actions whose momentum maps are equivariant
with respect to an affine action involving any given Lie group symplectic cocycle. In the last section
three classical examples are considered: the spherical pendulum, the motion of a rigid body around
a fixed point and the Kepler problem. For each example the Euler-Poincar\'e equation is derived,
the first integrals linked to symmetries are given. In this Section, the classical concepts of vector
calculus on an Euclidean three-dimensional vector space (scalar, vector and mixed products) are
used and their interpretation in terms of concepts such as the adjoint or coadjoint action of the
group of rotations are explained.
