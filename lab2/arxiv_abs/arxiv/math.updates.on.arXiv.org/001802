Spatiotemporal patterns such as traveling waves are frequently observed in recordings of neural
activity. The mechanisms underlying the generation of such patterns are largely unknown. Previous
studies have investigated the existence and uniqueness of different types of waves or bumps of activity
using neural-field models, phenomenological coarse-grained descriptions of neural-network
dynamics. But it remains unclear how these insights can be transferred to more biologically realistic
networks of spiking neurons, where individual neurons fire irregularly. Here, we employ mean-field
theory to reduce a microscopic model of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with distance-dependent
connectivity to an effective neural-field model. In contrast to existing phenomenological descriptions,
the dynamics in this neural-field model depends on the mean and the variance in the synaptic input,
both determining the amplitude and the temporal structure of the resulting effective coupling
kernel. For the neural-field model we derive conditions for the existence of spatial and temporal
oscillations and periodic traveling waves using linear stability analysis. We first prove that
periodic traveling waves cannot occur in a single homogeneous population of neurons, irrespective
of the form of distance dependence of the connection probability. Compatible with the architecture
of cortical neural networks, traveling waves emerge in two-population networks of excitatory
and inhibitory neurons as a combination of delay-induced temporal oscillations and spatial oscillations
due to distance-dependent connectivity profiles. Finally, we demonstrate quantitative agreement
between predictions of the analytically tractable neural-field model and numerical simulations
of both networks of nonlinear rate-based units and networks of LIF neurons.
