In 1995, Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'arf\'as proved that in every $2$-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, there
is a vertex cover by $2\sqrt{n}$ monochromatic paths of the same colour, which is optimal up to a constant
factor. The main goal of this paper is to study the natural multi-colour generalization of this problem:
given two positive integers $r,s$, what is the smallest number $\text{pc}_{r,s}(K_n)$ such that
in every colouring of the edges of $K_n$ with $r$ colours, there exists a vertex cover of $K_n$ by $\text{pc}_{r,s}(K_n)$
monochromatic paths using altogether at most $s$ different colours? For fixed integers $r>s$ and
as $n\to\infty$, we prove that $\text{pc}_{r,s}(K_n) = \Theta(n^{1/\chi})$, where $\chi=\max{\{1,2+2s-r\}}$
is the chromatic number of the Kneser gr aph $\text{KG}(r,r-s)$. More generally, if one replaces
$K_n$ by an arbitrary $n$-vertex graph with fixed independence number $\alpha$, then we have $\text{pc}_{r,s}(G)
= O(n^{1/\chi})$, where this time around $\chi$ is the chromatic number of the Kneser hypergraph
$\text{KG}^{(\alpha+1)}(r,r-s)$. This result is tight in the sense that there exist graphs with
independence number $\alpha$ for which $\text{pc}_{r,s}(G) = \Omega(n^{1/\chi})$. This is in
sharp contrast to the case $r=s$, where it follows from a result of S\'ark\"ozy (2012) that $\text{pc}_{r,r}(G)$
depends only on $r$ and $\alpha$, but not on the number of vertices. We obtain similar results for
the situation where instead of using paths, one wants to cover a graph with bounded independence
number by monochromatic cycles, or a complete graph by monochromatic $d$-regular graphs.
