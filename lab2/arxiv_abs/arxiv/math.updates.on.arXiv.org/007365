We study smooth {\sf traversing} vector fields $v$ on compact manifolds $X$ with boundary. A traversing
$v$ admits a Lyapunov function $f: X \to \Bbb R$ such that $df(v) > 0$. We show that the trajectory spaces
$\mathcal T(v)$ of {\sf traversally generic} $v$-flows are {\sf Whitney stratified spaces}, and
thus admit triangulations amenable to their natural stratifications. Despite being spaces with
singularities, $\mathcal T(v)$ retain some residual smooth structure of $X$. Let $\mathcal F(v)$
denote the oriented $1$-dimensional foliation on $X$, produced by a traversing $v$-flow. With
the help of a {\sf boundary generic} $v$, we divide the boundary $\partial X$ of $X$ into two complementary
compact manifolds, $\partial^+X(v)$ and $\partial^-X(v)$. Then, for a traversing $v$, we introduce
the {\sf causality map} $C_v: \partial^+X(v) \to \partial^-X(v)$. Our main result claims that,
for boundary generic traversing vector fields $v$, the causality map $C_v$ is allows for a reconstruction
of the pair $(X, \mathcal F(v))$, up to a homeomorphism $\Phi: X \to X$ such that $\Phi|_{\partial
X} = id_{\partial X}$. In other words, for a massive class of ODEs, we show that the topology of their
solutions, satisfying a given boundary value problem, is {\sf rigid}. We call these results ``{\sf
holographic}" since the $(n+1)$-dimensional $X$ and the un-parameterized dynamics of the $v$-flow
are captured by a single map $C_v$ between two $n$-dimensional screens, $\partial^+X(v)$ and $\partial^-X(v)$.
This holography of traversing flows has numerous applications to the dynamics of general flows.
Some of them are described in the paper. Others, are just outlined.
