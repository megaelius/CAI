Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is often an effective solver for symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear
systems resulting from the discretization of general elliptic PDEs, or the spatial discretization
of parabolic PDEs. However, convergence theory and most variations of AMG rely on $A$ being SPD.
Hyperbolic PDEs, which arise often in large-scale scientific simulations, remain a challenge
for AMG, as well as other fast linear solvers, in part because the resulting linear systems are often
highly nonsymmetric. Here, a novel convergence framework is developed for nonsymmetric, reduction-based
AMG, and sufficient conditions derived for $\ell^2$-convergence of error and residual. In particular,
classical multigrid approximation properties are connected with reduction-based measures to
develop a robust framework for nonsymmetric, reduction-based AMG. Matrices with block-triangular
structure are then recognized as being amenable to reduction-type algorithms, and a reduction-based
AMG method is developed for upwind discretizations of hyperbolic PDEs, based on the concept of a
Neumann approximation to ideal restriction ($n$AIR). $n$AIR can be seen as a variation of local
AIR ($\ell$AIR) introduced in previous work, specifically targeting matrices with triangular
structure. Although less versatile than $\ell$AIR, setup times for $n$AIR can be substantially
faster for problems with high connectivity. $n$AIR is shown to be an effective and scalable solver
of steady state transport for discontinuous, upwind discretizations, with unstructured meshes,
and up to 6th-order finite elements, offering a significant improvement over existing AMG methods.
$n$AIR is also shown to be effective on several classes of `nearly triangular' matrices, resulting
from curvilinear finite elements and artificial diffusion.
