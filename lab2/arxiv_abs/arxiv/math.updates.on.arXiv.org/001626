This paper considers a general stochastic resource allocation problem that arises widely in wireless
networks, cognitive radio, networks, smart-grid communications, and cross-layer design. The
problem formulation involves expectations with respect to a collection of random variables with
unknown distributions, representing exogenous quantities such as channel gain, user density,
or spectrum occupancy. We consider the constant step-size stochastic dual subgradient descent
(SDSD) method that has been widely used for online resource allocation in networks. The problem
is solved in dual domain which results in a primal resource allocation subproblem at each time instant.
The goal here is to characterize the non-asymptotic behavior of such stochastic resource allocations
in an almost sure sense. It is well known that with a step size of $\epsilon$, {SDSD} converges to an
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-sized neighborhood of the optimum. In practice however, there exists
a trade-off between the rate of convergence and the choice of $\epsilon$. This paper establishes
a convergence rate result for the SDSD algorithm that precisely characterizes this trade-off.
{Towards this end, a novel stochastic bound on the gap between the objective function and the optimum
is developed. The asymptotic behavior of the stochastic term is characterized in an almost sure
sense, thereby generalizing the existing results for the {stochastic subgradient} methods.}
For the stochastic resource allocation problem at hand, the result explicates the rate with which
the allocated resources become near-optimal. As an application, the power and user-allocation
problem in device-to-device networks is formulated and solved using the {SDSD} algorithm. Further
intuition on the rate results is obtained from the verification of the regularity conditions and
accompanying simulation results.
