We present modeling and analysis of day-ahead spatio-temporal energy markets in which each competitive
aggregator aims at making the highest profit by managing a complex mixture of different energy resources,
such as conventional generators, storage batteries, and uncertain renewable resources. First,
we develop an energy market model in terms of an adjustable robust convex program. This market modeling
is novel in the sense that the prosumption cost function of each aggregator, which evaluates the
cost to realize an amount of spatio-temporal energy prosumption, is a multi-variable function
resulting from a "parameterized" max-min program, in which the variable of the prosumption cost
function is involved as a continuous parameter and the variable of dispatchable resources is involved
as an adjustable variable for energy balance. This formulation enables to reasonably evaluate
a reward for intertemporal dispatchability enhancement and a penalty for renewable energy uncertainty
in a unified way. In addition, it enables to enforce a market regulation in which every aggregator
is responsible for absorbing his renewable energy uncertainty by managing his own dispatchable
energy resources. Second, in view of social economy as well as personal economy, we conduct a numerical
analysis on the premise of several photovoltaic penetration levels. In this numerical analysis,
we demonstrate that renewable generators do not always have priority of energy supply higher than
conventional generators due to their uncertainty and limited dispatchability, meaning that the
merit order of conventional and renewable generators can reverse. Furthermore, we analyze long-term
evolution of competitive energy markets demonstrating that there can be found a social equilibrium
of battery penetration levels, at which maximum personal profit with respect to battery system
enhancement is attained.
