Phase retrieval with prior information can be cast as a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem.
We solve the problem by graph projection splitting (GPS), where the two proximity subproblems and
the graph projection step can be solved efficiently. With slight modification, we also propose
a robust graph projection splitting (RGPS) method to stabilize the iteration for noisy measurements.
Contrary to intuition, RGPS outperforms GPS with fewer iterations to locate a satisfying solution
even for noiseless case. Based on the connection between GPS and Douglas-Rachford iteration, under
mild conditions on the sampling vectors, we analyze the fixed point sets and provide the local convergence
of GPS and RGPS applied to noiseless phase retrieval without prior information. For noisy case,
we provide the error bound of the reconstruction. Compared to other existing methods, thanks for
the splitting approach, GPS and RGPS can efficiently solve phase retrieval with prior information
regularization for general sampling vectors which are not necessarily isometric. For Gaussian
phase retrieval, compared to existing gradient flow approaches, numerical results show that GPS
and RGPS are much less sensitive to the initialization. Thus they markedly improve the phase transition
in noiseless case and reconstruction in the presence of noise respectively. GPS shows sharpest
phase transition among existing methods including RGPS, while it needs more iterations than RGPS
when the number of measurement is large enough. RGPS outperforms GPS in terms of stability for noisy
measurements. When applying RGPS to more general non-Gaussian measurements with prior information,
such as support, sparsity and TV minimization, RGPS either outperforms state-of-the-art solvers
or can be combined with state-of-the-art solvers to improve their reconstruction quality.
