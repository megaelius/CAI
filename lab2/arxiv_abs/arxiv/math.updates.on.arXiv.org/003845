Circadian rhythm is usually represented by the 24-hour biological cycles which are mainly driven
by the daily light-dark cycle on earth. Light stimulus is widely used as the control input of the circadian
system entrainment. In this paper, we study the light-based minimum-time circadian entrainment
problem of mammals, Neurospora, and Drosophila based on mathematical models of clock gene transcription.
These models contain 3 or even more nonlinear differential equations, and the optimal light control
of the entrainment problem on the full models is hard to solve directly. Two model simplification
methods are applied to multi-variable models: (1) the phase response curves(PRC) and the circadian
phase dynamics of these models are generated by impulse response simulation; (2) the Principal
Orthogonal Decomposition(POD) is performed to reduce these models to ones with merely two variables.
The minimum-time entrainment of the circadian phase is performed in a feedback form; the minimum-time
entrainment of the second-order model is treated as a two-point boundary valued problem(TPBVP),
which is solved by a direct shooting algorithm in terms of the Hamiltonian and Pontryagin Minimum
Principle. Eventually, the results in low-order models are used for initializing a gradient descent
algorithm, which is introduced in solving the entrainment problem of the full models. In this paper,
we present: (1) the application of PRC and direct shooting algorithm on multi-variable nonlinear
models; (2) a general process for solving the minimum-time optimal control problem on multi-variable
models; (3) the impacts of minimum-time optimal light on clock gene transcription and protein synthesis.
