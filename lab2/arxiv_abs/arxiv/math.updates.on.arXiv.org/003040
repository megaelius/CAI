We propose a many-body Hamiltonian construction which introduces a single separate energy scale
of order $\Theta(1/N^{2+\delta})$, for a small parameter $\delta>0$, and for $N$ terms in the target
Hamiltonian; in its low-energy subspace, we can approximate any normalized target Hamiltonian
$\mathbf H_\mathrm{t}=\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf h_i$ with norm ratios $r=\|\mathbf h_i\|_2 / \| \mathbf
h_j \|_2=O(\exp(\exp(\mathrm{poly}\,n)))$ to within relative precision $O(N^{-\delta})$.
This comes at the expense of increasing the locality of the target Hamiltonian by at most one, and
adding an at most poly-sized ancilliary system for each coupling; the ancillas being qutrits for
exponential scaling, and qudits for doubly exponential $r$; the interactions on the ancilliary
system are geometrically local, and can be translationally-invariant. In order to prove this claim,
we borrow a technique from high energy physics, and use a tiling Hamiltonian to drop all cross terms
at higher expansion orders, which simplifies the analysis of a traditional Feynman-Dyson series
expansion. As an application, we discuss implications for QMA-hardness of the Local Hamiltonian
problem, and argue that "almost" translational invariance - defined as arbitrarily small relative
variations of the strength of the local terms - is as good as non-translational-invariance in many
of the constructions used throughout Hamiltonian complexity theory. We furthermore show that
the choice of geared limit of many-body systems, where e.g. width and height of a lattice are taken
to infinity in a specific relation, can have different complexity-theoretic implications: even
for translationally-invariant models, changing the geared limit can vary the hardness of finding
the ground state energy with respect to a given promise gap from computationally trivial, to QMAEXP-,
or even BQEXPSPACE-complete.
