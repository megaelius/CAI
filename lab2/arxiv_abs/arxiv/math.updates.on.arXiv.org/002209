Two methods, structural (constructive) and multiplier (analytical), of exact enumeration of
undirected and directed circulant graphs of orders 27 and 125 are elaborated and represented in
detail here together with intermediate and final numerical data. The first method is based on the
known useful classification of circulant graphs in terms of $S$-rings and results in exhaustive
listing (with the use of COCO and GAP) of all corresponding $S$-rings of the indicated orders. The
latter method is conducted in the framework of a general approach developed earlier for counting
circulant graphs of prime-power orders. This approach is based on a familiar isomorphism criterion
for circulant graphs of such orders and on its subsequent adaptation to the enumeration in the Redfield--P\'olya
style. In particular, five intermediate enumeration subproblems arise, which are refined further
into eleven subproblems of this type (5 and 11 are not accidentally the 3d Catalan and 3d little Schr\"oder
numbers, resp.). All of them are resolved for the four cases under consideration (again with the
use of GAP). Except for the case of undirected circulant graphs of orders 27, the numerical results
obtained here are new. In particular the number (up to isomorphism) of directed circulant graphs
of orders 27, regardless of valency, is shown to be equal to 3,728,891 while 457 of these are self-complementary.
Some curious and rather unexpected identities are established between intermediate valency-specified
enumerators (both for undirected and directed circulant graphs) and their validity is conjectured
for arbitrary odd prime $p$. In general this research can be considered as, presumably, the crucial
step towards the explicit uniform enumeration formulae for circulant graphs of orders $p^3$ for
arbitrary prime $p>2$.
