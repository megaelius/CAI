We present a beamforming algorithm for multiuser wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) communication
systems where one access point uses hybrid analog/digital beamforming while multiple user stations
have phased-arrays with a single RF chain. The algorithm operates in a more general mode than others
available in literature and has lower computational complexity and training overhead. Throughout
the paper, we describe: i) the construction of novel beamformer sets (codebooks) with wide sector
beams and narrow beams based on the orthogonality property of beamformer vectors, ii) a beamforming
algorithm that uses training transmissions over the codebooks to select the beamformers that maximize
the received sumpower along the bandwidth, and iii) a numerical validation of the algorithm in standard
indoor scenarios for mmWave WLANs using channels obtained with both statistical and raytracing
models. Our algorithm is designed to serve multiple users in a wideband OFDM system and does not require
channel matrix knowledge or a particular channel structure. Moreover, we incorporate antenna-specific
aspects in the analysis, such as antenna coupling, element radiation pattern, and beam squint.
Although there are no other solutions for the general system studied in this paper, we characterize
the algorithm's achievable rate and show that it attains more than 70 percent of the spectral efficiency
(between 1.5 and 3 dB SNR loss) with respect to ideal fully-digital beamforming in the analyzed scenarios.
We also show that our algorithm has similar sum-rate performance as other solutions in the literature
for some special cases, while providing significantly lower computational complexity (with a
linear dependence on the number of antennas) and shorter training overhead.
