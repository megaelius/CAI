Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations
(BSDEs) are key ingredients in a number of models in physics and financial engineering. In particular,
parabolic PDEs and BSDEs are fundamental tools in the state-of-the-art pricing and hedging of financial
derivatives. The PDEs and BSDEs appearing in such applications are often high-dimensional and
nonlinear. Since explicit solutions of such PDEs and BSDEs are typically not available, it is a very
active topic of research to solve such PDEs and BSDEs approximately. In the recent article [E, W.,
Hutzenthaler, M., Jentzen, A., and Kruse, T. Linear scaling algorithms for solving high-dimensional
nonlinear parabolic differential equations. arXiv:1607.03295 (2017)] we proposed a family of
approximation methods based on Picard approximations and multilevel Monte Carlo methods and showed
under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution for semilinear heat equations that
the computational complexity is bounded by $O( d \, \epsilon^{-(4+\delta)})$ for any $\delta\in(0,\infty)$,
where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem and $\epsilon\in(0,\infty)$ is the prescribed accuracy.
In this paper, we test the applicability of this algorithm on a variety of $100$-dimensional nonlinear
PDEs that arise in physics and finance by means of numerical simulations presenting approximation
accuracy against runtime. The simulation results for these 100-dimensional example PDEs are very
satisfactory in terms of accuracy and speed. In addition, we also provide a review of other approximation
methods for nonlinear PDEs and BSDEs from the literature.
