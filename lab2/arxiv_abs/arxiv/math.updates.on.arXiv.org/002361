A logical proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem is one that relies only on the compatibility relations
amongst a set of projectors (called a KS set) rather than their statistics relative to some fixed
preparation. These compatibility relations can be abstractly represented by a contextuality
scenario. We introduce a framework for obtaining noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities
from contextuality scenarios that we will call KS-uncolourable scenarios. These include all those
that appear in logical proofs of the KS theorem. Our approach here goes beyond the result of R. Kunjwal
and R. W. Spekkens, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 110403 (2015), which relied on an explicit numerical enumeration
of all the vertices of the polytope of (measurement) noncontextual assignments of probabilities
to such a KS-uncolourable contextuality scenario. In particular, this work forms a necessary counterpart
to the framework for noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities presented in R. Kunjwal, arXiv:1709.01098
[quant-ph] (2017), which only applies to KS-colourable contextuality scenarios. The framework
we present here relies on a single hypergraph invariant, defined in R. Kunjwal, arXiv:1709.01098
[quant-ph] (2017), that is relevant for noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities arising
from any KS-uncolourable contextuality scenario, namely, the weighted max-predictability.
Indeed, the present work can also be viewed as a study of this hypergraph invariant. Significantly,
none of the graph invariants arising in the graph-theoretic framework for KS contextuality due
to Cabello, Severini, and Winter (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 040401 (2014)) are relevant for our noise-robust
noncontextuality inequalities. In this sense, the framework we present for generalized contextuality
applied to KS-uncolourable scenarios has no analogue in previous literature on KS-contextuality.
