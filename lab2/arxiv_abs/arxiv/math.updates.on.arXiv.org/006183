Here we prove a global existence theorem for sufficiently small however fully nonlinear perturbations
of a family of background solutions of the $`n+1$' vacuum Einstein equations in the presence of a
positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. With the advent of dark energy driven accelerated expansion
of the universe, it is of fundamental importance in mathematical cosmology to include a positive
cosmological constant, the simplest form of the dark energy in the vacuum Einstein equations. Such
Einsteinian evolution is here designated as the `Einstein-$\Lambda$' flow. We study the background
solutions of this `Einstein-$\Lambda$' flow in $`n+1$' dimensional spacetimes in constant mean
curvature spatial harmonic gauge, $n\geq3$ and establish both linear and non-linear stability
of such solutions. In the cases of number of spatial dimensions being strictly greater than $3$,
the finite dimensional Einstein muduli spaces form the center manifold of the dynamics. A suitable
shadow gauge condition \cite{andersson2011einstein} is implemented in order to treat these cases.
In addition, the autonomous character of the suitably re-scaled Einstein flow breaks down as a consequence
of including $\Lambda(>0)$. We construct a Lyapunov function (controlling a suitable norm of the
small data) similar to a wave equation type energy for the non-linear non-autonomous evolution
of the small data and prove its decay in the direction of cosmological expansion. Our results demonstrate
the future stability and geodesic completeness of the perturbed spacetimes, and show that the scale-free
geometry converges to an element of the Einstein moduli space (a point for $n=3$ and a finite dimensional
space for $n>3$), which has significant consequence for the cosmic topology while restricting
to the case of $n=3$.
