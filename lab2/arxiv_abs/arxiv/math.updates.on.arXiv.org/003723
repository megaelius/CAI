Constrained Markov processes, such as reflecting diffusions, behave as an unconstrained process
in the interior of a domain but upon reaching the boundary are controlled in some way so that they do
not leave the closure of the domain. In this paper, the behavior in the interior is specified by a generator
of a Markov process, and the constraints are specified by a controlled generator. Together, the
generators define a {\em constrained martingale problem}. The desired constrained processes
are constructed by first solving a simpler {\em controlled martingale problem\/} and then obtaining
the desired process as a time-change of the controlled process. As for ordinary martingale problems,
it is rarely obvious that the process constructed in this manner is unique. The primary goal of the
paper is to show that from among the processes constructed in this way one can "select", in the sense
of Krylov, a Markov process. Corollaries to these constructions include the observation that uniqueness
among Markov solutions implies uniqueness among all solutions. These results provide useful tools
for proving uniqueness for constrained processes including reflecting diffusions. The constructions
also yield viscosity semisolutions of the resolvent equation and, if uniqueness holds, a viscosity
solution, without proving a comparison principle. We illustrate our results with reflecting diffusions
under the assumption that at each point of the boundary there is a vector that has strictly positive
inner product with all the admissable directions of reflection. We also indicate how the results
can be applied to processes with Wentzell boundary conditions and nonlocal boundary conditions.
