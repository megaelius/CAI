This paper develops boundary feedback control laws in order to damp out traffic oscillations in
the congested regime of the linearized two-class Aw-Rascle (AR) traffic model. The macroscopic
second-order two-class AR traffic model consists of four hyperbolic partial differential equations
(PDEs) describing the dynamics of densities and velocities on freeway. The concept of area occupancy
is used to express the traffic pressure and equilibrium speed relationship yielding a coupling
between the two classes of vehicles. Each vehicle class is characterized by its own vehicle size
and driver's behavior. The considered equilibrium profiles of the model represent evenly distributed
traffic with constant densities and velocities of both classes along the investigated track section.
After linearizing the model equations around those equilibrium profiles, it is observed that in
the congested traffic one of the four characteristic speeds is negative, whereas the remaining
three are positive. Backstepping control design is employed to stabilize the $4 \times 4$ heterodirectional
hyperbolic PDEs. The control input actuates the traffic flow at outlet of the investigated track
section and is realized by a ramp metering. A full-state feedback is designed to achieve finite time
convergence of the density and velocity perturbations to the equilibrium at zero. This result is
then combined with an anti-collocated observer design in order to construct an output feedback
control law that damps out stop-and-go waves in finite time by measuring the velocities and densities
of both vehicle classes at the inlet of the investigated track section. The performance of the developed
controllers is verified by simulation.
