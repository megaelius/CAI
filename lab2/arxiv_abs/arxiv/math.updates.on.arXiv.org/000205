Certain one-dimensional nearest-neighbor random walks in i.i.d. random space-time environments
are known to have diffusive scaling limits. In the continuum limit, the random environment is represented
by a `stochastic flow of kernels', which is a collection of random kernels that can be loosely interpreted
as the transition probabilities of a Markov process in a random environment. The theory of stochastic
flows of kernels was introduced by Le Jan and Raimond, who showed that each such flow is characterized
by its n-point motions. We focus on a class of stochastic flows of kernels with Brownian n-point motions
which, after their inventors, will be called Howitt-Warren flows. We give a graphical construction
of general Howitt-Warren flows, where the underlying random environment takes on the form of a suitably
marked Brownian web. Alternatively, we show that a special subclass of the Howitt-Warren flows
can be constructed as random flows of mass in a Brownian net. Using these constructions, we prove
some new results for the Howitt-Warren flows. In particular, we show that the kernels spread with
a finite speed and have a locally finite support at deterministic times if and only if the flow is embeddable
in a Brownian net. We show that the kernels are always purely atomic at deterministic times, but with
the exception of a special subclass known as the erosion flows, exhibit random times when the kernels
are purely non-atomic. We moreover prove ergodic statements for a class of measure-valued processes
induced by the Howitt-Warren flows. Along the way, we also prove some new results for the Brownian
web and net.
