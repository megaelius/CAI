Every regular N-gon generates a canonical family of regular polygons which are conforming to the
bounds of the 'star polygons' determined by N. These star polygons are formed from truncated extended
edges of the N-gon and the intersection points ('star' points) determine a scaling which defines
the parameters of the family. In 'First Families of Regular Polygons' (arXiv:1503.05536) we showed
that this scaling forms a basis for the maximal real subfield of the cyclotomic field of N. The traditional
generator for this subfield is 2cos(2Pi/N) so it has order Phi(N)/2 where Phi is the Euler totient
function. This order is known as the 'algebraic complexity' of N. The family of regular polygons
shares this same scaling and complexity, so members of this family are an intrinsic part of any regular
polygon - and we call them the First Family of N. Here we start from first principles and give an algebraic
derivation of the First Families showing how each star[k] point of N defines a scale[k] and also an
S[k] 'tile' of the family. Under a piecewise isometry such as the outer-billiards map the 'singularity
set' W can be formed by iterating the extended edges of N and we show that W can be reduced to a 'shear
and rotation' which preserves the S[k], so the 'web' W can be regarded as the disjoint union (coproduct)
of the local webs of the S[k]. These local webs are still very complex but we show in Lemma 4.1 that the
center of each S[k] has a constant step-k orbit around N. These 'resonant' orbits set bounds on global
orbits and establish a connection between geometry and dynamics. For the first time it is possible
to make predictions about the small-scale geometry of the S[1] and S[2] tiles on the edges of N and
give a plausible explanation for the long-standing '4k+1' conjecture of arXiv:1311.6763 about
extended families of tiles when N = 8k+2. Each 8k+j family has unique edge geometry.
