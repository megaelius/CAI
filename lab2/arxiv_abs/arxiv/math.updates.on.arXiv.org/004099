We study singular contact structures, which are tangent to a given smooth hypersurface $Z$ and satisfy
certain transversality conditions. These singular contact structures are determined by the kernel
of non-smooth differential forms, called $b^m$-contact forms having an associated critical hypersurface
$Z$. This article has three parts. In the first part we provide several constructions, prove local
normal forms and study the induced structure on the critical hypersurface. In the second part we
tackle the problem of existence of $b^m$-contact structures on a given manifold. We prove that a
connected component of a convex hypersurface of a contact manifold can be realized as a connected
component of the critical set of a $b^m$-contact structure. In particular, in the $3$-dimensional
case, this construction yields the existence of a generic set of surfaces $Z$ such that the pair $(M,Z)$
is a $b^{2k}$-contact manifold and $Z$ is its critical hypersurface. The third part of this article
is focused on the Reeb dynamics associated to those manifolds. Contrary to the initial expectations,
a counterexample to the regular Weinstein conjecture on periodic orbits is given using plugs and
we construct examples of $b^m$-symplectic manifolds endowed with proper Hamiltonian function
without periodic orbits on all level-sets. This counterexample to the Weinstein conjecture suggests
to extend the notion of periodic orbits and generalize Weinstein conjecture by including the so-called
singular periodic orbits leading to a reformulation of a singular Weinstein conjecture in this
scenario. We end up this article pointing to an extension of the Floer machinery to the singular set-up
where we are naturally drifted by the results above.
