Our main result is that any topological algebra based on a Boolean space is the extended Stone dual
space of a certain associated Boolean algebra with additional operations. A particular case of
this result is that the profinite completion of any abstract algebra is the extended Stone dual space
of the Boolean algebra of recognizable subsets of the abstract algebra endowed with certain residuation
operations. These results identify a connection between topological algebra as applied in algebra
and Stone duality as applied in logic, and show that the notion of recognition originating in computer
science is intrinsic to profinite completion in mathematics in general. This connection underlies
a number of recent results in automata theory including a generalization of Eilenberg-Reiterman
theory for regular languages and a new notion of compact recognition applying beyond the setting
of regular languages. The purpose of this paper is to give the underlying duality theoretic result
in its general form. Further we illustrate the power of the result by providing a few applications
in topological algebra and language theory. In particular, we give a simple proof of the fact that
any topological algebra quotient of a profinite algebra which is again based on a Boolean space is
in fact a profinite algebra and we derive the conditions dual to the ones of the original Eilenberg
theorem in a fully modular manner. We cast our results in the setting of extended Priestley duality
for distributive lattices with additional operations as some classes of languages of interest
in automata fail to be closed under complementation.
