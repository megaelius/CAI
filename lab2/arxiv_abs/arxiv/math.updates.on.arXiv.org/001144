The plant hormones brassinosteroid (BR) and gibberellin (GA) have important roles in a wide range
of processes involved in plant growth and development. In this paper we derive and analyse new mathematical
models for the BR signalling pathway and for the crosstalk between the BR and GA signalling pathways.
To analyse the effects of spatial heterogeneity of the signalling processes, along with spatially-homogeneous
ODE models we derive coupled PDE-ODE systems modelling the temporal and spatial dynamics of molecules
involved in the signalling pathways. The values of the parameters in the model for the BR signalling
pathway are determined using experimental data on the gene expression of BR biosynthetic enzymes.
The stability of steady state solutions of our mathematical model, shown for a wide range of parameters,
can be related to the BR homeostasis. Our results for the crosstalk model suggest that the interaction
between transcription factors BZR and DELLA exerts more influence on the dynamics of the signalling
pathways than BZR-mediated biosynthesis of GA, suggesting that the interaction between transcription
factors may constitute the principal mechanism of the crosstalk between the BR and GA signalling
pathways. In general, perturbations in the GA signalling pathway have larger effects on the dynamics
of components of the BR signalling pathway than perturbations in the BR signalling pathway on the
dynamics of the GA pathway. The perturbation in the crosstalk mechanism also has a larger effect
on the dynamics of the BR pathway than of the GA pathway. Large changes in the dynamics of the GA signalling
processes can be observed only in the case where there are disturbances in both the BR signalling
pathway and the crosstalk mechanism.
