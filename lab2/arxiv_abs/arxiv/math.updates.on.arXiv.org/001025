In this paper, we consider a wireless powered communication system, where an energy harvesting
(EH) node harvests energy from a radio frequency (RF) signal broadcasted by an access point (AP)
in the downlink (DL). The node stores the harvested energy in an energy buffer and uses the stored
energy to transmit data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We investigate two simple online transmission
policies for the EH node, namely a best-effort policy and an on-off policy, which do not require knowledge
of the EH profile nor channel knowledge. In particular, for both policies, the EH node transmits
in each time slot with a constant desired power if sufficient energy is available in its energy buffer.
Otherwise, the node transmits with the maximum possible power in the best-effort policy and remains
silent in the on-off policy. For both policies, we use the theory of discrete-time continuous-state
Markov chains to analyze the limiting distribution of the stored energy for finite- and infinite-size
energy buffers. We provide this limiting distribution in closed form for a Nakagami-m fading DL
channel and analyze the outage probability for a Nakagami-m fading UL channel. All derived analytical
results are not limited to EH via RF WPT but are applicable for any independent and identically distributed
EH process, originating from e.g. solar and wind energy. Our results reveal that, for low outage
probabilities, the best-effort policy is superior to the on-off policy and the optimal constant
UL transmit power of the EH node that minimizes the outage probability is always less than the average
harvested power but increases with the capacity of the energy buffer. The opposite behaviour is
observed for high outage probabilities. Furthermore, we show that the minimum outage probability
among both proposed policies closely approaches the outage probability of the optimal offline
power allocation policy.
