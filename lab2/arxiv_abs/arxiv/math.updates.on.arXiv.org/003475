In this paper, we investigate iterative methods that are based on sampling of the data for computing
Tikhonov-regularized solutions. We focus on very large inverse problems where access to the entire
data set is not possible all at once (e.g., for problems with streaming or massive datasets). Row-access
methods provide an ideal framework for solving such problems, since they only require access to
"blocks" of the data at any given time. However, when using these iterative sampling methods to solve
inverse problems, the main challenges include a proper choice of the regularization parameter,
appropriate sampling strategies, and a convergence analysis. To address these challenges, we
first describe a family of sampled iterative methods that can incorporate data as they become available
(e.g., randomly sampled). We consider two sampled iterative methods, where the iterates can be
characterized as solutions to a sequence of approximate Tikhonov problems. The first method requires
the regularization parameter to be fixed a priori and converges asymptotically to an unregularized
solution for randomly sampled data. This is undesirable for inverse problems. Thus, we focus on
the second method where the main benefits are that the regularization parameter can be updated during
the iterative process and the iterates converge asymptotically to a Tikhonov-regularized solution.
We describe adaptive approaches to update the regularization parameter that are based on sampled
residuals, and we describe a limited-memory variant for larger problems. Numerical examples,
including a large-scale super-resolution imaging example, demonstrate the potential for these
methods.
