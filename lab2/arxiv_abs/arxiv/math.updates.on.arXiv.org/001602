For uncertainty propagation of highly complex and/or nonlinear problems, one must resort to sample-based
non-intrusive approaches [1]. In such cases, minimizing the number of function evaluations required
to evaluate the response surface is of paramount importance. Sparse grid approaches have proven
effective in reducing the number of sample evaluations. For example, the discrete projection collocation
method has the notable feature of exhibiting fast convergence rates when approximating smooth
functions; however, it lacks the ability to accurately and efficiently track response functions
that exhibit fluctuations, abrupt changes or discontinuities in very localized regions of the
input domain. On the other hand, the piecewise linear collocation interpolation approach can track
these localized variations in the response surface efficiently, but it converges slowly in the
smooth regions. The proposed methodology, building on an existing work on adaptive hierarchical
sparse grid collocation algorithm [2], is able to track localized behavior while also avoiding
unnecessary function evaluations in smoother regions of the stochastic space by using a finite
difference based one-dimensional derivative evaluation technique in all the dimensions. This
derivative evaluation technique leads to faster convergence in the smoother regions than what
is achieved in the existing collocation interpolation approaches. Illustrative examples show
that this method is well suited to high-dimensional stochastic problems, and that stochastic elliptic
problems with stochastic dimension as high as 100 can be dealt with effectively.
