Two methods, structural (constructive) and multiplier (analytical), of exact enumeration of
undirected and directed circulant graphs of orders 27 and 125 are elaborated and represented in
detail here together with intermediate and final numerical data. The first method is based on the
known useful classification of circulant graphs in terms of $S$-rings and results in exhaustive
listing (with the use of COCO and GAP) of all corresponding $S$-rings of the indicated orders. The
latter method is conducted in the framework of a general approach developed earlier for counting
circulant graphs of prime-power orders. It is a Redfield--P\'olya type of enumeration based on
an isomorphism criterion for circulant graphs of such orders. In particular, five intermediate
enumeration subproblems arise, which are refined further into eleven subproblems of this type
(5 and 11 are, not accidentally, the 3d Catalan and 3d little Schr\"oder numbers, resp.). All of them
are resolved for the four cases under consideration (again with the use of GAP). We give a brief survey
of some background theory of the results which form the basis of our computational approach. Except
for the case of undirected circulant graphs of orders 27, the numerical results obtained here are
new. In particular the number (up to isomorphism) of directed circulant graphs of orders 27, regardless
of valency, is shown to be equal to 3,728,891 while 457 of these are self-complementary. Some curious
and rather unexpected identities are established between intermediate valency-specified enumerators
(both for undirected and directed circulant graphs) and their validity is conjectured for arbitrary
cubed odd prime $p^3$. We believe that this research can serve as the crucial step towards explicit
uniform enumeration formulae for circulant graphs of orders $p^3$ for arbitrary prime $p>2$.
