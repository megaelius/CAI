Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs and a positive integer $k$, a graph $G$ is called vertex $k$-fault-tolerant
with respect to $\mathcal{H}$, denoted by $k$-FT$(\mathcal{H})$, if $G-S$ contains some $H\in\mathcal{H}$
as a subgraph, for every $S\subset V(G)$ with $|S|\leq k$. Vertex-fault-tolerance has been introduced
by Hayes [{\em A graph model for fault-tolerant computing systems}, IEEE Transactions on Computers,
C-25 (1976), pp. 875-884.], and has been studied in view of potential applications in the design
of interconnection networks operating correctly in the presence of faults. We study the problem
of minimum $k$-critical bipartite graph of order $(n,m)$: to find a bipartite $G=(U,V;E)$, with
$|U|=n$, $|V|=m$, $n>m>1$, that is $k$-critical bipartite, $|E|$ is minimum, and the tuple $(\Delta_U,
\Delta_V)$, where $\Delta_U$ and $\Delta_V$ are the maximum degree in $U$ and $V$, respectively,
is lexicographically minimum. $G$ is $k$-critical bipartite if deleting at most $k=n-m$ vertices
from $U$ creates $G'$ that has a complete matching, i.e., a matching of size $m$. We show that, if $m(n-m+1)/n$
is integer, solutions of the minimum $k$-critical bipartite graph problem can be found among $(a,b)$-regular
bipartite graphs of order $(n,m)$, with $a=m(n-m+1)/n$, and $b=n-m+1$. If $a=m-1$ then all $(a,b)$-regular
bipartite graphs of order $(n,m)$ are $k$-critical bipartite, and for $a<m-1$, it is not the case.
We characterize the values of $n$, $m$, $a$, and $b$ that admit an $(a,b)$-regular bipartite graph
of order $(n,m)$, with $b=n-m+1$, and give a simple construction that creates such a $k$-critical
bipartite graph whenever possible. Our techniques are based on Hall's marriage theorem, elementary
number theory, linear Diophantine equations, properties of integer functions and congruences,
and equations involving them.
