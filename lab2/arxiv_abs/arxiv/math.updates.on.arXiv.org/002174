The phenomenon of intransitivity in elections, where the pairwise orderings of three or more candidates
induced by voter preference is not transitive, was first observed by Condorcet in the 18th century,
and is fundamental to modern social choice theory. There has been some recent interest in understanding
intransitivity for three or more $n$-sided dice (with non-standard labelings), where now the pairwise
ordering is induced by the probability, relative to $1/2$, that a throw from one dice is higher than
the other. Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu and Morrison studied, via simulation, the probability of
intransitivity for a number of random dice models. Their findings led to a Polymath project studying
three i.i.d. random dice with i.i.d. faces drawn from the uniform distribution on $\{1,\ldots,n\}$,
and conditioned on the average of faces equal to $(n+1)/2$. The Polymath project proved that the
probability that three such dice are intransitive is asymptotically $1/4$. The analogous probability
in the Condorcet voting model is known to be different than $1/4$ (it is approximately equal to $0.0877$).
We present some results concerning intransitive dice and Condorcet paradox. Among others, we show
that if we replace the uniform dice faces by Gaussian faces, i.e., faces drawn from the standard normal
distribution conditioned on the average of faces equal to zero, then three dice are transitive with
high probability, in contrast to the behavior of the uniform model. We also define a notion of almost
tied elections in the standard social choice voting model and show that the probability of Condorcet
paradox for those elections approaches $1/4$.
