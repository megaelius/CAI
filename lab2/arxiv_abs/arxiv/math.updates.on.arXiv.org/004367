In many jurisdictions, the recent wave of rooftop PV investment compromised the equity of network
cost allocations across retail electricity customer classes, in part due to poorly designed network,
retail and feed-in tariffs. Currently, a new wave of investment in distributed energy resource
(DER), such as residential batteries and home energy management systems, is unfurling and with
it so does the risk of repeating the same tariff design mistakes. As such, distribution network service
providers need improved tools for crafting DER-specific tariffs. These tools will guide the design
of tariffs that minimize DER impacts on network performance, stabilize network company revenue,
and improve the equity of network costs across the customer base. Within this context, this paper
proposes a probabilistic framework to assess the impacts of different network tariffs on the consumption
pattern of electricity consumers with flexible DER, such as thermostatically controlled loads
and battery storage. The assessment tool comprises randomly-generated synthetic load and PV generation
traces, which are fed into a mixed integer linear programming-based home energy management system
to schedule residential customers' controllable devices connected to a low voltage network. Customer
net loads are then used in low voltage power flow studies to assess the network effects of various
tariff designs. In this work, assessments are made of energy- and demand-based tariffs. Simulation
results show that flat tariffs with a peak demand component perform best in terms of electricity
cost reduction for the customer, as well as in mitigating the level of binding network constraints.
This demonstrates how the assessment tool can be used by distribution network service providers
and regulators to develop tariffs that are beneficial for networks that play host to growing numbers
of PV-battery systems and other DER.
