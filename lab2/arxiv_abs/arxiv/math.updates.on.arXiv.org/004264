We study an interacting particle system, motivated by a simple random access protocol in wireless
systems. There are $\rho n$ particles, $\rho < 1$, moving clockwise, in discrete time, on $n$ cites
arranged in a circle. A "free" particle, with no neighbors on either side, certainly moves forward
in a slot. A particle with another one immediately in front of it, does not move. A particle which has
an empty site in front, but another particle immediately behind, moves forward with probability
$0<p<1$. (We refer to the latter as a "holdback" property.) From the point of view of holes (empty
sites) moving counter-clockwise, this is a zero-range process. The main question we address is:
what is the system flux (or current, or throughput) when $n$ is large, as a function of density $\rho$?
The most interesting range of densities is $0\le \rho < 1/2$. We define the system {\em typical flux}
as the limit of the flux in a system with random perturbations, when the perturbations' rate vanishes.
Our main results show that (a) the typical flux is different from the formal flux for the basic system
(without perturbations), and (b) the process experiences a phase transition at density $h=p/(1+p)$.
If $\rho<h$, the typical flux is equal to $\rho$, which coincides with the formal flux. If $\rho>h$,
a {\em condensation} occurs, which results in the formation of large particle clusters; in particular,
the typical flux in this case is $p(1-\rho) < h < \rho$. Our results include both the steady-state
limits (which determine the typical flux) and the transient analysis. In particular, we show that
the key "reason" for large cluster formation for densities $\rho > h$ is described by a version of
the Ballot Theorem.
