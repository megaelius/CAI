Given a large sample covariance matrix$S\_N=\frac 1n\Gamma\_N^{1/2}Z\_N Z\_N^*\Gamma\_N^{1/2}\,
,$where $Z\_N$ is a $N\times n$ matrix with i.i.d. centered entries, and $\Gamma\_N$ is a $N\times
N$ deterministic Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix, we study the location and fluctuations
of $\lambda\_{\max}(S\_N)$, the largest eigenvalue of $S\_N$ as $N,n\to\infty$ and $Nn^{-1}
\to r\in(0,\infty)$ in the case where the empirical distribution $\mu^{\Gamma\_N}$ of eigenvalues
of $\Gamma\_N$ is tight (in $N$) and $\lambda\_{\max}(\Gamma\_N)$ goes to $+\infty$. These conditions
are in particular met when $\mu^{\Gamma\_N}$ weakly converges to a probability measure with unbounded
support on $\mathbb{R}^+$. We prove that asymptotically $\lambda\_{\max}(S\_N)\sim \lambda\_{\max}(\Gamma\_N)$.
Moreover when the $\Gamma\_N$'s are block-diagonal, and the following {\em spectral gap condition}
is assumed:$$\limsup\_{N\to\infty} \frac{\lambda\_2(\Gamma\_N)}{\lambda\_{\max}(\Gamma\_N)}<1,$$where
$\lambda\_2(\Gamma\_N)$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma\_N$, we prove Gaussian fluctuations
for $\lambda\_{\max}(S\_N)/\lambda\_{\max}(\Gamma\_N)$ at the scale $\sqrt{n}$.In the particular
case where $Z\_N$ has i.i.d. Gaussian entries and $\Gamma\_N$ is the $N\times N$ autocovariance
matrix of a long memory Gaussian stationary process $({\mathcal X}\_t)\_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$,
the columns of $\Gamma\_N^{1/2} Z\_N$ can be considered as $n$ i.i.d. samples of the random vector
$({\mathcal X}\_1,\dots,{\mathcal X}\_N)^\tran$. We then prove that $\Gamma\_N$ is similar
to a diagonal matrix which satisfies all the required assumptions of our theorems, hence our results
apply to this case.
