Computation of electromagnetic fields due to point sources (Hertzian dipoles) in cylindrically
stratified media is a classical problem for which analytical expressions of the associated tensor
Green's function have been long known. However, under finite-precision arithmetic, direct numerical
computations based on the application of such analytical (canonical) expressions invariably
lead to underflow and overflow problems related to the poor scaling of the eigenfunctions (cylindrical
Bessel and Hankel functions) for extreme arguments and/or high-order, as well as convergence problems
related to the numerical integration over the spectral wavenumber and to the truncation of the infinite
series over the azimuth mode number. These problems are exacerbated when a disparate range of values
is to be considered for the layers' thicknesses and material properties (resistivities, permittivities,
and permeabilities), the transverse and longitudinal distances between source and observation
points, as well as the source frequency. To overcome these challenges in a systematic fashion, we
introduce herein different sets of range-conditioned, modified cylindrical functions (in lieu
of standard cylindrical eigenfunctions), each associated with non-overlapped subdomains of
(numerical) evaluation to allow for stable computations under any range of physical parameters.
In addition adaptively-chosen integration contours are employed in the complex spectral wavenumber
plane to ensure convergent numerical integration in all cases. We illustrate the application of
the algorithm to problems of geophysical interest involving layer resistivities ranging from
1000 $\Omega \cdot$m to 10$^{-8} \Omega \cdot$m, frequencies of operation ranging from 10 MHz down
to the low magnetotelluric range of 0.01 Hz, and for various combinations of layer thicknesses.
