Estimating symmetric properties of a distribution, e.g. support size, coverage, entropy, distance
to uniformity, are among the most fundamental problems in algorithmic statistics. While each of
these properties have been studied extensively and separate optimal estimators are known for each,
in striking recent work, Acharya et al. 2016 showed that there is a single estimator that is competitive
for all symmetric properties. This work proved that computing the distribution that approximately
maximizes \emph{profile likelihood (PML)}, i.e. the probability of observed frequency of frequencies,
and returning the value of the property on this distribution is sample competitive with respect
to a broad class of estimators of symmetric properties. Further, they showed that even computing
an approximation of the PML suffices to achieve such a universal plug-in estimator. Unfortunately,
prior to this work there was no known polynomial time algorithm to compute an approximate PML and
it was open to obtain a polynomial time universal plug-in estimator through the use of approximate
PML. In this paper we provide a algorithm (in number of samples) that, given $n$ samples from a distribution,
computes an approximate PML distribution up to a multiplicative error of $\exp(n^{2/3} \mathrm{poly}
\log(n))$ in time nearly linear in $n$. Generalizing work of Acharya et al. 2016 on the utility of
approximate PML we show that our algorithm provides a nearly linear time universal plug-in estimator
for all symmetric functions up to accuracy $\epsilon = \Omega(n^{-0.166})$. Further, we show how
to extend our work to provide efficient polynomial-time algorithms for computing a $d$-dimensional
generalization of PML (for constant $d$) that allows for universal plug-in estimation of symmetric
relationships between distributions.
