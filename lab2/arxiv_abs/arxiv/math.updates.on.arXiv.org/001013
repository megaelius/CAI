This paper focuses on the design of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in a classical two-transmitter
two-receiver Z-channel, wherein one transmitter sends information to its intended receiver from
the direct link while the other transmitter sends information to both receivers from the direct
and cross links. Unlike most existing designs using (continuous) Gaussian input distribution,
we consider the practical finite-alphabet (i.e., discrete) inputs by assuming that the widely-used
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations are adopted by both transmitters. To balance
the error performance of two receivers, we apply the max-min fairness design criterion in this paper.
More specifically, we propose to jointly optimize the scaling factors at both transmitters, which
control the minimum Euclidean distance of transmitting constellations, to maximize the smaller
minimum Euclidean distance of two resulting constellations at the receivers, subject to an individual
average power constraint at each transmitter. The formulated problem is a mixed continuous-discrete
optimization problem and is thus intractable in general. By resorting to the Farey sequence, we
manage to attain the closed-form expression for the optimal solution to the formulated problem.
This is achieved by dividing the overall feasible region of the original optimization problem into
a finite number of sub-intervals and deriving the optimal solution in each sub-interval. Through
carefully observing the structure of the optimal solutions in all sub-intervals, we obtain compact
and closed-form expressions for the optimal solutions to the original problem in three possible
scenarios defined by the relative strength of the cross link. Simulation studies are provided to
validate our analysis and demonstrate the merits of the proposed design over existing orthogonal
or non-orthogonal schemes.
