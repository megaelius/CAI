This paper studies data-driven distributionally robust bottleneck combinatorial problems (DRBCP)
with stochastic costs, where the probability distribution of the cost vector is contained in a ball
of distributions centered at the empirical distribution specified by the Wasserstein distance.
We study two distinct versions of DRBCP from different applications: (i) Motivated by the multi-hop
wireless network application, we first study the uncertainty quantification of DRBCP (denoted
by DRBCP-U), where decision-makers would like to have an accurate estimation of the worst-case
value of DRBCP. The difficulty of DRBCP-U is to handle its max-min-max form. Fortunately, the alternative
forms of the bottleneck combinatorial problems from their blockers allow us to derive equivalent
deterministic reformulations, which can be computed via mixed-integer programs. In addition,
by drawing the connection between DRBCP-U and its sampling average approximation counterpart
under empirical distribution, we show that the Wasserstein radius can be chosen in the order of negative
square root of sample size, improving the existing known results; and (ii) Next, motivated by the
ride-sharing application, decision-makers choose the best service-and-passenger matching
that minimizes the unfairness. This gives rise to the decision-making DRBCP (denoted by DRBCP-D).
For DRBCP-D, we show that its optimal solution is also optimal to its sampling average approximation
counterpart, and the Wasserstein radius can be chosen in a similar order as DRBCP-U. When the sample
size is small, we propose to use the optimal value of DRBCP-D to construct an indifferent solution
space and propose an alternative decision-robust model, which finds the best indifferent solution
to minimize the empirical variance. We further show that the decision robust model can be recast
as a mixed-integer program.
