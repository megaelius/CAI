The recent development of parallel technologies on modern desktop computers makes parallelization
of the proposed numerical approaches a priority in algorithmic research. The main performance
improvement in the upcoming years will be made based on the increasing number of cores on modern CPUs.
This shifts the focus of the algorithmic research from the development of the sequential numerical
methods to the parallel methodology. In this paper, we present an efficient parallel direct algorithm
for the compact high-order approximation of the 3D Helmholtz equation. The developed method is
based on a combination of the separation of variables technique and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
type method. The results of the implementation of this method in OpenMP, MPI and Hybrid programming
environments on the multicores computers and multiple node clusters are presented. We considered
a generalization of the presented algorithm to the solution of linear systems obtained from approximation
on the compact 27-point 3D stencils on the rectangular grids with similar stencil coefficients.
As an example of the diversity of applications, the direct parallel implementation of a compact
fourth-order approximation scheme for a convection-diffusion equation is considered. The developed
parallel algorithms present efficient direct solvers for many important applications, but they
can be used as highly efficient preconditioners for a variety of iterative numerical methods in
more general settings. In many situations, the efficiency of the iterative algorithms is determined
by the robustness of the preconditioning technique, the presented methods have a wide range of applications.
In this paper, we demonstrate the scalability of the developed numerical algorithms on a series
of representative test problems.
