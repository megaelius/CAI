The main purpose of this work is to characterize derivations through functional equations. This
work consists of five chapters. In the first one, we summarize the most important notions and results
from the theory of functional equations. In Chapter 2 we collect all the definitions and results
regarding derivations that are essential while studying this area. In Chapter 3 we intend to show
that derivations can be characterized by one single functional equation. More exactly, we study
here the following problem. Let $Q$ be a commutative ring and let $P$ be a subring of $Q$. Let $\lambda,
\mu\in Q\setminus\left\{0\right\}$ be arbitrary, $f\colon P\rightarrow Q$ be a function and
consider the equation \[ \lambda\left[f(x+y)-f(x)-f(y)\right]+ \mu\left[f(xy)-xf(y)-yf(x)\right]=0
\quad \left(x, y\in P\right). \] In this chapter it will be proved that under some assumptions on
the rings $P$ and $Q$, derivations can be characterized via the above equation. Chapter 4 is devoted
to the additive solvability of a system of functional equations. Moreover, the linear dependence
and independence of the additive solutions $d_{0},d_{1},\dots,d_{n} \colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
of the above system of equations is characterized. Finally, the closing chapter deals with the following
problem. Assume that $\xi\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a given differentiable function
and for the additive function $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, the mapping \[ \varphi(x)=f\left(\xi(x)\right)-\xi'(x)f(x)
\] fulfills some regularity condition on its domain. Is it true that in such a case $f$ is a sum of a derivation
and a linear function?
