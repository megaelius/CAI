We determine the behavior of multiplicative functions vanishing at a positive proportion of prime
numbers in almost all short intervals. Furthermore we quantify "almost all" with uniform power-saving
upper bounds, that is, we save a power of the suitably normalized length of the interval regardless
of how long or short the interval is. Such power-saving bounds are new even in the special case of the
M\"obius function. These general results are motivated by several applications. First, we strengthen
work of Hooley on sums of two squares by establishing an asymptotic for the number of integers that
are sums of two squares in almost all short intervals. Previously only the order of magnitude was
known. Secondly, we extend this result to general norm forms of an arbitrary number field $K$ (sums
of two squares are norm-forms of $\mathbb{Q}(i)$). Thirdly, Hooley determined the order of magnitude
of the sum of $(s_{n + 1} - s_{n})^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \in (1, 5/3)$ where $s_{1} < s_2 < \ldots$
denote integers representable as sums of two squares. We establish a similar results with $\gamma
\in (1, 3/2)$ and $s_n$ the sequence of integers representable as norm-forms of an arbitrary number
field $K$. This is the first such result for a number field of degree greater than two. Assuming the
Riemann Hypothesis for all Hecke $L$-functions we also show that $\gamma \in (1,2)$ is admissible.
Fourthly, we improve on a recent result of Heath-Brown about gaps between $x^{\varepsilon}$-smooth
numbers. More generally, we obtain results about gaps between multiplicative sequences. Finally
our result is useful in other contexts aswell, for instance in our forthcoming work on Fourier uniformity
(joint with Terence Tao, Joni Terav\"ainen and Tamar Ziegler).
