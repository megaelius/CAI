Despite the success of demand response programs in retail electricity markets in reducing average
consumption, the literature shows failure to reduce the variance of consumers' responses. This
paper aims at designing demand response contracts which allow to act on both the average consumption
and its variance. The interaction between the producer and the consumer is modelled as a Principal-Agent
problem, thus accounting for the moral hazard underlying demand response programs. The producer,
facing the limited flexibility of production, pays an appropriate incentive compensation in order
to encourages the consumer to reduce his average consumption and to enhance his responsiveness.
We provide closed-form solution for the optimal contract in the case of linear energy valuation.
Without responsiveness incentive, this solution decomposes into a fixed premium for enrolment
and a proportional price for the energy consumed, in agreement with previously observed demand
response contracts. The responsiveness incentive induces a new component in the contract with
payment rate on the consumption quadratic variation. Finally, under the optimal contract with
optimal consumer behaviour, the resulting consumption volatility may decrease as required, but
it may also increase depending on the risk aversion parameters of both actors. This agrees with standard
risk sharing effects. The calibration of our model to publicly available data of a large scale demand
response experiment predicts a significant increase of responsiveness under our optimal contract,
a significant increase of the producer satisfaction, and a significant decrease of the consumption
volatility. The stability of our explicit optimal contract is justified by appropriate sensitivity
analysis.
