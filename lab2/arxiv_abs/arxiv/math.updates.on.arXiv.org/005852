The fundamental decomposition of a chemical reaction network (CRN) is induced by partitioning
the reaction set into ''fundamental classes''. It was the basis of the Higher Deficiency Algorithm
for mass action systems of Ji and Feinberg, and the Multistationarity Algorithm for power-law kinetic
systems of Hernandez et al. In this paper, we provide important properties of the independence (i.e.,
the network's stoichiometric subspace is the direct sum of the subnetworks' stoichiometric subspaces)
and the incidence-independence (i.e., the image of the network's incidence map is the direct sum
of the incidence maps' images of the subnetworks) of these decompositions. Feinberg established
the essential relationship between independent decompositions and the set of positive equilibria
of a network, which we call the Feinberg Decomposition Theorem (FDT). In addition, Farinas et al.
recently documented its version for incidence-independence. Fundamental decomposition divides
the network into subnetworks of deficiency either 0 or 1. Hence, available results for lower deficiency
networks, such as the Deficiency Zero Theorem (DZT), can be used. These justify the study of independent
fundamental decompositions. A MATLAB program which (i) computes the subnetworks of a CRN under
the fundamental decomposition and (ii) determines whether the decomposition is independent and
incidence-independent is also created. Finally, we consider the CRN of the generalization of a
subnetwork of Schmitz's carbon cycle model by Hernandez et al. endowed with mass action kinetics,
and we solve the problem of its multistationarity using (1) the program, (2) the DZT, and (3) the FDT.
