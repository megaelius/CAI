This work presents some results about Wick polynomials of a vector field renormalization in locally
covariant algebraic quantum field theory in curved spacetime. General vector fields are pictured
as sections of natural vector bundles over globally hyperbolic spacetimes and quantized through
the known functorial machinery in terms of local $^*$-algebras. These quantized fields may be defined
on spacetimes with given classical background fields, also sections of natural vector bundles,
in addition to the Lorentzian metric. The mass and the coupling constants are in particular viewed
as background fields. Wick powers of the quantized vector field are axiomatically defined imposing
in particular local covariance, scaling properties and smooth dependence on smooth perturbation
of the background fields. A general classification theorem is established for finite renormalization
terms (or counterterms) arising when comparing different solutions satisfying the defining axioms
of Wick powers. The result is specialized to the case of general tensor fields. In particular, the
case of a vector Klein-Gordon field and the case of a scalar field renormalized together with its
derivatives are discussed as examples. In each case, a more precise statement about the structure
of the counterterms is proved. The finite renormalization terms turn out to be finite-order polynomials
tensorially and locally constructed with the backgrounds fields and their covariant derivatives
whose coefficients are locally smooth functions of polynomial scalar invariants constructed
from the so-called marginal subset of the background fields. The notion of local smooth dependence
on polynomial scalar invariants is made precise in the text.
