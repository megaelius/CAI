Secure message dissemination is an important issue in vehicular networks, especially considering
the vulnerability of vehicle to vehicle message dissemination to malicious attacks. Traditional
security mechanisms, largely based on message encryption and key management, can only guarantee
secure message exchanges between known source and destination pairs. In vehicular networks however,
every vehicle may learn its surrounding environment and contributes as a source, while in the meantime
act as a destination or a relay of information from other vehicles, message exchanges often occur
between "stranger" vehicles. For secure message dissemination in vehicular networks against
insider attackers, who may tamper the content of the disseminated messages, ensuring the consistency
and integrity of the transmitted messages becomes a major concern that traditional message encryption
and key management based approaches fall short to provide. In this paper, by incorporating the underlying
network topology information, we propose an optimal decision algorithm that is able to maximize
the chance of making a correct decision on the message content, assuming the prior knowledge of the
percentage of malicious vehicles in the network. Furthermore, a novel heuristic decision algorithm
is proposed that can make decisions without the aforementioned knowledge of the percentage of malicious
vehicles. Simulations are conducted to compare the security performance achieved by our proposed
decision algorithms with that achieved by existing ones that do not consider or only partially consider
the topological information, to verify the effectiveness of the algorithms. Our results show that
by incorporating the network topology information, the security performance can be much improved.
This work shed light on the optimum algorithm design for secure message dissemination.
