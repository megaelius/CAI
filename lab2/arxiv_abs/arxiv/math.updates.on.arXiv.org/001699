This short paper aims to investigate some of the historical developments of one classic, well-cited
and highly esteemed scientific journal in the domain of quantitative operations research - namely
the INFORMS journal Operations Research - over a period of 25 years between 1981 and 2006. As such
this paper, and the journal in question, represents one representative attempt to analyze - for
the purpose of possible future generalization - how research production has evolved, and evolves,
over time. Among the general developments that we think we can trace are that (a) the historical overviews
(i.e., literature surveys) in the articles, as well as the list of references, somewhat counter-intuitively
shrink over time, while (b) the motivating and modelling parts grow. We also attempt to characterize
- in some detail - the appearance and character, over time, of the most cited, as well as the least cited,
papers over the years studied. In particular, we find that many of the least cited papers are quite
imbalanced. For example, some of them include one main section only, and the least cited papers also
have shorter reference lists. We also analyse the articles' utilization of important buzz words
representing the constitutive parts of an OR journal paper, based on Subben's checklist (Larsson
and Patriksson, 2014, 2016). Based on a word count of these buzz words we conclude through a citation
study, utilizing a collection of particularly highly or little cited papers, that there is a quite
strong positive correlation between a journal paper being highly cited and its degree of utilization
of this checklist.
