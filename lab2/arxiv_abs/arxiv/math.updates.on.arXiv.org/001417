In this paper we develop new methods for estimating causal effects in settings with panel data, where
a subset of units are exposed to a treatment during a subset of periods, and the goal is estimating
counterfactual (untreated) outcomes for the treated unit/period combinations. We develop a class
of estimators that uses the observed elements of the matrix of control outcomes corresponding to
untreated unit/periods to predict the "missing" elements of the matrix, corresponding to treated
units/periods. The approach estimates a matrix that well-approximates the original (incomplete)
matrix, but has lower complexity according to a matrix norm, where we consider the family of Schatten
norms based on the singular values of the matrix. The proposed methods have attractive computational
properties. From a technical perspective, we generalize results from the matrix completion literature
by allowing the patterns of missing data to have a time series dependency structure. We also present
new insights concerning the connections between the interactive fixed effects models and the literatures
on program evaluation under unconfoundedness as well as on synthetic control methods. If there
are few time periods and many units, our method approximates a regression approach where counterfactual
outcomes are estimated through a regression of current outcomes on lagged outcomes for the same
unit. In contrast, if there are few units and many periods, our proposed method approximates a synthetic
control estimator where counterfactual outcomes are estimated through a regression of the lagged
outcomes for the treated unit on lagged outcomes for the control units. The advantage of our proposed
method is that it moves seamlessly between these two different approaches, utilizing both cross-sectional
and within-unit patterns in the data.
