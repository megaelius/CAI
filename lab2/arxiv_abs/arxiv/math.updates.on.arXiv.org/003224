The groupcast index coding problem is the most general version of the classical index coding problem,
where any receiver can demand messages that are also demanded by other receivers. Any groupcast
index coding problem is described by its \emph{fitting matrix} which contains unknown entries
along with $1$'s and $0$'s. The problem of finding an optimal scalar linear code is equivalent to
completing this matrix with known entries such that the rank of the resulting matrix is minimized.
Any row basis of such a completion gives an optimal \emph{scalar linear} code. An index coding problem
is said to be a joint extension of a finite number of index coding problems, if the fitting matrices
of these problems are disjoint submatrices of the fitting matrix of the jointly extended problem.
In this paper, a class of joint extensions of any finite number of groupcast index coding problems
is identified, where the relation between the fitting matrices of the sub-problems present in the
fitting matrix of the jointly extended problem is defined by a base problem. A lower bound on the \emph{minrank}
(optimal scalar linear codelength) of the jointly extended problem is given in terms of those of
the sub-problems. This lower bound also has a dependence on the base problem and is operationally
useful in finding lower bounds of the jointly extended problems when the minranks of all the sub-problems
are known. Then, we provide a code construction (not necessarily optimal) for a special class of
the jointly extended problem based on any codes of the base problem and all the sub-problems. A set
of necessary conditions for the optimality of the constructed codes is given based on these bounds.
