Duality plays an important role in population genetics. It can relate results from forwards-in-time
models of allele frequency evolution with those of backwards-in-time genealogical models; a well
known example is the duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion for genetic drift and its genealogical
counterpart, the coalescent. There have been a number of articles extending this relationship
to include other evolutionary processes such as mutation and selection, but little has been explored
for models also incorporating crossover recombination. Here, we derive from first principles
a new genealogical process which is dual to a Wright-Fisher diffusion model of drift, mutation,
and recombination. Our approach is based on expressing a putative duality relationship between
two models via their infinitesimal generators, and then seeking an appropriate test function to
ensure the validity of the duality equation. This approach is quite general, and we use it to find
dualities for several important variants, including both a discrete L-locus model of a gene and
a continuous model in which mutation and recombination events are scattered along the gene according
to continuous distributions. As an application of our results, we derive a series expansion for
the transition function of the diffusion. Finally, we study in further detail the case in which mutation
is absent. Then the dual process describes the dispersal of ancestral genetic material across the
ancestors of a sample. The stationary distribution of this process is of particular interest; we
show how duality relates this distribution to haplotype fixation probabilities. We develop an
efficient method for computing such probabilities in multilocus models.
