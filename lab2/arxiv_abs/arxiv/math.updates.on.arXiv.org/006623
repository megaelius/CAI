We consider a non-cooperative multi-stage game with discrete-time dynamics. The salient aspect
of our model is that it includes `environment' variables which influence the cost as well as the state
dynamics of each player. The `environment variables' are identical for all players and are determined
by the decisions of all players. We provide a stochastic and dynamic generalization of what is known
as the price-taking behavior in the economics literature in which each player chooses its decisions
optimally under the (incorrect) belief that the environment variables are generated by an independent
and exogenous stochastic process. In our setup, players observe only the past realizations of the
environment variables in addition to their own state realizations and their own past decisions.
At an equilibrium, referred to as a \textit{subjective equilibrium}, if players are given the full
distribution of the stochastic environment process as if it is an exogenous process, they would
have no incentive to unilaterally deviate from their equilibrium strategies. We establish the
existence of subjective equilibria in mixed strategies for general compact metric space models.
We study various structural properties of such equilibria in two different cases where the state,
control, disturbance, and environment variables belong to (i) finite sets or (ii) finite dimensional
Euclidean spaces. In either case, the time-horizon can be finite as well as infinite. We establish
the near person-by-person optimality of a subjective equilibrium (which constitutes an approximate
Nash equilibrium) when there are large number of players and the environment variables are generated
either by the empirical distributions of the decisions in the first case or by the average decisions
in the second case. This result on near person-by-person optimality is also extended to pure strategies
under additional assumptions.
