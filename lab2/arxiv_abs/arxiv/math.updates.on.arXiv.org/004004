Reservoir engineers use large-scale numerical models to predict the production performance in
oil and gas fields. However, these models are constructed based on scarce and often inaccurate data,
making their predictions highly uncertain. On the other hand, measurements of pressure and flow
rates are constantly collected during the operation of the field. The assimilation of these data
into the reservoir models (history matching) helps to mitigate uncertainty and improve their predictive
capacity. History matching is a nonlinear inverse problem, which is typically handled using optimization
and Monte Carlo methods. In practice, however, generating a set of properly history-matched models
that preserve the geological realism is very challenging, especially in cases with complicated
prior description, such as models with fractures and complex facies distributions. Recently,
a new data-space inversion (DSI) approach was introduced in the literature as an alternative to
the model-space inversion used in history matching. The essential idea is to update directly the
predictions from a prior ensemble of models to account for the observed production history without
updating the corresponding models. The present paper introduces a DSI implementation based on
the use of an iterative ensemble smoother and demonstrates with examples that the new implementation
is computationally faster and more robust than the earlier method based on principal component
analysis. The new DSI is also applied to estimate the production forecast in a real field with long
production history and a large number of wells. For this field problem, the new DSI obtained forecasts
comparable with a more traditional ensemble-based history matching.
