A common format for sports contests involves pairwise matches between two teams, with the #1 player
of team A matched against the #1 player of team B, the #2 player of team A against the #2 player of team
B, and so on. This paper addresses the following question: What if team A wants to game the system?
Can it gain an advantage by putting its players in a different order? The first example of this problem
in history (to the author's knowledge) was a match of three horse races between the King of Qi and general
Tian Ji, in China, in the fourth century B.C. Tian Ji's protege, Sun Bin, advised the general to throw
the first race, running his #3 horse against the king's #1, and then to race his #1 horse against the
king's #2 and his #2 horse against the king's #3. In this way, Tian Ji won the match, 2-1, and Sun Bin
ensured his reputation as a great strategist. The paper introduces a card-game version of this puzzle,
called One Round War, and derives the optimal strategy in case each side has N cards (the analogue
of N horses). The problem is recast as a linear assignment problem. The optimal solution involves
sacrificing the weakest k cards/horses (for some k = k(N)) against the opponent's strongest k in
reverse order (weakest vs. strongest), and then playing the remaining N-k cards/horses against
the opponent's remaining cards in forward order. An exact formula is derived for k(N), and asymptotically
we show that k(N) ~ sqrt (N ln N/2). Note: This paper proves that the strategy described above is optimal
for sufficiently large N (e.g., for N greater than 10^7). It has also been verified by computer to
be optimal for N less than 60. We conjecture that it is also true for N between 60 and 10^7. The upper
bound 10^7 can be greatly improved, but closing the gap completely will probably require computer
calculations that are beyond our resources.
