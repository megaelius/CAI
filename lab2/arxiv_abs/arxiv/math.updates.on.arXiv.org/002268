This paper presents the SCvx algorithm, a successive convexification algorithm designed to solve
non-convex optimal control problems with global convergence and superlinear convergence-rate
guarantees. The proposed algorithm handles nonlinear dynamics and non-convex state and control
constraints by linearizing them about the solution of the previous iterate, and solving the resulting
convex subproblem to obtain a solution for the current iterate. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates
several safe-guarding techniques into each convex subproblem, employing virtual controls and
virtual buffer zones to avoid artificial infeasibility, and a trust region to avoid artificial
unboundedness. The procedure is repeated in succession, thus turning a difficult non-convex optimal
control problem into a sequence of numerically tractable convex subproblems. Using fast and reliable
Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers, the convex subproblems can be computed quickly, making the
SCvx algorithm well suited for real-time applications. Analysis is presented to show that the algorithm
converges both globally and superlinearly, guaranteeing the local optimality of the original
problem. The superlinear convergence is obtained by exploiting the structure of optimal control
problems, showcasing the superior convergence rate that can be obtained by leveraging specific
problem properties when compared to generic nonlinear programming methods. Numerical simulations
are performed for an illustrative non-convex quad-rotor motion planning example problem, and
corresponding results obtained using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver are provided
for comparison. Our results show that the convergence rate of the SCvx algorithm is indeed superlinear,
and surpasses that of the SQP-based method by converging in less than half the number of iterations.
