In this article we study two classical potential-theoretic problems in convex geometry corresponding
to a nonlinear capacity, $\mbox{Cap}_{\mathcal{A}}$, where $\mathcal{A}$-capacity is associated
with a nonlinear elliptic PDE whose structure is modeled on the $p$-Laplace equation and whose solutions
in an open set are called $ \mathcal{A}$-harmonic. In the first part of this article, we prove the
Brunn-Minkowski inequality for this capacity: \[ \left[\mbox{Cap}_\mathcal{A}(\lambda E_1
+(1-\lambda)E_2)\right]^{\frac{1}{(n-p)}}\geq\lambda\left[\mbox{Cap}_\mathcal{A}(E_1)\right]^{\frac{1}{(n-p)}}+(1-\lambda)\left[\mbox{Cap}_\mathcal{A}(E_2
)\right]^{\frac{1}{(n-p)}} \] when $1<p<n$, $0<\lambda <1$, and $E_1, E_2$ are convex compact
sets with positive $\mathcal{A}$-capacity. Moreover, if equality holds in the above inequality
for some $E_1$ and $E_2, $ then under certain regularity and structural assumptions on $\mathcal{A}$,
we show that these two sets are homothetic. In the second part of this article we study a Minkowski
problem for a certain measure associated with a compact convex set $E$ with nonempty interior and
its $\mathcal{A}$-harmonic capacitary function in the complement of $E$. If $\mu_E$ denotes this
measure, then the Minkowski problem we consider in this setting is that; for a given finite Borel
measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, find necessary and sufficient conditions for which there
exists $E$ as above with $\mu_E =\mu$. We show that necessary and sufficient conditions for existence
under this setting are exactly the same conditions as in the classical Minkowski problem for volume
as well as in the work of Jerison for electrostatic capacity. Using the Brunn-Minkowski inequality
result from the first part, we also show that this problem has a unique solution up to translation
when $p\neq n- 1$ and translation and dilation when $p = n-1$.
