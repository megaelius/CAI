Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear waveform matching procedure, which suffers from cycle
skipping when the initial model is not kinematically-accurate enough. To mitigate cycle skipping,
wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) extends the inversion search space by computing wavefields
with a relaxation of the wave equation in order to fit the data from the first iteration. Then, the
subsurface parameters are updated by minimizing the source residuals the relaxation generated.
Capitalizing on the wave-equation bilinearity, performing wavefield reconstruction and parameter
estimation in alternating mode decomposes WRI into two linear subproblems, which can solved efficiently
with the alternating-direction method of multiplier (ADMM), leading to the so-called IR-WRI.
Moreover, ADMM provides a suitable framework to implement bound constraints and different types
of regularizations and their mixture in IR-WRI. Here, IR-WRI is extended to multiparameter reconstruction
for VTI acoustic media. To achieve this goal, we first propose different forms of bilinear VTI acoustic
wave equation. We develop more specifically IR-WRI for the one that relies on a parametrisation
involving vertical wavespeed and Thomsen's parameters delta and epsilon. With a toy numerical
example, we first show that the radiation patterns of the virtual sources generate similar wavenumber
filtering and parameter cross-talks in classical FWI and IR-WRI. Bound constraints and TV regularization
in IR-WRI fully remove these undesired effects for an idealized piecewise constant target. We show
with a more realistic long-offset case study representative of the North Sea that anisotropic IR-WRI
successfully reconstruct the vertical wavespeed starting from a laterally homogeneous model
and update the long-wavelengths of the starting epsilon model, while a smooth delta model is used
as a passive background model.
