In this article, a new unified duality theory is developed for Petrov-Galerkin finite element methods.
This novel theory is then used to motivate goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement strategies for
use with discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods. The focus of this article is mainly on broken
ultraweak variational formulations of stationary boundary value problems, however, many of the
ideas presented within are general enough that they be extended to any such well-posed variational
formulation. The proposed goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement procedures require the construction
of refinement indicators for both a primal problem and a dual problem. In the DPG context, the primal
problem is simply the system of linear equations coming from a standard DPG method and the dual problem
is a similar system of equations, coming from a new method which is dual to DPG. This new method has
the same coefficient matrix as the associated DPG method but has a different load. We refer to this
new finite element method as a DPG* method. A thorough analysis of DPG* methods, as stand-alone finite
element methods, is not given here but will be provided in subsequent articles. For DPG methods,
the current theory of a posteriori error estimation is reviewed and the reliability estimate in
[13, Theorem 2.1] is improved on. For DPG* methods, three different classes of refinement indicators
are derived and several contributions are made towards rigorous a posteriori error estimation.
At the closure of the article, results of numerical experiments with Poisson's boundary value problem
in a three-dimensional domain are provided. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of the
goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement strategies for quantities of interest with either interior
or boundary terms.
