We show that the mesh mutations are the minimal relations among the $\mathbf{g}$-vectors with respect
to any initial seed in any finite type cluster algebra. We then use this algebraic result to derive
geometric properties of the $\mathbf{g}$-vector fan: we show that the space of all its polytopal
realizations is a simplicial cone, and we then observe that this property implies that all its realizations
can be described as the intersection of a high dimensional positive orthant with well-chosen affine
spaces. This sheds a new light on and extends earlier results of N. Arkani-Hamed, Y. Bai, S. He, and
G. Yan in type $A$ and of V. Bazier-Matte, G. Douville, K. Mousavand, H. Thomas and E. Yildirim for
acyclic initial seeds. Moreover, we use a similar approach to study the space of polytopal realizations
of the $\mathbf{g}$-vector fans of other generalizations of the associahedron. For non-kissing
complexes (a.k.a. support $\tau$-tilting complexes) of gentle algebras, we show that the space
of realizations of the non-kissing fan is simplicial when the gentle bound quiver is brick and $2$-acyclic,
and we describe in this case its facet-defining inequalities in terms of mesh mutations. For graphical
nested complexes, we show that the space of realizations of the nested fan is simplicial only in the
case of the associahedron, and we describe its facet-defining inequalities in general. Along the
way, we prove algebraic results on $2$-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories, and on extriangulated
categories that are of independent interest. In particular, we prove, in those two setups, an analogue
of a result of M. Auslander on minimal relations for Grothendieck groups of module categories.
