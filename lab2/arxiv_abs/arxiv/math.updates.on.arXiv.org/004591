In this paper, we consider the multi-server setting of Private Information Retrieval with Private
Coded Side Information (PIR-PCSI) problem. In this problem, there is a database of $K$ messages
whose copies are replicated across $N$ servers, and there is a user who knows a random linear combination
of a random subset of $M$ messages in the database as side information. The user wishes to download
one message from the servers, while protecting the identities of both the demand message and the
messages forming the side information. We assume that the servers know the number of messages forming
the user's side information in advance, whereas the indices of these messages and their coefficients
in the side information are not known to any of the servers a priori. Our goal is to characterize (or
derive a lower bound on) the capacity, i.e., the maximum achievable download rate, for the following
two settings. In the first setting, the set of messages forming the linear combination available
to the user as side information, does not include the user's demanded message. For this setting,
we show that the capacity is equal to $\left(1+{1}/{N}+\dots+{1}/{N^{K-M-1}}\right)^{-1}$.
In the second setting, the demand message contributes to the linear combination available to the
user as side information, i.e., the demand message is one of the messages that form the user's side
information. For this setting, we show that the capacity is lower-bounded by $\left(1+{1}/{N}+\dots+{1}/{N^{K-M}}\right)^{-1}$.
The proposed achievability schemes and proof techniques leverage ideas from both our recent methods
proposed for the single-server PIR-PCSI problem as well as the techniques proposed by Sun and Jafar
for multi-server private computation problem.
