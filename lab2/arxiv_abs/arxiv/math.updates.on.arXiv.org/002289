We consider the problem of sampling from the Potts model on random regular graphs. It is conjectured
that sampling is possible when the temperature of the model is in the uniqueness regime of the regular
tree, but positive algorithmic results have been for the most part elusive. In this paper, for all
integers $q\geq 3$ and $\Delta\geq 3$, we develop algorithms that produce samples within error
$o(1)$ from the $q$-state Potts model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs, whenever the temperature
is in uniqueness, for both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. The algorithm for the
antiferromagnetic Potts model is based on iteratively adding the edges of the graph and resampling
a bichromatic class that contains the endpoints of the newly added edge. Key to the algorithm is how
to perform the resampling step efficiently since bichromatic classes may induce linear-sized
components. To this end, we exploit the tree uniqueness to show that the average growth of bichromatic
components is typically small, which allows us to use correlation decay algorithms for the resampling
step. While the precise uniqueness threshold on the tree is not known for general values of $q$ and
$\Delta$ in the antiferromagnetic case, our algorithm works throughout uniqueness regardless
of its value. In the case of the ferromagnetic Potts model, we simplify the algorithm significantly
by utilising the random-cluster representation of the model. In particular, we show that a percolation-type
algorithm succeeds in sampling from the random-cluster model with parameters $p,q$ on random $\Delta$-regular
graphs for all values of $q\geq 1$ and $p<p_c(q,\Delta)$, where $p_c(q,\Delta)$ corresponds to
a uniqueness threshold for the model on the $\Delta$-regular tree. When restricted to integer values
of $q$, this yields a simplified algorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts model on random $\Delta$-regular
graphs.
