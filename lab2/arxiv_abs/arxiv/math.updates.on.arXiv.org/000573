We will study algebraic hyper-surfaces on the real unit sphere $\mathcal S^{n-1}$ given by an homogeneous
polynomial of degree d in n variables with the view point, rarely exploited, of Euclidian geometry
using Bombieri's scalar product and norm. This view point is mostly present in work about the topology
of random hyper-surfaces \cite{ShubSmale93, GayetWelschinger14}. Our first result (lemma \ref{distgen}
page \pageref{distgen}) is a formula for the distance \dist(P,\Delta)$ of a polynomial to the {\em
real discriminant} $\Delta$, i.e. the set of polynomials with a real singularity on the sphere.
This formula is given for any distance coming from a scalar product on the vector space of polynomials.
Then, we concentrate on Bombieri scalar product and its remarkable properties. For instance we
establish a combinatoric formula for the scalar product of two products of linear-forms (lemma
\ref{scalarlinear} page \pageref{scalarlinear}) which allows to give a (new ?) proof of the invariance
of Bombieri's norm by composition with the orthogonal group. These properties yield a simple formula
for the distance in theorem \ref{bombineqdist} page \pageref{bombineqdist} from which we deduce
the following inequality: $\dist(P, \Delta) \leq \min_{x \hbox{ critical point of } P \hbox{ on
} \mathcal S^{n-1}} |P(x)|$ The definition \ref{maindef} page \pageref{maindef} classifies
in two categories the ways to make a polynomial singular to realise the distance to the discriminant.
Then, we show, in theorem \ref{extremal} page \pageref{extremal}, that one of the category is forbidden
in the case of an {\em extremal} hyper-surfaces (i.e. with maximal Betti numbers). This implies
as a corollary \ref{bombeqdistbis} (page \pageref{bombeqdistbis}) that the above inequality
becomes an equality is that case. The main result in this paper concerns extremal hyper-surfaces
$P=0$ that maximise the distance to the discriminant (with $\|P\| = 1$). They are very remarkable
objects which enjoy properties similar to those of quadratic forms: they are linear combination
of power of linear forms $x \mapsto \langle x | u_i \rangle^d$ where the vector $u_i$ are the critical
points of $P$ on $\mathcal S^{n-1}$ corresponding to the least positive critical value of $|P|$.
This is corollary \ref{comblinbis} page \pageref{comblinbis} of a similar theorem \ref{comblin}
page \pageref{comblin} for all algebraic hyper-surfaces. We also obtain metric information about
algebraic hyper-surfaces. First, in the case of extremal hyper-surface, we give an upper bound
(theorem \ref{bandwidth} page \pageref{bandwidth}) on the length of an integral curve of the gradient
of $P$ in the band where $|P|$ is less that the least positive critical value of $|P|$. Then, a general
lower bound on the size and distance between the connected components (corollary \ref{sphereinside}
and theorem \ref{distancebetween}). The last section will present experimental results among
which are five extremal sextic curves far from the discriminant. These are obtained by very long
running numerical optimisation (many months).
