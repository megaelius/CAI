A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is \emph{isolating} if every component of $G-V(C)$ is a single vertex. We
show that isolating cycles in polyhedral graphs can be extended to larger ones: every isolating
cycle $C$ of length $8 \leq |E(C)| < \frac{2}{3}(|V(G)|+3)$ implies an isolating cycle $C'$ of larger
length that contains $V(C)$. By ``hopping'' iteratively to such larger cycles, we obtain a powerful
and very general inductive motor for proving and computing long cycles (we will give an algorithm
with running time $O(n^2)$). This provides a method to prove lower bounds on Tutte cycles, as $C'$
will be a Tutte cycle of $G$ if $C$ is. We also prove that $E(C') \leq E(C)+3$ if $G$ does not contain
faces of size five, which gives a new tool for proving results about cycle spectra and evidence that
these face sizes obstruct long cycles. As a sample application, we test our motor on a conjecture
on essentially 4-connected graphs. A planar graph is \emph{essentially $4$-connected} if it is
3-connected and every of its 3-separators is the neighborhood of a single vertex. Essentially $4$-connected
graphs have been thoroughly investigated throughout literature as the subject of Hamiltonicity
studies. Jackson and Wormald proved that every essentially 4-connected planar graph $G$ on $n$
vertices contains a cycle of length at least $\frac{2}{5}(n+2)$, and this result has recently been
improved multiple times, culminating in the lower bound $\frac{5}{8}(n+2)$. However, the best
known upper bound is given by an infinite family of such graphs in which every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
has no cycle longer than $\frac{2}{3}(n+4)$; this upper bound is still unmatched. Using isolating
cycles, we improve the lower bound to match the upper (up to a summand $+1$). This settles the long-standing
open problem of determining the circumference of essentially 4-connected planar graphs.
