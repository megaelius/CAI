Let $P_s:= \mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_s]$ be the graded polynomial algebra over the prime field
of two elements, $\mathbb F_2$, in $s$ variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_s$, each of degree 1. We are
interested in the Peterson "hit" problem of finding a minimal set of generators for the polynomial
algebra $P_s$ as an unstable left module over the mod 2 Steenrod algebra, $\mathscr{A}$. Equivalently,
we want to find a basis for the $\mathbb F_2$-graded vector space $$QP_s := \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr
A} P_s \cong P_s/\mathscr A^+P_s,$$ where $\mathscr A^+$ is the augmentation ideal of $\mathscr
A$ and and $\mathbb F_2$ is viewed as a right $\mathscr A$-module concentrated in grading $0.$ The
hit problem, which is a useful tool in studying the image of the Singer algebraic transfer, has a deep
connection with classical problems in the homotopy theory. For $s\geq 5,$ it is an open problem.
As it is known, the hit problem is reduced to the case of the degree $d$ of the form \begin{equation}\label{ct}\tag{1}
d = r(2^t-1) + 2^tm \end{equation} with $r,\ t, \ m$ positive integers such that $\mu(m) < r\leq s$.
Here, $\mu(m)$ is the smallest number $k$ for which it is possible to write $m =\sum_{1\leq i \leq
k}(2^{n_i}-1),$ where $n_i > 0.$ In this paper, we study the hit problem in the $5$-variable case.
More explicitly, we investigate the space $QP_s$ for $s = 5$ and in degree $d$ of the form \eqref{ct}
with $r = 3, m = 1$ and $t$ an arbitrary positive integer. These results are used to study the Singer
algebraic transfer which is a homomorphism form the homology of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra, $\mbox{Tor}^{\mathscr{A}}_{s,
s+*}(\mathbb{F}_2, \mathbb{F}_2)$ to the subspace $(QP_s)_*^{GL_s}$ of $QP_s$ consisting of
all the $GL_s$-invariant classes. Here, $GL_s:=GL(s, \mathbb F_2)$ is the general linear group
of rank $s$ over $\mathbb{F}_2.$
