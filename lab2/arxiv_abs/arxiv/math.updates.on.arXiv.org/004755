Let $\left( a\left( x \right),xa\left( x \right) \right)$ is the Riordan matrix from the Bell subgroup.
We denote ${{\left( a\left( x \right),xa\left( x \right) \right)}^{\varphi }}=\left( {{a}^{\left(
\varphi \right)}}\left( x \right),x{{a}^{\left( \varphi \right)}}\left( x \right) \right)$,
where power of the matrix is defined in the standard way. Polynomials ${{c}_{n}}\left( x \right)$
such that ${{a}^{\left( \varphi \right)}}\left( x \right)=\sum\nolimits_{n=0}^{\infty }{{{c}_{n}}}\left(
\varphi \right){{x}^{n}}$ will be called composition polynomials. We consider composition polynomials
of the RNA matrix. Construction associated with these polynomials allows the following generalization.
If the matrix $\left( a\left( x \right),xa\left( x \right) \right)$ is a pseudo-involution, then
there exists numerical sequence ($B$-sequence) with the generating function $B\left( x \right)$
such that $a\left( x \right)=1+xa\left( x \right)B\left( {{x}^{2}}a\left( x \right) \right)$.
Matrix, whose $B$-sequence has the generating function $\varphi B\left( x \right)$, will be denoted
by $\left( {{a}^{\left[ \varphi \right]}}\left( x \right),x{{a}^{\left[ \varphi \right]}}\left(
x \right) \right)$. Polynomials ${{u}_{n}}\left( x \right)$ such that ${{a}^{\left[ \varphi
\right]}}\left( x \right)=\sum\nolimits_{n=0}^{\infty }{{{u}_{n}}}\left( \varphi \right){{x}^{n}}$
will be called $B$-composition polynomials. Coefficients of these polynomials are expressed
in terms of the $B$-sequence. We show that the matrices whose rows correspond to the $B$-composition
polynomials are connected with the exponential Riordan matrices in a certain way.
