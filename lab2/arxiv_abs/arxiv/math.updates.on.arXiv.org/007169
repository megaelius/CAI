In this article, we obtain two sets of results. The first set of complete results are exclusively
for the case of the bi-disc while the second set of results describe in part, which of these carry over
to the general case of the poly-disc: * A classification of irreducible hermitian holomorphic vector
bundles over $\mathbb{D}^2$, homogeneous with respect to $\mbox{M\"ob}\times \mbox{M\"ob}$,
is obtained assuming that the associated representations are \textit{multiplicity-free}. Among
these the ones that give rise to an operator in the Cowen-Douglas class of $\mathbb{D}^2$ of rank
$1,2$ or $3$ is determined. * Any hermitian holomorphic vector bundle of rank $2$ over $\mathbb{D}^n$,
homogeneous with respect to the $n$-fold product of the group $\mbox{M\"ob}$ is shown to be a tensor
product of $n-1$ hermitian holomorphic line bundles, each of which is homogeneous with respect
to $\mbox{M\"ob}$ and a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle of rank $2$, homogeneous with respect
to $\mbox{M\"ob}$. * The classification of irreducible homogeneous hermitian holomorphic vector
buldles over $\mathbb{D}^2$ of rank $3$ (as well as the corresponding Cowen-Douglas class of operators)
is extended to the case of $\mathbb{D}^n$, $n>2$. * It is shown that there is no irreducible $n$ - tuple
of operators in the Cowen-Douglas class $\mathrm B_2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ that is homogeneous with
respect $\mbox{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^n)$, $n >1$. Also, pairs of operators in $\mathrm B_3(\mathbb{D}^2)$
homogeneous with respect to $\mbox{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ are produced, while it is shown that no
$n$ - tuple of operators in $\mathrm B_3(\mathbb{D}^n)$ is homogeneous with respect to $\mbox{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^n)$,
$n > 2$.
