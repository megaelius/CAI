Due to its potential to support high data rates at low latency with reasonable interference isolation,
millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications has emerged as a promising solution for wireless personal-area
networks (WPAN) and an enabler for emerging applications such as high-resolution untethered virtual
reality. At mmWave, signals are prone to blockage by objects in the environment, including human
bodies. Most mmWave systems utilize directional antennas in order to overcome the significant
path loss. In this paper, we consider the effects of blockage and antenna directivity on the performance
of a mmWave WPAN. Similar to related work, we assume that the interferers are in arbitrary locations
and the blockages are drawn from a random point process. However, unlike related work that assumes
independent blocking, we carefully account for the possibility of correlated blocking, which
arises when two interferers are close to each other and therefore an obstruction that blocks the
first interferer may likely block the second interferer. Closed form expressions for the blockage
correlation coefficient and the distribution of the SINR are provided for the case of two dominant
interferers and a fixed number of blockages drawn from a binomial point process. Finally, the effects
of antenna directivity and the spatial randomness of the interferers are taken into account, resulting
in SINR curves that fully account for correlated blocking, which are compared against curves that
neglect correlation. The results provide insight into the validity of the commonly held assumption
of independent blocking and the improved accuracy that can be obtained when the blocking correlation
is taken into account.
