In this set of three companion manuscripts/articles, we unveil our new results on primality testing
and reveal new primality testing algorithms enabled by those results. The results have been classified
(and referred to) as lemmas/corollaries/claims whenever we have complete analytic proof(s);
otherwise the results are introduced as conjectures. In Part/Article 1, we start with the Baseline
Primality Conjecture~(PBPC) which enables deterministic primality detection with a low complexity
= O((log N)^2) ; when an explicit value of a Quadratic Non Residue (QNR) modulo-N is available (which
happens to be the case for an overwhelming majority = 11/12 = 91.67% of all odd integers). We then demonstrate
Primality Lemma PL-1, which reveals close connections between the state-of-the-art Miller-Rabin
method and the renowned Euler-Criterion. This Lemma, together with the Baseline Primality Conjecture
enables a synergistic fusion of Miller-Rabin iterations and our method(s), resulting in hybrid
algorithms that are substantially better than their components. Next, we illustrate how the requirement
of an explicit value of a QNR can be circumvented by using relations of the form: Polynomial(x) mod
N = 0 ; whose solutions implicitly specify Non Residues modulo-N. We then develop a method to derive
low-degree canonical polynomials that together guarantee implicit Non Residues modulo-N ; which
along with the Generalized Primality Conjectures enable algorithms that achieve a worst case deterministic
polynomial complexity = O( (log N)^3 polylog(log N)) ; unconditionally ; for any/all values of N.
In Part/Article 2 , we present substantial experimental data that corroborate all the conjectures.
No counter example has been found. Finally in Part/Article 3, we present analytic proof(s) of the
Baseline Primality Conjecture that we have been able to complete for some special cases.
