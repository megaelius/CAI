We motivate and construct a mathematical theory for the separation of space and time in general relativity.
The formalism only requires a single observer and an optional choice of reference frame at each instant.
As the splitting is done via the observer's past light cone, it is both closer to the experimental
situation and mathematically less restrictive than the splitting via observer vector fields or
spacelike hypersurfaces. Indeed, the theory can in principle be applied to all spacetimes and adapted
to other `metric' theories of gravity. Instructive examples are developed along with the general
theory. In particular, we obtain an alternative description for accelerated frames of reference
in Minkowski spacetime. Further, we use the splitting formalism to motivate a new mathematical
approach to the Newtonian limit of the motion of mass points. This employs a general formula for their
observed motion, distinguishing between `actual' forces (i.e. those detectable via an accelerometer)
and pseudo-forces. Via this formula we show that for inertial frames of reference in Minkowski spacetime
the essential laws of non-gravitational Newtonian mechanics can be derived. Physically relevant,
related, open problems are indicated throughout the text. These include the proof, that the Newtonian
limit gives rise to the central pseudo-forces known from Newtonian mechanics (`constant gravity',
Euler, Coriolis and centrifugal force) for non-inertial frames of reference in Minkowski spacetime,
as well as the derivation of Newton's law of gravitation in the Schwarzschild spacetime under said
limit. This is a slightly corrected version of a master's thesis in mathematical relativity, written
at TU Berlin in 2016/2017. Comments by the reviewers have been taken into account. If there are any
remaining errors, they are solely due to the author.
