A model Hamiltonian for the reaction CH$_4^+ \rightarrow$ CH$_3^+$ + H, parametrized to exhibit
either early or late inner transition states, is employed to investigate the dynamical characteristics
of the roaming mechanism. Tight/loose transition states and conventional/roaming reaction pathways
are identified in terms of time-invariant objects in phase space. These are dividing surfaces associated
with normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs). For systems with two degrees of freedom
NHIMS are unstable periodic orbits which, in conjunction with their stable and unstable manifolds,
unambiguously define the (locally) non-recrossing dividing surfaces assumed in statistical
theories of reaction rates. By constructing periodic orbit continuation/bifurcation diagrams
for two values of the potential function parameter corresponding to late and early transition states,
respectively, and using the total energy as another parameter, we dynamically assign different
regions of phase space to reactants and products as well as to conventional and roaming reaction
pathways. The classical dynamics of the system are investigated by uniformly sampling trajectory
initial conditions on the dividing surfaces. Trajectories are classified into four different
categories: direct reactive and non reactive trajectories,which lead to the formation of molecular
and radical products respectively, and roaming reactive and non reactive orbiting trajectories,
which represent alternative pathways to form molecular and radical products. By analysing gap
time distributions at several energies we demonstrate that the phase space structure of the roaming
region, which is strongly influenced by non-linear resonances between the two degrees of freedom,
results in nonexponential (nonstatistical) decay.
