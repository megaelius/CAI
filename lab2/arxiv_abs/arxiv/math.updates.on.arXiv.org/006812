We study the problem of maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of an approximate common eigenstructure,
i.e. an approximate common eigenvectors set (CES), for an ensemble of covariance matrices given
a collection of their associated i.i.d vector realizations. This problem has a direct application
in multi-user MIMO communications, where the base station (BS) has access to instantaneous user
channel vectors through pilot transmission and attempts to perform joint multi-user Downlink
(DL) precoding. It is widely accepted that an efficient implementation of this task hinges upon
an appropriate design of a set of common "virtual beams", that captures the common eigenstructure
among the user channel covariances. In this paper, we propose a novel method for obtaining this common
eigenstructure by casting it as an ML estimation problem. We prove that in the special case where
the covariances are jointly diagonalizable, the global optimal solution of the proposed ML problem
coincides with the common eigenstructure. Then we propose a projected gradient descent (PGD) method
to solve the ML optimization problem over the manifold of unitary matrices and prove its convergence
to a stationary point. Through exhaustive simulations, we illustrate that in the case of jointly
diagonalizable covariances, our proposed method converges to the exact CES. Also, in the general
case where the covariances are not jointly diagonalizable, it yields a solution that approximately
diagonalizes all covariances. Besides, the empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms
the well-known joint approximate diagonalization of eigenmatrices (JADE) method in the literature.
