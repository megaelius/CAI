We establish precise regularity conditions for $L_p$-boundedness of Fourier multipliers in the
group algebra of $SL_n(\mathbf{R})$. Our main result is inspired by H\"ormander-Mikhlin criterion
from classical harmonic analysis, although it is substantially and necessarily different. Locally,
we get sharp growth rates of Lie derivatives around the singularity and nearly optimal regularity
order. The asymptotics also match Mikhlin formula for a exponentially growing metric with respect
to the word length. Additional decay comes imposed by this growth and Mikhlin condition for high
order terms. Lafforgue/de la Salle's rigidity theorem fits here. The proof includes a new relation
between Fourier and Schur $L_p$-multipliers for nonamenable groups. In $SL_n(\mathbf{R})$,
this holds in terms of Harish-Chandra's almost $L_2$ matrix coefficients. By transference, matters
are reduced to a rather nontrivial $RC_p$-inequality for $SL_n(\mathbf{R})$-twisted forms of
Riesz transforms associated to fractional laplacians. Our second result gives a new and much stronger
rigidity theorem for radial multipliers in $SL_n(\mathbf{R})$. More precisely, additional regularity
and Mikhlin type conditions are proved to be necessary up to an order $\sim |\frac12 - \frac1p| (n-1)$
for large enough $n$ in terms of $p$. Locally, necessary and sufficient growth rates match up to that
order. Asymptotically, extra decay for the symbol and its derivatives imposes more accurate and
additional rigidity in a wider range of $L_p$-spaces. This rigidity increases with the rank, so
we can construct radial generating functions satisfying our H\"ormander-Mikhlin sufficient
conditions in rank $n$ and failing the rigidity conditions for ranks $m >> n$. We also prove automatic
regularity and rigidity estimates for first and higher order derivatives of $\mathrm{K}$-biinvariant
multipliers in the rank 1 groups $SO(n,1)$.
