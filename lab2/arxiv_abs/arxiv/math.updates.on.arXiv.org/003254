We discuss a new pseudometric on the space of all norms on a finite-dimensional vector space (or free
module) $\mathbb{F}^k$, with $\mathbb{F}$ the real, complex, or quaternion numbers. This metric
arises from the Lipschitz-equivalence of all norms on $\mathbb{F}^k$, and seems to be unexplored
in the literature. We initiate the study of the associated quotient metric space, and show that it
is complete, connected, and non-compact. In particular, the new topology is strictly coarser than
that of the Banach-Mazur compactum. For example, for each $k \geqslant 2$ the metric subspace $\{
\| \cdot \|_p : p \in [1,\infty] \}$ maps isometrically and monotonically to $[0, \log k]$ (or $[0,1]$
by scaling the norm), again unlike in the Banach-Mazur compactum. Our analysis goes through embedding
the above quotient space into a normed space, and reveals an implicit functorial construction of
function spaces with diameter norms (as well as a variant of the distortion). In particular, we realize
the above quotient space of norms as a normed space. We next study the parallel setting of the - also
hitherto unexplored - metric space $\mathcal{S}([n])$ of all metrics on a finite set of $n$ elements,
revealing the connection between log-distortion and diameter norms. In particular, we show that
$\mathcal{S}([n])$ is also a normed space. We demonstrate embeddings of equivalence classes of
finite metric spaces (parallel to the Gromov-Hausdorff setting), as well as of $\mathcal{S}([n-1])$,
into $\mathcal{S}([n])$. We conclude by discussing extensions to norms on an arbitrary Banach
space and to discrete metrics on any set, as well as some questions in both settings above.
