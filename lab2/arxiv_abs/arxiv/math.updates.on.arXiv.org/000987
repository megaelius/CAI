The present paper shows that warped Riemannian metrics, a class of Riemannian metrics which play
a prominent role in Riemannian geometry, are also of fundamental importance in information geometry.
Precisely, the paper features a new theorem, which states that the Rao-Fisher information metric
of any location-scale model, defined on a Riemannian manifold, is a warped Riemannian metric, whenever
this model is invariant under the action of some Lie group. This theorem is a valuable tool in finding
the expression of the Rao-Fisher information metric of location-scale models defined on high-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds. Indeed, a warped Riemannian metric is fully determined by only two functions
of a single variable, irrespective of the dimension of the underlying Riemannian manifold. Starting
from this theorem, several original contributions are made. The expression of the Rao-Fisher information
metric of the Riemannian Gaussian model is provided, for the first time in the literature. A generalised
definition of the Mahalanobis distance is introduced, which is applicable to any location-scale
model defined on a Riemannian manifold. The solution of the geodesic equation is obtained, for any
Rao-Fisher information metric defined in terms of warped Riemannian metrics. Finally, using a
mixture of analytical and numerical computations, it is shown that the parameter space of the von
Mises-Fisher model of $n$-dimensional directional data, when equipped with its Rao-Fisher information
metric, becomes a Hadamard manifold, a simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold of negative
sectional curvature, for $n = 2,\ldots,8$. Hopefully, in upcoming work, this will be proved for
any value of $n$.
