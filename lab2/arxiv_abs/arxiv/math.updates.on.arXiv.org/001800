A Hamburger moment sequence (s_n) is characterized by positive definiteness of the infinite Hankel
matrix \mathcal H=\{s_{m+n}\}. In the indeterminate case, where different measures have the same
moments, there exists an infinite symmetric matrix \mathcal A=\{a_{j,k}\} given by the reproducing
kernel K(z,w)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(z)P_n(w)=\sum_{j,k=0}^\infty a_{j,k}z^jw^k, defined
in terms of the orthonormal polynomials P_n(z). We say that the matrix product \mathcal A\mathcal
H is absolutely convergent, if all elements of \mathcal A\mathcal H are defined by absolutely convergent
series. We study the question if the matrix product \mathcal A\mathcal H is absolutely convergent
and yields the identity matrix \mathcal I. We prove that this is always the case, when the moment problem
is symmetric and xP_n(x)=b_nP_{n+1}(x)+b_{n-1}P_{n-1}(x) for a sequence (b_n) such that b_{n-1}/b_n\le
q<1 for n sufficiently large, hence in particular for eventually log-convex sequences (b_n) such
that \sum 1/b_n<\infty. It also holds for certain eventually log-concave sequences (b_n) including
b_n=(n+1)^c, c>3/2. The latter is based on new estimates for the symmetrized version of a cubic birth-and-death
process studied by Valent and co-authors, and in this case \mathcal A\mathcal H is not absolutely
convergent. The general results of the paper are based on a study of two scale invariant sequences
(U_n) and (V_n). Here, U_n=s_{2n}/(b_0b_1\ldots b_{n-1})^2 is defined for any moment problem,
while V_n=b_0b_1\ldots b_{n-1}c_n only makes sense for indeterminate moment problems, because
c_n:=\sqrt{a_{n,n}}. A major result is that (U_n) and (V_n) are bounded for symmetric indeterminate
moment problems for which b_{n-1}/b_n\le q<1 for n sufficiently large.
