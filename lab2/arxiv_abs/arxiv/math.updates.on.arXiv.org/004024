This paper presents a novel nonlinear pose filter evolved directly on the Special Euclidean Group
SE(3) with guaranteed characteristics of transient and steady-state performance. The above-mention
characteristics can be achieved by trapping the position error and the error of the normalized Euclidean
distance of the attitude in a given large set and guiding them to converge systematically to a small
given set. The error vector is proven to approach the origin asymptotically from almost any initial
condition. The proposed filter is able to provide a reliable pose estimate with remarkable convergence
properties such that it can be fitted with measurements obtained from low-cost measurement units.
Simulation results demonstrate high convergence capabilities and robustness considering large
error in initialization and high level of uncertainties in measurements. Keywords: Pose, estimator,
