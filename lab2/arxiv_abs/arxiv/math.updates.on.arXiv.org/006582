For most finite element simulations, boundary-conforming meshes have significant advantages
in terms of accuracy or efficiency. This is particularly true for complex domains. However, with
increased complexity of the domain, generating a boundary-conforming mesh becomes more difficult
and time consuming. One might therefore decide to resort to an approach where individual boundary-conforming
meshes are pieced together in a modular fashion to form a larger domain. This paper presents a stabilized
finite element formulation for fluid and temperature equations on sliding meshes. It couples the
solution fields of multiple subdomains whose boundaries slide along each other on common interfaces.
Thus, the method allows to use highly tuned boundary-conforming meshes for each subdomain that
are only coupled at the overlapping boundary interfaces. In contrast to standard overlapping or
fictitious domain methods the coupling is broken down to few interfaces with reduced geometric
dimension. The formulation consists of the following key ingredients: the coupling of the solution
fields on the overlapping surfaces is imposed weakly using a stabilized version of Nitsche's method.
It ensures mass and energy conservation at the common interfaces. Additionally, we allow to impose
weak Dirichlet boundary conditions at the non-overlapping parts of the interfaces. We present
a detailed numerical study for the resulting stabilized formulation. It shows optimal convergence
behavior for both Newtonian and generalized Newtonian material models. Simulations of flow of
plastic melt inside single-screw as well as twin-screw extruders demonstrate the applicability
of the method to complex and relevant industrial applications.
