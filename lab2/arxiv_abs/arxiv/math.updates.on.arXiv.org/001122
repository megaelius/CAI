Given a domain $I \subset \mathbb{C}$ and an integer $N>0$, a function $f: I \to \mathbb{C}$ is said
to be entrywise positivity preserving on positive semidefinite $N \times N$ matrices $A= (a_{jk})
\in I^{N \times N}$, if the entrywise application $f[A] = (f(a_{jk}))$ of $f$ to $A$ is positive semidefinite
for all such $A$. Such preservers in all dimensions have been classified by Schoenberg as being absolutely
monotonic [Duke Math. J. 1942]; see also Rudin [Duke Math. J. 1959]. In fixed dimension $N$, results
akin to work of Horn and Loewner [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 1969] show that the first $N$ non-zero Maclaurin
coefficients of any polynomial preserver $f$ are positive; and the last $N$ coefficients are also
positive if $I$ is unbounded. However, very little was known about the higher-order coefficients:
the only examples to date for unbounded domains $I$ were absolutely monotonic, hence work in all
dimensions; and for bounded $I$ examples of non-absolutely monotonic preservers were very few
(and recent). In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of the sign patterns of the higher-order
Maclaurin coefficients of positivity preservers in fixed dimension $N$, over bounded and unbounded
domains $I = (0,\rho)$. In particular, this shows that the above Horn-type conditions cannot be
improved upon. As a further special case, this provides the first examples of polynomials which
preserve positivity on positive semidefinite matrices in $I^{N \times N}$ but not in $I^{(N+1)
\times (N+1)}$. Our main tools tools in this regard are the Cauchy-Binet formula and lower and upper
bounds on Schur polynomials. We also obtain analogous results for real exponents, using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber
formula in place of bounds on Schur polynomials.
