Consider the Ising model at low-temperatures and positive external field $\lambda$ on an $N\times
N$ box with Dobrushin boundary conditions that are plus on the north, east, and west boundaries and
minus on the south boundary. If $\lambda = 0$, the interface separating the plus and minus phases
is diffusive, having $O(\sqrt N)$ height fluctuations, and the model is fully wetted. Under an order
one field, the interface fluctuations are $O(1)$ and the interface is only partially wetted, being
pinned to its southern boundary. We study the critical pre-wetting regime of $\lambda_N \downarrow
0$, where the height fluctuations are expected to scale as $\lambda^{ -1/3}$ and the rescaled interface
is predicted to converge to the Ferrari--Spohn diffusion. Velenik (2004) identified the order
of the area under the interface up to logarithmic corrections. Since then, more refined features
of such interfaces have only been identified in simpler models of random walks under area tilts.
In this paper, we resolve several conjectures of Velenik regarding the refined features of the Ising
interface in the critical pre-wetting regime. Our main result is a sharp bound on the one-point height
fluctuation, proving $e^{ - \Theta(x^{3/2})}$ upper tails reminiscent of the Tracy--Widom distribution,
capturing a tradeoff between the locally Brownian oscillations and the global field effect. This
is used to deduce various geometric properties of the interface, including the sharp order of the
area it confines, and the poly-logarithmic pre-factor governing its maximum height fluctuation.
Our arguments combine inputs coming from the random-line representation of the Ising interface,
with more probabilistic and geometric arguments guided by local resampling and coupling methods.
