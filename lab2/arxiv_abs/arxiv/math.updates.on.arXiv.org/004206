We present a Euclidean quantum gravity model in which random graphs dynamically self-assemble
into discrete manifold structures. Concretely, we consider a statistical model driven by a discretisation
of the Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action; contrary to previous approaches based on simplicial
complexes and Regge calculus our discretisation is based on the Ollivier curvature, a coarse analogue
of the manifold Ricci curvature defined for generic graphs. The Ollivier curvature is generally
difficult to evaluate due to its definition in terms of optimal transport theory, but we present
a new exact expression for the Ollivier curvature in a wide class of relevant graphs purely in terms
of the numbers of short cycles at an edge. This result should be of independent intrinsic interest
to network theorists. Action minimising configurations prove to be cubic complexes up to defects;
there are indications that such defects are dynamically suppressed in the macroscopic limit. Closer
examination of a defect free model shows that certain classical configurations have a geometric
interpretation and discretely approximate vacuum solutions to the Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert
action. Working in a configuration space where the geometric configurations are stable vacua of
the theory, we obtain direct numerical evidence for the existence of a continuous phase transition;
this makes the model a UV completion of Euclidean Einstein gravity. Notably, this phase transition
implies an area-law for the entropy of emerging geometric space. Certain vacua of the theory can
be interpreted as baby universes; we find that these configurations appear as stable vacua in a mean
field approximation of our model, but are excluded dynamically whenever the action is exact indicating
the dynamical stability of geometric space. The model is intended as a setting for subsequent studies
of emergent time mechanisms.
