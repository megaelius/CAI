Let $k$ be a totally real number field and let $k_\infty$ be its cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension,
$p \geq 2$. This paper synthesizes and generalizes our articles written in french: "Approche $p$-adique
de la conjecture de Greenberg pour les corps totalement r\'eels", Ann. Math. Blaise Pascal {\bf
24}(2) (2017), 235--291 and "Normes d'id\'eaux dans la tour cyclotomique et conjecture de Greenberg",
Ann. math. du Qu\'ebec {\bf 43} (2019), 249--280. We show that this conjecture (nullity of the Iwasawa
invariants $\lambda$, $\mu$) depends on some images (of ideal norms along the stages $k_n/k$ of
the tower) in the torsion group ${\mathcal T}_k$ of the Galois group of the maximal abelian $p$-ramified
pro-$p$-extension of $k$; more precisely these images (obtained, for each fixed $n$, inductively
via a classical algorithm in $k_n$) take place both in the $p$-class group $\mathcal{C}\ell_k$
and in the normalized $p$-adic regulator ${\mathcal R}_k$ of $k$ (recall that $\# {\mathcal T}_k
= \# \mathcal{C}\ell_k \# {\mathcal R}_k \# {\mathcal W}_k$, where the fixed field of ${\mathcal
W}_k$ is the Bertrandias--Payan field). A suitable assumption of uniform $p$-adic distribution
of these images, related to $\mathcal{C}\ell_k$ and ${\mathcal R}_k$, would constitute {\it a
proof} of Greenberg's conjecture, which remains hopeless within the sole framework of Iwasawa's
theory. We interpret the conjecture in terms of algorithmic complexity, governed by the arithmetic
structure of ${\mathcal T}_k$, for which some heuristics and probabilities, and possibly accessible
proofs, apply. No assumption is made on the degree of $k$ nor on the decomposition of $p$ in $k/\mathbb{Q}$.
