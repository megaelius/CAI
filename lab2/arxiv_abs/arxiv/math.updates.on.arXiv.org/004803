This paper is devoted to continuous and discrete adjoint-based optimization approaches for optimal
control problems governed by an important class of Nonlinear Coupled Anisotropic Convection-Diffusion
Chemotaxis-type System (NCACDCS). This study is motivated by the fact that the considered complex
systems (with complex geometries) appear in diverse biochemical, biological and biosocial criminology
problems. To solve numerically the corresponding nonlinear optimization problems, the primal
problem NCACDCS is discretised by a coupled Lattice Boltzmann Method with a general Multiple-Relaxation-Time
collision operators (MRT) while for the adjoint problem, an Adjoint Multiple-Relaxation-Time
lattice Boltzmann model (AMRT) is proposed and investigated. First, the optimal control problems
are formulated and first-order necessary optimality conditions are established by using sensitivity
and adjoint calculus. The resulting problems are discretised by the coupled MRT and AMRT models
and solved via gradient descent methods. First of all, an efficient and stable modified MRT model
for NCACDCS is developed, and through the Chapman-Enskog analysis we show that NCACDCS can be correctly
recovered from the proposed MRT model. For the adjoint problem, the discretisation strategy is
based on AMRT model, which is found to be as simple as MRT model with also highly-efficient parallel
nature. The derivation of AMRT model and the discrete cost functional gradient are derived mathematically
in detail using the developed MRT model. The obtained method is reliable, efficient, practical
to implement and can be easily incorporated into any existing MRT code.
