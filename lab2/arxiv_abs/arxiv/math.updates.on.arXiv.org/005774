During contraction the energy of muscle tissue increases due to energy from the hydrolysis of ATP.
This energy is distributed across the tissue as strain-energy potentials in the contractile elements,
strain-energy potential from the 3D deformation of the base-material tissue (containing cellular
and ECM effects), energy related to changes in the muscle's nearly incompressible volume and external
work done at the muscle surface. Thus, energy is redistributed through the muscle's tissue as it
contracts, with only a component of this energy being used to do mechanical work and develop forces
in the muscle's line-of-action. Understanding how the strain-energy potentials are redistributed
through the muscle tissue will help enlighten why the mechanical performance of whole muscle in
its line-of-action does not match the performance that would be expected from the contractile elements
alone. Here we demonstrate these physical effects using a 3D muscle model based on the finite element
method. The tissue deformations within contracting muscle are large, and so the mechanics of contraction
were explained using the principles of continuum mechanics for large deformations. We present
simulations of a contracting medial gastrocnemius muscle, showing tissue deformations that mirror
observations from MRI-based images. This paper tracks the redistribution of strain-energy potentials
through the muscle tissue during isometric contractions, and shows how fibre shortening, pennation
angle, transverse bulging and anisotropy in the stress and strain of the muscle tissue are all related
to the interaction between the material properties of the muscle and the action of the contractile
elements.
