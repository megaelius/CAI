To promote the implementation of realistic control over various complex networks, recent work
has been focusing on analyzing energy cost. Indeed, the energy cost quantifies how much effort is
required to drive the system from one state to another when it is fully controllable. A fully controllable
system means that the system can be driven by external inputs from any initial state to any final state
in finite time. However, it is prohibitively expensive and unnecessary to confine that the system
is fully controllable when we merely need to accomplish the so-called target control---controlling
a subnet of nodes chosen from the entire network. Yet, when the system is partially controllable,
the associated energy cost remains elusive. Here we present the minimum energy cost for controlling
an arbitrary subset of nodes of a network. Moreover, we systematically show the scaling behavior
of the precise upper and lower bounds of the minimum energy in term of the time given to accomplish
control. For controlling a given number of target nodes, we further demonstrate that the associated
energy over different configurations can differ by several orders of magnitude. When the adjacency
matrix of the network is nonsingular, we can simplify the framework by just considering the induced
subgraph spanned by target nodes instead of the entire network. Importantly, we find that, energy
cost could be saved by orders of magnitude as we only need the partial controllability of the entire
network. Our theoretical results are all corroborated by numerical calculations, and pave the
way for estimating the energy cost to implement realistic target control in various applications.
