The Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (LLL) is a probabilistic tool which shows that, if a collection of "bad"
events $\mathcal B$ in a probability space are not too likely and not too interdependent, then there
is a positive probability that no bad-events in $\mathcal B$ occur. Moser & Tardos (2010) gave sequential
and parallel algorithms which transformed most applications of the variable-assignment LLL into
efficient algorithms. A framework of Harvey & Vondr\'{a}k (2015) based on "resampling oracles"
extended this to general sequential algorithms for other probability spaces satisfying the Lopsided
Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (LLLL). We describe a new structural property which holds for all known resampling
oracles, which we call "obliviousness." Essentially, it means that the interaction between two
bad-events $B, B'$ depends only on the randomness used to resample $B$, and not the precise state
within $B$ itself. This property has two major consequences. First, combined with a framework of
Kolmogorov (2016), it is the key to achieving a unified parallel LLLL algorithm, which is faster
than previous, problem-specific algorithms of Harris (2016) for the variable-assignment LLLL
algorithm and of Harris \& Srinivasan (2014) for permutations. This gives the first RNC algorithms
for rainbow perfect matchings and rainbow hamiltonian cycles of $K_n$. Second, this property allows
us to build LLLL probability spaces out of relatively simple "atomic" events. This provides the
first sequential resampling oracle for rainbow perfect matchings on the complete $s$-uniform
hypergraph $K_n^{(s)}$, and the first commutative resampling oracle for hamiltonian cycles of
$K_n$.
