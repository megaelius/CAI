The problem of polar coding for an arbitrary sequence of independent binary-input memoryless symmetric
(BMS) channels $\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{N}$ is considered. Such a sequence of channels is
referred to as a non-stationary sequence of channels and arises in applications where data symbols
experience different and independent channel characteristics. The sequence of channels is assumed
to be completely known to both the transmitter and the receiver (a coherent scenario). Also, at each
code block transmission, each of the channels is used only once. In other words, a codeword of length
$N$ is constructed and then the $i$-th encoded bit is transmitted over $W_i$. The goal is to operate
at a rate $R$ close to the average symmetric capacities of $W_i$'s, denoted by $\overline{I}_N$.
To this end, we construct a polar coding scheme using Ar{\i}kan's channel polarization transform
in combination with certain permutations at each polarization level and certain skipped operations.
In particular, given a non-stationary sequence of BMS channels $\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{N}$
and $P_e$, where $0 < P_e <1$, we construct a polar code of length $N$ and rate $R$ guaranteeing a block
error probability of at most $P_e$ for transmission over $\left\{W_i\right\}_{i=1}^{N}$ such
that $$ N \leq \frac{\kappa}{(\overline{I}_N- R)^{\mu}}, $$ where $\mu$ is a constant and $\kappa$
is a constant depending on $P_e$ and $\mu$. We further show a numerical upper bound on $\mu$ that is:
$\mu \leq 10.78$. The encoding and decoding complexities of the constructed polar code preserve
$O(N \log N)$ complexity of Ar{\i}kan's polar codes.
