We complete the program of Ref. [3,5] of connecting totally non-negative Grassmannians to the reality
problem in KP finite-gap theory via the assignment of real regular divisors on rational degenerations
of M-curves for the class of real regular multi-line soliton solutions of KP II equation whose asymptotic
behavior has been combinatorially characterized by Chakravarthy, Kodama and Williams. We use
the plabic networks in the disk introduced by Postnikov to parametrize positroid cells in totally
nonnegative Grassmannians. The boundary of the disk corresponds to the rational curve associated
to the soliton data in the direct spectral problem, and the bicolored graph is the dual of a reducible
curve G which is the rational degeneration of a regular M-curve whose genus g equals the number of
faces of the network diminished by one. We assign systems of edge vectors to the planar bicolored
networks. The system of relations satisfied by them has maximal rank and may be reformulated in the
form of edge signatures.. We prove that the components of the edge vectors are rational in the edge
weights with subtraction free denominators and provide their explicit expressions in terms of
conservative and edge flows. The edge vectors rule the value of the KP wave function at the double
points of G, whereas the signatures at the vertices rule the position of the divisor in the ovals.
We prove that the divisor satisfies the conditions of Dubrovin-Natanzon for real finite-gap solutions:
there is exactly one divisor point in each oval except for the one containing the essential singularity
of the wave function. The divisor may be explicitly computed using the linear relations at the vertices
of the network. We explain the role of moves and reductions in the transformation of both the curve
and the divisor for given soliton data, and apply our construction to some examples.
