Equilibration to the steady state for a wide class of Luttinger liquid ballistic weakly linked tunnel
contacts is extensively studied. Quantum fluctuations of tunnel current are considered in all
orders in tunnel coupling and out of the equilibrium in the time domain. Especially, two important
mathematical statements: Self-equilibration (SE-)theorem and Self-equilibration (SE-)lemma
on the exact re-exponentiation of thermal average from the Keldysh-contour-ordered evolution
operator for arbitrary weakly linked Luttinger liquid tunnel contact are proven. Demonstrated
proof of SE-theorem and SE-lemma represents first evidence of a novel emergent phenomenon of "self-equilibration"
in the dynamics of quantum fluctuations of electron transport through ballistic tunnel junctions.
Corresponding differential equation of "self-equilibration" for time-dependent Keldysh partition
function of tunnel contact is derived and explained. It is shown that proven SE-theorem can be considered
also as the dynamical version of well-known Jarzynski equality for the tunnel electron transport
out of the equilibrium. As the result, exact time-dependent cumulant generating functional is
derived being valid at arbitrary electron-electron repulsion in the Luttinger liquid leads of
the junction, arbitrary temperature and arbitrary bias voltage. Respective general formula in
its long-time asymptote turns into a non-perturbative Luttinger liquid generalization of the
Levitov-Lesovik type of detailed balance formula for cumulant generating function. As the consequence
of obtained results, a universal character of self-equilibration of tunnel current in one-dimensional
weakly linked tunnel junctions is revealed and studied on the level of non-equilibrium Fano factor.
As well, a new measure of disequilibrium in such systems - the "steady flow" rate - is introduced and
discussed.
