We consider the calculation of Euler--Lagrange systems of ordinary difference equations, including
the difference Noether's Theorem, in the light of the recently developed calculus of difference
invariants and discrete moving frames. This leads naturally to the difference moving frame, a particular
type of discrete moving frame that is adapted to difference equations by prolongation conditions.
For any Lagrangian that is invariant under a Lie group action on the dependent variables, we show
that the Euler--Lagrange equations can be calculated directly in terms of the invariants of the
group action. We show further that Noether's conservation laws can be written in terms of a difference
moving frame and the invariants, and how this form of the laws can significantly ease the integration
problem. In fact, we show how to use the difference moving frame to help solve difference systems
that are given in terms of discrete invariants. We then show how the use of the conservation laws can
further simplify the calculations involved. In this paper, the examples involve scaling, translation
and rotation Lie groups. Apart from the study of systems that are inherently discrete, one significant
application is to obtain geometric (symplectic) integrators for variational systems, which have
the finite difference approximations of the conservation laws embedded, a priori. This is achieved
by taking an invariant finite difference Lagrangian in which the discrete invariants have the correct
continuum limit to their smooth counterparts. We show the calculations for a discretisation of
the Lagrangian for Euler's Elastica, and compare our discrete solution to that of its smooth continuum
limit.
