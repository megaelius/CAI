In this paper, we study a system of three evolutionary operator equations involving fractional
powers of selfadjoint, monotone, unbounded, linear operators having compact resolvents. This
system constitutes a generalized and relaxed version of a phase field system of Cahn-Hilliard type
modelling tumor growth that has originally been proposed in Hawkins-Daarud et al. (Int. J. Numer.
Math. Biomed. Eng. 28 (2012), 3-24). The original phase field system and certain relaxed versions
thereof have been studied in recent papers co-authored by the present authors and E. Rocca. The model
consists of a Cahn-Hilliard equation for the tumor cell fraction, coupled to a reaction-diffusion
equation for a function S representing the nutrient-rich extracellular water volume fraction.
Effects due to fluid motion are neglected. Motivated by the possibility that the diffusional regimes
governing the evolution of the different constituents of the model may be of different (e.g., fractional)
type, the present authors studied in a recent note a generalization of the systems investigated
in the abovementioned works. Under rather general assumptions, well-posedness and regularity
results have been shown. In particular, by writing the equation governing the evolution of the chemical
potential in the form of a general variational inequality, also singular or nonsmooth contributions
of logarithmic or of double obstacle type to the energy density could be admitted. In this note, we
perform an asymptotic analysis of the governing system as two (small) relaxation parameters approach
zero separately and simultaneously. Corresponding well-posedness and regularity results are
established for the respective cases; in particular, we give a detailed discussion which assumptions
on the admissible nonlinearities have to be postulated in each of the occurring cases.
