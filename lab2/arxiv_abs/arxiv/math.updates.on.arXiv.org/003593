There is a growing awareness that catastrophic phenomena in biology and medicine can be mathematically
represented in terms of saddle-node bifurcations. In particular, the term `tipping', or critical
transition has in recent years entered the discourse of the general public in relation to ecology,
medicine, and public health. The saddle-node bifurcation and its associated theory of catastrophe
as put forth by Thom and Zeeman has seen applications in a wide range of fields including molecular
biophysics, mesoscopic physics, and climate science. In this paper, we investigate a simple model
of a non-autonomous system with a time-dependent parameter $p(\tau)$ and its corresponding `dynamic'
(time-dependent) saddle-node bifurcation by the modern theory of non-autonomous dynamical systems.
We show that the actual point of no return for a system undergoing tipping can be significantly delayed
in comparison to the {\em breaking time} $\hat{\tau}$ at which the corresponding autonomous system
with a time-independent parameter $p_{a}= p(\hat{\tau})$ undergoes a bifurcation. A dimensionless
parameter $\alpha=\lambda p_0^3V^{-2}$ is introduced, in which $\lambda$ is the curvature of
the autonomous saddle-node bifurcation according to parameter $p(\tau)$, which has an initial
value of $p_{0}$ and a constant rate of change $V$. We find that the breaking time $\hat{\tau}$ is
always less than the actual point of no return $\tau^*$ after which the critical transition is irreversible;
specifically, the relation $\tau^*-\hat{\tau}\simeq 2.338(\lambda V)^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ is
analytically obtained. For a system with a small $\lambda V$, there exists a significant window
of opportunity $(\hat{\tau},\tau^*)$ during which rapid reversal of the environment can save
the system from catastrophe.
