Algorithms for convex feasibility find or approximate a point in the intersection of given closed
convex sets. Typically there are only finitely many convex sets, but the case of infinitely many
convex sets also has some applications. In this context, a \emph{string} is a finite sequence of
points each of which is obtained from the previous point by considering one of the convex sets. In
a \emph{string-averaging} algorithm, an iterative step from a first point to a second point computes
a number of strings, all starting with the first point, and then calculates a (weighted) average
of those strings' end-points: This average is that iterative step's second point, which is used
as the first point for the next iterative step. For string-averaging algorithms based on strings
in which each point is the projection of the previous point on one of the convex sets, we consider the
following question: "How can the iterative steps be specified so that the algorithm generates a
convergent sequence whose limit lies in the intersection of the sets of a given convex feasibility
problem?" Prior work on this question has assumed the given collection of convex sets is finite,
but this paper focuses on the case where the collection is (countably) infinite. Theorems that answer
the question are presented. Additionally, we give counterexamples that show the generated sequence
may fail to converge or may converge to a point that is not in the intersection if conditions of the
theorems are not satisfied. The string-averaging algorithms that are shown to generate a convergent
sequence whose limit lies in the intersection are shown to also be perturbation resilient, so they
can be superiorized to generate sequences that also converge to a point of the intersection but in
a manner that is superior with respect to some application-dependent criterion.
