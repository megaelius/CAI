on the '$k$-shifted symplectic derived algebraic geometry' of Pantev, Toen, Vaquie and Vezzosi,
arXiv:1111.3209 . This paper extends the previous three from (derived) schemes to (derived) Artin
stacks. We prove four main results: (a) If $(X,\omega)$ is a $k$-shifted symplectic derived Artin
stack for $k<0$ in the sense of arXiv:1111.3209 , then near each $x\in X$ we can find a 'minimal'
smooth atlas $\varphi:U\to X$ with $U$ an affine derived scheme, such that $(U,\varphi^*(\omega))$
may be written explicitly in coordinates in a standard 'Darboux form'. (b) If $(X,\omega)$ is a $-1$-shifted
symplectic derived Artin stack and $X'$ the underlying classical Artin stack, then $X'$ extends
naturally to a 'd-critical stack' $(X',s)$ in the sense of arXiv:1304.4508 . (c) If $(X,s)$ is an
oriented d-critical stack, we can define a natural perverse sheaf $P^\bullet_{X,s}$ on $X$, such
that whenever $T$ is a scheme and $t:T\to X$ is smooth of relative dimension $n$, then $T$ is locally
modelled on a critical locus Crit$(f:U\to{\mathbb A}^1)$ for $U$ smooth, and $t^*(P^\bullet_{X,s})[n]$
is locally modelled on the perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles $PV_{U,f}^\bullet$ of $f$. (d) If
$(X,s)$ is a finite type oriented d-critical stack, we can define a natural motive $MF_{X,s}$ in
a ring of motives $\bar{\mathcal M}^{st,\hat\mu}_X$ on $X$, such that whenever $T$ is a finite type
scheme and $t:T\to X$ is smooth of dimension $n$, then $T$ is locally modelled on a critical locus
Crit$(f:U\to{\mathbb A}^1)$ for $U$ smooth, and ${\mathbb L}^{-n/2}\odot t^*(MF_{X,s})$ is
locally modelled on the motivic vanishing cycle $MF^{mot,\phi}_{U,f}$ of $f$ in $\bar{\mathcal
M}^{st,\hat\mu}_T$. Our results have applications to categorified and motivic extensions of
