Many physics problems have $J(x)=L(x)E(x)+h(x)$, source $h(x)$, fields $E$,$J$ satisfying differential
constraints, symbolized by $E\in\cal E$,$J\in\cal J$ where $\cal E$,$\cal J$ are orthogonal spaces.
If $L(x)$ takes values in certain nonlinear manifolds $\cal M$, and coercivity, boundedness hold,
then the Green's function satisfies exact identities. We also link Green's functions of different
problems. The analysis, based on the theory of exact relations for composites, does not assume microscale
variations in $L(x)$, and allows for other equations, such as for waves in lossy media. For bodies
$\Omega$, in which $L(x)\in{\cal M}$, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map satisfies boundary field
equalities. These generalize the notion of conservation laws: the constraints on the fields inside
$\Omega$ give identities satisfied by the boundary fields, and provide extra constraints on the
interior fields. A consequence is this: if a matrix valued field $Q(x)$ with $\nabla\cdot Q=0$ takes
values in a set $\cal B$ (independent of $x$) that lies on a nonlinear manifold, we find conditions
on the manifold, and on $\cal B$, that with appropriate conditions on the boundary fluxes $q(x)=n(x)\cdot
Q(x)$ (where $n(x)$ is the outwards normal to $\partial\Omega$) force $Q(x)$ within $\Omega$ to
take values in a subspace $\cal D$. This forces $q(x)$ to take values in $n(x)\cdot\cal D$. We find
there are additional divergence free fields inside $\Omega$ that in turn generate additional boundary
field equalities. There exist partial Null-Lagrangians, functionals $F(w,\nabla w)$ of a vector
potential $w$ and its gradient, that act as null-Lagrangians when $\nabla w$ is constrained for
$x\in\Omega$ to take values in certain sets $\cal A$, of appropriate non-linear manifolds, and
when $w$ satisfies appropriate boundary conditions. The extension to certain non-linear minimization
problems is also sketched.
