Consider a simplicial complex that allows for an embedding into $\mathbb{R}^d$. How many faces
of dimension $\frac{d}{2}$ or higher can it have? How dense can they be? This basic question goes
back to Descartes' "Lost Theorem" and Euler's work on polyhedra. Using it and other fundamental
combinatorial problems, we will introduce a version of the K\"ahler package beyond positivity,
allowing us to prove the Lefschetz theorem for toric varieties even when the ample cone is empty.
A particular focus lies on replacing the Hodge-Riemann relations by a non-degeneracy relation
at torus-invariant subspaces, allowing us to state and prove a generalization of theorems of Hall
and Laman in the setting of toric varieties and beyond. This has several applications, among them
the following: - We fully characterize the possible face numbers of simplicial rational homology
spheres, resolving the $g$-conjecture of McMullen in full generality and generalizing Stanley's
earlier proof for simplicial polytopes. This has several interesting consequences in geometric
topology. For instance, if $M$ is a triangulated closed $(d-1)$-manifold on $n$ vertices, then
\[\binom{d+1}{j}\mathrm{b}_{j-1}(M)\ \le \ \binom{n-d+j-2}{j}\ \quad \text{for}\ 1\le j\le
\frac{d}{2}\] which verifies a conjecture of K\"uhnel. - We prove that for a simplicial complex
$\varDelta$ that embeds into $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, the number of $d$-dimensional simplices exceeds
the number of $(d-1)$-dimensional simplices by a factor of at most $d+2$. This generalizes a result
going back to Descartes and Euler, and resolves the Gr\"unbaum-Kalai-Sarkaria conjecture.
