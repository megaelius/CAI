The sample frequency spectrum (SFS), which describes the distribution of mutant alleles in a sample
of DNA sequences, is a widely used summary statistic in population genetics. The expected SFS has
a strong dependence on the historical population demography and this property is exploited by popular
statistical methods to infer complex demographic histories from DNA sequence data. Most, if not
all, of these inference methods exhibit pathological behavior, however. Specifically, they often
display runaway behavior in optimization, where the inferred population sizes and epoch durations
can degenerate to 0 or diverge to infinity, and show undesirable sensitivity of the inferred demography
to perturbations in the data. The goal of this paper is to provide theoretical insights into why such
problems arise. To this end, we characterize the geometry of the expected SFS for piecewise-constant
demographic histories and use our results to show that the aforementioned pathological behavior
of popular inference methods is intrinsic to the geometry of the expected SFS. We provide explicit
descriptions and visualizations for a toy model with sample size 4, and generalize our intuition
to arbitrary sample sizes n using tools from convex and algebraic geometry. We also develop a universal
characterization result which shows that the expected SFS of a sample of size n under an arbitrary
population history can be recapitulated by a piecewise-constant demography with only k(n) epochs,
where k(n) is between n/2 and 2n-1. The set of expected SFS for piecewise-constant demographies
with fewer than k(n) epochs is open and non-convex, which causes the above phenomena for inference
from data.
