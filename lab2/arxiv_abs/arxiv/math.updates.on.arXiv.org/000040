It is well-known that the traditional Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is not robust in the sense
that a small error in a remainder may cause a large error in the reconstruction solution. A robust
CRT was recently proposed for a special case when the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the moduli
is more than 1 and the remaining integers factorized by the gcd of all the moduli are co-prime. In this
special case, a closed-form reconstruction from erroneous remainders was proposed and a necessary
and sufficient condition on the remainder errors was obtained. It basically says that the reconstruction
error is upper bounded by the remainder error level $\tau$ if $\tau$ is smaller than a quarter of the
gcd of all the moduli. In this paper, we consider the robust reconstruction problem for a general
set of moduli. We first present a necessary and sufficient condition for the remainder errors for
a robust reconstruction from erroneous remainders with a general set of muduli and also a corresponding
robust reconstruction method. This can be thought of as a single stage robust CRT. We then propose
a two-stage robust CRT by grouping the moduli into several groups as follows. First, the single stage
robust CRT is applied to each group. Then, with these robust reconstructions from all the groups,
the single stage robust CRT is applied again across the groups. This is then easily generalized to
multi-stage robust CRT. Interestingly, with this two-stage robust CRT, the robust reconstruction
holds even when the remainder error level $\tau$ is above the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli.
In this paper, we also propose an algorithm on how to group a set of moduli for a better reconstruction
robustness of the two-stage robust CRT in some special cases.
