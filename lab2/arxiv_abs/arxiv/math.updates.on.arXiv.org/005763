To date, social network analysis has been largely focused on pairwise interactions. The study of
higher-order interactions, via a hypergraph network, brings in new insights. We study community
detection in a hypergraph network. A popular approach is to project the hypergraph to a graph and
then apply community detection methods for graph networks, but we show that this approach may cause
unwanted information loss. We propose a new method for community detection that operates directly
on the hypergraph. At the heart of our method is a regularized higher-order orthogonal iteration
(reg-HOOI) algorithm that computes an approximate low-rank decomposition of the network adjacency
tensor. Compared with existing tensor decomposition methods such as HOSVD and vanilla HOOI, reg-HOOI
yields better performance, especially when the hypergraph is sparse. Given the output of tensor
decomposition, we then generalize the community detection method SCORE (Jin, 2015) from graph
networks to hypergraph networks. We call our new method Tensor-SCORE. In theory, we introduce a
degree-corrected block model for hypergraphs (hDCBM), and show that Tensor-SCORE yields consistent
community detection for a wide range of network sparsity and degree heterogeneity. As a byproduct,
we derive the rates of convergence on estimating the principal subspace by reg-HOOI, with different
initializations, including the two new initialization methods we propose, a diagonal-removed
HOSVD and a randomized graph projection. We apply our method to several real hypergraph networks
which yields encouraging results. It suggests that exploring higher-order interactions provides
additional information not seen in graph representations.
