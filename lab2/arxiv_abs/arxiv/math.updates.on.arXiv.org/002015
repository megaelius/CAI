For a finite collection $\mathbf A=(A_i)_{i\in I}$ of locally closed sets in $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geqslant3$,
with the sign $\pm1$ prescribed such that the oppositely charged plates are mutually disjoint,
we consider the minimum energy problem relative to the $\alpha$-Riesz kernel $|x-y|^{\alpha-n}$,
$\alpha\in(0,2]$, over positive vector Radon measures $\boldsymbol\mu=(\mu^i)_{i\in I}$ such
that each $\mu^i$, $i\in I$, is carried by $A_i$ and normalized by $\mu^i(A_i)=a_i\in(0,\infty)$.
We show that, though the closures of oppositely charged plates may intersect each other even in a
set of nonzero capacity, this problem has a solution $\boldsymbol\lambda^{\boldsymbol\xi}_{\mathbf
A}=(\lambda^i_{\mathbf A})_{i\in I}$ (also in the presence of an external field) if we restrict
ourselves to $\boldsymbol\mu$ with $\mu^i\leqslant\xi^i$, $i\in I$, where the constraint $\boldsymbol\xi=(\xi^i)_{i\in
I}$ is properly chosen. We establish the sharpness of the sufficient conditions on the solvability
thus obtained, provide descriptions of the weighted vector $\alpha$-Riesz potentials of the solutions,
single out their characteristic properties, and analyze the supports of the $\lambda^i_{\mathbf
A}$, $i\in I$. Our approach is based on the simultaneous use of the vague topology and an appropriate
semimetric structure defined in terms of the $\alpha$-Riesz energy on a set of vector measures associated
with $\mathbf A$, as well as on the establishment of an intimate relationship between the constrained
minimum $\alpha$-Riesz energy problem and a constrained minimum $\alpha$-Green energy problem,
suitably formulated. The results are illustrated by examples.
