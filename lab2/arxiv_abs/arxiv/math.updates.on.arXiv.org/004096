The first step towards applying isogeometric analysis techniques to solve PDE problems on a given
domain consists in generating an analysis-suitable mapping operator between parametric and physical
domains with one or several patches from no more than a description of the boundary contours of the
physical domain. A subclass of the multitude of the available parameterization algorithms are
those based on the principles of Elliptic Grid Generation (EGG) which, in their most basic form,
attempt to approximate a mapping operator whose inverse is composed of harmonic functions. The
main challenge lies in finding a formulation of the problem that is suitable for a computational
approach and a common strategy is to approximate the mapping operator by means of solving a PDE-problem.
PDE-based EGG is well-established in classical meshing and first generalization attempts to spline-based
descriptions (as is mandatory in IgA) have been made. Unfortunately, all of the practically viable
PDE-based approaches impose certain requirements on the employed spline-basis, in particular
global $C^{\geq 1}$-continuity. This paper discusses a PDE-based EGG-algorithm for the generation
of planar parameterizations with arbitrary continuity properties (where arbitrary stands for
spline bases with global $C^{\geq 0}$-continuity). A major use case of the proposed algorithm is
that of multi-patch parameterization, made possible by the support of $C^{\geq 0}$-continuities.
This paper proposes a specially-taylored solution algorithm that exploits many characteristics
of the PDE-problem and is suitable for large-scale applications. It is discussed for the single-patch
case before generalizing its concepts to multipatch settings. This paper is concluded with three
numerical experiments and a discussion of the results.
