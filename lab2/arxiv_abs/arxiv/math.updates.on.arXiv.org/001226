Solving the Fokker-Planck equation for high-dimensional complex turbulent dynamical systems
is an important and practical issue. However, most traditional methods suffer from the curse of
dimensionality and have difficulties in capturing the fat tailed highly intermittent probability
density functions (PDFs) of complex systems in turbulence, neuroscience and excitable media.
In this article, efficient statistically accurate algorithms are developed for solving both the
transient and the equilibrium solutions of Fokker-Planck equations associated with high-dimensional
nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems with conditional Gaussian structures. The algorithms
involve a hybrid strategy that requires only a small number of ensembles. Here, a conditional Gaussian
mixture in a high-dimensional subspace via an extremely efficient parametric method is combined
with a judicious non-parametric Gaussian kernel density estimation in the remaining low-dimensional
subspace. Particularly, the parametric method provides closed analytical formulae for determining
the conditional Gaussian distributions in the high-dimensional subspace and is therefore computationally
efficient and accurate. The full non-Gaussian PDF of the system is then given by a Gaussian mixture.
Different from the traditional particle methods, each conditional Gaussian distribution here
covers a significant portion of the high-dimensional PDF. Therefore a small number of ensembles
is sufficient to recover the full PDF, which overcomes the curse of dimensionality. Notably, the
mixture distribution has a significant skill in capturing the transient behavior with fat tails
of the high-dimensional non-Gaussian PDFs, and this facilitates the algorithms in accurately
describing the intermittency and extreme events in complex turbulent systems.
