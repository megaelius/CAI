Cherednik's type A quantum affine Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations form a consistent system
of linear $q$-difference equations for $V_n$-valued meromorphic functions on a complex $n$-torus,
with $V_n$ a module over the $\mathrm{GL}_n$-type extended affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$.
The family $(\mathcal{H}_n)_{n\geq 0}$ of extended affine Hecke algebras forms a tower of algebras,
with the associated algebra morphisms $\mathcal{H}_n\rightarrow\mathcal{H}_{n+1}$ the Hecke
algebra descends of arc insertion at the affine braid group level. In this paper we consider twisted-symmetric
polynomial solutions $f^{(n)}$ ($n\geq 0$) of the qKZ equations that are compatible with the tower
structure on $(\mathcal{H}_n)_{n\geq 0}$. The compatibility is encoded by so-called braid recursion
relations: $f^{(n+1)}(z_1,\ldots,z_{n},0)$ is required to coincide up to a quasi-constant factor
with the push-forward of $f^{(n)}(z_1,\ldots,z_{n})$ by an intertwiner $\mu_{n}: V_{n}\rightarrow
V_{n+1}$ of $\mathcal{H}_{n}$-modules, where $V_{n+1}$ is considered as an $\mathcal{H}_{n}$-module
through the above mentioned tower structure on $(\mathcal{H}_n)_{n\geq 0}$. We provide two towers
$(f^{(n)})_{n\geq 0}$ of solutions of qKZ equations in this paper, and describe the associated
braid recursion relations explicitly. In the first example, $f^{(n)}$ is taken to be the (suitably
normalized) ground state of the inhomogeneous dense $O(1)$ loop model on the half-infinite cylinder
with circumference $n$. In this example the extended affine Hecke algebra parameter is a third root
of unity. The second example provides a natural extension of this tower of solutions to generic values
of the affine Hecke algebra parameter. In this case $f^{(n)}$ is constructed from nonsymmetric
Macdonald polynomials using the Cherednik-Matsuo correspondence.
