This article provides a mathematical analysis of singular (nonsmooth) artifacts added to reconstructions
by filtered backprojection (FBP) type algorithms for X-ray CT with arbitrary incomplete data.
We prove that these singular artifacts arise from points at the boundary of the data set. Our results
show that, depending on the geometry of this boundary, two types of artifacts can arise: object-dependent
and object-independent artifacts. Object-dependent artifacts are generated by singularities
of the object being scanned and these artifacts can extend all along lines. They generalize the streak
artifacts observed in limited-angle tomography. Object-independent artifacts, on the other
hand, are essentially independent of the object and take one of two forms: streaks on lines if the
boundary of the data set is not smooth at a point and curved artifacts if the boundary is smooth locally.
We prove that these streak and curve artifacts are the only singular artifacts that can occur for
FBP in the continuous case. In addition to the geometric description of artifacts, the article provides
characterizations of their strength in Sobolev scale in certain cases. The results of this article
apply to the well-known incomplete data problems, including limited-angle and region-of-interest
tomography, as well as to unconventional X-ray CT imaging setups that arise in new practical applications.
Reconstructions from simulated and real data are analyzed to illustrate our theorems, including
the reconstruction that motivated this work---a synchrotron data set in which artifacts appear
on lines that have no relation to the object.
