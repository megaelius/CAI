We study stochastic Komatu-Loewner evolutions in multiply connected planar domains. Let $D$ be
a standard slit domain and a Jordan arc $\gamma$ in $D$ starting at $\partial {\mathbb H}$. For each
$t$, there is a unique conformal map $g_t$ from $D\setminus \gamma[0,t]$ onto a standard slit domain
$D_t=\mathbb{H}\setminus \cup_{k=1}^N C_k(t)$ satisfying the hydrodynamic normalization
at infinity. The conformal mapping $g_t$ satisfies an ODE in $t$ called a Komatu-Loewner equation
Suppose $\gamma$ is a random Jordan whose distribution enjoys a domain Markov property and a certain
conformal invariance property. We show that the induced process $(\xi(t), {\bf s}(t))$ satisfies
a Markov type stochastic differential equation, where $\xi(t)$ is a motion on $\partial\mathbb{H}$
and ${\bf s}(t)$ represents the motion of the endpoints of the slits $\{C_k(t),\; 1\le k\le N \}.$
The diffusion and drift coefficients $\alpha$ and $b$ of $\xi(t)$ are homogeneous functions of
degree $0$ and $-1$, respectively, while ${\bf s}(t)$ has drift coefficients only, determined
by the Brownian motion with darning (BMD) complex Poisson kernel that are known to be Lipschitz continuous.
Conversely, given such functions $\alpha$ and $b$ with local Lipschitz continuity, the corresponding
SDE admits a unique solution $(\xi(t), {\bf s}(t))$. The latter produces random conformal maps
$g_t(z)$ via the Komatu-Loewner equation. The resulting family of random growing hulls $\{F_t\}$
from the conformal mappings is called ${\rm SKLE}_{\alpha,b}.$ We show that it enjoys a certain
scaling property and a domain Markov property. Among other things, we further prove that ${\rm SKLE}_{\alpha,b}$
has a locality property if $\alpha = \pm \sqrt{6}$ and $b=-b_{\rm BMD}$, where $b_{\rm BMD}$ is a
BMD-domain constant that describes the discrepancy of a standard slit domain from $\mathbb{H}$
relative to BMD.
