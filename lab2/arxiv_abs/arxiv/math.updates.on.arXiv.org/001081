This paper develops an analytic framework to design both stress and stretching/compressing T-periodic
loadings which make the quasi-static evolution of a one-dimensional network of elastoplastic
springs converging to a unique periodic regime. The solution of such an evolution problem is a function
$t\mapsto(e(t),p(t)),$ where $e_i(t)$ and $p_i(t)$ are the elastic and plastic deformations
of spring $i,$ defined on $[t_0,\infty)$ by the initial condition $(e(t_0),p(t_0))$. After we
rigorously convert the problem into a Moreau sweeping process with a moving polyhedron $C(t)$ in
a vector space $E$ of dimension $d,$ it becomes natural to expect (based on a result by Krejci) that
the solution $t\mapsto(e(t),p(t))$ always converges to a T-periodic function. The achievement
of this paper is in spotting a class of sweeping processes and closed-form estimates on eligible
loadings where the Krejci's limit doesn't depend on the initial condition $(e(t_0),p(t_0))$ and
so all the trajectories approach the same T-periodic solution. The proposed class of sweeping processes
is the one for which the normals of any $d$ different facets of the moving polyhedron $C(t)$ are linearly
independent. We further link this geometric condition to mechanical properties of the given network
of springs. We discover that the normals of any $d$ different facets of the moving polyhedron $C(t)$
are linearly independent, if the number of stretching/compressing constraints is 2 less the number
of nodes of the given network of springs and when the magnitude of the stress loading is sufficiently
large (but admissible). In other words, we offer an analogue of the high-gain control method for
elastoplastic systems, which can be used to design the properties of rheological models of materials
(e.g. in creating smart materials).
