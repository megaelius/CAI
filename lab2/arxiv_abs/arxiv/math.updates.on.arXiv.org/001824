We consider the varieties of singular $m \times m$ complex matrices which may be either general,
symmetric or skew-symmetric (with $m$ even). For these varieties we have shown in another paper
that they had compact "model submanifolds", for the homotopy types of the Milnor fibers which are
classical symmetric spaces in the sense of Cartan. In this paper we use these models, combined with
results due to a number of authors concerning the Schubert decomposition of Lie groups, symmetric
spaces via the Cartan model together with Iwasawa decomposition to give a cell decomposition of
the global Milnor fibers. The Schubert decomposition is in terms of "unique ordered factorizations"
of matrices in the Milnor fibers as products of " pseudo-rotations". In the case of symmetric or skew-symmetric
matrices, this factorization has the form of iterated "Cartan conjugacies" by pseudo-rotations.
The "Schubert cycles" (the closures of the Schubert cells), are images of products of suspensions
of projective spaces (complex, real, or quaternionic). For general or skew-symmetric matrices
the Schubert cycles have fundamental classes, and for symmetric matrices $\mod 2$ classes, giving
a basis for the homology, corresponding to the cohomology generators for the symmetric spaces.
For general matrices the duals of the Schubert cycles are given as explicit monomials in the generators
of the exterior cohomology algebra; and for symmetric matrices they are related to Stiefel-Whitney
classes of an associated vector bundle. Furthermore, for any matrix singularity of these types
the pull-backs of these cohomolgy classes generate a characteristic subalgebra of the cohomology
of the Milnor fiber. These results extend to exceptional orbit hypersurfaces, complements and
links.
