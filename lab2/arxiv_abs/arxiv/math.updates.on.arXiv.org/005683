Let $\mathcal P$ be the space of probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$. We associate a coupled nonlinear
Fokker-Planck equation on $\mathbb R^d$, i.e. with solution paths in $\mathcal P$, to a linear Fokker-Planck
equation for probability measures on the product space $\mathbb R^d\times \mathcal P$, i.e. with
solution paths in $\mathcal P(\mathbb R^d\times\mathcal P)$. We explicitly determine the corresponding
linear Kolmogorov operator $\mathbf{L}_t$ using the natural tangent bundle over $\mathcal P$
with corresponding gradient operator $\nabla^{\mathcal P}$. Then it is proved that the diffusion
process generated by $\mathbf{L}_t$ on $\mathbb R^d\times\mathcal P$ is intrinsically related
to the solution of a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE). We also characterize
the ergodicity of the diffusion process generated by $\mathbf{L}_t$ in terms of asymptotic properties
of the coupled nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. Another main result of the paper is that the restricted
well-posedness of the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation and its linearized version imply the
(restricted) well-posedness of the McKean-Vlasov equation and that in this case the laws of the
solutions have the Markov property. As applications, we prove the restricted weak well-posedness
and the Markov property of the so-called nonlinear distorted Brownian motion, whose associated
nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation is a porous media equation perturbed by a nonlinear transport
term. As a further application we obtain a probabilistic representation of solutions to Schr\"odinger
type PDEs on $\mathbb R^d\times\mathcal P_2$, through the Feynman-Kac formula for the corresponding
diffusion processes.
