Let $H$ be a multiplicatively written monoid. Given $k\in{\bf N}^+$, we denote by $\mathscr U_k$
the set of all $\ell\in{\bf N}^+$ such that $a_1\cdots a_k=b_1\cdots b_\ell$ for some atoms $a_1,\ldots,a_k,b_1,\ldots,b_\ell\in
H$. The sets $\mathscr U_k$ are one of the most fundamental invariants studied in the theory of non-unique
factorization, and understanding their structure is a basic problem in the field: In particular,
it is known that, in many cases of interest, these sets are almost arithmetic progressions with the
same difference and bound for all large $k$, namely, $H$ satisfies the Structure Theorem for Unions.
The present paper improves the current state of the art on this problem. More precisely, we show that,
under mild assumptions, the following holds: There are $M\in\bf N$, $d,\mu\in{\bf N}^+$, and $\mathscr{U}_0^\prime,\mathscr{U}_0^{\prime\prime},\ldots,\mathscr{U}_{\mu-1}^\prime,\mathscr{U}_{\mu-1}^{\prime\prime}\subseteq
[\![0,M]\!]$ such that, for all large $k$, $$\mathscr U_k=\bigl(\inf\mathscr U_k+\mathscr U_{k\bmod\mu}^\prime\bigr)\uplus\mathscr{P}_k\uplus\bigl(\sup\mathscr
U_k-\mathscr U_{k\bmod\mu}^{\prime\prime}\bigr)\subseteq k+d\cdot{\bf Z},$$ where $\mathscr
P_k := (k+d\cdot{\bf Z})\cap [\![\inf\mathscr U_k+M,\sup\mathscr U_k-M]\!]$ is an AP. The result
applies, e.g., to (the multiplicative monoid of) all commutative Krull domains with finite class
group; a variety of weakly Krull commutative domains (including all orders in number fields with
finite elasticity); some maximal orders in central simple algebras over global fields; and all
numerical monoids. Large parts of the proofs are worked out in a "purely additive model", by inquiring
into the properties of what we call a subadditive family, i.e., a collection $\mathscr L$ of subsets
of $\bf N$ such that, for all $L_1,L_2\in\mathscr L$, there is $L\in\mathscr L$ with $L_1+L_2\subseteq
L$.
