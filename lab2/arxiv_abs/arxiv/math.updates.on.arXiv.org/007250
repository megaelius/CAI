A bramble in an undirected graph $G$ is a family of connected subgraphs of $G$ such that for every two
subgraphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ in the bramble either $V(H_1) \cap V(H_2) \neq \emptyset$ or there is an
edge of $G$ with one endpoint in $V(H_1)$ and the second endpoint in $V(H_2)$. The order of the bramble
is the minimum size of a vertex set that intersects all elements of a bramble. Brambles are objects
dual to treewidth: As shown by Seymour and Thomas, the maximum order of a bramble in an undirected
graph $G$ equals one plus the treewidth of $G$. However, as shown by Grohe and Marx, brambles of high
order may necessarily be of exponential size: In a constant-degree $n$-vertex expander a bramble
of order $\Omega(n^{1/2+\delta})$ requires size exponential in $\Omega(n^{2\delta})$ for any
fixed $\delta \in (0,\frac{1}{2}]$. On the other hand, the combination of results of Grohe and Marx
and Chekuri and Chuzhoy shows that a graph of treewidth $k$ admits a bramble of order $\widetilde{\Omega}(k^{1/2})$
and size $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{3/2})$. ($\widetilde{\Omega}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}$
hide polylogarithmic factors and divisors, respectively.) In this note, we first sharpen the second
bound by proving that every graph $G$ of treewidth at least $k$ contains a bramble of order $\widetilde{\Omega}(k^{1/2})$
and congestion $2$, i.e., every vertex of $G$ is contained in at most two elements of the bramble (thus
the bramble is of size linear in its order). Second, we provide a tight upper bound for the lower bound
of Grohe and Marx: For every $\delta \in (0,\frac{1}{2}]$, every graph $G$ of treewidth at least
$k$ contains a bramble of order $\widetilde{\Omega}(k^{1/2+\delta})$ and size $2^{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{2\delta})}$.
