Starting from a (small) rigid C$^*$-tensor category $\mathscr{C}$ with simple unit, we construct
von Neumann algebras associated to each of its objects. These algebras are factors and can be either
semifinite (of type II$_1$ or II$_\infty$, depending on whether the spectrum of the category is
finite or infinite) or they can be of type III$_\lambda$, $\lambda\in (0,1]$. The choice of type
is tuned by the choice of Tomita structure (defined in the paper) on certain bimodules we use in the
construction. Moreover, if the spectrum is infinite we realize the whole tensor category directly
as endomorphisms of these algebras, with finite Jones index, by exhibiting a fully faithful unitary
tensor functor $F:\mathscr{C} \hookrightarrow End_0(\Phi)$ where $\Phi$ is a factor (of type
II or III). The construction relies on methods from free probability (full Fock space, amalgamated
free products), it does not depend on amenability assumptions, and it can be applied to categories
with uncountable spectrum (hence it provides an alternative answer to a conjecture of Yamagami
\cite{Y3}). Even in the case of uncountably generated categories, we can refine the previous equivalence
to obtain realizations on $\sigma$-finite factors as endomorphisms (in the type III case) and as
bimodules (in the type II case). In the case of trivial Tomita structure, we recover the same algebra
obtained in \cite{PopaS} and \cite{AMD}, namely the (countably generated) free group factor $L(F_\infty)$
if the given category has denumerable spectrum, while we get the free group factor with uncountably
many generators if the spectrum is infinite and non-denumerable.
