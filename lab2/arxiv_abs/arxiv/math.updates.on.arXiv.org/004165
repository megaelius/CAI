Let $M$ be a regular matroid. The Jacobian group ${\rm Jac}(M)$ of $M$ is a finite abelian group whose
cardinality is equal to the number of bases of $M$. This group generalizes the definition of the Jacobian
group (also known as the critical group or sandpile group) ${\rm Jac}(G)$ of a graph $G$ (in which
case bases of the corresponding regular matroid are spanning trees of $G$). There are many explicit
combinatorial bijections in the literature between the Jacobian group of a graph ${\rm Jac}(G)$
and spanning trees. However, most of the known bijections use vertices of $G$ in some essential way
and are inherently "non-matroidal". In this paper, we construct a family of explicit and easy-to-describe
bijections between the Jacobian group of a regular matroid $M$ and bases of $M$, many instances of
which are new even in the case of graphs. We first describe our family of bijections in a purely combinatorial
way in terms of orientations; more specifically, we prove that the Jacobian group of $M$ admits a
canonical simply transitive action on the set ${\mathcal G}(M)$ of circuit-cocircuit reversal
classes of $M$, and then define a family of combinatorial bijections $\beta_{\sigma,\sigma^*}$
between ${\mathcal G}(M)$ and bases of $M$. (Here $\sigma$ (resp. $\sigma^*$) is an acyclic signature
of the set of circuits (resp. cocircuits) of $M$.) We then give a geometric interpretation of each
such map $\beta=\beta_{\sigma,\sigma^*}$ in terms of zonotopal subdivisions which is used to
verify that $\beta$ is indeed a bijection. Finally, we give a combinatorial interpretation of lattice
points in the zonotope $Z$; by passing to dilations we obtain a new derivation of Stanley's formula
linking the Ehrhart polynomial of $Z$ to the Tutte polynomial of $M$.
