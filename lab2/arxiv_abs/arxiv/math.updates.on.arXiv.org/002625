We consider examples of the Yang-Baxter equation previously introduced by the first three authors
and Gray in connection with metaplectic Whittaker functions. These examples only partially fit
into the usual framework that relates quantum groups and solvable lattice models. The $R$-matrix
that solves the system agrees with the $R$-matrix of the quantum affine superalgebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n|1))$
for the defining representation, but the entire solution of the Yang-Baxter equation cannot be
interpreted in terms of finite dimensional modules of that quantum group. To better fit these examples
into a quantum group framework, we explain the solvable lattice models in terms of the quantum Fock
space representation of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n))$ introduced by Kashiwara, Miwa and
Stern. Our main theorem interprets the row transfer matrices as vertex operators on the quantum
Fock space that intertwines the action of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n))$. We then introduce
new symmetric functions that we call \textit{metaplectic symmetric functions}. These are closely
related to specializations of super LLT polynomials, which are generalizations of the \textit{ribbon
symmetric functions} of Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon. We discuss the representation of LLT polynomials
through a similar formalism of vertex operators. For applications to the theory of metaplectic
Whittaker functions we will expand the framework of~\cite{KMS} by Drinfeld twisting to introduce
Gauss sums into the $R$-matrix. We also explain how Whittaker functions on the $n$-fold metaplectic
cover of GL$_r$ can be related to metaplectic symmetric functions.
