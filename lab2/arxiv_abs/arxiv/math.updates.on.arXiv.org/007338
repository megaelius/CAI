Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public health control strategies have
been proposed and tested against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We study three specific COVID-19
epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination
control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected,
quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the
control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages)
which can specify the expected control outcomes such as "the deaths from the infection should never
exceed one thousand per day within the next three months" or "the population immune from the disease
should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days". We then develop methods for
synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic
models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies:
vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy,
Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from
data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters
estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate
control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious,
immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential
in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications.
