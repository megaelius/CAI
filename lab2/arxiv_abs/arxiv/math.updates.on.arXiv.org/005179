Four quantities are fundamental in homogenization of elliptic systems in divergence form and in
its applications: the field and the flux of the solution operator (applied to a general deterministic
right-hand side), and the field and the flux of the corrector. Homogenization is the study of the
large-scale properties of these objects. In case of random coefficients, these quantities fluctuate
and their fluctuations are a priori unrelated. Depending on the law of the coefficient field, and
in particular on the decay of its correlations on large scales, these fluctuations may display different
scalings and different limiting laws (if any). In this contribution, we identify another crucial
intrinsic quantity, motivated by H-convergence, which we refer to as the \emph{homogenization
commutator} and is related to variational quantities first considered by Armstrong and Smart.
In the simplified setting of the random conductance model, we show what we believe to be a general
principle, namely that the homogenization commutator drives at leading order the fluctuations
of each of the four other quantities in a strong norm in probability, which is expressed in form of
a suitable two-scale expansion and reveals the \emph{pathwise structure} of fluctuations in stochastic
homogenization. In addition, we show that the (rescaled) homogenization commutator converges
in law to a Gaussian white noise, and we analyze to which precision the covariance tensor that characterizes
the latter can be extracted from the representative volume element method. This collection of results
constitutes a new theory of fluctuations in stochastic homogenization that holds in any dimension
and yields optimal rates. Extensions to the (non-symmetric) continuum setting are also discussed,
the details of which are postponed to forthcoming works.
