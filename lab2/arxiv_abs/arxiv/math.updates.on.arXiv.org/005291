In this paper we introduce a new metric homology theory, which we call Moderately Discontinuous
Homology. The basic idea involves the following basic ideas: first we define a singular homology
theory whose simplexes are families of singular chains depending on a parameter t in (0,1), so that
the distance from the support of the chain to the singularity approaches the singularity at speed
1 with respect to the parameter. Second, we allow b-moderately discontinuous chains for a certain
discontinuity rate b in ranging from 1 to infinity. Combining the homology group obtained for the
different discontinuity rates, we obtain an algebraic invariant that is given by a graded abelian
group for any b and homomorphisms between these groups. We prove finitely generation, for b equal
to infinity it recovers the homology of the punctured germ, and for b=1 it recovers the homology of
the tangent cone. Our homology theory is a bi-Lipschitz subanalitic invariant, is invariant by
suitable metric homotopies, and satisfies versions of the relative and Mayer-Vietoris long exact
sequences. Moreover, fixed a discontinuity rate b we show that it is functorial for a class of discontinuous
Lipschitz maps, whose discontinuities are b-moderated. We introduce an enhancement called Framed
MD Homology, which takes into account information from fundamental classes. As applications we
prove that Moderately Discontinuous Homology characterizes smooth germs among all complex analytic
germs, recovers the number of irreducible components of complex analytic germs and the embedded
topological type of plane branches. Framed MD Homology recovers the topological type of any plane
curve singularity and relative multiplicities of complex analytic germs.
