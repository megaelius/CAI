We consider $d$-dimensional random vectors $Y_1,\dots,Y_n$ that satisfy a mild general position
assumption a.s. The hyperplanes \begin{align*} (Y_i+Y_j)^\perp\;\; (1 \le i<j\le n),\quad (Y_i-Y_j)^\perp\;\;
(1\le i<j\le n),\quad Y_i^\perp\;\; (1\le i\le n) \end{align*} generate a conical tessellation
of the Euclidean $d$-space, which is closely related to the Weyl chambers of type $B_n$. We determine
the number of cones in this tessellation and show that it is a.s. constant. For a random cone chosen
uniformly at random from this random tessellation, we compute expectations for a general series
of geometric functionals. These include the face numbers, as well as the conical intrinsic volumes
and the conical quermassintegrals. Under the additional assumption of symmetric exchangeability
on $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$, the same is done for the dual random cones which have the same distribution
as the positive hull of $Y_1-Y_2,\ldots, Y_{n-1}-Y_n, Y_n$ given that this positive hull is not
equal to $\mathbb R^d$. All these expectations turn out to be distribution-free. Similarly, we
consider the conical tessellation induced by the hyperplanes \begin{align*} (Y_i-Y_j)^\perp\;\;
(1\le i<j\le n). \end{align*} This tessellation is closely related to the Weyl chambers of type
$A_{n-1}$. We compute the number of cones in this tessellation and the expectations of the same geometric
functionals for the random cones obtained from this random tessellation. The main ingredient in
the proofs is a connection between the number of faces of the tessellation and the number of faces
of the Weyl chambers of the corresponding type that are intersected by a certain linear subspace
in general position.
