Estimating causal interactions in complex networks is an important problem encountered in many
fields of current science. While a theoretical solution for detecting the graph of causal interactions
has been previously formulated in the framework of prediction improvement, it generally requires
the computation of high-dimensional information functionals -- a situation invoking the curse
of dimensionality with increasing network size. Recently, several methods have been proposed
to alleviate this problem, based on iterative procedures for assessment of conditional (in)dependences.
In the current work, we bring a comparison of several such prominent approaches. This is done both
by theoretical comparison of the algorithms using a formulation in a common framework, and by numerical
simulations including realistic complex coupling patterns. The theoretical analysis shows that
the algorithms are strongly related; including one algorithm being in particular situations equivalent
to the first phase of another. Moreover, numerical simulations suggest that the accuracy of most
of the algorithms is under suitable parameter choice almost indistinguishable. However, particularly
for large networks there are substantial differences in their computational demands, suggesting
some of the algorithms are relatively more efficient in the case of sparse networks, while other
perform better in the case of dense networks. The most recent variant of the algorithm by Runge et
al. then provides a promising speedup particularly for large sparse networks, albeit appears to
lead to a substantial decrease in accuracy in some scenarios. Based on the analysis of the reviewed
algorithms, we propose a hybrid approach that provides competitive results both concerning computational
efficiency and accuracy.
