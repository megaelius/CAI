Let $p\in \mathbb{N}$ be prime, and let $\theta$ be irrational. The authors have previously shown
that the noncommutative $p$-solenoid corresponding to the multiplier of the group $\left(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1}{p}\right]\right)^2$
parametrized by $\alpha=(\theta+1, (\theta+1)/p,\cdots, (\theta+1)/p^j,\cdots )$ is strongly
Morita equivalent to the noncommutative solenoid on $\left(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1}{p}\right]\right)^2$
coming from the multiplier $\beta= (1-\frac{\theta+1}{\theta},1-\frac{\theta+1}{p\theta},
\cdots, 1-\frac{\theta+1}{p^j\theta}, \cdots )$ . The method used a construction of Rieffel referred
to as the "Heisenberg bimodule" in which the two noncommutative solenoid corresponds to two different
twisted group algebras associated to dual lattices in $(\mathbb Q_p\times \mathbb R)^2.$ In this
paper, we make three additional observations: first, that at each stage, the subalgebra given by
the irrational rotation algebra corresponding to $\alpha_{2j}=(\theta+1)/p^{2j}$ is strongly
Morita equivalent to the irrational rotation algebra corresponding to the irrational rotation
algebra corresponding to $\beta_{2j}= 1-\frac{\theta+1}{p^{2j}\theta}$ by a different construction
of Rieffel, secondly, that that Rieffel's Heisenberg module relating the two non commutative solenoids
can be constructed as the closure of a nested sequence of function spaces associated to a multiresolution
analysis for a $p$-adic wavelet, and finally, at each stage, the equivalence bimodule between $A_{\alpha_{2j}}$
and $A_{\beta_{2j}}$ can be identified with the subequivalence bimodules arising from the $p$-adic
MRA. Aside from its instrinsic interest, we believe this construction will guide us in our efforts
to show that certain necessary conditions for two noncommutative solenoids to be strongly Morita
equivalent are also sufficient.
