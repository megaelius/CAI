For each $n$, let $A_n=(\sigma_{ij})$ be an $n\times n$ deterministic matrix and let $X_n=(X_{ij})$
be an $n\times n$ random matrix with i.i.d. centered entries of unit variance. In the companion article
Cook et al., we considered the empirical spectral distribution $\mu_n^Y$ of the rescaled entry-wise
product \[ Y_n = \frac 1{\sqrt{n}} A_n\odot X_n = \left(\frac1{\sqrt{n}} \sigma_{ij}X_{ij}\right)
\] and provided a deterministic sequence of probability measures $\mu_n$ such that the difference
$\mu^Y_n - \mu_n$ converges weakly in probability to the zero measure. A key feature in Cook et al.
was to allow some of the entries $\sigma_{ij}$ to vanish, provided that the standard deviation profiles
$A_n$ satisfy a certain quantitative irreducibility property. In the present article, we provide
more information on the sequence $(\mu_n)$, described by a family of Master Equations. We consider
these equations in important special cases such as separable variance profiles $\sigma^2_{ij}=d_i
\widetilde d_j$ and sampled variance profiles $\sigma^2_{ij} = \sigma^2\left(\frac in, \frac
jn \right)$ where $(x,y)\mapsto \sigma^2(x,y)$ is a given function on $[0,1]^2$. Associate examples
are provided where $\mu_n^Y$ converges to a genuine limit. We study $\mu_n$'s behavior at zero and
provide examples where $\mu_n$'s density is bounded, blows up, or vanishes while an atom appears.
As a consequence, we identify the profiles that yield the circular law. Finally, building upon recent
results from Alt et al., we prove that except maybe in zero, $\mu_n$ admits a positive density on the
centered disc of radius $\sqrt{\rho(V_n)}$, where $V_n=(\frac 1n \sigma_{ij}^2)$ and $\rho(V_n)$
is its spectral radius.
