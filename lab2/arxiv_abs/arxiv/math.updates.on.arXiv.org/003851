This paper describes a rigorous mathematical formulation providing a divergence free framework
for QCD and the standard model in curved space-time. The starting point of the theory is the notion
of covariance which is interpreted as (4D) conformal covariance rather than the general (diffeomorphism)
covariance of general relativity. It is shown how the infinitesimal symmetry group (i.e. Lie algebra)
of the theory, that is $su(2,2)$, is a linear direct sum of $su(3)$ and the algebra ${\mathfrak\kappa}\cong
sl(2,{\bf C})\times u(1)$, these being the QCD algebra and the electroweak algebra. Fock space
which is a graded algebra composed of Hilbert spaces of multiparticle states, where the particles
can be fermions such as quarks and electrons or bosons such as gluons and photons, is described concretely.
Algebra bundles whose typical fibers are the Fock spaces are defined. Scattering processes are
associated with covariant linear maps between the Fock space fibers which can be generated by intertwining
operators between the Fock spaces. It is shown how quark-quark scattering and gluon-gluon scattering
are associated with kernels which generate such intertwining operators. The rest of the paper focusses
on QCD vacuum polarization in order to compute and display the (1 loop) running coupling for QCD at
different scales. Through an easy application of the technique called the spectral calculus the
densities associated with the quark bubble and the gluon bubble are computed and hence the QCD vacuum
polarization function is determined. It is found that the QCD running coupling has non-trivial
behavior particularly at the subnuclear level. The plots of the QCD running coupling for quark separation
greater than $10^{-13}$ meters are found to be consistent with the properties of asymptotic freedom
in the high energy range and quark confinement in the low energy (large separation) range.
