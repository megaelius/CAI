The Douglas--Rachford method (DR) and its product space variant are often employed as iterated
maps for solving the \emph{feasibility problem} of the form: $\text{Find}\quad x \in \bigcap_{k=1}^N
S_k.$ The sets $S_k$ typically represent constraints that are easy to satisfy individually, but
more challenging when imposed together. When the constraints under consideration are modeled
by closed, convex, nonempty sets, convergence is well-understood. The method also demonstrates
surprising performance with nonconvex sets. Recently, the method of \emph{circumcentering reflections}
has been introduced, with the aim of accelerating convergence of averaged reflection methods like
DR in the convex setting of hypersurfaces. We introduce a generalization, GCR, that is amenable
to employment when the circumcentering reflections operator fails to be proper. In cases where
GCR locally reduces to CRM, we prove local convergence for certain plane curves together with lines,
the natural prototypical setting of most theoretical analysis of regular nonconvex DR. In particular,
we demonstrate local convergence to feasible points in cases where DR only converges to fixed points.
For those cases where DR is proven to converge to a \emph{feasible} point, we show that CRM locally
provides a better convergence rate. Finally, as a root finder, we show that CRM has local convergence
whenever Newton--Raphson does, exhibits quadratic convergence whenever Newton--Raphson does
so, and exhibits superlinear convergence in many cases where Newton--Raphson fails to converge
at all. Motivated by our theoretical results, we introduce a new 2 stage DR--GCR search algorithm,
and we apply it to wavelet construction recast as a feasibility problem, demonstrating its acceleration
over regular DR.
