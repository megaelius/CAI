In the first part of this two-part article, we have introduced and analyzed a multidimensional model,
called the 'rho-model', able to describe general quantum-like measurements with an arbitrary
number of outcomes, and we have used it as a general theoretical framework to study the most general
possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement, so defining what we have called a 'universal
measurement'. In this second part, we present the formal proof that universal measurements, which
are averages over all possible forms of fluctuations, produce the same probabilities as measurements
characterized by 'uniform' fluctuations on the measurement situation. Since quantum probabilities
can be shown to arise from the presence of such uniform fluctuations, we have proven that they can
be interpreted as the probabilities of a first-order non-classical theory, describing situations
in which the experimenter lacks complete knowledge about the nature of the interaction between
the measuring apparatus and the entity under investigation. This same explanation can be applied
-- mutatis mutandis -- to the case of cognitive measurements, made by human subjects on conceptual
entities, or in decision processes, although it is not necessarily the case that the structure of
the set of states would be in this case strictly Hilbertian. We also show that universal measurements
correspond to maximally 'robust' descriptions of indeterministic reproducible experiments,
and since quantum measurements can also be shown to be maximally robust, this adds plausibility
to their interpretation as universal measurements, and provides a further element of explanation
for the great success of the quantum statistics in the description of a large class of phenomena.
