We model continuous-time information flows generated by a number of information sources that switch
on and off at random times. By modulating a multi-dimensional information process over a random
point field, we explicitly relate the discovery of relevant new information sources to jumps in
conditional expectation processes of partially observed signals. We show that the underlying
measure-valued process follows jump-diffusion dynamics, where the jumps are governed by information
source switches. The dynamic representation gives rise to a set of martingales on random time intervals
that capture evolving information states as well as to a state-dependent stochastic volatility
evolution with jumps. The nature of information flows usually exhibits complex behaviour, however,
we succeed in maintaining analytic tractability by introducing what we term the effective and complementary
information processes. The effective information captures in a univariate process all information
provided by the active sources, and the complementary information is a function-valued stochastic
process which is constant between changes of states. One of the many potential applications is in
finance: we associate the signal to a random payoff and price a financial derivative within the modulated
information approach. It turns out that the price of a vanilla option can be expressed by a weighted
sum of option values based on the possible state configurations at option expiry. This result may
be viewed as an information-based analogue of Merton's option price, but where jump-diffusion
arises endogenously. The proposed information flow models also lend themselves to the quantification
of informational advantage among competitive agents who have asymmetric information flows.
