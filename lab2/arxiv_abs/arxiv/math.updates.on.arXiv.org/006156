We study the Bernstein-Landau paradox in the collisionless motion of an electrostatic plasma in
the presence of a constant external magnetic field. The Bernstein-Landau paradox consists in that
in the presence of the magnetic field, the electric field and the charge density fluctuation have
an oscillatory behavior in time. This is radically different from Landau damping, in the case without
magnetic field, where the electric field tends to zero for large times. We consider this problem
from a new point of view. Instead of analyzing the linear Vlasov-Poisson system, as it is usually
done, we study the linear Vlasov-Amp\`ere system. We formulate the Vlasov-Amp\`ere system as a
Schr\"odinger equation with a selfadjoint Vlasov-Amp\`ere operator in the Hilbert space of states
with finite energy. The Vlasov-Amp\`ere operator has a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions,
that include the Bernstein modes. The expansion of the solution of the Vlasov-Amp\`ere system in
the eigenfunctions shows the oscillatory behavior in time. We prove the convergence of the expansion
under optimal conditions, assuming only that the initial state has finite energy. This solves a
problem that was recently posed in the literature. The Bernstein modes are not complete. To have
a complete system it is necessary to add eigenfunctions that are associated with eigenvalues at
all the integer multiples of the cyclotron frequency. These special plasma oscillations actually
exist on their own, without the excitation of the other modes. In the limit when the magnetic fields
goes to zero the spectrum of the Vlasov-Amp\`ere operator changes drastically from pure point to
absolutely continuous in the orthogonal complement to its kernel , due to a sharp change on its domain.
This explains the Bernstein-Landau paradox. Furthermore, we present numerical simulations that
illustrate the Bernstein-Landau paradox.
