We present in this paper how the single-photon wave function for transversal photons (with the direct
sum of ordinary unitary representations of helicity 1 and -1 acting on it) is subsumed within the
formalism of Gupta-Bleuler for the quantized free electromagnetic field in the Krein space (i.e.
in the ordinary Hilbert space endowed with the Gupta-Bleuler operator $\eta$). Rigorous Gupta-Bleuler
quantization of the free electromagnetic field is based on a generalization of ours (published
formerly) of the Mackey theory of induced representations which includes representations preserving
the indefinite Krein inner-product given by the Gupta-Bleuler operator and acting in the Krein
space. The free electromagnetic field is constructed by application of the Segal's second quantization
functor to the specific Krein-isometric representation. A closed subspace $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$
of the single-photon Krein space on which the indefinite Krein-inner-product is strictly positive
is constructed such that the Krein-isometric single-photon representation generates modulo
unphysical states precisely the action of a representation which preserves the positive inner
product on $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$ induced by the Krein inner product, and is equal to the
direct sum of ordinary unitary representations of helicity 1 and -1 respectively. Two states of
single photon Krein space are physically equivalent whenever differ by a state of Krein norm zero
and whose projection on $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$, in the sense of the Krein-inner-product,
vanishes. In particulart it follows that the results of Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula on the single-photon
wave function may be reconciled with the micro-local perturbative approach to QED initiated by
St\"uckelberg and Bogoliubov.
