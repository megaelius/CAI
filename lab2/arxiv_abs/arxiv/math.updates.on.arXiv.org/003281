PBZ*-lattices are algebraic structures related to quantum logics, which consist of bounded lattices
endowed with two kinds of complements, named {\em Kleene} and {\em Brouwer}, such that the Kleene
complement satisfies a weakening of the orthomodularity condition and the De Morgan laws, while
the Brouwer complement only needs to satisfy the De Morgan laws for the pairs of elements with their
Kleene complements. PBZ*-lattices form a variety $\mathbb{PBZL}^{\ast }$, which includes the
variety $\mathbb{OML}$ of orthomodular lattices (considered with an extended signature, by letting
their two complements coincide) and the variety $V(\mathbb{AOL})$ generated by the class $\mathbb{AOL}$
of antiortholattices. We investigate the congruences of antiortholattices, in particular of
those obtained through certain ordinal sums, and infer characterizations for their subdirect
irreducibility. We also prove that antiortholattices are the directly irreducible members of
the variety they generate, and even their lattice reducts are directly irreducible. Since the two
complements act the same on the lattice bounds in all PBZ*-lattices, we can define the horizontal
sum of any nontrivial PBZ*-lattices, obtained by glueing them at their smallest and at their largest
elements; a horizontal sum of two nontrivial PBZ*-lattices is a PBZ*-lattice exactly when at least
one of its summands is an orthomodular lattice. We investigate the algebraic structures and the
congruence lattices of these horizontal sums, then the varieties they generate. We obtain a relative
axiomatization of the variety $V(\mathbb{OML}\boxplus \mathbb{AOL})$ generated by the horizontal
sums of nontrivial orthomodular lattices with nontrivial antiortholattices w.r.t. $\mathbb{PBZL}^{\ast
}$, as well as a relative axiomatization of the join of varieties $\mathbb{OML}\vee V(\mathbb{AOL})$
w.r.t. $V(\mathbb{OML}\boxplus \mathbb{AOL})$.
