Network data is prevalent in many contemporary big data applications in which a common interest
is to unveil important latent links between different pairs of nodes. Yet a simple fundamental question
of how to precisely quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the identification of
latent links still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose the method of statistical
inference on membership profiles in large networks (SIMPLE) in the setting of degree-corrected
mixed membership model, where the null hypothesis assumes that the pair of nodes share the same profile
of community memberships. In the simpler case of no degree heterogeneity, the model reduces to the
mixed membership model for which an alternative more robust test is also proposed. Both tests are
of the Hotelling-type statistics based on the rows of empirical eigenvectors or their ratios, whose
asymptotic covariance matrices are very challenging to derive and estimate. Nevertheless, their
analytical expressions are unveiled and the unknown covariance matrices are consistently estimated.
Under some mild regularity conditions, we establish the exact limiting distributions of the two
forms of SIMPLE test statistics under the null hypothesis and contiguous alternative hypothesis.
They are the chi-square distributions and the noncentral chi-square distributions, respectively,
with degrees of freedom depending on whether the degrees are corrected or not. We also address the
important issue of estimating the unknown number of communities and establish the asymptotic properties
of the associated test statistics. The advantages and practical utility of our new procedures in
terms of both size and power are demonstrated through several simulation examples and real network
applications.
