Here we study theoretically and compare experimentally an efficient method for solving systems
of algebraic equations, where the matrix comes from the discretization of a fractional diffusion
operator. More specifically, we focus on matrices obtained from finite difference or finite element
approximation of second order elliptic problems in $\mathbb R^d$, $d=1,2,3$. The proposed methods
are based on the best uniform rational approximation (BURA) $r_{\alpha,k}(t)$ of $t^{\alpha}$
on $[0,1]$. Here $r_{\alpha,k}$ is a rational function of $t$ involving numerator and denominator
polynomials of degree at most $k$. We show that the proposed method is exponentially convergent
with respect to $k$ and has some attractive properties. First, it reduces the solution of the nonlocal
system to solution of $k$ systems with matrix $(A +c_j I)$ and $c_j>0$, $j=1,2,\ldots,k$. Thus,
good computational complexity can be achieved if fast solvers are available for such systems. Second,
the original problem and its rational approximation in the finite difference case are positivity
preserving. In the finite element case, positivity preserving results when mass lumping is employed
under some mild conditions on the mesh. Further, we prove that in the mass lumping case, the scheme
still leads to the expected rate of convergence, at times assuming additional regularity on the
right hand side. Finally, we present comprehensive numerical experiments on a number of model problems
for various $\alpha$ in one and two spatial dimensions. These illustrate the computational behavior
of the proposed method and compare its accuracy and efficiency with that of other methods developed
by Harizanov et. al. and Bonito and Pasciak.
