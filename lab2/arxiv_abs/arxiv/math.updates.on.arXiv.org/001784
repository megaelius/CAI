We investigate a probabilistic model for routeing in a multihop ad-hoc communication network,
where each user sends a message to the base station. Messages travel in hops via the other users, used
as relays. Their trajectories are chosen at random according to a Gibbs distribution that favours
trajectories with low interference, measured in terms of sum of the signal-to-interference ratios
for all the hops, and collections of trajectories with little total congestion, measured in terms
of the number of pairs of hops arriving at each relay. This model was introduced in our earlier paper
\cite{KT17}, where we expressed, in the high-density limit, the distribution of the optimal trajectories
as the minimizer of a characteristic variational formula. In the present work, in the special case
in which congestion is not penalized, we derive qualitative properties of this minimizer. We encounter
and quantify emerging typical pictures in analytic terms in three extreme regimes. We analyze the
typical number of hops and the typical length of a hop, and the deviation of the trajectory from the
straight line in two regimes, (1) in the limit of a large communication area and large distances,
and (2) in the limit of a strong interference weight. In both regimes, the typical trajectory turns
out to quickly approach a straight line, in regime (1) with equally-sized hops. Surprisingly, in
regime (1), the typical length of a hop diverges logarithmically as the distance of the transmitter
to the base station diverges. We further analyze the local and global repulsive effect of (3) a densely
populated area on the trajectories. Our findings are illustrated by numerical examples. We also
discuss a game-theoretic relation of our Gibbsian model with a joint optimization of message trajectories
opposite to a selfish optimization, in case congestion is also penalized.
