We study numerically the geometrical and free-energy fluctuations of a static one-dimensional
(1D) interface with a short-range elasticity, submitted to a quenched random-bond Gaussian disorder
of finite correlation length $\xi>0$, and at finite temperature $T$. Using the exact mapping
from the static 1D interface to the 1+1 Directed Polymer (DP) growing in a continuous space, we focus
our analysis on the disorder free-energy of the DP endpoint, a quantity which is strictly zero in
absence of disorder and whose sample-to-sample fluctuations at a fixed growing `time' $t$ inherit
the statistical translation-invariance of the microscopic disorder explored by the DP. Constructing
a new numerical scheme for the integration of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) evolution equation
obeyed by the free-energy, we address numerically the `time'- and temperature-dependence of the
disorder free-energy fluctuations at fixed finite $\xi$. We examine on one hand the amplitude $\tilde{D}_{t}$
and effective correlation length $\tilde{\xi}_t$ of the free-energy fluctuations, and on the
other hand the imprint of the specific microscopic disorder correlator on the large-`time' shape
of the free-energy two-point correlator. We observe numerically the crossover to a low-temperature
regime below a finite characteristic temperature $T_c(\xi)$, as previously predicted by Gaussian-Variational-Method
(GVM) computations and scaling arguments, and extensively investigated analytically in [Phys.
Rev. E, 87 042406 (2013)]. Finally we address numerically the `time'- and temperature-dependence
of the roughness $B(t)$, which quantifies the DP endpoint transverse fluctuations, and we show
how the amplitude $\tilde{D}_{\infty}(T,\xi)$ controls the different regimes experienced by
$B(t)$ -- in agreement with the analytical predictions of a DP `toymodel' approach.
