We consider a new class of potentially exotic group C*-algebras $C^*_{PF_p^*}(G)$ for a locally
compact group $G$, and its connection with the class of potentially exotic group C*-algebras $C^*_{L^p}(G)$
introduced by Brown and Guentner. Surprisingly, these two classes of C*-algebras are intimately
related. By exploiting this connection, we show $C^*_{L^p}(G)=C^*_{PF_p^*}(G)$ for $p\in (2,\infty)$,
and the C*-algebras $C^*_{L^p}(G)$ are pairwise distinct for $p\in (2,\infty)$ when $G$ belongs
to a large class of nonamenable groups possessing the Haagerup property and either the rapid decay
property or Kunze-Stein phenomenon by characterizing the positive definite functions that extend
to positive linear functionals of $C^*_{L^p}(G)$ and $C^*_{PF_p^*}(G)$. This greatly generalizes
earlier results of Okayasu and the second author on the pairwise distinctness of $C^*_{L^p}(G)$
for $2<p<\infty$ when $G$ is either a noncommutative free group or the group $SL(2,\mathbb R)$,
respectively. As a byproduct of our techniques, we present two applications to the theory of unitary
representations of a locally compact group $G$. Firstly, we give a short proof of the well-known
Cowling-Haagerup-Howe Theorem which presents sufficient condition implying the weak containment
of a cyclic unitary representation of $G$ in the left regular representation of $G$. Also we give
a near solution to a 1978 conjecture of Cowling. This conjecture of Cowling states if $G$ is a Kunze-Stein
group and $\pi$ is a unitary representation of $G$ with cyclic vector $\xi$ such that the map $$G\ni
s\mapsto \langle \pi(s)\xi,\xi\rangle$$ belongs to $L^p(G)$ for some $2< p <\infty$, then $A_\pi\subseteq
L^p(G)$. We show $B_\pi\subseteq L^{p+\epsilon}(G)$ for every $\epsilon>0$ (recall $A_\pi\subseteq
B_\pi$).
