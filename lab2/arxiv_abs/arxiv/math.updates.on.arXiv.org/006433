We deal with the following general version of the classical moment problem: when can a linear functional
on a unital commutative real algebra $A$ be represented as an integral with respect to a Radon measure
on the character space $X(A)$ of $A$ equipped with the Borel $\sigma-$algebra generated by the weak
topology $\tau_{X(A)}$? We approach this problem by constructing $X(A)$ as a projective limit
of the character spaces of all finitely generated unital subalgebras of $A$ and so by considering
on $X(A)$ two natural measurable structures: the associated cylinder $\sigma-$algebra and the
Borel $\sigma-$algebra generated by the corresponding projective topology which coincides with
the weak topology $\tau_{X(A)}$. Using some fundamental results for measures on projective limits
of measurable spaces, we determine a criterion for the existence of an integral representation
of a linear functional on $A$ with respect to a measure on the cylinder $\sigma-$algebra on $X(A)$
(resp. a Radon measure on the Borel $\sigma-$algebra on $X(A)$) provided that for any finitely generated
unital subalgebra of $A$ the corresponding moment problem is solvable. We also investigate how
to localize the support of representing measures for linear functionals on $A$. These results allow
us to establish infinite dimensional analogues of the classical Riesz-Haviland and Nussbaum theorems
as well as a representation theorem for linear functionals non-negative on a "partially Archimedean"
quadratic module of $A$. Our results in particular apply to the case when $A$ is the algebra of polynomials
in infinitely many variables or the symmetric tensor algebra of a real infinite dimensional vector
space, providing alternative proofs (and in some cases stronger versions) of some recent results
for these instances of the moment problem and offering at the same time a unified setting which enables
comparisons.
