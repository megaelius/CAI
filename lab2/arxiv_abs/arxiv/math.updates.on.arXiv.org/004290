We propose a numerical pipeline for shape optimization in naval engineering involving two different
non-intrusive reduced order method (ROM) techniques. Such methods are proper orthogonal decomposition
with interpolation (PODI) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The ROM proposed will be enhanced
by active subspaces (AS) as a pre-processing tool that reduce the parameter space dimension and
suggest better sampling of the input space. We will focus on geometrical parameters describing
the perturbation of a reference bulbous bow through the free form deformation (FFD) technique.
The ROM are based on a finite volume method (FV) to simulate the multi-phase incompressible flow
around the deformed hulls. In previous works we studied the reduction of the parameter space in naval
engineering through AS [38, 10] focusing on different parts of the hull. PODI and DMD have been employed
for the study of fast and reliable shape optimization cycles on a bulbous bow in [9]. The novelty of
this work is the simultaneous reduction of both the input parameter space and the output fields of
interest. In particular AS will be trained computing the total drag resistance of a hull advancing
in calm water and its gradients with respect to the input parameters. DMD will improve the performance
of each simulation of the campaign using only few snapshots of the solution fields in order to predict
the regime state of the system. Finally PODI will interpolate the coefficients of the POD decomposition
of the output fields for a fast approximation of all the fields at new untried parameters given by
the optimization algorithm. This will result in a non-intrusive data-driven numerical optimization
pipeline completely independent with respect to the full order solver used and it can be easily incorporated
into existing numerical pipelines, from the reference CAD to the optimal shape.
