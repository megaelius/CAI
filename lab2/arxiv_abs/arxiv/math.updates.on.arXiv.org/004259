Ergodicity of random dynamical systems where a periodic measure exists on a Polish space is obtained.
In the Markovian random dynamical systems case, the idea of Poincar\'e sections is introduced.
It is proved that if the periodic measure is PS-ergodic, then it is ergodic. Moreover, if the infinitesimal
generator of the Markov semigroup has only equally placed simple eigenvalues including $0$ on the
imaginary axis, then the periodic measure is PS-ergodic. Conversely if the periodic measure is
PS-mixing, then the infinitesimal generator has only equally placed simple eigenvalues including
$0$ on the imaginary axis. This is clearly distinguished from the mixing stationary case in which
the Koopman-von Neumann Theorem says there is only one simple eigenvalue $0$ on the imaginary axis.
This result is also proved for stochastic semi-flow case. Random periodic paths of the stochastic
perturbation of the periodic motion of an ODE is obtained. The "equivalence" of random periodic
processes and periodic measures is established. It is proved that a random periodic path of a random
dynamical system gives a periodic measure. Conversely, in general a periodic measure may not give
a random periodic path on the original probability space. But on an enlarged probability space,
the extended random dynamical system has a random periodic process. The law of the random periodic
process is the periodic measure in the Markovian case. The strong law of large numbers (SLLN) is also
proved. This is a new class of random processes satisfying the ergodic theory and SLLN complimentary
to the existing results in the stationary regime.
