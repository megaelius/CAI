In this article we study two classical linear water wave problems, i) normal modes of infinite straight
channels of bounded constant cross-section, and ii) trapped longitudinal modes in domains with
unbounded constant cross-section. Both problems can be stated using linearized free surface potential
flow theory, and our goal is to compare known analytic solutions in the literature to numerical solutions
obtained using an ad-hoc but simple approximation of the non-local Dirichlet-Neumann operator
for linear waves proposed in [vargas2016whitham]. To study normal modes in channels with bounded
cross-section we consider special symmetric triangular cross-sections, namely symmetric triangles
with sides inclined at $45^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$ to the vertical, and compare modes obtained
using the non-local Dirichlet-Neumann operator to known semi-exact analytic expressions by Lamb
[lamb1932hydrodynamics], Macdonald [macdonald1893waves] , Greenhill [greenhill1887wave],
Packham [packham1980small], and Groves [groves1994hamiltonian]. These geometries have slopping
beach boundaries that should in principle limit the applicability of our approximate Dirichlet-Neumann
operator. We nevertheless see that the operator gives remarkably close results for even modes,
while for odd modes we have some discrepancies near the boundary. For trapped longitudinal modes
in domains with an infinite cross-section we consider a piecewise constant depth profile and compare
modes computed with the nonlocal operator modes to known analytic solutions of linearized shallow
water theory by Miles [miles1972wave], Lin, Juang and Tsay [lin2001anomalous], see also [mei2005theory].
This is a problem of significant geophysical interest, and the proposed model is shows to give quantitatively
similar results for the lowest trapped modes.
