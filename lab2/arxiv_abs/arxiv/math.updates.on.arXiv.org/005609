There exist several endeavors proposing a new family of extended distributions using the beta-generating
technique. This is a well-known mechanism in developing flexible distributions, by embedding
the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a baseline distribution within the beta distribution
that acts as a generator. Univariate beta-generated distributions offer many fruitful and tractable
properties and have applications in hydrology, biology and environmental sciences amongst other
fields. In the univariate cases, this extension works well, however, for multivariate cases, the
beta distribution generator delivers complex expressions. In this document, the proposed extension
from the univariate to the multivariate domain addresses the need of flexible multivariate distributions
that can model a wide range of multivariate data. This new family of multivariate distributions,
whose marginals are beta-generated distributed, is constructed with the function H(x_{1},...,x_{p})=F(G_{1}(x_{1}),G_{2}(x_{2}),...,G_{p}(x_{p})),
where $G_{i}(x_{i})$ are the cdfs of the gamma (baseline) distribution and F(.) as the cdf of the
Dirichlet distribution. Hence as the main example, a general model having the support [0,1]^{p}
(for p variates), using the Dirichlet as the generator, is developed together with some distributional
properties, such as the moment generating function. The proposed Dirichlet-generated distributions
can be applied to compositional data. The parameters of the model are estimated by using the maximum
likelihood method. The effectiveness and prominence of the proposed family are illustrated by
analyzing simulated as well as two real datasets. A new model testing technique is introduced to
evaluate the performance of the multivariate models.
