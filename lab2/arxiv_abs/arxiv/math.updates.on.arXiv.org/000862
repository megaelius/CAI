We discuss a unified approach to a class of geometric combinatorics incidence problems in two dimensions,
of the Erd\"os distance type. The goal is obtaining the second moment estimate. That is, given a finite
point set $S$ in $2D$, and a function $f$ on $S\times S$, find the upper bound for the number of solutions
of the equation $$ (*)\qquad f(p,p') = f(q,q')\neq 0,\qquad (p,p',q,q')\in S\times S\times S\times
S. $$ E.g., $f\;$ is the Euclidean distance in the plane, sphere, or hyperboloid. Our ultimate tool
is the Guth-Katz incidence theorem for lines in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ but we focus on how the original
problem in $2D$ gets reduced to its application. The corresponding procedure was initiated by Elekes
and Sharir, based on symmetry considerations. The point we make is that symmetry considerations,
not necessarily straightforward and potentially requiring group representation machinery,
can be bypassed or made implicit. The Pl\"ucker-Klein formalism for line geometry enables one to
directly interpret a solution of ($*$) as intersection of two lines in $\mathbb{RP}^3$. This allows
for a very brief argument extending the Euclidean plane distance bound to the spherical and hyperbolic
distances. The space of lines in $\mathbb{RP}^3$, the Klein quadric $\mathcal K$, is four-dimensional.
We start out with an injective map $\mathfrak F: \,S\times S\to \mathcal K\;\;$ from a pair of points
$(p,q)$ to a line $l_{pq}$, and seek a corresponding combinatorial problem in the form ($*$) in $2D$,
which can be solved by applying the Guth-Katz theorem to the set of lines $\{l_{pq}\}$ in $\mathbb{RP}^3$.
We identify a few such problems, and make generalisations of the existing ones. It is the direct approach
that is the main purpose of this paper.
