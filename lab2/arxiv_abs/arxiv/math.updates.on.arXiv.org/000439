A permutation is square-free if it does not contain two consecutive factors of length two or more
that are order-isomorphic. A permutation is bicrucial with respect to squares if it is square-free
but any extension of it to the right or to the left by any element gives a permutation that is not square-free.
Bicrucial permutations with respect to squares were studied by Avgustinovich et al., who proved
that there exist bicrucial permutations of lengths $8k+1, 8k+5, 8k+7$ for $k\ge 1$. It was left as
open questions whether bicrucial permutations of even length, or such permutations of length $8k+3$
exist. In this paper, we provide an encoding of orderings which allows us, using the constraint solver
Minion, to show that bicrucial permutations of even length exist, and the smallest such permutations
are of length 32. To show that 32 is the minimum length in question, we establish a result on left-crucial
(that is, not extendable to the left) square-free permutations which begin with three elements
in monotone order. Also, we show that bicrucial permutations of length $8k+3$ exist for $k=2,3$
and they do not exist for $k=1$. Further, we generalise the notions of right-crucial, left-crucial,
and bicrucial permutations studied in the literature in various contexts, by introducing the notion
of $P$-crucial permutations that can be extended to the notion of $P$-crucial words. In S-crucial
permutations, a particular case of $P$-crucial permutations, we deal with permutations that avoid
prohibitions, but whose extensions in any position contain a prohibition. We show that S-crucial
permutations exist with respect to squares, and minimal such permutations are of length 17. Finally,
using our software, we generate much of relevant data showing, for example, that there are 162,190,472
bicrucial square-free permutations of length 19.
