In this work, we revisit the scaling analysis and commonly accepted conditions for the validity
of the standard, reverse and total quasi-steady-state approximations through the lens of dimensional
Tikhonov-Fenichel parameters and their respective critical manifolds. By combining Tikhonov-Fenichel
parameters with scaling analysis and energy methods, we derive improved upper bounds on the approximation
error for the standard, reverse and total quasi-steady-state approximations. Furthermore, previous
analyses suggest that the reverse quasi-steady-state approximation is only valid when initial
enzyme concentrations greatly exceed initial substrate concentrations. However, our results
indicate that this approximation can be valid when initial enzyme and substrate concentrations
are of equal magnitude. Using energy methods, we find that the condition for the validity of the reverse
quasi-steady-state approximation is far less restrictive than was previously assumed, and we
derive a new "small" parameter that determines the validity of this approximation. In doing so,
we extend the established domain of validity for the reverse quasi-steady-state approximation.
Consequently, this opens up the possibility of utilizing the reverse quasi-steady-state approximation
to model enzyme catalyzed reactions and estimate kinetic parameters in enzymatic assays at much
lower enzyme to substrate ratios than was previously thought. Moreover, we show for the first time
that the critical manifold of the reverse quasi-steady-state approximation contains a singular
point where normal hyperbolicity is lost. Associated with this singularity is a transcritical
bifurcation, and the corresponding normal form of this bifurcation is recovered through scaling
analysis.
