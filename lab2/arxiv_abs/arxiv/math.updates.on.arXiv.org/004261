Shock wave solutions of the Einstein equations are constructed in coordinates systems in which
the gravitational metric is only Lipschitz continuous, but the connection $\Gamma$ and curvature
$Riem(\Gamma)$ are both in $L^{\infty}$, the curvature being one derivative smoother than the
curvature of a general Lipschitz metric. At this low level of regularity, the physical meaning of
such gravitational metrics remains problematic. Here we address the mathematical problem as to
whether the condition that $Riem(\Gamma)$ has the same regularity as $\Gamma$, or equivalently
the exterior derivatives $d\Gamma$ have the same regularity as $\Gamma$, is sufficient to allow
for the existence of a coordinate transformation which perfectly cancels out the jumps in the leading
order derivatives of $\delta\Gamma$, thereby raising the regularity of the connection and the
metric by one order--a subtle problem. We have now discovered, in a framework much more general than
GR shock waves, that the regularization of non-optimal connections is determined by a nonlinear
system of elliptic equations with matrix valued differential forms as unknowns, the Regularity
Transformation equations, or RT-equations. In this paper we establish the first existence theory
for the nonlinear RT-equations in the general case when $\Gamma, {\rm Riem}(\Gamma)\in W^{m,p}$,
$m\geq1$, $p>n$. From this we conclude that for any connection $\Gamma(x) \in W^{m,p}$ with ${\rm
Riem}(\Gamma) \in W^{m,p}$, $m\geq1$, $p>n$, given in $x$-coordinates, there always exists a
coordinate transformation $x\to y$ such that $\Gamma(y) \in W^{m+1,p}$, that is $\Gamma$ exhibits
optimal regularity in $y$-coordinates. The problem of optimal regularity for the hyperbolic Einstein
equations is thus resolved by elliptic regularity theory in $L^p$-spaces applied to the RT-equations.
