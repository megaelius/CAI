We prove a generalisation of the correspondence, due to Resende and Lawson--Lenz, between \'etale
groupoids---which are topological groupoids whose source map is a local homeomorphisms---and
complete pseudogroups---which are inverse monoids equipped with a particularly nice representation
on a topological space. Our generalisation improves on the existing functorial correspondence
in four ways. Firstly, we enlarge the classes of maps appearing to each side. Secondly, we generalise
on one side from inverse monoids to inverse categories, and on the other side, from \'etale groupoids
to what we call partite \'etale groupoids. Thirdly, we generalise from \'etale groupoids to source-\'etale
categories, and on the other side, from inverse monoids to restriction monoids. Fourthly, and most
far-reachingly, we generalise from topological \'etale groupoids to \'etale groupoids internal
to any join restriction category C with local glueings; and on the other side, from complete pseudogroups
to ``complete C-pseudogroups'', i.e., inverse monoids with a nice representation on an object
of C. Taken together, our results yield an equivalence, for a join restriction category C with local
glueings, between join restriction categories with a well-behaved functor to C, and partite source-\'etale
internal categories in C. In fact, we obtain this by cutting down a larger adjunction between arbitrary
restriction categories over C, and partite internal categories in C. Beyond proving this main result,
numerous applications are given, which reconstruct and extend existing correspondences in the
literature, and provide general formulations of completion processes.
