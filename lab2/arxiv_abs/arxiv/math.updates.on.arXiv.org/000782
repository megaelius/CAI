Often when we deal with `Big Data', the true effects we are interested in are Rare and Weak (RW). Researchers
measure a large number of features, hoping to find perhaps only a small fraction of them to be relevant
to the research in question; the effect sizes of the relevant features are individually small so
the true effects are not strong enough to stand out for themselves. Higher Criticism (HC) and Graphlet
Screening (GS) are two classes of methods that are specifically designed for the Rare/Weak settings.
HC was introduced to determine whether there are any relevant effects in all the measured features.
More recently, HC was applied to classification, where it provides a method for selecting useful
predictive features for trained classification rules. GS was introduced as a graph-guided multivariate
screening procedure, and was used for variable selection. We develop a theoretic framework where
we use an Asymptotic Rare and Weak (ARW) model simultaneously controlling the size and prevalence
of useful/significant features among the useless/null bulk. At the heart of the ARW model is the
so-called phase diagram, which is a way to visualize clearly the class of ARW settings where the relevant
effects are so rare or weak that desired goals (signal detection, variable selection, etc.) are
simply impossible to achieve. We show that HC and GS have important advantages over better known
procedures and achieve the optimal phase diagrams in a variety of ARW settings. HC and GS are flexible
ideas that adapt easily to many interesting situations. We review the basics of these ideas and some
of the recent extensions, discuss their connections to existing literature, and suggest some new
applications of these ideas.
