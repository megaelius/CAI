Recently, based on the idea of randomizing space theory, random convex analysis has been being developed
in order to deal with the corresponding problems in random environments such as analysis of conditional
convex risk measures and the related variational problems and optimization problems. Random convex
analysis is convex analysis over random locally convex modules. Since random locally convex modules
have the more complicated topological and algebraic structures than ordinary locally convex spaces,
establishing random convex analysis will encounter harder mathematical challenges than classical
convex analysis so that there are still a lot of fundamentally important unsolved problems in random
convex analysis. This paper is devoted to solving some important theoretic problems. First, we
establish the inferior limit behavior of a proper lower semicontinuous $L^0$--convex function
on a random locally convex module endowed with the locally $L^0$--convex topology, which makes
perfect the Fenchel--Moreau duality theorem for such functions. Then, we investigate the relations
among continuity, locally $L^0$--Lipschitzian continuity and almost surely sequent continuity
of a proper $L^0$--convex function. And then, we establish the elegant relationships among subdifferentiability,
G\^ateaux--differentiability and Fr\'ech\'et--differentiability for a proper $L^0$--convex
function defined on random normed modules. At last, based on the Ekeland's variational principle
for a proper lower semicontinuous $\bar{L}^0$--valued function, we show that $\varepsilon$--subdifferentials
can be approximated by subdifferentials. We would like to emphasize that the success of this paper
lies in simultaneously considering the $(\varepsilon, \lambda)$--topology and the locally $L^0$--convex
topology for a random locally convex module.
