Symbolic Extension Entropy Theorem (SEET) describes the possibility of a lossless digitalization
of a dynamical system by extending it to a subshift. It gives an estimate on the entropy of symbolic
extensions (and the necessary number of symbols). Unlike in the measure-theoretic case, where
Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy is the estimate, in the topological setup the task reaches beyond the
classical theory of entropy. Tools from an extended theory of entropy structures are needed. The
main goal of this paper is to prove the SEET for actions of countable amenable groups: Let a countable
amenable group $G$ act by homeomorphisms on a compact metric space $X$ and let $\mathcal M_G(X)$
denote the simplex of $G$-invariant probability measures on $X$. A function $E $ on $\mathcal M_G(X)$
equals the extension entropy function $h^\pi$ of a symbolic extension $\pi:(Y,G)\to (X,G)$, where
$h^\pi(\mu)=\sup\{h_\nu(Y,G): \nu\in\pi^{-1}(\mu)\}$ ($\mu\in\mathcal M_G(X)$), if and
only if $E $ is an affine superenvelope of the entropy structure of $(X,G)$. The statement is preceded
by presentation of the concepts of an entropy structure and superenvelopes, adapted from $\mathbb
Z$-actions. In full generality we prove a slightly weaker version of SEET, in which symbolic extensions
are replaced by quasi-symbolic extensions, i.e., extensions in form of a joining of a subshift with
a zero-entropy tiling system. The notion of a tiling system is a subject of earlier works and in this
paper we review and complement the theory developed there. The full version of the SEET is proved
for groups which are either residually finite or enjoy the comparison property. In order to describe
the range of our theorem, we devote a large portion of the paper to the comparison property. Our main
result in this aspect shows that all subexponential groups have the comparison property (and thus
satisfy the SEET).
