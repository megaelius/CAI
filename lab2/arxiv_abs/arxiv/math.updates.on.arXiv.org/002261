The problem of model selection in the context of a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
has not been touched upon in the literature. Indeed, properties of Bayes factors have not been studied
even in single SDE based model comparison problems. In this article, we first develop an asymptotic
theory of Bayes factors when two SDEs are compared, assuming the time domain expands. Using this
we then develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when systems of SDEs are compared, assuming
that the number of equations in each system, as well as the time domain, increase indefinitely. Our
asymptotic theory covers situations when the observed processes associated with the SDEs are independently
and identically distributed (iid), as well as when they are independently but not identically distributed
(non-iid). Quite importantly, we allow inclusion of available time-dependent covariate information
into each SDE through a multiplicative factor of the drift function in a random effects set-up; different
initial values for the SDEs are also permitted. Thus, our general model-selection framework includes
simultaneously the variable selection problem associated with time-varying covariates, as well
as choice of the part of the drift function free of covariates. As we show, the Bayes factor is inconsistent
for comparing individual SDEs, in the sense that the log-Bayes factor converges only in expectation,
while the relevant variance does not converge to zero. Nevertheless, it has been possible to exploit
this result to establish almost sure exponential convergence of the Bayes factor when, in addition,
the number of individuals are also allowed to increase indefinitely. We carry out simulated and
real data analyses to demonstrate that Bayes factor is a suitable candidate for covariate selection
in our SDE models even in non-asymptotic situations.
