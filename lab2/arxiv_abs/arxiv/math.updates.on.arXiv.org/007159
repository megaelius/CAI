This work improves the concept of conventional NMR theory, in which the positions of the nuclei are
limited to fixed points, to the case in which the nuclei can be continuously distributed in space.
Experimental NMR data contain highly detailed information about molecular structures which can
be reconstructed only relatively roughly with today's NMR theories. This is because the effective
spin model idealizes nuclei as fixed point particles, while bond rotations, vibrations and proton
exchange cause delocalization of nuclei. In current NMR theory, the omnipresent delocalization
of nuclei is either described phenomenologically in the form of rate constants or neglected completely.
This prevents an investigation and reconstruction of the more realistic, continuous probability
density for the spatial distribution of the nuclei. Hence, a lot information on spatial distributions
of nuclei remain hidden in experimental NMR data. In this document it is shown how the continuous
probability density for the spatial distribution of the nuclei can be investigated and reconstructed
from NMR data. To this end, it is shown how NMR spectra can be calculated directly from molecular Quantum
Electrodynamics at finite temperatures. The fundamental problem of performing numerical calculations
with the infinite-dimensional radiation field is solved by using the algebraic reformulation
of Quantum Field Theory. Furthermore, it is shown that the presented method corrects wrong predictions
of the effective spin model. It is outlined that the presented method can be applied to any molecular
system whose electronic ground state can be calculated using a common quantum chemical method.
Therefore, the presented method may be used to obtain a more detailed molecular structure from NMR
data and hence replace the effective spin model which forms the basis for NMR theory since about seven
decades.
