In a lossless compression system with target lengths, a compressor ${\cal C}$ maps an integer $m$
and a binary string $x$ to an $m$-bit code $p$, and if $m$ is sufficiently large, a decompressor ${\cal
D}$ reconstructs $x$ from $p$. We call a pair $(m,x)$ $\textit{achievable}$ for $({\cal C},{\cal
D})$ if this reconstruction is successful. We introduce the notion of an optimal compressor ${\cal
C}_\text{opt}$, by the following universality property: For any compressor-decompressor pair
$({\cal C}, {\cal D})$, there exists a decompressor ${\cal D}'$ such that if $(m,x)$ is achievable
for $({\cal C},{\cal D})$, then $(m+\Delta, x)$ is achievable for $({\cal C}_\text{opt}, {\cal
D}')$, where $\Delta$ is some small value called the overhead. We show that there exists an optimal
compressor that has only polylogarithmic overhead and works in probabilistic polynomial time.
Differently said, for any pair $({\cal C}, {\cal D})$, no matter how slow ${\cal C}$ is, or even if
${\cal C}$ is non-computable, ${\cal C}_{\text{opt}}$ is a fixed compressor that in polynomial
time produces codes almost as short as those of ${\cal C}$. The cost is that the corresponding decompressor
is slower. We also show that each such optimal compressor can be used for distributed compression,
in which case it can achieve optimal compression rates, as given in the Slepian-Wolf theorem, and
even for the Kolmogorov complexity variant of this theorem. Moreover, the overhead is logarithmic
in the number of sources, and unlike previous implementations of Slepian-Wolf coding, meaningful
compression can still be achieved if the number of sources is much larger than the length of the compressed
strings.
