One of the most widely studied convex relaxations in combinatorial optimization is the relaxation
of the cut polytope $\mathscr C^N$ to the elliptope $\mathscr E^N$, which corresponds to the degree
2 sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxation of optimizing a quadratic form over the hypercube $\{\pm 1\}^N$.
We study the extension of this classical idea to degree 4 SOS, which gives an intermediate relaxation
we call the degree 4 generalized elliptope $\mathscr E_4^N$. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient
condition for the Gram matrix of a collection of vectors to belong to $\mathscr E_4^N$. Consequences
include a tight rank inequality between degree 2 and degree 4 pseudomoment matrices, and a guarantee
that the only extreme points of $\mathscr E^N$ also in $\mathscr E_4^N$ are the cut matrices; that
is, $\mathscr E^N$ and $\mathscr E_4^N$ share no "spurious" extreme point. For Gram matrices of
equiangular tight frames, we give a simple criterion for membership in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$. This
yields new inequalities satisfied in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$ but not $\mathscr{E}^N$ whose structure
is related to the Schl\"{a}fli graph and which cannot be obtained as linear combinations of triangle
inequalities. We also give a new proof of the restriction to degree 4 of a result of Laurent showing
that $\mathscr{E}_4^N$ does not satisfy certain cut polytope inequalities capturing parity constraints.
Though limited to this special case, our proof of the positive semidefiniteness of Laurent's pseudomoment
matrix is short and elementary. Our techniques also suggest that membership in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$
is closely related to the partial transpose operation on block matrices, which has previously played
an important role in the study of quantum entanglement. To illustrate, we present a correspondence
between certain entangled bipartite quantum states and the matrices of $\mathscr{E}_4^N\setminus\mathscr{C}^N$.
