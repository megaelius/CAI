An extended formulation of a polyhedron $P$ is a linear description of a polyhedron $Q$ together
with a linear map $\pi$ such that $\pi(Q)=P$. These objects are of fundamental importance in polyhedral
combinatorics and optimization theory, and the subject of a number of studies. Yannakakis' factorization
theorem [M. Yannakakis. Expressing combinatorial optimization problems by linear programs.
{\em J. Comput. System Sci.}, 43(3):441--466 (1991)] provides a surprising connection between
extended formulations and communication complexity, showing that the smallest size of an extended
formulation of $P$ equals the nonnegative rank of its slack matrix $S$. Moreover, Yannakakis also
shows that the nonnegative rank of $S$ is at most $2^c$, where $c$ is the complexity of any \emph{deterministic}
protocol computing $S$. In this paper, we show that the latter result can be strengthened when we
allow protocols to be \emph{randomized}. In particular, we prove that the base-2 logarithm of the
nonnegative rank of any nonnegative matrix equals the minimum complexity of a randomized communication
protocol computing the matrix in expectation. Using Yannakakis' factorization theorem, this
implies that the base-2 logarithm of the smallest size of an extended formulation of a polytope $P$
equals the minimum complexity of a randomized communication protocol computing the slack matrix
of $P$ in expectation. We show that allowing randomization in the protocol can be crucial for obtaining
small extended formulations. Specifically, we prove that for the spanning tree and perfect matching
polytopes, small variance in the protocol forces large size in the extended formulation.
