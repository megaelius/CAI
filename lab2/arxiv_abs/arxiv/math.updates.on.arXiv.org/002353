The main subject of this paper is equilibrium problems on an unbounded conductor $\Sigma$ of the
complex plane in the presence of a weakly admissible external field. An admissible external field
$Q$ on $\Sigma$ satisfies, along with other mild conditions, the following growth property at infinity:
$$\lim_{|x| \rightarrow \infty}(Q(x) - \log |x|) = +\infty.$$ This condition guarantees the existence
and uniqueness of the equilibrium measure in the presence of $Q$, and the compactness of its support.
In the last 10-15 years, several papers have dealt with weakly admissible external fields, in the
sense that $Q$ satisfies a weaker condition at infinity, namely, $$\exists M\in(-\infty,\infty],\quad\liminf_{|x|
\rightarrow \infty}(Q(x) - \log |x|) = M.$$ Under this last assumption, there still exists a unique
equilibrium measure in the external field $Q$, but the support need not be a compact subset of $\Sigma$
anymore. In most examples considered in the literature the support is indeed unbounded. Our main
goal in this paper is to illustrate this topic by means of a simple class of external fields on the real
axis created by a pair of attractive and repellent charges in the complex plane, and to study the dynamics
of the associated equilibrium measures as the strength of the charges evolves. As one of our findings,
we exhibit configurations where the support of the equilibrium measure in a weakly admissible external
field is a compact subset of the real axis. To achieve our goal, we extend some results from potential
theory, known for admissible external fields, to the weakly admissible case. These new results
may be of independent interest. Finally, the so--called signed equilibrium measure is an important
tool in our analysis. Its relationship with the (positive) equilibrium measure is also explored.
