The Riemannian barycentre is one of the most widely used statistical descriptors for probability
distributions on Riemannian manifolds. At present, existing algorithms are able to compute the
Riemannian barycentre of a probability distribution, only if i.i.d. samples of this distribution
are readily available. However, there are many cases where i.i.d. samples are quite difficult to
obtain, and have to be replaced with non-independent samples, generated by a Markov chain Monte
Carlo method. To overcome this difficulty, the present paper proposes a new Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm for computing the Riemannian barycentre of a probability distribution on a Hadamard
manifold (a simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature). This
algorithm relies on two original propositions, proved in the paper. The first proposition states
that the recursive barycentre of samples generated from a geometrically ergodic Markov chain converges
in the mean-square to the Riemannian barycentre of the stationary distribution of this chain. The
second proposition provides verifiable conditions which ensure a Metropolis-Hastings Markov
chain, with its values in a symmetric Hadamard manifold, is geometrically ergodic. This latter
result yields a partial solution, in the context of Riemannian manifolds, to the problem of geometric
ergodicity of Metropolis-Hastings chains, which has previously attracted extensive attention
when considered in Euclidean space. In addition to these two propositions, the new Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm, proposed in this paper, is applied to a problem of Bayesian inference, arising
from computer vision.
