This paper is concerned with global existence as well as infinite-time blowups of classical solutions
to the following fully parabolic kinetic system \begin{equation} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta (\gamma
(v)u) v_t-\Delta v+v=u \end{cases} \qquad(0.1)\end{equation} in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$,
$n\geq1$ with no-flux boundary conditions. This model was recently proposed in [8,20] to describe
the process of stripe pattern formations via the so-called self-trapping mechanism. The system
features a signal-dependent motility function $\gamma(\cdot)$, which is decreasing in $v$ and
will vanish as $v$ tends to infinity. The major difficulty in analysis comes from the possible degeneracy
as $v\nearrow+\infty.$ In this work we develop a new comparison method different from the conventional
energy method in literature, which reveals a striking fact that there is no finite-time degeneracy
in this system. More precisely, we use comparison principles for elliptic and parabolic equations
to prove that degeneracy cannot take place in finite time in any spatial dimensions for all smooth
motility functions satisfying $\gamma(s)>0$, $\gamma'(s)\leq0$ when $s\geq0$ and $\lim\limits_{s\rightarrow+\infty}\gamma(s)=0.$
Then we investigate global existence of classical solutions to (0.1) when $n\leq3$ and discuss
the uniform-in-time boundedness under certain growth conditions on $1/\gamma.$ In particular,
we consider system (0.1) with $\gamma(v)=e^{-v}$. We prove that classical solution always exists
globally, which must be uniformly-in-time bounded with arbitrary initial data of sub-critical
mass. On the contrary, with certain initial data of super-critical mass, the solution will become
unbounded at time infinity which differs from the finite-time blowup behavior of the Keller--Segel
model.
