We study the properties of finite graphs in which the ball of radius $r$ around each vertex induces
a graph isomorphic to the ball of radius $r$ in some fixed vertex transitive graph $F$. This is a natural
extension of the study of regular graphs. Let $\mathbb{L}^d$ denote the standard Cayley graph of
$\mathbb{Z}^d$. In a previous work, the authors obtained a characterisation of all the $n$-vertex
graphs in which the ball of radius $r$ around each vertex is isomorphic to the ball of radius $r$ in
$\mathbb{L}^d$, for each pair of integers $d,r$ such that $d \geq 2$ and $r \geq 3$. These graphs have
a very rigidly proscribed global structure, much more so than that of $(2d)$-regular graphs. In
this paper, we estimate the number of unlabelled, $n$-vertex graphs which have the above property
(in the case where $r$ is at least linear in $d$). This number grows like a stretched-exponential,
in contrast with the situation for regular graphs. We use this estimate to obtain results on the typical
properties of a uniform random such graph. We then consider the (much) more general case where $F$
is a connected, locally finite Cayley graph of a torsion-free group of polynomial growth. Using
recent results of De La Salle and Tessera, and some other results and techniques from both group theory
and combinatorics, we show that in this case, there exists a positive integer $r_0$ depending on
$F$ alone, such that for all $r \geq r_0$, a uniform random unlabelled $n$-vertex graph in which the
ball of radius $r$ around each vertex is isomorphic to the ball of radius $r$ in $F$, has largest component
of order at most $n^{5/6}$, and has non-trivial automorphism group, with high probability. This
again contrasts with the situation for regular graphs. We make several conjectures regarding what
happens for locally finite Cayley graphs of other finitely generated groups.
