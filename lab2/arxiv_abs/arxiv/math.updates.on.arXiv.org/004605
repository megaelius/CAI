We study the problem of high-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with missing observations.
In simple, homogeneous missingness settings with a noise level of constant order, we show that an
existing inverse-probability weighted (IPW) estimator of the leading principal components can
(nearly) attain the minimax optimal rate of convergence. However, deeper investigation reveals
both that, particularly in more realistic settings where the missingness mechanism is heterogeneous,
the empirical performance of the IPW estimator can be unsatisfactory, and moreover that, in the
noiseless case, it fails to provide exact recovery of the principal components. Our main contribution,
then, is to introduce a new method for high-dimensional PCA, called `primePCA', that is designed
to cope with situations where observations may be missing in a heterogeneous manner. Starting from
the IPW estimator, primePCA iteratively projects the observed entries of the data matrix onto the
column space of our current estimate to impute the missing entries, and then updates our estimate
by computing the leading right singular space of the imputed data matrix. It turns out that the interaction
between the heterogeneity of missingness and the low-dimensional structure is crucial in determining
the feasibility of the problem. We therefore introduce an incoherence condition on the principal
components and prove that in the noiseless case, the error of primePCA converges to zero at a geometric
rate when the signal strength is not too small. An important feature of our theoretical guarantees
is that they depend on average, as opposed to worst-case, properties of the missingness mechanism.
Our numerical studies on both simulated and real data reveal that primePCA exhibits very encouraging
performance across a wide range of scenarios.
