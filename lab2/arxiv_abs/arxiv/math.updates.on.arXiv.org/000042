Interference alignment is a key technique for communication scenarios with multiple interfering
links. In several such scenarios, interference alignment was used to characterize the degrees-of-freedom
of the channel. However, these degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak
to make accurate predictions about the behavior of channel capacity at finite signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). The aim of this paper is to significantly strengthen these results by showing that
interference alignment can be used to characterize capacity to within a constant gap. We focus on
real, time-invariant, frequency-flat X-channels. The only known solutions achieving the degrees-of-freedom
of this channel are either based on real interference alignment or on layer-selection schemes.
Neither of these solutions seems sufficient for a constant-gap capacity approximation. In this
paper, we propose a new communication scheme and show that it achieves the capacity of the Gaussian
X-channel to within a constant gap. To aid in this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel
model. This deterministic model depends on the 0.5log(SNR) most-significant bits of the channel
coefficients rather than only the single most-significant bit used in conventional deterministic
models. The proposed deterministic model admits a wider range of achievable schemes that can be
translated to the Gaussian channel. For this deterministic model, we find an approximately optimal
communication scheme. We then translate this scheme for the deterministic channel to the original
Gaussian X-channel and show that it achieves capacity to within a constant gap. This is the first
constant-gap result for a general, fully-connected network requiring interference alignment.
