Poly-bicategories, introduced by Cockett, Koslowski, and Seely, generalise planar polycategories
in the same way as bicategories generalise monoidal categories. In a poly-bicategory, the existence
of enough 2-cells that satisfy certain universal properties (representability) induces a coherent
algebraic structure on the 2-graph of single-input, single-output 2-cells. A special case of this
theory was used by Hermida to produce a new proof of strictification for bicategories. The basic
strategy seems generalisable, yet no full strictification is possible for higher-dimensional
categories, seemingly due to problems with 2-cells that have degenerate boundaries. It was conjectured
by C. Simpson that semi-strictification excluding weak units may be possible. In this article,
we study poly-bicategories where 2-cells with degenerate boundaries are barred, and show that
we can recover the coherent structure of a bicategory through a different construction of weak units,
inspired by the Saavedra units of J. Kock. We prove that the existence of these weak units is equivalent
to the existence of 1-cells satisfying lower-dimensional universal properties, and study the
relation between preservation of units and preservation of universal cells. Then, we introduce
merge-bicategories, a variant of poly-bicategories with more composition operations, which
admits a natural monoidal closed structure, giving access to higher morphisms. We derive equivalences
between morphisms, transformations, and modifications of representable merge-bicategories
and the corresponding notions for bicategories. Finally, we prove a semi-strictification theorem
for representable merge-bicategories with a choice of composites and units.
