String diagrams turn algebraic equations into topological moves that have recurring shapes, involving
the sliding of one diagram past another. We individuate, at the root of this fact, the dual nature
of polygraphs as presentations of higher algebraic theories, and as combinatorial descriptions
of "directed spaces". Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of topological spaces are
used as the foundation of a compositional universal algebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor
products of polygraphs. We reconstruct several higher algebraic theories in this framework. In
this regard, the standard formalism of polygraphs has some technical problems. We propose a notion
of regular polygraph, barring cell boundaries that are not homeomorphic to a disk of the appropriate
dimension. We define a category of non-degenerate shapes, and show how to calculate their tensor
products. Then, we introduce a notion of weak unit to recover weakly degenerate boundaries in low
dimensions, and prove that the existence of weak units is equivalent to a representability property.
We then turn to applications of diagrammatic algebra to quantum theory. We re-evaluate the category
of Hilbert spaces from the perspective of categorical universal algebra, which leads to a bicategorical
refinement. Then, we focus on the axiomatics of fragments of quantum theory, and present the ZW calculus,
the first complete diagrammatic axiomatisation of the theory of qubits. The ZW calculus has several
advantages over ZX calculi, including a computationally meaningful normal form, and a fragment
whose diagrams can be read as setups of fermionic oscillators. Moreover, its generators reflect
an operational classification of entangled states of 3 qubits. We conclude with generalisations
of the ZW calculus to higher-dimensional systems, including the definition of a universal set of
generators in each dimension.
