Consider random $d$-regular graphs, i.e., random graphs such that there are exactly $d$ edges from
each vertex for some $d\ge 3$. We study both the configuration model version of this graph, which
has occasional multi-edges and self-loops, as well as the simple version of it, which is a $d$-regular
graph chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all $d$-regular graphs. In this paper, we
discuss mixing times of Glauber dynamics for the Ising model with an external magnetic field on a
random $d$-regular graph, both in the quenched as well as the annealed settings. Let $\beta$ be the
inverse temperature, $\beta_c$ be the critical temperature and $B$ be the external magnetic field.
Concerning the annealed measure, we show that for $\beta > \beta_c$ there exists $\hat{B}_c(\beta)\in
(0,\infty)$ such that the model is metastable (i.e., the mixing time is exponential in the graph
size $n$) when $\beta> \beta_c$ and $0 \leq B < \hat{B}_c(\beta)$, whereas it exhibits the cut-off
phenomenon at $c_\star n \log n$ with a window of order $n$ when $\beta < \beta_c$ or $\beta > \beta_c$
and $B>\hat{B}_c(\beta)$. Interestingly, $\hat{B}_c(\beta)$ coincides with the critical external
field of the Ising model on the $d$-ary tree (namely, above which the model has a unique Gibbs measure).
Concerning the quenched measure, we show that there exists $B_c(\beta)$ with $B_c(\beta) \leq
\hat{B}_c(\beta)$ such that for $\beta> \beta_c$, the mixing time is at least exponential along
some subsequence $(n_k)_{k\geq 1}$ when $0 \leq B < B_c(\beta)$, whereas it is less than or equal
to $Cn\log n$ when $B>\hat{B}_c(\beta)$. The quenched results also hold for the model conditioned
on simplicity, for the annealed results this is unclear.
