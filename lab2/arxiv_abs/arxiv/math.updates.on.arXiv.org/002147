Newton revealed an underlying duality relation between power potentials in classical mechanics.
In this paper, we establish the quantum version of the Newton duality. The main aim of this paper is
threefold: (1) first generalizing the original Newton duality to more general potentials, including
general polynomial potentials and transcendental-function potentials, 2) constructing a quantum
version of the Newton duality, including power potentials, general polynomial potentials, transcendental-function
potentials, and power potentials in different spatial dimensions, and 3) suggesting a method for
solving eigenproblems in quantum mechanics based on the quantum Newton duality provided in the
paper. The classical Newton duality is a duality among orbits of classical dynamical systems. Our
result shows that the Newton duality is not only limited to power potentials, but a more universal
duality relation among dynamical systems with various potentials. The key task of this paper is
to construct a quantum Newton duality, the quantum version of the classical Newton duality. The
quantum Newton duality provides a duality relations among wave functions and eigenvalues. As applications,
we suggest a method for solving potentials from their Newtonianly dual potential: once the solution
of a potential is known, the solution of all its dual potentials can be obtained by the duality transformation
directly. Using this method, we obtain a series of exact solutions of various potentials. In appendices,
as preparations, we solve the potentials which is solved by the Newton duality method in this paper
by directly solving the eigenequation.
