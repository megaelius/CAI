Multi-stage stochastic programming is a well-established framework for sequential decision
making under uncertainty by seeking policies that are fully adapted to the uncertainty. Often such
flexible policies are not desirable, and the decision maker may need to commit to a set of actions
for a number of planning periods. Two-stage stochastic programming might be better suited to such
settings, where the decisions for all periods are made here-and-now and do not adapt to the uncertainty
realized. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative approach, where the stages are not predetermined
but part of the optimization problem. Each component of the decision policy has an associated revision
point, a period prior to which the decision is predetermined and after which it is revised to adjust
to the uncertainty realized thus far. We motivate this setting using the multi-period newsvendor
problem by deriving an optimal adaptive policy. We label the proposed approach as adaptive two-stage
stochastic programming and provide a generic mixed-integer programming formulation for finite
stochastic processes. We show that adaptive two-stage stochastic programming is NP-hard in general.
Next, we derive bounds on the value of adaptive two-stage programming in comparison to the two-stage
and multi-stage approaches for a specific problem structure inspired by the capacity expansion
planning problem. Since directly solving the mixed-integer linear program associated with the
adaptive two-stage approach might be very costly for large instances, we propose several heuristic
solution algorithms based on the bound analysis. We provide approximation guarantees for these
heuristics. Finally, we present an extensive computational study on an electricity generation
capacity expansion planning problem and demonstrate the computational and practical impacts
of the proposed approach from various perspectives.
