A unified treatment for fast and spectrally accurate evaluation of electrostatic potentials subject
to periodic boundary conditions in any or none of the three space dimensions is presented. Ewald
decomposition is used to split the problem into a real space and a Fourier space part, and the FFT based
Spectral Ewald (SE) method is used to accelerate the computation of the latter. A key component in
the unified treatment is an FFT based solution technique for the free-space Poisson problem in three,
two or one dimensions, depending on the number of non-periodic directions. The cost of calculations
is furthermore reduced by employing an adaptive FFT for the doubly and singly periodic cases, allowing
for different local upsampling rates. The SE method will always be most efficient for the triply
periodic case as the cost for computing FFTs will be the smallest, whereas the computational cost
for the rest of the algorithm is essentially independent of the periodicity. We show that the cost
of removing periodic boundary conditions from one or two directions out of three will only marginally
increase the total run time. Our comparisons also show that the computational cost of the SE method
for the free-space case is typically about four times more expensive as compared to the triply periodic
case. The Gaussian window function previously used in the SE method, is here compared to an approximation
of the Kaiser-Bessel window function, recently introduced. With a carefully tuned shape parameter
that is selected based on an error estimate for this new window function, runtimes for the SE method
can be further reduced. Keywords: Fast Ewald summation, Fast Fourier transform, Arbitrary periodicity,
