For a scheme or topological space $X$, we realize the rational cohomology groups of its generalized
ordered configuration spaces as the factorization homology of $X$ with coefficients in certain
truncated twisted commutative algebras. Via Koszul duality, these cohomology groups can be computed
in terms of Lie algebra cohomology of certain twisted dg-Lie algebras which are explicit in many
cases. We provide, as applications, two flavors of higher representation stability for generalized
configuration spaces. Firstly, we provide an iterative procedure to study higher representation
stability using actions coming from the cohomology of $X$ and compute explicit bounds for the derived
indecomposables, i.e. higher analogs of $\mathrm{FI}$-hyperhomology, for generalized configuration
spaces of $X$. More qualitatively, we also prove that all the modules that appear are finitely generated
over the corresponding twisted commutative algebras. Secondly, we prove that when $X$ satisfies
$\mathrm{T}_m$, a condition regarding the vanishing of certain $C_\infty$-operations on the
rational cohomology of $X$, the rational cohomology of its ordered configuration spaces form a
free module over a twisted commutative algebra built out of the ordered configuration spaces of
the affine space. This generalizes a result of Church-Ellenberg-Farb on the freeness of $\mathrm{FI}$-modules
arising from the cohomology of ordered configuration spaces of open manifolds (which corresponds
to the case where $m=1$) and, moreover, establishes higher representation stability for ordered
configuration spaces, resolving the various conjectures of Miller-Wilson this case.
