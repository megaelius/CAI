Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Stations (UAVBSs) are envisioned to be an integral component of the
next generation Wireless Communications Networks (WCNs) by dynamically moving the supply towards
the demand. A significant drawback of the state-of-the-art have been designing a WCN in which the
service-oriented performance measures (e.g., throughput) are optimized without considering
different relevant decisions such as determining the location and allocating the resources, jointly.
In this study, we address the UAVBS location and bandwidth allocation problems together to optimize
the total network profit. In particular, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) formulation
is developed, in which the location of a single UAVBS and bandwidth allocations to users are jointly
determined. The objective is to maximize the total profit without exceeding the backhaul and access
capacities. The profit gained from a specific user is assumed to be a piecewise-linear function
of the provided data rate level, where higher data rate levels would yield higher profit. Due to high
complexity of the MINLP, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm with lower computational
complexity. We show that, when the UAVBS location is determined, the resource allocation problem
can be reduced to a Multidimensional Binary Knapsack Problem (MBKP), which can be solved in pseudo-polynomial
time. To exploit this structure, the optimal bandwidth allocations are determined by solving several
MBKPs in a search algorithm. We test the performance of our algorithm with two heuristics and with
the MINLP model solved by a commercial solver. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the alternative solution approaches and would be a promising tool to improve the total
network profit.
