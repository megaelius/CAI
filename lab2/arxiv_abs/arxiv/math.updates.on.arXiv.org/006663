We propose a method for proving that a toral partition into polygons is a Markov partition for a given
toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotation ($\mathbb{Z}^2$-action defined by rotations on a torus). If $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P},R}$
denotes the symbolic dynamical system corresponding to a partition $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action
$R$ such that $R$ is Cartesian on a sub-domain $W$, we express the 2-dimensional configurations
in $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P},R}$ as the image under a $2$-dimensional morphism (up to a shift)
of a configuration in $\mathcal{X}_{\widehat{\mathcal{P}}|_W,\widehat{R}|_W}$ where $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}|_W$
is the induced partition and $\widehat{R}|_W$ is the induced $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on the sub-domain
$W$. The induced $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action extends the notion of Rauzy induction of IETs to the case
of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions where subactions are polytope exchange ransformation (PETs). This
allows to describe $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P},R}$ by a $S$-adic sequence of 2-dimensional morphisms.
We apply the method on one example and we obtain a sequence of 2-dimensional morphisms which is eventually
periodic leading to a self-induced partition. We prove that its substitutive structure is the same
as the substitutive structure of the minimal subshift $X_0$ of the Jeandel-Rao Wang shift computed
in an earlier work by the author. As a consequence, we deduce the equality of the two subshifts and
it implies that the partition is a Markov partition for the associated toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotation
since $X_0$ is a shift of finite type (SFT). It also implies that $X_0$ is uniquely ergodic and is isomorphic
to the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotation $R_0$ which can be seen as a generalization for 2-dimensional
subshifts of the relation between Sturmian sequences and irrational rotations on a circle. Batteries
included: the algorithms and the code to reproduce the proofs are provided.
