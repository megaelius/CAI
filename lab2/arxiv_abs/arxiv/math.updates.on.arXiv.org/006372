We show that any $\ell$-controllable complete group system $\mathsf{C}$ can be reduced to a generator
group $({\mathcal{U}}_g,\circ)$. The set ${\mathcal{U}}_g$ is defined on a double Cartesian
product space, with indices $k$, for $0\le k\le\ell$, and time $t$, for $t\in\mathbf{Z}$. Each
index $k$ and time $t$ is associated with a set $G_k^t$ of \glabs\ $g_k^t$. Each $g_k^t$ is the label
of a generator in $\mathsf{C}$ defined for the time interval $[t,t+k]$. The operation $\circ$ is
a global operation defined on the sets $G_k^t$ in ${\mathcal{U}}_g$, for $0\le k\le\ell$ and $t\in\mathbf{Z}$.
We show the generator group contains an infinite collection of elementary groups, one for each $k$
and $t$, defined on small subsets of ${\mathcal{U}}_g$, in the shape of triangles, which form a tile
like structure over ${\mathcal{U}}_g$. There is a homomorphism from each elementary group to any
elementary group wholely contained in the former group. The generator group without its global
operation $\circ$ forms an elementary system $\mathcal{E}$. An elementary system is an elementary
set, such as ${\mathcal{U}}_g$, an infinite collection of nested elementary groups defined on
triangular subsets of the elementary set, and a homomorphism condition. There is a homomorphism
from each elementary group to the two largest elementary groups nested in the former group. Then
any generator group and any $\ell$-controllable complete group system $\mathsf{C}$ can be reduced
to an elementary system $\mathcal{E}$. This process can be reversed. We can construct any $\ell$-controllable
complete group system $\mathsf{C}$ starting with an elementary system $\mathcal{E}$. This process
is straightforward since $\mathcal{E}$ is nested in index $k$. We extend these results to block
codes and obtain new results on the group structure of block codes.
