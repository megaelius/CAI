Supersymmetric D-branes supported on the complex two-dimensional base $S$ of the local Calabi-Yau
threefold $\mathcal{O}_S(-K_S)$ are described by semi-stable coherent sheaves on $S$. Under
suitable conditions, the BPS indices counting these objects (known as generalized Donaldson-Thomas
invariants) coincide with the Vafa-Witten invariants of $S$ (which encode the Betti numbers of
the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves). For surfaces which admit a strong collection of exceptional
sheaves, we develop a general method for computing these invariants by exploiting the isomorphism
between the derived category of coherent sheaves and the derived category of representations of
a suitable quiver with potential $(Q,W)$ constructed from the exceptional collection. We spell
out the dictionary between the Chern class $\gamma$ and polarization $J$ on $S$ vs. the dimension
vector $\vec N$ and stability parameters $\vec\zeta$ on the quiver side. For all examples that we
consider, which include all del Pezzo and Hirzebruch surfaces, we find that the BPS indices $\Omega_\star(\gamma)$
at the attractor point (or self-stability condition) vanish, except for dimension vectors corresponding
to simple representations and pure D0-branes. This opens up the possibility to compute the BPS indices
in any chamber using either the flow tree or the Coulomb branch formula. In all cases we find precise
agreement with independent computations of Vafa-Witten invariants based on wall-crossing and
blow-up formulae. This agreement suggests that i) generating functions of DT invariants for a large
class of quivers coming from strong exceptional collections are mock modular functions of higher
depth and ii) non-trivial single-centered black holes and scaling solutions do not exist quantum
mechanically in such local Calabi-Yau geometries.
