This paper studies a 3D multiplayer reach-avoid differential game with a goal region and a play region.
Multiple pursuers defend the goal region by consecutively capturing multiple evaders in the play
region. The players have heterogeneous moving speeds and the pursuers have heterogeneous capture
radii. Since this game is hard to analyze directly, we decompose the whole game as many subgames which
involve multiple pursuers and only one evader. Then, these subgames are used as a building block
for the pursuer-evader matching. First, for multiple pursuers and one evader, we introduce an evasion
space (ES) method characterized by a potential function to construct a guaranteed pursuer winning
strategy. Then, based on this strategy, we develop conditions to determine whether a pursuit team
can guard the goal region against one evader. It is shown that in 3D, if a pursuit team is able to defend
the goal region against an evader, then at most three pursuers in the team are necessarily needed.
We also compute the value function of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation for a special subgame
of degree. To capture the maximum number of evaders in the open-loop sense, we formulate a maximum
bipartite matching problem with conflict graph (MBMC). We show that the MBMC is NP-hard and design
a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm to solve it. Finally, we propose a
receding horizon strategy for the pursuit team where in each horizon an MBMC is solved and the strategies
of the pursuers are given. We also extend our results to the case of a bounded convex play region where
the evaders escape through an exit. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the obtained
results.
