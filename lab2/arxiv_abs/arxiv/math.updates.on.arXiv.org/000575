Ramsey theory is the study of conditions under which mathematical objects show order when partitioned.
Ramsey theory on the integers concerns itself with partitions of $[1,n]$ into $r$ subsets and asks
the question whether one (or more) of these $r$ subsets contains a $k$-term member of $\mathcal{F}$,
where $[1,n]=\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a certain family of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^+$.
When $\mathcal{F}$ is fixed to be the set of arithmetic progressions, the corresponding Ramsey-type
numbers are called the van der Waerden numbers. I started the project choosing $\mathcal{F}$ to
be the set of semi-progressions of scope $m$. A semi-progression of scope $m\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ is
a set of integers $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k\}$ such that for some $d\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, $x_{i}-x_{i-1}\in\{d,2d,\ldots,md\}$
for all $i\in\{2,3,\ldots,k\}$. The exact values of Ramsey-type functions corresponding to semi-progressions
are not known. We use $SP_m(k)$ to denote these numbers as a Ramsey-type function of $k$ for a fixed
scope $m$. During this project, I used the probabilistic method to get an exponential lower bound
for any fixed $m$. The first chapter starts with a brief introduction to Ramsey theory and then explains
the problem considered. In the second chapter, I give the results obtained on semi-progressions.
In the third chapter, I will discuss the lower bound obtained on $Q_1(k)$. When $\mathcal{F}$ is
chosen to be quasi-progressions of diameter $n$, the corresponding Ramsey-type numbers obtained
are denoted as $Q_n(k)$. The last chapter gives an exposition of advanced probabilistic techniques,
in particular concentration inequalities and how to apply them.
