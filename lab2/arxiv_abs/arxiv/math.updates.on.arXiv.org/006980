A nonparametric method to predict non-Markovian time series of partially observed dynamics is
developed. The prediction problem we consider is a supervised learning task of finding a regression
function that takes a delay embedded observable to the observable at a future time. When delay embedding
theory is applicable, the proposed regression function is a consistent estimator of the flow map
induced by the delay embedding. Furthermore, the corresponding Mori-Zwanzig equation governing
the evolution of the observable simplifies to only a Markovian term, represented by the regression
function. We realize this supervised learning task with a class of kernel-based linear estimators,
the kernel analog forecast (KAF), which are consistent in the limit of large data. In a scenario with
a high-dimensional covariate space, we employ a Markovian kernel smoothing method which is computationally
cheaper than the Nystr\"om projection method for realizing KAF. In addition to the guaranteed theoretical
convergence, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on higher-dimensional
problems where the relevant kernel features are difficult to capture with the Nystr\"om method.
Given noisy training data, we propose a nonparametric smoother as a de-noising method. Numerically,
we show that the proposed smoother is more accurate than EnKF and 4Dvar in de-noising signals corrupted
by independent (but not necessarily identically distributed) noise, even if the smoother is constructed
using a data set corrupted by white noise. We show skillful prediction using the KAF constructed
from the denoised data.
