We associate to a projective $n$-dimensional toric variety $X_{\Delta}$ a pair of co-commutative
(but generally non-commutative) Hopf algebras $H^{\alpha}_X, H^{T}_X$. These arise as Hall algebras
of certain categories $Coh^{\alpha}(X), \emph{Coh}^T(X)$ of coherent sheaves on $X_{\Delta}$
viewed as a monoid scheme - i.e. a scheme obtained by gluing together spectra of commutative monoids
rather than rings. When $X$ is smooth, the category $\emph{Coh}^T(X)$ has an explicit combinatorial
description as sheaves whose restriction to each $\mathbb{A}^n$ corresponding to a maximal cone
is determined by an $n$-dimensional generalized skew shape. The (non-additive) categories $\emph{Coh}^{\alpha}(X),
\emph{Coh}^T(X)$ are treated via the formalism of proto-exact/proto-abelian categories developed
by Dyckerhoff-Kapranov. The Hall algebras $H^{\alpha}_X, H^{T}_X$ are graded and connected,
and so enveloping algebras $H^{\alpha}_X \simeq U(\mathfrak{n}^{\alpha}_X)$, $H^{T}_X \simeq
U(\mathfrak{n}^{T}_X)$, where the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{n}^{\alpha}_X, \mathfrak{n}^{T}_X$
are spanned by the indecomposable coherent sheaves in their respective categories. We explicitly
work out several examples, and in some cases are able to relate $\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ to known Lie algebras.
In particular, when $X = \mathbb{P}^1$, $\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ is isomorphic to a non-standard Borel
in $\mathfrak{gl}_2 [t,t^{-1}]$. When $X$ is the second infinitesimal neighborhood of the origin
inside $\mathbb{A}^2$, $\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ is isomorphic to a subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_2[t]$.
We also consider the case $X=\mathbb{P}^2$, where we give a basis for $\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ by describing
all indecomposable sheaves in $\emph{Coh}^T(X)$.
