Generalizations of tournaments has improved the understanding of topics such as hamiltonicity,
domination and pancyclicity. Bang-Jensen introduced some families of generalized tournaments
preserving nice properties of tournaments, for instance, locally in-/out-semicomplete digraphs
(digraphs such that for any vertex the in-/out-neighborhood induces a semicomplete digraph) as
well as some families of generalized bipartite tournaments, for instance arc-locally semicomplete
digraphs which are somehow close related to the locally semicomplete digraphs. Kernels is an important
topic in digraphs due to its theoretical interest as well as its many applications in areas such as
game theory, argumentation theory, logic, logic programming and artificial intelligence. A digraph
such that every proper induced subdigraph has a kernel is said to be \emph{kernel perfect} (KP for
short) (\emph{critical kernel imperfect} (CKI for short) resp.) if the digraph has a kernel (does
not have a kernel resp.). The unique CKI-tournament is $\overrightarrow{C}_3$ and the unique KP-tournaments
are the transitive tournaments, however bipartite tournaments are KP. Recently, the authors characterized
the locally semicomplete CKI-digraphs. In this paper we characterize the CKI- and KP-digraphs
for the following families of digraphs: locally in-/out-semicomplete, asymmetric arc-locally
in-/out-semicomplete, $3$-quasi-transitive and asymmetric $3$-anti-quasi-transitive $TT_3$-free
and we state that the problem of determinating if a digraph of one of these families is CKI is polinomial,
giving a solution to a problem closely related to the following conjecture posted by Bang-Jensen
in 1998: the kernel problem is polinomially solvable for locally in-semicomplete digraphs.
