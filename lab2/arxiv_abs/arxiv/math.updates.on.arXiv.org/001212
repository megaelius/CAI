We further explore the implications of our framework in [arXiv:1301.1977, arXiv:1309.4775],
and physically derive, from the principle that the spacetime BPS spectra of string-dual M-theory
compactifications ought to be equivalent, (i) a 5d AGT correspondence for any compact Lie group,
(ii) a 5d and 6d AGT correspondence on ALE space of type ADE, and (iii) identities between the ordinary,
q-deformed and elliptic affine W-algebras associated with the 4d, 5d and 6d AGT correspondence,
respectively, which also define a quantum geometric Langlands duality and its higher analogs formulated
by Feigin-Frenkel-Reshetikhin in [3,4]. As an offshoot, we are led to the sought-after connection
between the gauge-theoretic realization of the geometric Langlands correspondence by Kapustin-Witten
[5,6] and its algebraic CFT formulation by Beilinson-Drinfeld [7], where one can also understand
Wilson and 't Hooft-Hecke line operators in 4d gauge theory as monodromy loop operators in 2d CFT,
for example. In turn, this will allow us to argue that the higher 5d/6d analog of the geometric Langlands
correspondence for simply-laced Lie (Kac-Moody) groups G (G_k), ought to relate the quantization
of circle (elliptic)-valued G Hitchin systems to circle/elliptic-valued ^LG (^LG_k)-bundles
over a complex curve on one hand, and the transfer matrices of a G (G_k)-type XXZ/XYZ spin chain on
the other, where ^LG is the Langlands dual of G. Incidentally, the latter relation also serves as
an M-theoretic realization of Nekrasov-Pestun-Shatashvili's recent result in [8], which relates
the moduli space of 5d/6d supersymmetric G (G_k)-quiver SU(K_i) gauge theories to the representation
theory of quantum/elliptic affine (toroidal) G-algebras.
