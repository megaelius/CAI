Let $K$ be a simplicial $k$-complex and $M$ be a closed PL $2k$-manifold. Our aim is to describe an
obstruction for embeddability of $K$ into $M$ via the intersection form on $M$. For description
of the obstruction, we need a technical condition that every map $f\colon |K| \to M$ is homotopic
to a map $f'\colon |K| \to M$ such that $f'(|K^{(k-1)}|)$ fits into some $2k$-ball in $M$, where $K^{(k-1)}$
stands for the $(k-1)$-skeleton of $K$. The technical condition is satisfied, in particular, either
if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected or if $K$ is the $k$-skeleton of $n$-simplex, $\Delta_n^{(k)}$, for
some $n$. Under the technical condition, if $K$ embeds in $M$, then our obstruction vanishes. In
addition, if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected and $k \geq 3$, then the obstruction is complete, that is,
we get the reverse implication. If $M = S^{2k}$ (or $\mathbb{R}^{2k}$) then the intersection form
on $M$ vanishes and our obstruction coincides with the standard van Kampen obstruction. However,
if the intersection form is nontrivial, then our obstruction is not linear (a cohomology class)
but rather `quadratic' in a sense that it vanishes if and only if a certain system of quadratic equations
over integers is solvable. It remains to be determined whether these systems can be solved algorithmically.
Finally, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-reduction of the obstruction shows how to obtain a non-trivial upper
bound for the K\"{u}hnel problem: determine the smallest $n$ so that $\Delta_n^{(k)}$ does not
embed into $M$. Also, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-reduction is computable and, if $M$ is $(k-1)$-connected,
it determines whether there is a map $f\colon |K| \to M$ which has an even number of crossings of $f(\sigma)$
and $f(\tau)$ for each pair $(\sigma, \tau)$ of disjoint $k$-simplices of $K$.
