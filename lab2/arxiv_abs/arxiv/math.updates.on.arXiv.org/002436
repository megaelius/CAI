The first paper of this series presents a discretely entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
method for the resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations on three-dimensional curvilinear
unstructured hexahedral meshes. Compared to other fluid dynamics systems such as the shallow water
equations or the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the resistive MHD equations need special
considerations because of the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. For instance,
it is well known that for the symmetrization of the ideal MHD system as well as the continuous entropy
analysis a non-conservative term proportional to the divergence of the magnetic field, typically
referred to as the Powell term, must be included. As a consequence, the mimicry of the continuous
entropy analysis in the discrete sense demands a suitable DG approximation of the non-conservative
terms in addition to the ideal MHD terms. This paper focuses on the resistive MHD equations: Our first
contribution is a proof that the resistive terms are symmetric and positive-definite when formulated
in entropy space as gradients of the entropy variables. This enables us to show that the entropy inequality
holds for the resistive MHD equations. This continuous analysis is the key for our DG discretization
and guides the path for the construction of an approximation that discretely mimics the entropy
inequality, typically termed entropy stability. Our second contribution is a detailed derivation
and analysis of the discretization on three-dimensional curvilinear meshes. The discrete analysis
relies on the summation-by-parts property, which is satisfied by the DG spectral element method
(DGSEM) with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes. Although the divergence-free constraint is
included in the non-conservative terms, the resulting method has no particular treatment of the
magnetic field divergence errors...
