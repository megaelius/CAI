This paper contributes to the current studies on regularity properties of noncommutative distributions
in free probability theory. More precisely, we consider evaluations of selfadjoint noncommutative
polynomials in noncommutative random variables that have finite non-microstates free Fisher
information, highlighting the special case of Lipschitz conjugate variables. For the first time
in this generality, it is shown that the analytic distributions of those evaluations have H\"older
continuous cumulative distribution functions with an explicit H\"older exponent that depends
only on the degree of the considered polynomial. For linear polynomials, we reach in the case of finite
non-microstates free Fisher information the optimal H\"older exponent $\frac{2}{3}$, and get
Lipschitz continuity in the case of Lipschitz conjugate variables. In particular, our results
guarantee that such polynomial evaluations have finite logarithmic energy and thus finite (non-microstates)
free entropy, which partially settles a conjecture of Charlesworth and Shlyakhtenko [CS16]. We
further provide a very general criterion that gives for weak approximations of measures having
H\"older continuous cumulative distribution functions explicit rates of convergence in terms
of the Kolmogorov distance. Finally, we combine these results to study the asymptotic eigenvalue
distributions of polynomials in GUEs or matrices with more general Gibbs laws. For Gibbs laws, this
extends the corresponding result obtained in [GS09] from convergence in distribution to convergence
in Kolmogorov distance; in the GUE case, we even provide explicit rates, which quantify results
of [HT05,HST06] in terms of the Kolmogorov distance.
