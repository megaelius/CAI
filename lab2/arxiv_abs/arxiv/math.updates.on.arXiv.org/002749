We study queue-based activation protocols in random-access networks. The network is modeled as
an interference graph. Each node of the graph represents a server with a queue. Packets arrive at
the nodes as independent Poisson processes and have independent exponentially distributed sizes.
Each node can be either active or inactive. When a node is active, it deactivates at unit rate. When
a node is inactive, it activates at a rate that depends on its current queue length, provided none
of its neighboring nodes is active. Thus, two nodes that are connected by a bond cannot be active simultaneously.
This situation arises in random-access wireless networks where, due to interference, servers
that are close to each other cannot use the same frequency band. In the limit as the queue lengths at
the nodes become very large, we compute the transition time between the two states where one half
of the network is active and the other half is inactive. We compare the transition time with that of
a network in which the activation rates are not controlled by the queue length but are externally
driven, a situation that was dealt with in an earlier paper. Namely, we first sandwich the transition
time between that of two networks in which the activation rates are small perturbations of a certain
prescribed function of the mean queue length. After that we show that, as the perturbation tends
to zero, the two transition times become asymptotically similar. We focus on a complete bipartite
network: we identify the scale of the transition time in terms of the model parameters and we show
that its law on the scale of its mean has a trichotomy depending on the aggressiveness of the activation
rates. Our aim in future work is to use similar comparison techniques for more general bipartite
networks and for more complicated queue-based activation protocols.
