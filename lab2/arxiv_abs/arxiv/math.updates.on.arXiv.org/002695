This paper is concerned with the design of a distributed cooperative synchronization controller
for a class of higher-order nonlinear multi-agent systems. The objective is to achieve synchronization
and satisfy a predefined time-based performance. Dynamics of the agents (also called the nodes)
are assumed to be unknown to the controller and are estimated using Neural Networks. The proposed
robust neuro-adaptive controller drives different states of nodes systematically to synchronize
with the state of the leader node within the constraints of the prescribed performance. The nodes
are connected through a weighted directed graph with a time-invariant topology. Only few nodes
have access to the leader. Lyapunov-based stability proofs demonstrate that the multi-agent system
is uniformly ultimately bounded stable. Highly nonlinear heterogeneous networked systems with
uncertain parameters and external disturbances were used to validate the robustness and performance
of the new novel approach. Simulation results considered two different examples: single-input
single-output and multi-input multi-output, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
controller. Keywords: Prescribed performance, Transformed error, Multi-agents, Neuro-Adaptive,
