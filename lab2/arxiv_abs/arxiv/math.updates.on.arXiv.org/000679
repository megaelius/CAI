For a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter
$H> \frac12$ it is known that the existing (naive) Euler scheme has the rate of convergence $n^{1-2H}$,
which means no convergence to zero of the error when $H$ is formally set to $\frac 12$ (the standard
Brownian motion case). In this paper we introduce a new (modified Euler) approximation scheme which
is closer to the classical Euler scheme for diffusion processes and it has the rate of convergence
$\gamma_n^{-1}$, where $ \gamma_n=n^{ 2H-\frac 12}$ when $H < \frac 34$, $ \gamma_n= n/ \sqrt{
\log n } $ when $H=\frac 34$ and $\gamma_n=n$ if $H>\frac 34$. In particular, the rate of convergence
becomes $n^{-\frac 12}$ when $H$ is formally set to $\frac 12$. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic
behavior of the fluctuations of the error. More precisely, if $\{X_t, 0\le t\le T\}$ is the solution
of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion and if $\{X_t^n, 0\le
t\le T\}$ is its approximation obtained by the new modified Euler scheme, then we prove that $\gamma_n
(X^n-X)$ converges stably to the solution of a linear stochastic differential equation driven
by a matrix-valued Brownian motion, when $H\in (\frac 12, \frac 34]$. In the case $H > \frac34$,
we show the $L^p$ convergence of $n(X^n_t-X_t)$ and the limiting process is identified as the solution
of a linear stochastic differential equation driven by a matrix-valued Rosenblatt process. The
rate of weak convergence is also deduced for this scheme. We also apply our approach to the naive Euler
scheme. The main tools are fractional calculus, Malliavin calculus, and the fourth moment theorem.
