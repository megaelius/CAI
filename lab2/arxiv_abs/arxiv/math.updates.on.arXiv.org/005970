Due to the wide separation of time scales in geophysical fluid dynamics, semi-implicit time integrators
are commonly used in operational atmospheric forecast models. They guarantee the stable treatment
of fast (acoustic and gravity) waves, while not suffering from severe restrictions on the timestep
size. To propagate the state of the atmosphere forward in time, a non-linear equation for the prognostic
variables has to be solved at every timestep. Since the nonlinearity is typically weak, this is done
with a small number of Newton- or Picard- iterations, which in turn require the efficient solution
of a large system on linear equations with $\mathcal{O}(10^6-10^9)$ unknowns. This linear solve
is often the computationally most costly part of the model. While the solution of the linear system
is relatively straightforward for simple finite-difference- and finite-volume- discretisations,
it is much more challenging for advanced finite element discretisations, which have recently been
explored in atmospheric modelling. In this paper an efficient linear solver for the LFRic next-generation
model, currently developed by the Met Office, is described. The model uses an advanced mimetic finite
element discretisation which makes the construction of efficient solvers challenging. The linear
solver hinges on a bespoke multigrid preconditioner of the Schur-complement system for the pressure
correction. By comparing to Krylov-subspace methods, the superior performance and robustness
of the multigrid algorithm is demonstrated for standard test cases and realistic model setups.
In production mode, the model will have to run in parallel on 100,000s of processing elements. As
confirmed by numerical experiments, one particular advantage of the multigrid solver is its excellent
parallel scalability due to avoiding expensive global reduction operations.
