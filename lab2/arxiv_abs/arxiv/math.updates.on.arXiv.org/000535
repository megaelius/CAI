High-order reconstruction schemes for the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws in orthogonal
curvilinear coordinates are revised in the finite volume approach. The formulation employs a piecewise
polynomial approximation to the zone-average values to reconstruct left and right interface states
from within a computational zone to arbitrary order of accuracy by inverting a Vandermonde-like
linear system of equations with spatially varying coefficients. The approach is general and can
be used on uniform and non-uniform meshes although explicit expressions are derived for polynomials
from second to fifth degree in cylindrical and spherical geometries with uniform grid spacing.
It is shown that, in regions of large curvature, the resulting expressions differ considerably
from their Cartesian counterparts and that the lack of such corrections can severely degrade the
accuracy of the solution close to the coordinate origin. Limiting techniques and monotonicity
constraints are revised for conventional reconstruction schemes, namely, the piecewise linear
method (PLM), third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme and the piecewise
parabolic method (PPM). The performance of the improved reconstruction schemes is investigated
in a number of selected numerical benchmarks involving the solution of both scalar and systems of
nonlinear equations (such as the equations of gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics) in cylindrical
and spherical geometries in one and two dimensions. Results confirm that the proposed approach
yields considerably smaller errors, higher convergence rates and it avoid spurious numerical
effects at a symmetry axis.
