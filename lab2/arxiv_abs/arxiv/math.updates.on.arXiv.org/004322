Frequency-domain electromagnetic instruments allow for the collection of data in different configurations,
i.e. varying the inter-coil spacing, the frequency, and the height above the ground. This makes
these tools very practical, also because of their handy size, for the characterization of the near
surface in many fields of applications, e.g., precision agriculture, pollution assessments,
shallow geological investigations. To this end, the inversion of either the in-phase or the quadrature
component of the signal has been already studied. Furthermore, in some occasion not enough attention
is paid to the a priori information available on the solution, and a smoothness condition is blindly
imposed to regularization techniques, regardless of the solution properties. The present work
discusses an algorithm for the inversion of the complex signal in its entirety, as well as a regularization
method promoting the sparsity of the reconstructed electrical conductivity distribution. This
regularization strategy incorporates a minimum gradient support stabilizer into a truncated
generalized singular value decomposition scheme. The results of the implementation of this sparsity
enhancing regularization at each step of a damped Gauss--Newton inversion algorithm (based on
a nonlinear forward model) are compared against the associated solutions obtained via a standard
smooth stabilizer. Moreover, we also discuss an approach to estimate the depth of investigation
(DOI), i.e., the maximum depth that can be investigated by a chosen instrument configuration in
a particular experimental setting. The effectiveness and limitations of the whole inversion algorithm
are demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets.
