Augmented Lagrangian methods are among the most popular first-order approaches to handle large
scale semidefinite programs. In particular, alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMMs),
which are a variant of augmented Lagrangian methods, gained attention during the past decade. In
this paper, we focus on solving doubly nonnegative programs (DNN), which are semidefinite programs
where the elements of the matrix variable are constrained to be nonnegative. Starting from two algorithms
already proposed in the literature on conic programming, we introduce two new ADMMs by employing
a factorization of the dual variable. It is well known that first order methods are not suitable to
compute high precision optimal solutions, however an optimal solution of moderate precision often
suffices to get high quality lower bounds on the primal optimal objective function value. We present
methods to obtain such bounds by either perturbing the dual objective function value or by constructing
a dual feasible solution from a dual approximate optimal solution. Both procedures can be used as
a post-processing phase in our ADMMs. Numerical results for DNNs that are relaxations of the stable
set problem are presented. They show the impact of using the factorization of the dual variable in
order to improve the progress towards the optimal solution within an iteration of the ADMM. This
decreases the number of iterations as well as the CPU time to solve the DNN to a given precision. The
experiments also demonstrate that within a computationally cheap post-processing, we can compute
bounds that are close to the optimal value even if the DNN was solved to moderate precision only. This
makes ADMMs applicable also within a branch-and-bound algorithm.
