For a toric pair $(X, D)$, where $X$ is a projective toric variety of dimension $d-1\geq 1$ and $D$
is a very ample $T$-Cartier divisor, we show that the Hilbert-Kunz density function $HKd(X, D)(\lambda)$
is the $d-1$ dimensional volume of ${\overline {\mathcal P}}_D \cap \{z= \lambda\}$, where ${\overline
{\mathcal P}}_D\subset {\mathbb R}^d$ is a compact $d$-dimensional set (which is a finite union
of convex polytopes). We also show that, for $k\geq 1$, the function $HKd(X, kD)$ can be replaced
by another compactly supported continuous function $\varphi_{kD}$ which is `linear in $k$'. This
gives the formula for the associated coordinate ring $(R, {\bf m})$: $$\lim_{k\to \infty}\frac{e_{HK}(R,
{\bf m}^k) - e_0(R, {\bf m}^k)/d!}{k^{d-1}} = \frac{e_0(R, {\bf m})}{(d-1)!}\int_0^\infty\varphi_D(\lambda)d\lambda,
$$ where $\varphi_D$ (see Proposition~1.2) is solely determined by the shape of the polytope $P_D$,
associated to the toric pair $(X, D)$. Moreover $\varphi_D$ is a multiplicative function for Segre
products. This yields explicit computation of $\varphi_D$ (and hence the limit), for smooth Fano
toric surfaces with respect to anticanonical divisor. In general, due to this formulation in terms
of the polytope $P_D$, one can explicitly compute the limit for two dimensional toric pairs and their
Segre products. We further show that (Theorem~6.3) the renormailzed limit takes the minimum value
if and only if the polytope $P_D$ tiles the space $M_{\mathbb R} = {\mathbb R}^{d-1}$ (with the lattice
$M = {\mathbb Z}^{d-1}$). As a consequence, one gets an algebraic formulation of the tiling property
of any rational convex polytope.
