A proper subsemigroup of a semigroup is maximal if it is not contained in any other proper subsemigroup.
A maximal subsemigroup of a finite semigroup has one of a small number of forms, as described in a paper
of Graham, Graham, and Rhodes. Determining which of these forms arise in a given finite semigroup
is difficult, and no practical mechanism for doing so appears in the literature. We present an algorithm
for computing the maximal subsemigroups of a finite semigroup given knowledge of its Green's structure,
and the ability to determine maximal subgroups of certain subgroups. For a finite semigroup $S$
represented by a generating set $X$, in many examples, if it is practical to compute the Green's structure
of $S$ from $X$, then it is also practical to find the maximal subsemigroups of $S$ using the algorithm
we present. The generating set $X$ for $S$ may consist, for example, of transformations, or partial
permutations, of a finite set, or of matrices over a semiring. In such examples, the time taken to
determine the Green's structure of $S$ is comparable to that taken to find the maximal subsemigroups.
Certain aspects of the problem of finding maximal subsemigroups reduce to other well-known computational
problems, such as finding all maximal cliques in a graph and computing the maximal subgroups in a
group. The algorithm presented comprises two parts. One part relates to computing the maximal subsemigroups
of a special class of semigroups, known as Rees 0-matrix semigroups. The other part involves a careful
analysis of certain graphs associated to the semigroup $S$, which, roughly speaking, capture the
essential information about the action of $S$ on its $\mathscr{J}$-classes.
