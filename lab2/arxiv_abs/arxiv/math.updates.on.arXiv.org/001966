The theoretical basis for conventional acquisition of bandlimited signals typically relies on
uniform time sampling and assumes infinite-precision amplitude values. In this paper, we explore
signal representation and recovery based on uniform amplitude sampling with assumed infinite
precision timing information. The approach is based on the delta-ramp encoder which consists of
applying a one-level level-crossing detector to the result of adding an appropriate sawtooth-like
waveform to the input signal. The output samples are the time instants of these level crossings,
thus representing a time-encoded version of the input signal. For theoretical purposes, this system
can be equivalently analyzed by reversibly transforming through ramp addition a nonmonotonic
input signal into a monotonic one which is then uniformly sampled in amplitude. The monotonic function
is then represented by the times at which the signal crosses a predefined and equally-spaced set
of amplitude values. We refer to this technique as amplitude sampling. The time sequence generated
can be interpreted alternatively as nonuniform time sampling of the original source signal. We
derive duality and frequency-domain properties for the functions involved in the transformation.
Iterative algorithms are proposed and implemented for recovery of the original source signal.
As indicated in the simulations, the proposed iterative amplitude-sampling algorithm achieves
a faster convergence rate than frame-based reconstruction for nonuniform sampling. The performance
can also be improved by appropriate choice of the parameters while maintaining the same sampling
density.
