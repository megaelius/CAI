Extending R. A. Fisher and D. A. Freedman's results on the analysis of covariance, Lin [2013] proposed
an ordinary least squares adjusted estimator of the average treatment effect in completely randomized
experiments. His results are appealing because he uses Neyman's randomization model without imposing
any modeling assumptions, and the consistency and asymptotic normality of his estimator hold even
if the linear model is misspecified. His results hold for a fixed dimension $p$ of the covariates
with the sample size $n$ approaching infinity. However, it is common for practitioners to adjust
for a large number of covariates to improve efficiency. Therefore, it is important to consider asymptotic
regimes allowing for a diverging number of covariates. We show that Lin [2013]'s estimator is consistent
when $\kappa \log p \rightarrow 0$ and asymptotically normal when $\kappa p \rightarrow 0$ under
mild moment conditions, where $\kappa$ is the maximum leverage score of the covariate matrix. In
the favorable case where leverage scores are all close, his estimator is consistent when $p = o(n
/ \log n)$ and is asymptotically normal when $p = o(n^{1/2})$. In addition, we propose a bias-corrected
estimator that is consistent when $\kappa \log p\rightarrow 0$ and is asymptotically normal, with
the same variance in the fixed-$p$ regime, when $\kappa^{2} p \log p \rightarrow 0$. In the favorable
case, the latter condition reduces to $p = o(n^{2/3} / (\log n)^{1/3})$, and our simulation confirms
that $n^{2/3}$ is the phase-transition threshold for Lin [2013]'s central limit theorem. Our analysis
requires novel analytic tools for finite population inference and sampling without replacement,
which complement and potentially enrich the theory in other areas such as survey sampling, matrix
sketching, and transductive learning.
