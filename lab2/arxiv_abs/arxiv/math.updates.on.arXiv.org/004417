We consider the age of information in G/G/1/1 systems under two service discipline models. In the
first model, if a new update arrives when the service is busy, it is blocked; in the second model, a
new update preempts the current update in service. For the blocking model, we first derive an exact
age expression, then we propose two simple to calculate upper bounds for the average age. The first
upper bound assumes the interarrival times to have log-concave distribution. The second upper
bound assumes both the interarrivals and service times to have log-concave distribution. Both
upper bounds are tight in the case of M/M/1/1 systems. We show that deterministic interarrivals
and service times are optimum for the blocking service model. In addition, using the age expression
for G/G/1/1 systems, we calculate average age expressions for special cases, i.e., M/G/1/1 and
G/M/1/1 systems. Next, for the preemption in service model, we first derive an exact average age
expression for G/G/1/1 systems. Then, we propose a simple to calculate upper bound for the average
age. In addition, similar to blocking discipline, using the age expression for G/G/1/1 systems,
we calculate average age expressions for special cases, i.e., M/G/1/1 and G/M/1/1 systems. Average
age for G/M/1/1 can be written as a summation of two terms, the first of which depends only on the first
and second moments of interarrival times and the second of which depends only on the service rate.
In other words, interarrival and service times are decoupled. We show that deterministic interarrivals
are optimum for G/M/1/1 systems. On the other hand, we observe for non-exponential service times
that the optimal distribution of interarrival times depends on the relative values of the mean interarrival
time and the mean service time.
