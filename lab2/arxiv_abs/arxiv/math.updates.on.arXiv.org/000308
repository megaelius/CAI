We introduce techniques for defining and working with fundamental cycles on moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic
curves which are not necessarily cut out transversally. Such techniques have the potential for
applications as foundations for invariants in symplectic topology arising from "counting" $J$-holomorphic
curves. Our approach to virtual fundamental cycles is algebraic rather than geometric (in particular,
we do not use perturbation). We use sheaf-theoretic tools to give efficient proofs of the key properties
of the basic objects of our algebraic "VFC package". A byproduct of our algebraic approach is that
we need no smooth structure on the relevant transversely cut out "thickened moduli spaces". Our
methods are based on our notion of an implicit atlas on a moduli space (similar to a Kuranishi atlas
in the sense of McDuff-Wehrheim), which is (roughly) a convenient system of local finite-dimensional
reductions. We illustrate via specific examples a natural and intrinsic construction of implicit
atlases. Conditional on specific strong gluing theorems (in transverse settings), this construction
applies to rather general situations. We apply the tools we develop to construct Gromov-Witten
invariants and Hamiltonian Floer homology for general symplectic manifolds (though we omit proofs
of the necessary gluing statements). Our framework generalizes easily to construct $S^1$-equivariant
implicit atlases, and we use $S^1$-localization techniques in the context of implicit atlases
to calculate Hamiltonian Floer homology. The Arnold conjecture (as treated, in increasing generality,
by Floer, Hofer-Salamon, Ono, Liu-Tian, and Fukaya-Ono) is a well-known corollary of this calculation.
