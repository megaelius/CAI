Symmetry protected topological (SPT) states have boundary anomalies that obstruct the effective
boundary theory realized in its own dimension with UV completion and with an on-site $G$-symmetry.
In this work, yet we show that a certain anomalous non-on-site $G$ symmetry along the boundary becomes
on-site when viewed as a larger $H$ symmetry, via a suitable group extension $1\to K\to H\to G\to1$.
Namely, a non-perturbative global (gauge/gravitational) anomaly in $G$ becomes anomaly-free
in $H$. This guides us to construct exactly soluble lattice path integral and Hamiltonian of symmetric
gapped boundaries applicable to any SPT state of any finite symmetry group, including on-site unitary
and anti-unitary time-reversal symmetries. The resulting symmetric gapped boundary can be described
either by an $H$-symmetry extended boundary in any spacetime dimension, or more naturally by a topological
emergent $K$-gauge theory with a global symmetry $G$ on a 3+1D bulk or above. The excitations on such
a symmetric topologically ordered boundary can carry fractional quantum numbers of the symmetry
$G$, described by representations of $H$. (Apply our approach to a 1+1D boundary of 2+1D bulk, we
find that a deconfined gauge boundary indeed has spontaneous symmetry breaking with long-range
order. The deconfined symmetry-breaking phase crosses over smoothly to a confined phase without
a phase transition.) In contrast to known gapped boundaries/interfaces obtained via symmetry
breaking (either global symmetry breaking or Anderson-Higgs mechanism for gauge theory), our
approach is based on symmetry extension. More generally, applying our approach to SPT states, topologically
ordered gauge theories and symmetry enriched topologically ordered (SET) states, leads to generic
boundaries/interfaces constructed with a mixture of symmetry breaking, symmetry extension,
and dynamical gauging.
