We show that the classical homology theory of Steenrod may be enriched with descriptive set-theoretic
information. We prove that the resulting definable homology theory provides a strictly finer invariant
than Steenrod homology for compact metrizable spaces up to homotopy. In particular, we show that
pro-tori are completely classified up to homeomorphism by their definable homology. This is in
contrast with the fact that, for example, there exist uncountably many pairwise nonhomeomorphic
solenoids with the same Steenrod homology groups. We develop an analogous theory of definable cohomology
for locally compact second countable spaces, and we similarly prove that it is a strictly finer invariant
than \v{C}ech cohomology for locally compact second countable spaces. In particular, we show that
there exists an uncountable family of solenoid complements (complements of solenoids in the $3$-sphere)
that have the same \v{C}ech cohomology groups, and that are completely classified up to homotopy
equivalence and homeomorphism by their definable cohomology. We also apply definable cohomology
theory to the study of the space $\left[X,S^{2}\right] $ of homotopy classes of continuous functions
from a solenoid complement $X$ to the $2$-sphere, which was initiated by Borsuk and Eilenberg in
1936. It was proved by Eilenberg and Steenrod in 1940 that the space $\left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is uncountable.
We will strengthen this result, by showing that each orbit of the canonical action $\mathrm{Homeo}
\left( X\right) \curvearrowright \left[ X,S^{2}\right] $ is countable, and hence that such an
action has uncountably many orbits. This can be seen as a rigidity result, and will be deduced from
a rigidity result for definable automorphisms of the \v{C}ech cohomology of $X$. We will also show
that these results still hold if one replaces solenoids with pro-tori.
