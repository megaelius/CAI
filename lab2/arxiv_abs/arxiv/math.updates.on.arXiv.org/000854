We study the homotopy type of the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature on high-dimensional
compact spin manifolds. Hitchin used the fact that there are no harmonic spinors on a manifold with
positive scalar curvature to construct a secondary index map from the space of positive scalar metrics
to a suitable space from the real $K$-theory spectrum. Our main results concern the nontriviality
of this map. We prove that for $2n \geq 6$, the natural $KO$-orientation from the infinite loop space
of the Madsen--Tillmann--Weiss spectrum factors (up to homotopy) through the space of metrics
of positive scalar curvature on any $2n$-dimensional spin manifold. For manifolds of odd dimension
$2n+1 \geq 7$, we prove the existence of a similar factorisation. When combined with computational
methods from homotopy theory, these results have strong implications. For example, the secondary
index map is surjective on all rational homotopy groups. We also present more refined calculations
concerning integral homotopy groups. To prove our results we use three major sets of technical tools
and results. The first set of tools comes from Riemannian geometry: we use a parameterised version
of the Gromov--Lawson surgery technique which allows us to apply homotopy-theoretic techniques
to spaces of metrics of positive scalar curvature. Secondly, we relate Hitchin's secondary index
to several other index-theoretical results, such as the Atiyah--Singer family index theorem,
the additivity theorem for indices on noncompact manifolds and the spectral-flow index theorem.
Finally, we use the results and tools developed recently in the study of moduli spaces of manifolds
and cobordism categories. The key new ingredient we use in this paper is the high-dimensional analogue
of the Madsen--Weiss theorem, proven by Galatius and the third named author.
