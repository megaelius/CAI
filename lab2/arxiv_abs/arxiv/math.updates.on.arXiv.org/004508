When dynamical systems producing rhythmic behavior operate within hard limits, they may exhibit
limit cycles with sliding components, that is, closed isolated periodic orbits that make and break
contact with a constraint surface. Examples include heel-ground interaction in locomotion or
firing rate rectification in neural networks. In many rhythmic systems, robustness against external
perturbations involves response of both the shape and the timing of the limit cycle trajectory.
The existing methods of infinitesimal phase response curve (iPRC) and variational analysis are
well established for quantifying changes in timing and shape, respectively, for smooth systems.
These tools have recently been extended to nonsmooth dynamics with transversal crossing boundaries.
In this work, we further extend both methods to nonsmooth systems with sliding components, for both
instantaneous and parametric perturbations. We observe a new feature of the isochrons in a planar
limit cycle with hard sliding boundaries: a nonsmooth kink in the asymptotic phase function, originating
from the point at which the limit cycle smoothly departs the constraint surface, and propagating
away from the hard boundary into the interior of the domain. Moreover, the classical variational
analysis neglects timing information and is restricted to instantaneous perturbations. By defining
the `infinitesimal shape response curve" (iSRC), we incorporate timing sensitivity of an oscillator
to describe the shape response of this oscillator to parametric perturbations. In order to extract
timing information, we develop a `local timing response curve" that measures the timing sensitivity
of a limit cycle within any given region. We demonstrate in a specific example that taking into account
local timing sensitivity in a nonsmooth system greatly improves the accuracy of the iSRC over global
timing analysis given by the iPRC.
