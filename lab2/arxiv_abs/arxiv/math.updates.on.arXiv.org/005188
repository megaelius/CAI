We study for bounded multiplicative functions $f$ sums of the form \begin{align*} \sum_{\substack{n\leq
x \atop n\equiv a\pmod q}}f(n), \end{align*} establishing a theorem stating that their variance
over residue classes $a \pmod q$ is small as soon as $q=o(x)$, for almost all moduli $q$, with a nearly
power-saving exceptional set of $q$. This substantially improves on previous results of Hooley
on Barban-Davenport-Halberstam-type theorems for such $f$, and moreover our exceptional set
is essentially optimal unless one is able to make progress on certain well-known conjectures. We
are nevertheless able to prove stronger bounds for the number of the exceptional moduli $q$ in the
cases where $q$ is restricted to be either smooth or prime, and conditionally on GRH we show that our
variance estimate is valid for every $q$. These results are special cases of a "hybrid result" that
we establish that works for sums of $f(n)$ over almost all short intervals and arithmetic progressions
simultaneously, thus generalizing the Matom\"aki-Radziwill theorem on multiplicative functions
in short intervals. We also consider the maximal deviation of $f(n)$ over all residue classes $a\pmod
q$ in the square root range $q\leq x^{1/2-\varepsilon}$, and show that it is small for "smooth-supported"
$f$, again apart from a nearly power-saving set of exceptional $q$, thus providing a smaller exceptional
set than what follows from Bombieri-Vinogradov-type theorems. As an application of our methods,
we consider the analogue of Linnik's theorem on the least prime in an arithmetic progression for
products of exactly three primes, and prove the exponent $2+o(1)$ for this problem for all smooth
values of $q$.
