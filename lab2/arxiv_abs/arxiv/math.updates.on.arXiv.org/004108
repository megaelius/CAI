We consider inference about a scalar parameter under a non-parametric model based on a one-step
estimator computed as a plug in estimator plus the empirical mean of an estimator of the parameter's
influence function. We focus on a class of parameters that have influence function which depends
on two infinite dimensional nuisance functions and such that the bias of the one-step estimator
of the parameter of interest is the expectation of the product of the estimation errors of the two
nuisance functions. Our class includes many important treatment effect contrasts of interest
in causal inference and econometrics, such as ATE, ATT, an integrated causal contrast with a continuous
treatment, and the mean of an outcome missing not at random. We propose estimators of the target parameter
that entertain approximately sparse regression models for the nuisance functions allowing for
the number of potential confounders to be even larger than the sample size. By employing sample splitting,
cross-fitting and $\ell_1$-regularized regression estimators of the nuisance functions based
on objective functions whose directional derivatives agree with those of the parameter's influence
function, we obtain estimators of the target parameter with two desirable robustness properties:
(1) they are rate doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when
both nuisance functions follow approximately sparse models, even if one function has a very non-sparse
regression coefficient, so long as the other has a sufficiently sparse regression coefficient,
and (2) they are model doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal
even if one of the nuisance functions does not follow an approximately sparse model so long as the
other nuisance function follows an approximately sparse model with a sufficiently sparse regression
coefficient.
