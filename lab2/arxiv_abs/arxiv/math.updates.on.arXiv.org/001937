In this paper, we develop algorithms to overcome the curse of dimensionality in possibly non-convex
state-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations (HJ PDEs) arising from optimal control and differential
game problems. The subproblems are independent and can be implemented in an embarrassingly parallel
fashion. This is an ideal setup for perfect scaling in parallel computing. The algorithm is proposed
to overcome the curse of dimensionality [1, 2] when solving HJ PDE. The major contribution of the
paper is to change an optimization problem over a space of curves to an optimization problem of a single
vector, which goes beyond [23]. We extend [5, 6, 8], and conjecture a (Lax-type) minimization principle
when the Hamiltonian is convex, as well as a (Hopf-type) maximization principle when the Hamiltonian
is non-convex. The conjectured Hopf-type maximization principle is a generalization of the well-known
Hopf formula [11, 16, 30]. We validated formula under restricted assumptions, and bring our readers
to [57] which validates that our conjectures in a more general setting after a previous version of
our paper. We conjectured the weakest assumption is a psuedoconvexity assumption similar to [46].
The optimization problems are of the same dimension as that of the HJ PDE. We suggest a coordinate
descent method for the minimization procedure in the generalized Lax/Hopf formula, and numerical
differentiation is used to compute the derivatives. This method is preferable since the evaluation
of the function value itself requires some computational effort, especially when we handle high
dimensional optimization problem. The use of multiple initial guesses and a certificate of correctness
are suggested to overcome possibly multiple local extrema since the optimization process is no
longer convex. Our method is expected to have application in control theory and differential game
problems, and elsewhere.
