We develop an algorithm for the asymptotically fast evaluation of layer potentials close to and
on the source geometry, combining Geometric Global Accelerated QBX (`GIGAQBX') and target-specific
expansions. GIGAQBX is a fast high-order scheme for evaluation of layer potentials based on Quadrature
by Expansion (`QBX') using local expansions formed via the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). Target-specific
expansions serve to lower the cost of the formation and evaluation of QBX local expansions, reducing
the associated computational effort from $O((p+1)^{2})$ to $O(p+1)$ in three dimensions, without
any accuracy loss compared with conventional expansions, but with the loss of source/target separation
in the expansion coefficients. GIGAQBX is a `global' QBX scheme, meaning that the potential is mediated
entirely through expansions for points close to or on the boundary. In our scheme, this single global
expansion is decomposed into two parts that are evaluated separately: one part incorporating near-field
contributions using target-specific expansions, and one part using conventional spherical harmonic
expansions of far-field contributions, noting that convergence guarantees only exist for the
sum of the two sub-expansions. By contrast, target-specific expansions were originally introduced
as an acceleration mechanism for `local' QBX schemes, in which the far-field does not contribute
to the QBX expansion. Compared with the unmodified GIGAQBX algorithm, we show through a reproducible,
time-calibrated cost model that the combined scheme yields a considerable cost reduction for the
near-field evaluation part of the computation. We support the effectiveness of our scheme through
numerical results demonstrating performance improvements for Laplace and Helmholtz kernels.
