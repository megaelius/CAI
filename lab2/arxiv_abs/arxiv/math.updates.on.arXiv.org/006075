Although the spatially continuous version of the reaction-diffusion equation has been well studied,
in some instances a spatially-discretized representation provides a more realistic approximation
of biological processes. Indeed, mathematically the discretized and continuous systems can lead
to different predictions of biological dynamics. It is well known in the continuous case that the
incorporation of diffusion can cause diffusion-driven blow-up with respect to the $L^{\infty}$
norm. However, this does not imply diffusion-driven blow-up will occur in the discretized version
of the system. For example, in a continuous reaction-diffusion system with Dirichlet boundary
conditions and nonnegative solutions, diffusion-driven blow up occurs even when the total species
concentration is non-increasing. For systems that instead have homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions, it is currently unknown whether this deviation between the continuous and discretized
system can occur. Therefore, it is worth examining the discretized system independently of the
continuous system. Since no criteria exist for the boundedness of the discretized system, the focus
of this paper is to determine sufficient conditions to guarantee the system with diffusion remains
bounded for all time. We consider reaction-diffusion systems on a 1D domain with homogeneous Neumann
boundary conditions and non-negative initial data and solutions. We define a Lyapunov-like function
and show that its existence guarantees that the discretized reaction-diffusion system is bounded.
These results are considered in the context of three example systems for which Lyapunov-like functions
can and cannot be found.
