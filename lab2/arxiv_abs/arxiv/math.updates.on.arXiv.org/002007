An equation-by-equation (EBE) method is proposed to solve a system of nonlinear equations arising
from the moment constrained maximum entropy problem of multidimensional variables. The design
of the EBE method combines ideas from homotopy continuation and Newton's iterative methods. Theoretically,
we establish the local convergence under appropriate conditions and show that the proposed method,
geometrically, finds the solution by searching along the surface corresponding to one component
of the nonlinear problem. We will demonstrate the robustness of the method on various numerical
examples, including: (1) A six-moment one-dimensional entropy problem with an explicit solution
that contains components of order $10^0-10^3$ in magnitude; (2) Four-moment multidimensional
entropy problems with explicit solutions where the resulting systems to be solved ranging from
$70-310$ equations; (3) Four- to eight-moment of a two-dimensional entropy problem, which solutions
correspond to the densities of the two leading EOFs of the wind stress-driven large-scale oceanic
model. In this case, we find that the EBE method is more accurate compared to the classical Newton's
method, the MATLAB generic solver, and the previously developed BFGS-based method, which was also
tested on this problem. (4) Four-moment constrained of up to five-dimensional entropy problems
which solutions correspond to multidimensional densities of the components of the solutions of
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. For the higher dimensional cases of this example, the EBE method
is superior because it automatically selects a subset of the prescribed moment constraints from
which the maximum entropy solution can be estimated within the desired tolerance. This selection
feature is particularly important since the moment constrained maximum entropy problems do not
necessarily have solutions in general.
