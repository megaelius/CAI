We establish the equivalence of the Tuynman midpoint area formula for a spherical triangle to the
classical area formulas of Euler and of Cagnoli. The derivation also yields a variant of the Cagnoli
formula in terms of the medial triangle. We introduce the three barycentric coordinates of a point
within the spherical triangle as area ratios which sum to unity. The barycentric coordinates are
the Whitney 0-forms, scalar functions over the domain of the triangle associated with each vertex.
We then construct, by exterior differentiation of the barycentric coordinates, succinct expressions
for the Whitney 1-forms associated with each geodesic side, or great circle arc. The Euler formula,
in conjunction with that of Tuynman, facilitates the differentiation of a triangular area with
respect to the position of a vertex. As both the Euler and Tuynman formulas may be expressed naturally
in terms of the position vectors of the vertices on an embedded sphere, the Whitney constructions
may be done in terms of vector-valued forms and without recourse to a particular projection or coordinate
chart. Finally, we exhibit the Whitney 2-form of the triangle, which must be the product of a scalar
function and the area 2-form of the sphere. We find an expression for this scalar function in terms
of determinants of $3 \times 3$ matrices built from the vertex position vectors. It is a rational
function in the Cartesian coordinates of a point. By construction it must be invariant under cyclic
permutations of the three vertices, though it is not manifestly so. Also by construction the Whitney
2-form must integrate to one over the triangle. Thus the rational function is exactly integrable
over its triangle when restricted to the sphere.
