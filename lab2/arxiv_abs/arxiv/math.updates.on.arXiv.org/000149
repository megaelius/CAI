This note presents an elementary proof of Hilbert's 1891 Ansatz of nesting for $M$-sextics, along
the line of Riemann's Nachlass 1857 and a simple Harnack-style argument (1876). Our proof seems
to have escaped the attention of Hilbert (and all subsequent workers) [but alas turned out to contain
a severe gap, cf. Introduction for more!]. It uses a bit Poincar\'e's index formula (1881/85). The
method applies as well to prohibit Rohn's scheme 10/1, and therefore all obstructions of Hilbert's
16th in degree $m=6$ can be explained via the method of total reality. (The same ubiquity of the method
is conjectured in all degrees, and then suspected to offer new insights.) More factually, a very
simple and robust phenomenon of total reality on $M$-curves of even order is described (the odd-order
case being already settled in Gabard 2013), and it is speculated that this could be used as an attack
upon the (still open) Ragsdale conjecture for $M$-curves (positing that $| \chi|\le k^2$). Of course
a giant gap still remains to be bridged in case the latter conjecture is true at all. Alas, the writer
has little experimental evidence for the truth of the conjecture, and the game can be a hazardous
one. However we suspect that the method of total reality should at least be capable of recovering
the weaker Petrovskii bound, or strengthened variants due to Arnold 1971. This text has therefore
merely didactic character and offers no revolutionary results, but tries to reactivate a very ancient
method (due basically to Riemann 1857) whose swing seems to have been somewhat underestimated,
at least outside of the conformal-mapping community.
