Let $G$ be a reductive affine algebraic group defined over a field $k$ of characteristic zero. In
this paper, we study the cotangent complex of the derived $G$-representation scheme $ {\rm DRep}_G(X)$
of a pointed connected topological space $X$. We construct an (algebraic version of) unstable Adams
spectral sequence relating the cotangent homology of $ {\rm DRep}_G(X) $ to the representation
homology $ {\rm HR}_*(X,G) := \pi_*[{\rm DRep}_G(X)] $ and prove some vanishing theorems for groups
and geometrically interesting spaces. Our examples include virtually free groups, Riemann surfaces,
link complements in $ {\mathbb R}^3 $ and generalized lens spaces. In particular, for any f.g. virtually
free group $ \Gamma $, we show that $\, {\rm HR}_i({\rm B}\Gamma, G) = 0 \,$ for all $ i > 0 $. For a closed
Riemann surface $\Sigma_g $ of genus $ g \ge 1 $, we have $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for all $
i > \dim G $. The sharp vanishing bounds for $ \Sigma_g $ depend actually on the genus: we conjecture
that if $ g = 1 $, then $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for $ i > {\rm rank}\,G $, and if $ g \ge 2 $, then
$\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for $ i > \dim\,{\mathcal Z}(G) \,$, where $ {\mathcal Z}(G) $ is
the center of $G$. We prove these bounds locally on the smooth locus of the representation scheme
$ {\rm Rep}_G[\pi_1(\Sigma_g)]\,$ in the case of complex connected reductive groups. One important
consequence of our results is the existence of a well-defined $K$-theoretic virtual fundamental
class for $ {\rm DRep}_G(X)$ in the sense of Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov. We give a new `Tor formula'
for this class in terms of functor homology.
