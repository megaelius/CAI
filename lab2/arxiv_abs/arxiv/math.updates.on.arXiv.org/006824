Classical results of Milnor, Wood, Mather, and Thurston produce flat connections in surprising
places. The Milnor-Wood inequality is for circle bundles over surfaces, whereas the Mather-Thurston
Theorem is about cobording general manifold bundles to ones admitting a flat connection. The surprise
comes from the close encounter with obstructions from Chern-Weyl theory and other smooth obstructions
such as the Bott classes and the Godbillion-Vey invariant. Contradiction is avoided because the
structure groups for the positive results are larger than required by the obstructions, e.g.\ $\operatorname{PSL}(2,\R)$
versus $\operatorname{U}(1)$ in the former case and $C^1$ versus $C^2$ in the latter. This paper
adds two types of control strengthening the positive results: In many cases we are able to (1) refine
the Mather-Thurston cobordism to a semi-$s$-cobordism (ssc) and (2) provide detail about how,
and to what extent, transition functions must wander from an initial, small, structure group into
a larger one. The motivation is to lay mathematical foundations for a physical program. The philosophy
is that living in the IR we cannot expect to know, for a given bundle, if it has curvature or is flat,
because we can't resolve the fine scale topology which may be present in the base, introduced by a
ssc, nor minute symmetry violating distortions of the fiber. Small scale, UV, "distortions" of
the base topology and structure group allow flat connections to simulate curvature at larger scales.
The goal is to find a duality under which curvature terms, such as Maxwell's $F \wedge F^\ast$ and
Hilbert's $\int R\ dvol$ are replaced by an action which measures these "distortions." In this view,
curvature results from renormalizing a discrete, group theoretic, structure.
