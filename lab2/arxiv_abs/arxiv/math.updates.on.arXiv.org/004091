We develop a theory of right group-like projections in Hopf algebras linking them with the theory
of left coideal subalgebras with two sided counital integrals. Every right group-like projection
is associated with a left coideal subalgebra, maximal among the ones containing the given group-like
projection as an integral, and we show that that subalgebra is finite dimensional. We observe that
in a semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ every left coideal subalgebra has an integral and we prove a 1-1 correspondence
between right group-like projections and left coideal subalgebras of $H$. We provide a number of
equivalent conditions for a right group-like projections to be left group-like projection and
prove a 1-1 correspondence between semisimple left coideal subalgebras preserved by the squared
antipode and two sided group-like projections. We also classify left coideal subalgebras in Taft
Hopf algebras $H_{n^2}$ over a field $\mathbb{k}$, showing that the automorphism group splits
them into - a class of cardinality $|\mathbb{k}|-1$ of semisimple ones which correspond to right
group-like projections which are not two sided; - finitely many semisimple singletons, each corresponding
to two sided group-like projection; the number of those singletons for $H_{n^2}$ is equal to the
number of divisors of $n$; - finitely many singletons, each non-semisimple and admitting no right
group-like projection; the number of those singletons for $H_{n^2}$ is equal to the number of divisors
of $n$. In particular we answer the question of Landstad and Van Daele showing that there do exist
right group-like projections which are not left group-like projections.
