Real applications in structural mechanics, where the dynamic behavior is linear, are rare. Usually,
structures are made of components assembled together by means of joints whose behavior maybe highly
nonlinear. Depending on the amount of excitation, joints can dramatically change the dynamic behavior
of the whole system, and the modelling of this type of constraint is therefore crucial for a correct
prediction of the amount of vibration. The solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations by means
of the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) is widely accepted as an effective approach to calculate the
steady state forced response in the frequency domain, in spite of Direct Time Integration (DTI).
The state of the art contact element used to model the friction forces at the joint interfaces is a
nodal contact element, where the local contact compliance is modelled by means of linear springs
and Coulomb law is used to govern the friction phenomena. In the literature, when the HBM is applied
to vibrating systems with joint interfaces and the state-of-the-art contact model is used, an uncoupled
approach is mostly employed: the static governing equations are solved in advance to compute the
pre-stress effects and then the dynamic governing equations are solved to predict the vibration
amplitude of the system. As a result, the HBM steady-state solution may lead to a poor correlation
with the DTI solution, where static and dynamic loads are accounted for simultaneously. In this
paper, the HBM performances are investigated by comparing the uncoupled approach to a fully coupled
static/dynamic approach. In order to highlight the main differences between the two approaches,
a lumped parameter system, characterized by a single friction contact, is considered in order to
show the different levels of accuracy that the proposed approaches can provide for different configurations.
