We develop a spinor calculus for a $(2m+1)$-dimensional complex Riemannian manifold $(\mcM,g)$
equipped with a preferred holomorphic projective pure spinor field $[\xi]$. Such a spinor defines
a holomorphic distribution $\mcN$ of $m$-planes, totally null with respect to $g$. The stabiliser
of $[\xi]$ is a parabolic Lie subgroup $P$ of $\SO(2m+1,\C)$, and using its algebraic properties,
we give $P$-invariant classifications of the curvature tensors of the Levi-Civita connection,
which, in the case of the Weyl tensor, generalises the Petrov-Penrose classification to odd dimensions.
From a spinorial point of view, this generalises the notion of principal spinors. We also classify
the intrinsic torsion of $[\xi]$ in terms of $P$-irreducibles, which gives an algebraic measure
of the failure of $[\xi]$ to be parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. In particular,
we interpret the integrability properties of the associated null $m$-plane distribution $\mcN$
and its orthogonal complement $\mcN^\perp$ in terms of the algebraic types of the intrinsic torsion
of $[\xi]$. The conformal invariance of these classes are studied and we give curvature conditions
for a number of cases. We then investigate the geometric properties of a number of spinorial differential
equations. Notably, we relate the integrability properties of a null $m$-plane distribution to
the existence of solutions of odd-dimensional versions of the zero-rest-mass field equation.
We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a pure conformal Killing spinor to be foliating.
This leads in particular to a conjecture refining the author's odd-dimensional generalisation
of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem. This work can also be applied to a smooth real pseudo-Riemannian
manifold of split signature equipped with a preferred projective real pure spinor field.
