Third order tensors have wide applications in mechanics, physics and engineering. The most famous
and useful third order tensor is the piezoelectric tensor, which plays a key role in the piezoelectric
effect, first discovered by Curie brothers. On the other hand, the Levi-Civita tensor is famous
in tensor calculus. In this paper, we study third order tensors and (third order) hypermatrices
systematically, by regarding a third order tensor as a linear operator which transforms a second
order tensor into a first order tensor, or a first order tensor into a second order tensor. For a third
order tensor, we define its transpose, kernel tensor and L-eigenvalues. Here, "L" is named after
Levi-Civita. The transpose of a third order tensor is uniquely defined. In particular, the transpose
of the piezoelectric tensor is the inverse piezoelectric tensor (the electrostriction tensor).
The kernel tensor of a third order tensor is a second order positive semi-definite symmetric tensor,
which is the product of that third order tensor and its transpose. We define L-eigenvalues, singular
values, C-eigenvalues and Z-eigenvalues for a third order tensor. They are all invariants of that
third order tensor. For a third order partially symmetric tensor, we give its eigenvector decomposition.
The piezoelectric tensor, the inverse piezoelectric tensor, and third order symmetric tensors
are third order partially symmetric tensors. We show that a third order partially symmetric tensor
has at most twelve independent invariants and make a conjecture a third order symmetric tensor has
seven independent invariants. We raise the questions on how may independent invariants a third
order tensor, a third order partially symmetric tensor and a third order cyclically symmetric tensor
may have respectively.
