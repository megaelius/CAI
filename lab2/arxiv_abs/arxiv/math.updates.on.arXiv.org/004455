In addition to their lower emissions and fast ramping capabilities, gas-fired electric power generation
is increasing due to newly discovered supplies and declining prices. The vast infrastructure development,
gas flow dynamics, and complex interdependence of gas with electric power networks call for advanced
computational tools. Solving the equations relating gas injections to pressures and pipeline
flows lies at the heart of natural gas network (NGN) operation, yet existing solvers require careful
initialization and uniqueness has been an open question. In this context, this work considers the
nonlinear steady-state version of the gas flow (GF) problem. It first establishes that the solution
to the GF problem is unique under arbitrary gas network topologies, compressor types, and sets of
specifications. For GF setups where pressure is specified on a single (reference) node and compressors
do no appear in cycles, the GF task is posed as an convex minimization. To handle more general setups,
a GF solver relying on a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MI-QCQP)
is also devised. This solver can be used for any GF setup and any network. It introduces binary variables
to capture flow directions; relaxes the pressure drop equations to quadratic inequality constraints;
and uses a carefully selected objective to promote the exactness of this relaxation. The relaxation
is provably exact in networks with non-overlapping cycles and a single fixed-pressure node. The
solver handles efficiently the involved bilinear terms through McCormick linearization. Numerical
tests validate our claims, demonstrate that the MI-QCQP solver scales well, and that the relaxation
is exact even when the sufficient conditions are violated, such as in networks with overlapping
cycles and multiple fixed-pressure nodes.
