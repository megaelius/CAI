Following Anders and Archer, we say that an unordered rooted labeled forest avoids the pattern $\sigma\in\mathcal{S}_k$
if in each tree, each sequence of labels along the shortest path from the root to a vertex does not contain
a subsequence with the same relative order as $\sigma$. For each permutation $\sigma\in\mathcal{S}_{k-2}$,
we construct a bijection between $n$-vertex forests avoiding $(\sigma)(k-1)k=\sigma(1)\cdots\sigma(k-2)(k-1)k$
and $n$-vertex forests avoiding $(\sigma)k(k-1)=\sigma(1)\cdots\sigma(k-2)k(k-1)$, giving
a common generalization of results of West on permutations and Anders--Archer on forests. We further
define a new object, the forest-Young diagram, which we use to extend the notion of shape-Wilf equivalence
to forests. In particular, this allows us to generalize the above result to a bijection between forests
avoiding $\{(\sigma_1)k(k-1), (\sigma_2)k(k-1), \dots, (\sigma_\ell) k(k-1)\}$ and forests
avoiding $\{(\sigma_1)(k-1)k, (\sigma_2)(k-1)k, \dots, (\sigma_\ell) (k-1)k\}$ for $\sigma_1,
\dots, \sigma_\ell \in \mathcal{S}_{k-2}$. Furthermore, we give recurrences enumerating the
forests avoiding $\{123\cdots k\}$, $\{213\}$, and other sets of patterns. Finally, we extend
the Goulden--Jackson cluster method to study consecutive pattern avoidance in rooted trees as
defined by Anders and Archer. Using the generalized cluster method, we prove that if two length-$k$
patterns are strong-c-forest-Wilf equivalent, then up to complementation, the two patterns must
start with the same number. We also prove the surprising result that the patterns $1324$ and $1423$
are strong-c-forest-Wilf equivalent, even though they are not c-Wilf equivalent with respect
to permutations.
