In recent work, Cuntz, Deninger and Laca have studied the Toeplitz type C*-algebra associated to
the affine monoid of algebraic integers in a number field, under a time evolution determined by the
absolute norm. The KMS equilibrium states of their system are parametrized by traces on the C*-algebras
of the semidirect products $J \rtimes O^*$ resulting from the multiplicative action of the units
$O^*$ on integral ideals $J$ representing each ideal class. At each fixed inverse temperature $\beta
> 2$, the extremal equilibrium states correspond to extremal traces of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$. Here
we undertake the study of these traces using the transposed action of $O^*$ on the duals $\hat J$ of
the ideals and the recent characterization of traces on transformation group C*-algebras due to
Neshveyev. We show that the extremal traces of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$ are parametrized by pairs consisting
of an ergodic invariant measure for the action of $O^*$ on $\hat{J}$ together with a character of
the isotropy subgroup associated to the support of this measure. For every ideal the dual group $\hat
{J}$ is a d-torus on which $O^*$ acts by linear toral automorphisms. Hence, the problem of classifying
all extremal traces is a generalized version of Furstenberg's celebrated $\times 2$ $\times 3$
conjecture. We classify the results for various number fields in terms of ideal class group, degree,
and unit rank, and we point along the way the trivial, the intractable, and the conjecturally classifiable
cases. At the topological level, it is possible to characterize the number fields for which infinite
$O^*$-invariant sets are dense in $\hat{J} $, thanks to a theorem of Berend; as an application we
give a description of the primitive ideal space of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$ for those number fields.
