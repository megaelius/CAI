In this paper, downlink transmission scheduling of popular files is optimized with the assistance
of wireless cache nodes. Specifically, the requests of each file, which is further divided into
a number of segments, are modeled as a Poisson point process within its finite lifetime. Two downlink
transmission modes are considered: (1) the base station reactively multicasts the file segments
to the requesting users and selected cache nodes; (2) the base station proactively multicasts some
file segments to the selected cache nodes without requests. The cache nodes with decoded file segments
can help to offload the traffic via other spectrum. Without the proactive multicast, we formulate
the downlink transmission resource minimization as a dynamic programming problem with random
stage number, which can be approximated via a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with
fixed stage number. To address the prohibitively huge state space, we propose a low-complexity
scheduling policy by linearly approximating the value functions of the MDP, where the bound on the
approximation error is derived. Moreover, we propose a learning-based algorithm to evaluate the
approximated value functions for unknown geographical distribution of requesting users. Finally,
given the above reactive multicast policy, a proactive multicast policy is introduced to exploit
the temporal diversity of shadowing effect. It is shown by simulation that the proposed low-complexity
reactive multicast policy can significantly reduce the resource consumption at the base station,
and the proactive multicast policy can further improve the performance.
