The performance of cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is limited by the finite capacities of the
backhaul links connecting the centralized processor (CP) with the base-stations (BSs), especially
when the backhaul is implemented in a wireless medium. This paper proposes the use of wireless multicast
together with BS caching, where the BSs pre-store contents of popular files, to augment the backhaul
of C-RAN. For a downlink C-RAN consisting of a single cluster of BSs and wireless backhaul, this paper
studies the optimal cache size allocation strategy among the BSs and the optimal multicast beamforming
transmission strategy at the CP such that the user's requested messages are delivered from the CP
to the BSs in the most efficient way. We first state a multicast backhaul rate expression based on
a joint cache-channel coding scheme, which implies that larger cache sizes should be allocated
to the BSs with weaker channels. We then formulate a two-timescale joint cache size allocation and
beamforming design problem, where the cache is optimized offline based on the long-term channel
statistical information, while the beamformer is designed during the file delivery phase based
on the instantaneous channel state information. By leveraging the sample approximation method
and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we develop efficient algorithms for
optimizing cache size allocation among the BSs, and quantify how much more cache should be allocated
to the weaker BSs. We further consider the case with multiple files having different popularities
and show that it is in general not optimal to entirely cache the most popular files first. Numerical
results show considerable performance improvement of the optimized cache size allocation scheme
over the uniform allocation and other heuristic schemes.
