The measurement process is considered for quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. Measurements
are carried out on one QFT, the "system", using another, the "probe" via a dynamical coupling of "system"
and "probe" in a bounded spacetime region. The resulting "coupled theory" determines a scattering
map on the uncoupled combination of the "system" and "probe" by reference to natural "in" and "out"
spacetime regions. No specific interaction is assumed and all constructions are local and covariant.
Given any initial probe state in the "in" region, the scattering map determines a completely positive
map from "probe" observables in the "out" region to "induced system observables", thus providing
a measurement scheme for the latter. It is shown that the induced system observables may be localized
in the causal hull of the interaction coupling region and are typically less sharp than the probe
observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory. Post-selected states
conditioned on measurement outcomes are obtained using Davies-Lewis instruments. Composite
measurements involving causally ordered coupling regions are also considered. Provided that
the scattering map obeys a causal factorization property, the causally ordered composition of
the individual instruments coincides with the composite instrument; in particular, the instruments
may be combined in either order if the coupling regions are causally disjoint. This is the central
consistency property of the proposed framework. The general concepts and results are illustrated
by an example in which both "system" and "probe" are quantized linear scalar fields, coupled by a
quadratic interaction term with compact spacetime support. System observables induced by simple
probe observables are calculated exactly, for sufficiently weak coupling, and compared with first
order perturbation theory.
