The goal of this paper is to provide a selection principle for potential mean field games on a finite
state space and, in this respect, to show that equilibria that do not minimize the corresponding
mean field control problem should be ruled out. Our strategy is a tailored-made version of the vanishing
viscosity method for partial differential equations. Here, the viscosity has to be understood
as the square intensity of a common noise that is inserted in the mean field game or, equivalently,
as the diffusivity parameter in the related parabolic version of the master equation. As established
recently, the randomly forced mean field game becomes indeed uniquely solvable for a relevant choice
of a Wright-Fisher common noise, the counterpart of which in the master equation is a Kimura operator
on the simplex. We here elaborate on this idea to make the mean field game with common noise both uniquely
solvable and potential, meaning that its unique solution is in fact equal to the unique minimizer
of a suitable stochastic mean field control problem. Taking the limit as the intensity of the common
noise vanishes, we obtain a rigorous proof of the aforementioned selection principle. As a byproduct,
we get that the classical solution to the viscous master equation associated with the mean field
game with common noise converges to the gradient of the value function of the mean field control problem
without common noise; we hence select a particular weak solution of the master equation of the original
mean field game. Lastly, we establish an intrinsic uniqueness criterion for this solution within
a suitable class.
