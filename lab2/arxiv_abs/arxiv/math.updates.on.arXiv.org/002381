We introduce a novel algorithm for nonlinear processing of data gathered by an active array of sensors
which probes a medium with pulses and measures the resulting waves. The algorithm is motivated by
the application of array imaging. We describe it for a generic hyperbolic system that applies to
acoustic, electromagnetic or elastic waves in a scattering medium modeled by an unknown coefficient
called the reflectivity. The goal of imaging is to invert the nonlinear mapping from the reflectivity
to the array data. Many existing imaging methodologies ignore the nonlinearity i.e., operate under
the assumption that the Born (single scattering) approximation is accurate. This leads to image
artifacts when multiple scattering is significant. Our algorithm seeks to transform the array
data to those corresponding to the Born approximation, so it can be used as a pre-processing step
for any linear inversion method. The nonlinear data transformation algorithm is based on a reduced
order model defined by a proxy wave propagator operator that has four important properties. First,
it is data driven, meaning that it is constructed from the data alone, with no knowledge of the medium.
Second, it can be factorized in two operators that have an approximately affine dependence on the
unknown reflectivity. This allows the computation of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the reflectivity
to the data mapping which gives the Born approximation. Third, the algorithm involves regularization
which balances numerical stability and data fitting with accuracy of the order of the standard deviation
of additive data noise. Fourth, the algebraic nature of the algorithm makes it applicable to scalar
(acoustic) and vectorial (elastic, electromagnetic) wave data without any specific modifications.
