This work considers online optimal motion planning of an autonomous agent subject to linear temporal
logic (LTL) constraints. The environment is dynamic in the sense of containing mobile obstacles
and time-varying areas of interest (i.e., time-varying reward and workspace properties) to be
visited by the agent. Since user-specified tasks may not be fully realized (i.e., partially infeasible),
this work considers hard and soft LTL constraints, where hard constraints enforce safety requirement
(e.g. avoid obstacles) while soft constraints represent tasks that can be relaxed to not strictly
follow user specifications. The motion planning of the agent is to generate policies, in decreasing
order of priority, to 1) formally guarantee the satisfaction of safety constraints; 2) mostly satisfy
soft constraints (i.e., minimize the violation cost if desired tasks are partially infeasible);
and 3) optimize the objective of rewards collection (i.e., visiting dynamic areas of more interests).
To achieve these objectives, a relaxed product automaton, which allows the agent to not strictly
follow the desired LTL constraints, is constructed. A utility function is developed to quantify
the differences between the revised and the desired motion plan, and the accumulated rewards are
designed to bias the motion plan towards those areas of more interests. Receding horizon control
is synthesized with an LTL formula to maximize the accumulated utilities over a finite horizon,
while ensuring that safety constraints are fully satisfied and soft constraints are mostly satisfied.
Simulation and experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed
motion strategy.
