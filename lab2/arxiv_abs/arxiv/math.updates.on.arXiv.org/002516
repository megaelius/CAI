A function $\kappa$-transformation $w\left( z \right)\to \widetilde{w}\left( z \right)=w\left(
z \right)\left( 1+\kappa \left( z \right) \right)$ is constructed with the initial condition $\kappa
\left( {{z}_{0}} \right)=0$ at the point $z_{ 0} \in \Omega$ and a more general $K$-transformation
$w\left( z \right)\to \widetilde{w}\left( z \right)=w\left( z \right)K\left( z \right)$ that
is also made to rediscuss the complex differentiability for a given complex function $w$ and subsequently
we obtain a certain continuity and differentiability new criteria-nonlinear $K \left( z \right)$-structural
Cauchy-Riemann equations to judge a complex function to be complex structural differentiable,
namely, $K$-structural holomorphic condition in $\mathbb {C}$ or $\mathbb {C}^{n}$ respectively.
Then we found an unique Carleman-Bers-Vekua equations which is more simpler that all coefficients
are dependent to the structural function $\kappa \left( z \right)$ or $K \left( z \right)$. The generalized
$K\left( z \right)$-exterior differential operator and the generalized structural Wirtinger
derivatives are simultaneously obtained as well. Nonlinear $K\left( z \right)$-structural Laplace
equation is studied in the form of a second-order partial differential equation. In this framework
of $K\left( z \right)$-structural function, we surprisely discover that structural function
$K\left( z \right)$ is innately dependent to the complex domain or complex manifold themself, and
the Cauchy-Riemann equation or nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation or Carleman-Bers-Vekua equations
can be unified and expressed in a simple and compact differential form-$K\left( z \right)$-structural
holomorphic differential equation, since $K\left( z \right)$ can be chosen arbitrarily, thus
it has greatly generalized the applied practicability what we study.
