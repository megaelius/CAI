Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication and network densification hold great promise for achieving
high-rate communication in next-generation wireless networks. Cloud radio access network (CRAN),
in which low-complexity remote radio heads (RRHs) coordinated by a central unit (CU) are deployed
to serve users in a distributed manner, is a cost-effective solution to achieve network densification.
However, when operating over a large bandwidth in the mmWave frequencies, the digital fronthaul
links in a CRAN would be easily saturated by the large amount of sampled and quantized signals to be
transferred between RRHs and the CU. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new architecture
for mmWave-based CRAN with advanced lens antenna arrays at the RRHs. Due to the energy focusing property,
lens antenna arrays are effective in exploiting the angular sparsity of mmWave channels, and thus
help in substantially reducing the fronthaul rate and simplifying the signal processing at the
multi-antenna RRHs and the CU, even when the channels are frequency-selective. We consider the
uplink transmission in a mmWave CRAN with lens antenna arrays and propose a low-complexity quantization
bit allocation scheme for multiple antennas at each RRH to meet the given fronthaul rate constraint.
Further, we propose a channel estimation technique that exploits the energy focusing property
of the lens array and can be implemented at the CU with low complexity. Finally, we compare the proposed
mmWave CRAN using lens antenna arrays with a conventional CRAN using uniform planar arrays at the
RRHs, and show that the proposed design achieves significant throughput gains, yet with much lower
complexity.
