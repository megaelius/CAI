We prove that the dihedral Lie coalgebra $\D:={\oplus}_{k\geq m \geq 1} D_{m,k}$ corresponding
to $\DGH$ of \cite{Gon1} for $G=\{e\}$ (also denoted by $\D(G)$ in \cite{Gon}) is the bigraded dual
of the linearized double shuffle Lie algebra $\ls:={\oplus}_{k\geq m \geq 1}\ls_m^k\subset \mathbb{Q}\langle
x,z \rangle$ of \cite{Brown} whose Lie bracket is the Ihara bracket initially defined over $\mathbb{Q}\langle
x,z \rangle$. This by constructing an explicit isomorphism $\D \to \ls^\vee$, where $\ls^\vee$
is the Lie coalgebra dual (in the bigraded sense) to $\ls$. The work leads to a new proof of the fact
that $\ls$ is preserved by the Ihara bracket. We also prove folklore results from \cite{Brown} and
\cite{IKZ} (that apparently have no written proofs in the literature) stating that (for $k \geq
m \geq 2$) the linear map $f_m: \mathbb{Q}\langle x,z \rangle_m \to \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\dots,x_m]$
($\mathbb{Q}\langle x,z \rangle_m$ is the space linearly generated by monomials of $\mathbb{Q}\langle
x,z \rangle$ of degree $m$ with respect to $z$) given by $x^{n_1}z\cdots x^{n_m}z\mapsto x_1^{n_1}\cdots
x_{n_m}^{n_m}$ and $x^{n_1}z\cdots x^{n_m}zx^{n_{m+1}+1}\mapsto 0$ for $n_1,\dots,n_{m+1}\in
\N$, maps $\ls_m^k$ isomorphically to the double shuffle space $\mathrm{Dsh}_{m}({{k}-m})\subset
\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\dots,x_m]$ of \cite{IKZ} (stated in \cite{Brown}) and that $D_{m,k}$ is isomorphic
to $\mathrm{Dsh}_{m}({{k}-m})$ (stated in \cite{IKZ}). Here, we give an explicit isomorphism
between $D_{m,k}$ and the dual space $\mathrm{Dsh}_{m}({{k}-m})^\vee$ of $\mathrm{Dsh}_{m}({{k}-m})$
and we show the statement concerning $f_m$. In fact, we have three explicit compatible isomorphisms
$\D \to \ls^\vee, D_{m,k}\to \Dsh_m^\vee(k-m)$ and $\bar{f}_m:\ls_m^k \to \Dsh_m(k-m)$, where
$\bar{f}_m$ is the restriction of $f_m$.
