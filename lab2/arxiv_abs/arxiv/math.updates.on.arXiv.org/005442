We analyze the long term behavior of interacting populations which can be controlled through harvesting.
The dynamics is assumed to be discrete in time and stochastic due to the effect of environmental fluctuations.
We present extinction and coexistence criteria when there are one or two interacting species. We
then use these tools in order to see when harvesting leads to extinction or persistence of species,
as well as what the optimal harvesting strategies, which maximize the expected long term yield,
look like. For single species systems, we show under certain conditions that the optimal harvesting
strategy is of bang-bang type: there is a threshold under which there is no harvesting, while everything
above this threshold gets harvested. The second part of the paper is concerned with the analysis
of ecosystems that have two interacting species which can be harvested. In particular, we carefully
study predator-prey and competitive Ricker models when there are two species. In this setting we
show how to find the optimal proportional harvesting strategy. If the system is of predator-prey
type the optimal proportional harvesting strategy is, depending on the interaction parameters
and the price of predators relative to prey, either to harvest the predator to extinction and maximize
the asymptotic yield of the prey or to not harvest the prey and to maximize the asymptotic harvesting
yield of the predators. If the system is competitive, in certain instances it is optimal to drive
one species extinct and to harvest the other one. In other cases it is best to let the two species coexist
and harvest both species while maintaining coexistence. In the setting of the competitive Ricker
model we show that if one competitor is dominant and pushes the other species to extinction, the harvesting
of the dominant species can lead to coexistence.
