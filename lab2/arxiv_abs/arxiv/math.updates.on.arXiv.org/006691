Previously, we developed the technique of balayage of measures or charges and ($\delta$-)subharmonic
functions of finite order onto an closed system of rays $S$ with a vertex at zero on the complex plane
$\mathbb C$. In this article, we use only two kinds of balayage of measure and charge, as well as of
subharmonic functions of finite type under the order $1$ and their differences. First, it is a classical
balayage of the genus $q=0$ on a system of four closed rays: positive and negative, and real and imaginary
semi-axis $\mathbb R^+$, $-\mathbb R^+$, $i\mathbb R^+$, $-i\mathbb R$. Second, it is two-sided
balayage of genus $q=1$ from the open right and left half-planes $\mathbb C_{{\rm rh}}$ and $\mathbb
C_{{\rm lh}}$ onto the imaginary axis $i\mathbb R$. The classical Malliavin-Rubel theorem gives
necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of an entire function of exponential type
(we write e.f.e.t.) $f\not\equiv 0$, vanishing on the given positive sequence ${\sf Z}=\{{\sf
z}_k\}_{k\in \mathbb N}\subset \mathbb R^+$ and satisfying the constraint $|f|\leq |g|$ on $i\mathbb
R$, where $g$ is an e.f.e.t., vanishing on positive sequence ${\sf W}=\{{\sf w}_k\}_{k\in \mathbb
N}\subset \mathbb R^+$. A combination of these special balayage processes of genus $q=0$ and $q=1$
allows us to extend the Malliavin-Rubel theorem to arbitrary complex sequences ${\sf Z}=\{{\sf
z}_k\}_{k\in \mathbb N}\subset \mathbb C$ separated by a pair of vertical angles from the imaginary
axis $i\mathbb R$, with much more general restrictions $\ln |f|\leq M$ on the imaginary axis $i\mathbb
R$, where $M$ is an subharmonic function of finite type under the order $1$.
