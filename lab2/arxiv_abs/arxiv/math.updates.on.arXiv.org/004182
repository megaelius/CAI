Given the efficiency and equity concerns of a cordon toll, this paper proposes a few alternative
distance-dependent area-based pricing models for a large-scale dynamic traffic network. We use
the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) to monitor the network traffic state over time and consider
different trip lengths in the toll calculation. The first model is a distance toll that is linearly
related to the distance traveled within the cordon. The second model is an improved joint distance
and time toll (JDTT) whereby users are charged jointly in proportion to the distance traveled and
time spent within the cordon. The third model is a further improved joint distance and delay toll
(JDDT) which replaces the time toll in the JDTT with a delay toll component. To solve the optimal toll
level problem, we develop a simulation-based optimization (SBO) framework. Specifically, we
propose a simultaneous approach and a sequential approach, respectively, based on the proportional-integral
(PI) feedback controller to iteratively adjust the JDTT and JDDT, and use a calibrated large-scale
simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model of Melbourne, Australia to evaluate
the network performance under different pricing scenarios. While the framework is developed for
static pricing, we show that it can be easily extended to solve time-dependent pricing by using multiple
PI controllers. Results show that although the distance toll keeps the network from entering the
congested regime of the NFD, it naturally drives users into the shortest paths within the cordon
resulting in an uneven distribution of congestion. This is reflected by a large clockwise hysteresis
loop in the NFD. In contrast, both the JDTT and JDDT reduce the size of the hysteresis loop while achieving
the same control objective.
