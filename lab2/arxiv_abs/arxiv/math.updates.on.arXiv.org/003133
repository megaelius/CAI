We analyze the optimal harvesting problem for an ecosystem of species that experience environmental
stochasticity. Our work generalizes the current literature significantly by taking into account
non-linear interactions between species, state-dependent prices, and species injections. The
key generalization is making it possible to not only harvest, but also `seed' individuals into the
ecosystem. This is motivated by how fisheries and certain endangered species are controlled. The
harvesting problem becomes finding the optimal harvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the
expected total income from the harvest minus the lost income from the species injections. Our analysis
shows that new phenomena emerge due to the possibility of species injections. It is well-known that
multidimensional harvesting problems are very hard to tackle. We are able to make progress, by characterizing
the value function as a viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations.
Moreover, we provide a verification theorem, which tells us that if a function has certain properties,
then it will be the value function. This allows us to show heuristically, as was shown in Lungu and
$\O$ksendal (Bernoulli '01), that it is almost surely never optimal to harvest or seed from more
than one population at a time. We approximate the continuous-time systems by Markov chains and show
that the optimal harvesting-seeding strategies of the Markov chain approximations converge to
the correct optimal harvesting strategy. This is used to provide numerical approximations to the
optimal harvesting-seeding strategies and is a first step towards a full understanding of the intricacies
of how one should harvest and seed interacting species. In particular, we look at three examples:
one species modeled by a Verhulst-Pearl diffusion, two competing species and a two-species predator-prey
system.
