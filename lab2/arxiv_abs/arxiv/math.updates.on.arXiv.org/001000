Massive MIMO is a variant of multiuser MIMO, where the number of antennas $M$ at the base-station
is large, and generally much larger than the number of spatially multiplexed data streams to/from
the users. It has been observed that in many realistic propagation scenarios as well as in spatially
correlated channel models used in standardizations, although the user channel vectors have a very
high-dim $M$, they lie on low-dim subspaces due to their limited angular spread. This low-dim subspace
structure remains stable across many coherence blocks and can be exploited in several ways to improve
the system performance. A main challenge, however, is to estimate this signal subspace from samples
of users' channel vectors as fast and efficiently as possible. In a recent work, we addressed this
problem and proposed a very effective novel algorithm referred to as Approximate Maximum-Likelihood
(AML), which was formulated as a semi-definite program (SDP). In this paper, we address two problems
left open in our previous work: computational complexity and tracking. The algorithm proposed
in this paper is reminiscent of Multiple Measurement Vectors (MMV) problem in Compressed Sensing
and is proved to be equivalent to the AML Algorithm for sufficiently dense angular grids. It has also
a very low computational complexity and is able to track sharp transitions in the channel statistics
very quickly. Although mainly motivated by massive MIMO applications, our proposed algorithm
is of independent interest in other related subspace estimation applications. We assess the estimation/tracking
performance of our proposed algorithm empirically via numerical simulations, especially in practically
relevant situations where a direct implementation of the SDP would be infeasible in real-time.
We also compare the performance of our algorithm with other related subspace estimation algorithms
in the literature.
