For the two-user MISO broadcast channel with imperfect and delayed channel state information at
the transmitter (CSIT), the work explores the tradeoff between performance on the one hand, and
CSIT timeliness and accuracy on the other hand. The work considers a broad setting where communication
takes place in the presence of a random fading process, and in the presence of a feedback process that,
at any point in time, may provide CSIT estimates - of some arbitrary accuracy - for any past, current
or future channel realization. This feedback quality may fluctuate in time across all ranges of
CSIT accuracy and timeliness, ranging from perfectly accurate and instantaneously available
estimates, to delayed estimates of minimal accuracy. Under standard assumptions, the work derives
the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region, which is tight for a large range of CSIT quality. This derived
DoF region concisely captures the effect of channel correlations, the accuracy of predicted, current,
and delayed-CSIT, and generally captures the effect of the quality of CSIT offered at any time, about
any channel. The work also introduces novel schemes which - in the context of imperfect and delayed
CSIT - employ encoding and decoding with a phase-Markov structure. The results hold for a large class
of block and non-block fading channel models, and they unify and extend many prior attempts to capture
the effect of imperfect and delayed feedback. This generality also allows for consideration of
novel pertinent settings, such as the new periodically evolving feedback setting, where a gradual
accumulation of feedback bits progressively improves CSIT as time progresses across a finite coherence
period.
