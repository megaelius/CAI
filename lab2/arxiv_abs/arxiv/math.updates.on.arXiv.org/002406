The Langlands functoriality conjecture, as reformulated in the "beyond endoscopy" program, predicts
comparisons between the (stable) trace formulas of different groups $G_1, G_2$ for every morphism
${^LG}_1\to {^LG}_2$ between their $L$-groups. This conjecture can be seen as a special case of
a more general conjecture, which replaces reductive groups by spherical varieties and the trace
formula by its generalization, the relative trace formula. The goal of this article and its continuation
is to demonstrate, by example, the existence of "transfer operators" betweeen relative trace formulas,
that generalize the scalar transfer factors of endoscopy. These transfer operators have all properties
that one could expect from a trace formula comparison: matching, fundamental lemma for the Hecke
algebra, transfer of (relative) characters. Most importantly, and quite surprisingly, they appear
to be of abelian nature (at least, in the low-rank examples considered in this paper), even though
they encompass functoriality relations of non-abelian harmonic analysis. Thus, they are amenable
to application of the Poisson summation formula in order to perform the global comparison. Moreover,
we show that these abelian transforms have some structure --- which presently escapes our understanding
in its entirety --- as deformations of well-understood operators when the spaces under consideration
are replaced by their "asymptotic cones". In this first paper we study (relative) characters for
the Kunzetsov formula and the stable trace formula for $\operatorname{SL}_2$ and their degenerations
(as well as for the relative trace formula for torus periods in $\operatorname{PGL}_2$), and we
show how they correspond to each other under explicit transfer operators.
