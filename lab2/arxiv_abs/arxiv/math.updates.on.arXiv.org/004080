Graham-Pollak showed that for $D = D_T$ the distance matrix of a tree $T$, det$(D)$ depends only on
its number of edges. Several other variants of $D$, including directed/multiplicative/$q$- versions
were studied, and always, det$(D)$ depends only on the edge-data. We introduce a general framework
for bi-directed weighted trees, with threefold significance. First, we improve on state-of-the-art
for all known variants, even in the classical Graham-Pollak case: we delete arbitrary pendant nodes
(and more general subsets) from the rows/columns of $D$, and show these minors do not depend on the
tree-structure. Second, our setting unifies all known variants (with entries in a commutative
ring). We further compute in closed form the inverse of $D$, extending a result of Graham-Lovasz
[Adv. Math. 1978] and answering a question of Bapat-Lal-Pati [Lin. Alg. Appl. 2006]. Third, we compute
a second function of the matrix $D$: the sum of all its cofactors, cof$(D)$. This was worked out in
the simplest setting by Graham-Hoffman-Hosoya (1978), but is relatively unexplored for other
variants. We prove a stronger result, in our general setting, by computing cof$(.)$ for minors as
above, and showing these too depend only on the edge-data. Finally, we show our setting is the 'most
general possible', in that with more freedom in the edgeweights, det$(D)$ and cof$(D)$ depend on
the tree structure. In a sense, this completes the study of the invariant det$(D_T)$ (and cof$(D_T)$)
for trees $T$ with edge-data in a commutative ring. Moreover: for a bi-directed graph $G$ we prove
multiplicative Graham-Hoffman-Hosoya type formulas for det$(D_G)$, cof$(D_G)$, $D_G^{-1}$.
We then show how this subsumes their 1978 result. The final section introduces and computes a third,
novel invariant for trees and a Graham-Hoffman-Hosoya type result for our "most general" distance
matrix $D_T$.
