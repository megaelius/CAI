Let $\bf K$ be an arbitrary Kripke model of Heyting Arithmetic, $\sf HA$. For every node $k$ in $\bf
K$, we can view the classical structure of $k$, ${\mathfrak M}_k$ as a model of some classical theory
of arithmetic. Let $\sf T$ be a classical theory in the language of arithmetic. We say ${\bf K}$ is
locally $\sf T$, iff for every $k$ in ${\bf K}$, ${\mathfrak M}_k\models{\sf T}$. One of the most
important problems in the model theory of $\sf HA$ is the following question: {\it Is every Kripke
model of $\sf HA$ locally $\sf PA$?} We answer this question negatively. We provide two new Kripke
model constructions for this matter. The first one is a direct construction of a Kripke model ${\bf
K}\Vdash{\sf HA}+\mathsf{ECT_0}$ ($\mathsf{ECT_0}$ stands for Extended Church Thesis) with
the root $r$ such that ${\mathfrak M}_r\not \models {\bf I}\Delta_1$ and hence ${\bf K}$ is not even
locally ${\bf I}\Delta_1$. The second Kripke model construction is an implicit way of doing the
first construction which works for any reasonable consistent intuitionistic arithmetical theory
${\sf T}$ with a recursively enumerable set of axioms that has Existence property. From the second
construction we construct a Kripke model ${\bf K}\Vdash {\sf HA}+\neg\theta+{\sf MP}$ ($\theta$
is an instance of $\mathsf{ECT_0}$ and ${\sf MP}$ is Markov principle) with the root $r$ such that
${\mathfrak M}_r\not\models{\bf I}\Delta_1$. Also, we will prove that every countable Kripke
model of intuitionistic first-order logic can be transformed into another Kripke model with the
full infinite binary tree as the Kripke frame such that both Kripke models force the same sentences.
So with the previous result, there is a binary Kripke model ${\bf K}$ of $\sf HA$ such that ${\bf K}$
is not locally ${\sf PA}$.
