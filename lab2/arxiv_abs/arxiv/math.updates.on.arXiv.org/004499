The classical Morse--Sard theorem claims that for a mapping $v:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^{m+1}$
of class $C^k$ the measure of critical values $v(Z_{v,m})$ is zero under condition $k\ge n-m$. Here
the critical set, or $m$-critical set is defined as $Z_{v,m} = \{ x \in \mathbb R^n : \, {\rm rank}\,\nabla
v(x)\le m \}$. Further Dubovitski\u{\i} in 1957 and independently Federer and Dubovitski\u{\i}
in 1967 found some elegant extensions of this theorem to the case of other (e.g., lower) smoothness
assumptions. They also established the sharpness of their results within the $C^k$ category. Here
we formulate and prove a \textit{bridge theorem} that includes all the above results as particular
cases: namely, if a function $v:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^d$ belongs to the Holder class $C^{k,\alpha}$,
$0\le\alpha\le1$, then for every $q>m$ the identity $$\mathcal H^{\mu}(Z_{v,m}\cap v^{-1}(y))=0$$
holds for $\mathcal H^q$-almost all $y\in\mathbb R^d$, where $\mu=n-m-(k+\alpha)(q-m)$. The
result is new even for the classical $C^k$-case (when $\alpha=0$); a similar result is established
for the Sobolev classes of mappings $W^k_p(\mathbb R^n,\mathbb R^d)$ with minimal integrability
assumptions $p=\max(1,n/k)$, i.e., it guarantees in general only the continuity (not everywhere
differentiability) of a mapping. However, using some $N$-properties for Sobolev mappings, established
in our previous paper, we obtained that the sets of nondifferentiability points of Sobolev mappings
are fortunately negligible in the above bridge theorem. We cover also the case of fractional Sobolev
spaces. The proofs of the most results are based on our previous joint papers with J. Bourgain and
J. Kristensen (2013, 2015).
