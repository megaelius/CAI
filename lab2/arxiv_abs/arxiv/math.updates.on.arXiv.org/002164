This work introduces a novel estimation method, called LOVE, of the entries and structure of a loading
matrix A in a sparse latent factor model X = AZ + E, for an observable random vector X in Rp, with correlated
unobservable factors Z \in RK, with K unknown, and independent noise E. Each row of A is scaled and
sparse. In order to identify the loading matrix A, we require the existence of pure variables, which
are components of X that are associated, via A, with one and only one latent factor. Despite the fact
that the number of factors K, the number of the pure variables, and their location are all unknown,
we only require a mild condition on the covariance matrix of Z, and a minimum of only two pure variables
per latent factor to show that A is uniquely defined, up to signed permutations. Our proofs for model
identifiability are constructive, and lead to our novel estimation method of the number of factors
and of the set of pure variables, from a sample of size n of observations on X. This is the first step
of our LOVE algorithm, which is optimization-free, and has low computational complexity of order
p2. The second step of LOVE is an easily implementable linear program that estimates A. We prove that
the resulting estimator is minimax rate optimal up to logarithmic factors in p. The model structure
is motivated by the problem of overlapping variable clustering, ubiquitous in data science. We
define the population level clusters as groups of those components of X that are associated, via
the sparse matrix A, with the same unobservable latent factor, and multi-factor association is
allowed. Clusters are respectively anchored by the pure variables, and form overlapping sub-groups
of the p-dimensional random vector X. The Latent model approach to OVErlapping clustering is reflected
in the name of our algorithm, LOVE.
