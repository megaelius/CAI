Thinking back the long history of physics, we see that the calculation used by physicists was nothing
but the ordinary calculus. Another word, physicists have never wrote theories beyond the basic
axioms of the calculus. This is not to declare of the victory of calculus or algebraic topology. On
the contrary, we are thinking that every theory of mathematical physics must suggest new frontier
of ordinary calculus, which are never viewed by classical geometers. Weyl algebras or Heisenberg
algebras are naturally involved in slightly extended systems of the algebra of ordinary calculus,
and are supported by the classical notion of phase spaces on which the general mechanics are based.
The theory of deformation quantizations gives a notion of quantization of "phase space". To explain
its essence in brief we proposed in the previous note the notion of $\mu$-regulated algebra. In this
series, we have introduced elements, called "vacuums" to consider the state vectors and the configuration
spaces within the world of extended algebra of calculus with various expressions. We have found
several strange elements, called polar elements, and an extended notions of vacuums, which were
called pseudo-vacuums in our paper. These are not established notions in mathematical physics,
but we are thinking that these must propose new frontier for mathematical physics. We are thinking
that vacuums and pseudo-vacuums are not unique, but the function algebra of the configuration spaces
must be an algebra similar to the Frobenius algebra defined by vacuums. The point in this note is that
to obtain classical pictures one has often to restrict the expression parameters, and there are
two essentially different expression parameters.
