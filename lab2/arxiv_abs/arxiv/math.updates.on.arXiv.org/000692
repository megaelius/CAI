Neuroscientific studies of execution of the drawing-like movements usually analyze neural representation
of either geometric (eg. direction, shape) or temporal (eg. speed) features of trajectories rather
than trajectory's representation as a whole. This work is about mathematical ideas behind splitting
and merging geometric and temporal features which characterize biological movements. Movement
primitives supposedly facilitate the efficiency of movements' representation in the brain and
comply with different criteria for biological movements, among them kinematic smoothness and
geometric constraint. Criterion for trajectories' "maximal smoothness" of arbitrary order $n$
is employed, $n = 3$ is the case of the minimum-jerk model. I derive a class of differential equations
obeyed by movement paths for which $n$th order maximally smooth trajectories have constant speed.
The speed is invariant under a class of geometric transformations. Equations' solutions presumably
serve as candidates for geometric movement primitives. The speed here is defined as the rate of accumulating
geometric measurement along the drawn path. The geometric measurement may be chosen to be an arc
in certain geometry. For example the two-thirds power-law model corresponds to piece-wise constant
speed of accumulating equi-affine arc. The derived class of differential equations consists of
two parts. The first part is identical for all geometric parameterizations of the path. The second
part is parametrization specific and is needed to identify whether a solution of the first part indeed
represents a curve. Corresponding counter-examples are provided. Equations in different geometries
in plane and in space and their known solutions are presented. The derived class of differential
equation is a novel tool for discovering candidates for geometric movement primitives.
