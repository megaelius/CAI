We present a new family of very high order accurate direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
Finite Volume (FV) and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic
PDE systems on moving 2D Voronoi meshes that are regenerated at each time step and which explicitly
allow topology changes in time. The Voronoi tessellations are obtained from a set of generator points
that move with the local fluid velocity. We employ an AREPO-type approach, which rapidly rebuilds
a new high quality mesh rearranging the element shapes and neighbors in order to guarantee a robust
mesh evolution even for vortex flows and very long simulation times. The old and new Voronoi elements
associated to the same generator are connected to construct closed space--time control volumes,
whose bottom and top faces may be polygons with a different number of sides. We also incorporate degenerate
space--time sliver elements, needed to fill the space--time holes that arise because of topology
changes. The final ALE FV-DG scheme is obtained by a redesign of the fully discrete direct ALE schemes
of Boscheri and Dumbser, extended here to moving Voronoi meshes and space--time sliver elements.
Our new numerical scheme is based on the integration over arbitrary shaped closed space--time control
volumes combined with a fully-discrete space--time conservation formulation of the governing
PDE system. In this way the discrete solution is conservative and satisfies the GCL by construction.
Numerical convergence studies as well as a large set of benchmarks for hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. Our numerical results clearly
show that the new combination of very high order schemes with regenerated meshes with topology changes
lead to substantial improvements compared to direct ALE methods on conforming meshes.
