Entanglement is an intriguing quantum phenomenon with crucial implications for both fundamental
physics and technological applications, e.g., quantum key distribution (QKD). In this paper,
we show that multipartite private states from which secret keys are directly accessible to trusted
partners are genuinely multipartite entangled states. With application to secure Quantum Internet,
we consider the most general setup of multipartite quantum process (channel) in a network setting:
multiplex quantum channel with involved parties having one of the three possible roles-- that of
only sender or receiver, or both sender and receiver. We derive divergence-based measures for entangling
abilities of multipartite quantum channels. We describe an LOCC-assisted secret key agreement
(SKA) protocol for generation or distillation of key (private random bits) among multiple trusted
allies connected through a quantum multiplex channel secure against a quantum eavesdropper, of
which \textit{measurement-device-independent} QKD and SKA protocols over quantum network laced
with \textit{key repeaters} are particular instances. We are able to provide upper bounds on the
non-asymptotic private capacities, maximum rate at which secret key can be distilled via finite
uses of channels, and lower bounds on asymptotic capacities. These bounds are expressed in terms
of the divergence-based entanglement measures of the channels. Some of these measures lead to strong
converse bounds on private capacities. Our upper bounds on the private capacities also are upper
bound on the multipartite quantum capacities where goal is to distill Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger
(GHZ) state. Also, we are able to derive upper bound on the secret key bits that can be distilled via
LOCC among trusted allies sharing finite copies of multipartite quantum states.
