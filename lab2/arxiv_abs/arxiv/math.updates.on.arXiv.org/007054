Standard lore uses local anomalies to check the kinematic consistency of gauge theories coupled
to chiral fermions, e.g. Standard Models (SM). Based on a systematic cobordism classification
[1812.11967, 1910.14668], we examine constraints from invertible quantum anomalies (including
all perturbative local and nonperturbative global anomalies) for gauge theories. We also clarify
the different uses of these anomalies: including (1) anomaly cancellations of dynamical gauge
fields, (2) 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions of background fields of global symmetries, and
others. We find several 4d $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ anomaly constraints of $n=16,4,2$, beyond the familiar
$\mathbb{Z}$ class local anomalies of Feynman graphs, and also beyond Witten SU(2) and the new SU(2)
global anomalies. As an application, for (SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1))/$\mathbb{Z}_6$
SM with 15n chiral Weyl fermions (e.g. SU(5) Grand Unification) and a discrete $X=5(B-L)-4Y$ preserved,
we discover a new hidden sector previously unknown to Georgi-Glashow model -- by appending to the
known SM nearly gapless sector, we propose a new strongly-correlated gapped sector with a new Topological
Mass mechanism: either (1) 4d non-invertible non-abelian topological quantum field theory (TQFT)
at low energy but with heavy anyon excitations from 1d particle worldline and 2d string worldsheet
coupled to gravity (accessible from neither Dirac nor Majorana mass gap for the 16th Weyl fermions:
3 generations of right-handed neutrinos, but from the dual fermionic vortex zero mode bound state
condensation via topological quantum phase transition or 4d duality/"mirror symmetry") or (2)
5d TQFT in extra dimensions. Above a higher energy scale, the discrete $X$ becomes gauged, the entangled
Universe in 4d and 5d is mediated by Topological Force. Our model resolves puzzles, surmounting
sterile neutrinos and dark matter, in fundamental physics.
