Two key ingredients to carry out inference on the copula of multivariate observations are the empirical
copula process and an appropriate resampling scheme for the latter. Among the existing techniques
used for i.i.d.\ observations, the multiplier bootstrap of \cite{RemSca09} frequently appears
to lead to inference procedures with the best finite-sample properties. \cite{BucRup13} recently
proposed an extension of this technique to strictly stationary strongly mixing observations by
adapting the {\em dependent} multiplier bootstrap of \citet[Section 3.3]{Buh93} to the empirical
copula process. The main contribution of this work is a generalization of the multiplier resampling
scheme proposed by \cite{BucRup13} along two directions. First, the resampling scheme is now genuinely
sequential, thereby allowing to transpose to the strongly mixing setting all of the existing multiplier
tests on the unknown copula, including nonparametric tests for change-point detection. Second,
the resampling scheme is now fully automatic as a data-adaptive procedure is proposed which can
be used to estimate the bandwidth parameter. A simulation study is used to investigate the finite-sample
performance of the resampling scheme and provides suggestions on how to choose several additional
parameters. As by-products of this work, the validity of a sequential version of the dependent multiplier
bootstrap for empirical processes of B\"uhlmann is obtained under weaker conditions on the strong
mixing coefficients and the multipliers, and the weak convergence of the sequential empirical
copula process is obtained under many serial dependence conditions.
