We introduce ensembles of repelling charged particles restricted to a ball in a non-archimedean
field (such as the $p$-adic numbers) with interaction energy between pairs of particles proportional
to the logarithm of the ($p$-adic) distance between them. In the {\em canonical ensemble}, a system
of $N$ particles is put in contact with a heat bath at fixed inverse temperature $\beta$ and energy
is allowed to flow between the system and the heat bath. Using standard axioms of statistical physics,
the relative density of states is given by the $\beta$ power of the ($p$-adic) absolute value of the
Vandermonde determinant in the locations of the particles. The partition function is the normalizing
constant (as a function of $\beta$) of this ensemble, and we identify a recursion that allows this
to be computed explicitly in finite time. Probabilities of interest, including the probabilities
that specified subsets will have a prescribed occupation number of particles, and the conditional
distribution of particles within a subset given a prescribed occupation number, are given explicitly
in terms of the partition function. We then turn to the {\em grand canonical ensemble} where both
the energy and number of particles are variable. We compute similar probabilities to those in the
canonical ensemble and show how these probabilities can be given in terms the canonical and grand
canonical partition functions. Finally, we briefly consider the multi-component ensemble where
particles are allowed to take different integer charges, and we connect basic properties of this
ensemble to the canonical and grand canonical ensembles.
