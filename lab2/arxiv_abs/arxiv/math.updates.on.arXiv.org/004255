In this paper we consider a conjecture formulated by the second author in occasion of the 1998 ICM
in Berlin (arXiv:math/9807034v2). This conjecture states the equivalence, for a Fano variety
$X$, of the semisimplicity condition for the quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet(X)$ with the existence
condition of full exceptional collections in the derived category of coherent sheaves $\mathcal
D^b(X)$. Furthermore, in its quantitative formulation, the conjecture also prescribes an explicit
relationship between the monodromy data of $QH^\bullet(X)$ and characteristic classes of both
$X$ and objects of the exceptional collections. In this paper we reformulate a refinement of (arXiv:math/9807034v2),
which corrects a previous ansatz (lecture of the second author at Strasbourg) for what concerns
the conjectural expression of the central connection matrix. We clarify the precise relationship
between the refined conjecture presented in this paper and $\Gamma$-conjecture II of S. Galkin,
V. Golyshev and H. Iritani (arXiv:1404.6407v4, arXiv:1508.00719v3). Through an explicit computation
of the monodromy data and a detailed analysis of the action of the braid group on both the monodromy
data and the set of exceptional collections, we prove the validity of our refined conjecture for
all complex Grassmannians $\mathbb G(r,k)$. From these results, it is outlined an explicit description
of the "geography" of the exceptional collections realizable at points of the small quantum cohomology
of Grassmannians, i.e. corresponding to the monodromy data at these points. In particular, it is
proved that Kapranov's exceptional collection appears at points of the small quantum cohomology
only for Grassmannians of small dimension (namely, less or equal than 2). Finally, a property of
quasi-periodicity of the Stokes matrices of complex Grassmannians, along the locus of the small
quantum cohomology, is described.
