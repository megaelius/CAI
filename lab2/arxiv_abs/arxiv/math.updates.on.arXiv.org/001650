This is the first of three papers that develop structures which are counted by a "parabolic" generalization
of Catalan numbers. Fix a subset R of {1,..,n-1}. Consider the ordered partitions of {1,..,n} whose
block sizes are determined by R. These are the "inverses" of (parabolic) multipermutations whose
multiplicities are determined by R. The standard forms of the ordered partitions are refered to
as "R-permutations". The notion of 312-avoidance is extended from permutations to R-permutations.
Let lambda be a partition of N such that the set of column lengths in its shape is R or R union {n}. Fix
an R-permutation pi. The type A Demazure character (key polynomial) in x_1, .., x_n that is indexed
by lambda and pi can be described as the sum of the weight monomials for some of the semistandard Young
tableau of shape lambda that are used to describe the Schur function indexed by lambda. Descriptions
of these "Demazure" tableaux developed by the authors in earlier papers are used to prove that the
set of these tableaux is convex in Z^N if and only if pi is R-312-avoiding if and only if the tableau
set is the entire principal ideal generated by the key of pi. These papers were inspired by results
of Reiner and Shimozono and by Postnikov and Stanley concerning coincidences between Demazure
characters and flagged Schur functions. This convexity result is used in the next paper to deepen
those results from the level of polynomials to the level of tableau sets. The R-parabolic Catalan
number is defined to be the number of R-312-avoiding permutations. These special R-permutations
are reformulated as "R-rightmost clump deleting" chains of subsets of {1,..,n} and as "gapless
R-tuples"; the latter n-tuples arise in multiple contexts in these papers.
