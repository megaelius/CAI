In this paper, we provide the first rigorous derivation of hydrodynamic equations from the Boltzmann
equation for inelastic hard spheres with small inelasticity. The hydrodynamic system that we obtain
is an incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with self-consistent forcing terms and is
thus the first hydrodynamic system that properly describes rapid granular flows. To do that, we
write our Boltzmann equation in nondimensional form introducing the dimensionless Knudsen number
which is intended to tend to 0. The difficulties are then manyfold, the first one coming from the fact
that the original Boltzmann equation is free-cooling and thus requires a self-similar change of
variables to work with an equation that has an homogeneous steady state. The latter is not explicit
and is heavy-tailed, which is a major obstacle to adapt energy estimates and spectral analysis.
One of the main challenges here is to understand the relation between the restitution coefficient
(which quantifies the loss of energy at the microscopic level) and the Knudsen number. This is done
identifying the correct nearly elastic regime to capture nontrivial hydrodynamic behavior. We
are then able to prove exponential stability uniformly with respect to the Knudsen number of the
solution of our rescaled Boltzmann equation in a close to equilibrium regime. Finally, we prove
that our solution to the Boltzmann equation converges in some very specific weak sense towards some
hydrodynamic solution which depends on time and space variables only through macroscopic quantities.
Such macroscopic quantities are solutions to a suitable modification of the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier
system which appears to be new in this context.
