Delattre et al. (2013) considered a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in a random
effects setup. Under the independent and identical (iid) situation, and assuming normal distribution
of the random effects, they established weak consistency of the maximum likelihood estimators
(MLEs) of the population parameters of the random effects. In this article, respecting the increasing
importance and versatility of normal mixtures and their ability to approximate any standard distribution,
we consider the random effects having finite mixture of normal distributions and prove asymptotic
results associated with the MLEs in both independent and identical (iid) and independent but not
identical (non-iid) situations. Besides, we consider iid and non-iid setups under the Bayesian
paradigm and establish posterior consistency and asymptotic normality of the posterior distribution
of the population parameters, even when the number of mixture components is unknown and treated
as a random variable. It is important to note that Delattre et al. (2016) also assumed the SDE setup
with normal mixture distribution of the random effect parameters but considered only the iid case
and proved only weak consistency of the MLE under an extra, strong assumption as opposed to strong
consistency that we are able to prove without the extra assumption. Furthermore, they did not deal
with asymptotic normality of MLE or the Bayesian asymptotics counterpart which we investigate
in details. Ample simulation experiments and application to a real, stock market data set reveal
the importance and usefulness of our methods even for small samples.
