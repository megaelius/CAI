A post-processing adjustment technique which aims for enhancement of dual-frequency SURF (Second
order UltRasound Field) reverberation-noise suppression imaging in medical ultrasound is analyzed.
Two variant methods are investigated through numerical simulations. They both solely involve
post-processing of the propagated high-frequency (HF) imaging wave fields, which in real-time
imaging corresponds to post-processing of the beamformed receive radio-frequency signals. Hence
the transmit pulse complexes are the same as for the previously published SURF reverberation-suppression
imaging method. The adjustment technique is tested on simulated data from propagation of SURF pulse
complexes consisting of a 3.5 MHz HF imaging pulse added to a 0.5 low-frequency sound-speed manipulation
pulse. Imaging transmit beams are constructed with and without adjustment. The post-processing
involves filtering, e.g., by a time-shift, in order to equalize the two SURF HF pulses at a chosen
depth. This depth is typically chosen to coincide with the depth where the first scattering or reflection
occurs for the reverberation noise one intends to suppress. The beams realized with post-processing
show energy decrease at the chosen depth, especially for shallow depths where in a medical imaging
situation often a body-wall is located. This indicates that the post-processing may further enhance
the reverberation-suppression abilities of SURF imaging. Moreover, it is shown that the methods
might be utilized to reduce the accumulated near-field energy of the SURF transmit-beam relative
to its imaging region energy. The adjustments presented may therefore potentially be utilized
to attain a slightly better general suppression of multiple scattering and multiple reflection
noise compared to for non-adjusted SURF reverberation-suppression imaging.
