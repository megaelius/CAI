The theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) is usually defined w.r.t. log-correlated Gaussian
fields in the finite dimensional context and dates back to a seminal work of Kahane [K85] which contains
ideas and results that led to a lot of rejuvenated interest in the subject during the last decade.
Inspired by ongoing investigations pertinent to the Liouville measure in $2d$-Liouville quantum
gravity, thick points of the Gaussian free field and volume decay of Liouville balls and scaling
exponents, in the present infinite dimensional context we drop all assumptions on log-correlations
and consider a centered Gaussian field, driven by space-time white noise and indexed by continuous
paths equipped with the law of Brownian paths on $\mathbb R^d$ as reference measure. An exponentiation
of this field, followed by suitable renormalization, defines a Gaussian multiplicative chaos
on Wiener paths. As long as the coupling constant is tuned sufficiently low (and in this regime it
is known that for $d\geq 3$, the field attains high values on any path sampled according to the GMC
probability measure) and with the white noise field spatially mollified at scale $\varepsilon>0$,
the (renormalized) GMC volume of any microscopic ball of radius $\varepsilon^{d/2}$ in the Wiener
space, with its location chosen uniformly therein, decays at least with speed $\varepsilon^d$
in an almost sure sense as the mollification scheme is turned off. A key aspect of our proof, while
not making any assumptions about log-correlations, builds on Kahane's techniques [K85] in a general
set up, combined with geometric properties of the underlying metric space of continuous functions.
