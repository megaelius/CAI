Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with
explicit time-stepping schemes, such as strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK),
suffer from time-step restrictions that are significantly worse than what a simple Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
(CFL) argument requires. In particular, the maximum stable time-step scales inversely with the
highest degree in the DG polynomial approximation space and becomes progressively smaller with
each added spatial dimension. In this work we introduce a novel approach that we have dubbed the regionally
implicit discontinuous Galerkin (RIDG) method to overcome these small time-step restrictions.
The RIDG method is based on an extension of the Lax-Wendroff DG (LxW-DG) method, which previously
had been shown to be equivalent to a predictor-corrector approach, where the predictor is a locally
implicit spacetime method (i.e., the predictor is something like a block-Jacobi update for a fully
implicit spacetime DG method). The corrector is an explicit method that uses the spacetime reconstructed
solution from the predictor step. In this work we modify the predictor to include not just local information,
but also neighboring information. With this modification we show that the stability is greatly
enhanced; in particular, we show that we are able to remove the polynomial degree dependence of the
maximum time-step and show how this extends to multiple spatial dimensions. A semi-analytic von
Neumann analysis is presented to theoretically justify the stability claims. Convergence and
efficiency studies for linear and nonlinear problems in multiple dimensions are accomplished
using a MATLAB code that can be freely downloaded.
