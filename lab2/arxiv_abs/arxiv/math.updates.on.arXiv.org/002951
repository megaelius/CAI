A graph $H$ is pervasive (in some class of graphs) if for all $t\ge 1$, every graph in the class of bounded
clique number and sufficiently large chromatic number has an induced subgraph that is a subdivision
of $H$ in which every edge of $H$ is replaced by a path of at least $t$ edges. It is known that every forest
and cycle is pervasive in the class of all graphs. Which other graphs are pervasive? It is known that
every such graph is a forest of chandeliers (every block is obtained from a tree by adding a vertex
adjacent to its leaves, and there are rules about how blocks fit together). It is not known whether
every forest of chandeliers is pervasive in the class of all graphs. Say a class of graphs is $r$-controlled
if for every graph in the class, its chromatic number is at most some function (determined by the class)
of the largest chromatic number of an $r$-ball in the graph. In this paper we prove that for every $r\ge
2$, and for every $r$-controlled class, every forest of chandeliers is pervasive in this class.
In a later paper, two of us build on the results here to prove that a large class of forests of chandeliers
is pervasive in the class of all graphs. Our results turn out particularly nicely when applied to
string graphs. A string graph is the intersection graph of a set of curves in the plane. It is known
that there are string graphs with clique number two and chromatic number arbitrarily large. We prove
that the class of string graphs is $2$-controlled, and consequently every forest of chandeliers
is pervasive in this class; in fact, we show that every string graph with bounded clique number and
sufficiently large chromatic number contains each fixed chandelier as an induced subgraph (not
just as a subdivision).
