Recall that if $(M^n,g)$ satisfies $\mathrm{Ric}\geq 0$, then the Li-Yau Differential Harnack
Inequality tells us for each nonnegative $f:M\to \mathbb{R}^+$, with $f_t$ its heat flow, that
$\frac{\Delta f_t}{f_t}-\frac{|\nabla f_t|^2}{f_t^2} +\frac{n}{2t}\geq 0.$ Our main result
will be to generalize this to path space $P_xM$ of the manifold. A key point is that instead of considering
infinite dimensional gradients and Laplacians on $P_xM$ we will consider a family of finite dimensional
gradients and Laplace operators. Namely, for each $H^1_0$-function $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^+\to
\mathbb{R}$ we will define the $\varphi$-gradient $\nabla_\varphi F: P_xM\to T_xM$ and the $\varphi$-Laplacian
$\Delta_\varphi F =\text{tr}_\varphi\mathrm{Hess} F:P_xM\to \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathrm{Hess}
F$ is the Markovian Hessian and both the gradient and the $\varphi$-trace are induced by $n$ vector
fields naturally associated to $\varphi$ under stochastic parallel translation. Now let $(M^n,g)$
satisfy $\mathrm{Ric}=0$, then for each nonnegative $F:P_xM\to \mathbb{R}^+$ we will show the
inequality $$\frac{E_x [\Delta_\varphi F]}{E_x [F]}-\frac{E_x [\nabla_\varphi F]^2}{E_x
[F]^2} +\frac{n}{2}|| \varphi ||^2\geq 0$$ for each $\varphi$, where $E_x$ denotes the expectation
with respect to the Wiener measure on $P_xM$. By applying this to the simplest functions on path space,
namely cylinder functions of one variable $F(\gamma) \equiv f(\gamma(t))$, we will see we recover
the classical Li-Yau Harnack inequality exactly. We have similar estimates for Einstein manifolds,
with errors depending only on the Einstein constant, as well as for general manifolds, with errors
depending on the curvature. Finally, we derive generalizations of Hamilton's Matrix Harnack inequality
on path space $P_xM$. It is our understanding that these estimates are new even on the path space of
$\mathbb{R}^n$.
