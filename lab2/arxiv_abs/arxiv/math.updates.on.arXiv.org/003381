The paper deals with Henselian valued field with analytic structure. Actually, we are focused on
separated analytic structures, but the results remain valid for strictly convergent analytic
ones as well. A classical example of the latter is a complete rank one valued fields with the Tate algebra
of strictly convergent power series. The algebraic case was treated in our previous papers. Here
we are going to carry over the research to the general analytic settings. Also considered are the
local rings of analytic function germs induced by a given separated Weierstrass system, which turn
out to be excellent and regular. Several results are established as, for instance, piecewise continuity
of definable functions, several versions of the \L{}ojasiewicz inequality, H\"{o}lder continuity
of definable functions continuous on closed bounded subsets of the affine space and curve selection
for definable sets. Likewise as before, at the center of our approach is the closedness theorem to
the effect that every projection with closed bounded fiber is a definably closed map. It enables
application of resolution of singularities and of transformation to a normal crossing by blowing
up (here applied to the local rings of analytic function germs) in much the same way as over locally
compact ground fields. We rely on elimination of valued field quantifiers, term structure of definable
functions and b-minimal cell decomposition, due to Cluckers--Lipshitz--Robinson, as well as
on relative quantifier elimination for ordered abelian groups, due to Cluckers--Halupczok. Besides,
other two ingredients of the proof of the closedness theorem are existence of the limit (after finite
partitioning of the domain) for a definable function of one variable and fiber shrinking, being
a relaxed version of curve selection.
