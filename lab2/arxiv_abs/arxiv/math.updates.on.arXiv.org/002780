One of the main goals of this paper is to extend some of the mathematical techniques of some previous
papers by the authors showing that some very useful phenomenological properties which can be observed
to the nano-scale can be simulated and justified mathematically by means of some homogenization
processes when a certain critical scale is used in the corresponding framework. Here the motivating
problem in consideration is formulated in the context of the reverse osmosis. We consider, on a part
of the boundary of a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^n$, a set of very small periodically distributed
semipermeable membranes having an ideal infinite permeability coefficient (which leads to Signorini
type boundary conditions) on a part $\Gamma_1$ of the boundary. We also assume that a possible chemical
reaction may take place on the membranes. We obtain the rigorous convergence of the problems to a
homogenized problem in which there is a change in the constitutive nonlinearities. Changes of this
type are the reason for the big success of the nanocomposite materials. Our proof is carried out for
membranes not necessarily of radially symmetric shape. The definition of the associated critical
scale depends on the dimension of the space (and it is quite peculiar for the special case of $n=2$).
Roughly speaking, our result proves that the consideration of the critical case of the scale leads
to an homogenized formulation which is equivalent to have a global semipermeable membrane, at the
whole part of the boundary $\Gamma_1$, with a "finite permeability coefficient of this virtual
membrane" which is the best we can get, even if the original problem involves a set of membranes of
any arbitrary finite permeability coefficients.
