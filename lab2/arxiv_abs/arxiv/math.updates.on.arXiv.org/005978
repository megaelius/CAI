Work in $\mathsf{ZF}$ or $\mathsf{ZF}_2$ (second order $\mathsf{ZF}$), as appropriate. Recall
that a Reinhardt cardinal is the critical point of a (non-trivial) elementary embedding $j:V\rightarrow
V$. Beyond these, one has super-Reinhardt, total Reinhardt and Berkeley cardinals. We prove the
following results. Let $X$ be a set and $A$ a class. Then (i) if there is a Reinhardt cardinal then $V\neq\mathrm{HOD}(X)$,
and (ii) if $V$ is total Reinhardt or there is a Berkeley cardinal then $V\neq\mathrm{HOD}_A(X)$.
Let $\delta$ be a limit ordinal and $j:V_\delta\to V_\delta$ be $\Sigma_1$-elementary. Then (i)
$j$ is not definable from parameters over $V_\delta$, and (ii) there is $n<\omega$ such that the
$n^{\mathrm{th}}$ iterate $j^n=j(j(\ldots (j))):V_\delta\to V_\delta$ is fully elementary;
in fact, $j^n:(V_\delta,A)\to(V_\delta,j^n(A))$ is fully elementary for all $A\subseteq V_\delta$.
Let $\delta$ be any ordinal and $j:V_{\delta+1}\to V_{\delta+1}$ be fully elementary. Then $j$
is not definable over $V_{\delta+1}$ from parameters in $V_\delta$. Suppose $V=L(V_\delta)$
and $\mathrm{cof}(\delta)>\omega$. Then there is no $\Sigma_1$-elementary $j:V_\delta\to
V_\delta$. Let $G$ be $(V,\mathbb{P})$-generic for some $\mathbb{P}\in V$. Then (i) if $V[G]$
has a super-Reinhardt cardinal, then $V$ has a super-Reinhardt cardinal; (ii) if $\mathbb{P}\in
V_\delta$ and $V[G]\models$``$V_\delta^{V[G]}$ is total Reinhardt'' then $V\models$``$V_\delta$
is total Reinhardt''; and (iii) if $V[G]$ has a set of ordinals which is not in $V$, then $V[G]$ has
no elementary $j:V[G]\to M\subseteq V$. We also develop the theory of ultrapowers by extenders
under $\mathsf{ZF}$, and show that if there is a proper class of L\"owenheim-Skolem cardinals,
then being the critical point of an elementary $j:V\to M$ (with $M$ transitive) is first-order.
