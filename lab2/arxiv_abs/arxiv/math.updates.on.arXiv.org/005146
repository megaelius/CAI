In this paper, we introduce operators that are represented by upper triangular $2\times 2$ block
matrices whose entries satisfy some algebraic constraints. We call them Brownian-type operators
of class $\mathcal Q,$ briefly operators of class $\mathcal Q.$ These operators emerged from the
study of Brownian isometries performed by Agler and Stankus via detailed analysis of the time shift
operator of the modified Brownian motion process. It turns out that the class $\mathcal Q$ is closely
related to the Cauchy dual subnormality problem which asks whether the Cauchy dual of a completely
hyperexpansive operator is subnormal. Since the class $\mathcal Q$ is closed under the operation
of taking the Cauchy dual, the problem itself becomes a part of a more general question of investigating
subnormality in this class. This issue, along with the analysis of nonstandard moment problems,
covers a large part of the paper. Using the Taylor spectrum technique culminates in a full characterization
of subnormal operators of class $\mathcal Q.$ As a consequence, we solve the Cauchy dual subnormality
problem for expansive operators of class $\mathcal Q$ in the affirmative, showing that the original
problem can surprisingly be extended to a class of operators that are far from being completely hyperexpansive.
The Taylor spectrum approach turns out to be fruitful enough to allow us to characterize other classes
of operators including $m$-isometries. We also study linear operator pencils associated with
operators of class $\mathcal Q$ proving that the corresponding regions of subnormality are closed
intervals with explicitly described endpoints.
