When choosing the right copula for our data a key point is to distinguish the family that describes
it at the best. In this respect, a better choice of the copulas could be obtained through the information
about the (non)symmetry of the data. Exchangeability as a probability concept (first next to independence)
has been studied since 1930's, copulas have been studied since 1950's, and even the most important
class of copulas from the point of view of applications, i.e. the ones arising from shock models s.a.
Marshall's copulas, have been studied since 1960's. However, the point of non-exchangeability
of copulas was brought up only in 2006 and has been intensively studied ever since. One of the main
contributions of this paper is the maximal asymmetry function for a family of copulas. We compute
this function for the major families of shock-based copulas, i.e. Marshall, maxmin and reflected
maxmin (RMM for short) copulas and also for some other important families. We compute the sharp bound
of asymmetry measure $\mu_\infty$, the most important of the asymmetry measures, for the family
of Marshall copulas and the family of maxmin copulas, which both equal to $\frac{4}{27}\ (\approx
0.148)$. One should compare this bound to the one for the class of PQD copulas to which they belong,
which is $3-2\sqrt{2}\ \approx 0.172)$, and to the general bound for all copulas that is $\frac13$.
Furthermore, we give the sharp bound of the same asymmetry measure for RMM copulas which is $3-2\sqrt{2}$,
compared to the same bound for NQD copulas, where they belong, which is $\sqrt{5}-2\ (\approx 0.236)$.
One of our main results is also the statistical interpretation of shocks in a given model at which
the maximal asymmetry measure bound is attained. These interpretations for the three families
studied are illustrated by examples that should be helpful to practitioners when choosing the model
for their data.
