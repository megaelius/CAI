In this paper, we consider the potential of data-transmission in a system with a massive number of
radiating and sensing elements, thought of as a contiguous surface of electromagnetically active
material. We refer to this as a large intelligent surface (LIS). The "LIS" is a newly proposed concept,
which conceptually goes beyond contemporary massive MIMO technology, that arises from our vision
of a future where man-made structures are electronically active with integrated electronics and
wireless communication making the entire environment "intelligent". We consider capacities
of single-antenna autonomous terminals communicating to the LIS where the entire surface is used
as a receiving antenna array. Under the condition that the surface-area is sufficiently large,
the received signal after a matched-filtering (MF) operation can be closely approximated by a sinc-function-like
intersymbol interference (ISI) channel. We analyze the capacity per square meter (m^2) deployed
surface, \hat{C}, that is achievable for a fixed transmit power per volume-unit, \hat{P}. Moreover,
we also show that the number of independent signal dimensions per m deployed surface is 2/\lambda
for one-dimensional terminal-deployment, and \pi/\lambda^2 per m^2 for two and three dimensional
terminal-deployments. Lastly, we consider implementations of the LIS in the form of a grid of conventional
antenna elements and show that, the sampling lattice that minimizes the surface-area of the LIS
and simultaneously obtains one signal space dimension for every spent antenna is the hexagonal
lattice. We extensively discuss the design of the state-of-the-art low-complexity channel shortening
(CS) demodulator for data-transmission with the LIS.
