Recently increasing penetration of renewable energy generation brings challenges for power system
operators to perform efficient power generation daily scheduling, due to the intermittent nature
of the renewable generation and discrete decisions of each generation unit. Among all aspects to
be considered, a unit commitment polytope is fundamental and embedded in the models at different
stages of power system planning and operations. In this paper, we focus on deriving polynomial time
algorithms for the unit commitment problems with general convex cost function and piecewise linear
cost function respectively. We refine an $\mathcal{O}(T^3)$ time, where $ T $ represents the number
of time periods, algorithm for the deterministic single-generator unit commitment problem with
general convex cost function and accordingly develop an extended formulation in a higher dimensional
space that can provide an integral solution, in which the physical meanings of the decision variables
are described. It means the original problem can be solved as a convex program instead of a mixed-integer
convex program. Furthermore, for the case in which the cost function is piecewise linear, by exploring
the optimality conditions, we derive more efficient algorithms for both deterministic (i.e.,
$\mathcal{O}(T)$ time) and stochastic (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time, where $N$ represents the
number of nodes in the stochastic scenario tree) \rred{single-generator} unit commitment problems.
We also develop the corresponding extended formulations for both deterministic and stochastic
single-generator unit commitment problems that solve the original mixed-integer linear programs
as linear programs. Similarly, physical meanings of the decision variables are explored to show
the insights of the new modeling approach.
