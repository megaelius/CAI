We introduce the notion of fully simple maps, which are maps with non self-intersecting disjoint
boundaries. In contrast, maps where such a restriction is not imposed are called ordinary. We study
in detail the combinatorics of fully simple maps with topology of a disk or a cylinder. We show that
the generating series of simple disks is given by the functional inversion of the generating series
of ordinary disks. We also obtain an elegant formula for cylinders. These relations reproduce the
relation between moments and free cumulants established by Collins et al. math.OA/0606431, and
implement the symplectic transformation $x \leftrightarrow y$ on the spectral curve in the context
of topological recursion. We conjecture that the generating series of fully simple maps are computed
by the topological recursion after exchange of $x$ and $y$. We propose an argument to prove this statement
conditionally to a mild version of symplectic invariance for the $1$-hermitian matrix model, which
is believed to be true but has not been proved yet. Our argument relies on an (unconditional) matrix
model interpretation of fully simple maps, via the formal hermitian matrix model with external
field. We also deduce a universal relation between generating series of fully simple maps and of
ordinary maps, which involves double monotone Hurwitz numbers. In particular, (ordinary) maps
without internal faces -- which are generated by the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble -- and with boundary
perimeters $(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n)$ are strictly monotone double Hurwitz numbers with
ramifications $\lambda$ above $\infty$ and $(2,\ldots,2)$ above $0$. Combining with a recent
result of Dubrovin et al. math-ph/1612.02333, this implies an ELSV-like formula for these Hurwitz
numbers.
