We examine two aspects of the mathematical basis for two-tier voting systems, such as that of the
Council of the European Union. These aspects concern the use of square-root weights and the choice
of quota. Square-root weights originate in the Penrose square-root system, which assumes that
votes are cast independently and uniformly at random, and is based around the concept of equality
of influence of the voters across the Union. There are (at least) two distinct definitions of influence
in current use in probability theory, namely, absolute and conditional influence. These are in
agreement when the underlying random variables are independent, but not generally. We review their
possible implications for two-tier voting systems, especially in the context of the so-called
collective bias model. We show that the two square-root laws invoked by Penrose are unified through
the use of conditional influence. In an elaboration of the square-root system, Slomczynski and
Zyczkowski have proposed an exact value for the quota $q=q^*$ to be achieved in a successful vote
of a two-tier system, and they have presented numerical and theoretical evidence in its support.
We indicate some numerical and mathematical issues arising in the use of a Gaussian (or normal) approximation
in this context, and we propose that other values of $q$ may be as good if not better than $q^*$. We discuss
certain aspects of the relationship between theoreticians and politicians in the design of a two-tier
voting system, and we reach the conclusion that the choice of quota in the square-root system is an
issue for politicians informed by theory.
