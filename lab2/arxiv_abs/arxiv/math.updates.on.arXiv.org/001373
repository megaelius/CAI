Let $(\mathcal G, \Sigma)$ be an ordered abelian group with Haar measure $\mu$, let $(\mathcal A,
\mathcal G, \alpha)$ be a dynamical system and let $\mathcal A\rtimes_{\alpha} \Sigma $ be the associated
semicrossed product. Using Takai duality we establish a stable isomorphism \[ \mathcal A\rtimes_{\alpha}
\Sigma \sim_{s} \big(\mathcal A \otimes \mathcal K(\mathcal G, \Sigma, \mu)\big)\rtimes_{\alpha\otimes
{\rm Ad}\: \rho} \mathcal G, \] where $\mathcal K(\mathcal G, \Sigma, \mu)$ denotes the compact
operators in the CSL algebra ${\rm Alg}\:\mathcal L(\mathcal G, \Sigma, \mu)$ and $\rho$ denotes
the right regular representation of $\mathcal G$. We also show that there exists a complete lattice
isomorphism between the $\hat{\alpha}$-invariant ideals of $\mathcal A\rtimes_{\alpha} \Sigma$
and the $(\alpha\otimes {\rm Ad}\: \rho)$-invariant ideals of $\mathcal A \otimes \mathcal K(\mathcal
G, \Sigma, \mu)$. Using Takai duality we also continue our study of the Radical for the crossed product
of an operator algebra and we solve open problems stemming from the earlier work of the authors. Among
others we show that the crossed product of a radical operator algebra by a compact abelian group is
a radical operator algebra. We also show that the permanence of semisimplicity fails for crossed
products by $\mathbb R$. A final section of the paper is devoted to the study of radically tight dynamical
systems, i.e., dynamical systems $(\mathcal A, \mathcal G, \alpha)$ for which the identity ${\rm
Rad}(\mathcal A \rtimes_\alpha \mathcal G)=({\rm Rad}\:\mathcal A) \rtimes_\alpha \mathcal
G$ persists. A broad class of such dynamical systems is identified.
