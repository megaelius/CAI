This paper investigates the finite-horizon optimal control (FHOC) problem of Boolean control
networks (BCNs) from a graph theory perspective. We first formulate two general problems to unify
various special cases studied in the literature: (i) the horizon length is $\textit{a priori}$
fixed; (ii) the horizon length is unspecified but finite for given destination states. Notably,
both problems can incorporate time-variant costs, which are rarely considered in existing work,
and a variety of constraints. The existence of an optimal control sequence is analyzed under mild
assumptions. Motivated by BCNs' finite state space and control space, we approach the two general
problems in an intuitive and efficient way under a graph-theoretical framework. A weighted state
transition graph and its time-expanded variants are developed, and the equivalence between the
FHOC problem and the shortest path problem in specific graphs is established rigorously. Two custom
algorithms are developed to find the shortest path and construct the optimal control sequence with
lower time complexity, though technically a classical shortest-path algorithm in graph theory
is sufficient for all problems. Compared with existing algebraic methods, our graph-theoretical
approach can achieve state-of-the-art time efficiency while targeting the most general problems.
Furthermore, our approach is the first one capable of solving Problem (ii) with time-variant costs.
Finally, the Ara operon genetic network in $\textit{E. coli}$ is used as a benchmark example to validate
the effectiveness of our approach, and the results of two tasks show that our approach can dramatically
reduce the running time.
