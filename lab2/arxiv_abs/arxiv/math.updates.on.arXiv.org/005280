The effective capacity (EC) has been recently established as a rigorous alternative to the classical
Shannon's ergodic capacity since it accounts for the delay constraints imposed by future wireless
applications and their impact on the overall system performance. This paper presents a novel moment
generating function (MGF)-based framework for the unified EC performance analysis of a generic
Lp-norm diversity combining scheme operating over arbitrary and correlated generalized fading
channels and a maximum delay constraint. The Lp-norm diversity is a generic diversity structure
which includes as special cases various well-known diversity schemes such as equal gain combining
(EGC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC). For MRC, the proposed methodology reduces to a previously
published MGF-based approach for the evaluation of the EC, whereas, for EGC, analytical approach
presented is novel and the associated performance evaluation results have not been published previously
in the open technical literature. Based on this methodology, novel analytical closed-form expressions
for the EC performance of dual branch Lp-norm diversity receivers operating over Gamma shadowed
generalized Nakagami-m fading channels are deduced. For diversity order greater than two, a novel
analytical approach for the asymptotic EC performance analysis is also developed and evaluated,
revealing how basic system parameters affect the overall system performance. The overall mathematical
formalism is validated with selected numerical and equivalent simulation performance evaluation
results thus confirming the correctness of the proposed unified analytical methodology.
