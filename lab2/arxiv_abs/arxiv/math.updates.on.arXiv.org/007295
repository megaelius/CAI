Equilibration to the steady state for a wide class of Luttinger liquid ballistic weakly linked tunnel
contacts is extensively studied. Quantum fluctuations of tunnel current are considered in all
orders in tunnel coupling and out of the equilibrium in the time domain. Especially, two important
mathematical statements: Self-equilibration (SE-)theorem and Self-equilibration (SE-)lemma
on the exact re-exponentiation of thermal average from the Keldysh-contour-ordered evolution
operator for arbitrary weakly linked Luttinger liquid tunnel contact are proven. Demonstrated
proof of SE-theorem and SE-lemma represents first evidence of a novel emergent phenomenon of "self-equilibration"
in the dynamics of quantum fluctuations of electron transport through ballistic tunnel junctions.
This phenomenon and all related real-time full counting statistics are shown to be much more general
as compared to the usual Levitov-Lesovik scattering approach for the non-interacting electrons,
though SE-theorem also contains known results obtained within the Levitov-Lesovik scattering
approach as corresponding limiting case for lowest order cumulants at $ g=1 $. As the result, corresponding
differential equation of "self-equilibration" for time-dependent Keldysh partition function
of tunnel contact is derived and explained. As the consequence of obtained results, a universal
character of self-equilibration of tunnel current in one-dimensional weakly linked tunnel junctions
is revealed and studied on the level of non-equilibrium Fano factor. As well, a new measure of disequilibrium
in such systems - the "steady flow" rate - is also introduced and discussed.
