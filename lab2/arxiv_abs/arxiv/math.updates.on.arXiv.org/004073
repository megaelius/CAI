In many power system optimization problems, we observe that only a small fraction of the line flow
constraints ever become active at the optimal solution, despite variations in the load profile
and generation costs. This observation has far-reaching implications not only for power system
optimization, but also for the practical long-term planning, operation, and control of the system.
We formalize this empirical observation for problems involving the DC power flow equations. We
use a two-step constraint screening approach to identify constraints whose satisfaction is implied
by other constraints in the problem, and can therefore be removed from the problem. For the first
screening step, we derive analytical bounds that quickly identify redundancies in the flow limits
on parallel lines. The second screening step uses optimization-based constraint screening, where
we solve a (relaxed) optimization problem for each constraint to identify redundancies. Different
from existing methods, we specifically focus our approach on large ranges of load variation such
that the results are valid for long periods of time, thus justifying the computational overhead
required for the screening method. Numerical results for a wide variety of standard test cases show
that even with load variations up to +/- 100% of nominal loading, we are able to eliminate a significant
fraction of the flow constraints. This large reduction in constraints may enable a range of possible
applications. As one illustrative example, we demonstrate the computational improvements for
the unit commitment problem obtained as a result of the reduced number of constraints.
