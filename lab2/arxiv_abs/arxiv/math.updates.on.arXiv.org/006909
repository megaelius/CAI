In this article, for generalized projective spaces with any weights, we prove four main theorems
in three different contexts where the Unital Set Condition USC (Definition $2.8$) on ideals is further
examined. In the first context we prove, in the first main Theorem $A$, the surjectivity of the Chinese
remainder reduction map associated to the generalized projective space of an ideal $\mathcal{I}=\underset{i=1}{\overset{k}{\prod}}\mathcal{I}_k$
with a given factorization into mutually co-maximal ideals $\mathcal{I}_j,1\leq j\leq k$ where
$\mathcal{I}$ satisfies the USC, using the key concept of choice multiplier hypothesis (Definition
$4.10$) which is satisfied. In the second context, for a positive $k$, we prove in the second main
Theorem $\Lambda$, the surjectivity of the reduction map $SP_{2k}(\mathcal{R})\rightarrow
SP_{2k}(\frac{\mathcal{R}}{\mathcal{I}})$ of strong approximation type for a ring $\mathcal{R}$
quotiented by an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ which satisfies the USC. In the third context, for a positive
integer $k$, we prove in the thrid main Theorem $\Omega$, the surjectivity of the map from special
linear group of degree $(k+1)$ to the product of generalized projective spaces of $(k+1)$-mutually
co-maximal ideals $\mathcal{I}_j,0\leq j\leq k$ associating the $(k+1)$-rows or $(k+1)$-columns,
where the ideal $\mathcal{I}=\underset{j=0}{\overset{k}{\prod}}\mathcal{I}_j$ satisfies
the USC. In the fourth main Theorem $\Sigma$, for a positive integer $k$, we prove the surjectivity
of the map from the symplectic group of degree $2k$ to the product of generalized projective spaces
of $(2k)$-mutually co-maximal ideals $\mathcal{I}_j,1\leq j\leq 2k$ associating the $(2k)$-rows
or $(2k)$-columns where the ideal $\mathcal{I}=\underset{j=1}{\overset{2k}{\prod}}\mathcal{I}_j$
satisfies the USC. The answers to Questions [1.1,1.2,1.3] in a greater generality are not known.
