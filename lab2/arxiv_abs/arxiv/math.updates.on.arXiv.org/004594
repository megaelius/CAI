A heterodimensional cycle consists of a pair of heteroclinic connections between two saddle periodic
orbits with unstable manifolds of different dimensions. Recent theoretical work on chaotic dynamics
beyond the uniformly hyperbolic setting has shown that heterodimensional cycles may occur robustly
in diffeomorphisms of dimension at least three. We study a concrete example of a heterodimensional
cycle in the continuous-time setting, specifically in a four-dimensional vector field model of
intracellular calcium dynamics. By employing advanced numerical techniques, Zhang, Krauskopf
and Kirk [Discr. Contin. Dynam. Syst. A 32(8) 2825--2851 (2012)] found that a heterodimensional
cycle exists in this model. We investigate the geometric structure of the associated stable and
unstable manifolds in the neighbourhood of this heterodimensional cycle, consisting of a single
connecting orbit of codimension one and an entire cylinder of structurally stable connecting orbits
between two saddle periodic orbits. We employ a boundary-value problem set-up to compute their
stable and unstable manifolds, which we visualize in different projections of phase space and as
intersection sets with a suitable three-dimensional Poincar\'e section. We show that, locally
near the intersection set of the heterodimensional cycle, the manifolds interact as described
by the theory for three-dimensional diffeomorphisms. On the other hand, their global structure
is more intricate, which is due to the fact that it is not possible to find a Poincar\'e section that
is transverse to the flow everywhere. Our results show that the abstract concept of a heterodimensional
cycle arises and can be studied in continuous-time models from applications.
