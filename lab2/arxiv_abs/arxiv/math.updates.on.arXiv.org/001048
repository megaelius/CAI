In this paper, we propose an adaptive fast solver for a general class of symmetric positive definite
(SPD) matrices which include the well-known graph Laplacian. We achieve this by developing an adaptive
operator compression scheme and a multiresolution matrix factorization algorithm which achieve
nearly optimal performance on both complexity and well-posedness. To develop our adaptive operator
compression and multiresolution matrix factorization methods, we first introduce a novel notion
of energy decomposition for SPD matrix $A$ using the representation of energy elements. The interaction
between these energy elements depicts the underlying topological structure of the operator. This
concept of decomposition naturally reflects the hidden geometric structure of the operator which
inherits the localities of the structure. By utilizing the intrinsic geometric information under
this Energy framework, we propose a systematic operator compression scheme for the inverse operator
$A^{-1}$. In particular, with an appropriate partition of the underlying geometric structure,
we can construct localized basis by using the concept of interior and closed energy. Meanwhile,
two important localized quantities are introduced, namely the error factor and the condition factor.
Our error analysis results show that these two factors will be the guidelines for finding the appropriate
partition of the basis functions such that prescribed compression error and acceptable condition
number can be achieved. By virtue of this insight, we propose the Patch Pairing algorithm to realize
our energy partition framework for operator compression with controllable compression error
and condition number.
