Let $D$ be a simple digraph (directed graph) with vertex set $V(D)$ and arc set $A(D)$ where $n=|V(D)|$,
and each arc is an ordered pair of distinct vertices. If $(v,u) \in A(D)$, then $u$ is considered an
out-neighbor of $v$ in $D$. Initially, we designate each vertex to be either filled or empty. Then,
the following color change rule (CCR) is applied: if a filled vertex $v$ has exactly one empty out-neighbor
$u$, then $u$ will be filled. The process continues until either all of the vertices in $V(D)$ are
filled, or the CCR restricts the remaining empty vertices from being filled. If all vertices in $V(D)$
are eventually filled, then the initial set is called a zero forcing set (ZFS); if not, it is a failed
zero forcing set (FZFS). We introduce the failed zero forcing number $\operatorname{F}(D)$ on
a digraph, which is the maximum cardinality of any FZFS. The zero forcing number, $\operatorname{Z}(D)$,
is the minimum cardinality of any ZFS. We characterize oriented graphs that have $\operatorname{F}(D)<\operatorname{Z}(D)$,
present a list of digraphs with the same property, and determine $\operatorname{F}(D)$ for several
classes of digraphs including directed acyclic graphs, weak paths and cycles, and weakly connected
line digraphs such as de Bruijn and Kautz graphs. We also characterize digraphs with $\operatorname{F}(D)=n-1$,
$\operatorname{F}(D)=n-2$, and $\operatorname{F}(D)=0$, which also gives us a characterization
of digraphs in which any vertex is a ZFS. Finally, we show that for any integer $n \geq 3$ and any non-negative
integer $k$ with $k <n$, there exists a weak cycle $D$ with $\operatorname{F}(D)=k$.
