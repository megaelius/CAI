Curiously, the predictions of the standard model of particle physics are highly successful in spite
of the fact that several parts of the underlying quantum field theoretical framework are analytically
problematic. Indeed, it has long been suggested, by Einstein, Schr\"odinger and others, that analytic
problems in the formulation of fundamental laws could be overcome by reformulating these laws without
reliance on analytic methods namely, for example, algebraically. In this spirit, we focus here
on the analytic ill-definedness of the quantum field theoretic Fourier and Legendre transforms
of the generating series of Feynman graphs, including the path integral. To this end, we develop
here purely algebraic and combinatorial formulations of the Fourier and Legendre transforms,
employing rings of formal power series. These are all-purpose transform methods, i.e., their applicability
is not restricted to QFT. When applied in QFT to the generating functionals of Feynman graphs, the
new transforms are well defined and thereby help explain the robustness and success of the predictions
of perturbative QFT in spite of analytic difficulties. Technically, we overcome here the problem
of the possible divergence of the various generating series of Feynman graphs by constructing Fourier
and Legendre transforms of formal power series that operate in a well defined way on the coefficients
of the power series irrespective of whether or not these series converge. In contrast, the use of
formal power series in QFT by Bogolubov, Hepp, Parasiuk and Zimmermann concerned a different kind
of divergencies, namely the UV divergencies of loop integrals and their renormalization. Our new
methods could provide new algebraic and combinatorial perspectives on QFT structures that are
conventionally thought of as analytic in nature, such as the occurrence of anomalies from the path
integral measure.
