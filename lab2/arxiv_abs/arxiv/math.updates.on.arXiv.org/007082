In this paper, we consider an eavesdropping attack on a multi-hop, UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Network
(UWASN) that consists of $M+1$ underwater sensors which report their sensed data via Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme to a sink node on the water surface. Furthermore,
due to the presence of a passive malicious node in nearby vicinity, the multi-hop UnderWater Acoustic
(UWA) channel between a sensor node and the sink node is prone to eavesdropping attack on each hop.
Therefore, the problem at hand is to do (helper/relay) node selection (for data forwarding onto
the next hop) as well as power allocation (across the OFDM sub-carriers) in a way that the secrecy
rate is maximized at each hop. To this end, this problem of Node Selection and Power Allocation (NSPA)
is formulated as a mixed binary-integer optimization program, which is then optimally solved via
decomposition approach, and by exploiting duality theory along with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
We also provide a computationally-efficient, sub-optimal solution to the NSPA problem, where
we reformulate it as a mixed-integer linear program and solve it via decomposition and geometric
approach. Moreover, when the UWA channel is multipath (and not just line-of-sight), we investigate
an additional, machine learning-based approach to solve the NSPA problem. Finally, we compute
the computational complexity of all the three proposed schemes (optimal, sub-optimal, and learning-based),
and do extensive simulations to compare their performance against each other and against the baseline
schemes (which allocate equal power to all the sub-carriers and do depth-based node selection).
In a nutshell, this work proposes various (optimal and sub-optimal) methods for providing information-theoretic
security at the physical layer of the protocol stack through resource allocation.
