In the Directed Disjoint Paths problem, we are given a digraph $D$ and a set of requests $\{(s_1, t_1),
\ldots, (s_k, t_k)\}$, and the task is to find a collection of pairwise vertex-disjoint paths $\{P_1,
\ldots, P_k\}$ such that each $P_i$ is a path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ in $D$. This problem is NP-complete
for fixed $k=2$ and W[1]-hard with parameter $k$ in DAGs. A few positive results are known under restrictions
on the input digraph, such as being planar or having bounded directed tree-width, or under relaxations
of the problem, such as allowing for vertex congestion. Good news are scarce, however, for general
digraphs. In this article we propose a novel global congestion metric for the problem: we only require
the paths to be "disjoint enough", in the sense that they must behave properly not in the whole graph,
but in an unspecified large part of it. Namely, in the Disjoint Enough Directed Paths problem, given
an $n$-vertex digraph $D$, a set of $k$ requests, and non-negative integers $d$ and $s$, the task
is to find a collection of paths connecting the requests such that at least $d$ vertices of $D$ occur
in at most $s$ paths of the collection. We study the parameterized complexity of this problem for
a number of choices of the parameter, including the directed tree-width of $D$. Among other results,
we show that the problem is W[1]-hard in DAGs with parameter $d$ and, on the positive side, we give
an algorithm in time $O(n^d \cdot k^{d\cdot s})$ and a kernel of size $d \cdot 2^{k-s}\cdot \binom{k}{s}
+ 2k$ in general digraphs. The latter result, which is our main contribution, has consequences for
the Steiner Network problem.
