Large matrix multiplications are central to large-scale machine learning applications. These
operations are often carried out on a distributed computing platform with a master server and multiple
workers in the cloud operating in parallel. For such distributed platforms, it has been recently
shown that coding over the input data matrices can reduce the computational delay, yielding a trade-off
between recovery threshold, i.e., the number of workers required to recover the matrix product,
and communication load, i.e., the total amount of data to be downloaded from the workers. In this
paper, in addition to exact recovery requirements, we impose security and privacy constraints
on the data matrices, and study the recovery threshold as a function of the communication load. We
first assume that both matrices contain private information and that workers can collude to eavesdrop
on the content of these data matrices. For this problem, we introduce a novel class of secure codes,
referred to as secure generalized PolyDot (SGPD) codes, that generalize state-of-the-art non-secure
codes for matrix multiplication. SGPD codes allow a flexible trade-off between recovery threshold
and communication load for a fixed maximum number of colluding workers while providing perfect
secrecy for the two data matrices. We then study a connection between secure matrix multiplication
and private information retrieval. We specifically assume that one of the data matrices is taken
from a public set known to all the workers. In this setup, the identity of the matrix of interest should
be kept private from the workers. For this model, we present a variant of generalized PolyDot codes
that can guarantee both secrecy of one matrix and privacy for the identity of the other matrix for
the case of no colluding servers.
