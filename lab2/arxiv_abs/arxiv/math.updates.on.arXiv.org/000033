This paper studies the achievable rates of Gaussian interference channels with additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN), when improper or circularly asymmetric complex Gaussian signaling is applied.
For the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output interference channel (MIMO-IC) with the interference
treated as Gaussian noise, we show that the user's achievable rate can be expressed as a summation
of the rate achievable by the conventional proper or circularly symmetric complex Gaussian signaling
in terms of the users' transmit covariance matrices, and an additional term, which is a function
of both the users' transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices. The additional degrees
of freedom in the pseudo-covariance matrix, which is conventionally set to be zero for the case of
proper Gaussian signaling, provide an opportunity to further improve the achievable rates of Gaussian
MIMO-ICs by employing improper Gaussian signaling. To this end, this paper proposes widely linear
precoding, which efficiently maps proper information-bearing signals to improper transmitted
signals at each transmitter for any given pair of transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices.
In particular, for the case of two-user Gaussian single-input single-output interference channel
(SISO-IC), we propose a joint covariance and pseudo-covariance optimization algorithm with improper
Gaussian signaling to achieve the Pareto-optimal rates. By utilizing the separable structure
of the achievable rate expression, an alternative algorithm with separate covariance and pseudo-covariance
optimization is also proposed, which guarantees the rate improvement over conventional proper
Gaussian signaling.
