In this paper we introduce a generalized Sobolev space by defining a semi-inner product formulated
in terms of a vector distributional operator $\mathbf{P}$ consisting of finitely or countably
many distributional operators $P_n$, which are defined on the dual space of the Schwartz space.
The types of operators we consider include not only differential operators, but also more general
distributional operators such as pseudo-differential operators. We deduce that a certain appropriate
full-space Green function $G$ with respect to $L:=\mathbf{P}^{\ast T}\mathbf{P}$ now becomes
a conditionally positive definite function. In order to support this claim we ensure that the distributional
adjoint operator $\mathbf{P}^{\ast}$ of $\mathbf{P}$ is well-defined in the distributional
sense. Under sufficient conditions, the native space (reproducing-kernel Hilbert space) associated
with the Green function $G$ can be isometrically embedded into or even be isometrically equivalent
to a generalized Sobolev space. As an application, we take linear combinations of translates of
the Green function with possibly added polynomial terms and construct a multivariate minimum-norm
interpolant $s_{f,X}$ to data values sampled from an unknown generalized Sobolev function $f$
at data sites located in some set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We provide several examples, such as
Mat\'ern kernels or Gaussian kernels, that illustrate how many reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces
of well-known reproducing kernels are isometrically equivalent to a generalized Sobolev space.
These examples further illustrate how we can rescale the Sobolev spaces by the vector distributional
operator $\mathbf{P}$. Introducing the notion of scale as part of the definition of a generalized
Sobolev space may help us to choose the "best" kernel function for kernel-based approximation methods.
