This article presents two novel adaptive-sparse polynomial dimensional decomposition (PDD)
methods for solving high-dimensional uncertainty quantification problems in computational
science and engineering. The methods entail global sensitivity analysis for retaining important
PDD component functions, and a full- or sparse-grid dimension-reduction integration or quasi
Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the PDD expansion coefficients. A unified algorithm, endowed
with two distinct ranking schemes for grading component functions, was created for their numerical
implementation. The fully adaptive-sparse PDD method is comprehensive and rigorous, leading
to the second-moment statistics of a stochastic response that converges to the exact solution when
the tolerances vanish. A partially adaptive-sparse PDD method, obtained through regulated adaptivity
and sparsity, is economical and is, therefore, expected to solve practical problems with numerous
variables. Compared with past developments, the adaptive-sparse PDD methods do not require its
truncation parameter(s) to be assigned \emph{a priori} or arbitrarily. The numerical results
reveal that an adaptive-sparse PDD method achieves a desired level of accuracy with considerably
fewer coefficients compared with existing PDD approximations. For a required accuracy in calculating
the probabilistic response characteristics, the new bivariate adaptive-sparse PDD method is
more efficient than the existing bivariately truncated PDD method by almost an order of magnitude.
Finally, stochastic dynamic analysis of a disk brake system was performed, demonstrating the ability
of the new methods to tackle practical engineering problems.
