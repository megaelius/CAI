Kinetically constrained models (KCM) are reversible interacting particle systems on $\mathbb
Z^d$ with continuous time Markov dynamics of Glauber type, which represent a natural stochastic
(and non-monotone) counterpart of the family of cellular automata known as $\mathcal U$-bootstrap
percolation. KCM also display some of the peculiar features of the so-called "glassy dynamics",
and as such they are extensively used in the physics literature to model the liquid-glass transition,
a major and longstanding open problem in condensed matter physics. We consider two-dimensional
KCM with update rule $\mathcal U$, and focus on proving universality results for the mean infection
time of the origin, in the same spirit as those recently established in the setting of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap
percolation. We first identify what we believe are the correct universality classes, which turn
out to be different from those of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. We then prove universal upper
bounds on the mean infection time within each class, which we conjecture to be sharp up to logarithmic
corrections. In certain cases, including all supercritical models, and the well-known Duarte
model, our conjecture has recently been confirmed in [MMT]. In fact, in these cases our upper bound
is sharp up to a constant factor in the exponent. For certain classes of update rules, it turns out
that the infection time of the KCM diverges much faster than for the corresponding $\mathcal U$-bootstrap
process when the equilibrium density of infected sites goes to zero. This is due to the occurrence
of energy barriers which determine the dominant behaviour for KCM, but which do not matter for the
monotone bootstrap dynamics.
