In this work we propose a high-order discretization of the Baer-Nunziato two-phase flow model (Baer
and Nunziato, Int. J. Multiphase Flow, 12 (1986), pp. 861-889) with closures for interface velocity
and pressure adapted to the treatment of discontinuous solutions, and stiffened gas equations
of states. We use the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM), based on collocation
of quadrature and interpolation points (Kopriva and Gassner, J. Sci. Comput., 44 (2010), pp. 136-155).
The DGSEM uses summation-by-parts (SBP) operators in the numerical quadrature for approximating
the integrals over discretization elements (Carpenter et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 36 (2014),
pp. B835-B867; Gassner et al., J. Comput. Phys., 327 (2016), pp. 39-66). Here, we build upon the framework
provided in (F. Renac, J. Comput. Phys., 382 (2019), pp. 1-36) for nonconservative hyperbolic systems
to modify the integration over cell elements using the SBP operators and replace the physical fluxes
with entropy conservative fluctuation fluxes from Castro et al. (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013),
pp. 1371-1391), while we derive entropy stable fluxes applied at interfaces. This allows to establish
a semi-discrete inequality for the cell-averaged physical entropy, while being high-order accurate.
The design of the numerical fluxes also formally preserves the kinetic energy at the semi-discrete
level. High-order integration in time is performed using strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta
schemes and we propose conditions on the numerical parameters for the positivity of the cell-averaged
void fraction and partial densities. The positivity of the cell-averaged solution is extended
to nodal values by the use of an a posteriori limiter. The high-order accuracy, nonlinear stability,
and robustness of the present scheme are assessed through several numerical experiments in one
and two space dimensions.
