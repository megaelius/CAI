We study the role of coded side information in single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR).
An instance of the single-server PIR problem includes a server that stores a database of $K$ independently
and uniformly distributed messages, and a user who wants to retrieve one of these messages from the
server. We consider settings in which the user initially has access to a coded side information which
includes a linear combination of a subset of $M$ messages in the database. We assume that the identities
of the $M$ messages that form the support set of the coded side information as well as the coding coefficients
are initially unknown to the server. We consider two different models, depending on whether the
support set of the coded side information includes the requested message or not. We also consider
the following two privacy requirements: (i) the identities of both the demand and the support set
of the coded side information need to be protected, or (ii) only the identity of the demand needs to
be protected. For each model and for each of the privacy requirements, we consider the problem of
designing a protocol for generating the user's query and the server's answer that enables the user
to decode the message they need while satisfying the privacy requirement. We characterize the (scalar-linear)
capacity of each setting, defined as the ratio of the number of information bits in a message to the
minimum number of information bits downloaded from the server over all (scalar-linear) protocols
that satisfy the privacy condition. Our converse proofs rely on new information-theoretic arguments---tailored
to the setting of single-server PIR and different from the commonly-used techniques in multi-server
PIR settings. We also present novel capacity-achieving scalar-linear protocols for each of the
settings being considered.
