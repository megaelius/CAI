We introduce bimonads in a 2-category $\K$ and define biwreaths as bimonads in the 2-category $\bEM(\K)$
of bimonads, in the analogous fashion as Lack and Street defined wreaths. A biwreath is then a system
containing a wreath, a cowreath and their mixed versions, but also a 2-cell $\lambda$ in $\bEM(\K)$
governing the compatibility of the monad and the comonad structure of the biwreath. We deduce that
the monad laws encode 2-(co)cycles and the comonad laws so called 3-(co)cycles, while the 2-cell
conditions of the (co)monad structure 2-cells of the biwreath encode (co)actions twisted by these
2- and 3-(co)cycles. The compatibilities of $\lambda$ deliver concrete expressions of the latter
structure 2-cells. We concentrate on the examples of biwreaths in the 2-category induced by a braided
monoidal category $\C$ and take for the distributive laws in a biwreath the braidings of the different
categories of Yetter-Drinfel'd modules in $\C$. We prove that the before-mentioned properties
of a biwreath specified to the latter setting recover on the level of $\C$ different algebraic constructions
known in the category ${}_R\M$ of modules over a commutative ring $R$, such as Radford biproduct,
Sweedler's crossed product algebra, comodule algebras over a quasi-bialgebra and the Drinfel'd
twist. In this way we obtain that the known examples of (mixed) wreaths coming from ${}_R\M$ are not
merely examples, rather they are consequences of the structure of a biwreath, and that the form of
their structure morphisms originates in the laws inside of a biwreath. Choosing different distributive
laws and different 2-cells $\lambda$ in a biwreath, leads to different and possibly new algebraic
constructions.
