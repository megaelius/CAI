We study two polynomially convex domains in $\mathbb C^n$. The first domain is the symmetrized-$n-$disk
for $n\geq 2$, which is the following subset of $\mathbb C^n$: \[ \mathbb G_n :=\left\{ \left(\sum_{1\leq
i\leq n} z_i,\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n}z_iz_j \dots, \prod_{i=1}^n z_i \right): \,z_i \in \D, i=1,\dots,n
\right \}, \] where $\mathbb D$ denotes the open unit disc in the complex plane. The second domain
is the extended symmetrized polydisc $\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$, which we define in the following
way: \begin{align*} \widetilde{\mathbb G}_n := \Bigg\{ (y_1,\dots,y_{n-1}, q)\in \mathbb C^n
:\; q \in \mathbb D, \; y_j = \beta_j + \bar \beta_{n-j} q, \; \beta_j \in \C &\text{ and }\\ |\beta_j|+
|\beta_{n-j}| < {n \choose j} &\text{ for } j=1,\dots, n-1 \Bigg\}. \end{align*} We show that ${\mathbb
G}_n \subset \widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$. We study the complex geometry of the extended symmetrized
polydisc $\mathbb G_n$ and obtain a variety of characterizations for the points in $\widetilde{\mathbb
G}_n$ and $\overline{\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n}$. As a consequence we get a similar set of characterizations
for the symmetrized polydisc $\mathbb G_n$ and $\overline{\mathbb G_n}$. We find several other
geometric properties of $\widetilde{\mathbb G_n}$ and $\mathbb G_n$. We make some sharp estimates
to prove a Schwarz type lemma for $\widetilde{\mathbb G_n}$ from which a Schwarz type lemma for $\mathbb
G_n$ follows. The conditions obtained in the Schwarz lemma for $\widetilde{\mathbb G_n}$ and $\mathbb
G_n$ are necessary conditions for the existence of a two-point interpolating function from $\mathbb
D$ to $\widetilde{\mathbb G_n}$ and $\mathbb G_n$. For $n=3$, we show that these conditions are
sufficient for $\widetilde{\mathbb G_n}$ too. We describe all such interpolating functions from
$\mathbb D$ to $\widetilde{\mathbb G_n}$ for $n=3$.
