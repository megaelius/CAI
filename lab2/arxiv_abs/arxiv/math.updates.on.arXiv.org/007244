This article aims at developing a high order pressure-based solver for the solution of the 3D compressible
Navier-Stokes system at all Mach numbers. We propose a cell-centered discretization of the governing
equations that splits the fluxes into a fast and a slow scale part, that are treated implicitly and
explicitly, respectively. A novel semi-implicit discretization is proposed for the kinetic energy
as well as the enthalpy fluxes in the energy equation, hence avoiding any need of iterative solvers.
The implicit discretization yields an elliptic equation on the pressure that can be solved for both
ideal gas and general equation of state (EOS). A nested Newton method is used to solve the mildly nonlinear
system for the pressure in case of nonlinear EOS. High order in time is granted by implicit-explicit
(IMEX) time stepping, whereas a novel CWENO technique efficiently implemented in a dimension-by-dimension
manner is developed for achieving high order in space for the discretization of explicit convective
and viscous fluxes. A quadrature-free finite volume solver is then derived for the high order approximation
of numerical fluxes. Central schemes with no dissipation of suitable order of accuracy are finally
employed for the numerical approximation of the implicit terms. Consequently, the CFL-type stability
condition on the maximum admissible time step is based only on the fluid velocity and not on the sound
speed, so that the novel schemes work uniformly for all Mach numbers. Convergence and robustness
of the proposed method are assessed through a wide set of benchmark problems involving low and high
Mach number regimes, as well as inviscid and viscous flows.
