We consider a natural class of $\mathbf{R}^d$-valued one-dimensional stochastic PDEs driven
by space-time white noise that is formally invariant under the action of the diffeomorphism group
on $\mathbf{R}^d$. This class contains in particular the KPZ equation, the multiplicative stochastic
heat equation, the additive stochastic heat equation, and rough Burgers-type equations. We exhibit
a one-parameter family of solution theories with the following properties: - For all SPDEs in our
class for which a solution was previously available, every solution in our family coincides with
the previously constructed solution, whether that was obtained using It\^o calculus (additive
and multiplicative stochastic heat equation), rough path theory (rough Burgers-type equations),
or the Hopf-Cole transform (KPZ equation). - Every solution theory is equivariant under the action
of the diffeomorphism group, i.e. identities obtained by formal calculations treating the noise
as a smooth function are valid. - Every solution theory satisfies an analogue of It\^o's isometry.
- The counterterms leading to our solution theories vanish at points where the equation agrees to
leading order with the additive stochastic heat equation. In particular, points 2 and 3 show that,
surprisingly, our solution theories enjoy properties analogous to those holding for both the Stratonovich
and It\^o interpretations of SDEs simultaneously. For the natural noisy perturbation of the harmonic
map flow with values in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, we show that all these solution theories
coincide. In particular, this allows us to conjecturally identify the process associated to the
Markov extension of the Dirichlet form corresponding to the $L^2$-gradient flow for the Brownian
bridge measure.
