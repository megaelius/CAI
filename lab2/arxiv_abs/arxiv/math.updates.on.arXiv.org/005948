A correspondence is established between measure-preserving, ergodic dynamics of a classical
harmonic oscillator and a quantum mechanical gauge theory on two-dimensional Minkowski space.
This correspondence is realized through an isometric embedding of the $L^2(\mu)$ space on the circle
associated with the oscillator's invariant measure, $ \mu $, into a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$
of sections of a $\mathbb{C}$-line bundle over Minkowski space. This bundle is equipped with a covariant
derivative induced from an SO$^+$(1,1) gauge field (connection 1-form) on the corresponding inertial
frame bundle, satisfying the Yang-Mills equations. Under this embedding, the Hamiltonian operator
of a Lorentz-invariant quantum system, constructed as a natural Laplace-type operator on bundle
sections, pulls back to the generator of the unitary group of Koopman operators governing the evolution
of classical observables of the harmonic oscillator, with Koopman eigenfunctions of zero, positive,
and negative eigenfrequency corresponding to quantum eigenstates of zero ("vacuum"), positive
("matter"), and negative ("antimatter") energy. The embedding also induces a pair of operators
acting on classical observables of the harmonic oscillator, exhibiting canonical position-momentum
commutation relationships. These operators have the structure of order-$1/2$ fractional derivatives,
and therefore display a form of non-locality. In a second part of this work, we study a quantum mechanical
representation of the classical harmonic oscillator using a one-parameter family of reproducing
kernel Hilbert algebras associated with the transition kernel of a fractional diffusion on the
circle, where a stronger notion of classical-quantum consistency is established than in the $L^2(\mu)$
case.
