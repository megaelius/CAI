We study dynamical transportation networks in a framework that includes extensions of the classical
Cell Transmission Model to arbitrary network topologies. The dynamics are modeled as systems of
ordinary differential equations describing the traffic flow among a finite number of cells interpreted
as links of a directed network. Flows between contiguous cells, in particular at junctions, are
determined by merging and splitting rules within constraints imposed by the cells' demand and supply
functions as well as by the drivers' turning preferences, while inflows at on-ramps are modeled
as exogenous and possibly time-varying. First, we analyze stability properties of dynamical transportation
networks. We associate to the dynamics a state-dependent dual graph whose connectivity depends
on the signs of the derivatives of the inter-cell flows with respect to the densities. Sufficient
conditions for the stability of equilibria and periodic solutions are then provided in terms of
the connectivity of such dual graph. Then, we consider synthesis of control policies that use a combination
of turning preferences, speed limits, and ramp metering, in order to optimize convex objectives.
We first show that, in the general case, the optimal control synthesis problem can be cast as a convex
optimization problem, and that the equilibrium of the controlled network is in free-flow. If the
control policies are restricted to speed limits and ramp metering, then the resulting synthesis
problem is still convex for networks where every node is either a merge or a diverge junction, and
where the dynamics is monotone. These results apply both to the optimal selection of equilibria
and periodic solutions, as well as to finite-horizon network trajectory optimization. Finally,
we illustrate our findings through simulations on a road network inspired by the freeway system
in southern Los Angeles.
