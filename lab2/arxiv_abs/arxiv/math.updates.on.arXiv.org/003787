formality theorem states that there exists an $L_\infty$ quasi-isomorphism from the dgla $T\poly(M)$
of polyvector fields on a smooth manifold $M$ to the dgla $D\poly(M)$ of polydifferential operators
on $M$, which extends the classical Hochschild--Kostant--Rosenberg map. In this paper, we extend
Kontsevich's formality theorem to Lie pairs, a framework which includes a range of diverse geometric
contexts such as complex manifolds, foliations, and $\mathfrak{g}$-manifolds. The spaces $\cx{T}$
and $\cx{D}$ associated with a Lie pair $(L,A)$ each carry an $L_\infty$ algebra structure canonical
up to $L_\infty$ isomorphism. These two spaces serve as replacements for the spaces of polyvector
fields and polydifferential operators, respectively. Their corresponding cohomology groups
$\cy{T}$ and $\cy{D}$ admit canonical Gerstenhaber algebra structures. We establish the following
formality theorem for Lie pairs: there exists an $L_\infty$ quasi isomorphism from $\cx{T}$ to
$\cx{D}$ whose first Taylor coefficient is equal to $\operatorname{hkr}\circ\td$. Here $\td$
acts on $\cx{T}$ by contraction. Furthermore, we prove a Kontsevich--Duflo type theorem for Lie
pairs: the Hochschild--Kostant--Rosenberg map twisted by the square root of the Todd class of the
Lie pair $(L,A)$ is an isomorphism of Gerstenhaber algebras from $\cy{T}$ to $\cy{D}$. As applications,
we establish formality theorems and Kontsevich--Duflo type theorems for complex manifolds, foliations,
and $\mathfrak{g}$-manifolds. In the case of complex manifolds, we recover the Kontsevich--Duflo
theorem of complex geometry.
