In the study of Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles, it is natural to perturb Hamiltoni-ans
by adding potentials (functions depending only on the base point). This led to the definition of
Ma{\~n}{\'e} genericity: a property is generic if, given a Hamiltonian H, the set of potentials
u such that H + u satisfies the property is generic. This notion is mostly used in the context of Hamiltonians
which are convex in p, in the sense that $\partial$ 2 pp H is positive definite at each points. We will
also restrict our study to this situation. There is a close relation between perturbations of Hamiltonians
by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one. Indeed, the Hamiltonians
H + u and H/(1 -- u) have the same level one energy surface, hence their dynamics on this energy surface
are reparametrisation of each other, this is the Maupertuis principle. This remark is particularly
relevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler metrics) or even fiberwise
quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics). In these cases, perturbations by potentials
of the Hamiltonian correspond, up to parametrisation, to conformal perturbations of the metric.
One of the widely studied aspects is to understand to what extent the return map associated to a periodic
orbit can be perturbed by adding a small potential. This kind of question depend strongly on the context
in which they are posed. Some of the most studied contexts are, in increasing order of difficulty,
perturbations of general vector fields, perturbations of Hamiltonian systems inside the class
of Hamiltonian systems, perturbations of Riemannian metrics inside the class of Riemannian metrics,
Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians. It is for example well-known that each vector
field can be perturbed to a vector field with only hyperbolic periodic orbits, this is part of the
Kupka-Smale theorem, see [5, 13]. There is no such result in the context of Hamiltonian vector fields,
but it remains true that each Hamiltonian can be perturbed to a Hamiltonian with only non-degenerate
periodic orbits (including the iterated ones), see [11, 12]. The same result is true in the context
of Riemannian metrics: every Riemannian metric can be perturbed to a Riemannian metric with only
non-degenerate closed geodesics, this is the bumpy metric theorem, see [4, 2, 1]. The question was
investigated only much more recently in the context of Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians,
see [9, 10]. It is proved in [10] that the same result holds : If H is a convex Hamiltonian and a is a regular
value of H, then there exist arbitrarily small potentials u such that all periodic orbits (including
iterated ones) of H + u at energy a are non-degenerate. The proof given in [10] is actually rather similar
to the ones given in papers on the perturbations of Riemannian metrics. In all these proofs, it is
very useful to work
