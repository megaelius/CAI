In this study, we propose an effective numerical approach to analyse and control geometrically
nonlinear responses for the functionally graded (FG) porous plates reinforced by graphene platelets
(GPLs) integrated with piezoelectric layers. The basis idea is to use isogeometric analysis (IGA)
based on the B\'ezier extraction and the $C^0$-type higher-order shear deformation theory ($C^0$-HSDT).
By applying the B\'ezier extraction, the original Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) control
meshes can be transformed into the B\'ezier elements which allow us to inherit the standard numerical
procedure like the finite element method (FEM). The mechanical displacement field is approximated
based on the $C^0$-HSDT whilst the electric potential is assumed to be a linear function through
the thickness of each piezoelectric sublayer. The FG plate contains the internal pores and GPLs
dispersed in the metal matrix either uniformly or non-uniformly according to various different
patterns along the thickness of plate. In addition, to control dynamic responses, two piezoelectric
layers are perfectly bonded on the top and bottom surfaces of the FG plate. The geometrically nonlinear
equations are solved by the Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and the Newmark's time integration
scheme. The influences of the porosity coefficients, weight fractions of GPLs as well as the external
electrical voltage on the geometrically nonlinear behaviours of the plates with different porosity
distributions and GPL dispersion patterns are evidently investigated through numerical examples.
Then, a constant displacement and velocity feedback control approaches are adopted to active control
the geometrically nonlinear static as well as the dynamic responses of the FG porous plates, where
the effect of the structural damping is considered, based on a closed-loop control with piezoelectric
sensors and actuators.
