In this paper we study the existence of multiple solutions for the non-Abelian Chern--Simons--Higgs
$(N\times N)$-system: \[ \Delta u_i=\lambda\left(\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^N K_{kj}K_{ji}\re^{u_j}\re^{u_k}-\sum_{j=1}^N
K_{ji}\re^{u_j}\right)+4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\delta_{p_{ij}},\quad i=1,\dots, N; \] over
a doubly periodic domain $\Omega$, with coupling matrix $K$ given by the Cartan matrix of $SU(N+1),$
(see \eqref{k1} below). Here, $\lambda>0$ is the coupling parameter, $\delta_p$ is the Dirac measure
with pole at $p$ and $n_i\in \mathbb{N},$ for $i=1, \dots, N.$ When $N=1, 2$ many results are now available
for the periodic solvability of such system and provide the existence of different classes of solutions
known as: topological, non-topological, mixed and blow-up type. On the contrary for $N\ge 3,$ only
recently in \cite{haya1} the authors managed to obtain the existence of one doubly periodic solution
via a minimisation procedure, in the spirit of \cite{nota} . Our main contribution in this paper
is to show (as in \cite{nota}) that actually the given system admits a second doubly periodic solutions
of "Mountain-pass" type, provided that $3\le N\le 5$. Note that the existence of multiple solutions
is relevant from the physical point of view. Indeed, it implies the co-existence of different non-Abelian
Chern--Simons condensates sharing the same set (assigned component-wise) of vortex points, energy
and fluxes. The main difficulty to overcome is to attain a "compactness" property encompassed by
the so called Palais--Smale condition for the corresponding "action" functional, whose validity
remains still open for $N\ge 6$.
