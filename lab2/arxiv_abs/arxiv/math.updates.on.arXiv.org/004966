We prove a series of results tied to the regularity and geometry of solutions to the $3D$ compressible
Euler equations with vorticity and entropy. Our framework exploits and reveals additional virtues
of a recent new formulation of the equations, which decomposed the flow into a geometric "(sound)
wave-part" coupled to a "transport-div-curl-part" (transport-part for short), with both parts
exhibiting remarkable properties. Our main result is that the time of existence can be controlled
in terms of the $H^{2^+}(\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm of the wave-part of the initial data and various Sobolev
and H\"{o}lder norms of the transport-part of the initial data, the latter comprising the initial
vorticity and entropy. The wave-part regularity assumptions are optimal in the scale of Sobolev
spaces: shocks can instantly form if one only assumes a bound for the $H^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm
of the wave-part of the initial data. Our proof relies on the assumption that the transport-part
of the initial data is more regular than the wave-part, and we show that the additional regularity
is propagated by the flow, even though the transport-part of the flow is deeply coupled to the rougher
wave-part. To implement our approach, we derive several results of independent interest: i) sharp
estimates for the acoustic geometry, i.e., the geometry of sound cones; ii) Strichartz estimates
for quasilinear sound waves coupled to vorticity and entropy; and iii) Schauder estimates for the
transport-div-curl-part. Compared to previous works on low regularity, the main new features
of the paper are that the quasilinear PDE systems under study exhibit multiple speeds of propagation
and that elliptic estimates for various components of the fluid are needed, both to avoid loss of
regularity and to gain space-time integrability.
