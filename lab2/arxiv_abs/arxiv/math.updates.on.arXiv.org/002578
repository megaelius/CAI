Regularized inversion methods for image reconstruction are used widely due to their tractability
and ability to combine complex physical sensor models with useful regularity criteria. Such methods
motivated the recently developed Plug-and-Play prior method, which provides a framework to use
advanced denoising algorithms as regularizers in inversion. However, the need to formulate regularized
inversion as the solution to an optimization problem limits the possible regularity conditions
and physical sensor models. In this paper, we introduce Consensus Equilibrium (CE), which generalizes
regularized inversion to include a much wider variety of both forward components and prior components
without the need for either to be expressed with a cost function. CE is based on the solution of a set
of equilibrium equations that balance data fit and regularity. In this framework, the problem of
MAP estimation in regularized inversion is replaced by the problem of solving these equilibrium
equations, which can be approached in multiple ways. The key contribution of CE is to provide a novel
framework for fusing multiple heterogeneous models of physical sensors or models learned from
data. We describe the derivation of the CE equations and prove that the solution of the CE equations
generalizes the standard MAP estimate under appropriate circumstances. We also discuss algorithms
for solving the CE equations, including ADMM with a novel form of preconditioning and Newton's method.
We give examples to illustrate consensus equilibrium and the convergence properties of these algorithms
and demonstrate this method on some toy problems and on a denoising example in which we use an array
of convolutional neural network denoisers, none of which is tuned to match the noise level in a noisy
image but which in consensus can achieve a better result than any of them individually.
