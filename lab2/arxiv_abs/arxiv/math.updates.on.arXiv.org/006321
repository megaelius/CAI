This paper introduces a sharp interface method to simulate fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
involving arbitrary rigid bodies immersed in viscous incompressible fluids. This approach, which
we refer to as an immersed Lagrangian-Eulerian (ILE) method, integrates aspects of partitioned
and immersed FSI formulations by solving separate momentum equations for the fluid and solid domains,
as in a partitioned formulation, while also using non-conforming discretizations of the moving
fluid and structure, as in an immersed formulation. A Dirichlet-Neumann coupling scheme is used,
in which the motion of the immersed solid is driven by fluid traction forces evaluated along the fluid-structure
interface, and the motion of fluid along that interface is constrained to match the solid velocity,
so as to enforce the no-slip condition. We introduce a penalty approach that weakly imposes the no-slip
condition along the fluid-solid interface. In the coupling strategy, a separate discretization
of the fluid-structure interface is tethered to the volumetric solid mesh via stiff spring-like
penalty forces. Our fluid-structure interaction scheme relies on a recently developed immersed
interface method for discrete geometries, which enables the accurate determination of both velocities
and stresses along the fluid-structure interface. The effectiveness of this straightforward
FSI methodology is extensively tested against benchmark computational and experimental studies
in two and three spatial dimensions, including for geometries with non-smooth features. Unlike
commonly used partitioned methods, which can suffer from so-called added mass effect instabilities,
our methodology avoids subiterations between fluid and solid solvers or complex handling of the
fluid pressure, and it retains stability for models involving extremely low, nearly equal, equal,
and high solid-fluid density ratios.
