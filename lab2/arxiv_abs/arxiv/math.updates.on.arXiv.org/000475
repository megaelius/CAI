Following M. Tsujii, for, $0<\lambda<1$, consider the transformation $T(x) = d x $ (mod 1)
on the circle $S^1$, and, the map $F(x,s) = (T(x), \lambda \, s + A(x))$, $(x,s)\in S^1 \times \mathbb{R}$.
This transformation $F$ (which is not bijective) defines an attractor set and its dynamics is similar
to the solenoid. For each value $\lambda$ the attractor is the set of points which have a bounded set
of pre-images (of arbitrary order). For each $\lambda$ one can consider $\lambda$-maximizing
probabilities and this is an important ingredient in the proof of our main results. We denote $\mathcal{B}=
\mathcal{B}_\lambda$ the upper boundary of the attractor. We are interested in probabilities
on $\mathcal{B}_\lambda$, and, what happen in the limit when $\lambda\to 1$. From another point
of view, the topological one, it is natural to try to understand the regularity of this boundary.
We use in an essential way several results which are taken from Ergodic Transport Theory and also
an involution kernel. We also address the analysis of following conjecture which were proposed
by R. Bam\on, J. Kiwi, J. Rivera-Letelier and R. Urzua: for any fixed $\lambda$, generically $C^1$
on the potential $A$, the upper boundary $\mathcal{B}_\lambda$ is formed by a finite number of pieces
of smooth unstable manifolds of periodic orbits for $F$. We prove the conjecture in the sense that
for a generic (twist) $C^1$ potential there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that in the interval $(1-\epsilon,1)$
the $\lambda-$maximizing probability is a periodic orbit. As we will see this proves the conjecture
for a generic twist $A$ for $\lambda \in (1-\epsilon,1)$. We show in the last section an specific
analysis of the conjecture for any $\lambda\in(0,1]$ for the smooth case when $A(x)$ is quadratic.
