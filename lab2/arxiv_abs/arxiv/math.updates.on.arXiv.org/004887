This article studies the bundle of Weyl structures associated to a parabolic geometry. Given a parabolic
geometry of any type on a smooth manifold $M$, this is a natural bundle $A\to M$, whose smooth sections
can be identified with Weyl structures for the geometry. We show that the initial parabolic geometry
defines a reductive Cartan geometry on $A$, which induces an almost bi-Lagrangian structure on
$A$ and a compatible linear connection on $TA$. In the first part of the article, we prove that all
elements of the theory of Weyl structures can be interpreted in terms of natural geometric operations
on $A$. In the second part of the article, we turn our point of view around and use the relation to parabolic
geometries and Weyl structures to study the intrinsic geometry on $A$. This geometry is rather exotic
outside of the class of torsion free parabolic geometries associated to a $|1|$-grading (i.e. AHS
structures), to which we restrict for the rest of the article. We prove that the split-signature
metric provided by the almost bi-Lagrangian structure is always Einstein. We proceed to study Weyl
structures via the submanifold geometry of the image of the corresponding section in $A$. For Weyl
structures satisfying appropriate non-degeneracy conditions, we derive a universal formula
for the second fundamental form of this image. In the last part of the article, we show that for locally
flat projective structures, this has close relations to solutions of a projectively invariant
Monge-Amp\`ere equation and thus to properly convex projective structures. Analogs for other
AHS structures are indicated at the end of the article.
