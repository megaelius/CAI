We consider non-linear time-fractional stochastic heat type equation $$\frac{\partial^\beta
u}{\partial t^\beta}+\nu(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} u=I^{1-\beta}_t \bigg[\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\sigma(u(t,x),h)
\stackrel{\cdot}{\tilde N }(t,x,h)\bigg]$$ and $$\frac{\partial^\beta u}{\partial t^\beta}+\nu(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}
u=I^{1-\beta}_t \bigg[\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\sigma(u(t,x),h) \stackrel{\cdot}{N }(t,x,h)\bigg]$$
in $(d+1)$ dimensions, where $\alpha\in (0,2]$ and $d<\min\{2,\beta^{-1}\}\alpha$, $\nu>0$,
$\partial^\beta_t$ is the Caputo fractional derivative, $-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} $ is the generator
of an isotropic stable process, $I^{1-\beta}_t$ is the fractional integral operator, ${N}(t,x)$
are Poisson random measure with $\tilde{N}(t,x)$ being the compensated Poisson random measure.
$\sigma:{\mathbb{R}}\to{\mathbb{R}}$ is a Lipschitz continuous function. We prove existence
and uniqueness of mild solutions to this equation. Our results extend the results in the case of parabolic
stochastic partial differential equations obtained in "M. Foondun and D. Khoshnevisan. Intermittence
and nonlinear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations. \emph{ Electron. J. Probab.}
{\bf14} (2009), 548--568" and " J. B. Walsh. An Introduction to Stochastic Partial Differential
Equations, \'Ecoled'\'et\'e de Probabilit\'es de Saint-Flour, XIV|1984, Lecture Notes in Math.,
vol. 1180, Springer, Berlin, (1986), 265--439". Under the linear growth of $\sigma$, we show that
the solution of the time fractional stochastic partial differential equation follows an exponential
growth with respect to the time. We also show the nonexistence of the random field solution of both
stochastic partial differential equations when $\sigma$ grows faster than linear.
