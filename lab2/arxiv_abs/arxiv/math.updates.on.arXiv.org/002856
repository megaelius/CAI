Multi-agent systems on nonlinear spaces sometimes fail to synchronize. This is usually attributed
to the initial configuration of the agents being too spread out, the graph topology having certain
undesired symmetries, or both. Besides nonlinearity, the role played by the geometry and topology
of the manifold is often overlooked. We consider intrinsic gradient descent flows of quadratic
disagreement functions on Riemannian manifolds. By requiring that the flow converges to the consensus
manifold $\mathcal{C}$ for almost all initial conditions on any connected graph, we turn manifolds
into the objects of study. We establish necessary conditions for synchronization to occur. If a
Riemannian manifold contains a closed curve of minimum length, then there is a connected graph and
a dense set of initial conditions from which the system fails to reach consensus. In particular,
this holds if the manifold is not simply connected. There is a class of extrinsic consensus protocols
on the special orthogonal group $\mathsf{SO}(n)$ that appears in the Kuramoto model over complex
networks, rigid-body attitude synchronization, and the Lohe model of quantum synchronization.
We show that unlike the corresponding system on the $n$-sphere for $n\in\mathbb{N}\backslash\{1\}$,
the system on $\mathsf{SO}(n)$ fails to converge to $\mathcal{C}$ for a dense subset of initial
values. This is because the $n$-sphere is simply connected for $n\in\mathbb{N}\backslash\{1\}$,
whereas $\mathsf{SO}(n)$ is not. Simulations on the Stiefel manifold suggest that sometimes simple
connectedness is not only necessary but also sufficient. These results show that there is not just
an important difference between synchronization on linear and nonlinear manifolds, but that a
key distinction also lies between simply connected and non-simply connected manifolds.
