This article is devoted to the study of the following semilinear equation with measure data which
originates in the gravitational Maxwell gauged O(3) sigma model, (E) --$\Delta$u + A 0 (k j=1 |x --
p j | 2nj) --a e u (1 + e u) 1+a = 4$\pi$ k j=1 n j $\delta$ pj -- 4$\pi$ l j=1 m j $\delta$ qj in R 2 , where {$\delta$
pj } k j=1 (resp. {$\delta$ qj } l j=1) are Dirac masses concentrated at the points {p j } k j=1 , (resp.
{q j } l j=1), n j and m j are positive integers and a $\ge$ 0. We set N = k j=1 n j and M = l j=1 m j. In previous
works [10, 31], some qualitative properties of solutions of (E) with a = 0 have been established.
Our aim in this article is to study the more general case where a > 0. The additional difficulty of this
case comes from the fact that the nonlinearity is no longer monotone and we cannot construct directly
supersolutions and subsolutions anymore. Instead we develop a new and self-contained approach
which enables us to emphasize the role played by the gravitation in gauged O(3) sigma model. Without
the gravitational term, i.e. a = 0, problem (E) has a layer's structure of solutions {u $\beta$ } $\beta$$\in$(--2(N
--M), --2] , where u $\beta$ is the unique non-topological solution such that u $\beta$ = $\beta$
ln |x| + O(1) for --2(N -- M) < $\beta$ < --2 and u --2 = --2 ln |x| -- 2 ln ln |x| + O(1) at infinity respectively.
On the contrary, when a > 0, the set of solutions to problem (E) has a much richer structure: besides
the topological solutions, there exists a sequence of non-topological solutions in type I, i.e.
such that u tends to --$\infty$ at infinity, of non-topological solutions in type II, which tend
to $\infty$ at infinity. The existence of these types of solutions depends on the values of the parameters
N, M, $\beta$ and on the gravitational interaction associated to a.
