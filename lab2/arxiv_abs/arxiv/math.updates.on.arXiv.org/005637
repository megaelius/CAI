Local asymptotic stabilizability is a topic of great theoretical interest and practical importance.
Broadly, if a system $\dot{x} = f(x,u)$ is locally asymptotically stabilizable, we are guaranteed
a feedback controller $u(x)$ that forces convergence to an equilibrium for trajectories initialized
sufficiently close to it. A necessary condition was given by Brockett: such controllers exist only
when $f$ is open at the equilibrium. Recently, Gupta, Jafari, Kipka and Mordukhovich considered
a modification to this condition, replacing Brockett's topological openness by the linear openness
property of modern variational analysis. In this paper, we show that under the linear openness assumption
there is a local diffeomorphism of neighborhoods of the equilibirum on which the system is exponentially
stabilizable by means of continuous stationary feedback laws. Introducing a transversality property
and relating it to the above diffeomorphism, we prove that linear openness and transversality on
a punctured neighborhood of an equilibrium is sufficient for local exponential stabilizability
of systems with a rank deficient linearization.The main result goes beyond the usual Kalman and
Hautus criteria for the existence of exponential stabilizing feedback laws, since it allows us
to handle systems for which exponential stabilization is achieved through higher-order terms.
However, it is implemented so far under a rather restrictive row-rank conditions. This suggests
a twofold approach to the use of these properties: a point-wise version is enough to ensure stability
via the linearization, while a local version is enough to overcome deficiencies in the linearization.
