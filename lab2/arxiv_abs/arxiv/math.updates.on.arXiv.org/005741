We establish the existence of a broad class of asymptotically Euclidean solutions to Einstein's
constraint equations whose asymptotic behavior at infinity is a priori prescribed. The seed-to-solution
method (as we call it) proposed in this paper encompasses vacuum spaces as well as spaces with (possibly
slowly decaying) matter, and generates a Riemannian manifold from any seed data set consisting
of (1): a Riemannian metric and a symmetric two-tensor prescribed on a manifold with finitely many
asymptotically Euclidean ends, and (2): a (density) field and a (momentum) vector field representing
the matter content. We distinguish between several classes of seed data referred to as tame or strongly
tame, depending whether the prescribed seed data provide a rough or accurate asymptotic Ansatz
at infinity. We encompass classes of metrics with the weakest possible decay (having infinite ADM
mass) or with the strongest possible decay (i.e. having Schwarzschild behavior) at infinity. Our
analysis is based on a linearization of the Einstein operator around a (strongly) tame data and is
motivated by Carlotto and Schoen's pioneering work on the localization problem for Einstein's
vacuum equations. Dealing with Einstein manifolds with low decay and establishing estimates beyond
the critical decay require a significantly different method. We analyze the nonlinear coupling
between the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, and we study terms arising at the critical decay
and uncover the notion of mass-momentum correctors. We estimate the difference between the seed
data and the Einstein solution. We introduce and study the asymptotic localization problem (as
we call it), in which Carlotto-Schoen's localization property is required in an asymptotic sense.
By relying on a parametrized family of seed data, we solve this problem at the critical decay level.
