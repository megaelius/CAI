In this paper we use the fact that every Postnikov planar bicolored (plabic) trivalent graph representing
a given irreducible positroid cell $S$ in the totally non-negative Grassmannian $Gr^{TNN}(k,n)$
is dual to a rationally degenerate $M$-curve $\Gamma$, to provide parametrizations of $S$ in terms
of real regular KP divisors in the ovals of $\Gamma$ in agreement with the characterization of real
regular finite-gap solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) II equation found by Dubrovin
and Natanzon [22]. Our construction is based on the connection established by the authors [3,5]
between real regular finite-gap KP solutions [22] and real regular multi-line KP solitons which
are known to be parametrized by points in $Gr^{TNN}(k,n)$ [16,41]. In [3,5] we studied such connection
for Le-graphs with a fixed orientation and were not able to prove the invariance of the KP divisor
with respect to the many geometric gauge freedoms on the network. Here we both extend the previous
construction to any trivalent plabic graph representing the given positroid cell to which the soliton
data belong to and we prove the invariance of the divisor on the choice of gauges using the space of
totally non-negative relations studied in [7]. Such systems of relations were proposed by Lam [50]
in connection with the computation of scattering amplitudes on on-shell diagrams $N=4$ SYM [10]
and govern the totally non-negative amalgamation of the little positive Grassmannians, $Gr^{TP}(1,3)$
and $Gr^{TP}(2,3)$, into any given positroid cell $S\subset Gr^{TNN}(k,n)$. In our setting they
rule the reality and regularity properties of the KP divisor. Finally, we explain the transformation
of both the curve and the divisor under Postnikov moves and reductions and apply our construction
to some examples.
