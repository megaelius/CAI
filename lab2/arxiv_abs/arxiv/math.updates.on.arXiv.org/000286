The fundamental limits of channels with mismatched decoding are addressed. A general formula is
established for the mismatch capacity of a general channel, defined as a sequence of conditional
distributions with a general decoding metrics sequence. We deduce an identity between the Verd\'{u}-Han
general channel capacity formula, and the mismatch capacity formula applied to Maximum Likelihood
decoding metric. Further, several upper bounds on the capacity are provided, and a simpler expression
for a lower bound is derived for the case of a non-negative decoding metric. The general formula is
specialized to the case of finite input and output alphabet channels with a type-dependent metric.
The closely related problem of threshold mismatched decoding is also studied, and a general expression
for the threshold mismatch capacity is obtained. As an example of threshold mismatch capacity,
we state a general expression for the erasures-only capacity of the finite input and output alphabet
channel. We observe that for every channel there exists a (matched) threshold decoder which is capacity
achieving. Additionally, necessary and sufficient conditions are stated for a channel to have
a strong converse. Csisz\'{a}r and Narayan's conjecture is proved for bounded metrics, providing
a positive answer to the open problem introduced in [1], i.e., that the "product-space" improvement
of the lower random coding bound, $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$, is indeed the mismatch capacity of the discrete
memoryless channel $W$. We conclude by presenting an identity between the threshold capacity and
$C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$ in the DMC case.
