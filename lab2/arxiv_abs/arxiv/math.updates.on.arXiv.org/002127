We prove combinatorially some identities related to Euler's partition identity (the number of
partitions of $n$ into distinct parts equals the number of partitions of $n$ into odd parts). They
were conjectured by Beck and proved by Andrews via generating functions. Let $a(n)$ be the number
of partitions of $n$ such that the set of even parts has exactly one element, $b(n)$ be the difference
between the number of parts in all odd partitions of $n$ and the number of parts in all distinct partitions
of $n$, and $c(n)$ be the number of partitions of $n$ in which exactly one part is repeated. Then, $a(n)=b(n)=c(n)$.
The identity $a(n)=c(n)$ was proved combinatorially (in greater generality) by Fu and Tang. We
prove combinatorially that $a(n)=b(n)$ and $b(n)=c(n)$. Our proof relies on bijections between
a set and a multiset, where the partitions in the multiset are decorated with bit strings. Let $c_1(n)$
be the number of partitions of $n$ such that there is exactly one part occurring three times while
all other parts occur only once and let $b_1(n)$ to be the difference between the total number of parts
in the partitions of $n$ into distinct parts and the total number of different parts in the partitions
of $n$ into odd parts. We prove combinatorially that $c_1(n)=b_1(n)$. In addition to these results
by Andrews, we prove combinatorially that $b_1(n)=a_1(n)$, where $a_1(n)$ counts partitions
of $n$ such that the set of even parts has exactly one element and satisfying some additional conditions.
Moreover, we offer an analog of these results for the number of partitions of $n$ with exactly one
part occurring two times while all other parts occur only once.
