Massive MIMO is a variant of multiuser MIMO in which the number of antennas at the base station (BS)
$M$ is very large and typically much larger than the number of served users (data streams) $K$. Recent
research has illustrated the system-level advantages of such a system and in particular the beneficial
effect of increasing the number of antennas $M$. These benefits, however, come at the cost of dramatic
increase in hardware and computational complexity. This is partly due to the fact that the BS needs
to compute suitable beamforming vectors in order to coherently transmit/receive data to/from
each user, where the resulting complexity grows proportionally to the number of antennas $M$ and
the number of served users $K$. Recently, different algorithms based on tools from random matrix
theory in the asymptotic regime of $M,K \to \infty$ with $\frac{K}{M} \to \rho \in (0,1)$ have been
proposed to reduce the complexity. The underlying assumption in all these techniques, however,
is that the exact statistics (covariance matrix) of the channel vectors of the users is a priori known.
This is far from being realistic, especially that in the high-dim regime of $M\to \infty$, estimation
of the underlying covariance matrices is well known to be a very challenging problem. In this paper,
we propose a novel technique for designing beamforming vectors in a massive MIMO system. Our method
is based on the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm and does not require knowledge of the statistics of
the users' channel vectors. We analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm theoretically
and compare its performance with that of other competitive techniques based on random matrix theory
and approximate message passing via numerical simulations. Our results indicate that our proposed
technique has a comparable performance while being highly robust to variations in the channel statistics.
