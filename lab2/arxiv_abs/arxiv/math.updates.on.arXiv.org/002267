We introduce the problem of hidden Hamiltonian cycle recovery, where there is an unknown Hamiltonian
cycle in an $n$-vertex complete graph that needs to be inferred from noisy edge measurements. The
measurements are independent and distributed according to $\calP_n$ for edges in the cycle and
$\calQ_n$ otherwise. This formulation is motivated by a problem in genome assembly, where the goal
is to order a set of contigs (genome subsequences) according to their positions on the genome using
long-range linking measurements between the contigs. Computing the maximum likelihood estimate
in this model reduces to a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Despite the NP-hardness of TSP, we show
that a simple linear programming (LP) relaxation, namely the fractional $2$-factor (F2F) LP, recovers
the hidden Hamiltonian cycle with high probability as $n \to \infty$ provided that $\alpha_n - \log
n \to \infty$, where $\alpha_n \triangleq -2 \log \int \sqrt{d P_n d Q_n}$ is the R\'enyi divergence
of order $\frac{1}{2}$. This condition is information-theoretically optimal in the sense that,
under mild distributional assumptions, $\alpha_n \geq (1+o(1)) \log n$ is necessary for any algorithm
to succeed regardless of the computational cost. Departing from the usual proof techniques based
on dual witness construction, the analysis relies on the combinatorial characterization (in particular,
the half-integrality) of the extreme points of the F2F polytope. Represented as bicolored multi-graphs,
these extreme points are further decomposed into simpler "blossom-type" structures for the large
deviation analysis and counting arguments. Evaluation of the algorithm on real data shows improvements
over existing approaches.
