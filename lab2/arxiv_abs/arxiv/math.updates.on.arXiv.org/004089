We consider interacting particle systems on a large sparse, possibly random, interaction graph
$G_n$, where each particle evolves infinitesimally like a d-dimensional diffusion whose drift
coefficient depends on the histories of its own state and the states of neighboring particles, and
the diffusion coefficient depends only on the history of its own state. We study limits of such particle
systems in the case when the average degree of $G_n$ remains almost surely bounded. Specifically,
under suitable assumptions on the coefficients and initial conditions, we show that if $G_n$ converges
in distribution in the sense of local convergence to a locally finite graph $G$, then the corresponding
particle dynamics converge weakly locally to a certain limit diffusion on $G$. We also show that
for certain graph sequences, including sparse Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph sequences, the limit
of the empirical measure is deterministic and coincides with the law of a typical particle; but show
that in general, the empirical measure limit may fail to coincide with the law of a typical particle,
and it could even remain stochastic. Furthermore, when $G$ is a unimodular Galton-Watson tree,
under suitable assumptions we characterize the limiting dynamics of the neighborhood of a typical
particle in terms of a certain finite-dimensional non-Markovian stochastic process whose infinitesimal
evolution at any time depends not only on the current state of the neighborhood, but also on the conditional
law of the current state given the past of the neighborhood process until that time. This resolves
the open problem of characterizing the limiting dynamics on sequences of sparse Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
graphs. Important ingredients of the proofs include correlation decay estimates, a second-order
Markov random field property for particle trajectories, and a stochastic analytic result on mimicking
It\^{o} processes.
