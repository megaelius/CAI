It is known since Kellerer (1972) that for any process that is increasing for the convex order, or
"peacock" in the terminology of Hirsch et al. 2011, there exist martingales with the same marginal
laws. Nevertheless, there is no general method for finding such martingales that yields diffusions.
Indeed, Kellerer's proof is not constructive: finding the dynamics of processes associated to
a given peacock is not trivial in general. In this paper we are interested in the uniform peacock that
is, the peacock with uniform law at all times on a generic time-varying support $[a(t),b(t)]$. We
derive explicitly the corresponding Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and prove that,
under certain conditions on the boundaries $a(t)$ and $b(t)$, they admit a unique strong solution
yielding the relevant diffusion process. We discuss the relationship between our result and the
previous derivation of diffusion processes associated to square-root and linear time-boundaries,
emphasizing the cases where our approach adds strong uniqueness, and study the local time and activity
of the solution. We then study the peacock with uniform law at all times on a constant support $[-1,1]$
and derive the SDE of an associated mean-reverting diffusion process with uniform margins that
is not a martingale. For the related SDE we prove existence of a solution and move beyond marginal
distributions, that we have proven to be uniform, in deriving the exact transition densities. We
prove limit-laws and ergodic results showing that the SDE solution transition law tends to a uniform
distribution after a long enough time. Finally, we provide a numerical case study showing that these
processes have the desired uniform behaviour. These results may be used to model random probabilities,
random recovery rates or random correlations.
