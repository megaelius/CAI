Arnold's standard circle maps are widely used to study the quasi-periodic route to chaos and other
phenomena associated with nonlinear dynamics in the presence of two rationally unrelated periodicities.
In particular, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is a crucial component of climate
variability on interannual time scales and it is dominated by the seasonal cycle, on the one hand,
and an intrinsic oscillatory instability with a period of a few years, on the other. The role of meteorological
phenomena on much shorter time scales, such as westerly wind bursts, has also been recognized and
modeled as additive noise. We consider herein Arnold maps with additive, uniformly distributed
noise. When the map's nonlinear term, scaled by the parameter $\epsilon$, is sufficiently small,
i.e. $\epsilon < 1$, the map is known to be a diffeomorphism and the rotation number $\rho_{\omega}$
is a differentiable function of the driving frequency $\omega$. We concentrate on the rotation
number's behavior as the nonlinearity becomes large, and show rigorously that $\rho _{\omega }$
is a differentiable function of $\omega $, even for $\epsilon \geq 1$, at every point at which the
noise-perturbed map is mixing. We also provide a formula for the derivative of the rotation number.
The reasoning relies on linear-response theory and a computer-aided proof. In the diffeomorphism
case of $\epsilon <1$, the rotation number $\rho_{\omega }$ behaves monotonically with respect
to $\omega $. We show, using again a computer-aided proof, that this is not the case when $\epsilon
\geq 1$ and the map is not a diffeomorphism.
