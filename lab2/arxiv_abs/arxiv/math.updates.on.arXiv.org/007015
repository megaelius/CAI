One of the most prevalent causes of bridge failure around the world is scour, the gradual erosion
of soil around a bridge foundation due to fast-flowing water. A reliable technique for monitoring
scour would help bridge engineers take timely countermeasures to safeguard against failure. Although
vibration-based techniques for monitoring structural damage have had limited success, primarily
due to insufficient sensitivity, these have tended to focus on the detection of local damage. High
natural frequency sensitivity has recently been reported for scour damage. Previous experiments
to investigate this have been limited as a result of the cost of full-scale testing and the fact that
scaled-down soil structure models tested outside a centrifuge do not adequately simulate full-scale
behaviour. This paper describes the development of what is believed to be the first-ever centrifuge-testing
programme to establish the sensitivity of bridge natural frequency to scour. For the fundamental
mode of vibration, these tests found up to a 40% variation in natural frequency for 30% loss of embedment.
Models of three other types of foundation, which represent a shallow pad foundation, a deep pile
bent and a deep monopile, were also tested in the centrifuge at different scour levels. The shallow
foundation model showed lower frequency sensitivity to scour than the deep foundation models.
The level of frequency sensitivity (3.1 to 44% per scour depth equivalent to 30% of embedment of scour)
detected in this experiment demonstrates the potential for using natural frequency as an indicator
of both local and global scour of bridges, particularly those with deep foundations.
