We consider a variation of the supermarket model in which the servers can communicate with their
neighbors and where the neighborhood relationships are described in terms of a suitable graph.
Tasks with unit-exponential service time distributions arrive at each vertex as independent Poisson
processes with rate $\lambda$, and each task is irrevocably assigned to the shortest queue among
the one it first appears and its $d-1$ randomly selected neighbors. This model has been extensively
studied when the underlying graph is a clique in which case it reduces to the well known power-of-$d$
scheme. In particular, results of Mitzenmacher (1996) and Vvedenskaya et al. (1996) show that as
the size of the clique gets large, the occupancy process associated with the queue-lengths at the
various servers converges to a deterministic limit described by an infinite system of ordinary
differential equations (ODE). In this work, we consider settings where the underlying graph need
not be a clique and is allowed to be suitably sparse. We show that if the minimum degree approaches
infinity (however slowly) as the number of servers $N$ approaches infinity, and the ratio between
the maximum degree and the minimum degree in each connected component approaches 1 uniformly, the
occupancy process converges to the same system of ODE as the classical supermarket model. In particular,
the asymptotic behavior of the occupancy process is insensitive to the precise network topology.
We also study the case where the graph sequence is random, with the $N$-th graph given as an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graph on $N$ vertices with average degree $c(N)$. Annealed convergence of the occupancy
process to the same deterministic limit is established under the condition $c(N)\to\infty$, and
under a stronger condition $c(N)/\ln N\to\infty$, convergence (in probability) is shown for almost
every realization of the random graph.
