In spite of their outstanding experimental relevance, Gaussian operations in continuous-variable
quantum systems are subjected to fundamental limitations, as it is known that general resources
cannot be distilled within the Gaussian paradigm. We show that these limitations can be overcome
by considering a collaborative setting where one party increases the amount of local resource with
the aid of another party, whose operations are assumed to be Gaussian but are otherwise unrestricted;
the two parties can only communicate classically. We show that in single-shot scenarios, unlike
in the well-known case of entanglement theory, two-way classical communication does not lead to
any improvement over one-way classical communication from the aiding party to the aided party.
We then provide a concise general expression for the Gaussian resource of assistance, i.e., the
maximum amount of resource that can be obtained when the aiding party holds a purification of the
aided party's state, as measured by a general monotone. To demonstrate its usefulness, we apply
our result to two important kinds of resources, squeezing and entanglement, and find some simple
analytic solutions. In the case of entanglement theory, we are able to find general upper bounds
on the regularized Gaussian entanglement of assistance, and to establish additivity for tensor
powers of thermal states. This allows us to draw a quantitative and enlightening comparison with
the performance of assisted entanglement distillation in the non-Gaussian setting. On the technical
side, we develop some variational expressions to handle functions of symplectic eigenvalues that
may be of independent interest. Our results suggest further potential for Gaussian operations
to play a major role in practical quantum information processing protocols.
