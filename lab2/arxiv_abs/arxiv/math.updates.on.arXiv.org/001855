In this two-part study we develop a unified approach to the analysis of the global exactness of various
penalty and augmented Lagrangian functions for finite-dimensional constrained optimization
problems. This approach allows one to verify in a simple and straightforward manner whether a given
penalty/augmented Lagrangian function is exact, i.e. whether the problem of unconstrained minimization
of this function is equivalent (in some sense) to the original constrained problem, provided the
penalty parameter is sufficiently large. Our approach is based on the so-called localization principle
that reduces the study of global exactness to a local analysis of a chosen merit function near globally
optimal solutions. In turn, such local analysis can usually be performed with the use of sufficient
optimality conditions and constraint qualifications. In the first paper we introduce the concept
of global parametric exactness and derive the localization principle in the parametric form. With
the use of this version of the localization principle we recover existing simple necessary and sufficient
conditions for the global exactness of linear penalty functions, and for the existence of augmented
Lagrange multipliers of Rockafellar-Wets' augmented Lagrangian. Also, we obtain completely
new necessary and sufficient conditions for the global exactness of general nonlinear penalty
functions, and for the global exactness of a continuously differentiable penalty function for
nonlinear second-order cone programming problems. We briefly discuss how one can construct a continuously
differentiable exact penalty function for nonlinear semidefinite programming problems, as well.
