We propose a general theory whose main component are functorial assignments $$\mathbf{\Sigma}
\mapsto \Omega_{\mathbf{\Sigma}} \in \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{\Sigma}),$$ for a large class of functors
$\mathbf{E}$ from a certain category of bordered surfaces (${\mathbf \Sigma}$'s) to a suitable
a target category of topological vector spaces. The construction is done by summing appropriate
compositions of the initial data over all homotopy classes of successive excisions of embedded
pair of pants. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee these infinite sums converge and as
a result, we can generate mapping class group invariant vectors $\Omega_{\mathbf \Sigma}$ which
we call amplitudes. The initial data encode the amplitude for pair of pants and tori with one boundary,
as well as the "recursion kernels" used for glueing. We give this construction the name of "geometric
recursion", abbreviated GR. As an illustration, we show how to apply our formalism to various spaces
of continuous functions over Teichm\"uller spaces, as Poisson structures on the moduli space of
flat connections. The theory has a wider scope than that and one expects that many functorial objects
in low-dimensional geometry and topology should have a GR construction. The geometric recursion
has various projections to topological recursion (TR) and we in particular show it retrieves all
previous variants and applications of TR. We also show that, for any initial data for topological
recursion, one can construct initial data for GR with values in Frobenius algebra-valued continuous
functions on Teichm\"uller space, such that the $\omega_{g,n}$ of TR are obtained by integration
of the GR amplitudes over the moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces and Laplace transform with
respect the boundary lengths. In this regard, the structure of the Mirzakhani-McShane identities
served as a prototype of GR.
