Fourier Transform Interferometry (FTI) is an appealing Hyperspectral (HS) imaging modality in
the applications demanding high spectral-resolution, such as fluorescence microscopy. However,
the effective resolution of FTI is indeed limited due to the durability of biological elements when
exposed to illuminating light; since over exposed biological elements lose their ability to fluoresce.
In this context, the acquisition of biological HS volumes based on Nyquist sampling rate of Optical
Path Difference (OPD) axis leads to unpleasant trade-offs between spectral resolution, quality
of HS volume, and light exposure. In this paper we propose two variants of the FTI imager, i.e., Coded
Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI) and Coded Aperture FTI (CA-FTI), based on the theory of compressed sensing,
that efficiently modulate light exposure temporally (in CI-FTI) or spatio-temporally (in CA-FTI).
Leveraging a variable density sampling strategy we provide an optimum illumination and aperture
coding, so that the light exposure imposed on a biological specimen is minimized while the spectral
resolution is preserved. Our theoretical analysis consists in two parts, (i) the trade-off between
exposure intensity and the quality of acquired HS volume for a fixed spectral resolution; (ii) the
best HS volume quality for a fixed spectral resolution and constrained exposure budget. Our contributions
can be adapted to an FTI imager without hardware modification. The reconstruction of HS volumes
from compressive sensing FTI measurements relies on an $\ell_1$-norm minimization problem promoting
3D HS sparsity prior. Numerically, we support the proposed methods on synthetic data and simulated
compressed sensing measurements (from actual FTI measurements) under various scenarios. In particular,
the HS volume of biological samples can be reconstructed with a 3-10 fold reduction of exposure.
