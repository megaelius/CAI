According to harmonic analysis (Fourier analysis), any function $f(x)$, periodic over the interval
$[-L, L]$, which satisfies the Dirichlet conditions, can be developed into an infinite sum (known
in the literature as the trigonometric series, and for which, for reasons which will become evident
in the course of this work, we will use the name of sinusoidal series), consisting of the weighted
components of a complete biortogonal base, formed of the unitary function 1, of the fundamental
harmonics $\sin(\pi x/L)$, even and $\cos(\pi x/L)$, odd ($2L$-periodic functions) and of the
secondary harmonics $\sin(n\pi x/L)$ and $\cos(n\pi x/L)$ (periodic functions, with period $2L/n$,
where $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, positive integers). The coefficients of these expansions (Fourier
coefficients) can be calculated using Euler formulas. We will generalize this statement and show
that the function $f(x)$ can also be developed into non-sinusoidal periodic series, formed from
the sum of the weighted components of a complete, non-orthogonal base: the unit function 1, the fundamental
quasi-harmonics $g(x)$, even and $h(x)$, odd ($2L$-periodic functions, with zero mean value over
the definition interval) and the secondary quasi-harmonics $g_n(x)$ and $h_n(x)$ ($2L/n$-periodic
functions), where $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$. The fundamental quasi-harmonics $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are
any functions which admit expansions in sinusoidal series (satisfy Dirichlet conditions, or belong
to $L^2$ space). The coefficients of these expansions are obtained with the help of certain algebraic
relationships between the Fourier coefficients of the expansions of the functions $f(x)$, $g(x)$
and $h(x)$. In addition to their obvious theoretical importance, these types of expansions can
have practical importance in the approximation of functions and in the numerical and analytical
resolution of certain classes of differential equations.
