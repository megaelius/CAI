As consumers are increasingly engaged in social networking and E-commerce activities, businesses
grow to rely on Big Data analytics for intelligence, and traditional IT infrastructures continue
to migrate to the cloud and edge, these trends cause distributed data storage demand to rise at an
unprecedented speed. Erasure coding has seen itself quickly emerged as a promising technique to
reduce storage cost while providing similar reliability as replicated systems, widely adopted
by companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Google. However, it also brings new challenges in characterizing
and optimizing the access latency when erasure codes are used in distributed storage. The aim of
this monograph is to provide a review of recent progress (both theoretical and practical) on systems
that employ erasure codes for distributed storage. In this monograph, we will first identify the
key challenges and taxonomy of the research problems and then give an overview of different approaches
that have been developed to quantify and model latency of erasure-coded storage. This includes
recent work leveraging MDS-Reservation, Fork-Join, Probabilistic, and Delayed-Relaunch scheduling
policies, as well as their applications to characterize access latency (e.g., mean, tail, asymptotic
latency) of erasure-coded distributed storage systems. We will also extend the problem to the case
when users are streaming videos from erasure-coded distributed storage systems. Next, we bridge
the gap between theory and practice, and discuss lessons learned from prototype implementation.
In particular, we will discuss exemplary implementations of erasure-coded storage, illuminate
key design degrees of freedom and tradeoffs, and summarize remaining challenges in real-world
storage systems such as in content delivery and caching. Open problems for future research are discussed
at the end of each chapter.
