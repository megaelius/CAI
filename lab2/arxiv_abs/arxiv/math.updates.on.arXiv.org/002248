Changes in calcium concentration along the sperm flagellum regulates sperm motility and hyperactivation,
characterized by an increased flagellar bend amplitude and beat asymmetry, enabling the sperm
to reach and penetrate the ovum (egg). The signaling pathways by which calcium increases within
the flagellum are well established. However, the exact mechanisms of how calcium regulates flagellar
bending are still under investigation. We extend our previous model of planar flagellar bending
by developing a fluid-structure interaction model that couples the three-dimensional motion
of the flagellum in a viscous, Newtonian fluid with the evolving calcium concentration. The flagellum
is modeled as a Kirchhoff rod: an elastic rod with preferred curvature and twist. The calcium dynamics
are represented as a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model on a moving domain, the centerline
of the flagellum. The two models are coupled assuming that the preferred curvature and twist of the
sperm flagellum depend on the local calcium concentration. To investigate the effect of calcium
on sperm motility, we compare model results of flagellar bend amplitude and swimming speed for three
cases: planar, helical (spiral with equal amplitude in both directions), and quasi-planar (spiral
with small amplitude in one direction). We observe that for the same parameters, the planar swimmer
is faster and a turning motion is more clearly observed when calcium coupling is accounted for in
the model. In the case of flagellar bending coupled to the calcium concentration, we observe emergent
trajectories that can be characterized as a hypotrochoid for both quasi-planar and helical bending.
