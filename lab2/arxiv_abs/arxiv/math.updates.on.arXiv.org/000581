We use a simple N-player stochastic game with idiosyncratic and common noises to introduce the concept
of Master Equation originally proposed by Lions in his lectures at the Coll\`ege de France. Controlling
the limit N tends to the infinity of the explicit solution of the N-player game, we highlight the stochastic
nature of the limit distributions of the states of the players due to the fact that the random environment
does not average out in the limit, and we recast the Mean Field Game (MFG) paradigm in a set of coupled
Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). The first one is a forward stochastic Kolmogorov
equation giving the evolution of the conditional distributions of the states of the players given
the common noise. The second is a form of stochastic Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation providing
the solution of the optimization problem when the flow of conditional distributions is given. Being
highly coupled, the system reads as an infinite dimensional Forward Backward Stochastic Differential
Equation (FBSDE). Uniqueness of a solution and its Markov property lead to the representation of
the solution of the backward equation (i.e. the value function of the stochastic HJB equation) as
a deterministic function of the solution of the forward Kolmogorov equation, function which is
usually called the decoupling field of the FBSDE. The (infinite dimensional) PDE satisfied by this
decoupling field is identified with the \textit{master equation}. We also show that this equation
can be derived for other large populations equilibriums like those given by the optimal control
of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations. The paper is written more in the style of a
review than a technical paper, and we spend more time and energy motivating and explaining the probabilistic
interpretation of the Master Equation, than identifying the most general set of assumptions under
which our claims are true.
