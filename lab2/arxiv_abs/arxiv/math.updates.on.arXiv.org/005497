In applications of remote sensing, estimation, and control, timely communication is not always
ensured by high-rate communication. This work proposes distributed age-efficient transmission
policies for random access channels with $M$ transmitters. In the first part of this work, we analyze
the age performance of stationary randomized policies by relating the problem of finding age to
the absorption time of a related Markov chain. In the second part of this work, we propose the notion
of \emph{age-gain} of a packet to quantify how much the packet will reduce the instantaneous age
of information at the receiver side upon successful delivery. We then utilize this notion to propose
a transmission policy in which transmitters act in a distributed manner based on the age-gain of
their available packets. In particular, each transmitter sends its latest packet only if its corresponding
age-gain is beyond a certain threshold which could be computed adaptively using the collision feedback
or found as a fixed value analytically in advance. Both methods improve age of information significantly
compared to the state of the art. In the limit of large $M$, we prove that when the arrival rate is small
(below $\frac{1}{eM}$), slotted ALOHA-type algorithms are asymptotically optimal. As the arrival
rate increases beyond $\frac{1}{eM}$, while age increases under slotted ALOHA, it decreases significantly
under the proposed age-based policies. For arrival rates $\theta$, $\theta=\frac{1}{o(M)}$,
the proposed algorithms provide a multiplicative factor of at least two compared to the minimum
age under slotted ALOHA (minimum over all arrival rates). We conclude that, as opposed to the common
practice, it is beneficial to increase the sampling rate (and hence the arrival rate) and transmit
packets selectively based on their age-gain.
