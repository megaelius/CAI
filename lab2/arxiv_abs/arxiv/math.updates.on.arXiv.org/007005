In this paper, we shall study the convergence of Taylor approximations for the backward Loewner
differential equation (driven by Brownian motion) near the origin. More concretely, whenever
the initial condition of the backward Loewner equation (which lies in the upper half plane) is small
and has the form $Z_{0} = \varepsilon i$, we show these approximations exhibit an $O(\varepsilon)$
error provided the time horizon is $\varepsilon^{2+\delta}$ for $\delta > 0$. Statements of this
theorem will be given using both rough path and $L^{2}(\mathbb{P})$ estimates. Furthermore, over
the time horizon of $\varepsilon^{2-\delta}$, we shall see that "higher degree" terms within the
Taylor expansion become larger than "lower degree" terms for small $\varepsilon$. In this sense,
the time horizon on which approximations are accurate scales like $\varepsilon^{2}$. This scaling
comes naturally from the Loewner equation when growing vector field derivatives are balanced against
decaying iterated integrals of the Brownian motion. As well as being of theoretical interest, this
scaling may be used as a guiding principle for developing adaptive step size strategies which perform
efficiently near the origin. In addition, this result highlights the limitations of using stochastic
Taylor methods (such as the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein methods) for approximating $SLE_{\kappa}$
traces. Due to the analytically tractable vector fields of the Loewner equation, we will show Ninomiya-Victoir
(or Strang) splitting is particularly well suited for SLE simulation. As the singularity at the
origin can lead to large numerical errors, we shall employ the adaptive step size proposed by Tom
Kennedy to discretize $SLE_{\kappa}$ traces using this splitting. We believe that the Ninomiya-Victoir
scheme is the first high order numerical method that has been successfully applied to $SLE_{\kappa}$
traces.
