We prove a series of Approximation Theorems in the setting of Waldhausen quasicategories. These
theorems, inspired by Waldhausen's 1985 Approximation Theorem, give sufficient conditions for
an exact functor of Waldhausen quasicategories to induce a level-wise weak homotopy equivalence
of K-theory spectra. The Pre-Approximation Theorem, which holds in the general setting of quasicategories
without Waldhausen structures, provides sufficient conditions for a functor F:A->B to restrict
to an equivalence of the maximal infinity-groupoids in A and B. Our Approximation Theorems follow
from the Pre-Approximation Theorem. The Approximation Theorem in the quasicategorical setting
most analogous to Waldhausen's is: if an exact functor F:A -> B satisfies Waldhausen's App 1 and App
2, and the domain A admits colimits of the aforementioned type and F preserves them, then K(F) is a
level-wise equivalence. As a corollary, if F is an exact functor with ho(F) an equivalence of ordinary
categories, and every morphism in the domain A is a cofibration, then K(F) is a level-wise equivalence.
We then introduce a version of App 2 called Cofibration App 2 that only requires factorization of
cofibrations Fa >-> b as (equiv) o F(cofibration) and prove an analogous Cofibration Approximation
Theorem, and a corollary for certain functors that induce an equivalence of cofibration homotopy
categories. We also prove that S_n^infinity is Waldhausen equivalent to \overline{\mathcal{F}_{n-1}^infinity}
using the mid anodyne maps known as spine inclusions, and clarify how hypotheses and notions in Waldhausen
structures are related in new ways in the context of quasicategories.
