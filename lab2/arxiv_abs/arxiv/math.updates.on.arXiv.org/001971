We introduce and begin to explore the mean and median of finite sets of shapes represented as integral
currents. The median can be computed efficiently in practice, and we focus most of our theoretical
and computational attention on medians. We consider questions on the existence and regularity
of medians. While the median might not exist in all cases, we show that a mass-regularized median
is guaranteed to exist. When the input shapes are modeled by integral currents with shared boundaries
in codimension $1$, we show that the median is guaranteed to exist, and is contained in the \emph{envelope}
of the input currents. On the other hand, we show that medians can be \emph{wild} in this setting,
and smooth inputs can generate non-smooth medians. For higher codimensions, we show that \emph{books}
are minimizing for a finite set of $1$-currents in $\Bbb{R}^3$ with shared boundaries. As part of
this proof, we present a new result in graph theory---that \emph{cozy} graphs are \emph{comfortable}---which
should be of independent interest. Further, we show that regular points on the median have book-like
tangent cones in this case. From the point of view of computation, we study the median shape in the
settings of a finite simplicial complex. When the input shapes are represented by chains of the simplicial
complex, we show that the problem of finding the median shape can be formulated as an integer linear
program. This optimization problem can be solved as a linear program in practice, thus allowing
one to compute median shapes efficiently. We provide open source code implementing our methods,
which could also be used by anyone to experiment with ideas of their own. The software could be accessed
