Predicting the response of a system to perturbations is a key challenge in mathematical and natural
sciences. Under suitable conditions on the nature of the system, of the perturbation, and of the
observables of interest, response theories allow to construct operators describing the smooth
change of the invariant measure of the system of interest as a function of the small parameter controlling
the intensity of the perturbation. In particular, response theories can be developed both for stochastic
and chaotic deterministic dynamical systems, where in the latter case stricter conditions imposing
some degree of structural stability are required. In this paper we extend previous findings and
derive general response formulae describing how n-point correlations are affected by perturbations
to the vector flow. We also show how to compute the response of the spectral properties of the system
to perturbations. We then apply our results to the seemingly unrelated problem of coarse graining
in multiscale systems: we find explicit formulae describing the change in the terms describing
parameterisation of the neglected degrees of freedom resulting from applying perturbations to
the full system. All the terms envisioned by the Mori-Zwanzig theory - the deterministic, stochastic,
and non-Markovian terms - are affected at 1st order in the perturbation. The obtained results provide
a more comprehesive understanding of the response of statistical mechanical systems to perturbations
and contribute to the goal of constructing accurate and robust parameterisations and are of potential
relevance for fields like molecular dynamics, condensed matter, and geophysical fluid dynamics.
We envision possible applications of our general results to the study of the response of climate
variability to anthropogenic and natural forcing and to the study of the equivalence of thermostatted
statistical mechanical systems.
