Predictions of physical phenomena in buildings are carried out by using physical models formulated
as a mathematical problem and solved by means of numerical methods, aiming at evaluating, for instance,
the building thermal or hygrothermal performance by calculating distributions and fluxes of heat
and moisture transfer. Therefore, the choice of the numerical method is crucial since it is a compromise
among (i) the solution accuracy, (ii) the computational cost to obtain the solution and (iii) the
complexity of the method implementation. An efficient numerical method enables to compute an accurate
solution with a minimum computational run time (CPU). On that account, this article brings an investigation
on the performance of three numerical methods. The first one is the standard and widely used finite-difference
approach, while the second one is the so-called RC approach, which is a particular method brought
to the building physics area by means of an analogy of electric circuits. The third numerical method
is the spectral one, which has been recently proposed to solve nonlinear diffusive problems in building
physics. The three methods are evaluated in terms of accuracy on the assessment of the dependent
variable (temperature or vapor pressure) or of density of fluxes for three different cases: i) heat
diffusion through a concrete slab, ii) moisture diffusion through an aerated concrete slab and
iii) heat diffusion using measured temperatures as boundary conditions. Results highlight the
spectral approach as the most accurate method. The RC based model with a few number of resistances
does not provide accurate results for temperature and vapor pressure distributions neither to
flux densities nor conduction loads.
