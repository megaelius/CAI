The paper is another step towards a realisation of the goal, advanced in articles 1706.05682 [hep-th]
and 1808.04470 [hep-th], of a systematic supersymmetry-equivariant geometrisation of physically
distinguished Green-Schwarz super-(p+2)-cocycles defining classes in the supersymmetry-invariant
refinement of the de Rham cohomology of homogeneous spaces of (supersymmetry) Lie supergroups,
associated with reductive decompositions of their Lie superalgebras. It deals with a correlated
geometrisation of a pair of such super-(p+2)-cocycles on spaces in correspondence under a blow-up
transformation dual to the \.In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction that relates the respective (supersymmetry)
Lie superalgebras, the latter correspondence being taken as the organising principle of the geometrisation
procedure that exploits the link between the Cartan-Eilenberg cohomology of the supersymmetry
group and the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of its Lie superalgebra, alongside a cohomological
classification of central extensions thereof. A general scheme of a correlated geometrisation
compatible with the contraction is laid out and illustrated on the nontrivial example of a pair of
consistent super-0-brane backgrounds: the super-Minkowski space $sMink^{3,1|8}$ with the standard
N=2 Green-Schwarz super-2-cocycle on it and the super-$AdS_2 \times S^2$ space with Zhou's super-2-cocycle
on it, asymptoting to the former in the limit of an infinite common radius of the $AdS_2$ and the $S^2$
in the body $AdS_2\times S^2$ of the supertarget. The geometrisation yields the respective supersymmetry-equivariant
super-0-gerbes, i.e., the prequantum bundles of the associated Green-Schwarz super-$\sigma$-models
in the Nambu-Goto formulation. Upon passing to the equivalent Hughes-Polchinski formulation
of the models, the relevant extended super-0-gerbes are verified to possess a weak $\kappa$-equivariant
structure.
