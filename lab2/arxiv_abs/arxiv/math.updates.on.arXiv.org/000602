Given a $2^N$-dimensional Cayley-Dickson algebra, where $3 \leq N \leq 6$, we first observe that
the multiplication table of its imaginary units $e_a$, $1 \leq a \leq 2^N -1$, is encoded in the properties
of the projective space PG$(N-1,2)$ if one regards these imaginary units as points and distinguished
triads of them $\{e_a, e_b, e_c\}$, $1 \leq a < b <c \leq 2^N -1$ and $e_ae_b = \pm e_c$, as lines.
This projective space is seen to feature two distinct kinds of lines according as $a+b = c$ or $a+b
\neq c$. Consequently, it also exhibits (at least two) different types of points in dependence on
how many lines of either kind pass through each of them. In order to account for such partition of the
PG$(N-1,2)$, the concept of Veldkamp space of a finite point-line incidence structure is employed.
The corresponding point-line incidence structure is found to be a binomial $\left({N+1 \choose
2}_{N-1}, {N+1 \choose 3}_{3}\right)$-configuration ${\cal C}_N$; in particular, ${\cal C}_3$
(octonions) is isomorphic to the Pasch $(6_2,4_3)$-configuration, ${\cal C}_4$ (sedenions)
is the famous Desargues $(10_3)$-configuration, ${\cal C}_5$ (32-nions) coincides with the Cayley-Salmon
$(15_4,20_3)$-configuration found in the well-known Pascal mystic hexagram and ${\cal C}_6$
(64-nions) is identical with a particular $(21_5,35_3)$-configuration that can be viewed as four
triangles in perspective from a line where the points of perspectivity of six pairs of them form a
Pasch configuration. We also draw attention to a remarkable nesting pattern formed by these configurations,
where ${\cal C}_{N-1}$ occurs as a geometric hyperplane of ${\cal C}_N$. Finally, a brief examination
of the structure of generic ${\cal C}_N$ leads to a conjecture that ${\cal C}_N$ is isomorphic to
a combinatorial Grassmannian of type $G_2(N+1)$.
