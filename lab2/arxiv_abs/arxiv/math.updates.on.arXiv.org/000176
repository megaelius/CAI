This paper aims at shedding a new light on the novelty of Poincar\'e's M\'ethodes nouvelles de la
m\'ecanique c\'eleste. The latter's approach to the three-body-problem has often been celebrated
as a starting point of chaos theory in relation to the investigation of dynamical systems. Yet, the
novelty of Poincar\'e's strategy can also be analyzed as having been cast out some specific algebraic
practices for manipulating systems of linear equations. As the structure of a cast-iron building
may be less noticeable than its creative fa\c{c}ade, the algebraic cast of Poincar\'e's strategy
was broken out of the mold in generating the new methods of celestial mechanics. But as the various
components that are mixed in some casting process can still be detected in the resulting alloy, this
algebraic cast points to some collective dimensions of the M\'ethodes nouvelles. It thus allow
to analyze Poincar\'e's individual creativity in regard with the collective dimensions of some
algebraic cultures. At a global scale, Poincar\'e's strategy is a testimony of the pervading influence
of what used to play the role of a shared algebraic culture in the 19th century, i.e., much before the
development of linear algebra as a specific discipline. This shared culture was usually identified
by references to the ''equation to the secular inequalities in planetary theory.'' This form of
identification highlights the long shadow of the great treatises of mechanics published at the
end of the 18th century. At a more local scale, Poincar\'e's approach can be analyzed in regard with
the specific evolution that Hermite's algebraic theory of forms impulsed to the culture of the secular
equation. Moreover, this papers shows that some specific aspects of Poincar\'e's own creativity
result from a process of acculturation of the latter to Jordan's practices of reductions of linear
substitutions within the local algebraic culture anchored in Hermite's legacy .
