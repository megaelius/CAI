In this paper, we introduce ordered blueprints and ordered blue schemes, which serve as a common
language for the different approaches to tropicalizations and which enhances tropical varieties
with a schematic structure. As an abstract concept, we consider a tropicalization as a moduli problem
about extensions of a given valuation $v:k\to T$ between ordered blueprints $k$ and $T$. If $T$ is
idempotent, then we show that a generalization of the Giansiracusa bend relation leads to a representing
object for the tropicalization, and that it has yet another interpretation in terms of a base change
along $v$. We call such a representing object a scheme theoretic tropicalization. This theory recovers
and improves other approaches to tropicalizations as we explain with care in the second part of this
text. The Berkovich analytification and the Kajiwara-Payne tropicalization appear as rational
point sets of a scheme theoretic tropicalization. The same holds true for its generalization by
Foster and Ranganathan to higher rank valuations. The scheme theoretic Giansiracusa tropicalization
can be recovered from the scheme theoretic tropicalizations in our sense. We obtain an improvement
due to the resulting blueprint structure, which is sufficient to remember the Maclagan-Rinc\'on
weights. The Macpherson analytification has an interpretation in terms of a scheme theoretic tropicalization,
and we give an alternative approach to Macpherson's construction of tropicalizations. The Thuillier
analytification and the Ulirsch tropicalization are rational point sets of a scheme theoretic
tropicalization. Our approach yields a generalization to any, possibly nontrivial, valuation
$v:k\to T$ with idempotent $T$ and enhances the tropicalization with a schematic structure.
