We study energy propagation along line-defects (edges) in 2D continuous, energy preserving periodic
media. The unperturbed medium (bulk) is modeled by a honeycomb Schroedinger operator, which is
periodic with respect to the triangular lattice, invariant under parity, P, and complex-conjugation,
C. A honeycomb operator has Dirac points: two dispersion surfaces touch conically at an energy level,
$E_D$ [25,27]. Periodic perturbations which break P or C open a gap in the essential spectrum about
energy $E_D$. Such operators model an insulator near energy $E_D$. Our edge operator is a small perturbation
of the bulk and models a transition (via a domain wall) between distinct periodic, P or C breaking
perturbations. The edge operator permits energy transport along the line-defect. The associated
energy channels are called edge states. They are time-harmonic solutions which are localized near
and propagating along the line-defect. We completely characterize the edge state spectrum within
the bulk spectral gap about $E_D$. At the center of our analysis is an expansion of the edge operator
resolvent for energies near $E_D$. The leading term features the resolvent of an effective Dirac
operator. Edge state eigenvalues are poles of the resolvent, which bifurcate from the Dirac point.
The corresponding eigenstates have the multiscale structure identified in [23]. We extend earlier
work on zigzag-type edges [14] to all rational edges. We elucidate the role in edge state formation
played by the type of symmetry-breaking and the orientation of the edge. We prove the resolvent expansion
by a new direct and transparent strategy. Our results provide a rigorous explanation of the numerical
observations [22,38}; see also the photonic experimental study in [42]. Finally, we discuss implications
for the Valley Hall Effect, which concerns quantum Hall-like energy transport in honeycomb structures.
