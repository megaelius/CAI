Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) are well-suited to quantifying uncertainty in models parameterized
by independent random variables. The assumption of independence leads to simple strategies for
evaluating PCE coefficients. In contrast, the application of PCE to models of dependent variables
is much more challenging. Three approaches can be used. The first approach uses mapping methods
where measure transformations, such as the Nataf and Rosenblatt transformation, can be used to
map dependent random variables to independent ones; however we show that this can significantly
degrade performance since the Jacobian of the map must be approximated. A second strategy is the
class of dominating support methods which build PCE using independent random variables whose distributional
support dominates the support of the true dependent joint density; we provide evidence that this
approach appears to produce approximations with suboptimal accuracy. A third approach, the novel
method proposed here, uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) to numerically compute orthonormal
polynomials for the dependent random variables. This approach has been used successfully when
solving differential equations using the intrusive stochastic Galerkin method, and in this paper
we use GSO to build PCE using a non-intrusive stochastic collocation method. The stochastic collocation
method treats the model as a black box and builds approximations of model output from a set of samples.
Building PCE from samples can introduce ill-conditioning which does not plague stochastic Galerkin
methods. To mitigate this ill-conditioning we generate weighted Leja sequences, which are nested
sample sets, to build accurate polynomial interpolants. We show that our proposed approach produces
PCE which are orders of magnitude more accurate than PCE constructed using mapping or dominating
support methods.
