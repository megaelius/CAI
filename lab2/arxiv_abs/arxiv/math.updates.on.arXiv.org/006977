This paper considers a wireless network with a base station (BS) conducting timely status updates
to multiple clients via adaptive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)/orthogonal multiple
access (OMA). Specifically, the BS is able to adaptively switch between NOMA and OMA for the downlink
transmission to optimize the information freshness of the network, characterized by the Age of
Information (AoI) metric. If the BS chooses OMA, it can only serve one client within each time slot
and should decide which client to serve; if the BS chooses NOMA, it can serve more than one client at
the same time and needs to decide the power allocated to the served clients. For the simple two-client
case, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and develop the optimal policy for the
BS to decide whether to use NOMA or OMA for each downlink transmission based on the instantaneous
AoI of both clients. The optimal policy is shown to have a switching-type property with obvious decision
switching boundaries. A near-optimal policy with lower computation complexity is also devised.
For the more general multi-client scenario, inspired by the proposed near-optimal policy, we formulate
a nonlinear optimization problem to determine the optimal power allocated to each client by maximizing
the expected AoI drop of the network in each time slot. We resolve the formulated problem by approximating
it as a convex optimization problem. We also derive the upper bound of the gap between the approximate
convex problem and the original nonlinear, nonconvex problem. Simulation results validate the
effectiveness of the adopted approximation. The performance of the adaptive NOMA/OMA scheme by
solving the convex optimization is shown to be close to that of max-weight policy solved by exhaustive
search...
