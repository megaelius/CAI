Traditionally, research focusing on the design of routing and staffing policies for service systems
has modeled servers as having fixed (possibly heterogeneous) service rates. However, service
systems are generally staffed by people. Furthermore, people respond to workload incentives;
that is, how hard a person works can depend both on how much work there is, and how the work is divided
between the people responsible for it. In a service system, the routing and staffing policies control
such workload incentives; and so the rate servers work will be impacted by the system's routing and
staffing policies. This observation has consequences when modeling service system performance,
and our objective in this paper is to investigate those consequences. We do this in the context of
the M/M/N queue, which is the canonical model for large service systems. First, we present a model
for "strategic" servers that choose their service rate in order to maximize a trade-off between
an "effort cost", which captures the idea that servers exert more effort when working at a faster
rate, and a "value of idleness", which assumes that servers value having idle time. Next, we characterize
the symmetric Nash equilibrium service rate under any routing policy that routes based on the server
idle time (such as the longest idle server first policy). This allows us to (asymptotically) solve
the problem of minimizing the total cost, when there are linear staffing costs and linear waiting
costs. We find that an asymptotically optimal staffing policy staffs strictly more than the common
square-root staffing policy. Finally, we end by exploring the question of whether routing policies
that are based on the service rate, instead of the server idle time, can improve system performance.
