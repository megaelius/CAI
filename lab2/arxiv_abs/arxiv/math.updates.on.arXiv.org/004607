In the past years, many computational methods have been developed to infer the structure of gene
regulatory networks from time-series data. However, the applicability and accuracy presumptions
of such algorithms remain unclear due to experimental heterogeneity. This paper assesses the performance
of recent and successful network inference strategies under a novel, multifactorial evaluation
framework in order to highlight pragmatic tradeoffs in experimental design. The effects of data
quantity and systems perturbations are addressed, thereby formulating guidelines for efficient
resource management. Realistic data were generated from six widely used benchmark models of rhythmic
and non-rhythmic gene regulatory systems with random perturbations mimicking the effect of gene
knock-out or chemical treatments. Then, time-series data of increasing lengths were provided
to five state-of-the-art network inference algorithms representing distinctive mathematical
paradigms. The performances of such network reconstruction methodologies are uncovered under
various experimental conditions. We report that the algorithms do not benefit equally from data
increments. Furthermore, for rhythmic systems, it is more profitable for network inference strategies
to be run on long time-series rather than short time-series with multiple perturbations. By contrast,
for the non-rhythmic systems, increasing the number of perturbation experiments yielded better
results than increasing the sampling frequency. We expect that future benchmark and algorithm
design would integrate such multifactorial considerations to promote their widespread and conscientious
usage.
