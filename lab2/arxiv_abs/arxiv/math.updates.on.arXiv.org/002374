We show how topological methods developed in a previous article can be applied to prove new results
about topological and homological finiteness properties of monoids. A monoid presentation is
called special if the right-hand side of each relation is equal to $1$. We prove results which relate
the finiteness properties of a monoid defined by a special presentation with those of its group of
units. Specifically we show that the monoid inherits the properties $F_n$ and $FP_n$ from its group
of units. We also obtain results which relate the geometric and cohomological dimensions of the
monoid to those of its group of units. As an application of these results we show that all monoids defined
by one-relator presentations of the form $\langle A \mid r=1 \rangle$ are of type left- and right-$F_{\infty}$
(and $FP_{\infty}$), resolving an important case of a question of Kobayashi from 2000 on homological
finiteness properties of one-relator monoids. Moreover, in the case that the relator $r$ is not
a proper power, we prove that the right and left geometric and cohomological dimensions of the monoid
are bounded above by $2$. We also show how our topological approach can be used to prove results about
the closure properties of right and left-$F_n$, bi-$F_n$, right and left geometric and cohomological
dimension, and geometric and Hochschild cohomological dimension of monoids, for amalgamated
free products of monoids and HNN extension constructions for monoids. To prove these results we
introduce new methods for constructing equivariant, and bi-equivariant, classifying spaces
for monoids, as well as developing a Bass-Serre theory for free constructions of monoids. Additionally,
we give a topological proof that a free inverse monoid on one or more generators is neither of type
left-$FP_2$ nor right-$FP_2$. This generalises a classical result of Schein that such monoids
are not finitely presented.
