We consider a scenario of broadcasting information over a network of nodes connected by noiseless
communication links. A source node in the network has some data packets to broadcast. It encodes
these data packets into $n$ coded packets in such a way that any node in the network that receives any
$k$ out of the $n$ coded packets will be able to retrieve all the original data packets. The source
transmits the $n$ coded packets to its one-hop neighbours. Every other node in the network follows
a probabilistic forwarding protocol, in which it forwards a previously unreceived packet to all
its neighbours with a certain probability $p$. We say that the information from the source undergoes
a ``near-broadcast'' if the expected fraction of nodes that receive at least $k$ of the $n$ coded
packets is close to $1$. The forwarding probability $p$ is chosen so as to minimize the expected total
number of transmissions needed for a near-broadcast. We study how, for a given $k$, this minimum
forwarding probability and the associated expected total number of packet transmissions varies
with $n$. We specifically analyze the probabilistic forwarding of coded packets on two network
topologies: binary trees and square grids. For trees, our analysis shows that for fixed $k$, the
expected total number of transmissions increases with $n$. On the other hand, on grids, a judicious
choice of $n$ significantly reduces the expected total number of transmissions needed for a near-broadcast.
Behaviour similar to that of the grid is also observed in other well-connected network topologies
such as random geometric graphs and random regular graphs
