We present some exact integrability cases of the extended Li\'{e}nard equation $y^{\prime \prime
}+f\left( y\right) \left(y^{\prime }\right)^{n}+k\left( y\right) \left(y^{\prime }\right)^{m}+g\left(y\right)
y^{\prime }+h\left( y\right) =0$, with $n>0$ and $m>0$ arbitrary constants, while $f(y)$, $k(y)$,
$g(y)$, and $h(y)$ are arbitrary functions. The solutions are obtained by transforming the equation
Li\'{e}nard equation to an equivalent first kind first order Abel type equation given by $\frac{dv}{dy}
=f\left( y\right) v^{3-n}+k\left( y\right) v^{3-m}+g\left( y\right) v^{2}+h\left( y\right)
v^{3}$, with $v=1/y^{\prime }$. As a first step in our study we obtain three integrability cases
of the extended quadratic-cubic Li\'{e}nard equation, corresponding to $n=2$ and $m=3$, by assuming
that particular solutions of the associated Abel equation are known. Under this assumption the
general solutions of the Abel and Li\'{e}nard equations with coefficients satisfying some differential
conditions can be obtained in an exact closed form. With the use of the Chiellini integrability condition,
we show that if a particular solution of the Abel equation is known, the general solution of the extended
quadratic cubic Li\'{e}nard equation can be obtained by quadratures. The Chiellini integrability
condition is extended to generalized Abel equations with $g(y)\equiv 0$ and $h(y)\equiv 0$, and
arbitrary $n$ and $m$, thus allowing to obtain the general solution of the corresponding Li\'{e}nard
equation. The application of the generalized Chiellini condition to the case of the reduced Riccati
equation is also considered.
