There is a rich history of models for the interaction of a biological contagion like influenza with
the spread of related information such as an influenza vaccination campaign. Recent work on the
spread of interacting contagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions
can have counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one of these frameworks
to tackle three important features of the spread of awareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics
on highly clustered, cliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the
awareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing its transmission
rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to be infected; and three, the biological
contagion also affects the spread of the awareness contagion but by increasing its transmission
rate where an infected individual is more receptive and more likely to share information related
to the disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network clustering, which is known
to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to sustain larger epidemics of the disease in models
with awareness. This counter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting
that random networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts. To further
investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on a two-step branching process
(i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary infections) to identify different regions in parameter
space where the net effect of clustering and co-infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight
once again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and illustrate the type of analysis
that is possible even in complex models of interacting contagions.
