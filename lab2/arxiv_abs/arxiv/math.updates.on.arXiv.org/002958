New results on conditional joint probability distributions of first exit times are presented for
a continuous-time stochastic process defined as the mixture of Markov jump processes moving at
different speeds on the same finite state space, while the mixture occurs at a random time. Such mixture
was first proposed by Frydman \cite{Frydman2005} and Frydman and Schuermann \cite{Frydman2008}
as a generalization of the mover-stayer model of Blumen et at. \cite{Blumen}, and was recently extended
by Surya \cite{Surya2018}, in which explicit distributional identities of the process are given,
in particular in the presence of an absorbing state. We revisit \cite{Surya2018} for a finite mixture
with overlapping absorbing sets. The contribution of this paper is two fold. First, we generalize
distributional properties of the mixture discussed in \cite{Frydman2008} and \cite{Surya2018}.
Secondly, we give distributional identities of the first exit times explicitly in terms of intensity
matrices of the underlying Markov processes and the Bayesian updates of switching probability
and of the probability distribution of states, despite the fact that the mixture itself is non-Markov.
They form non-stationary functions of time and have the ability to capture heterogeneity and path
dependence when conditioning on the available information (either full or partial) of the process.
In particular, initial profile of the distributions forms of a generalized mixture of multivariate
phase-type distributions of Assaf et al. \cite{Assaf1984}. When the underlying processes move
at the same speed, in which case the mixture becomes a simple Markov process, these features are removed,
and the initial distributions reduce to \cite{Assaf1984}. Some explicit and numerical examples
are discussed to illustrate the main results.
