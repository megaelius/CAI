Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra. Drinfeld proved that the universal R-matrix of a Yangian
Yg gives rise to solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equations on irreducible, finite-dimensional
representations of Yg, which are rational in the spectral parameter. This result was recently extended
by Maulik-Okounkov to symmetric Kac-Moody algebras, and representations arising from geometry.
We show that this rationality ceases to hold if one considers arbitrary finite-dimensional representations,
at least if one requires such solutions to be natural with respect to the representation and compatible
with tensor products. Equivalently, the tensor category of finite-dimensional representations
of Yg does not admit rational commutativity constraints. We construct instead two meromorphic
commutativity constraints, which are related by a unitarity condition. We show that each possesses
an asymptotic expansion as s tends to infinity, which has the same formal properties as Drinfeld's
R(s), and therefore coincides with the latter by uniqueness. In particular, we give an alternative,
constructive proof of the existence of the universal R-matrix of Yg. Our construction relies on
the Gauss decomposition R^+(s)R^0(s)R^-(s) of R(s). The divergent abelian term R^0 was resummed
on finite-dimensional representations by the first two authors in arXiv:1403.5251. The main ingredient
of the present paper is the construction of R^+(s) and R^-(s). We prove that they are rational functions
on finite-dimensional representations, and that they intertwine the standard coproduct of Yg
and the deformed Drinfeld coproduct introduced in arXiv:1403.5251.
