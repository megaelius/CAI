Given a large social or information network, how can we partition the vertices into sets (i.e., colors)
such that no two vertices linked by an edge are in the same set while minimizing the number of sets used.
Despite the obvious practical importance of graph coloring, existing work has not systematically
investigated or designed methods for large complex networks. In this work, we develop a unified
framework for coloring large complex networks that consists of two main coloring variants that
effectively balances the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using this framework as a fundamental
basis, we propose coloring methods designed for the scale and structure of complex networks. In
particular, the methods leverage triangles, triangle-cores, and other egonet properties and
their combinations. We systematically compare the proposed methods across a wide range of networks
(e.g., social, web, biological networks) and find a significant improvement over previous approaches
in nearly all cases. Additionally, the solutions obtained are nearly optimal and sometimes provably
optimal for certain classes of graphs (e.g., collaboration networks). The coloring is also shown
to be extremely effective for detecting graph outliers as well as graph classification (i.e., predicting
the type of a graph). We also propose a parallel algorithm for the problem of coloring neighborhood
subgraphs and make several key observations. Overall, the coloring methods are shown to be (i) accurate
with solutions close to optimal, (ii) fast and scalable for large networks, and (iii) flexible for
use in a variety of applications.
