In (Jin, 2018), a new day-to-day dynamical system was proposed for drivers' departure time choice
at a single bottleneck. Based on three behavioral principles, the nonlocal departure and arrival
times choice problems were converted to the local scheduling payoff choice problem, whose day-to-day
dynamics are described by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model on an imaginary road of increasing
scheduling payoff. Thus the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE), the arrival time user equilibrium
(ATUE), and the scheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) are uniquely determined by the stationary
state of the LWR model, which was shown to be locally, asymptotically stable with analysis of the
discrete approximation of the LWR model and through a numerical example. In this study attempt to
analytically prove the global stability of the SPUE, ATUE, and DTUE. We first generalize the conceptual
models for arrival time and scheduling payoff choices developed in (Jin, 2018) for a single bottleneck
with a generalized scheduling cost function, which includes the cost of the free-flow travel time.
Then we present the LWR model for the day-to-day dynamics for the scheduling payoff choice as well
as the SPUE. We further formulate a new optimization problem for the SPUE and demonstrate its equivalent
to the optimization problem for the ATUE in (Iryo and Yoshii, 2007). Finally we show that the objective
functions in the two optimization formulations are equal and can be used as the potential function
for the LWR model and prove that the stationary state of the LWR model, and therefore, the SPUE, DTUE,
and ATUE, are globally, asymptotically stable, by using Lyapunov's second method. Such a globally
stable behavioral model can provide more efficient departure time and route choice guidance for
human drivers and connected and autonomous vehicles in more complicated networks.
