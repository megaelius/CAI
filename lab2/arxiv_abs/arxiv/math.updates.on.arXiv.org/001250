The design of Wireless Information and Power Transfer (WIPT) has so far relied on an oversimplified
and inaccurate linear model of the energy harvester. In this paper, we depart from this linear model
and design WIPT considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the rectifier
nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general multicarrier modulated input waveforms.
Leveraging that model, we motivate and introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition
of multi-carrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The superposed WIPT
waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state information so as to characterize the
rate-energy region of the whole system. Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance
of the derived waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically changes
the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First, analysis (confirmed by circuit
simulations) shows that modulated and unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless
power delivery, namely modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but detrimental
in multi-carrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated waveform (superposed to
a multi-carrier modulated waveform) is useful to enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third,
a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a non-zero
mean Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-achieving zero-mean
Gaussian input distribution in multi-carrier transmissions. Fifth, the rectifier nonlinearity
is beneficial to system performance and is essential to efficient WIPT design.
