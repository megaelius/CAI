Electrical circuits made only of perfectly conductive wires can be seen as partitions between finite
sets. These are also known as "corelations" and are the morphisms in the category $\mathrm{FinCorel}$.
The two-element set has two different Frobenius monoid structures in $\mathrm{FinCorel}$. These
two Frobenius monoids are related to "series" and "parallel" junctions, which are used to connect
pairs of wires. We show that these Frobenius monoids interact to form a "weak bimonoid" as defined
by Pastro and Street. We conjecture a presentation for the subcategory of $\mathrm{FinCorel}$
generated by the morphisms associated to these two Frobenius monoids, which we call $\mathrm{FinCorel}^{\circ}$.
We are interested in "bond graphs," which are built from series and parallel junctions. Although
the morphisms of $\mathrm{FinCorel}^{\circ}$ resemble bond graphs, there is not a perfect correspondence.
Since bond graphs and circuits determine Lagrangian relations between symplectic vector spaces,
we then consider the category of Lagrangian relations, $\mathrm{LagRel}_k$. Bond graphs pick
out a subcategory $\mathrm{LagRel}_k^{\circ}$ with generating morphisms corresponding to those
of $\mathrm{FinCorel}^{\circ}$. Thus we define a category $\mathrm{BondGraph}$ with generators
and equations that are found in both $\mathrm{FinCorel}^{\circ}$ and $\mathrm{LagRel}_k^{\circ}$.
We study the functorial semantics of $\mathrm{BondGraph}$ by giving two different functors from
it to the category $\mathrm{LagRel}_k$ and a natural transformation between them. Given a bond
graph, the first functor picks out a Lagrangian relation in terms of "effort" and "flow," while the
second picks one out in terms of "potential" and "current." The natural transformation arises from
the way that effort and flow relate to potential and current.
