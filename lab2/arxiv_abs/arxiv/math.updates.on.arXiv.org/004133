We study the existence of various sign and value patterns in sequences defined by multiplicative
functions or related objects. For any set $A$ whose indicator function is 'approximately multiplicative'
and uniformly distributed on short intervals in a suitable sense, we show that the asymptotic density
of the pattern $n+1\in A$, $n+2\in A$, $n+3\in A$ is positive, as long as $A$ has density greater than
$\frac{1}{3}$. Using an inverse theorem for sumsets and some tools from ergodic theory, we also
provide a theorem that deals with the critical case of $A$ having density exactly $\frac{1}{3}$,
below which one would need nontrivial information on the local distribution of $A$ in Bohr sets to
proceed. We apply our results firstly to answer in a stronger form a question of Erd\H{o}s and Pomerance
on the relative orderings of the largest prime factors $P^{+}(n)$, $P^{+}(n+1), P^{+}(n+2)$ of
three consecutive integers. Secondly, we show that the tuple $(\omega(n+1),\omega(n+2),\omega(n+3))
\pmod 3$ takes all the $27$ possible patterns in $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^3$ with positive lower
density, with $\omega(n)$ being the number of distinct prime divisors. We also prove a theorem concerning
longer patterns $n+i\in A_i$, $i=1,\dots k$ in approximately multiplicative sets $A_i$ having
large enough densities, generalising some results of Hildebrand on his 'stable sets conjecture'.
Lastly, we consider the sign patterns of the Liouville function $\lambda$ and show that there are
at least $24$ patterns of length $5$ that occur with positive density. In all of the proofs we make
extensive use of recent ideas concerning correlations of multiplicative functions.
