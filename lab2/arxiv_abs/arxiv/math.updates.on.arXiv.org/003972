We propose subspace methods for 3-parameter eigenvalue problems. Such problems arise when separation
of variables is applied to separable boundary value problems; a particular example is the Helmholtz
equation in ellipsoidal and paraboloidal coordinates. While several subspace methods for 2-parameter
eigenvalue problems exist, their extensions to three parameter setting seem to be challenging.
An inherent difficulty is that, while for 2-parameter eigenvalue problems we can exploit a relation
to Sylvester equations to obtain a fast Arnoldi type method, such a relation does not seem to exist
when there are three or more parameters. Instead, we introduce a subspace iteration method with
projections onto generalized Krylov subspaces that are constructed from scratch at every iteration
using certain Ritz vectors as the initial vectors. Another possibility is a Jacobi--Davidson type
method for three or more parameters, which we generalize from its 2-parameter counterpart. For
both approaches, we introduce a selection criterion for deflation that is based on the angles between
left and right eigenvectors. The Jacobi--Davidson approach is devised to locate eigenvalues close
to a prescribed target, yet it often also performs well when eigenvalues are sought based on the proximity
of one of the components to a prescribed target. The subspace iteration method is devised specifically
for the latter task. The proposed approaches are suitable especially for problems where the computation
of several eigenvalues is required with high accuracy. Matlab implementations of both methods
have been made available in the package MultiParEig.
