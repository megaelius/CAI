Nonlinear differential equations rarely admit closed-form solutions, thus requiring numerical
time-stepping algorithms to approximate solutions. Further, many systems characterized by multiscale
physics exhibit dynamics over a vast range of timescales, making numerical integration computationally
expensive due to numerical stiffness. In this work, we develop a hierarchy of deep neural network
time-steppers to approximate the flow map of the dynamical system over a disparate range of time-scales.
The resulting model is purely data-driven and leverages features of the multiscale dynamics, enabling
numerical integration and forecasting that is both accurate and highly efficient. Moreover, similar
ideas can be used to couple neural network-based models with classical numerical time-steppers.
Our multiscale hierarchical time-stepping scheme provides important advantages over current
time-stepping algorithms, including (i) circumventing numerical stiffness due to disparate
time-scales, (ii) improved accuracy in comparison with leading neural-network architectures,
(iii) efficiency in long-time simulation/forecasting due to explicit training of slow time-scale
dynamics, and (iv) a flexible framework that is parallelizable and may be integrated with standard
numerical time-stepping algorithms. The method is demonstrated on a wide range of nonlinear dynamical
systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, the Lorenz system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and fluid flow pass a cylinder; audio and video signals are also explored. On the sequence generation
examples, we benchmark our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods, such as LSTM, reservoir
computing, and clockwork RNN. Despite the structural simplicity of our method, it outperforms
competing methods on numerical integration.
