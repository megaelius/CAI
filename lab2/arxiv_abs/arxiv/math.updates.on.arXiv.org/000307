A non-perturbative relativistic quantum Yang-Mills theory with a semisimple compact gauge Lie
group on the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is set up in a Schroedinger representation with
infinite-dimensional differential operators in the framework of sesqui-holomorphic nuclear
Kree-Gelfand triples. The \emph{linear} quantum Yang-Mills energy-mass operator $\mathbf{H}$
is defined as the anti-normal quantization of the \emph{non-linear} Yang-Mills energy-mass functional
of Cauchy data supported by a ball $\mathbb{B}(R)$ with the center at the origin of $\mathbb{R}^3$
and the variable radius R>0. The general global solution of the non-linear Yang-Mills system
of partial differential equations (with no restrictions at infinity) is reduced to the solution
of the initial value problems in the temporal gauge with the Cauchy data supported by the balls $\mathbb{B}(R)$.
It is shown that $\mathbf{H}$ dominates the number operator $\mathbf{N}$. Since 0 is the spectral
infimum of $\mathbf{H}$ and, simultaneously, the simple fundamental eigenvalue of $N$, variational
spectral principles imply that 0 is the simple fundamental eigenvalue of $N$ as well. Thus $\mathbf{H}$
has a positive mass gap. The domination proof depends crucially on the magic of the Killing quadratic
form that reveals a mass quadratic form in the Weyl symbol of $\mathbf{H}$. With a dimensional transmutation
of the coupling constant, the mass gap is proportional to 1/R and the running coupling constant is
proportional to $\sqrt{R}$. The inverse dependence demonstrates an asymptotic freedom for quantum
Yang-Mills self-interaction at short distances. The mathematically rigorous theory is non-perturbative
and provides a solution for the 7th Clay Institute Millennium problem.
