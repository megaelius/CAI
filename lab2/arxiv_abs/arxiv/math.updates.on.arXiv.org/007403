Partial information decomposition (PID) seeks to decompose the multivariate mutual information
that a set of source variables contains about a target variable into basic pieces, the so called "atoms
of information". Each atom describes a distinct way in which the sources may contain information
about the target. In this paper we show, first, that the entire theory of partial information decomposition
can be derived from considerations of elementary parthood relationships between information
contributions. This way of approaching the problem has the advantage of directly characterizing
the atoms of information, instead of taking an indirect approach via the concept of redundancy.
Secondly, we describe several intriguing links between PID and formal logic. In particular, we
show how to define a measure of PID based on the information provided by certain statements about
source realizations. Furthermore, we show how the mathematical lattice structure underlying
PID theory can be translated into an isomorphic structure of logical statements with a particularly
simple ordering relation: logical implication. The conclusion to be drawn from these considerations
is that there are three isomorphic "worlds" of partial information decomposition, i.e. three equivalent
ways to mathematically describe the decomposition of the information carried by a set of sources
about a target: the world of parthood relationships, the world of logical statements, and the world
of antichains that was utilized by Williams and Beer in their original exposition of PID theory.
We additionally show how the parthood perspective provides a systematic way to answer a type of question
that has been much discussed in the PID field: whether a partial information decomposition can be
uniquely determined based on concepts other than redundant information.
