The spectrum of the generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a diffusion process, referred to as the Ruelle-Pollicott
(RP) spectrum, provides a detailed characterization of correlation functions and power spectra
of stochastic systems via decomposition formulas in terms of RP resonances. Stochastic analysis
techniques relying on the theory of Markov semigroups for the study of the RP spectrum and a rigorous
reduction method is presented in Part I. This framework is here applied to study a stochastic Hopf
bifurcation in view of characterizing the statistical properties of nonlinear oscillators perturbed
by noise, depending on their stability. In light of the H\"ormander theorem, it is first shown that
the geometry of the unperturbed limit cycle, in particular its isochrons, is essential to understand
the effect of noise and the phenomenon of phase diffusion. In addition, it is shown that the spectrum
has a spectral gap, even at the bifurcation point, and that correlations decay exponentially fast.
Explicit small-noise expansions of the RP eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are then obtained, away
from the bifurcation point, based on the knowledge of the linearized deterministic dynamics and
the characteristics of the noise. These formulas allow one to understand how the interaction of
the noise with the deterministic dynamics affect the decay of correlations. Numerical results
complement the study of the RP spectrum at the bifurcation, revealing useful scaling laws. The analysis
of the Markov semigroup for stochastic bifurcations is thus promising in providing a complementary
approach to the more geometric random dynamical system approach. This approach is not limited to
low-dimensional systems and the reduction method presented in part I is applied to a stochastic
model relevant to climate dynamics in part III.
