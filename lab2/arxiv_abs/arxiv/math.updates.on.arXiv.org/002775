In this paper we use the Riemann-Hilbert problem, with jumps supported on appropriate curves in
the complex plane, for matrix biorthogonal polynomials and apply it to find Sylvester systems of
differential equations for the orthogonal polynomials and its second kind functions as well. For
this aim, Sylvester type differential Pearson equations for the matrix of weights are shown to be
instrumental. Several applications are given, in order of increasing complexity. First, a general
discussion of non-Abelian Hermite biorthogonal polynomials in the real line, understood as those
whose matrix of weights is a solution of a Sylvester type Pearson equation with coefficients first
order matrix polynomials, is given. All these is applied to the discussion of possible scenarios
leading to eigenvalue problems for second order linear differential operators with matrix eigenvalues.
Nonlinear matrix difference equations are discussed next. Firstly, for the general Hermite situation
a general non linear relation (non trivial because the non commutativity features of the setting)
for the recursion coefficients is gotten. In the next case of higher difficulty, degree two polynomials
are allowed in the Pearson equation, but the discussion is simplified by considering only a left
Pearson equation. In the case, the support of the measure is on an appropriate branch of an hyperbola.
The recursion coefficients are shown to fulfill a non-Abelian extension of the alternate discrete
Painlev\'e I equation. Finally, a discussion is given for the case of degree three polynomials as
coefficients in the left Pearson equation characterizing the matrix of weights. However, for simplicity
only odd polynomials are allowed. In this case, a new and more general matrix extension of the discrete
Painlev\'e I equation is found.
