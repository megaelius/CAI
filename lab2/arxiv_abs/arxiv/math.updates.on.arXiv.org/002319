In this paper, we investigate a rather general system of two operator equations that has the structure
of a viscous or nonviscous Cahn--Hilliard system in which nonlinearities of double-well type occur.
Standard cases like regular or logarithmic potentials, as well as non-differentiable potentials
involving indicator functions, are admitted. The operators appearing in the system equations
are fractional versions of general linear operators $A$ and $B$, where the latter are densely defined,
unbounded, self-adjoint and monotone in a Hilbert space of functions defined in a smooth domain
and have compact resolvents. We remark that our definition of the fractional power of operators
uses the approach via spectral theory. Typical cases are given by standard second-order elliptic
operators (e.g., the Laplacian) with zero Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, but also other
cases like fourth-order systems or systems involving the Stokes operator are covered by the theory.
We derive general well-posedness and regularity results that extend corresponding results which
are known for either the non-fractional Laplacian with zero Neumann boundary condition or the fractional
Laplacian with zero Dirichlet condition. These results are entirely new if at least one of the operators
$A$ and $B$ differs from the Laplacian. It turns out that the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of $A$
plays an important und not entirely obvious role: if $\lambda_1$ is positive, then the operators
$\,A\,$ and $\,B\,$ may be completely unrelated; if, however, $\lambda_1=0$, then it must be simple
and the corresponding one-dimensional eigenspace has to consist of the constant functions and
to be a subset of the domain of definition of a certain fractional power of $B$. We are able to show general
existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for both these cases, as well as for both the viscous
and the nonviscous system.
