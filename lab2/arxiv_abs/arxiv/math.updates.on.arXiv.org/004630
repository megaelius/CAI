The joint design of control and communication scheduling in a Networked Control System (NCS) is
known to be a hard problem. Several research works have successfully designed optimal sampling
and/or control strategies under simplified communication models, where transmission delays/times
are negligible or fixed. However, considering sophisticated communication models, with random
transmission times, result in highly coupled and difficult-to-solve optimal design problems
due to the parameter inter-dependencies between estimation/control and communication layers.
To tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate the applicability of Age-of-Information (AoI)
for solving control/estimation problems in an NCS under i.i.d. transmission times. Our motivation
for this investigation stems from the following facts: 1) recent results indicate that AoI can be
tackled under relatively sophisticated communication models, and 2) a lower AoI in an NCS may result
in a lower estimation/control cost. We study a joint optimization of sampling and scheduling for
a single-loop stochastic LTI networked system with the objective of minimizing the time-average
squared norm of the estimation error. We first show that under mild assumptions on information structure
the optimal control policy can be designed independently from the sampling and scheduling policies.
We then derive a key result that minimizing the estimation error is equivalent to minimizing a function
of AoI when the sampling decisions are independent of the state of the LTI system. Noting that minimizing
the function of AoI is a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem and is hard to solve, we resort
to heuristic algorithms obtained by extending existing algorithms in the AoI literature. We also
identify a class of LTI system dynamics for which minimizing the estimation error is equivalent
to minimizing the expected AoI.
