In this paper we will show the duality between the range test (RT) and no-response test (NRT) for the
inverse boundary value problem for the Laplace equation in $\Omega\setminus\overline D$ with
an obstacle $D\Subset\Omega$ whose boundary $\partial D$ is visible from the boundary $\partial\Omega$
of $\Omega$ and a measurement is given as a set of Cauchy data on $\partial\Omega$. Here the Cauchy
data is given by a unique solution $u$ of the boundary value problem for the Laplace equation in $\Omega\setminus\overline
D$ with homogeneous and inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial D$ and $\partial\Omega$,
respectively. These testing methods are domain sampling method to estimate the location of the
obstacle using test domains and the associated indicator functions. Also both of these testing
methods can test the analytic extension of $u$ to the exterior of a test domain. Since these methods
are defined via some operators which are dual to each other, we could expect that there is a duality
between the two methods. We will give this duality in terms of the equivalence of the pre-indicator
functions associated to their indicator functions. As an application of the duality, the reconstruction
of $D$ using the RT gives the reconstruction of $D$ using the NRT and vice versa. We will also give each
of these reconstructions without using the duality if the Dirichlet data of the Cauchy data on $\partial\Omega$
is not identically zero and the solution to the associated forward problem does not have any analytic
extension across $\partial D$. Moreover, we will show that these methods can still give the reconstruction
of $D$ if $D$ is a convex polygon and it satisfies one of the following two properties: all of its corner
angles are irrational and its diameter is less than its distance to $\partial\Omega$.
