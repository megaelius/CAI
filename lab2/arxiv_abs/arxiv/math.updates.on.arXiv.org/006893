Consider the projection of an $n$-dimensional random vector onto a random $k_n$-dimensional basis,
$k_n \leq n$, drawn uniformly from the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal $k_n$-frames
in $\mathbb{R}^n$, in three different asymptotic regimes as $n \rightarrow \infty$: "constant"
($k_n=k$), "sublinear" ($k_n \rightarrow \infty$ but $k_n/n \rightarrow 0$) and "linear" $k_n/n
\rightarrow \lambda$ with $0 < \lambda \le 1$). When the sequence of random vectors satisfies a certain
"asymptotic thin shell condition", we establish annealed large deviation principles (LDPs) for
the corresponding sequence of random projections in the constant regime, and for the sequence of
empirical measures of the coordinates of the random projections in the sublinear and linear regimes.
We also establish LDPs for certain scaled $\ell_q$ norms of the random projections in these different
regimes. Moreover, we verify our assumptions for various sequences of random vectors of interest,
including those distributed according to Gibbs measures with superquadratic interaction potential,
or the uniform measure on suitably scaled $\ell_p^n$ balls, for $p \in [1,\infty)$, and generalized
Orlicz balls defined via a superquadratic function. Our results complement the central limit theorem
for convex sets and related results which are known to hold under a "thin shell" condition. These
results also substantially extend existing large deviation results for random projections, which
are first, restricted to the setting of measures on $\ell_p^n$ balls, and secondly, limited to univariate
LDPs (i.e., in $\mathbb{R}$) involving either the norm of a $k_n$-dimensional projection or the
projection of $X^{(n)}$ onto a random one-dimensional subspace. Random projections of high-dimensional
random vectors are of interest in a range of fields including asymptotic convex geometry and high-dimensional
statistics.
