Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is anticipated to be widely applied in the forthcoming
fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, due to its many advantages such as low cost, high mobility,
and on-demand deployment. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight (LoS) nature of air-to-ground
wireless channels gives rise to a new challenge on how to realize secure UAV communications with
the destined nodes on the ground. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by applying the physical
(PHY) layer security technique. We consider both the downlink and uplink UAV communications with
a ground node, namely UAV-to-ground (U2G) and ground-to-UAV (G2U) communication, respectively,
subject to a potential eavesdropper on the ground. In contrast to the existing literature on wireless
PHY layer security only with ground nodes at fixed or quasi-static locations, we exploit the high
mobility of the UAV to proactively establish favorable and degraded channels for the legitimate
and eavesdropping links, respectively, via its trajectory design. We formulate new problems to
maximize the average secrecy rates of the U2G and G2U transmissions, respectively, by jointly optimizing
the UAV's trajectory and the transmit power of the legitimate transmitter over a given flight period
of the UAV. Although the formulated problems are non-convex, we propose iterative algorithms to
solve them efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization
methods. Specifically, the transmit power and UAV trajectory are each optimized with the other
being fixed in an alternating manner, until they converge. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithms can improve the secrecy rates for both U2G and G2U communications, as compared to other
benchmark schemes without power control and/or trajectory optimization.
