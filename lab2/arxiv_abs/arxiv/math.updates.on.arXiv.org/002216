The first half of the thesis concerns Abelian vortices and Yang-Mills (YM) theory. It is proved that
the 5 types of vortices recently proposed by Manton are symmetry reductions of (A)SDYM equations
with suitable gauge groups and symmetry groups acting as isometries in a 4-manifold. As a consequence,
the twistor integrability results of such vortices can be derived. It is presented a natural definition
of their kinetic energy and thus the metric of the moduli space was calculated by the Samols' localisation
method. Then, a modified version of the Abelian-Higgs model is proposed in such a way that spontaneous
symmetry breaking and the Bogomolny argument still hold. The Painlev\'e test, when applied to its
soliton equations, reveals a complete list of its integrable cases. The corresponding solutions
are given in terms of third Painlev\'e transcendents and can be interpreted as original vortices
on surfaces with conical singularity. The last two chapters present the following results in projective
differential geometry and Hamiltonians of hydrodynamic-type (HT) systems. It is shown that the
projective structures defined by the Painlev\'e equations are not metrisable unless either the
corresponding equations admit first integrals quadratic in first derivatives or they define projectively
flat structures. The corresponding first integrals can be derived from Killing vectors associated
to the metrics that solve the metrisability problem. Secondly, it is given a complete set of necessary
and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary affine connection in 2D to admit, locally, 0, 1, 2 or 3
Killing forms. These conditions are tensorial and simpler than the ones in previous literature.
By defining suitable affine connections, it is shown that the problem of existence of Killing forms
is equivalent to the conditions of the existence of Hamiltonian structures for HT systems of two
components.
