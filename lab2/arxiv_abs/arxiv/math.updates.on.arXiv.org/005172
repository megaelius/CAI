Parallel-in-time methods, such as multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) and Parareal, provide
an attractive option for increasing concurrency when simulating time-dependent PDEs in modern
high-performance computing environments. While these techniques have been very successful for
parabolic equations, it has often been observed that their performance suffers dramatically when
applied to advection-dominated problems or purely hyperbolic PDEs using standard rediscretization
approaches on coarse grids. In this paper, we apply MGRIT or Parareal to the constant-coefficient
linear advection equation, appealing to existing convergence theory to provide insight into the
typically non-scalable or even divergent behaviour of these solvers for this problem. To overcome
these failings, we replace rediscretization on coarse grids with near-optimal coarse-grid operators
that are computed by applying optimization techniques to approximately minimize error estimates
from the convergence theory. Our main finding is that, in order to obtain fast convergence as for
parabolic problems, coarse-grid operators should take into account the behaviour of the hyperbolic
problem by tracking the characteristic curves. Our approach is tested on discretizations of various
orders that use explicit or implicit Runge-Kutta time integration with upwind-finite-difference
spatial discretizations, for which we obtain fast and scalable convergence in all cases. Parallel
tests also demonstrate significant speed-ups over sequential time-stepping. Our insight of tracking
characteristics on coarse grids is implemented for linear advection using an optimization approach,
but the principle is general, and provides a key idea for solving the long-standing problem of efficient
parallel-in-time integration for hyperbolic PDEs.
