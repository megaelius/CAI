Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a well-known decision support tool that can be used
in a wide variety of contexts. It is particularly useful for territorial planning in situations
where several actors with different, and sometimes contradictory, point of views have to take a
decision regarding land use development. While the impact of the weights used to represent the relative
importance of criteria has been widely studied in the recent literature, the impact of order weights
determination have rarely been investigated. This paper presents a spatial sensitivity analysis
to assess the impact of order weights determination in Multi-Criteria Analysis by Ordered Weighted
Averaging. We propose a methodology based on an efficient exploration of the decision-strategy
space defined by the level of risk and trade-off in the decision process. We illustrate our approach
with a land use planning process in the South of France. The objective is to find suitable areas for
urban development while preserving green areas and their associated ecosystem services. The ecosystem
service approach has indeed the potential to widen the scope of traditional landscape-ecological
planning by including ecosystem-based benefits, including social and economic benefits, green
infrastructures and biophysical parameters in urban and territorial planning. We show that in
this particular case the decision-strategy space can be divided into four clusters. Each of them
is associated with a map summarizing the average spatial suitability distribution used to identify
potential areas for urban development. We finally demonstrate the pertinence of a spatial variance
within-cluster analysis to disentangle the relationship between risk and trade-off values.
