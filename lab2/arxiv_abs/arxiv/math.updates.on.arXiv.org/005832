In Part I of this article we generalize the Linearized Doubling (LD) approach which has been introduced
by NK, to apply (under reasonable assumptions) to doubling arbitrary closed minimal surfaces in
arbitrary Riemannian three-manifolds without any symmetry requirements. More precisely assume
given a family of LD solutions on a closed minimal surface $\Sigma$ embedded in a Riemannian three-manifold,
where an LD solution $\varphi$ is a solution with logarithmic singularities of the linearized equation
$(\Delta+|A|^2+\Ric(\nu,\nu)\,)\varphi =0$ on $\Sigma$. We prove a general theorem which states
that if the family satisfies certain conditions, then a new minimal surface can be constructed via
doubling, with catenoidal bridges replacing the singularities of one of the LD solutions. Surprisingly
the lack of symmetry does not affect the nature of the families of LD solutions required. The proof
of the theorem and the construction however require many new ideas. The construction of the required
LD solutions is currently understood only when $\Sigma$ and the ambient manifold possess $O(2)$
symmetry and the number of bridges is chosen large enough along $O(2)$ orbits. In this spirit, in
Part II of this article we combine the theorem in Part I with the LD solutions constructed in our earlier
work, with appropriate minor modifications, to construct new self-shrinkers of the mean curvature
flow via doubling the spherical self-shrinker and new complete embedded minimal surfaces of finite
total curvature in the Euclidean three-space via doubling the catenoid. Furthermore in a continuation
under preparation of this article, we construct new self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow via
doubling the Angenent torus and new free boundary minimal surfaces in the unit ball via doubling
the critical catenoid.
