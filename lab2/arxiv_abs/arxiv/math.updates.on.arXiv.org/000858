The conformal powers of the Laplacian of a Riemannian metric which are known as the GJMS-operators
admit a combinatorial description in terms of the Taylor coefficients of a natural second-order
one-parameter family $\H(r;g)$ of self-adjoint elliptic differential operators. $\H(r;g)$
is a non-Laplace-type perturbation of the conformal Laplacian $P_2(g) = \H(0;g)$. It is defined
in terms of the metric $g$ and covariant derivatives of the curvature of $g$. We study the heat kernel
coefficients $a_{2k}(r;g)$ of $\H(r;g)$ on closed manifolds. We prove general structural results
for the heat kernel coefficients $a_{2k}(r;g)$ and derive explicit formulas for $a_0(r)$ and $a_2(r)$
in terms of renormalized volume coefficients. The Taylor coefficients of $a_{2k}(r;g)$ (as functions
of $r$) interpolate between the renormalized volume coefficients of a metric $g$ ($k=0$) and the
heat kernel coefficients of the conformal Laplacian of $g$ ($r=0$). Although $\H(r;g)$ is not conformally
covariant, there is a beautiful formula for the conformal variation of the trace of its heat kernel.
As a consequence, we give a heat equation proof of the conformal transformation law of the integrated
renormalized volume coefficients. By refining these arguments, we also give a heat equation proof
of the conformal transformation law of the renormalized volume coefficients itself. The Taylor
coefficients of $a_2(r)$ define a sequence of higher-order Riemannian curvature functionals
with extremal properties at Einstein metrics which are analogous to those of integrated renormalized
volume coefficients. Among the various additional results the reader finds a Polyakov-type formula
for the renormalized volume of a Poincar\'e-Einstein metric in terms of $Q$-curvature of its conformal
infinity and additional holographic terms.
