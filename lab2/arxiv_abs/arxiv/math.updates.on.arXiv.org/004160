We generalize the notion of SRB measures and characterize their existence, uniqueness, and ergodic,
thermodynamic, and physical properties. We show that there exists a generalized SRB measure (GSRB
for short) if and only if there exists some unstable leaf with a positive leaf volume for the set of
hyperbolic points $\mathrm{HWT}_\chi$ (which are not necessarily Lyapunov regular). This condition
is called the leaf condition. We show that the leaf condition also implies that the Gurevich pressure
of the geometric potential is 0, and characterize all GSRBs as equilibrium states of the geometric
potential, which gives the analogue to the entropy formula. Every finite GSRB is an SRB, and the finiteness
of GSRBs is characterized by modes of recurrence of the geometric potential. We define a set of positively
recurrent points, and characterize positive recurrence of the geometric potential by the leaf
condition for the said points. We show the uniqueness of GSRBs on each ergodic homoclinic class,
and that each ergodic component of a GSRB is a GSRB. In particular, this offers new proofs for the entropy
formula and for the uniqueness of hyperbolic SRB measures, and for the fact that an ergodic component
of a hyperbolic SRB measure is a hyperbolic SRB measure. We show physical properties for GSRBs (w.r.t.
the ratio ergodic theorem, and by distributions). In our setup, $M$ is a Riemannian, boundaryless,
and compact manifold, with $\dim M\geq 2$; $f\in \mathrm{Diff}^{1+\beta}(M), \beta>0$. We demonstrate
the relevance of GSRBs by analyzing an example of an "almost Anosov" system by Hu and Young, with no
SRB measures, and show that it admits a GSRB. These results offer an extension to the Viana conjecture,
and serve as a partial answer to the Viana conjecture, and to its extension.
