We consider numerical methods for the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Cahn-Hilliard (PNPCH) equations
with steric interactions. We propose a novel energy stable numerical scheme that respects mass
conservation and positivity at the discrete level. Existence and uniqueness of the solution to
the proposed nonlinear scheme are established by showing that the solution is a unique minimizer
of a convex functional over a closed, convex domain. The positivity of numerical solutions is further
theoretically justified by the singularity of the entropy terms, which prevents the minimizer
from approaching zero concentrations. A further numerical analysis proves discrete free-energy
dissipation. Extensive numerical tests are performed to validate that the numerical scheme is
first-order accurate in time and second-order accurate in space, and is capable of preserving the
desired properties, such as mass conservation, positivity, and free energy dissipation, at the
discrete level. Moreover, the PNPCH equations and the proposed scheme are applied to study charge
dynamics and self-assembled nanopatterns in highly concentrated electrolytes that are widely
used in electrochemical energy devices. Numerical results demonstrate that the PNPCH equations
and our numerical scheme are able to capture nanostructures, such as lamellar patterns and labyrinthine
patterns in electric double layers and the bulk, and multiple time relaxation with multiple time
scales. In addition, we numerically characterize the interplay between cross steric interactions
of short range and the concentration gradient regularization, and their impact on the development
of nanostructures in the equilibrium state.
