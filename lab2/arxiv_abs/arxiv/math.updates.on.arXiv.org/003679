A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric neighboring interference (SNI) has
$K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_{k}$ wanting the $k$th message $x_{k}$ and
having the interference with $D$ messages after and $U$ messages before its desired message. Maleki,
Cadambe and Jafar studied SUICP(SNI) because of its importance in topological interference management
problems. Maleki \textit{et. al.} derived the lowerbound on the broadcast rate of this setting
to be $D+1$. In our earlier work, for SUICP(SNI) with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$, we defined set $\mathbf{S}$
of 2-tuples and for every $(a,b) \in \mathbf{S}$, we constructed $b$-dimensional vector linear
index code with rate $D+1+\frac{a}{b}$ by using an encoding matrix of dimension $Kb \times (b(D+1)+a)$.
In this paper, we use the symmetric structure of the SUICP(SNI) to reduce the size of encoding matrix
by partitioning the message symbols. The rate achieved in this paper is same as that of the existing
constructions of vector linear index codes. More specifically, we construct $b$-dimensional
vector linear index codes for SUICP(SNI) by partitioning the $Kb$ messages into $b(U+1)+c$ sets
for some non-negative integer $c$. We use an encoding matrix of size $\frac{Kb}{b(U+1)+c} \times
\frac{b(D+1)+a}{b(U+1)+c}$ to encode each partition separately. The advantage of this method
is that the receivers need to store atmost $\frac{b(D+1)+a}{b(U+1)+c}$ number of broadcast symbols
(index code symbols) to decode a given wanted message symbol. We also give a construction of scalar
linear index codes for SUICP(SNI) with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$. We give an improved upperbound on
the braodcast rate of SUICP(SNI).
