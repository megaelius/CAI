We study 4 problems in the area of scattering of time harmonic acoustic or electromagnetic waves
by unbounded rough surfaces/inhomogeneous layers. Specifically we study: i) a boundary value
problem (BVP) for the Helmholtz equation, in both 2 and 3 dimensions, modelling scattering of time
harmonic waves due to a source that lies within a finite distance of the boundary and which decays
along the boundary, by a layer of spatially varying refractive index above an unbounded rough surface
on which the field vanishes; ii) a BVP for the Helmholtz equation with an impedance boundary condition,
in 2 and 3 dimensions, modelling the scattering of time harmonic acoustic waves due to a source that
lies within a finite distance of the boundary and which decays along the boundary, by an unbounded
rough impedance surface; iii) a problem of scattering of time harmonic waves by a layer of spatially
varying refractive index at the interface between semi-infinite half-spaces of fixed positive
refractive index (the waves arising due to a source that lies within a finite distance of the layer
and which decays along the layer); iv) a BVP for the Helmholtz equation with a Dirichlet boundary
condition, in 3 dimensions, modelling the scattering of time harmonic acoustic waves due to a point
source, by an unbounded, rough, sound soft surface. We study i), ii) and iii) by variational methods;
via analysis of equivalent variational formulations we prove these problems to be well-posed under
various restrictions on the surface (must be Lipschitz), the frequency, the rate of change of the
refractive index etc. We study iv) via a Brakhage-Werner type integral equation formulation, based
on an ansatz for the solution as a combined single- and double-layer potential. We establish that
when the rough surface is the graph of a Lipschitz function, the problem is well-posed for arbitrary
frequency.
