Hybrid beamforming is known to be a cost-effective and wide-spread solution for a system with large-scale
antenna arrays. This work studies the optimization of the analog and digital components of the hybrid
beamforming solution for remote radio heads (RRHs) in a downlink cloud radio access network (C-RAN)
architecture. Digital processing is carried out at a baseband processing unit (BBU) in the "cloud"
and the precoded baseband signals are quantized prior to transmission to the RRHs via finite-capacity
fronthaul links. In this system, we consider two different channel state information (CSI) scenarios:
1) ideal CSI at the BBU 2) imperfect effective CSI. Optimization of digital beamforming and fronthaul
quantization strategies at the BBU as well as analog radio frequency (RF) beamforming at the RRHs
is a coupled problem, since the effect of the quantization noise at the receiver depends on the precoding
matrices. The resulting joint optimization problem is examined with the goal of maximizing the
weighted downlink sum-rate and the network energy efficiency. Fronthaul capacity and per-RRH
power constraints are enforced along with constant modulus constraint on the RF beamforming matrices.
For the case of perfect CSI, a block coordinate descent scheme is proposed based on the weighted minimum-mean-square-error
approach by relaxing the constant modulus constraint of the analog beamformer. Also, we present
the impact of imperfect CSI on the weighted sum-rate and network energy efficiency performance,
and the algorithm is extended by applying the sample average approximation. Numerical results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and show that the proposed algorithm is robust
to estimation errors.
