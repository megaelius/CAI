Wireless energy transfer (WET) is potentially a promising solution to provide convenient and reliable
energy supplies for energy-constrained networks, and has drawn growing interests recently. To
overcome the significant prorogation loss over distance, employing multi-antennas at the energy
transmitter (ET) to more efficiently direct wireless energy to desired energy receivers (ERs),
termed \emph{energy beamforming}, is an essential technique for WET. However, the achievable
gain of energy beamforming crucially depends on the available channel state information (CSI)
at the ET, which needs to be acquired practically. In this paper, we study the optimal design of one
efficient channel-acquisition method for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) WET system, by exploiting the channel reciprocity based on which the ET estimates the CSI
via dedicated reverse-link training from the ER. Considering the limited energy availability
at the ER, the training strategy should be carefully designed so that the channel can be estimated
with sufficient accuracy, and yet without consuming excessive energy at the ER. To this end, we propose
to maximize the net energy at the ER, which is the total energy harvested offset by that used for channel
training. The optimal training design, including the number of receive antennas to be trained,
as well as the training time and power allocated, is derived. Our result shows that training helps
only when either the channel coherence time, or the number of antennas at the ET, or the effective
signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR), is sufficiently large; otherwise, no training should be applied
and isotropic energy transmission is optimal.
