The ADM formalism together with a constant mean curvature (CMC) temporal gauge is used to derive
the monotonic decay of a weak Lyapunov function of the Einstein dynamical equations in an expanding
universe with a positive cosmological constant and matter sources satisfying suitable energy
conditions. While such a Lyapunov function does not, in general, represent a true Hamiltonian of
the matter-coupled gravity dynamics (unlike in the vacuum case when it does), it can nevertheless
be used to study the asymptotic behavior of the spacetimes. The Lyapunov function attains its infimum
only in the limit that the matter sources be `turned off` or, at least, become asymptotically negligible
provided that the universe model does not re-collapse and form singularities. Later we specialize
our result to the case of a perfect fluid which satisfies the desired energy conditions. However,
even in this special case, we show using Shutz's velocity potential formalism cast into Hamiltonian
form that unlike the vacuum spacetimes (with or without a positive cosmological constant), construction
of a true Hamiltonian for the dynamics in constant mean curvature temporal gauge is difficult and
therefore the Lyapunov function does not have a straightforward physical interpretation. Nevertheless,
we show, for the fluid with equation of state $P=(\gamma-1)\rho$ ($1\leq\gamma\leq2$), that the
general results obtained hold true and the infimum of the weak Lyapunov function can be related to
the Sigma constant, a topological invariant of the manifold. Utilizing these results, some general
conclusions are drawn regarding the asymptotic state of the universe and the dynamical control
of the allowed spatial topologies in the cosmological models.
