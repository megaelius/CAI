An analogy framework between wiretap channels (WTCs) and state-dependent point-to-point channels
with non-causal encoder channel state information (referred to as Gelfand-Pinker channels (GPCs))
is proposed. A good sequence of stealth-wiretap codes is shown to induce a good sequence of codes
for a corresponding GPC. Consequently, the framework enables exploiting existing results for
GPCs to produce converse proofs for their wiretap analogs. The analogy readily extends to multiuser
broadcasting scenarios, encompassing broadcast channels (BCs) with deterministic components,
degradation ordering between users, and BCs with cooperative receivers. Given a wiretap BC (WTBC)
with two receivers and one eavesdropper, an analogous Gelfand-Pinsker BC (GPBC) is constructed
by converting the eavesdropper's observation sequence into a state sequence with an appropriate
product distribution (induced by the stealth-wiretap code for the WTBC), and non-causally revealing
the states to the encoder. The transition matrix of the state-dependent GPBC is extracted from WTBC's
transition law, with the eavesdropper's output playing the role of the channel state. Past capacity
results for the semi-deterministic (SD) GPBC and the physically-degraded (PD) GPBC with an informed
receiver are leveraged to furnish analogy-based converse proofs for the analogous WTBC setups.
This characterizes the secrecy-capacity regions of the SD-WTBC and the PD-WTBC, in which the stronger
receiver also observes the eavesdropper's channel output. These derivations exemplify how the
wiretap-GP analogy enables translating results on one problem into advances in the study of the
other.
