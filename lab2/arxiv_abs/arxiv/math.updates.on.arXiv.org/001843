Designing good error correcting codes whose generator matrix has a support constraint, i.e., one
for which only certain entries of the generator matrix are allowed to be non-zero, has found many
recent applications, including in distributed coding and storage, multiple access networks,
and weakly secure data exchange. The dual problem, where the parity check matrix has a support constraint,
comes up in the design of locally repairable codes. The central problem here is to design codes with
the largest possible minimum distance, subject to the given support constraint on the generator
matrix. An upper bound on the minimum distance can be obtained through a set of singleton bounds,
which can be alternatively thought of as a cut-set bound. Furthermore, it is well known that, if the
field size is large enough, any random generator matrix obeying the support constraint will achieve
the maximum minimum distance with high probability. Since random codes are not easy to decode, structured
codes with efficient decoders, e.g., Reed-Solomon codes, are much more desirable. The GM-MDS conjecture
of Dau et al states that the maximum minimum distance over all codes satisfying the generator matrix
support constraint can be obtained by a Reed Solomon code. If true, this would have significant consequences.
The conjecture has been proven for several special case: when the dimension of the code k is less than
or equal to five, when the number of distinct support sets on the rows of the generator matrix m, say,
is less than or equal to three, or when the generator matrix is sparsest and balanced. In this paper,
we report on further progress on the GM-MDS conjecture. In particular, we show that the conjecture
is true for all m less than equal to six. This generalizes all previous known results (except for the
sparsest and balanced case, which is a very special support constraint).
