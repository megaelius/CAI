A result of P\'olya states that every sequence of quadrature formulas $Q_n(f)$ with $n$ nodes and
positive numbers converges to the integral $I(f)$ of a continuous function $f$ provided $Q_n(f)=I(f)$
for a space of algebraic polynomials of certain degree that depends on $n$. The classical case when
the algebraic degree of precision is the highest possible is well-known and the quadrature formulas
are the Gaussian ones whose nodes coincide with the zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials
and the numbers are expressed in terms of the so-called kernel polynomials. In many cases it is reasonable
to relax the requirement for the highest possible degree of precision in order to gain the possibility
to either approximate integrals of more specific continuous functions that contain a polynomial
factor or to include additional fixed nodes. The construction of such quadrature processes is related
to quasi-orthogonal polynomials. Given a sequence $\left \{ P_{n}\right \}_{n\geq0}$ of monic
orthogonal polynomials and a fixed integer $k$, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions
so that the quasi-orthogonal polynomials $\left \{ Q_{n}\right \}_{n\geq0}$ defined by \[ Q_{n}(x)
=P_{n}(x) + \sum \limits_{i=1}^{k-1} b_{i,n}P_{n-i}(x), \ \ n\geq 0, \] with $b_{i,n} \in \mathbb{R}$,
and $b_{k-1,n}\neq 0$ for $n\geq k-1$, also constitute a sequence of orthogonal polynomials. Therefore
we solve the inverse problem for linearly related orthogonal polynomials. The characterization
turns out to be equivalent to some nice recurrence formulas for the coefficients $b_{i,n}$. We employ
these results to establish explicit relations between various types of quadrature rules from the
above relations. A number of illustrative examples are provided.
