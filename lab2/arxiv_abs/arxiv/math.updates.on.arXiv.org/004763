In this paper we present mutual coinduction as a dual of mutual induction and also as a generalization
of standard coinduction. In particular, we present a precise formal definition of mutual induction
and mutual coinduction. In the process we present the associated mutual induction and mutual coinduction
proof principles, and we present the conditions under which these principles hold. In spite of some
mention of mutual (co)induction in research literature, but the formal definition of mutual (co)induction
and the proof of the mutual (co)induction proof principles we present here seem to be the first such
definition and proof. As such, it seems our work is the first to point out that monotonicity of mutual
generators seems not sufficient for guaranteeing the existence of least and greatest simultaneous
fixed points in complete lattices, and that continuity on the other hand is sufficient for guaranteeing
their existence. [The paper has been responsively updated so as to not require the continuity of
generators but only require their monotonicity, and it now includes a proof of the sufficiency of
monotonicity. A full revision of the paper to reflect the relaxed requirement is currently underway.]
In the course of our presentation of mutual coinduction we also discuss some concepts related to
standard (also called direct) induction and standard coinduction, as well as ones related to mutual
(also called simultaneous or indirect) induction. During the presentation we purposely discuss
particular standard concepts so as to help motivate the definitions of their more general counterparts
for mutual/ simultaneous/ indirect (co)induction. Greatest simultaneous post-fixed points,
in particular, will be abstractions and models of mathematical objects (e.g., points, sets, types,
predicates, etc.) that are defined mutually-coinductively.
