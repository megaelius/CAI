Fix any $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$. We say that a set $S\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ is $\lambda$-$convex$
if, whenever $a$ and $b$ are in $S$, the point $(1-\lambda)a+\lambda b$ is also in $S$. If $S$ is also
(topologically) closed, then we say that $S$ is $\lambda$-$clonvex$. We investigate the properties
of $\lambda$-convex and $\lambda$-clonvex sets and prove a number of facts about them. Letting
$R_\lambda\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ be the least $\lambda$-clonvex superset of $\{0,1\}$, we show
that if $R_\lambda$ is convex in the usual sense, then $R_\lambda$ must be either $[0,1]$ or $\mathbb{R}$
or $\mathbb{C}$, depending on $\lambda$. We investigate which $\lambda$ make $R_\lambda$ convex,
derive a number of conditions equivalent to $R_\lambda$ being convex, and give several conditions
sufficient for $R_\lambda$ to be convex or not convex; in particular, we show that $R_\lambda$ is
either convex or uniformly discrete. Letting $\mathcal{C} := \{\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\mid \mbox{$R_\lambda$
is convex}\}$, we show that $\mathcal{C}$ is open and contains all transcendental $\lambda$. It
follows that $\mathbb{C} \setminus \mathcal{C}$ is countable, closed, and nowhere dense. We also
give a sufficient condition on $\lambda$ for $R_\lambda$ and some other related $\lambda$-convex
sets to be discrete by introducing the notion of a strong PV number. These conditions give rise to
a number of periodic and aperiodic Meyer sets (the latter sometimes known as ``quasicrystals'').
The paper is in four parts. Part I describes basic properties of $\lambda$-convex and $\lambda$-clonvex
sets, including convexity versus uniform discreteness. Part II explores connections between
$\lambda$-convex sets and quasicrystals and displays a number of such sets, including several
with dihedral symmetry. Part III generalizes a result from Part I, and Part IV contains our conclusions
and open problems.
