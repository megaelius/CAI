This manuscript presents a fast direct solution technique for solving two dimensional wave scattering
problems from quasi-periodic multilayered structures. The fast solver is built from the linear
system that results from the discretization of a boundary integral formulation that is robust at
Wood's anomalies. When the interface geometries are complex, the linear system is too large to be
handled via dense linear algebra. The key building block of the proposed solver is a fast direct direct
solver for the large sparse block system that corresponds to the discretization of boundary integral
equations. The solver makes use of hierarchical matrix inversion techniques, has a cost that scales
linearly with respect to the number of unknowns on the interfaces and the precomputation can be used
for all choices of boundary data. By partitioning the remainder of the precomputation into parts
based on their dependence on incident angle, the proposed direct solver is efficient for problems
involving many incident angles like those that arise in applications. For example for a problem
on an eleven layer geometry where the solution is desired for 287 incident angles, the proposed solution
technique is 87 times faster than building a new fast direct solver for each new incident angle. An
additional feature of the proposed solution technique is that solving a problem where an interface
or layer property is changed require an update in the precomputation that cost linearly with respect
to the number points on the affected interfaces with a small constant prefactor. The efficiency
for modified geometries and multiple solves make the solution technique well suited for optimal
design and inverse scattering applications.
