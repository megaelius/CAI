The steady-state Poisson-Nernst-Planck (ssPNP) equations are an effective model for the description
of ionic transport in ion channels. It is observed that an ion channel exhibits voltage-dependent
switching between open and closed states. Different conductance states of a channel imply that
the ssPNP equations probably have multiple solutions with different level of currents. We propose
numerical approaches to study multiple solutions to the ssPNP equations with multiple ionic species.
To find complete current-voltage (I-V ) and current-concentration (I-C) curves, we reformulate
the ssPNP equations into four different boundary value problems (BVPs). Numerical continuation
approaches are developed to provide good initial guesses for iteratively solving algebraic equations
resulting from discretization. Numerical continuations on V , I, and boundary concentrations
result in S-shaped and double S-shaped (I-V and I-C) curves for the ssPNP equations with multiple
species of ions. There are five solutions to the ssPNP equations with five ionic species, when an
applied voltage is given in certain intervals. Remarkably, the current through ion channels responds
hysteretically to varying applied voltages and boundary concentrations, showing a memory effect.
In addition, we propose a useful computational approach to locate turning points of an I-V curve.
With obtained locations, we are able to determine critical threshold values for hysteresis to occur
and the interval for V in which the ssPNP equations have multiple solutions. Our numerical results
indicate that the developed numerical approaches have a promising potential in studying hysteretic
conductance states of ion channels.
