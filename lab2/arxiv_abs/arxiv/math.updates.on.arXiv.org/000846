We introduce an accurate and robust technique for accessing causality of network transfer functions
given in the form of bandlimited discrete frequency responses. These transfer functions are commonly
used to represent the electrical response of high speed digital interconnects used on chip and in
electronic package assemblies. In some cases small errors in the model development lead to non-causal
behavior that does not accurately represent the electrical response and may lead to a lack of convergence
in simulations that utilize these models. The approach is based on Hilbert transform relations
or Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations and a construction of causal Fourier continuations using
a regularized singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Given a transfer function, non-periodic
in general, this procedure constructs highly accurate Fourier series approximations on the given
frequency interval by allowing the function to be periodic in an extended domain. The causality
dispersion relations are enforced spectrally and exactly. This eliminates the necessity of approximating
the transfer function behavior at infinity and explicit computation of the Hilbert transform.
We perform the error analysis of the method and take into account a possible presence of a noise or
approximation errors in data. The developed error estimates can be used in verifying causality
of the given data. The performance of the method is tested on several analytic and simulated examples
that demonstrate an excellent accuracy and reliability of the proposed technique in agreement
with the obtained error estimates. The method is capable of detecting very small localized causality
violations with amplitudes close to the machine precision.
