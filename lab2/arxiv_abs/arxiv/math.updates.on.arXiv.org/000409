Linear encoders with good joint spectra are good candidates for lossless joint source-channel
coding (JSCC), where the joint spectrum is a variant of the input-output complete weight distribution
and is considered good if it is close to the average joint spectrum of all linear encoders (of the same
coding rate). However, in spite of their existence, it is still unknown how to construct such encoders
in practice. This paper is devoted to their construction. In particular, two families of linear
encoders are presented and proved to have good joint spectra. The first family is derived from Gabidulin
codes, a class of maximum-rank-distance (MRD) codes. The second family is constructed using a serial
concatenation of an inner low-density generator matrix (LDGM) encoder and an outer encoder of a
low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. Further, general criteria for good linear encoders are
reviewed and discussed in detail for three particular cases: lossless source coding, channel coding,
and lossless JSCC. In the framework of the code-spectrum approach, it is shown that these three scenarios
correspond to the problems of constructing linear encoders with good kernel spectra, good image
spectra, and good joint spectra, respectively. Moreover, it is shown that good joint spectra imply
both good kernel spectra and good image spectra. This fact establishes the fundamental role of linear
encoders with good joint spectra. Conversely, it is proved that there exist linear encoders not
only with good joint spectra but also with the same kernel (resp., image) as any given linear encoder
that has a good kernel (resp., image) spectrum.
