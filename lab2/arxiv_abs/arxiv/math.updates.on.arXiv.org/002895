Given $p$-dimensional Gaussian vectors $X_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \Sigma)$, $1 \leq i \leq
n$, where $p \geq n$, we are interested in testing a null hypothesis where $\Sigma = I_p$ against an
alternative hypothesis where all eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ are $1$, except for $r$ of them are larger
than $1$ (i.e., spiked eigenvalues). We consider a Rare/Weak setting where the spikes are sparse
(i.e., $1 \ll r \ll p$) and individually weak (i.e., each spiked eigenvalue is only slightly larger
than $1$), and discover a phase transition: the two-dimensional phase space that calibrates the
spike sparsity and strengths partitions into the Region of Impossibility and the Region of Possibility.
In Region of Impossibility, all tests are (asymptotically) powerless in separating the alternative
from the null. In Region of Possibility, there are tests that have (asymptotically) full power.
We consider a CuSum test, a trace-based test, an eigenvalue-based Higher Criticism test, and a Tracy-Widom
test (Johnstone 2001), and show that the first two tests have asymptotically full power in Region
of Possibility. To use our results from a different angle, we derive new bounds for (a) empirical
eigenvalues, and (b) cumulative sums of the empirical eigenvalues, both under the alternative
hypothesis. Part (a) is related to those in Baik, Ben-Arous and Peche (2005), but both the settings
and results are different. The study requires careful analysis of the $L^1$-distance of our testing
problem and delicate Radom Matrix Theory. Our technical devises include (a) a Gaussian proxy model,
(b) Le Cam's comparison of experiments, and (c) large deviation bounds on empirical eigenvalues.
