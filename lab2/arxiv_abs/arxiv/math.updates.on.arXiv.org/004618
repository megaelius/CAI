Let $\lambda$ be a partition with no more than $n$ parts. Let $\beta$ be a weakly increasing $n$-tuple
with entries from $\{ 1, ... , n \}$. The flagged Schur function in the variables $x_1, ... , x_n$ that
is indexed by $\lambda$ and $\beta$ has been defined to be the sum of the content weight monomials
for the semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$ whose values are row-wise bounded by the
entries of $\beta$. Gessel and Viennot gave a determinant expression for the flagged Schur function
indexed by $\lambda$ and $\beta$; this could be done since the pair $(\lambda, \beta)$ satisfied
their "nonpermutable" condition for the sequence of terminals of an $n$-tuple of lattice paths
that they used to model the tableaux. We generalize flagged Schur functions by dropping the requirement
that $\beta$ be weakly increasing. Then for each $\lambda$ we give a condition on the entries of $\beta$
for the pair $(\lambda, \beta)$ to be nonpermutable that is both necessary and sufficient. When
the parts of $\lambda$ are not distinct there will be multiple row bound $n$-tuples $\beta$ that
will produce the same set of tableaux. We accordingly group the bounding $\beta$ into equivalence
classes and identify the most efficient $\beta$ in each class for the determinant computation.
We recently showed that many other sets of objects that are indexed by $n$ and $\lambda$ are enumerated
by the number of these efficient $n$-tuples. We called these counts "parabolic Catalan numbers".
It is noted that the $GL(n)$ Demazure characters (key polynomials) indexed by 312-avoiding permutations
can also be expressed with these determinants.
