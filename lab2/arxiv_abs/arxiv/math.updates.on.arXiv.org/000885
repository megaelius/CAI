We consider the problem of estimating functionals of discrete distributions, and focus on tight
nonasymptotic analysis of the worst case squared error risk of widely used estimators. We apply
concentration inequalities to analyze the random fluctuation of these estimators around their
expectations, and the theory of approximation using positive linear operators to analyze the deviation
of their expectations from the true functional, namely their \emph{bias}. We characterize the
worst case squared error risk incurred by the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) in estimating
the Shannon entropy $H(P) = \sum_{i = 1}^S -p_i \ln p_i$, and $F_\alpha(P) = \sum_{i = 1}^S p_i^\alpha,\alpha>0$,
up to multiplicative constants, for any alphabet size $S\leq \infty$ and sample size $n$ for which
the risk may vanish. As a corollary, for Shannon entropy estimation, we show that it is necessary
and sufficient to have $n \gg S$ observations for the MLE to be consistent. In addition, we establish
that it is necessary and sufficient to consider $n \gg S^{1/\alpha}$ samples for the MLE to consistently
estimate $F_\alpha(P), 0<\alpha<1$. The minimax rate-optimal estimators for both problems require
$S/\ln S$ and $S^{1/\alpha}/\ln S$ samples, which implies that the MLE has a strictly sub-optimal
sample complexity. When $1<\alpha<3/2$, we show that the worst-case squared error rate of convergence
for the MLE is $n^{-2(\alpha-1)}$ for infinite alphabet size, while the minimax squared error rate
is $(n\ln n)^{-2(\alpha-1)}$. When $\alpha\geq 3/2$, the MLE achieves the minimax optimal rate
$n^{-1}$ regardless of the alphabet size. As an application of the general theory, we analyze the
Dirichlet prior smoothing techniques for Shannon entropy estimation. We show that no matter how
we tune the parameters in the Dirichlet prior, this technique cannot achieve the minimax rates in
entropy estimation.
