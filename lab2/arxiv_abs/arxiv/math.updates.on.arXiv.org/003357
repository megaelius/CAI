This paper presents an improved implicit sampling method for hierarchical Bayesian inverse problems.
A widely used approach for sampling posterior distribution is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). However, the samples generated by MCMC are usually strongly correlated. This may lead to
a small size of effective samples from a long Markov chain and the resultant posterior estimate may
be inaccurate. An implicit sampling method proposed in [11] can generate independent samples and
capture some inherent non-Gaussian features of the posterior based on the weights of samples. In
the implicit sampling method, the posterior samples are generated by constructing a map and distribute
around the MAP point. However, the weights of implicit sampling in previous works may cause excessive
concentration of samples and lead to ensemble collapse. To overcome this issue, we propose a new
weight formulation and make resampling based on the new weights. In practice, some parameters in
prior density are often unknown and a hierarchical Bayesian inference is necessary for posterior
exploration. To this end, the hierarchical Bayesian formulation is used to estimate the MAP point
and integrated in the implicit sampling framework. Compared to conventional implicit sampling,
the proposed implicit sampling method can significantly improve the posterior estimator and the
applicability for high dimensional inverse problems. The improved implicit sampling method is
applied to the Bayesian inverse problems of multi-term time fractional diffusion models in heterogeneous
media. To effectively capture the heterogeneity effect, we present a mixed generalized multiscale
finite element method (mixed GMsFEM) to solve the time fractional diffusion models in a coarse grid,
which can substantially speed up the Bayesian inversion.
