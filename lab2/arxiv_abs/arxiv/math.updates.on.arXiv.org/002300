Because of their capacity-approaching performance and their complexity/latency advantages,
spatially-coupled (SC) codes are among the most attractive error-correcting codes for use in modern
dense storage devices. SC codes are constructed by partitioning an underlying block code and coupling
the partitioned components. Here, we focus on circulant-based SC codes. Recently, the optimal
overlap (OO)-circulant power optimizer (CPO) approach was introduced to construct high performance
SC codes for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Flash channels. The OO stage operates on the
protograph of the SC code to derive the optimal partitioning that minimizes the number of detrimental
objects. Then, the CPO optimizes the circulant powers to further reduce this number. Since the nature
of detrimental objects in the graph of a code critically depends on the characteristics of the channel
of interest, extending the OO-CPO approach to construct SC codes for channels with intrinsic memory
is not a straightforward task. In this paper, we tackle one relevant extension; we construct high
performance SC codes for practical 1-D magnetic recording channels, i.e., partial-response (PR)
channels. Via combinatorial techniques, we carefully build and solve the optimization problem
of the OO partitioning, focusing on the objects of interest in the case of PR channels. Then, we customize
the CPO to further reduce the number of these objects in the graph of the code. SC codes designed using
the proposed OO-CPO approach for PR channels outperform prior state-of-the-art SC codes by around
3 orders of magnitude in frame error rate (FER) and 1.1 dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and more
intriguingly, outperform structured block codes of the same length by around 1.6 orders of magnitude
in FER and 0.4 dB in SNR.
