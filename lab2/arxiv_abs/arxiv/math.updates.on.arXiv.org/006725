We consider fine-grained probes of the entanglement structure of two dimensional conformal field
theories deformed by the irrelevant double-trace operator $T\bar{T}$ and its closely related
but nonetheless distinct single-trace counterpart. For holographic conformal field theories,
these deformations can be interpreted as modifications of bulk physics in the ultraviolet region
of anti-de Sitter space. Consequently, we can use the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and its generalizations
to mixed state entanglement measures to test highly nontrivial consistency conditions. In general,
the agreement between bulk and boundary quantities requires the equivalence of partition functions
on manifolds of arbitrary genus. For the single-trace deformation, which is dual to an asymptotically
linear dilaton geometry, we find that the mutual information and reflected entropy diverge for
disjoint intervals when the separation distance approaches a minimum, finite value that depends
solely on the deformation parameter. This implies that the mutual information fails to serve as
a geometric regulator which is related to the breakdown of the split property at the inverse Hagedorn
temperature. In contrast, for the double-trace deformation, which is dual to anti-de Sitter space
with a finite radial cutoff, we find all divergences to disappear including the standard quantum
field theory ultraviolet divergence that is generically seen as disjoint intervals become adjacent.
We furthermore compute reflected entropy in conformal perturbation theory. While we find formally
similar behavior between bulk and boundary computations, we find quantitatively distinct results.
We comment on the interpretation of these disagreements and the physics that must be altered to restore
consistency. We also briefly discuss the $T{\bar J}$ and $J{\bar T}$ deformations.
