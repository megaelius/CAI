This article investigates structural, geometrical, and topological characterizations and properties
of weakly modular graphs and of cell complexes derived from them. The unifying themes of our investigation
are various `nonpositive curvature' and `local-to-global' properties and characterizations
of weakly modular graphs and their subclasses. Weakly modular graphs have been introduced as a far-reaching
common generalization of median graphs (and more generally, of modular and orientable modular
graphs), Helly graphs, bridged graphs, and dual polar graphs occurring under different disguises
in several seemingly-unrelated fields of mathematics: Metric graph theory, Geometric group theory,
Incidence geometries and buildings, Theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization.
We give a local-to-global characterization of weakly modular graphs and their subclasses in terms
of simple connectedness of associated triangle-square complexes and specific local combinatorial
conditions. In particular, we revisit characterizations of dual polar graphs by Cameron and by
Brouwer-Cohen. We also show that (disk-)Helly graphs are precisely the clique-Helly graphs with
simply connected clique complexes. With $l_1$-embeddable weakly modular and sweakly modular
graphs we associate high-dimensional cell complexes, having several strong topological and geometrical
properties (contractibility and the CAT(0) property). Their cells have a specific structure:
they are basis polyhedra of even $\triangle$-matroids in the first case and orthoscheme complexes
of gated dual polar subgraphs in the second case. We resolve some open problems concerning subclasses
of weakly modular graphs: we prove a Brady-McCammond conjecture about CAT(0) metric on the orthoscheme
complexes of modular lattices; we answer Chastand's question about prime graphs for pre-median
graphs.
