We consider the primitive relay channel, where the source sends a message to the relay and to the destination,
and the relay helps the communication by transmitting an additional message to the destination
via a separate channel. Two well-known coding techniques have been introduced for this setting:
decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward. In decode-and-forward, the relay completely
decodes the message and sends some information to the destination; in compress-and-forward, the
relay does not decode, and it sends a compressed version of the received signal to the destination
using Wyner-Ziv coding. In this paper, we present a novel coding paradigm that provides an improved
achievable rate for the primitive relay channel. The idea is to combine compress-and-forward and
decode-and-forward via a chaining construction. We transmit over pairs of blocks: in the first
block, we use compress-and-forward; and in the second block, we use decode-and-forward. More specifically,
in the first block, the relay does not decode, it compresses the received signal via Wyner-Ziv, and
it sends only part of the compression to the destination. In the second block, the relay completely
decodes the message, it sends some information to the destination, and it also sends the remaining
part of the compression coming from the first block. By doing so, we are able to strictly outperform
both compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Note that the proposed coding scheme can be
implemented with polar codes. As such, it has the typical attractive properties of polar coding
schemes, namely, quasi-linear encoding and decoding complexity, and error probability that decays
at super-polynomial speed. As a running example, we take into account the special case of the erasure
relay channel, and we provide a comparison between the rates achievable by our proposed scheme and
the existing upper and lower bounds.
