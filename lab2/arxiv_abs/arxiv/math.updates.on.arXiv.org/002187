We present the results of the first application in the naval architecture field of a methodology
based on active subspaces properties for parameters space reduction. The physical problem considered
is the one of the simulation of the hydrodynamic flow past the hull of a ship advancing in calm water.
Such problem is extremely relevant at the preliminary stages of the ship design, when several flow
simulations are typically carried out by the engineers to assess the dependence of the hull total
resistance on the geometrical parameters of the hull, and others related with flows and hull properties.
Given the high number of geometric and physical parameters which might affect the total ship drag,
the main idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces properties to identify possible lower
dimensional structures in the parameter space. Thus, a fully automated procedure has been implemented
to produce several small shape perturbations of an original hull CAD geometry, in order to exploit
the resulting shapes to run high fidelity flow simulations with different structural and physical
parameters as well, and then collect data for the active subspaces analysis. The free form deformation
procedure used to morph the hull shapes, the high fidelity solver based on potential flow theory
with fully nonlinear free surface treatment, and the active subspaces analysis tool employed in
this work have all been developed and integrated within SISSA math- Lab as open source tools. The
contribution will also discuss several details of the implementation of such tools, as well as the
results of their application to the selected target engineering problem.
