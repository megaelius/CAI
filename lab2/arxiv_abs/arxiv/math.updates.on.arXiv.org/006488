We will show that there is a universal connection between the achievable closed-loop dynamics and
the corresponding feedback controller that produces it. This connection shows promise to lead
to new methods for robust nonlinear control in discrete-time. We will show that, given a causal nonlinear
discrete-time system and controller, the resulting closed-loop is a solution to a nonlinear operator
equation. Conversely, any causal solution to the nonlinear operator equation is a closed-loop
that can be achieved by some causal controller. Moreover, solutions can be substituted into a simple
dynamic controller structure, which we will refer to as a system level controller, to obtain an implementation
of the unique corresponding feedback controller. System level controllers could be an attractive
approach for robust nonlinear control, as we will show that even when they are parametrized with
approximate solutions to the operator equation, they can still produce robustly stable closed
loops. We will provide theoretical results that state how grade of approximation and robust stability
of the closed loop are related. Additionally, we will explore some first applications of our results.
Using the cart-pole system as an illustrative example, we will derive how to design robust discrete-time
trajectory tracking controllers for continuous-time nonlinear systems. Secondly, we will introduce
a particular class of system level controller that shows to be particularly useful for linear systems
with actuator saturation and state constraints. The special structure of the controller allows
for simple stability and performance analysis of the closed-loop in presence of disturbances.
A particular application to large-scale systems with actuator saturation and safety constraints
is presented in our companion paper.
