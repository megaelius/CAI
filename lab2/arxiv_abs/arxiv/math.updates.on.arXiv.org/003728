In \cite{Sde2018} we defined the notion of \textit{quantum double inclusion} associated to a finite-index
and finite-depth subfactor and studied the quantum double inclusion associated to the Kac algebra
subfactor $R^H \subset R$ where $H$ is a finite-dimensional Kac algebra acting outerly on the hyperfinite
$II_1$ factor $R$ and $R^H$ denotes the fixed-point subalgebra. In this article we analyse quantum
double inclusions associated to the family of Kac algebra subfactors given by $\{ R^H \subset R \rtimes
\underbrace{H \rtimes H^* \rtimes \cdots}_{{\text{$m$ times}}} : m \geq 1 \}$. For each $m > 2$,
we construct a model $\mathcal{N}^m \subset \mathcal{M}$ for the quantum double inclusion of $\{
R^H \subset R \rtimes \underbrace{H \rtimes H^* \rtimes \cdots}_{{\text{$m-2$ times}}} \}$ with
$\mathcal{N}^m = ((\cdots \rtimes H^{-2} \rtimes H^{-1}) \otimes (H^m \rtimes H^{m+1} \cdots))^{\prime
\prime}, \mathcal{M} = (\cdots \rtimes H^{-1} \rtimes H^0 \rtimes H^1 \rtimes \cdots)^{\prime
\prime}$ and where for any integer $i$, $H^i$ denotes $H$ or $H^*$ according as $i$ is odd or even.
In this article, we give an explicit description of $P^{\mathcal{N}^m \subset \mathcal{M}}$ ($m
> 2$), the subfactor planar algebra associated to $\mathcal{N}^m \subset \mathcal{M}$, which
turns out to be a planar subalgebra of $^{*(m)}\!P(H^m)$ (the adjoint of the $m$-cabling of the planar
algebra of $H^m$). We then show that for $m > 2$, depth of $\mathcal{N}^m \subset \mathcal{M}$ is
always two. Observing that $\mathcal{N}^m \subset \mathcal{M}$ is reducible for all $m > 2$, we
explicitly describe the weak Hopf $C^*$-algebra structure on $(\mathcal{N}^m)^{\prime} \cap
\mathcal{M}_2$, thus obtaining a family of weak Hopf $C^*$-algebras starting with a single Kac
algebra $H$.
