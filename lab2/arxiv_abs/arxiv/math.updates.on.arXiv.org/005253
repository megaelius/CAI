In this work we examine the problem of learning to cooperate in the context of wireless communication.
We consider the two agent setting where agents must learn modulation and demodulation schemes that
enable them to communicate with each other in the presence of a power-constrained additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. We investigate whether learning is possible under different levels
of information sharing between distributed agents that are not necessarily co-designed. We make
use of the "Echo" protocol, a learning protocol where an agent hears, understands, and repeats (echoes)
back the message received from another agent, simultaneously training itself to communicate.
To capture the idea of cooperation between agents that are "not necessarily co-designed," we use
two different populations of function approximators - neural networks and polynomials. In addition
to diverse learning agents, we include non-learning agents that use fixed modulation protocols
such as QPSK and 16QAM. We verify that the Echo learning approach succeeds independent of the inner
workings of the agents, and that learning agents can not only learn to match the communication expectations
of others, but can also collaboratively invent a successful communication approach from independent
random initializations. We complement our simulations with an implementation of the Echo protocol
in software-defined radios. To explore the continuum between tight co-design of learning agents
and independently designed agents, we study how learning is impacted by different levels of information
sharing - including sharing training symbols, sharing intermediate loss information, and sharing
full gradient information. We find that, in general, co-design (increased information sharing)
accelerates learning and that this effect becomes more pronounced as the communication task becomes
harder.
