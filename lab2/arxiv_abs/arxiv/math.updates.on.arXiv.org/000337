A commuting triple of operators $(A,B,P)$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is called a tetrablock
contraction if the closure of the set $$ E = \{\underline{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb{C}^3: 1-x_1z-x_2w+x_3zw
\neq 0 \text{ whenever }|z| < 1\text{ and }|w| < 1 \} $$ is a spectral set. In this paper, we have
constructed a functional model and produced a complete unitary invariant for a pure tetrablock
contraction. In this construction, the fundamental operators, which are the unique solutions
of the operator equations $$ A-B^*P = D_PX_1D_P \text{ and } B-A^*P=D_PX_2D_P, \text{ where $X_1,X_2
\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{D}_P)$}, $$ play a big role. \\ As a corollary to the functional model,
we show that every pure tetrablock isometry $(A,B,P)$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is unitarily
equivalent to $(M_{G_1^*+G_2z}, M_{G_2^*+G_1z},M_z)$ on $H^2(\mathcal{D}_{P^*})$, where
$G_1$ and $G_2$ are fundamental operators of $(A^*,B^*,P^*)$. \\ In \cite{sir and me}, a tetrablock
unitary dilation of a tetrablock contraction has been explicitly constructed with the assumptions
that the fundamental operators $F_1,F_2$ and $G_1,G_2$ of $(A,B,P)$ and $(A^*,B^*,P^*)$ respectively
satisfy $[X_1,X_2]=0$ and $[X_1,X_1^*]=[X_2X_2^*]$, in place of $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectively.
Here it is shown that the conditions can be relaxed. \\ We prove a Beurling-Lax-Halmos type theorem
for a triple of operators $(M_{F_1^*+F_2z},M_{F_2^*+F_1z},M_z)$, where $F_1,F_2 \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{E})$
are two operators and $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hilbert space. \\ We deal with a natural example of tetrablock
contraction on functions space to find out its fundamental operators.
