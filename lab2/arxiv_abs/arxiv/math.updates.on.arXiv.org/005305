Stochastic differential equations and the associated partial differential equations are the
cornerstone formalism in stochastic control problems. The universality of bilinear stochastic
systems can be found in autonomous systems, non-linear dynamic circuits, and mathematical finance.
Consensus on the Ito versus Stratonovich suggests stochastic systems embedded with Stratonovich
differential to describe the stochastic evolution of the state vector of real physical systems.
The mathematical theory of a scalar time-varying bilinear Stratonovich stochastic differential
equation is available in current texts. The theory of scalar Stratonovich systems was developed
by deriving their closed-form solutions and then conditional moments. Practical problems obeying
vector time-varying bilinear Stratonovich stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous.
However, their formal and systematic estimation theory is not available. In this paper, we develop
the results for non-homogeneous Markov processes obeying the vector Stratonovich bilinear stochastic
differential equation. Then, the theory of the paper is applied to a stochastic three-phase rectifier
circuit. The stochastic evolution of the rectifier state vector is constructed by utilizing the
Euler-Lagrange theory and embedding Stratonovich differential. Since the theory of the paper
accounts for the multidimensionality as well as respects Stratonovich stochasticity of the ubiquitous
bilinear system, the estimation Theorems will be remarkably useful to estimation and control of
nonlinear real physical systems. Finally, this paper will be of interest to control and computational
practitioners aspiring for the formal theory of bilinear stochastic systems arising from their
application as well as applied mathematicians looking for applications of formal bilinear stochastic
estimation theory.
