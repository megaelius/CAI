Motivated by the applications of the node-based shape optimization problem, where various response
evaluations are often considered in constrained optimization, we propose a central path following
method using the normalized gradients. There exist numerous methods solving constrained optimization
problems. The methods of the class active-set strategy try to travel along the active constraints
to solve constrained optimization problems. Contrary to the active-set methods, the algorithms
of the class interior-point method reach an optimal solution by traversing the interior of the feasible
domain. This characteristic is considered to be beneficial for shape optimization because the
usual zig-zagging behavior when traveling along the active constraints are avoided. However,
the interior-point methods require to solve a Newton problem in each iteration, which is generally
considered to be difficult for the shape optimization problem. In the present work, we propose a
path following method based on the gradient flow calculated using the normalized gradients of the
objective and constraint functions. Applying the proposed method, we observe that the centrality
conditions for the interior-point method are approached iteratively. The algorithm is able to
approach a local minimum by traversing the interior of the feasible domain by only using the gradient
information of the objective and constraint functions. We show a convergence analysis for a 2D optimization
problem with a linear constraint. The results are shown first with analytical 2D constrained optimization
problems, and then the results of shape optimization problems with a large number of design variables
are discussed. To robustly deal with complex geometries, the Vertex Morphing method is used.
