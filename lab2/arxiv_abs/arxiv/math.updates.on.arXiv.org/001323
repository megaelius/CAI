Let $X$ be an algebraic variety with quotient field $K(X)$. Let $s$ be the highest multiplicity of
$X$ and $F_s(X)$ the set of points of multiplicity $s$. A sequence of blow ups at regular centers $Y_i
\subset F_s(X_i)$, $X \leftarrow X_1 \leftarrow \dotsb \leftarrow X_n$, is a reduction of the multiplicity
if $F_s(X_n) $ is empty. In characteristic zero there is an algorithm which assigns to each $X$ a unique
reduction of the multiplicity. Fix $K(X) \subset L$ a finite extension of fields of degree $r$. For
a finite map $\beta : X' \to X$ with $K(X') = L$ the highest multiplicity of $X'$ is at most $r \cdot s$.
When the bound is achieved we say that $\beta$ is transversal. We will see that, if $\beta$ is transversal,
then $F_{rs}(X')$ is homeomorphic to its image and $\beta(F_{rs}(X'))\subset F_{s}(X)$. We will
see that a blow up $X' \leftarrow X'_1$ along a regular center $Y'_1 \subset F_{rs}(X'_1)$ induces
a blow up $X \leftarrow X_1$ along a center $Y_1 \subset F_s(X_1)$ and a finite morphism $\beta_1
: X'_1 \to X_1$. In particular, if $F_{rs}(X'_1) \neq \emptyset$ then $\beta_1$ is transversal.
We say that $\beta : X' \to X$ is strongly transversal if $\beta(F_{rs}(X')) = F_s(X)$ and the equality
is preserved for any sequence of blow ups at regular equimultiple centers. In such case, a reduction
of the multiplicity of $X'$ induces a reduction of the multiplicity of $X$ and vice versa. We will
show that given $X$ and a finite extension $L$ of $K(X)$ one can construct a strongly transversal
morphism $\beta: X'\to X$ with $K(X')=L$. In characteristic zero we show that the algorithmic reduction
of the multiplicity of $X$ and that of $X'$ are naturally compatible when $\beta : X' \to X$ is strongly
transversal, i.e., $X'$ and $X$ admit a simultaneous reduction of the multiplicity.
