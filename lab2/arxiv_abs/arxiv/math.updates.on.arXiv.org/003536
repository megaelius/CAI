As a counterpoint to classical stochastic particle methods for diffusion, we develop a deterministic
particle method for linear and nonlinear diffusion. At first glance, deterministic particle methods
are incompatible with diffusive partial differential equations since initial data given by sums
of Dirac masses would be smoothed instantaneously: particles do not remain particles. Inspired
by classical vortex blob methods, we introduce a nonlocal regularization of our velocity field
that ensures particles do remain particles, and we apply this to develop a numerical blob method
for a range of diffusive partial differential equations of Wasserstein gradient flow type, including
the heat equation, the porous medium equation, the Fokker-Planck equation, the Keller-Segel equation,
and its variants. Our choice of regularization is guided by the Wasserstein gradient flow structure,
and the corresponding energy has a novel form, combining aspects of the well-known interaction
and potential energies. In the presence of a confining drift or interaction potential, we prove
that minimizers of the regularized energy exist and, as the regularization is removed, converge
to the minimizers of the unregularized energy. We then restrict our attention to nonlinear diffusion
of porous medium type with at least quadratic exponent. Under sufficient regularity assumptions,
we prove that gradient flows of the regularized energies converge to solutions of the porous medium
equation. As a corollary, we obtain convergence of our numerical blob method, again under sufficient
regularity assumptions. We conclude by considering a range of numerical examples to demonstrate
our method's rate of convergence to exact solutions and to illustrate key qualitative properties
preserved by the method, including asymptotic behavior of the Fokker-Planck equation and critical
mass of the two-dimensional Keller-Segel equation.
