In this paper we consider the clustering coefficient and clustering function in a random graph model
proposed by Krioukov et al.~in 2010. In this model, nodes are chosen randomly inside a disk in the
hyperbolic plane and two nodes are connected if they are at most a certain hyperbolic distance from
each other. It has been shown that this model has various properties associated with complex networks,
e.g. power-law degree distribution, short distances and non-vanishing clustering coefficient.
Here we show that the clustering coefficient tends in probability to a constant $\gamma$ that we
give explicitly as a closed form expression in terms of $\alpha, \nu$ and certain special functions.
This improves earlier work by Gugelmann et al., who proved that the clustering coefficient remains
bounded away from zero with high probability, but left open the issue of convergence to a limiting
constant. Similarly, we are able to show that $c(k)$, the average clustering coefficient over all
vertices of degree exactly $k$, tends in probability to a limit $\gamma(k)$ which we give explicitly
as a closed form expression in terms of $\alpha, \nu$ and certain special functions. We are able to
extend this last result also to sequences $(k_n)_n$ where $k_n$ grows as a function of $n$. Our results
show that $\gamma(k)$ scales differently, as $k$ grows, for different ranges of $\alpha$. More
precisely, there exists constants $c_{\alpha,\nu}$ depending on $\alpha$ and $\nu$, such that
as $k \to \infty$, $\gamma(k) \sim c_{\alpha,\nu} \cdot k^{2 - 4\alpha}$ if $\frac{1}{2} < \alpha
< \frac{3}{4}$, $\gamma(k) \sim c_{\alpha,\nu} \cdot \log(k) \cdot k^{-1} $ if $\alpha=\frac{3}{4}$
and $\gamma(k) \sim c_{\alpha,\nu} \cdot k^{-1}$ when $\alpha > \frac{3}{4}$. These results contradict
a claim of Krioukov et al., which stated that the limiting values $\gamma(k)$ should always scale
with $k^{-1}$ as we let $k$ grow.
