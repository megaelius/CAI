We analyse signed networks from the perspective of balance theory which predicts structural balance
as a global structure for signed social networks that represent groups of friends and enemies. The
scarcity of balanced networks encouraged us to define the notion of partial balance in order to quantify
the extent to which a network is balanced. We evaluate several numerical measures of partial balance
and recommend using the frustration index, a measure that satisfies key axiomatic properties and
allows us to analyse graphs based on their levels of partial balance. The exact algorithms used in
the literature to compute the frustration index, also called the line index of balance, are not scalable
and cannot process graphs with a few hundred edges. We formulate computing the frustration index
as a graph optimisation problem to find the minimum number of edges whose removal results in a balanced
network given binary decision variables associated with graph nodes and edges. We use our first
optimisation model to analyse graphs with up to 3000 edges. Reformulating the optimisation problem,
we develop three more efficient binary linear programming models. Equipping the models with valid
inequalities and prioritised branching as speed-up techniques allows us to process graphs with
15000 edges on inexpensive hardware. Besides making exact computations possible for large graphs,
we show that our models outperform heuristics and approximation algorithms suggested in the literature
by orders of magnitude. We extend the concepts of balance and frustration in signed networks to applications
beyond the classic friend-enemy interpretation of balance theory in social context. Using a high-performance
computer, we analyse graphs with up to 100000 edges to investigate a range of applications from biology
and chemistry to finance, international relations, and physics.
