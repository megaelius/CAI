In this work, linearized multivariate skew polynomials with coefficients over division rings
are introduced, which generalize univariate linearized polynomials. It is shown that they are
right linear over a division subring called centralizer, and their evaluation is connected to the
arithmetic evaluation of free multivariate skew polynomials. It is shown that P-independence
corresponds to right linear independence over centralizers of pair-wise disjoint conjugacy classes.
Hence it is deduced that finitely generated P-closed sets correspond to lists of finite-dimensional
right vector spaces according to the partition of the P-closed set into conjugacy classes. Similarly,
it is shown that products of free multivariate skew polynomials translate into coordinate-wise
compositions of linearized multivariate skew polynomials, and compositions over a single conjugacy
class translates into matrix products over the corresponding centralizers. Several applications
of these results are given. First, linearized multivariate Vandermonde matrices are introduced,
which extend multivariate Moore and Wronskian matrices. The previous results give an explicit
method to determine their ranks in general. Such matrices also give rise to skew and linearized Reed-Muller
codes, which are introduced and connected in this work. Finally, we introduce P-Galois extensions
of division rings by considering the subring to be a centralizer corresponding to a conjugacy class
given by a multivariate skew polynomial ring. Such extensions generalize (finite) Galois extension
of fields. Three Galois-theoretic results are extended to such extensions: Artin's theorem on
the dimension of the larger division ring over its subring, the Galois correspondence, and Hilbert's
Theorem 90.
