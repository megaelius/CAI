In an on-line secret sharing scheme the dealer assigns shares in the order the participants show
up, knowing only those qualified subsets whose all members she has seen. We assume that the overall
access structure is known and only the order of the participants is unknown. On-line secret sharing
is a useful primitive when the set of participants grows in time, and redistributing the secret is
too expensive. In this paper we start the investigation of unconditionally secure on-line secret
sharing schemes. The complexity of a secret sharing scheme is the size of the largest share a single
participant can receive over the size of the secret. The infimum of this amount in the on-line or off-line
setting is the on-line or off-line complexity of the access structure, respectively. For paths
on at most five vertices and cycles on at most six vertices the on-line and offline complexities are
equal, while for other paths and cycles these values differ. We show that the gap between these values
can be arbitrarily large even for graph based access structures. We present a general on-line secret
sharing scheme that we call first-fit. Its complexity is the maximal degree of the access structure.
We show, however, that this on-line scheme is never optimal: the on-line complexity is always strictly
less than the maximal degree. On the other hand, we give examples where the first-fit scheme is almost
optimal, namely, the on-line complexity can be arbitrarily close to the maximal degree. The performance
ratio is the ratio of the on-line and off-line complexities of the same access structure. We show
that for graphs the performance ratio is smaller than the number of vertices, and for an infinite
family of graphs the performance ratio is at least constant times the square root of the number of
vertices.
