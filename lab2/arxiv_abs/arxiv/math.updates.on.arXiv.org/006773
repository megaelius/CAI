An important concept in Physics is the notion of an isolated system. It is used in many different areas
to describe the properties of a physical system which has been isolated from its environment. The
interaction with the 'outside' is then usually reduced to a scattering process, in which incoming
radiation interacts with the system, which in turn emits outgoing radiation. In Einstein's theory
of gravitation isolated systems are modeled as asymptotically flat space-times. They provide
the appropriate paradigm for the study of gravitational waves and their interaction with a material
system or even only with themselves. In view of the emerging era of gravitational wave astronomy,
in which gravitational wave signals from many different astrophysical sources are detected and
interpreted, it is necessary to have a foundation for the theoretical and numerical treatments
of these signals. Furthermore, from a purely mathematical point of view, it is important to have
a full understanding of the implications of imposing the condition of asymptotic flatness onto
solutions of the Einstein equations. While it is known that there exists a large class of asymptotically
flat solutions of Einstein's equations, it is not known what the necessary and sufficient conditions
at infinity are that have to be imposed on initial data so that they evolve into regular asymptotically
flat space-times. The crux lies in the region near space-like infinity $i^0$ where incoming and
outgoing radiation 'meet'. In this paper we review the current knowledge and some of the analytical
and numerical work that has gone into the attempt to understand the structure of asymptotically
flat space-times near space-like and null-infinity.
