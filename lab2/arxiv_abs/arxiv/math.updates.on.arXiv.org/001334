It is pointed out that the generalized Lambert series $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{N-2h}}{e^{n^{N}x}-1}$
studied by Kanemitsu, Tanigawa and Yoshimoto can be found on page $332$ of Ramanujan's Lost Notebook
in a slightly more general form. Kanemitsu, Tanigawa and Yoshimoto obtained an important transformation
of this series for the parameters $N$ and $h$ satisfying $0<h\leq N/2, N\in\mathbb{N}$, and later,
a transformation for $N$ even and $h\geq N/2$. Here we extend their results for any positive integer
$N$ and any integer $h$ such that $h\leq 0$ or $h>N/2$. Their results and our extension of them together
give, as a special case, a new generalization of Ramanujan's famous formula for odd zeta values.
For any odd positive integer $N$ and any non-zero integer $m$, this generalization is a relation
between $\zeta(2m+1)$ and $\zeta(2Nm+1)$ by way of $N+1$ generalized Lambert series. For example,
it gives a relation between $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(7)$. We also obtain a result complementary to
the aforementioned generalization for any even positive integer $N$ and any integer $m$, which
generalizes a transformation of Wigert and which can be regarded as a formula for $\zeta\left(2m+1-\frac{1}{N}\right)$.
Several important corollaries of these generalizations, which include, as special cases, some
well-known results in the literature, are obtained along with the Zudilin-type and Rivoal-type
results on transcendence of certain values, and, in particular, a transcendence criterion for
Euler's constant $\gamma$. We also point out an error in a result of Chandrasekharan and Narasimhan,
which when corrected, results in nothing but Ramanujan's formula for $\zeta(2m+1)$ for $m>0$.
