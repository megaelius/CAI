Potential algebras feature in the minimal model program and noncommutative resolution of singularities,
and the important cases are when they are finite dimensional, or of linear growth. We develop techniques,
involving Gr\"obner basis theory and generalized Golod-Shafarevich type theorems for potential
algebras, to determine finiteness conditions in terms of the potential. We consider two-generated
potential algebras. Using Gr\"obner bases techniques and arguing in terms of associated truncated
algebra we prove that they cannot have dimension smaller than $8$. This answers a question of Wemyss
\cite{Wemyss}, related to the geometric argument of Toda \cite{T}. We derive from the improved
version of the Golod-Shafarevich theorem, that if the potential has only terms of degree 5 or higher,
then the potential algebra is infinite dimensional. We prove, that potential algebra for any homogeneous
potential of degree $n\geq 3$ is infinite dimensional. The proof includes a complete classification
of all potentials of degree 3. Then we introduce a certain version of Koszul complex, and prove that
in the class ${\cal P}_n$ of potential algebras with homogeneous potential of degree $n+1\geq 4$,
the minimal Hilbert series is $H_n=\frac{1}{1-2t+2t^n-t^{n+1}}$, so they are all infinite dimensional.
Moreover, growth could be polynomial (but non-linear) for the potential of degree 4, and is always
exponential for potential of degree starting from 5. For one particular type of potential we prove
a conjecture by Wemyss, which relates the difference of dimensions of potential algebra and its
abelianization with Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.
