Reconstructing continuous signals from a small number of discrete samples is a fundamental problem
across science and engineering. In practice, we are often interested in signals with 'simple' Fourier
structure, such as bandlimited, multiband, and Fourier sparse signals. More broadly, any prior
knowledge about a signal's Fourier power spectrum can constrain its complexity. Intuitively,
signals with more highly constrained Fourier structure require fewer samples to reconstruct.
We formalize this intuition by showing that, roughly, a continuous signal from a given class can
be approximately reconstructed using a number of samples proportional to the *statistical dimension*
of the allowed power spectrum of that class. Further, in nearly all settings, this natural measure
tightly characterizes the sample complexity of signal reconstruction. Surprisingly, we also
show that, up to logarithmic factors, a universal non-uniform sampling strategy can achieve this
optimal complexity for *any class of signals*. We present a simple and efficient algorithm for recovering
a signal from the samples taken. For bandlimited and sparse signals, our method matches the state-of-the-art.
At the same time, it gives the first computationally and sample efficient solution to a broad range
of problems, including multiband signal reconstruction and kriging and Gaussian process regression
tasks in one dimension. Our work is based on a novel connection between randomized linear algebra
and signal reconstruction with constrained Fourier structure. We extend tools based on statistical
leverage score sampling and column-based matrix reconstruction to the approximation of continuous
linear operators that arise in signal reconstruction. We believe that these extensions are of independent
interest and serve as a foundation for tackling a broad range of continuous time problems using randomized
methods.
