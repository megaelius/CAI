Wireless nodes in future communication systems need to overcome three barriers when compared to
their transitional counterparts, namely to support significantly higher data rates, have long-lasting
energy supplies and remain fully operational in interference-limited heterogeneous networks.
This could be partially achieved by providing three promising features, which are radio frequency
(RF) energy harvesting, improper Gaussian signaling and operating in full-duplex communication
mode, i.e., transmit and receive at the same time within the same frequency band. In this paper, we
consider these aspects jointly in a multi-antenna heterogeneous two-tier network. In this network,
the users in the femto- cell are sharing the scarce resources with the cellular users in the macro-cell
and have to cope with the interference from the macro-cell base station as well as the transmitter
noise and residual self- interference (RSI) due to imperfect full-duplex operation. Interestingly
enough, while these impairments are detrimental from the achievable rate perspective, they are
beneficial from the energy harvesting aspect as they carry RF energy. In this paper, we consider
this natural trade-off jointly and propose appropriate optimization problems for beamforming
and optimal resource allocation. Moreover, various receiver structures are employed for both
information detection (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) capabilities. The paper aims at characterizing
the trade-off between the achievable rates and harvested energies. Rate and energy maximization
problems are thoroughly investigated. Finally, the numerical illustrations demonstrate the
impact of energy harvesting on the achievable rate performance.
