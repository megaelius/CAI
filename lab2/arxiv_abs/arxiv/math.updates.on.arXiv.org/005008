Amalgamation in the totally non-negative part of positroid varieties is equivalent to gluing copies
of $Gr^{TP}(1,3)$ and $Gr^{TP}(2,3)$. Lam has proposed to represent amalgamation in positroid
varieties by equivalence classes of relations on bipartite graphs and identify total non-negativity
via edge signatures. Here we provide a complete and explicit characterization of such signatures
on the planar bicolored trivalent directed perfect (PBTDP) networks in the disk parametrizing
positroid cells $S_M^{TNN}$.To a PBTDP graph $G$ representing $S_M^{TNN}$, , we associate a geometric
signature satisfying full rank condition and total non--negativity. Such signature is uniquely
identified by geometric indices ruled by orientation and gauge ray direction. All geometric signatures
are equivalent up to a gauge transformation and complete. A system of relations on $G$ has full rank
and its image is totally non-negative for any choice of positive weights if only if its signature
is geometric; in such case, the image is $S_M^{TNN}$. We give a combinatorial representation of
geometric signatures on reduced graphs. We solve the system of geometric relations. The edge vector
components are rational in the weights with subtraction--free denominators, and have explicit
expressions in terms of conservative and edge flows. At boundary sources they give the boundary
measurement matrix. If $G$ is acyclically orientable, all components are subtraction-free rational
in the weights w.r.t. a convenient basis. We provide explicit formulas for the transformation rules
w.r.t. changes the orientation, the several gauges of the given network, moves and reductions of
networks. We express gauge freedoms and changes of orientation as equivalence transformations
of the geometric signature.
