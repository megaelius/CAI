Many important stable matching problems are known to be NP-hard, even when strong restrictions
are placed on the input. In this paper we seek to identify structural properties of instances of stable
matching problems which will allow us to design efficient algorithms using elementary techniques.
We focus on the setting in which all agents involved in some matching problem can be partitioned into
k different types, where the type of an agent determines his or her preferences, and agents have preferences
over types (which may be refined by more detailed preferences within a single type). This situation
would arise in practice if agents form preferences solely based on some small collection of agents'
attributes. We also consider a generalisation in which each agent may consider some small collection
of other agents to be exceptional, and rank these in a way that is not consistent with their types;
this could happen in practice if agents have prior contact with a small number of candidates. We show
that (for the case without exceptions), several well-studied NP-hard stable matching problems
including Max SMTI (that of finding the maximum cardinality stable matching in an instance of stable
marriage with ties and incomplete lists) belong to the parameterised complexity class FPT when
parameterised by the number of different types of agents needed to describe the instance. For Max
SMTI this tractability result can be extended to the setting in which each agent promotes at most
one `exceptional' candidate to the top of his/her list (when preferences within types are not refined),
but the problem remains NP-hard if preference lists can contain two or more exceptions and the exceptional
candidates can be placed anywhere in the preference lists, even if the number of types is bounded
by a constant.
