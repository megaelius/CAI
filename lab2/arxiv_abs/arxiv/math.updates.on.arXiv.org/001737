The power spectral density (PSD) of any time-dependent stochastic processes $X_t$ is a meaningful
feature of its spectral content. In its text-book definition, the PSD is the Fourier transform of
the covariance function of $X_t$ over an infinitely large observation time $T$, that is, it is defined
as an ensemble-averaged property taken in the limit $T \to \infty$. A legitimate question is what
information on the PSD can be reliably obtained from single-trajectory experiments, if one goes
beyond the standard definition and analyzes the PSD of a \textit{single} trajectory recorded for
a \textit{finite} observation time $T$. In quest for this answer, for a $d$-dimensional Brownian
motion we calculate the probability density function of a single-trajectory PSD for arbitrary
frequency $f$, finite observation time $T$ and arbitrary number $k$ of projections of the trajectory
on different axes. We show analytically that the scaling exponent for the frequency-dependence
of the PSD specific to an ensemble of Brownian motion trajectories can be already obtained from a
single trajectory, while the numerical amplitude in the relation between the ensemble-averaged
and single-trajectory PSDs is a fluctuating property which varies from realization to realization.
The distribution of this amplitude is calculated exactly and is discussed in detail. Our results
are confirmed by numerical simulations and single particle tracking experiments, with remarkably
good agreement. In addition we consider a truncated Wiener representation of Brownian motion,
and the case of a discrete-time lattice random walk. We highlight some differences in the behavior
of a single-trajectory PSD for Brownian motion and for the two latter situations. The framework
developed herein will allow for meaningful physical analysis of experimental stochastic trajectories.
