In [Chatterjee and Dembo '14], the authors define a notion of complexity of a measure on the boolean
cube in terms of covering numbers of the gradient of its log-density. Using this notion, they derive
a framework for computing large deviations of nonlinear functions of independent Bernoulli random
variables. In this work we introduce a new notion of complexity, namely the Gaussian-width of the
gradient of the log-density (which, by standard tools, is controlled by respective covering numbers).
We prove structure theorems for measures of low complexity on the discrete cube and on Gaussian space.
On the cube $\{-1,1\}^n$, we show that a measure $\nu$ which exhibits low complexity can be written
as a mixture of measures $\{\nu_\theta\}_{\theta \in \mathcal{I}}$ such that: i. for each $\theta$,
the measure $\nu_\theta$ is a small perturbation of $\nu$ such that $\log \tfrac{d \nu_\theta}{d
\nu}$ is a linear function whose gradient is small and, ii. $\nu_\theta$ is close to some product
measure, in Wasserstein distance, for most $\theta$. Thus, our framework can be used to study the
behavior of low-complexity measures beyond approximation of the partition function, showing
that those measures are roughly mixtures of product measures whose entropy is close to that of the
original measure. As a corollary, we derive a mean-field approximation of the log-partition function
which improves the main theorem of Chatterjee and Dembo in several ways: 1. It does not require any
bounds on second derivatives. 2. The covering number is replaced by the weaker notion of Gaussian-width
3. We obtain stronger asymptotics with respect to the dimension. A second corollary is a decomposition
theorem for exponential random graphs. In the Gaussian case, we show that measures of low-complexity
exhibit an almost-tight reverse Log-Sobolev inequality.
