In a pedagogical but exhaustive manner, this survey reviews the main results on input-to-state
stability (ISS) for infinite-dimensional systems. This property allows estimating the impact
of inputs and initial conditions on both the intermediate values and the asymptotic bound on the
solutions. ISS has unified the input-output and Lyapunov stability theories and is a crucial property
in stability theory of control systems as well as for many applications whose dynamics depend on
parameters, unknown perturbations, or other inputs. Starting from classic results for nonlinear
ordinary differential equations, we motivate the study of ISS property for distributed parameter
systems. Then fundamental properties are given, as an ISS superposition theorem and characterizations
of (global and local) ISS in terms of Lyapunov functions. We explain in detail the functional-analytic
approach to ISS theory of linear systems with unbounded input operators, with a special attention
devoted to ISS theory of boundary control systems. Lyapunov method is shown to be very useful for
both linear and nonlinear models, including parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations.
Next, we show the efficiency of ISS framework to study stability of large-scale networks, coupled
either via the boundary or via the interior of the spatial domain. ISS methodology allows reducing
the stability analysis of complex networks, by considering the stability properties of its components
and the interconnection structure between the subsystems. An extra section is devoted to ISS theory
of time-delay systems with the emphasis on techniques, which are particularly suited for this class
of systems. Finally, numerous applications are considered in this survey, where ISS properties
play a crucial role in their study. Furthermore, this survey suggests many open problems throughout
the paper.
