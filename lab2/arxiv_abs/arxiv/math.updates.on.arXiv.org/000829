Two main gauge invariant off-shell models are studied in this Thesis. I) Poincare-invariant topological
gravity in even dimensions is formulated as a transgression field theory whose gauge connections
are associated to linear and nonlinear realizations of the Poincare group ISO(d-1,1). The resulting
theory is a gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model whereby the transition functions relating gauge fields
belong to the coset ISO(d-1,1)/SO(d-1,1). The supersymmetric extension leads to topological
supergravity in two dimensions starting from a transgression field theory for the super-Poincare
group in three dimensions. The construction is extended to a three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory
of gravity invariant under the Maxwell algebra, where the corresponding Maxwell gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten
model is obtained. II) dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons theories with arbitrary gauge group
in a formalism based on equivariant principal bundles is considered. For the classical gauge groups
the relations between equivariant principal bundles and quiver bundles is clarified, and show
that the reduced quiver gauge theories are all generically built on the same universal symmetry
breaking pattern. The reduced model is a novel Chern-Simons-Higgs theory consisting of a Chern-Simons
term valued in the residual gauge group plus a higher order gauge and diffeomorphism invariant coupling
of Higgs fields with the gauge fields. The moduli spaces of solutions provide in some instances geometric
representations of certain quiver varieties as moduli spaces of flat invariant connections. In
the context of dimensional reductions involving non-compact gauge groups, the reduction of five-dimensional
supergravity induce novel couplings between gravity and matter. The resulting model is regarded
as to a quiver gauge theory of AdS(3)xU(1) gravity involving a non-minimal coupling to scalar Higgs
fermion fields.
