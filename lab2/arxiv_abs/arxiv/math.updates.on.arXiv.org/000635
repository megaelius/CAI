The integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources requires increased
flexibility in the operation of the electric grid. Storage, broadly speaking, provides the flexibility
of shifting energy over time; network, on the other hand, provides the flexibility of shifting energy
over geographical locations. The optimal control of storage networks in stochastic environments
is an important open problem. The key challenge is that, even in small networks, the corresponding
constrained stochastic control problems on continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality,
and are intractable in general settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is known to
give optimal or provably near-optimal performance for this problem. This paper provides an efficient
algorithm to solve this problem with performance guarantees. We study the operation of storage
networks, \ie, a storage system interconnected via a power network. An online algorithm, termed
Online Modified Greedy algorithm, is developed for the corresponding constrained stochastic
control problem. A suboptimality bound for the algorithm is derived, and a semidefinite program
is constructed to minimize the bound. In many cases, the bound approaches zero so that the algorithm
is near-optimal. A task-based distributed implementation of the online algorithm relying only
on local information and neighbor communication is then developed based on the alternating direction
method of multipliers. Numerical examples verify the established theoretical performance bounds,
and indicates the scalability of the algorithm. %This paper concerns about the problem of operating
a storage system interconnected via a power network under various sources of uncertainties. This
problem is of critical importance in view of the international trend of renewable integration.
