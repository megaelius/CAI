The problem involving the extension of functions from a certain class and defined on subdomains
of the ambient space to the whole space is an old and a well investigated theme in analysis. A related
question whether the extensions that result in the process may be chosen in a linear or a continuous
manner between appropriate spaces of functions turns out to be highly nontrivial. That this holds
for the class of continuous functions defined on metric spaces is the well-known Borsuk-Dugundji
theorem which asserts that given a metric space M and a subspace S of M, each continuous function g
on S can be extended to a continuous function f on X such that the resulting assignment from C(S) to
C(M) is a norm-one continuous linear extension operator. The present paper is devoted to an investigation
of this problem in the context of extendability of Lipschitz functions from closed subspaces of
a given Banach space to the whole space such that the choice of the extended function gives rise to
a bounded linear (extension) operator between appropriate spaces of Lipschitz functions. It is
shown that the indicated property holds precisely when the underlying space is isomorphic to a Hilbert
space. Among certain useful consequences of this theorem, we provide an isomorphic analogue of
a well-known theorem of S. Reich by show ing that closed convex subsets of a Banach space X arise as
Lipschitz retracts of X precisely when X is isomorphically a Hilbert space. We shall also discuss
the issue of bounded linear extension operators between spaces of Lipschitz functions now defined
on arbitrary subsets of Banach spaces and provide a direct proof of the known non-existence of such
an extension operator by using methods which are more accessible than those initially employed
by the authors.
