Millimeter wave (mmWave) band, or high frequencies such as THz, has large undeveloped band of spectrum.
However, wireless channels over the mmWave band usually have one or two paths only due to the severe
attenuation. The channel property restricts its development in the multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system, which can improve throughput by increasing the spectral efficiency. Recent development
in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides new opportunities to mmWave communications.
In this study, we propose a mmWave system, which used low-precision analog-to-digital converters
(ADCs), with the aid of several RIS arrays. Moreover, each RIS array has many reflectors with discrete
phase shift. By employing the linear spatial processing, these arrays form a synthetic channel
with increased spatial diversity and power gain, which can support MIMO transmission. We develop
a MIMO detector according to the characteristics of the synthetic channel. RIS arrays can provide
spatial diversity to support MIMO transmission, however, different number, antenna configuration,
and deployment of RIS arrays affect the bit error rate (BER) performance. We present state evolution
(SE) equations to evaluate the BER of the proposed MIMO detector in the different cases. The BER performance
of indoor system is studied extensively through leveraging by the SE equations. We reveal numerous
insights about the RIS effects and discuss the appropriate system settings. In addition, our results
demonstrate that the low-cost hardware, such as the 3-bit ADCs of the receiver side and the 2-bit
uniform discrete phase shift of the RIS arrays, only moderately degenerate the system performance.
