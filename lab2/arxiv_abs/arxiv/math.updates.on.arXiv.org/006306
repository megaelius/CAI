We consider the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation with a Burgers-type convective term that is used as
a model of coarsening dynamics in laterally driven phase-separating systems. In the absence of
driving, it is known that solutions to the standard CH equation are characterized by an initial stage
of phase separation into regions of one phase surrounded by the other phase (i.e., clusters or drops/holes
or islands are obtained) followed by the coarsening process, where the average size of the structures
grows in time and their number decreases. Moreover, two main coarsening modes have been identified
in the literature, namely, coarsening due to volume transfer and due to translation. In the opposite
limit of strong driving, the well-known Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation is recovered, which
may produce complicated chaotic spatio-temporal oscillations. The primary aim of the present
work is to perform a detailed and systematic investigation of the transitions in the solutions of
the convective CH (cCH) equation for a wide range of parameter values, and, in particular, to understand
in detail how the coarsening dynamics is affected by an increase of the strength of the lateral driving
force. Considering symmetric two-drop states, we find that one of the coarsening modes is stabilized
at relatively weak driving, and the type of the remaining mode may change as driving increases. Furthermore,
there exist intervals in the driving strength where coarsening is completely stabilized. In the
intervals where the symmetric two-drop states are unstable they can evolve, for example, into one-drop
states, two-drop states of broken symmetry or even time-periodic two-drop states that consist
of two traveling drops that periodically exchange mass. We present detailed stability diagrams
for symmetric two-drop states in various parameter planes and corroborate our findings by selected
time simulations.
