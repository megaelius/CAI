This paper develops an analytic framework to design both stress-controlled and displacement-controlled
T-periodic loadings which make the quasistatic evolution of a one-dimensional network of elastoplastic
springs converging to a unique periodic regime. The solution of such an evolution problem is a function
t-> (e(t),p(t)), where e_i(t) and p_i(t) are the elastic and plastic deformations of spring i, defined
on [t0,\infty) by the initial condition (e(t0),p(t0)). After we rigorously convert the problem
into a Moreau sweeping process with a moving polyhedron C(t) in a vector space E of dimension d, it
becomes natural to expect (based on a result by Krejci) that the solution t->(e(t),p(t)) always
converges to a T-periodic function. The achievement of this paper is in spotting a class of loadings
where the Krejci's limit doesn't depend on the initial condition (e(t0),p(t0)) and so all the trajectories
approach the same T-periodic regime. The proposed class of sweeping processes is the one for which
the normal vectors of any d different facets of the moving polyhedron C(t) are linearly independent.
We further link this geometric condition to mechanical properties of the given network of springs.
We discover that the normal vectors of any d different facets of the moving polyhedron C(t) are linearly
independent, if the number of displacement-controlled loadings is two less the number of nodes
of the given network of springs and when the magnitude of the stress-controlled loading is sufficiently
large (but admissible). The result can be viewed as an analogue of the high-gain control method for
elastoplastic systems. In continuum theory of plasticity, the respective result is known as Frederick-Armstrong
theorem.
