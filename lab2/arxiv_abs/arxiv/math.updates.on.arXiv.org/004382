Scattering problems in periodic waveguides are interesting but challenging topics in mathematics,
both theoretically and numerically. Due to the existence of eigenvalue, the unique solvability
of such problems is not always guaranteed. To obtain a unique solution that is physically meaningful,
the limiting absorption principle (LAP) is a commenly used method. LAP assumes that the limit of
a family of solutions of scattering problems with absorbing material converges, as the absorbing
parameter tends to $0$, and the limit is the unique solution that is physically meaningful. It has
been proved that LAP holds for periodic waveguides in [Hoa11], and we call the solution obtained
from LAP the LAP solution. However, the formulations of LAP solutions from these theoretical results
are still very complicated thus it is difficult to apply them to numerical simulations is still very
challenging. In this paper, with the help of the Floquet-Bloch theory, we set up a simplified formulation
for the LAP solution of scattering problems with an integral representation, when a "small enough"
subset is exclueded for the choice of wave numbers. It is expected that an efficient numerical method
could be established based on the simplified formulation. Another important topic for scattering
problems in periodic waveguides is the spectrum decomposition on periodic operators. As far as
we know, there is no such results and we have successfully established the spectrum decomposition
of the operator, thus the operator is explicitly described by its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,
which are closely related to the Bloch wave solutions. Then the solution is also decomposed into
the generalized eigenfunctions. This gives a better understanding of the structures of the solutions.
