Suppose that $S$ is a surface of positive complexity and $N \subset S$ is a tie neighbourhood of a large
train track $\tau$ in $S$. Suppose that $\alpha$ is a properly immersed, essential, and non-peripheral
arc or curve in $S$. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given $S$, $N$, and $\alpha$, homotopes
$\alpha$ into efficient position with respect to $N$. Proofs for the existence of efficient position
were previously given in [Takarajima,2000] and [MasurMosherSchleimer,2012]. In [Takarajima,2000],
a constructive proof for the existence of efficient position is given for immersed curves on closed
surfaces of genus greater than or equal to two. There is no discussion of the complexity of the implied
algorithm. In [MasurMosherSchleimer,2012], the existence of efficient position is proved for
embedded curves with respect to birecurrent train tracks on surfaces of positive complexity. The
implied algorithm operates via an exhaustive search. No time bounds can be deduced. We note that
the algorithm presented in this thesis and the algorithm suggested by a careful reading of [Takarajima,2000]
coincide in the case of closed surfaces. However, this thesis constitutes more than a time-complexity
analysis of Takarajima's constructive proof. Firstly, we are more general as we allow surfaces
with boundary, whereas Takarajima only considers closed surfaces. Secondly, our combinatorial
set-up uses arcs and curves with transverse self-intersection, whereas the barycentric subdivision
of complementary regions carried out in [Takarajima,2000] forces non-transverse self-intersection
even for curves which are initially embedded. Thirdly, the algorithm in this thesis is formulated
purely in terms of local homotopies, whereas [Takarajima,2000] requires semi-local arguments.
Thus, we can, and do, give pseudocode for our algorithm as well as prove its correctness.
