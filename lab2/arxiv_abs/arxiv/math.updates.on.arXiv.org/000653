A compact Polish foliated space is considered. Part of this work studies coarsely quasi-isometric
invariants of leaves in some residual saturated subset when the foliated space is transitive. In
fact, we also use "equi-" versions of this kind of invariants, which means that the definition is
satisfied with the same constants by some given set of leaves. For instance, the following properties
are proved. Either all dense leaves without holonomy are equi-coarsely quasi-isometric to each
other, or else there exist residually many dense leaves without holonomy such that each of them is
coarsely quasi-isometric to meagerly many leaves. Assuming that the foliated space is minimal,
the first of the above alternatives holds if and if the leaves without holonomy satisfy a condition
called coarse quasi-symmetry. A similar dichotomy holds for the growth type of the leaves, as well
as an analogous characterization of the first alternative in the minimal case, involving a property
called growth symmetry. Moreover some classes of growth are shared, either by residually many leaves,
or by meagerly many leaves. If some leaf without holonomy is amenable, then all dense leaves without
holonomy are equi-amenable, and, in the minimal case, they satisfy a property called amenable symmetry.
Residually many leaves have the same asymptotic dimension. If the foliated space is minimal, then
any pair of nonempty open sets in the Higson coronas of the leaves with holonomy contain homeomorphic
nonempty open subsets. Another part studies limit sets of points in the Higson corona of the leaves,
defined like the usual limit sets of their ends.
