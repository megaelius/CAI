Two closely related topics: higher order Bohr sets and higher order almost automorphy are investigated
in this paper. Both of them are related to nilsystems. In the first part, the problem which can be viewed
as the higher order version of an old question concerning Bohr sets is studied: for any $d\in {\mathbb
N}$ does the collection of $\{n\in {\mathbb Z}: S\cap (S-n)\cap\ldots\cap (S-dn)\neq \emptyset\}$
with $S$ syndetic coincide with that of Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-sets? It is proved that Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-sets
could be characterized via generalized polynomials, and applying this result one side of the problem
is answered affirmatively: for any Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-set $A$, there exists a syndetic set $S$ such
that $A\supset \{n\in {\mathbb Z}: S\cap (S-n)\cap\ldots\cap (S-dn)\neq \emptyset\}.$ Moreover,
it is shown that the answer of the other side of the problem can be deduced from some result by Bergelson-Host-Kra
if modulo a set with zero density. In the second part, the notion of $d$-step almost automorphic systems
with $d\in{\mathbb N}\cup\{\infty\}$ is introduced and investigated, which is the generalization
of the classical almost automorphic ones. It is worth to mention that some results concerning higher
order Bohr sets will be applied to the investigation. For a minimal topological dynamical system
$(X,T)$ it is shown that the condition $x\in X$ is $d$-step almost automorphic can be characterized
via various subsets of ${\mathbb Z}$ including the dual sets of $d$-step Poincar\'e and Birkhoff
recurrence sets, and Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-sets. Moreover, it turns out that the condition $(x,y)\in
X\times X$ is regionally proximal of order $d$ can also be characterized via various subsets of ${\mathbb
Z}$.
