Several authors have studied the question of when the monoid ring DM of a monoid M over a ring D is a right
and/or left fir (free ideal ring), a semifir, or a 2-fir (definitions recalled in section 1). It is
known that for M nontrivial, a necessary condition for any of these properties to hold is that D be
a division ring. Under that assumption, necessary and sufficient conditions on M are known for DM
to be a right or left fir, and various conditions on M have been proved necessary or sufficient for
DM to be a 2-fir or semifir. A sufficient condition for DM to be a semifir is that M be a direct limit of
monoids which are free products of free monoids and free groups. W.Dicks has conjectured that this
is also necessary. However F.Ced\'o has given an example of a monoid M which is not such a direct limit,
but satisfies the known necessary conditions for DM to be a semifir. It is an open question whether
for this M, the rings DM are semifirs. We note some reformulations of the known necessary conditions
for DM to be a 2-fir or a semifir, motivate Ced\'o's construction and a variant, and recover Ced\'o's
results for both constructions. Any homomorphism from a monoid M into \Z induces a \Z-grading on
DM, and we show that for the two monoids in question, the rings DM are "homogeneous semifirs" with
respect to all such nontrivial \Z-gradings; i.e., have (roughly) the property that every finitely
generated homogeneous one-sided ideal is free. If M is a monoid such that DM is an n-fir, and N a "well-behaved"
submonoid of M, we obtain results on DN. Using these, we show that for M a monoid such that DM is a 2-fir,
mutual commutativity is an equivalence relation on nonidentity elements of M, and each equivalence
class, together with the identity element, is a directed union of infinite cyclic groups or infinite
cyclic monoids. Several open questions are noted.
