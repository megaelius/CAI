The R\'enyi entanglement entropy (REE) of the states excited by local operators in two-dimensional
irrational conformal field theories (CFTs), especially in Liouville field theory (LFT) and $\mathcal{N}=1$
super-Liouville field theory (SLFT), has been investigated. In particular, the excited states
obtained by acting on the vacuum with primary operators were considered. {We start from evaluating
the second REE in a compact $c=1$ free boson field theory at generic radius, which is an irrational
CFT. Then we focus on the two special irrational CFTs, e.g., LFT and SLFT. In these theories, the second
REE of such local excited states becomes divergent in early and late time limits. For simplicity,
we study the memory effect of REE for the two classes of the local excited states in LFT and SLFT. In
order to restore the quasiparticles picture, we define the difference of REE between target and
reference states, which belong to the same class. The variation of the difference of REE between
early and late time limits always coincides with the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements
between target and reference states. Furthermore, the locally excited states by acting generic
descendent operators on the vacuum have been also investigated. The variation of the difference
of REE is the summation of the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements between the target and
reference states, and an additional normalization factor. Since the identity operator (or vacuum
state) does not live in the Hilbert space of LFT and SLFT and no discrete terms contribute to REE in
the intermediate channel, the variation of the difference of REE between target and reference states
is no longer the log of the quantum dimension which is shown in the 1+1-dimensional rational CFTs
(RCFTs).
