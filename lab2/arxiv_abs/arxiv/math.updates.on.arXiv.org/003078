In this paper, we are concerned with the fractional and higher order H\'{e}non-Hardy equations
\begin{equation*} (-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}u(x)=|x|^{a}u^{p}(x) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
\text{in} \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^{n} \,\,\, \text{or} \,\,\, \mathbb{R}^{n}_{+} \end{equation*}
with $n\geq2$, $0<\alpha<2$ or $\alpha=2m$ with $1\leq m<\frac{n}{2}$, $-\alpha<a<+\infty$
and $0<p<\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$. By developing a method of scaling spheres, we prove
Liouville theorems for nonnegative solutions to the above H\'{e}non-Hardy equations in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
When $a>0$, our results extend the known Liouville type theorems for $1<p<\frac{n+\alpha+a}{n-\alpha}$
to the full range $0<p<\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$. In particular, when $m=1$, our results
give a complete and affirmative answer to the open conjecture posed by Q. Phan and P. Souplet \cite{PS}.
As other applications of the method of scaling spheres, we also establish the Liouville theorem
for fractional order and second order H\'{e}non-Hardy equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions
on $\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$ for all $1\leq p<\frac{n+\alpha+2a}{n-\alpha}$, and Liouville theorem
for higher order Lane-Emden equations (i.e., $\alpha=2m$ and $a=0$) with Navier boundary conditions
on $\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}$ for all $1<p\leq\frac{n+2m}{n-2m}$. Then as an immediate application,
we derive a priori estimates and existence of positive solutions to higher order Lane-Emden equations
in bounded domains for all $1<p<\frac{n+2m}{n-2m}$. Our theorems extend the results in W. Chen,
Y. Fang and C. Li \cite{CFL} and W. Dai, S. Peng and G. Qin \cite{DPQ} remarkably to the maximal range
of $p$. We believe the method of scaling spheres developed here can be applied to various fractional
or higher order problems without translation invariance or in the cases Kelvin transforms in conjunction
with the method of moving planes do not work.
