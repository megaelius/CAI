This paper considers an artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit design for multi-user MIMO systems
with integrated services. Specifically, two sorts of service messages are combined and served
simultaneously: one multicast message intended for all receivers and one confidential message
intended for only one receiver and required to be perfectly secure from other unauthorized receivers.
Our interest lies in the joint design of input covariances of the multicast message, confidential
message and artificial noise (AN), such that the achievable secrecy rate and multicast rate are
simultaneously maximized. This problem is identified as a secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM)
problem in the context of physical-layer service integration. Since this bi-objective optimization
problem is inherently complex to solve, we put forward two different scalarization methods to convert
it into a scalar optimization problem. First, we propose to prefix the multicast rate as a constant,
and accordingly, the primal biobjective problem is converted into a secrecy rate maximization
(SRM) problem with quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraint. By varying the constant, we
can obtain different Pareto optimal points. The resulting SRM problem can be iteratively solved
via a provably convergent difference-of-concave (DC) algorithm. In the second method, we aim to
maximize the weighted sum of the secrecy rate and the multicast rate. Through varying the weighted
vector, one can also obtain different Pareto optimal points. We show that this weighted sum rate
maximization (WSRM) problem can be recast into a primal decomposable form, which is amenable to
alternating optimization (AO). Then we compare these two scalarization methods in terms of their
overall performance and computational complexity via theoretical analysis as well as numerical
simulation, based on which new insights can be drawn.
