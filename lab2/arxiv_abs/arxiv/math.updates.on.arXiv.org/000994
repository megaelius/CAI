This paper studies the secrecy communication in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) system, where a source sends confidential information to a destination in the presence of
a potential eavesdropper. We employ wireless powered cooperative jamming to improve the secrecy
rate of this system with the assistance of a cooperative jammer, which works in the harvest-then-jam
protocol over two time-slots. In the first slot, the source sends dedicated energy signals to power
the jammer; in the second slot, the jammer uses the harvested energy to jam the eavesdropper, in order
to protect the simultaneous secrecy communication from the source to the destination. In particular,
we consider two types of receivers at the destination, namely Type-I and Type-II receivers, which
do not have and have the capability of canceling the (a-priori known) jamming signals, respectively.
For both types of receivers, we maximize the secrecy rate at the destination by jointly optimizing
the transmit power allocation at the source and the jammer over sub-carriers, as well as the time
allocation between the two time-slots. First, we present the globally optimal solution to this
problem via the Lagrange dual method, which, however, is of high implementation complexity. Next,
to balance tradeoff between the algorithm complexity and performance, we propose alternative
low-complexity solutions based on minorization maximization and heuristic successive optimization,
respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches significantly improve the
secrecy rate, as compared to benchmark schemes without joint power and time allocation.
