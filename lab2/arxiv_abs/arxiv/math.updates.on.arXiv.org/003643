We consider the problem of searching for an unknown target vertex $t$ in a (possibly edge-weighted)
graph. Each \emph{vertex-query} points to a vertex $v$ and the response either admits $v$ is the
target or provides any neighbor $s\not=v$ that lies on a shortest path from $v$ to $t$. This model
has been introduced for trees by Onak and Parys [FOCS 2006] and for general graphs by Emamjomeh-Zadeh
et al. [STOC 2016]. In the latter, the authors provide algorithms for the error-less case and for
the independent noise model (where each query independently receives an erroneous answer with
known probability $p<1/2$ and a correct one with probability $1-p$). We study this problem in both
adversarial errors and independent noise models. First, we show an algorithm that needs $\frac{\log_2
n}{1 - H(r)}$ queries against \emph{adversarial} errors, where adversary is bounded with its rate
of errors by a known constant $r<1/2$. Our algorithm is in fact a simplification of previous work,
and our refinement lies in invoking amortization argument. We then show that our algorithm coupled
with Chernoff bound argument leads to an algorithm for independent noise that is simpler and with
a query complexity that is both simpler and asymptotically better to one of Emamjomeh-Zadeh et al.
[STOC 2016]. Our approach has a wide range of applications. First, it improves and simplifies Robust
Interactive Learning framework proposed by Emamjomeh-Zadeh et al. [NIPS 2017]. Secondly, performing
analogous analysis for \emph{edge-queries} (where query to edge $e$ returns its endpoint that
is closer to target) we actually recover (as a special case) noisy binary search algorithm that is
asymptotically optimal, matching the complexity of Feige et al. [SIAM J. Comput. 1994]. Thirdly,
we improve and simplify upon existing algorithm for searching of \emph{unbounded} domains due
to Aslam and Dhagat [STOC 1991].
