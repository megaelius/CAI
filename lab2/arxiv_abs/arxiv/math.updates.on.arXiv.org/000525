We consider the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, the central model in the study of electronic properties
of one-dimensional quasicrystals, and provide a detailed description of its spectrum and spectral
characteristics (namely, the optimal H\"older exponent of the integrated density of states, the
dimension of the density of states measure, the dimension of the spectrum, and the upper transport
exponent) for all values of the coupling constant (in contrast to all previous quantitative results,
which could be established only in the regime of small or large coupling). In particular, we show
that the spectrum of this operator is a dynamically defined Cantor set and that the density of states
measure is exact-dimensional; this implies that all standard fractal dimensions coincide in each
case. We show that all the gaps of the spectrum allowed by the gap labeling theorem are open for all
values of the coupling constant. Also, we establish strict inequalities between the four spectral
characteristics in question, and provide the exact large coupling asymptotics of the dimension
of the density of states measure (for the other three quantities, the large coupling asymptotics
were known before). A crucial ingredient of the paper is the relation between spectral properties
of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian and dynamical properties of the Fibonacci trace map (such as dimensional
characteristics of the non-wandering hyperbolic set and its measure of maximal entropy as well
as other equilibrium measures, topological entropy, multipliers of periodic orbits). We establish
exact identities relating the spectral and dynamical quantities, and show the connection between
the spectral quantities and the thermodynamic pressure function.
