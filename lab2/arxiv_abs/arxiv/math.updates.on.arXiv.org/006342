Due to the advantage of capacity-achieving, polar codes have been extended to the block fading channel
whereas most constructions involve complex iterative-calculation. In this paper, we establish
a systematic framework to analyze the error performance of polar codes in the case of block mapping
and random mapping. For both the mappings, by introducing the new concept, named split polar spectrum,
we derive the upper bound on the error probability of polarized channel which explicitly reveals
the relationship between the diversity order L and the block-wise weight distribution of the codeword.
For the special case L=2 in the block mapping, we design the enumeration algorithm to calculate the
exact split polar spectrum based on the general MacWilliams identities. For arbitrary diversity
order in the random mapping, with the help of uniform interleaving, we derive the approximate split
polar spectrum by combining the polar spectrum and the probability of fading pattern for a specific
weight. Furthermore, we propose the design criteria to construct polar codes over the block fading
channel. The full diversity criterion is the primary target so as to achieve the diversity gain and
the product distance criterion requires to maximize the product of the block-wise Hamming distance
whereby obtain the coding gain. Guided by these design criteria, the construction metric, named
polarized diversity weight (PDW) is proposed to design the polar codes in both mappings. Such a simple
metric can construct polar codes with similar or better performance over those based on traditional
methods in block fading channel.
