The Sine-Gordon model is obtained by tilting the law of a log-correlated Gaussian field $X$ defined
on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by the exponential of its cosine, namely $\exp(\alpha \smallint \cos
(\beta X))$. It is an important model in quantum field theory or in statistic physics like in the study
of log-gases. In spite of its relatively simple definition, the model has a very rich phenomenology.
While the integral $\smallint \cos (\beta X)$ can properly be defined when $\beta^2<d$ using the
standard Wick normalisation of $\cos (\beta X)$, a more involved renormalization procedure is
needed when $\beta^2\in [d,2d)$. In particular it exhibits a countable sequence of phase transition
accumulating to the left of $\beta=\sqrt{2d}$, each transitions corresponding to the addition
of an extra term in the renormalization scheme. The final threshold $\beta=\sqrt{2}$ corresponds
to the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase transition of the $\log$-gas. In this paper, we present a
novel probabilistic approach to renormalization of the two-dimensional boundary (or 1-dimensional)
Sine-Gordon model up to the KT threshold $\beta=\sqrt{2}$. The purpose of this approach is to propose
a simple and flexible method to treat this problem which, unlike the existing renormalization group
techniques, does not rely on translation invariance for the covariance kernel of $X$ or the reference
measure along which $\cos (\beta X)$ is integrated. To this purpose we establish by induction a general
formula for the cumulants of a random variable. We apply this formula to study the cumulants of (approximations
of) $\smallint \cos (\beta X)$. To control all terms produced by the induction proceedure, we prove
a refinement of classical electrostatic inequalities, which allows to bound the energy of configurations
in terms of the Wasserstein distance between $+$ and $-$ charges.
