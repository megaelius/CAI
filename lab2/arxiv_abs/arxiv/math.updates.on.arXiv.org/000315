This article focuses on the mathematical problem of reconstructing dynamic permeability $K(\omega)$
of two-phase composites from data at different frequencies, utilizing the analytic structure
of the Stieltjes function representation of $K(\omega)$ derived by Avellaneda and Tortquato in
\cite{avellaneda1991rigorous-link-b}, which is valid for all pore space geometry. The integral
representation formula (IRF) for dynamic tortuosity is derived and its analytic structure exploited
for reconstructing the function from a finite data set. All information of pore-space microstructure
is contained in the measure of the IRF. The theory of multipoint Pad\'{e} approximates for Stieltjes
functions guarantees the existence of relaxation kernels that can approximate the dynamic permeability
function and the dynamic tortuosity function with high accuracy. In this paper, a numerical algorithm
is proposed for computing the relaxation time and the corresponding strength for each element in
the relaxation kernels; in the frequency domain, the approximation can be regarded as approximating
the Stieltjes function by rational functions with simple poles and positive residues. With the
idea from dehomogenization, we also established the exact relations between the moments of the
positive measures in the IRFs of permeability and tortuosity with two important parameters in the
theory of poroelasticity: the infinite-frequency tortuosity $\alpha_\infty$ for general case
and the weighted volume-to-surface ratio $\Lambda$ for the JKD model. From these relations, we
suggest a new way for evaluating these two microstructure-dependent parameters from a finite data
set of permeability and given values of porosity $\phi$ and pore fluid kinetic viscosity $\nu$.
Numerical results for JKD permeability and tortuosity are presented.
