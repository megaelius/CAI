Real-world populations exhibit heterogeneous features and it is crucial that researchers develop
improved models and modelling approaches able to capture and quantify their effects. Amongst others,
the duration, type and structure of connections play a crucial role in how diseases invade and spread
through populations. Here, we incorporate the aforementioned heterogeneities into a model by
considering a dual-layer static-dynamic multiplex network. The static network layer affords
tunable clustering and describes an individual's permanent community or household structure.
The dynamic network layer imposes edge rewiring at a constant rate, and describes an individual's
transient connections made with individuals in the wider population. We follow the edge-based
compartmental modelling approach to derive model equations describing the time evolution of a
susceptible - infected - recovered (SIR) epidemic process spreading through a multiplex network
of individuals, and we derive the basic reproduction number, measuring the expected number of new
infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population.
We validate model equations by showing convergence to pre-existing edge-based compartmental
model equations in limiting cases and by comparison with stochastically simulated epidemics.
We explore the effects of altering model parameters and multiplex network attributes on resultant
epidemic dynamics. We discover behavioural regimes that the model can achieve by exploring distinct
parameter settings for rewiring and infection rates. We validate the basic reproduction number
by plotting its value against associated final epidemic sizes measured from simulation and predicted
by model equations for a number of setups. Further, we explore the effect of varying individual model
parameters on the basic reproduction number.
