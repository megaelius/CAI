Subspace codes are known to be useful in error-correction for random network coding. Recently,
they were used to prove that vector network codes outperform scalar linear network codes, on multicast
networks, with respect to the alphabet size. The multicast networks which were used are generalized
combination networks. In both the scalar and the vector network coding solutions, the subspace
distance is used as the distance measure for the codes which solve the network coding problem in the
generalized combination networks. In this work we show that for a general network coding solution
for the generalized combination networks, we can replace the subspace distance with two other possible
distance measures which generalize the subspace distance. The two distance measures are shown
to be equivalent under an orthogonal transformation. We show that the Grassmannian codes with the
new distance measures generalize the subspace codes and the subspace designs with the subspace
distance and the strength of the design, respectively. We prove that each code with the largest number
of codewords and one of the generalized distances, given the other parameters, has the minimum requirements
needed to solve a given generalized combination network with a scalar linear network code. We discuss
the coding problems related to these two distance measures. The codes on which the new distance measures
are applied, are Grassmannian codes, known also as constant dimension codes. These codes are $q$-analog
of related codes in the Hamming scheme, which are constant weight codes. We define the related distance
measures for the Hamming scheme. Finally, we consider codes in the Hamming scheme as a subfamily
of the new codes. This is done by considering a few different approaches, some of them is by considering
the related network coding problem.
