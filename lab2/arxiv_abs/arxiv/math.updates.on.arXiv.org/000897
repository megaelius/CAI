The problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) from replicated databases with
colluding servers and adversaries is studied. Specifically, the database comprises $K$ files,
which are replicatively stored among $N$ servers. A user wants to retrieve one file from the database
by communicating with the $N$ servers, without revealing the identity of the desired file to any
server. Furthermore, the user shall learn nothing about the other $K-1$ files. Any $T$ out of $N$
servers may collude, that is, they may communicate their interactions with the user to guess the
identity of the requested file. An adversary in the system can tap in on or even try to corrupt the communication.
Three types of adversaries are considered: a Byzantine adversary who can overwrite the transmission
of any $B$ servers to the user; a passive eavesdropper who can tap in on the incoming and outgoing transmissions
of any $E$ servers; and a combination of both -- an adversary who can tap in on a set of any $E$ nodes,
and overwrite the transmission of a set of any $B$ nodes. The problems of SPIR with colluding servers
and the three types of adversaries are named T-BSPIR, T-ESPIR and T-BESPIR respectively. The capacity
of the problem is defined as the maximum number of information bits of the desired file retrieved
per downloaded bit. We show that the information-theoretical capacity of T-BSPIR equals $1-\frac{2B+T}{N}$,
if the servers share common randomness (unavailable at the user) with amount at least $\frac{2B+T}{N-2B-T}$
times the file size. Otherwise, the capacity equals zero. The capacity of T-ESPIR is proved to equal
$1-\frac{\max(T,E)}{N}$, with common randomness at least $\frac{\max(T,E)}{N-\max(T,E)}$
times the file size. Finally, the capacity of T-BESPIR is proved to be $1-\frac{2B+\max(T,E)}{N}$,
with common randomness at least $\frac{2B+\max(T,E)}{N-2B-\max(T,E)}$ times the file size.
