We present a PDE-based approach for finding optimal paths for the Reeds-Shepp car. In our model we
minimize a (data-driven) functional involving both curvature and length penalization, with several
generalizations. Our approach encompasses the two and three dimensional variants of this model,
state dependent costs, and moreover, the possibility of removing the reverse gear of the vehicle.
We prove both global and local controllability results of the models. Via eikonal equations on the
manifold $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ we compute distance maps w.r.t. highly anisotropic
Finsler metrics, which approximate the singular (quasi)-distances underlying the model. This
is achieved using a Fast-Marching (FM) method, building on work by Mirebeau. The FM method is based
on specific discretization stencils which are adapted to the preferred directions of the Finsler
metric and obey a generalized acuteness property. The shortest paths can be found with a gradient
descent method on the distance map, which we formalize in a theorem. We justify the use of our approximating
metrics by proving convergence results. Our curve optimization model in $\mathbb{R}^{d} \times
\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ with data-driven cost allows to extract complex tubular structures from medical
images, e.g. crossings, and incomplete data due to occlusions or low contrast. Our work extends
the results of Sanguinetti et al. on numerical sub-Riemannian eikonal equations and the Reeds-Shepp
Car to 3D, with comparisons to exact solutions by Duits et al. Numerical experiments show the high
potential of our method in two applications: vessel tracking in retinal images for the case $d=2$,
and brain connectivity measures from diffusion weighted MRI-data for the case $d=3$, extending
the work of Bekkers et al. We demonstrate how the new model without reverse gear better handles bifurcations.
