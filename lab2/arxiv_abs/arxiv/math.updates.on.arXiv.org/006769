The standard nonperturbative approaches of renormalization group for tensor models are generally
focused on a purely local potential approximation (i.e. involving only generalized traces and
product of them) and are showed to strongly violate the modified Ward identities. This paper as a
continuation of our recent contribution [Physical Review D 101, 106015 (2020)], intended to investigate
the approximation schemes compatibles with Ward identities and constraints between $2n$-points
observables in the large $N$-limit. We consider separately two different approximations: In the
first one, we try to construct a local potential approximation from a slight modification of the
Litim regulator, so that it remains optimal in the usual sense, and preserves the boundary conditions
in deep UV and deep IR limits. In the second one, we introduce derivative couplings in the truncations
and show that the compatibility with Ward identities implies strong relations between $\beta$-functions,
allowing to close the infinite hierarchy of flow equations in the non-branching sector, up to a given
order in the derivative expansion. Finally, using exact relation between correlations functions
in large $N$-limit, we show that strictly local truncations are insufficient to reach the exact
value for the critical exponent, highlighting the role played by these strong relations between
observables taking into account the behavior of the flow; and the role played by the multi-trace
operators, discussed in the two different approximation schemes. In both cases, we compare our
conclusions to the results obtained in the literature and conclude that, at a given order, taking
into account the exact functional relations between observables like Ward identities in a systematic
way we can strongly improve the physical relevance of the approximation for exact RG equation.
