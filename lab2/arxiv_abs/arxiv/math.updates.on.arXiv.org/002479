The Laplacian plays a major role in the mathematical analysis of partial differential equations.
Recently, the work of J. Kigami, taken up by R. S. Strichartz, allowed the construction of an operator
of the same nature, defined locally, on graphs having a fractal character: the triangle of Sierpinski,
the carpet of Sierpinski, the diamond fractal, the Julia sets, the fern of Barnsley. Strangely,
the case of the graph of the Weierstrass function, introduced in 1872 by K. Weierstrass, which presents
self similarity properties, does not seem to have been considered anywhere. It is yet an obligatory
passage, in the perspective of studying diffusion phenomena in irregular structures. We have asked
ourselves the following question: given a continuous function u on the graph of the Weierstrass
function, under which conditions is it possible to associate to u a function Delta u which is, in the
weak sense, its Laplacian ? We present, in the following, the results obtained by following the approach
of J. Kigami and R. S. Strichartz. Ours is made in a completely renewed framework, as regards, the
one, affine, of the Sierpinski gasket. First, we concentrate on Dirichlet forms, on the graph of
the Weierstrass function, which enable us the, subject to its existence, to define the Laplacian
of a continuous function on this graph. This Laplacian appears as the renormalized limit of a sequence
of discrete Laplacians on a sequence of graphs which converge to the one of the Weierstrass function.
The normalization constants related to each graph Laplacian are obtained thanks Dirichlet forms.
The spectrum of the Laplacian thus built is obtained through spectral decimation.
