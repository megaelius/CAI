In previous work with M.C. Fernandes, we found a Lie algebroid symmetry for the Einstein evolution
equations. The present work allows us to explain the coisotropic structure of the constraint subset
for the initial value problem by extending the notion of hamiltonian structure from Lie algebra
actions to a general Lie algebroid $A$ over a presymplectic manifold $M$: After comparing possible
compatibility conditions between the anchor map $A\to TM$ and the presymplectic structure on the
base, we choose the most natural of them, given in terms of a suitably chosen connection on $A$. We
define a notion of momentum section of $A^*$ and a condition for compatibility with the Lie bracket.
A Lie algebroid over a presymplectic manifold with compatible anchor and momentum section is then
called hamiltonian. For an action Lie algebroid with the trivial connection, we retrieve the conditions
of a hamiltonian action. We show that the clean zero locus of the momentum section of a hamiltonian
Lie algebroid is a coisotropic submanifold. To define morphisms of hamiltonian Lie algebroids,
we express the structure in terms of a bigraded algebra generated by Lie algebroid forms and de Rham
forms on its base. We show that a bracket-compatible momentum map is equivalent to a closed basic
extension of the presymplectic form, within the generalization of the BRST model of equivariant
cohomology to Lie algebroids. We construct groupoids by reduction of an action Lie groupoid $G\times
M$ by a subgroup $H$ of $G$ which is not necessarily normal, and we find conditions which imply that
a hamiltonian structure descends to such a reduced Lie algebroid. We consider many examples and,
in particular, find that the tangent Lie algebroid over a symplectic manifold is hamiltonian with
respect to some connection if and only if the symplectic structure has a nowhere vanishing primitive.
