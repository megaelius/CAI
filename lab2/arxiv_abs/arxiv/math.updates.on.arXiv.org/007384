We study periodic review stochastic inventory control in the data-driven setting, in which the
retailer makes ordering decisions based only on historical demand observations without any knowledge
of the probability distribution of the demand. Since an $(s, S)$-policy is optimal when the demand
distribution is known, we investigate the statistical properties of the data-driven $(s, S)$-policy
obtained by recursively computing the empirical cost-to-go functions. This policy is inherently
challenging to analyze because the recursion induces propagation of the estimation error backwards
in time. In this work, we establish the asymptotic properties of this data-driven policy by fully
accounting for the error propagation. First, we rigorously show the consistency of the estimated
parameters by filling in some gaps (due to unaccounted error propagation) in the existing studies.
On the other hand, empirical process theory cannot be directly applied to show asymptotic normality.
To explain, the empirical cost-to-go functions for the estimated parameters are not i.i.d. sums,
again due to the error propagation. Our main methodological innovation comes from an asymptotic
representation for multi-sample $U$-processes in terms of i.i.d. sums. This representation enables
us to apply empirical process theory to derive the influence functions of the estimated parameters
and establish joint asymptotic normality. Based on these results, we also propose an entirely data-driven
estimator of the optimal expected cost and we derive its asymptotic distribution. We demonstrate
some useful applications of our asymptotic results, including sample size determination, as well
as interval estimation and hypothesis testing on vital parameters of the inventory problem. The
results from our numerical simulations conform to our theoretical analysis.
