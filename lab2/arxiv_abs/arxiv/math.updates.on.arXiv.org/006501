Let $G$ be a topological Abelian semigroup with unit, let $E$ be a Banach space, and let $C(G,E)$ denote
the set of continuous functions $f\colon G\to E$. A function $f\in C(G,E)$ is a generalized polynomial,
if there is an $n\ge 0$ such that $\Delta_{h_1} \ldots \Delta_{h_{n+1}} f=0$ for every $h_1 ,\ldots
, h_{n+1} \in G$, where $\Delta_h$ is the difference operator. We say that $f\in C(G,E)$ is a polynomial,
if it is a generalized polynomial, and the linear span of its translates is of finite dimension; $f$
is a w-polynomial, if $u\circ f$ is a polynomial for every $u\in E^*$, and $f$ is a local polynomial,
if it is a polynomial on every finitely generated subsemigroup. We show that each of the classes of
polynomials, w-polynomials, generalized polynomials, local polynomials is contained in the
next class. If $G$ is an Abelian group and has a dense subgroup with finite torsion free rank, then
these classes coincide. We introduce the classes of exponential polynomials and w-expo\-nential
polynomials as well, establish their representations and connection with polynomials and w-polynomials.
We also investigate spectral synthesis and analysis in the class $C(G,E)$. It is known that if $G$
is a compact Abelian group and $E$ is a Banach space, then spectral synthesis holds in $C(G,E)$. On
the other hand, we show that if $G$ is an infinite and discrete Abelian group and $E$ is a Banach space
of infinite dimension, then even spectral analysis fails in $C(G,E)$. If, however, $G$ is discrete,
has finite torsion free rank and if $E$ is a Banach space of finite dimension, then spectral synthesis
holds in $C(G,E)$.
