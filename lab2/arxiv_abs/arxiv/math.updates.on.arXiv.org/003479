Multiple testing literature contains ample research on controlling false discoveries for hypotheses
classified according to one criterion, which we refer to as one-way classified hypotheses. Although
simultaneous classification of hypotheses according to two different criteria, resulting in
two-way classified hypotheses, do often occur in scientific studies, no such research has taken
place yet, as far as we know, under this structure. This article produces procedures, both in their
oracle and data-adaptive forms, for controlling the overall false discovery rate (FDR) across
all hypotheses effectively capturing the underlying one- or two-way classification structure.
They have been obtained by using results associated with weighted Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure
in their more general forms providing guidance on how to adapt the original BH procedure to the underlying
one- or two-way classification structure through an appropriate choice of the weights. The FDR
is maintained non-asymptotically by our proposed procedures in their oracle forms under positive
regression dependence on subset of null $p$-values (PRDS) and in their data-adaptive forms under
independence of the $p$-values. Possible control of FDR for our data-adaptive procedures in certain
scenarios involving dependent $p$-values have been investigated through simulations. The fact
that our suggested procedures can be superior to contemporary practices has been demonstrated
through their applications in simulated scenarios and to real-life data sets. While the procedures
proposed here for two-way classified hypotheses are new, the data-adaptive procedure obtained
for one-way classified hypotheses is alternative to and often more powerful than those proposed
in Hu et al. (2010).
