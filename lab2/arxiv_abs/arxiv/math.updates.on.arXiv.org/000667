The holomorphic anomaly equations describe B-model closed topological strings in Calabi-Yau
geometries. Having been used to construct perturbative expansions, it was recently shown that
they can also be extended past perturbation theory by making use of resurgent transseries. These
yield formal nonperturbative solutions, showing integrability of the holomorphic anomaly equations
at the nonperturbative level. This paper takes such constructions one step further by working out
in great detail the specific example of topological strings in the mirror of the local $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$
toric Calabi-Yau background, and by addressing the associated (resurgent) large-order analysis
of both perturbative and multi-instanton sectors. In particular, analyzing the asymptotic growth
of the perturbative free energies, one finds contributions from three different instanton actions
related by $Z_3$ symmetry, alongside another action related to the K\"ahler parameter. Resurgent
transseries methods then compute, from the extended holomorphic anomaly equations, higher instanton
sectors and it is shown that these precisely control the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative
free energies, as dictated by resurgence. The asymptotic large-order growth of the one-instanton
sector unveils the presence of resonance, i.e., each instanton action is necessarily joined by
its symmetric contribution. The structure of different resurgence relations is extensively checked
at the numerical level, both in the holomorphic limit and in the general nonholomorphic case, always
showing excellent agreement with transseries data computed out of the nonperturbative holomorphic
anomaly equations. The resurgence relations further imply that the string free energy displays
an intricate multi-branched Borel structure, and that resonance must be properly taken into account
in order to describe the full transseries solution.
