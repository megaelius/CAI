Category theory in homotopy type theory is intricate as categorical laws can only be stated "up to
homotopy", and thus require coherences. The established notion of a univalent category (Ahrens
et al. 2015) solves this by considering only truncated types, and it roughly corresponds to an ordinary
category. The drawback is that univalent categories fail to capture many naturally occurring structures,
such as type universes or the type of univalent categories themselves. This stems from the fact that
the natural notion of a category in homotopy type theory is not that of an ordinary, but rather a higher
category. Out of the large variety of approaches to higher category theory that mathematicians
have proposed, we believe that, for type theory, the simplicial strategy is best suited. Given the
first (n+3) levels of a semisimplicial type S, we can equip S with three properties: first, contractibility
of the types of certain horn fillers; second, a completeness property; and third, a truncation condition.
We call this a complete semi-Segal n-type. The definition of a univalent (1-) category can easily
be extended or restricted to the definition of a univalent n-category (more precisely, (n,1)-category)
for n in {0,1,2}, and we show that the type of complete semi-Segal n-types is equivalent to the type
of univalent n-categories in these cases. Thus, we believe that the notion of a complete semi-Segal
n-type can be taken as the definition of a univalent n-category. We develop most of the material of
the paper without assuming truncatedness conditions and only apply such conditions at the end to
ensure that the structure is well-behaved. This increases modularity since every new level of wild
structure can be built on top of the previous levels. We provide a formalisation in the proof assistant
Agda using a completely explicit representation of semi-simplicial types for levels up to 4.
