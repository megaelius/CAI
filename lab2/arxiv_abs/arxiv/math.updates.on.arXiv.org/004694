We present a statistical learning framework for robust identification of partial differential
equations from noisy spatiotemporal data. Extending previous sparse regression approaches for
inferring PDE models from simulated data, we address key issues that have thus far limited the application
of these methods to noisy experimental data, namely their robustness against noise and the need
for manual parameter tuning. We address both points by proposing a stability-based model selection
scheme to determine the level of regularization required for reproducible recovery of the underlying
PDE. This avoids manual parameter tuning and provides a principled way to improve the method's robustness
against noise in the data. Our stability selection approach, termed PDE-STRIDE, can be combined
with any sparsity-promoting penalized regression model and provides an interpretable criterion
for model component importance. We show that in particular the combination of stability selection
with the iterative hard-thresholding algorithm from compressed sensing provides a fast, parameter-free,
and robust computational framework for PDE inference that outperforms previous algorithmic approaches
with respect to recovery accuracy, amount of data required, and robustness to noise. We illustrate
the performance of our approach on a wide range of noise-corrupted simulated benchmark problems,
including 1D Burgers, 2D vorticity-transport, and 3D reaction-diffusion problems. We demonstrate
the practical applicability of our method on real-world data by considering a purely data-driven
re-evaluation of the advective triggering hypothesis for an embryonic polarization system in
C.~elegans. Using fluorescence microscopy images of C.~elegans zygotes as input data, our framework
is able to recover the PDE model for the regulatory reaction-diffusion-flow network of the associated
proteins.
