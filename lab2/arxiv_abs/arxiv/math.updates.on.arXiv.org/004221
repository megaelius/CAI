This paper explores the capacity limits of a wireless cellular network with full-duplex (FD) base
station (BS) and half-duplex user terminals, in which three independent messages are communicated,
i.e., uplink message $m_1$ from the uplink user to the BS, downlink message $m_2$ from the BS to the
downlink user, and D2D message $m_3$ from the uplink user to the downlink user. Information theoretically,
this wireless system can be interpreted as a generalization of the FD relay broadcast channel with
side message transmitted from relay to destination. Our study starts with a simpler case that has
only the uplink and the downlink transmissions of $(m_1,m_2)$. For the discrete memoryless channel
model, we propose a novel strategy that uses the BS as a FD relay to facilitate interference cancellation.
The paper further provides a new converse which is strictly tighter than the cut-set bound. Taken
together and specialized to the Gaussian case, our inner and outer bounds yield a characterization
of the capacity to within a constant gap for the scalar and the vector Gaussian channel models. Furthermore,
the paper studies a general setup with $(m_1,m_2,m_3)$. For the discrete memoryless channel model,
we incorporate Marton's broadcast coding to obtain an achievable rate region, which is larger than
the existing ones. Regarding the converse, we derive a nontrivial outer bound by means of genie.
For the scalar Gaussian channel model, it is shown that by using one of the two rate-splitting schemes
depending on the channel condition, we can already achieve the capacity to within a constant gap.
For the vector Gaussian channel model, we further show how dirty paper coding can be applied to coordinate
the transmissions of $(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ in three different ways. Finally, simulations demonstrate
the advantages of using the BS as a relay in the FD cellular network.
