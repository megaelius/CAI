This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network
(WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically.
The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the
downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in
the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility
of the UAV via periodic trajectory design, jointly with the transmission resource allocation optimization,
to improve the system performance. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum)
throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed
constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulting problem is non-convex
and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case
without the maximum UAV speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem.
The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground
locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next,
based on the above multi-location-hovering solution, we propose a successive hover-and-fly trajectory,
jointly with the downlink and uplink power allocations, to find an efficient suboptimal solution
to the problem with the maximum UAV speed constraint. Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled
WPCN achieves significant common throughput gain over the conventional WPCN with a fixed-location
AP.
