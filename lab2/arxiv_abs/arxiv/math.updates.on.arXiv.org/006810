A linear programming (LP) model is proposed to improve the performance of a controlled freeway during
an emergency evacuation. Based on reasonable assumptions, the main relationships among key factors
are kept without the uncertain impact of subordinate factors in this model. Three vital issues related
to optimal freeway control during an emergency evacuation are addressed. How to properly realize
some predetermined priorities assigned to some on-ramps during an emergency evacuation is analyzed
through sensitivity analysis of objective function coefficients. The time-varying throughput
capacity of freeway mainline and the storage capacities of on-ramps are also addressed by using
sensitivity analysis of the right-hand side (RHS) of corresponding constraints. The last key issue
we focused on is how to deal with the uncertain demand in a crude form by applying robust optimization.
The methodology presented in this paper can help evacuation managers realize a coordinated ramp
metering with predetermined priorities put on some on-ramps during an emergency evacuation. The
result obtained by analyzing the impact of time-varying mainline capacity provides the evacuation
manager a chance of using the extra capacity in some segments of mainline to buffer the traffic so
as to reduce the congestion related to upstream on-ramps. To reduce the risk due to the possible infeasibility
of deterministic control approaches in an uncertain situation, we apply an affinely adjustable
robust counterpart (AARC) approach to deal with uncertain dynamic demands restricted to polyhedral
sets. The preliminary numerical experiments show that the AARC approach provides us with a promising
solution comparing to the sampling based stochastic approach.
