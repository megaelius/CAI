We study singularity properties of word maps on semisimple algebraic groups and Lie algebras, generalizing
the work of Aizenbud-Avni in the case of the commutator map. Given a word $w$ in a free Lie algebra $\mathcal{L}_{r}$,
it induces a word map $\varphi_{w}:\mathfrak{g}^{r}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$ for every semisimple
Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Given two words $w_{1}\in\mathcal{L}_{r_{1}}$ and $w_{2}\in\mathcal{L}_{r_{2}}$,
we define and study the convolution of the corresponding word maps $\varphi_{w_{1}}*\varphi_{w_{2}}:=\varphi_{w_{1}}+\varphi_{w_{2}}:\mathfrak{g}^{r_{1}+r_{2}}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$.
We show that for any word $w\in\mathcal{L}_{r}$ of degree $d$, and any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$
with $\varphi_{w}(\mathfrak{g}^{r})\neq0$, one obtains a flat morphism with reduced fibers
of rational singularities (abbreviated an (FRS) morphism) after taking $O(d^{6})$ self-convolutions
of $\varphi_{w}$. We deduce that a group word map of length $\ell$ becomes (FRS) at $(e,\ldots,e)\in
G^{r}$ after $O(\ell^{6})$ self-convolutions, for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. We furthermore
bound the dimensions of the jet schemes of the fibers of Lie algebra word maps, and the fibers of group
word maps in the case where $G=\mathrm{SL}_{n}$. For the commutator word $\nu=[X,Y]$, we show that
$\varphi_{\nu}^{*4}$ is (FRS) for any semisimple Lie algebra, obtaining applications in representation
growth of compact $p$-adic and arithmetic groups. The singularity properties we consider, such
as the (FRS) property, are intimately connected to the point count of fibers over finite rings of
the form $\mathbb{Z}/p^{k}\mathbb{Z}$. This allows us to relate them to properties of some natural
families of random walks on finite and compact $p$-adic groups. We explore these connections, and
provide applications to $p$-adic probabilistic Waring type problems.
