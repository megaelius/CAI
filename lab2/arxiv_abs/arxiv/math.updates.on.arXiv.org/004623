Maintenance optimization has been extensively studied in the past decades. However, most of the
existing maintenance models focus on single-component systems and are not applicable for complex
systems consisting of multiple components, due to various interactions between the components.
Multi-component maintenance optimization problem, which joins the stochastic processes regarding
the failures of the components with the combinatorial problems regarding the grouping of maintenance
activities, is challenging in both modeling and solution techniques, and has remained as an open
issue in the literature. In this paper, we study the multi-component maintenance problem over a
finite planning horizon and formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic integer program
with decision-dependent uncertainty. There is a lack of general efficient methods to solve this
type of problem. To address this challenge, we use an alternative approach to model the underlying
failure process and develop a novel two-stage model without decision-dependent uncertainty.
Structural properties of the two-stage problem are investigated, and a progressive-hedging-based
heuristic is developed based on the structural properties. Our heuristic algorithm demonstrates
a significantly improved capacity in handling practically large-size two-stage problems comparing
to three conventional methods for stochastic integer programming, and solving the two-stage model
by our heuristic in a rolling horizon provides a good approximation of the multi-stage problem.
The heuristic is further benchmarked with a dynamic programming approach commonly adopted in the
literature. Numerical results show that our heuristic can lead to significant cost savings compared
with the benchmark approach.
