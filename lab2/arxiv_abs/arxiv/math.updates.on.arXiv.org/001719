In this work we are interested in the differential geometry of surfaces in simply isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$
and pseudo-isotropic $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ spaces, which is basically the study of $\mathbb{R}^3$
equipped with a degenerate metric: $\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2\pm\mathrm{d}y^2$. Pushing
further results concerning simply isotropic surfaces [B. Pavkovi\'c, Glas. Mat. Ser. III \textbf{15},
149 (1980)], here we introduce a Gauss map in both $\mathbb{I}^3$ and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$
taking values on a certain unit sphere of parabolic type, define a shape operator $L_q$ from it, and
show that the relative Gaussian and Mean curvatures are respectively the determinant and trace
of $L_q$. After proving that every (admissible) pseudo-isotropic surface is timelike, we show
that in analogy to what happens in Lorentz-Minkowski geometry the pseudo-isotropic shape operator
may fail to be diagonalizable. On the other hand, as also happens in simply isotropic space, we prove
that the only totally umbilical surfaces in $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ are spheres of parabolic
type and that the curvature tensor associated with the Levi-Civita connection vanishes identically
for any pseudo-isotropic surface. Later, based on the Gauss map, we introduce a new notion of connection,
named \emph{relative connection} (or \emph{r-connection}, for short), whose curvature tensor
does not vanish identically and is directly related to the relative Gaussian curvature. Finally,
we compute the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations for the r-connection, define \emph{r-geodesics}
as autoparallel curves according to the new connection, and illustrate the new concept by showing
that r-geodesics on a sphere of parabolic type are obtained by intersecting it with planes passing
through its center (focus).
