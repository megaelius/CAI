We propose the application of iterative regularization for the development of ensemble methods
for solving Bayesian inverse problems. In concrete, we construct (i) a variational iterative regularizing
ensemble Levenberg-Marquardt method (IR-enLM) and (ii) a derivative-free iterative ensemble
Kalman smoother (IR-ES). The aim of these methods is to provide a robust ensemble approximation
of the Bayesian posterior. The proposed methods are based on fundamental ideas from iterative regularization
methods that have been widely used for the solution of deterministic inverse problems [21]. In this
work we are interested in the application of the proposed ensemble methods for the solution of Bayesian
inverse problems that arise in reservoir modeling applications. The proposed ensemble methods
use key aspects of the regularizing Levenberg-Marquardt scheme developed by Hanke [16] and that
we recently applied for history matching in [18]. In the case where the forward operator is linear
and the prior is Gaussian, we show that the proposed IR-enLM and IR-ES coincide with standard randomized
maximum likelihood (RML) and the ensemble smoother (ES) respectively. For the general nonlinear
case, we develop a numerical framework to assess the performance of the proposed ensemble methods
at capturing the posterior. This framework consists of using a state-of-the art MCMC method for
resolving the Bayesian posterior from synthetic experiments. The resolved posterior via MCMC
then provides a gold standard against to which compare the proposed IR-enLM and IR-ES. We show that
for the careful selection of regularization parameters, robust approximations of the posterior
can be accomplished in terms of mean and variance. Our numerical experiments showcase the advantage
of using iterative regularization for obtaining more robust and stable approximation of the posterior
than standard unregularized methods.
