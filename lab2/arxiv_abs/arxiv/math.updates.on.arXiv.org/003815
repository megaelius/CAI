The problem addressed is that of optimally controlling, in a decentralized fashion, the download
of mobile video, which is expected to comprise 75 % of total mobile data traffic by 2020. The server
can dynamically choose which packets to download to clients, from among several packets which encode
their videos at different resolutions, as well as the power levels of their transmissions. This
allows it to control packet delivery probabilities, and thereby, for example, avert imminent video
outages at clients. It must however respect the access point's constraints on bandwidth and average
transmission power. The goal is to maximize video "Quality of Experience" (QoE), which depends
on several factors such as (i) outage duration when the video playback buffer is empty, (ii) number
of outage periods, (iii) how many frames downloaded are of lower resolution, (iv) temporal variations
in resolution, etc. It is shown that there exists an optimal decentralized solution where the AP
announces the price of energy, and each client distributedly and dynamically maximizes its own
QoE subject to the cost of energy. A distributed iterative algorithm to solve for optimal decentralized
policy is also presented. Further, for the client-level QoE optimization, the optimal choice of
video-resolution and power-level of packet transmissions has a simple monotonicity and threshold
structure vis-a-vis video playback buffer level. When the number of orthogonal channels is less
than the number of clients, there is an index policy for prioritizing packet transmissions. When
the AP has to simply choose which clients' packets to transmit, the index policy is asymptotically
optimal as the number of channels is scaled up with clients.
