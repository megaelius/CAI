In this paper, a compact third-order gas-kinetic scheme is proposed for the compressible Euler
and Navier-Stokes equations. The main reason for the feasibility to develop such a high-order scheme
with compact stencil, which involves only neighboring cells, is due to the use of a high-order gas
evolution model. Besides the evaluation of the time-dependent flux function across a cell interface,
the high-order gas evolution model also provides an accurate time-dependent solution of the flow
variables at a cell interface. Therefore, the current scheme not only updates the cell averaged
conservative flow variables inside each control volume, but also tracks the flow variables at the
cell interface at the next time level. As a result, with both cell averaged and cell interface values
the high-order reconstruction in the current scheme can be done compactly. Different from using
a weak formulation for high-order accuracy in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, the current
scheme is based on the strong solution, where the flow evolution starting from a piecewise discontinuous
high-order initial data is precisely followed. The cell interface time-dependent flow variables
can be used for the initial data reconstruction at the beginning of next time step. Even with compact
stencil, the current scheme has third-order accuracy in the smooth flow regions, and has favorable
shock capturing property in the discontinuous regions. Many test cases are used to validate the
current scheme. In comparison with many other high-order schemes, the current method avoids the
use of Gaussian points for the flux evaluation along the cell interface and the multi-stage Runge-Kutta
time stepping technique.
