The six-vertex model with domain-wall boundary conditions is one representative of a class of two-dimensional
lattice statistical mechanics models that exhibit a phase separation known as the arctic curve
phenomenon. In the thermodynamic limit, the degrees of freedom are completely frozen in a region
near the boundary, while they are critically fluctuating in a central region. The arctic curve is
the phase boundary that separates those two regions. Critical fluctuations inside the arctic curve
have been studied extensively, both in physics and in mathematics, in free models (i.e., models
that map to free fermions, or equivalently to determinantal point processes). Here we study those
critical fluctuations in the interacting (i.e., not free, not determinantal) six-vertex model,
and provide evidence for the following two claims: (i) the critical fluctuations are given by a Gaussian
Free Field (GFF), as in the free case, but (ii) contrarily to the free case, the GFF is inhomogeneous,
meaning that its coupling constant $K$ becomes position-dependent, $K \rightarrow K({\rm x})$.
The evidence is mainly based on the numerical solution of appropriate Bethe ansatz equations with
an imaginary extensive twist, and on transfer matrix computations, but the second claim is also
supported by the analytic calculation of $K$ and its first two derivatives in selected points. Contrarily
to the usual GFF, this inhomogeneous GFF is not defined in terms of the Green's function of the Laplacian
$\Delta = \nabla \cdot \nabla$ inside the critical domain, but instead, of the Green's function
of a generalized Laplacian $\Delta = \nabla \cdot \frac{1}{K} \nabla$ parametrized by the function
$K$. Surprisingly, we also find that there is a change of regime when $\Delta \leq -1/2$, with $K$
becoming singular at one point.
