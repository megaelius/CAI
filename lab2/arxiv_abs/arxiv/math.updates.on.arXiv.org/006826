We propose new mathematical optimization models for generating sparse graphs/networks that can
achieve synchronization. The synchronization phenomenon is studied using the Kuramoto model,
defined in terms of the adjacency matrix of the graph and the coupling strength of the network, modelling
the so-called coupled oscillators. Besides sparsity, we aim to obtain graphs which have good connectivity
properties, resulting in small coupling strength for synchronization. These properties are in
practice known to be related to a small spectral ratio, namely the ratio of the largest and the second
smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the graph. We formulate three mathematical optimization
models for this purpose. The new objective function and constraints that we propose promote a narrow
range of small degrees. Our first model is a mixed integer optimization problem, which, computationally,
is very challenging, if not impossible, to solve, not only because it involves binary variables
but also some of its variables are functions. The second model is a continuous relaxation of the first
one, and the third is a discretization of the second, which is computationally tractable by employing
standard optimization software. We design graphs by solving the relaxed problem and applying a
practical algorithm for various graph sizes, with randomly generated intrinsic natural frequencies
and initial phase variables. We test robustness of these graphs by carrying out numerical simulations
with random data and constructing the expected value of the network's order parameter and its variance
under this random data, as a guide for assessment.
