We introduce the use of liaison addition to the study of hyperplane arrangements. For an arrangement,
$\mathcal A$, of hyperplanes in $\mathbb P^n$, $\mathcal A$ is free if $R/J$ is Cohen-Macaulay,
where $J$ is the Jacobian ideal of $\mathcal A$. Terao's conjecture says that freeness of $\mathcal
A$ is determined by the combinatorics of the intersection lattice of $\mathcal A$. We study the Cohen-Macaulayness
of three other ideals, all unmixed, that are closely related to $\mathcal A$. Let $\overline J = \mathfrak
q_1 \cap \dots \cap \mathfrak q_s$ be the intersection of height two primary components of $J$ and
$\sqrt{J} = \mathfrak p_1 \cap \dots \cap \mathfrak p_s$ be the radical of $J$. Our third ideal is
$\mathfrak p_1^{b_1} \cap \dots \cap \mathfrak p_s^{b_s}$ for suitable $b_1,\dots, b_s$. With
a mild hypothesis we use liaison addition to show that all of these ideals are Cohen-Macaulay. When
our hypothesis does not hold, we show that these ideals are not necessarily Cohen-Macaulay, and
that Cohen-Macaulayness of any of these ideals does not imply Cohen-Macaulayness of any of the others.
While we do not study the freeness of $\mathcal A$, we show by example that the Betti diagrams can vary
even for arrangements with the same combinatorics. We then study the situation when the hypothesis
does not hold. For equidimensional curves in $\mathbb P^3$, the Hartshorne-Rao module from liaison
theory measures the failure of an ideal to be Cohen-Macaulay, degree by degree, and also determines
the even liaison class of such a curve. We show that for any positive integer $r$ there is an arrangement
$\mathcal A$ for which $R/\overline J$ fails to be Cohen-Macaulay in only one degree, and this failure
is by $r$; we also give an analogous result for $\sqrt{J}$. We draw consequences for the corresponding
even liaison class of the curve defined by $\overline J$ or by $\sqrt{J}$.
