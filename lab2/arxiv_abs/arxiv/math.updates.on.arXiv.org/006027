Apolarity is an important tool in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry which studies a form,
$f$, by the action of polynomial differential operators on $f$. The quotient of all polynomial differential
operators by those which annihilate $f$ is called the apolar algebra of $f$. In general, the apolar
algebra of a form is useful for determining its Waring rank, which can be seen as the problem of decomposing
the supersymmetric tensor, associated to the form, minimally as a sum of rank one supersymmetric
tensors. In this article we study the apolar algebra of a product of linear forms, which generalizes
the case of monomials and connects to the geometry of hyperplane arrangements. In the first part
of the article we provide a bound on the Waring rank of a product of linear forms under certain genericity
assumptions; for this we use the defining equations of so-called star configurations due to Geramita,
Harbourne, and Migliore. In the second part of the article we use the computer algebra system Bertini,
which operates by homotopy continuation methods, to solve certain rank equations for catalecticant
matrices. Our computations suggest that, up to a change of variables, there are exactly six homogeneous
polynomials of degree six in three variables which factor completely as a product of linear forms
defining an irreducible multi-arrangement and whose apolar algebras have dimension six in degree
three. As a consequence of these calculations, we find six cases of such forms with cactus rank six,
five of which also have Waring rank six. Among these are products defining subarrangements of the
braid and Hessian arrangements.
