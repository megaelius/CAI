Let $(X,\mathcal W)$ be a balayage space, $1\in \mathcal W$, or - equivalently - let $\mathcal W$
be the set of excessive functions of a Hunt process on a locally compact space $X$ with countable base
such that $\mathcal W$ separates points, every function in $\mathcal W$ is the supremum of its continuous
minorants and there exist strictly positive continuous $u,v\in \mathcal W$ such that $u/v\to 0$
at infinity. We suppose that there is a Green function $G>0$ for $X$, a metric $\rho$ on $X$ and
a decreasing function $g\colon[0,\infty)\to (0,\infty]$ having the doubling property and a mild
upper decay at infinity such that $G\approx g\circ\rho$ (which is equivalent to a $3G$-inequality).
Then the corresponding capacity for balls of radius $R$ is bounded by a constant multiple of $1/g(R)$.
Assuming that the constant function $1$ is harmonic and the capacity of large balls satisfies a reverse
estimate or that bounded functions are harmonic if and only if they are constant (Liouville property),
it is proven that Wiener's test at infinity shows, if a given set $A$ in $X$ is unavoidable, that is,
if the process hits $A$ with probability one, wherever it starts. An application yields that locally
finite unions of pairwise disjoint balls $B(z,r_z)$, $z\in Z$, which have a certain separation
property with respect to a suitable measure $\lambda$ on $X$ are unavoidable if and only if, for some/any
point $x_0\in X$, the series $\sum_{z\in Z} g(\rho(x_0,z))/g(r_z) $ diverges. The results generalize
and, exploiting a zero-one law for hitting probabilities, simplify recent work by S. Gardiner and
M. Ghergu, A. Mimica and Z. Vondra\v cek, and the author.
