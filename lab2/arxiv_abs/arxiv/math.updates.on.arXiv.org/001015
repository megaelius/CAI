It is well understood that dynamic instability is among the primary drivers of forecast uncertainty
in chaotic, physical systems and a variety of data assimilation techniques are designed specifically
to exploit this phenomena. Recent mathematical work provides formal proofs of the central hypothesis
of the Assimilation in the Unstable Subspace methodology of Anna Trevisan and her collaborators:
for filters and smoothers in perfect, linear models, the distribution of forecast errors asymptotically
conforms to the unstable-neutral subspace, i.e., the column span of the error covariance aligns
with the span of backward Lyapunov vectors with non-negative exponents. While earlier mathematical
studies have focused on perfect models, this current work now formally explores the relationship
between dynamical instability, the precision of observations and the evolution of forecast error
in linear, time-varying models with additive model error. We prove upper and lower bounds for the
asymptotic uncertainty in terms of observational accuracy and the rate of dynamical expansion,
and provide a novel, necessary criteria for the boundedness of forecast errors relating these quantities.
While forecast error in the stable subspace may not vanish, we show that even without observations,
uncertainty remains uniformly bounded due its dynamical dissipation. However, the continuous
re-injection of uncertainty from model errors may be excited by transient instabilities in the
weakly stable modes of high variability, rendering forecast uncertainty impractically large.
Expanding on earlier studies, we expose the fundamental, first order effect of transient instability
in weakly stable modes on the growth of forecast uncertainty for reduced rank, sub-optimal filters.
