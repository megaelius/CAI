Bill James invented the Pythagorean expectation in the late 70's to predict a baseball team's winning
percentage knowing just their runs scored and allowed. His original formula estimates a winning
percentage of ${\rm RS}^2/({\rm RS}^2+{\rm RA}^2)$, where ${\rm RS}$ stands for runs scored and
${\rm RA}$ for runs allowed; later versions found better agreement with data by replacing the exponent
2 with numbers near 1.83. Miller and his colleagues provided a theoretical justification by modeling
runs scored and allowed by independent Weibull distributions. They showed that a single Weibull
distribution did a very good job of describing runs scored and allowed, and led to a predicted won-loss
percentage of $({\rm RS_{\rm obs}}-1/2)^\gamma / (({\rm RS_{\rm obs}}-1/2)^\gamma + ({\rm RA_{\rm
obs}}-1/2)^\gamma)$, where ${\rm RS_{\rm obs}}$ and ${\rm RA_{\rm obs}}$ are the observed runs
scored and allowed and $\gamma$ is the shape parameter of the Weibull (typically close to 1.8). We
show a linear combination of Weibulls more accurately determines a team's run production and increases
the prediction accuracy of a team's winning percentage by an average of about 25% (thus while the
currently used variants of the original predictor are accurate to about four games a season, the
new combination is accurate to about three). The new formula is more involved computationally;
however, it can be easily computed on a laptop in a matter of minutes from publicly available season
data. It performs as well (or slightly better) than the related Pythagorean formulas in use, and
has the additional advantage of having a theoretical justification for its parameter values (and
not just an optimization of parameters to minimize prediction error).
