Let us define for a compact set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ the sequence $$ A(k) = \left\{\frac{a_1+\cdots
+a_k}{k}: a_1, \ldots, a_k\in A\right\}=\frac{1}{k}\Big(\underset{k\ {\rm times}}{\underbrace{A
+ \cdots + A}}\Big). $$ It was independently proved by Shapley, Folkman and Starr (1969) and by Emerson
and Greenleaf (1969) that $A(k)$ approaches the convex hull of $A$ in the Hausdorff distance induced
by the Euclidean norm as $k$ goes to $\infty$. We explore in this survey how exactly $A(k)$ approaches
the convex hull of $A$, and more generally, how a Minkowski sum of possibly different compact sets
approaches convexity, as measured by various indices of non-convexity. The non-convexity indices
considered include the Hausdorff distance induced by any norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$, the volume deficit
(the difference of volumes), a non-convexity index introduced by Schneider (1975), and the effective
standard deviation or inner radius. After first clarifying the interrelationships between these
various indices of non-convexity, which were previously either unknown or scattered in the literature,
we show that the volume deficit of $A(k)$ does not monotonically decrease to 0 in dimension 12 or above,
thus falsifying a conjecture of Bobkov et al. (2011), even though their conjecture is proved to be
true in dimension 1 and for certain sets $A$ with special structure. On the other hand, Schneider's
index possesses a strong monotonicity property along the sequence $A(k)$, and both the Hausdorff
distance and effective standard deviation are eventually monotone (once $k$ exceeds $n$). Along
the way, we obtain new inequalities for the volume of the Minkowski sum of compact sets, falsify a
conjecture of Dyn and Farkhi (2004), demonstrate applications of our results to combinatorial
discrepancy theory, and suggest some questions worthy of further investigation.
