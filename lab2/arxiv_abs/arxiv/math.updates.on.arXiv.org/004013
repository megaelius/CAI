Motivated by the cost savings that can be obtained by sharing resources in a network context, we consider
a stylized, yet representative model, for the coordination of maintenance and service logistics
for a geographic network of assets. Capital assets, such as wind turbines in a wind park, require
maintenance throughout their long lifetimes. Two types of preventive maintenance are considered:
planned maintenance at periodic, scheduled opportunities, and opportunistic maintenance at
unscheduled opportunities. The latter type of maintenance arises due to the network context: when
an asset in the network fails, this constitutes an opportunity for preventive maintenance for the
other assets in the network. So as to increase the realism of the model at hand and its applicability
to various sectors, we consider the option of not-deferring and of deferring planned maintenance
after the occurrence of opportunistic maintenance. We also assume that preventive maintenance
may not always restore the condition of the system to `as good as new'. By formulating this problem
as a semi-Markov decision process, we characterize the optimal policy as a control limit policy
(depending on the remaining time until the next planned maintenance) that indicates on the one hand
when it is optimal to perform preventive maintenance and on the other hand when maintenance resources
should be shared if an opportunity in the network arises. In order to facilitate managerial insights
on the effect of each parameter on the cost, we provide a closed-form expression for the long-run
rate of cost for any given control limit policy (depending on the remaining time until the next planned
maintenance) and compare the costs (under the optimal policy) to these of sub-optimal policies
that neglect the opportunity for resource sharing. We illustrate our findings using data from the
wind energy industry.
