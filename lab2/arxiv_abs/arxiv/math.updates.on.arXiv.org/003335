Currently, nearly all positivity preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of
partial differential equations are coupled with explicit time integration methods. Unfortunately,
for many problems this can result in severe time-step restrictions. The techniques used to develop
explicit positivity preserving DG discretizations can, however, not easily be combined with implicit
time integration methods. In this paper we therefore present a new approach. Using Lagrange multipliers
the conditions imposed by the positivity preserving limiters are directly coupled to a DG discretization
combined with a Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta time integration method. The positivity preserving
DG discretization is then reformulated as a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) problem, which is frequently
encountered in constrained optimization. Since the limiter is only active in areas where positivity
must be enforced it does not affect the higher order DG discretization elsewhere. The resulting
non-smooth nonlinear algebraic equations have, however, a different structure compared to most
constrained optimization problems. We therefore develop an efficient active set semi-smooth
Newton method that is suitable for the KKT formulation of time-implicit positivity preserving
DG discretizations. Convergence of this semi-smooth Newton method is proven using a specially
designed quasi-directional derivative of the time-implicit positivity preserving DG discretization.
The time-implicit positivity preserving DG discretization is demonstrated for several nonlinear
scalar conservation laws, which include the advection, Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Barenblatt, and
Buckley-Leverett equations.
