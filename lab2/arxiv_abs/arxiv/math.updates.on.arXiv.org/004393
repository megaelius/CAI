Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated discrete group and let $\widetilde{M}$ be a Galois $\Gamma$-covering
of a smooth compact manifold $M$. Let $u:X\to B\Gamma$ be the associated classifying map. Finally,
let $\mathrm{S}_*^\Gamma (\widetilde{M})$ be the analytic structure group, a K-theory group
appearing in the Higson-Roe exact sequence $\cdots\to \mathrm{S}_*^\Gamma(\widetilde{M})\to
K_*(M)\to K_*(C^*\Gamma)\to\cdots$. Under suitable assumptions on $\Gamma$ we construct two
pairings, first between $\mathrm{S}^\Gamma_*(\widetilde{M})$ and the delocalized part of the
cyclic cohomology of $\mathbb{C}\Gamma$, and secondly between $\mathrm{S}^\Gamma_*(\widetilde
M)$ and the relative cohomology $H^*(M\to B\Gamma)$. Both are compatible with known pairings associated
with the other terms in the Higson-Roe sequence. In particular, we define higher rho numbers associated
to the rho class $\rho(\widetilde{D})\in \mathrm{S}_*^\Gamma (\widetilde{M})$ of an invertible
$\Gamma$-equivariant Dirac type operator on $\widetilde{M}$. Regarding the first pairing we
establish in fact a more general result, valid without additional assumptions on $\Gamma$: indeed,
we prove that it is possible to map the Higson-Roe analytic surgery sequence to the long exact sequence
in noncommutative de Rham homology $ \cdots\xrightarrow{j_*} H_{*-1} (\mathcal{A}\Gamma)\xrightarrow{\iota}
H^{del}_{*-1} (\mathcal{A}\Gamma)\xrightarrow{\delta}H^{e}_{*} (\mathcal{A}\Gamma)\xrightarrow{j_*}\cdots$
with $\mathcal{A}\Gamma$ a dense homomorphically closed subalgebra of $C^*_r \Gamma$ and $ H_{*}^{del}
(\mathcal{A}\Gamma)$ and $ H_{*}^{e} (\mathcal{A}\Gamma)$ denoting versions of the delocalized
homology and the homology localized at the identity element, respectively.
