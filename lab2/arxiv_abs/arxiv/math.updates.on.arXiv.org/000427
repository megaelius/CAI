The $n$-dimensional binary hypercube $\mathbb{Q}_n$ is the graph whose vertices are the binary
$n$-tuples $\{0, 1\}^n$ and where two vertices are connected by an edge if they differ at exactly
one coordinate. We let $\hat{0}$ and $\hat{1}$ denote the all zeroes and all ones vertices respectively.
We consider first-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Q}_n$; for each edge $e \in E\left(\mathbb{Q}_n\right)$
we assign a random weight $W_e$ according to independent exponential random variables with unit
mean, and define the first-passage time from $\hat{0}$ to $\hat{1}$ as $T_n=\min_{\gamma} \sum_{e\in\gamma}
W_e$ where $\gamma$ goes over all paths from $\hat{0}$ to $\hat{1}$ in $\mathbb{Q}_n$. In a paper
by Fill and Pemantle (1993) it was shown that, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and with probability $1-o(1)$,
$T_n$ is sandwiched between $\ln\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)-o(1) \approx 0.881$ and $1+o(1)$.
It has later been conjectured by Bollob\'{a}s and Kohayakawa that $T_n$ converges in probability.
In this article, we resolve this problem by showing that $T_n$ converges to $\ln\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)$
as $n\rightarrow\infty$. This directly improves a result by Bollob\'{a}s and Kohawakaya regarding
the covering time of $\mathbb{Q}_n$. A key idea of our proof is to consider a lower bound on Richardson's
model, closely related to the branching process used in the article by Fill and Pemantle to obtain
the bound $T_n \geq \ln\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)-o(1)$. We derive an explicit lower bound on the
probability that a vertex is infected at a given time. This result is formulated for a general graph
and may be applicable in other settings as well.
