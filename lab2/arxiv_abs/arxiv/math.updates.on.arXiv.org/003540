For any abelian category $\mathcal{A}$, Auslander constructed a localisation $w:\mathrm{fp}(\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathrm{Ab})\to
\mathcal{A}$ called the defect, which is the left adjoint to the Yoneda embedding $Y:\mathcal{A}\to\mathrm{fp}(\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathrm{Ab})$.
If $\mathcal{A}$ has enough projectives, then this localisation is part of a recollement called
the defect recollement. We show that this recollement is an instance of the MacPherson-Vilonen
construction if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ is hereditary. We also discuss several subcategories
of $\mathrm{fp}(\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{op}},\mathrm{Ab})$ which arise as canonical features
of the defect recollement, and characterise them by properties of their projective presentations
and their orthogonality with other subcategories. We apply some parts of the defect recollement
to the model theory of modules. Let $R$ be a ring and let $\phi/\psi$ be a pp-pair. When $R$ is an artin
algebra, we show that there is a smallest pp formula $\rho$ such that $\psi\leqslant\rho\leqslant\phi$
which agrees with $\phi$ on injectives, and that there is a largest pp formula $\mu$ such that $\psi\leqslant
\mu\leqslant \phi$ and $\psi R=\mu R$. When $R$ is left coherent, we show that there is a largest pp
formula $\sigma$ such that $\psi\leqslant\sigma\leqslant \phi$ which agrees with $\psi$ on injectives,
and that the pp-pair $\psi/\phi$ is isomorphic to a pp formula if and only if $\psi=\sigma$, and that
there is a smallest pp formula $\nu$ such that $\psi\leqslant \nu\leqslant\phi$ and $\phi R=\nu
R$. We also show that, for any pp-pair $\phi/\psi$, $w(\phi/\psi)\cong (D\psi)R/(D\phi)R$, where
$D$ is the elementary duality of pp formulas. We also give an expression for $w(\phi/\psi)$ in terms
of the free realisation of $\phi$ and $\psi$.
