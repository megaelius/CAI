In recent years, progress toward the classification of superintegrable systems with higher order
integrals of motion has been made. In particular, a complete classification of all exotic potentials
with a third or a fourth order integrals, and allowing separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates.
All doubly exotic potentials with a fifth order integral have also been completely classified.
It has been demonstrated how the Chazy class of third order differential equations plays an important
role in solving determining equations. Moreover, taking advantage of various operator algebras
defined as Abelian, Heisenberg, Conformal and Ladder case of operator algebras, we re-derived
these models. These new techniques also provided further examples of superintegrable Hamiltonian
with integrals of arbitrary order. It has been conjectured that all quantum superintegrable potentials
that do not satisfy any linear equation satisfy nonlinear equations having the Painlev\'e property.
In addition, it has been discovered that their integrals naturally generate finitely generated
polynomial algebras and the representations can be exploited to calculate the energy spectrum.
For certain very interesting cases associated with exceptional orthogonal polynomials, these
algebraic structures do not allow to calculate the full spectrum and degeneracies. It has been demonstrated
that alternative sets of integrals which can be build and used to provide a complete solution. This
this allow to make another conjecture i.e. that higher order superintegrable systems can be solved
algebraically, they require alternative set of integrals than the one provided by a direct approach.
