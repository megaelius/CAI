Metastable condensed matter typically fluctuates about local energy minima at the femtosecond
time scale before transitioning between local minima after nanoseconds or microseconds. This
vast scale separation limits the applicability of classical molecular dynamics methods and has
spurned the development of a host of approximate algorithms. One recently proposed method is diffusive
molecular dynamics which aims to integrate a system of ordinary differential equations describing
the likelihood of occupancy by one of two species, in the case of a binary alloy, while quasistatically
evolving the locations of the atoms. While diffusive molecular dynamics has shown to be efficient
and provide agreement with observations, it is fundamentally a model, with unclear connections
to classical molecular dynamics. In this work, we formulate a spin-diffusion stochastic process
and show how it can be connected to diffusive molecular dynamics. The spin-diffusion model couples
a classical overdamped Langevin equation to a kinetic Monte Carlo model for exchange amongst the
species of a binary alloy. Under suitable assumptions and approximations, spin-diffusion can
be shown to lead to diffusive molecular molecular dynamics type models. The key assumptions and
approximations include a well defined time scale separation, a choice of spin exchange rates, a
low temperature approximation, and a mean field type approximation. We derive several models from
different assumptions and show their relationship to diffusive molecular dynamics. Differences
and similarities amongst the models are explored in a simple test problem.
