Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are fundamental to model different phenomena in science
and engineering mathematically. Solving them is a crucial step towards a precise knowledge of the
behaviour of natural and engineered systems. In general, in order to solve PDEs that represent real
systems to an acceptable degree, analytical methods are usually not enough. One has to resort to
discretization methods. For engineering problems, probably the best known option is the finite
element method (FEM). However, powerful alternatives such as mesh-free methods and Isogeometric
Analysis (IGA) are also available. The fundamental idea is to approximate the solution of the PDE
by means of functions specifically built to have some desirable properties. In this contribution,
we explore Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as an option for approximation. They have shown impressive
results in areas such as visual recognition. DNNs are regarded here as function approximation machines.
There is great flexibility to define their structure and important advances in the architecture
and the efficiency of the algorithms to implement them make DNNs a very interesting alternative
to approximate the solution of a PDE. We concentrate in applications that have an interest for Computational
Mechanics. Most contributions that have decided to explore this possibility have adopted a collocation
strategy. In this contribution, we concentrate in mechanical problems and analyze the energetic
format of the PDE. The energy of a mechanical system seems to be the natural loss function for a machine
learning method to approach a mechanical problem. As proofs of concept, we deal with several problems
and explore the capabilities of the method for applications in engineering.
