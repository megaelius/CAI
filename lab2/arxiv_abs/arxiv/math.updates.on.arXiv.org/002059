This work is devoted to investigating the evolution of concentration in a genetic regulation system,
when the synthesis reaction rate is under additive and multiplicative asymmetric stable L\'evy
fluctuations. By focusing on the impact of skewness (i.e., non-symmetry) in the probability distributions
of noise, we find that via examining the mean first exit time (MFET) and the first escape probability
(FEP), the asymmetric fluctuations, interacting with nonlinearity in the system, lead to peculiar
likelihood for transcription. This includes, in the additive noise case, realizing higher likelihood
of transcription for larger positive skewness (i.e., asymmetry) index $\beta$, causing a stochastic
bifurcation at the non-Gaussianity index value $\alpha=1$ (i.e., it is a separating point or line
for the likelihood for transcription), and achieving a turning point at the threshold value $\beta
\approx -0.5$ (i.e., beyond which the likelihood for transcription suddenly reversed for $\alpha$
values). The stochastic bifurcation and turning point phenomena do not occur in the symmetric noise
case ($\beta =0$). While in the multiplicative noise case, non-Gaussianity index value $\alpha=1$
is a separating point or line for both the mean first exit time (MFET) and the first escape probability
(FEP). We also investigate the noise enhanced stability phenomenon. Additionally, we are able
to specify the regions in the whole parameter space for the asymmetric noise, in which we attain desired
likelihood for transcription. We have conducted a series of numerical experiments in `regulating'
the likelihood of gene transcription by tuning asymmetric stable L\'evy noise indexes. This work
offers insights for possible ways of achieving gene regulation in experimental research.
