In 2010, Gordan \v{Z}itkovi\'{c} introduced the notion of convex compactness for a convex subset
of a linear topological space and gave some important applications to both nonlinear analysis and
mathematical economics in [ Gordan \v{Z}itkovi\'{c}, Convex compactness and its applications,
Math. Finance Econom. 3(1) (2010) 1--12 ]. Motivated by Gordan \v{Z}itkovi\'{c}'s idea, in this
paper we introduce the notion of $L^0$--convex compactness for an $L^0$--convex subset of a topological
module over the topological algebra $L^0(\mathcal{F},K)$, where $L^0(\mathcal{F},K)$ is the
algebra of equivalence classes of random variables from a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$
to the scalar field $K$ of real numbers or complex numbers, endowed with the topology of convergence
in probability. This paper continues to develop the theory of $L^0$--convex compactness by establishing
various kinds of characterization theorems for $L^0$--convex subsets of a class of important topological
modules--complete random normed modules, in particular, we make use of the theory of random conjugate
spaces to give a characterization theorem of James type for a closed $L^0$--convex subset of a complete
random normed module. As applications, we successfully generalize some basic theorems of classical
convex optimization and variational inequalities from a convex function on a reflexive Banach
space to an $L^0$--convex function on a random reflexive random normed module. Since the usual weak
compactness method fails in the random setting of this paper and in particular, since the difficulties
caused by the partial order structure of the range of an $L^0$--valued function also frequently
occurs in the study of problems involved in this paper, we are forced to discover a series of new skills
to meet the needs of this paper.
