For an integer $m \geq 2$, we consider the class $\mathcal{F}_m$ of maps on the unit interval $I$ with
constant slope $\pm m$ on each subinterval of the partition $\mathcal{P}_m$ of $I$ into $m$ equal
subintervals. We investigate the effect on mixing properties when $f \in \mathcal{F}_m$ is composed
with the interval exchange map given by a permutation $\sigma \in S_N$ interchanging the $N$ subintervals
of the partition $\mathcal{P}_N$. This extends the work in a previous paper [N.P. Byott, M. Holland
and Y. Zhang, DCDS, {\bf 33}, (2013) 3365--3390], where we considered only the "stretch-and-fold"
map $f_{sf}(x)=mx \bmod 1$. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a permutation
$\sigma$ for which $\sigma \circ f$ fails to be topologically mixing. We also consider the worst
mixing rate $\tau^{(m,N)}(f)$ which occurs as $\sigma$ varies (where a mixing rate close to $1$
indicates slow mixing). We obtain the exact value of $\tau^{(m,N)}(f_{zz})$ where $f_{zz}$ is
the "zigzag" map, with the maximal number of changes of slope. We show that, for odd $m$, no $f \in \mathcal{F}_m$
can have worse asymptotic mixing behaviour than $f_{zz}$ in the following sense: there is an explicit
constant $c(m)$, depending only on $m$, such that $\liminf\limits_{N\to\infty} (1-\tau^{(m,N)}(f))/(1-\tau^{(m,N)}(f_{zz}))
\geq c(m)$ with $\gcd(m,N)=1$. When $m=2$, $f_{zz}$ is the familiar tent map. In this case, there
are always permutations $\sigma$ for which $\sigma \circ f_{zz}$ is not mixing. We give a partial
result on the worst mixing rate which occurs for the tent map when such permutations are excluded.
