I defended my PhD Thesis in Rome, Universit\`a Roma Tre, on April, 23, 2009, under the direction of
Professor Luigi Chierchia. The judging committee was composed by Professors M. Berti, A. Celletti,
C. Falcolini, J. F\'ejoz. Professors M. Berti and J. F\'ejoz refereed my thesis. The main result
of my thesis is the first direct proof (after the indirect proof given by [J. F\'ejoz, ETDS, 2004])
of a famous statement by V. I. Arnold (1963), usually referred to as "Arnold's Planetary Theorem".
My proof of Arnold's Planetary Theorem relies on the discovery, during the year 2008, of a symplectic
set of action-angle variables (described in \S 4 of my thesis) which perform explicitly the reduction
of rotation invariance of the system. In the same year 2008, I regretted to realize that my newly discovered
variables were very similar (symplectically related) to another set of symplectic variables (not
action-angle) studied by [A. Deprit, Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astr., 1983], who in turn developed ideas by
[F. Boigey, Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astr., 1982]. I realized the partial coincidence of Deprit's reduction
with my reduction after reading a paper by [Malige, Robutel, Laskar Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astr., 2002],
where Deprit's paper is mentioned. I then regularized my action-angle variables to include co-planar
and co-circular motions. This regularization leads to a set of mixed action-angle and rectangular
variables analogous to Poincar\'e' variables but better fitted to rotation invariance of the system,
since they exhibit a cyclic couple of conjugated variables. I finally applied my regularized variables
to the problem, checked non-trivial torsion and obtained the proof of the theorem. I wish to thank
J. F\'ejoz for mentioning my contribution to the proof of Arnold's Theorem, and especially my rediscovery
of Deprit's reduction, in his paper [J. Fejoz, Discrete and continuous dynamical systems, DCDS-A,
2013]
