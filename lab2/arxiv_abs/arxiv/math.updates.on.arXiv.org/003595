We propose simultaneous mean-variance regression for the linear estimation and approximation
of conditional mean functions. In the presence of heteroskedasticity of unknown form, our method
accounts for varying dispersion in the regression outcome across the support of conditioning variables
by using weights that are jointly determined with the mean regression parameters. Simultaneity
generates outcome predictions that are guaranteed to improve over ordinary least-squares prediction
error, with corresponding parameter standard errors that are automatically valid. Under shape
misspecification of the conditional mean and variance functions, we establish existence and uniqueness
of the resulting approximations and characterize their formal interpretation and robustness
properties. In particular, we show that the corresponding mean-variance regression location-scale
model weakly dominates the ordinary least-squares location model under a Kullback-Leibler measure
of divergence, with strict improvement in the presence of heteroskedasticity. The simultaneous
mean-variance regression loss function is globally convex and the corresponding estimator is
easy to implement. We establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under misspecification,
provide robust inference methods, and present numerical simulations that show large improvements
over ordinary and weighted least-squares in terms of estimation and inference in finite samples.
We further illustrate our method with two empirical applications to the estimation of the relationship
between economic prosperity in 1500 and today, and demand for gasoline in the United States.
