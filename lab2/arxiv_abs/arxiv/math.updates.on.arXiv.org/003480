We derive a system of nonlinear elliptic equations with matrix valued differential forms as unknowns,
the Regularity Transformation equations (or RT-equations), and prove that they determine whether
metrics in General Relativity (GR) can be smoothed to optimal regularity (i.e., two full derivatives
smoother than the curvature tensor) by coordinate transformation; that is, they determine whether
a coordinate transformation is sufficient to un-wrinkle a wrinkled map of spacetime. Shock-wave
solutions constructed by the Glimm scheme in GR with metric in $C^{0,1}$ are non-optimal, and it
is an open problem whether there always exist coordinate transformations which smooth such metrics
to optimal regularity $C^{1,1}$, or whether regularity singularities exist. In this paper we pose
the problem at the general level of connections $\Gamma\in W^{m,p}, {\rm Riem}(\Gamma) \in W^{m,p}$,
and prove existence of solutions of the RT-equations when $m\geq1$, $p>n$, by applying the linear
theory of elliptic regularity in $L^p$ spaces to prove convergence of an iteration scheme. The iteration
scheme then provides an explicit numerical algorithm for smoothing metrics to optimal regularity
in GR, demonstrating that no regularity singularities exist when $m\geq1$, $p>n$. The starting
point for the derivation of the RT-equations is the Riemann-flat condition, a geometric condition
for metric smoothing introduced previously by the authors. For the case of GR shock waves ($m= 0$,
$p=\infty$), the RT-equations establish a connection between regularity singularities in GR
and classical Calderon-Zygmund singularities in elliptic PDE theory.
