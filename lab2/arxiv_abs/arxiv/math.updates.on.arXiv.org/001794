Semi-tensor product(STP) or matrix (M-) product of matrices turns the set of matrices with arbitrary
dimensions into a monoid $({\cal M},\ltimes)$. A matrix (M-) addition is defined over subsets of
a partition of ${\cal M}$, and a matrix (M-) equivalence is proposed. Eventually, some quotient
spaces are obtained as vector spaces of matrices. Furthermore, a set of formal polynomials is constructed,
which makes the quotient space of $({\cal M},\ltimes)$, denoted by $(\Sigma, \ltimes)$, a vector
space and a monoid. Similarly, a vector addition (V-addition) and a vector equivalence (V-equivalence)
are defined on ${\cal V}$, the set of vectors of arbitrary dimensions. Then the quotient space of
vectors, $\Omega$, is also obtained as a vector space. The action of monoid $({\cal M},\ltimes)$
on ${\cal V}$ (or $(\Sigma, \ltimes)$ on $\Omega$) is defined as a vector (V-) product, which becomes
a pseudo-dynamic system, called the cross-dimensional linear system (CDLS). Both the discrete
time and the continuous time CDLSs have been investigated. For certain time-invariant case, the
solutions (trajectories) are presented. Furthermore, the corresponding cross-dimensional
linear control systems are also proposed and the controllability and observability are discussed.
Both M-product and V-product are generalizations of the conventional matrix product, that is,
when the dimension matching condition required by the conventional matrix product is satisfied
they coincide with the conventional matrix product. Both M-addition and V-addition are generalizations
of conventional matrix addition. Hence, the dynamics discussed in this paper is a generalization
of conventional linear system theory.
