The action principle by Low [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 248, 282--287] for the classic Vlasov-Maxwell
system contains a mix of Eulerian and Lagrangian variables. This renders the Noether analysis of
reparametrization symmetries inconvenient, especially since the well-known energy- and momentum-conservation
laws for the system are expressed in terms of Eulerian variables only. While an Euler-Poincar\'e
formulation of Vlasov-Maxwell-type systems, effectively starting with Low's action and using
constrained variations for the Eulerian description of particle motion, has been known for a while
[J. Math. Phys., 39, 6, pp. 3138-3157], it is hard to come by a documented derivation of the related
energy- and momentum-conservation laws in the spirit of the Euler-Poincar\'e machinery. To our
knowledge only one such derivation exists in the literature so far, dealing with the so-called guiding-center
Vlasov-Darwin system [Phys. Plasmas 25, 102506]. The present exposition discusses a generic class
of local Vlasov-Maxwell-type systems, with a conscious choice of adopting the language of differential
geometry to exploit the Euler-Poincar\'e framework to its full extent. After reviewing the transition
from a Lagrangian picture to an Eulerian one, we demonstrate how symmetries generated by isometries
in space lead to conservation laws for linear- and angular-momentum density and how symmetry by
time translation produces a conservation law for energy density. We also discuss what happens if
no symmetries exist. Finally, two explicit examples will be given -- the classic Vlasov-Maxwell
and the drift-kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell -- and the results expressed in the language of regular vector
calculus for familiarity.
