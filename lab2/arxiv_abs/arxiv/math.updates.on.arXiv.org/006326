Honeybees play an important role in sustaining the ecosystem. The rapid decline of their population
have sparked a great concern worldwide. Field and theoretical studies have shown that the infestation
of the parasitic Varroa mite could be one of the main reasons that lead to colony collapsing. In order
to understand how mites affect population dynamics of honeybees and the healthy status of colony,
we propose and study a brood-adultbee-mite model with time lag from brood to adult bee. Noting that
the temporal dynamics of honeybee colony varies with respect to changes in seasonality, we validate
the model and perform parameter estimations under both constant and fluctuating seasonality scenarios.
We found: (a) In the presence of parasite mites, the large time lag from brood to adult could destabilize
population dynamics and drive the colony to collapse; but the small natural mortality of adult has
the ability to promote a mite-free colony as time lag is small or at an intermediate level; (b) Small
brood's infestation rate could stabilize all populations at the unique interior equilibrium under
constant seasonality while driving the mite to die out when changes in seasonality is taken into
account; (c) Large brood's infestation rate can destabilize the dynamics leading to colony collapse
depending on initial population size under constant and non-constant seasonal model; (d) Results
from our sensitivity analysis indicate that the queen's egg-laying may have the greatest effect
on colony size. The death rate of the brood and the colony size at which brood survivability is half
maximal were also shown to be highly sensitive with an inverse correlation to the colony population
size. Our results provide the dynamics generated by seasonality where the mite population dies
out leaving healthy colony while all population goes extinct without seasonality.
