We construct quasi-periodic and almost periodic solutions for coupled Hamiltonian systems on
an infinite lattice which is translation invariant. The couplings can be long range, provided that
they decay moderately fast with respect to the distance. For the solutions we construct, most of
the sites are moving in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic fixed point, but there are oscillating sites
clustered around a sequence of nodes. The amplitude of these oscillations does not need to tend to
zero. In particular, the almost periodic solutions do not decay at infinity. We formulate an invariance
equation. Solutions of this equation are embeddings of an invariant torus on which the motion is
conjugate to a rotation. We show that, if there is an approximate solution of the invariance equation
that satisfies some non-degeneracy conditions, there is a true solution close by. The proof of this
\emph{a-posteriori} theorem is based on a Nash-Moser iteration, which does not use transformation
theory. Simpler versions of the scheme were developed in E. Fontich, R. de la Llave,Y. Sire \emph{J.
Differential. Equations.} {\bf 246}, 3136 (2009). One technical tool, important for our purposes,
is the use of weighted spaces that capture the idea that the maps under consideration are local interactions.
Using these weighted spaces, the estimates of iterative steps are similar to those in finite dimensional
spaces. In particular, the estimates are independent of the number of nodes that get excited. Using
these techniques, given two breathers, we can place them apart and obtain an approximate solution,
which leads to a true solution nearby. By repeating the process infinitely often, we can get solutions
with infinitely many frequencies which do not tend to zero at infinity.
