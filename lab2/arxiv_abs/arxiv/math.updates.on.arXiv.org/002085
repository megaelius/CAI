In classical and intuitionistic first-order logic, the "Law of Non-Contradiction" (LNC) states
that no statement is simultaneously both true and false. In logic notation, $\neg(P \land \neg P)$.
In Boolean algebra notation, $Y=\operatorname{NOT}(X\operatorname{AND}\overline{X})$,
wherein $X,\overline{X},Y\in\{0,1\}$. Riemann's analytic continuation of $\zeta(s)$ contradicts
this fundamental law of logic, because the Dirichlet series $\zeta(s)=\sum n^{-s}$ is proven divergent
at $\operatorname{Re(s)}\le1$, wherein $s\in \mathbb{C}$. In contrast, Riemann's analytic
continuation of $\zeta(s)$ claims to be convergent at all $s\in \mathbb{C}$ (except for a pole at
$s=1$). If $P$ is defined as divergence, then $\lnot P$ is convergence. Given the proven divergence
of Dirichlet series $\zeta(s)$ at $\operatorname{Re(s)}\le1$, Riemann's claim of convergence
there (except at $s=1$) corresponds to $(P \land \neg P)$, which violates the Law of Non-Contradiction.
Moreover, the derivation of Riemann's analytic continuation of $\zeta(s)$ is based on a logical
error inherited from Hankel's derivation of $\Gamma(z)$. Riemann's contour integral of $\zeta(s)$
comprises $\log(-z)$, wherein $z\in \mathbb{C}$ and the domain of the contour integral is the branch
cut of $\log(-z)$. As in Hankel's derivation of $\Gamma(z)$, a corollary of the Cauchy integral
theorem is used to equate this undefined contour integral to the contour integral over a domain that
is a "Hankel-type" contour that surrounds the branch cut. But both the branch cut and the "Hankel-type"
contour contradict the prerequisites of the Cauchy integral theorem. So the Cauchy integral theorem
cannot equate the two contours, and thus Riemann's analytic continuation of $\zeta(s)$ is not valid.
