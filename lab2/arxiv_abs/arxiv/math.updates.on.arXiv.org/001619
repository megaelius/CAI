Many physical problems can be cast in a form where a constitutive equation ${\bf J(x)}={\bf L(x)E(x)}+{\bf
h(x)}$ with a source term ${\bf h(x)}$ holds for all ${\bf x}\in R^d$ and relates fields ${\bf E}$
and ${\bf J}$ that satisfy appropriate differential constraints, symbolized by ${\bf E\in\cal
E}$ and ${\bf J}\in\cal J$ where $\cal E$ and $\cal J$ are orthogonal spaces that span the space $\cal
H$ of square-integrable fields in which ${\bf h}$ lies. Here we show that if the moduli ${\bf L(x)}$
are constrained to take values in certain nonlinear manifolds $\cal M$, and satisfy suitable coercivity
and boundedness conditions, then the infinite body Green's function for the problem satisfies
certain exact identities. A corollary of our theory is that it also provides the framework for establishing
links between the Green's functions for different physical problems, sharing some commonality
in their geometry. The analysis is based on the theory of exact relations for composites, but, unlike
in the theory of composites, we make no assumptions about the length scales of variations in the moduli
${\bf L(x)}$. For bodies $\Omega$ of finite extent, such that ${\bf L(x)}\in{\cal M}$ for ${\bf
x}\in\Omega$, the exact relations for the infinite body Green's function imply that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
map (DtN-map) characterizing the response of the body also satisfies exact relations. These exact
relations can be viewed as boundary field equalities that generalize the notion of conservation
laws: the field inside the body satisfies certain constraints, that still leave a wide choice in
these fields, but which enable one to deduce identities satisfied by the fields at the boundary.
The extension of our results to certain non-linear minimization problems is also sketched.
