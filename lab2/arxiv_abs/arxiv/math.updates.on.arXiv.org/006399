This work considers the sample and computational complexity of obtaining an $\epsilon$-optimal
policy in a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP), given only access to a generative model. In
this work, we study the effectiveness of the most natural plug-in approach to model-based planning:
we build the maximum likelihood estimate of the transition model in the MDP from observations and
then find an optimal policy in this empirical MDP. We ask arguably the most basic and unresolved question
in model based planning: is the naive "plug-in" approach, non-asymptotically, minimax optimal
in the quality of the policy it finds, given a fixed sample size? Here, the non-asymptotic regime
refers to when the sample size is sublinear in the model size. With access to a generative model, we
resolve this question in the strongest possible sense: our main result shows that \emph{any} high
accuracy solution in the plug-in model constructed with $N$ samples, provides an $\epsilon$-optimal
policy in the true underlying MDP (where $\epsilon$ is the minimax accuracy with $N$ samples at every
state, action pair). In comparison, all prior (non-asymptotically) minimax optimal results use
model free approaches, such as the Variance Reduced Q-value iteration algorithm (Sidford et al
2018), while the best known model-based results (e.g. Azar et al 2013) require larger sample sizes
in their dependence on the planning horizon or the state space. Notably, we show that the model-based
approach allows the use of \emph{any} efficient planning algorithm in the empirical MDP, which
simplifies algorithm design as this approach does not tie the algorithm to the sampling procedure.
The core of our analysis is avnovel "absorbing MDP" construction to address the statistical dependency
issues that arise in the analysis of model-based planning approaches, a construction which may
be helpful more generally.
