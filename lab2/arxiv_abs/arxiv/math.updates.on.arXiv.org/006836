This paper sets up the foundations for derived algebraic geometry, Goerss--Hopkins obstruction
theory, and the construction of commutative ring spectra in the abstract setting of operadic algebras
in symmetric spectra in an (essentially) arbitrary model category. We show that one can do derived
algebraic geometry a la To\"en--Vezzosi in an abstract category of spectra. We also answer in the
affirmative a question of Goerss and Hopkins by showing that the obstruction theory for operadic
algebras in spectra can be done in the generality of spectra in an (essentially) arbitrary model
category. We construct strictly commutative simplicial ring spectra representing a given cohomology
theory and illustrate this with a strictly commutative motivic ring spectrum representing higher
order products on Deligne cohomology. These results are obtained by first establishing Smith's
stable positive model structure for abstract spectra and then showing that this category of spectra
possesses excellent model-theoretic properties: we show that all colored symmetric operads in
symmetric spectra valued in a symmetric monoidal model category are admissible, i.e., algebras
over such operads carry a model structure. This generalizes the known model structures on commutative
ring spectra and E-infinity ring spectra in simplicial sets or motivic spaces. We also show that
any weak equivalence of operads in spectra gives rise to a Quillen equivalence of their categories
of algebras. For example, this extends the familiar strictification of E-infinity rings to commutative
rings in a broad class of spectra, including motivic spectra. We finally show that operadic algebras
in Quillen equivalent categories of spectra are again Quillen equivalent.
