The engineering vision of relying on the ``smart sky" for supporting air traffic and the ``Internet
above the clouds" for in-flight entertainment has become imperative for the future aircraft industry.
Aeronautical ad hoc Networking (AANET) constitutes a compelling concept for providing broadband
communications above clouds by extending the coverage of Air-to-Ground (A2G) networks to oceanic
and remote airspace via autonomous and self-configured wireless networking amongst commercial
passenger airplanes. The AANET concept may be viewed as a new member of the family of Mobile ad hoc
Networks (MANETs) in action above the clouds. However, AANETs have more dynamic topologies, larger
and more variable geographical network size, stricter security requirements and more hostile
transmission conditions. These specific characteristics lead to more grave challenges in aircraft
mobility modeling, aeronautical channel modeling and interference mitigation as well as in network
scheduling and routing. This paper provides an overview of AANET solutions by characterizing the
associated scenarios, requirements and challenges. Explicitly, the research addressing the
key techniques of AANETs, such as their mobility models, network scheduling and routing, security
and interference are reviewed. Furthermore, we also identify the remaining challenges associated
with developing AANETs and present their prospective solutions as well as open issues. The design
framework of AANETs and the key technical issues are investigated along with some recent research
results. Furthermore, a range of performance metrics optimized in designing AANETs and a number
of representative multi-objective optimization algorithms are outlined.
