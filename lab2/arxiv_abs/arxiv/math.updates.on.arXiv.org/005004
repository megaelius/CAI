In this paper we study various aspects of porosities for conformal fractals. We first explore porosity
in the general context of infinite graph directed Markov systems (GDMS), and we show that, under
some natural assumptions, their limit sets are porous in large (in the sense of category and dimension)
subsets, and they are mean porous almost everywhere. On the other hand, we prove that if the limit
set of a GDMS is not porous then it is not porous almost everywhere. We also revisit porosity for finite
graph directed Markov systems, and we provide checkable criteria which guarantee that limit sets
have holes of relative size at every scale in a prescribed direction. We then narrow our focus to systems
associated to complex continued fractions with arbitrary alphabet and we provide a novel characterization
of porosity for their limit sets. Moreover, we introduce the notions of upper density and upper box
dimension for subsets of Gaussian integers and we explore their connections to porosity. As applications
we show that limit sets of complex continued fractions system whose alphabet is co-finite, or even
a co-finite subset of the Gaussian primes, are not porous almost everywhere, while they are mean
porous almost everywhere. We finally turn our attention to complex dynamics and we delve into porosity
for Julia sets of meromorphic functions. We show that if the Julia set of a tame meromorphic function
is not the whole complex plane then it is porous at a dense set of its points and it is almost everywhere
mean porous with respect to natural ergodic measures. On the other hand, if the Julia set is not porous
then it is not porous almost everywhere. In particular, if the function is elliptic we show that its
Julia set is not porous at a dense set of its points.
