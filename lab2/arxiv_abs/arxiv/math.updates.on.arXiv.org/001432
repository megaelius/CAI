We survey the theory of Poisson traces (or zeroth Poisson homology) developed by the authors in a
series of recent papers. The goal is to understand this subtle invariant of (singular) Poisson varieties,
conditions for it to be finite-dimensional, its relationship to the geometry and topology of symplectic
resolutions, and its applications to quantizations. The main technique is the study of a canonical
D-module on the variety. In the case the variety has finitely many symplectic leaves (such as for
symplectic singularities and Hamiltonian reductions of symplectic vector spaces by reductive
groups), the D-module is holonomic, and hence the space of Poisson traces is finite-dimensional.
As an application, there are finitely many irreducible finite-dimensional representations of
every quantization of the variety. Conjecturally, the D-module is the pushforward of the canonical
D-module under every symplectic resolution of singularities, which implies that the space of Poisson
traces is dual to the top cohomology of the resolution. We explain many examples where the conjecture
is proved, such as symmetric powers of du Val singularities and symplectic surfaces and Slodowy
slices in the nilpotent cone of a semisimple Lie algebra. We compute the D-module in the case of surfaces
with isolated singularities, and show it is not always semisimple. We also explain generalizations
to arbitrary Lie algebras of vector fields, connections to the Bernstein-Sato polynomial, relations
to two-variable special polynomials such as Kostka polynomials and Tutte polynomials, and a conjectural
relationship with deformations of symplectic resolutions. In the appendix we give a brief recollection
of the theory of D-modules on singular varieties that we require.
