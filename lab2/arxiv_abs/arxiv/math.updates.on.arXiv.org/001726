We enlarge the category of smooth maps of (super)manifolds by introducing a notion of 'microformal
morphism', starting from the classical notion of canonical relation and using formal power expansions
in the cotangent directions. The result is a formal category; that is, the composition law for microformal
morphisms is defined as a formal power series. Microformal morphisms act on functions by pullbacks
which are in general nonlinear transformations. More precisely, they are formal mappings of formal
manifolds of even functions ("bosonic fields") with the property that their derivatives at each
point are algebra homomorphisms. This suggests an abstract notion of a "nonlinear homomorphism"
of algebras and the corresponding extension of the classic algebra/geometry duality. There is
a parallel "fermionic" version of these constructions. Using this formalism, we obtain a general
construction of $L_{\infty}$-morphisms for functions on homotopy Poisson ($P_{\infty}$) or
homotopy Schouten ($S_{\infty}$) manifolds, which generalizes pullbacks by Poisson maps. Further,
we show that the familiar adjoint of a linear operator on vector spaces or vector bundles can be generalized
to nonlinear operators as a microformal morphism. We apply this to $L_{\infty}$-algebroids and
show that an $L_{\infty}$-morphism of $L_{\infty}$-algebroids induces an $L_{\infty}$-morphism
of the homotopy Lie-Poisson algebras of functions on the dual vector bundles. We apply that to higher
Koszul brackets on forms and triangular $L_{\infty}$-bialgebroids. We also obtain a quantum version
(for the bosonic case) related with the above as the Schr\"odinger equation is related with the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. We show that nonlinear pullbacks by microformal morphisms are the limits when $\hbar\to
0$ of "quantum pullbacks", which are Fourier integral operators of special type.
