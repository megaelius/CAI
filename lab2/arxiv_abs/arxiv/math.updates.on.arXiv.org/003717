Contact algebra is one of the main tools in the region-based theory of space. It is an extension of
Boolean algebra with a relation called contact. The elements of the Boolean algebra are considered
as formal representations of physical bodies. The contact relation is used also to define some other
important mereotopological relations like non-tangential inclusion, dual contact, external
contact. Most of these definitions are given by means of the operation of Boolean complementation.
There are, however, some problems related to the motivation of this operation. In order to avoid
these problems we propose a generalization of the notion of contact algebra by dropping the operation
of complement. In this paper we consider as non-definable primitives the relations of contact,
nontangential inclusion and dual contact. Part I of the paper is devoted to a suitable axiomatization
called extended distributive contact lattice (EDCL) by means of universal first-order axioms
true in all contact algebras. EDCL may be considered also as an algebraic tool for certain subarea
of mereotopology, called in this paper distributive mereotopology. The main result of Part I of
the paper is a representation theorem, stating that each EDCL can be embedded into a contact algebra,
showing in this way that the presented axiomatization preserves the meaning of mereotopological
relations without considering Boolean complementation. Part II of the paper is devoted to topological
representation theory of EDCL, transferring into the distributive case important results from
the topological representation theory of contact algebras. It is shown that under minor additional
assumptions on distributive lattices as extensionality of the definable relations of overlap
or underlap one can preserve the good topological interpretations of regions as regular closed
or regular open sets in topological space.
