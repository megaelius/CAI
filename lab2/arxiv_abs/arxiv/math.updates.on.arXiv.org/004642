The classification of Fatou components for rational functions was concluded with Sullivan's proof
of the No Wandering Domains Theorem in 1985. In 2016 it was shown, in joint work of the first and last
author with Buff, Dujardin and Raissy, that wandering domains do exist in higher dimensions. In
fact, wandering domains arise even for a seemingly simple class of maps: polynomial skew products.
While the construction gives an infinite dimensional class of examples, and has been extended to
polynomial automorphisms of $\mathbb C^4$ by Hahn and the last author, the currently known wandering
domains are essentially unique. Our goal in this paper is to construct a second example, arising
from similar techniques, but with distinctly different dynamical behavior. Instead of wandering
domains arising from a Lavaurs map with an attracting fixed point, we construct a domain arising
from a Lavaurs map with a fixed point of Siegel type. Siegel disks are not robust under perturbations,
as opposed to attracting fixed points. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence
of a so-called trapping domain for non-autonomous dynamical systems given by sequences of maps
converging parabolically towards a Siegel type limit map. Guaranteeing that this condition is
satisfied in our current construction requires a reconsideration of the proof of the original wandering
domain, as more precise estimates on the rate of convergence towards the Lavaurs map are required.
By adapting ideas introduced recently by Bedford, Smillie and Ueda, and by proving the existence
of parabolic curves, with control on their domains of definition, we prove that the convergence
rate is parabolic.
