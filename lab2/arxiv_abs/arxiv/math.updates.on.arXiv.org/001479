A conjecture by Buzzard and Gee says that the reductions modulo $p$ of certain crystabelline representations
are irreducible if their (re-normalized) slopes are not integers. The motivation behind it is to
provide local evidence supporting Coleman and Mazur's halo conjecture, which says that the (re-normalized)
slopes of overconvergent eigenforms lying over the boundary of weight space are in a disjoint union
of arithmetic progressions of rational numbers. We prove the former conjecture for slopes up to
$\smash{\tfrac{p-1}2}$ outside of a small exceptional region, and we show that this exceptional
region contains counterexamples to the conjecture (i.e. residually reducible representations).
Since extensive computational evidence (by Buzzard) and all currently known results (by Buzzard,
Kilford, McMurdy, and Roe) seem to suggest that the slopes on the residually reducible part of the
eigencurve over the boundary of weight space are actually integers, we suspect that the eigenvalues
of $U_p$ avoid this exceptional region, which is surprising. Thus, on one hand, the main result in
this paper implies that the local situation is more complicated than the global situation and that
an optimal global result is unlikely to be proven locally. On the other hand, the slopes in the exceptional
region are all half-integers, so the main result in this paper proves (locally) that the slopes on
the residually reducible part of the eigencurve over the boundary of weight space are half-integers
up to a certain point; moreover, we suspect that the exceptional region consists only of half-integer
slopes even past that point, so that a proof of a revised version of the local conjecture would provide
evidence supporting the halo conjecture just the same.
