A perfect cuboid (PC) is a rectangular parallelepiped with rational sides $a$}, {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont
$b$}, {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont $c$} whose face diagonals {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont
$d_{ab}$}, {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont $d_{bc}$}, {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont
$d_{ac}$} and space (body) diagonal {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont $d_s$} are rationals.
The existence or otherwise of PC is a problem known since at least the time of Leonhard Euler. This
research establishes equivalent conditions of PC by nontrivial rational solutions {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont
$(X,Y)$} and {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont $(Z,W)$} of congruent number equation \vskip+0.01cm
{\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont $$ y^2=x^3-N^2x, $$} \vskip+0.01cm \noindent where product
{\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont $XZ$} is a square. By using such pair of solutions five parametrizations
of nearly-perfect cuboid (NPC) (only one face diagonal is irrational) and five equivalent conditions
for PC were found. Each parametrization gives all possible NPC. For example, by using one of them
-- invariant parametrization for sides and diagonals of NPC are obtained: \vskip+0.01cm {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont
\begin{gather*} a=2XZN, \;\;\; b=|YW|, \;\;\; c=|X-Z|\sqrt{XZ}\,N, [0.2cm] d_{bc}=|XZ-N^2|\sqrt{XZ},
\;\;\; d_{ac}=|X+Z|\sqrt{XZ}\,N,[0.2cm] d_s=(XZ+N^2)\sqrt{XZ}\,; \end{gather*}} \vskip+0.01cm
\noindent and condition of the existence of PC is the rationality of \vskip+0.01cm {\fontsize{14}{16pt}\selectfont
$$ d_{ab}=\sqrt{Y^2W^2+4N^2X^2Z^2}\,. $$} %\vskip+0.01cm Because each parametrization is
complete, inverse problem is discussed. For given NPC is found corresponding congruent number
equation (i.e. congruent number) and its solutions.
