The Tutte polynomial is originally a bivariate polynomial associated to a graph in order to enumerate
the colorings of this graph and of its dual graph at the same time. However the Tutte polynomial reveals
more of the internal structure of a graph, like its number of forests and number of spanning subgraphs,
and contains even other specializations from other sciences like the Jones polynomial in Knot theory,
the partition function of the Pott model in statistical physics, and the reliability polynomial
in network theory. In 2007, Ardila defined the Tutte polynomial on more general objects which are
the real hyperplane arrangements. Computing the Tutte polynomial of a graph is indeed equivalent
to computing the Tutte polynomial of its graphic hyperplane arrangement. He computed the Tutte
polynomials of the hyperplane arrangements associated to the classical Weyl groups at the same
time. De Concini and Procesi completed his results by computing the Tutte polynomials of the hyperplane
arrangements associated to the exceptional Weyl groups one year later. At the beginning of 2017,
Randriamaro introduced a wider class of hyperplane arrangements in the Euclidean spaces called
symmetric hyperplane arrangements. He computed the Tutte polynomial of a symmetric hyperplane
arrangement, which permits to deduce the Tutte polynomials of particular hyperplane arrangements
like the Catalan, the Shi threshold, and the $\mathcal{I}_n$ arrangements. In this article, we
propose to extend the investigation to the complex hyperplane arrangements. We compute the Tutte
polynomial of a symmetric hyperplane arrangement in a Hermitian space. We particularly dedicate
a section to the special subclass of colored symmetric hyperplane arrangements. From their Tutte
polynomials, we deduce the Tutte polynomials of the hyperplane arrangements associated to the
imprimitive reflection groups.
