In this paper we address a long-standing problem of computing robust regions of attraction for state-constrained
perturbed discrete-time polynomial systems. The robust region of attraction of interest is a set
of states such that every possible trajectory initialized in it will approach an equilibrium state
while never violating the specified state constraint, regardless of the actual perturbation.
The most important contribution of this work is to characterize the interior of the maximal robust
region of attraction as the strict one sub-level set of the unique bounded and continuous solution
to a Bellman equation. The uniqueness property of the bounded and continuous solution facilitates
the use of existing numerical methods such as classical value iteration methods to solve the Bellman
equation for an appropriate number of state variables in order to obtain an approximation of the
maximal robust region of attraction. Furthermore, we propose a semi-definite programming based
method to compute robust regions of attraction such that a robust region of attraction could be obtained
by solving a single semi-definite program, rendering this method simple to implement. Under appropriate
assumptions, the existence of solutions to the constructed semi-definite program is guaranteed
and there exists a sequence of solutions such that their strict one sub-level sets inner-approximate
the interior of the maximal robust region of attraction in measure. Finally, these two numerical
approaches, i.e. the value iteration method and the semi-definite programming based method, are
evaluated and compared on two illustrative examples.
