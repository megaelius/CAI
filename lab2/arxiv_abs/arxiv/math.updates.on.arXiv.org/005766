We show that the Lorentzian Snyder models, together with their non-relativistic ($c\to\infty$)
and ultra-relativistic ($c\to0$) limiting cases, can be rigorously constructed through the projective
geometry description of Lorentzian, Galilean and Carrollian spaces with nonvanishing constant
curvature. The projective coordinates of these spaces take the role of momenta, while translation
generators over the same spaces are identified with noncommutative spacetime coordinates. In
this way, one obtains a deformed phase space algebra, which fully characterizes the Snyder model
and is invariant under boosts and rotations of the relevant kinematical symmetries. While the momentum
space of the Lorentzian Snyder models is given by certain projective coordinates on (Anti-) de Sitter
spaces, we discover that the momentum space of the Galilean (Carrollian) Snyder models is given
by certain projective coordinates on curved Carroll (Newton--Hooke) spaces. This exchange between
the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits emerging in the transition from the geometric
picture to the phase space picture is traced back to an interchange of the role of coordinates and
translation operators. As a physically relevant feature, we find that in Galilean Snyder spacetimes
the time coordinate does not commute with space coordinates, in contrast with previous proposals
for non-relativistic Snyder models, which assume that time and space decouple in the non-relativistic
limit. This remnant mixing between space and time in the non-relativistic limit is a quite general
Planck-scale effect found in several quantum spacetime models.
