We address the problem of calculating the correlation functions of one-dimensional two-component
gases with strong repulsive contact interactions. The model considered in this paper describes
particles with fractional statistics and in appropriate limits reduces to the Gaudin-Yang model
or the spinor Bose gas. In the case of impenetrable particles we derive a Fredholm determinant representation
for the temperature-, time-, and space-dependent correlation functions which is very easy to implement
numerically and constitute the starting point for the analytical investigation of the asymptotics.
Making use of this determinant representation and the solution of an associated Riemann-Hilbert
problem we derive the low-energy asymptotics of the correlators in the spin-incoherent regime
characterized by near ground-state charge degrees of freedom but a highly thermally disordered
spin sector. The asymptotics present features reminiscent of spin-charge separation with the
spin part exponentially decaying in space separation and oscillating with a period proportional
to the statistics parameter while the charge part presents scaling with anomalous exponents which
cannot be described by any unitary conformal field theory. The momentum distribution and the Fourier
transform of the dynamical Green's function are asymmetrical for arbitrary statistics, a direct
consequence of the broken space-reversal symmetry. Due to the exponential decay the momentum distribution
$n(k)$ at zero temperature does not present algebraic singularities but the tails obey the universal
decay $\lim_{k\rightarrow\pm\infty}n(k)\sim C/k^4$ with the amplitude $C$ given by Tan's contact.
As a function of the statistics parameter the contact is a monotonic function reaching its minimum
for the fermionic system and the maximum for the bosonic system.
