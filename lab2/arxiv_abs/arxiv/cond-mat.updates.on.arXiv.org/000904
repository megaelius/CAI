We present a theoretical description and numerical simulations of the superconducting transition
in hybrid structures including strong spin-orbit interactions. The spin-orbit coupling is taken
to be of Rashba type for concreteness, and we allow for an arbitrary magnitude of the spin-orbit strength
as well as an arbitrary thickness of the spin-orbit coupled layer. This allows us to make contact
with the experimentally relevant case of enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling via atomically
thin heavy metal layers. We first consider interfacial spin-orbit coupling induced by inversion
asymmetry between a ferromagnet and a superconductor. In the absence of an exchange field, we find
that the influence of the spin-orbit coupling is similar to that of a potential barrier. With a non-zero
exchange field in the ferromagnetic region, both the pair amplitude, local density of states and
critical temperature show dependency on the strength and, importantly, the orientation of the
exchange field. In general, spin-orbit coupling increases the critical temperature of the system,
and enhances the superconducting gap in the density of states. We also present results for the same
observable quantities for in-plane spin-orbit coupling in the ferromagnetic region of an S/F/S-
and an S/F-structure. The results are similar to interfacial spin-orbit coupling, although the
effect is in general stronger. Additionally, this type of spin-orbit coupling leaves no spin-rotational
symmetry, giving rise to a stronger anisotropy in the dependence of the exchange field direction.
Our results suggest that spin-orbit coupled superconducting structures may serve as substitutes
for superconductor-ferromagnet multilayer structures, allowing for a different route to exert
spin-control over the superconducting state.
