In the last 60 years conventional solid and electrolyte gating allowed sizable modulations of the
surface carrier concentration in metallic superconductors resulting in tuning their conductivity
and changing their critical temperature. Recent conventional gating experiments on superconducting
metal nano-structures showed full suppression of the critical current without variations of the
normal state resistance and the critical temperature. These results still miss a microscopic explanation.
In this article, we show a complete set of gating experiments on Ti-based superconducting Dayem
bridges and a suggested classical thermodynamic model which seems to account for several of our
experimental findings. In particular, zero-bias resistance and critical current IC measurements
highlight the following: the suppression of IC with both polarities of gate voltage, the surface
nature of the effect, the critical temperature independence from the electric field and the gate-induced
growth of a sub-gap dissipative component. In addition, the temperature dependence of the Josephson
critical current seems to show the transition from the ballistic Kulik-Omelyanchuck behavior
to the Ambegaokar-Baratoff tunnel-like characteristic by increasing the electric field. Furthermore,
the IC suppression persists in the presence of sizeable perpendicular-to-plane magnetic fields.
We propose a classical thermodynamic model able to describe some of the experimental observations
of the present and previous works. Above all, the model grabs the bipolar electric field induced
suppression of IC and the emergence of a sub-gap dissipative component near full suppression of
the supercurrent. Finally, applications employing the discussed effect are proposed.
