By means of the Jastrow correlated antisymmetrized geminal power (JAGP) wave function and quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, we study the ground state properties of the oligoacene series, up to the
nonacene. The JAGP is the accurate variational realization of the resonating-valence-bond (RVB)
ansatz proposed by Pauling and Wheland to describe aromatic compounds. We show that the long-ranged
RVB correlations built in the acenes' ground state are detrimental for the occurrence of open-shell
diradical or polyradical instabilities, previously found by lower-level theories. We substantiate
our outcome by a direct comparison with another wave function, tailored to be an open-shell singlet
(OSS) for long-enough acenes. By comparing on the same footing the RVB and OSS wave functions, both
optimized at a variational QMC level, and further projected by the lattice regularized diffusion
Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, we prove that the RVB wave function has always a lower variational energy
and better nodes than the OSS, for all molecular species considered in this work. The entangled multi-reference
RVB state acts against the electron edge localization implied by the OSS wave function, and weakens
the diradical tendency for higher oligoacenes. These properties are reflected by several descriptors,
including wave function parameters, bond length alternation, aromatic indices, and spin-spin
correlation functions. In this context, we propose a new aromatic index estimator suitable for
geminal wave functions. For the largest acenes taken into account, the long-range decay of the charge-charge
correlation functions is compatible with a quasi-metallic behavior.
