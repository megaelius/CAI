Historically, comprehensive studies of dilute ferromagnetic semiconductors, e.g., $p$-type
(Cd,Mn)Te and (Ga,Mn)As, paved the way for a quantitative theoretical description of effects associated
with spin-orbit interactions in solids, such as crystalline magnetic anisotropy. In particular,
the theory was successful in explaining {\em uniaxial} magnetic anisotropies associated with
biaxial strain and non-random formation of magnetic dimers in epitaxial (Ga,Mn)As layers. However,
the situation appears much less settled in the case of the {\em cubic} term: the theory predicts switchings
of the easy axis between in-plane $\langle 100\rangle$ and $\langle 110\rangle$ directions as
a function of the hole concentration, whereas only the $\langle 100\rangle$ orientation has been
found experimentally. Here, we report on the observation of such switchings by magnetization and
ferromagnetic resonance studies on a series of high-crystalline quality (Ga,Mn)As films. We describe
our findings by the mean-field $p$-$d$ Zener model augmented with three new ingredients. The first
one is a scattering broadening of the hole density of states, which reduces significantly the amplitude
of the alternating carrier-induced contribution. This opens the way for the two other ingredients,
namely the so-far disregarded single-ion magnetic anisotropy and disorder-driven non-uniformities
of the carrier density, both favoring the $\langle 100\rangle$ direction of the apparent easy axis.
However, according to our results, when the disorder gets reduced a switching to the $\langle 110\rangle$
orientation is possible in a certain temperature and hole concentration range.
