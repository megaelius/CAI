A liquid in contact with a textured surface can be found in two states, Wenzel and Cassie. In the Wenzel
state the liquid completely wets the corrugations while in the Cassie state the liquid is suspended
over the corrugations with air or vapor trapped below. The superhydrophobic properties of the Cassie
state are exploited for self-cleaning, drug delivery etc., while in the Wenzel state most of these
properties are lost; it is therefore of fundamental and technological interest to investigate
the kinetics and mechanism of the Cassie-Wenzel transition. Computationally, the Cassie-Wenzel
transition is often investigated using enhanced sampling techniques based on the use of collective
variables (CVs). The choice of the CVs is a crucial task because it affects the free-energy profile,
the estimation of the free-energy barriers, and the evaluation of the mechanism of the process.
Here we investigate possible simulation artifacts introduced by common CVs adopted for the study
of the Cassie-Wenzel transition: the average particle density in the corrugation of a textured
surface and the coarse grained density field at various levels of coarse graining. We also investigate
possible additional artifacts associated to finite size effects. We focus on a pillared surface.
We show that the use of the average density of fluid in the interpillar region brings to severe artifacts
in the relative Cassie-Wenzel stability and in the transition barrier. A proper description of
the wetting mechanism and its energetics requires a rather fine discretization of the density field.
Concerning the finite size effects, we have found that the typical system employed in the Cassie-Wenzel
transition, containing a single pillar within periodic boundary conditions, prevents the break
of translational symmetry of the liquid-vapor meniscus during the process.
