Low-temperature magnetization curves and thermodynamics of a frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg
triangular bilayer with the antiferromagnetic intradimer interaction and either ferromagnetic
or antiferromagnetic interdimer interaction are investigated in a highly frustrated parameter
region, where localized many-magnon eigenstates provide the most dominant contribution to magnetothermodynamics.
Low-energy states of the highly frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg triangular bilayer can be accordingly
found from a mapping correspondence with an effective triangular-lattice spin-1/2 Ising model
in a field. A description based on the effective Ising model implies that the frustrated Heisenberg
triangular bilayer with the ferromagnetic interdimer coupling displays in a zero-temperature
magnetization curve discontinuous magnetization jump, which is reduced upon increasing of temperature
until a continuous field-driven phase transition from the Ising universality class is reached
at a certain critical temperature. The frustrated Heisenberg triangular bilayer with the antiferromagnetic
interdimer coupling contrarily exhibits multistep magnetization curve with intermediate plateaus
at one-third and two-thirds of the saturation magnetization, whereas discontinuous magnetization
jumps observable at zero temperature change to continuous field-driven phase transitions from
the universality class of three-state Potts model at sufficiently low temperatures. Exact results
and Monte Carlo simulations of the effective Ising model are confronted with full exact diagonalization
data for the Heisenberg triangular bilayer in order to corroborate these findings.
