In this study we report on the results from emission $^{57}$Fe M${\"o}$ssbauer Spectroscopy experiments,
using dilute $^{57}$Mn implantation into pristine (TiO$_2$) and hydrogenated anatase held at
temperatures between 300-700 K. Results of the electronic structure and local environment are
complemented with ab-initio calculations. Upon implantation both Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ are
observed in pristine anatase, where the latter demonstrates the spin-lattice relaxation. The
spectra obtained for hydrogenated anatase show no Fe$^{3+}$ contribution, suggesting that hydrogen
acts as a donor. Due to the low threshold, hydrogen diffuses out of the lattice. Thus showing a dynamic
behavior on the time scale of the $^{57}$Fe 14.4 keV state. The surrounding oxygen vacancies favor
the high-spin Fe$^{2+}$ state. The sample treated at room temperature shows two distinct processes
of hydrogen motion. The motion commences with the interstitial hydrogen, followed by switching
to the covalently bound state. Hydrogen out-diffusion is hindered by bulk defects, which could
cause both processes to overlap. Supplementary UV-Vis and electrical conductivity measurements
show an improved electrical conductivity and higher optical absorption after the hydrogenation.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at room temperature reveals that the sample hydrogenated at
573 K shows presence of both Ti$^{3+}$ and Ti$^{2+}$ states. This could imply that a significant
amount of oxygen vacancies and -OH bonds are present in the samples. Theory suggests that in the anatase
sample implanted with Mn(Fe), probes were located near equatorial vacancies as next-nearest-neighbours,
whilst a metastable hydrogen configuration is responsible for the annealing behavior.
