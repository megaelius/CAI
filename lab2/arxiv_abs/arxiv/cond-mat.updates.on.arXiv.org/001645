The compounds BaDy$_2$O$_4$ and BaHo$_2$O$_4$ are part of a family of frustrated systems exhibiting
interesting properties, including spin liquid-type ground states, magnetic field-induced phases,
and the coexistence of short- and long-range magnetic orders, with dominant one-dimensional correlations,
which can be described as Ising $J_1-J_2$ zigzag chains along the $c$-axis. We have investigated
polycrystalline samples of BaDy$_2$O$_4$ and BaHo$_2$O$_4$ with both neutron diffraction and
neutron spectroscopy, coupled to detailed crystalline electric field calculations. The latter
points to site-dependent anisotropic magnetism in both materials, which is corroborated by the
magnetic structures we determined. The two systems show the coexistence of two different long-range
orders --- two double N\'eel $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ orders in the $ab$-plane
with propagation vectors $\mathbf{k}_1$ = ($\frac{1}{2}$,0,$\frac{1}{2}$) and $\mathbf{k}_2$
= ($\frac{1}{2}$,$\frac{1}{2}$,$\frac{1}{2}$) for BaDy$_2$O$_4$, and two distinct arrangements
of simple N\'eel $\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\downarrow$ orders along the $c$-axis, both with
the propagation vector $\mathbf{k}_0$ = (0,0,0) for BaHo$_2$O$_4$. The order for both wave vectors
in BaDy$_2$O$_4$ occurs at $T_\mathrm{N}$ = 0.48 K, while in BaHo$_2$O$_4$, the first order sets
in at $T_\mathrm{N}\sim$ 1.3 K and the second one has a lower ordering temperature of 0.84 K. Both
compounds show extensive diffuse scattering which we successfully modeled with a one-dimensional
axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model. In both materials, strong diffusive scattering
persists to temperatures well below where the magnetic order is fully saturated. The ANNNI model
fits indicate the presence of sites which do not order with moments in the $ab$-plane.
