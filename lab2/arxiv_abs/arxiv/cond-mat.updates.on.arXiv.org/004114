Structural glasses formed by quenching a melt possess a population of soft quasilocalized excitations
--- often called `soft spots' --- that are believed to play a key role in various thermodynamic, transport
and mechanical phenomena. Under a narrow set of circumstances, quasilocalized excitations assume
the form of vibrational (normal) modes, that are readily obtained by a harmonic analysis of the multi-dimensional
potential energy. In general, however, direct access to the population of quasilocalized modes
via harmonic analysis is hindered by hybridizations with other low-energy excitations, e.g.~phonons.
In this series of papers we re-introduce and investigate the statistical-mechanical properties
of a class of low-energy quasilocalized modes --- coined here \emph{nonlinear quasilocalized
excitations} (NQEs) --- that are defined via an anharmonic (nonlinear) analysis of the potential
energy landscape of a glass, and do not hybridize with other low-energy excitations. In this first
paper, we review the theoretical framework that embeds a micromechanical definition of NQEs. We
demonstrate how harmonic quasilocalized modes hybridize with other soft excitations, whereas
NQEs properly represent soft spots without hybridization. We show that NQEs' energies converge
to the energies of the softest, non-hybridized harmonic quasilocalized modes, cementing their
status as true representatives of soft spots in structural glasses. Finally, we perform a statistical
analysis of the mechanical properties of NQEs, which results in a prediction for the distribution
of potential energy barriers that surround typical inherent states of structural glasses, as well
as a prediction for the distribution of local strain thresholds to plastic instability.
