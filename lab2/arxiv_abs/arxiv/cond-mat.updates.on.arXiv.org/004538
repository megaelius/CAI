The standard theory of Coulomb blockade [$P(E)$ theory] in ultra-small tunnel junctions has been
formulated on the basis of phase-phase correlations by several authors. It was recently extended
by several experimental and theoretical works to account for novel features ranging from time-reversal
asymmetry to electromagnetic environment-based renormalization effects. Despite this progress,
the theory remains elusive in the case of one dimensional arrays. Here, we apply path integral formalism
to derive the Cooper-pair current and the BCS quasi-particle current in single small Josephson
junctions and extend it to include long Josephson junction arrays as effective single junctions.
We consider renormalization effects due to the electromagnetic environment in the single junction
as well as the array. As is the case in the single junction, we find that the spectrum of applied oscillating
electromagnetic fields is renormalized by the same complex-valued factor $\Xi(\omega) = |\Xi(\omega)|\exp
i\eta(\omega)$ that modifies the environmental impedance in the $P(E)$ function. This factor
acts as a linear response function for applied oscillating electromagnetic fields driving the
quantum circuit, leading to a mass gap in the thermal spectrum of the electromagnetic field. The
mass gap can be modeled as a pair of exotic particle excitation with quantum statistics determined
by the argument $\eta(\omega)$. In the case of the array, this pair corresponds to a bosonic charge
soliton/anti-soliton pair injected into the array by the electromagnetic field. Possible application
of these results is in dynamical Coulomb blockade experiments where long arrays are used as electromagnetic
power detectors.
