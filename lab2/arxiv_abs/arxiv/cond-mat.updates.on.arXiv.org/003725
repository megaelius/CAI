The Dicke model famously exhibits a phase transition to a superradiant phase with a macroscopic
population of photons and is realized in multiple settings in open quantum systems. In this work,
we study a variant of the Dicke model where the cavity mode is lossy due to the coupling to a Markovian
environment while the atomic mode is coupled to a colored bath. We analytically investigate this
model by inspecting its low-frequency behavior via the Schwinger-Keldysh field theory and carefully
examine the nature of the corresponding superradiant phase transition. Integrating out the fast
modes, we can identify a simple effective theory allowing us to derive analytical expressions for
various critical exponents, including those, such as the dynamical critical exponent, that have
not been previously considered. We find excellent agreement with previous numerical results when
the non-Markovian bath is at zero temperature; however, contrary to these studies, our low-frequency
approach reveals that the same exponents govern the critical behavior when the colored bath is at
finite temperature unless the chemical potential is zero. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant
phase transition is classical in nature, while it is genuinely non-equilibrium. We derive a fractional
Langevin equation and conjecture the associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation that capture
the system's long-time memory as well as its non-equilibrium behavior. Finally, we consider finite-size
effects at the phase transition and identify the finite-size scaling exponents, unlocking a rich
behavior in both statics and dynamics of the photonic and atomic observables.
