Several years ago, there were rumors that metals might have an awkward cousin, whom people are sort
of expecting but have never made acquaintance. As though he/she shares metallic features -- conducting
-- but is distinctively different and even invisible if one approaches him/her in conventional
manners -- acquiring no Fermi surface or quasiparticles. Of course, the real content of such metaphor
ammounts to the fact that there exists new quantum metallic state that conducts electricity but
is orthogonal to the established paradigm of Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL), and such state might hold
the key of understanding the perplexing experimental observations of quantum metals that are beyond
FL -- dubbed non-Fermi-liquid (nFL) -- ranging from the Cu- and Fe-based oxides, heavy fermion compounds
to the recently discovered twisted graphene heterostructures. However, to realize such exotic
state of matter, at least theoretically, one would need to construct a lattice model and solve it
with unbiased quantum many-body machinery. Here, we achieve this goal by designing a 2D lattice
model comprised of matter fields coupled with dynamic Z2 gauge fields, and studying it with sign-free
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find as the bosonic matter fields become disordered, the system
reacts with changing its nature from the conventional normal metal of FL with proper Fermi surface
to an orthogonal metal of nFL without Fermi surface and quasiparticle and yet still responds to external
perturbation with hidden fermionic degrees of freedom. Such a quantum phase transition from a normal
metal to an orthogonal metal has never been seen before and certainly violated the Luttinger's theorem.
These results are calling for the establishment of new paradigm of quantum metals and their transition
with conventional ones. Rumor turns out to be true, as always, that metals indeed have an awkaward
cousin.
