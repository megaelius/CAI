Hybrid oxide molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE), a thin-film deposition technique in which transition
metal cations are delivered using a metal-organic precursor, has emerged as the state-of-the-art
approach to the synthesis of electronic-grade complex oxide films with a stoichiometric growth
window. However, numerous questions remain regarding the chemical mechanisms of the growth process
and the surface properties of the resulting films. To examine these properties, thin film SrTiO$_{3}$
(STO) was prepared by hMBE using a titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) precursor for Ti delivery
and an elemental Sr source on annealed STO and Nb-doped STO substrates with varying TTIP:Sr flux
ratios to examine the conditions for the reported stoichiometric growth window. The grown films
were transferred to an appended x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system under ultrahigh
vacuum to study the surface elemental composition in the STO samples. Low energy electron diffraction
and microscopy (LEED/LEEM) measurements were also performed to correlate the XPS data with the
surface termination. Also, samples were examined using x-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to compare
our surface sensitive results with previously reported measurements of the bulk of the films in
the literature. We find that a surface exhibiting a mixture of SrO and TiO$_{2}$ termination, or
a full SrO termination is necessary to obtain stoichiometric adsorption-controlled step-flow
growth. These results indicate that surface Sr is necessary to maintain chemical equilibrium These
results can open new opportunities for the study of interfacial structures synthesized via hMBE.
