We demonstrate the emergence of the non-Abelian geometric potentials and thus the three-dimensional
(3D) spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for ultracold atoms without using the laser beams. This is achieved
by subjecting an atom to a periodic perturbation which is the product of a position-dependent Hermitian
operator $\hat{V}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)$ and a fast oscillating periodic function $f\left(\omega
t\right)$ with a zero average. To have a significant spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we analyze a situation
where the characteristic energy of the periodic driving is not necessarily small compared to the
driving energy $\hbar\omega$. Applying a unitary transformation to eliminate the original periodic
perturbation, we arrive at a non-Abelian (non-commuting) vector potential term describing the
3D SOC. The general formalism is illustrated by analyzing the motion of an atom in a spatially inhomogeneous
magnetic field oscillating in time. A cylindrically symmetric magnetic field provides the SOC
involving the coupling between the spin $\mathbf{F}$ and all three components of the orbital angular
momentum (OAM) $\mathbf{L}$. In particular, the spherically symmetric monopole-type synthetic
magnetic field $\mathbf{B}\propto\mathbf{r}$ generates the 3D SOC of the $\mathbf{L}\cdot \mathbf{F}$
form, which resembles the fine-structure interaction of hydrodgen atom. However, the strength
of the SOC here goes as $1/r^{2}$ for larger distances, instead of $1/r^3$ as in atomic fine structure.
Such a longer-ranged SOC significantly affects not only the lower states of the trapped atom, but
also the higher ones. Furthermore, by properly tailoring the external trapping potential, the
ground state of the system can occur at finite OAM, while the ground state of hydrogen atom has zero
OAM.
