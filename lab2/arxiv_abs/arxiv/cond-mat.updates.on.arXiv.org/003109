In this work we undertake a comprehensive numerical study of the ground state structures and optical
absorption spectra of isomers of B$_{12}$ cluster. Geometry optimization was performed at the
coupled-cluster-singles-doubles (CCSD) level of theory, employing cc-pVDZ extended basis sets.
Once the geometry of a given isomer was optimized, its ground state energy was calculated more accurately
at the coupled-cluster-singles-doubles along with perturbative treatment of triples (CCSD(T))
level of theory, employing larger cc-pVTZ basis sets. Thus, our computed values of binding energies
of various isomers are expected to be quite accurate. Our geometry optimization reveals eleven
distinct isomers, along with their point group, and electronic ground state symmetries. We also
performed vibrational frequency analysis on the three lowest energy isomers, and found them to
be stable. Therefore, we computed the linear optical absorption spectra of these isomers of B$_{12}$,
employing large-scale multi-reference singles-doubles configuration-interaction (MRSDCI)
approach, and found a strong structure-property relationship. This implies that the spectral
fingerprints of the geometries can be utilized for optical detection, and characterization, of
various isomers of B$_{12}$. We also explored the stability of the isomer with with the structure
of a perfect icosahedron, with $I_{h}$ symmetry. In bulk boron icosahedron is the basic structural
unit, but, our vibrational frequency analysis reveals that it is unstable in the isolated form.
We speculate that this instability could be due to Jahn-Teller distortion because five-fold degenerate
HOMO orbitals in $I_{h}$ structure are unfilled.
