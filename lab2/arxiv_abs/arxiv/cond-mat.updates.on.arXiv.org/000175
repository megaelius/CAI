We report our first principles investigations on phonons of three polytypes of BaTiO3 (BTO): paraelectric
(PE) cubic Pm-3m and two ferroelectric (FE) phases, tetragonal P4mm and rhombohedral R3m. We reviewed
the phonon frequencies calculated by using various exchange-correlation functionals, including
density functional theory, Hartree-Fock approximation, and their hybrids. By calculating the
phonon modes as a function of pressure, P from -15 - 230 GPa, we explored the pressure-induced interplays
between modes from individual phases. The pressure-sensitive modes of FE phases showed softening
and converged to the modes of PE phase at pressure below ~ 10 GPa. These results on FE phases can be interpreted
as phonon-precursors for symmetry change from low- to high-symmetry and partly as a theoretical
explanation for the pressure-induced mode-coupling behaviors of Sood et al. [Phys. Rev. B 51, 8892
(1995)]. As pressure is applied further beyond ~ 50 GPa to the cubic PE phase, the lowest F1u mode softens
again and diverges into two separate modes of tetragonal FE P4mm at above ~ 150 GPa. These phonon-branching
behaviors at high pressure provide clear re-confirmations of the re-entrant ferroelectricity
predicted in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 196804 (2005); Phys. Rev. B 74, 180101 (2006); ibid. 85, 054108
(2012)]. The high-pressure-re-entrant FE polarization is not found in the rhombohedral structure;
instead, the centosymmetric R-3m phase is favored at above ~ 30 GPa. The phonon modes calculated
for phonon-propagation vectors at high-symmetry directions show that the Pm-3m phase has a polar
instability at {\Gamma} point and non-polar instabilities at X, M, and R points at high pressure.
