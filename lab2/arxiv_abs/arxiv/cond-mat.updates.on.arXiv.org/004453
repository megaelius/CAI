If near-room-temperature (NRT) superconductivity in hydrides/deuterides is originated from
the electron-phonon coupling, then the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, and phonon
spectrum characteristics (for instance, the Debye temperature, T$_D$, logarithmic phonon frequency,
$\omega$$_{ln}$) should be linked through the electron-phonon coupling constant, $\lambda$$_{e-ph}$,
which can be accurately computed by first-principles calculations. By utilizing relations between
Tc, T$_D$ or $\omega$$_{ln}$, and $\lambda$$_{e-ph}$ (proposed by McMillan (1968), Allen and
Dynes (1975)) it is possible to affirm/disprove the electron-phonon coupling mechanism in the
superconductor. In this paper, we deduce T$_D$ for highly-compressed black phosphorous, boron,
GeAs, SiH4, H3S and D3S by the fit of temperature-dependent resistivity data, R(T), to Bloch-Gruneisen
equation. We show that computed $\lambda$$_{e-ph}$ for highly-compressed black phosphorous,
boron, GeAs, and SiH4 are within BCS weak-coupling limit. We also find remarkable constancy of T$_D$=1531
K for H3S at different ageing stages. Due to phonon spectra in H3S and D3S have identical shape, we
show that these isotopic counterparts obey the relation of T$_D$(H3S)/T$_D$(D3S)=Tc(H3S)/Tc(D3S)=$\omega$$_{ln}$(H3S)/$\omega$$_{ln}$(D3S).
However, ratios of Tc(H3S)/Tc(D3S)=$\omega$$_{ln}$(H3S)/$\omega$$_{ln}$(D3S)=1.27 are
largely different from deduced T$_D$(H3S)/T$_D$(D3S)=1.65. This alludes that NRT superconductivity
in H3S-D3S system is originated from more than one mechanism, where the electron-phonon coupling
lifts Tc in H3S vs D3S, but primary origin for NRT background of Tc~150 K in H3S and D3S remains to be
discovered.
