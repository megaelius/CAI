The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of amorphous solids is markedly different
from that of their crystalline counterparts, but exhibits universal behaviour. Sound attenuation
is believed to be related to this universal behaviour. Recent computer simulations demonstrated
that in the harmonic approximation sound attenuation $\Gamma$ obeys quartic, Rayleigh scattering
scaling for small wavevectors $k$ and quadratic scaling for wavevectors above the Ioffe-Regel
limit. However, simulations and experiments do not provide a clear picture of what to expect at finite
temperatures where anharmonic effects become relevant. Here we study sound attenuation at finite
temperatures for model glasses of various stability, from unstable glasses that exhibit rapid
aging to glasses whose stability is equal to those created in laboratory experiments. We find several
scaling laws depending on the temperature and stability of the glass. First, we find the large wavevector
quadratic scaling to be unchanged at all temperatures. Second, we find that at small wavectors $\Gamma
\sim k^{1.5}$ for an aging glass, but $\Gamma \sim k^2$ when the glass does not age on the timescale
of the calculation. For our most stable glass, we find that $\Gamma \sim k^2$ at small wavevectors,
then a crossover to Rayleigh scattering scaling $\Gamma \sim k^4$, followed by another crossover
to the quadratic scaling at large wavevectors. Our computational observation of this quadratic
behavior reconciles simulation, theory and experiment, and will advance the understanding of
the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of glasses.
