Conventional impurity doping of deep nanoscale silicon (dns-Si) used in ultra large scale integration
(ULSI) faces serious challenges below the 14 nm technology node. We report on a new fundamental effect
in theory and experiment, namely the electronic structure of dns-Si experiencing energy offsets
of ca. 1 eV as a function of SiO$_2$- vs. Si$_3$N$_4$-embedding with a few monolayers (MLs). An interface
charge transfer (ICT) from dns-Si specific to the anion type of the dielectric is at the core of this
effect and arguably nested in quantum-chemical properties of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) vs. Si.
We investigate the size up to which this energy offset defines the electronic structure of dns-Si
by density functional theory (DFT), considering interface orientation, embedding layer thickness,
and approximants featuring two Si nanocrystals (NCs); one embedded in SiO$_2$ and the other in Si$_3$N$_4$.
Working with synchrotron ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), we use SiO$_2$- vs. Si$_3$N$_4$-embedded
Si nanowells (NWells) to obtain their energy of the top valence band states. These results confirm
our theoretical findings and gauge an analytic model for projecting maximum dns-Si sizes for NCs,
nanowires (NWires) and NWells where the energy offset reaches full scale, yielding to a clear preference
for electrons or holes as majority carriers in dns-Si. Our findings can replace impurity doping
for n/p-type dns-Si as used in ultra-low power electronics and ULSI, eliminating dopant-related
issues such as inelastic carrier scattering, thermal ionization, clustering, out-diffusion
and defect generation. As far as majority carrier preference is concerned, the elimination of those
issues effectively shifts the lower size limit of Si-based ULSI devices to the crystalization limit
of Si of ca. 1.5 nm and enables them to work also under cryogenic conditions.
