In this work we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the phase behavior of spherical caps confined
between two parallel hard walls separated by a distance H. The particle model consists of a hard sphere
of diameter \sigma cut off by a plane at a height \chi, and it is loosely based on mushroom cap-shaped
particles whose phase behavior was recently studied experimentally [E. K. Riley and C. M. Liddell,
Langmuir, 26, 11648 (2010)]. The geometry of the particles is characterized by the reduced height
\chi^* = \chi/\sigma, such that the model extrapolates between hard spheres for \chi^* \leftarrow
1 and infinitely thin hard platelets for \chi^* \letfarrow 0. Three different particle shapes are
investigated: (a) three-quarter height spherical caps (\chi^* = 3/4), (b) one-half height spherical
caps or hemispheres (\chi^* = 1/2), and (c) one-quarter height spherical caps (\chi^* = 1/4). These
three models are used to rationalize the effect of particle shape, obtained by cutting off spheres
at different heights, on the entropy-driven self-assembly of the particles under strong confinements;
i.e., for 1 < H/\chi < 2.5. As H is varied, a sequence of crystal structures are observed, including
some having similar symmetry as that of the structures observed in confined hard spheres on account
of the remaining spherical surface in the particles, but with additional features on account of
the particle shapes having intrinsic anisotropy and orientational degrees of freedom. The \chi^*
= 3/4 system is found to exhibit a phase diagram that is most similar to the one obtained experimentally
for the confined mushroom cap-shaped colloidal particles under. A qualitative global phase diagram
is constructed that helps reveal the interrelations among different phases for all the particle
shapes and confinements studied.
