The Kitaev spin model offers an exact quantum spin liquid in the ground state, which has stimulated
exploration of its material realization over the last decade. Thus far, most of the candidates are
found in $4d$- and $5d$-electron compounds, in which the low-spin $d^5$ electron configuration
subject to strong spin-orbit coupling comprises a Kramers doublet with the effective angular momentum
$j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ and gives rise to the bond-dependent anisotropic interactions in the Kitaev
model. Here we theoretically investigate other candidates in $4f$-electron compounds with the
$f^1$ electron configuration on both quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb and three-dimensional
hyperhoneycomb structures, $A_2$PrO$_3$ with $A$=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs. Based on {\it ab initio}
calculations, we show that the electronic structures of these compounds host a spin-orbital entangled
Kramers doublet with $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ in the $\Gamma_7$ state. By constructing the tight-binding
Hamiltonian and performing a perturbation expansion, we find that the low-energy magnetic properties
of $A_2$PrO$_3$ are well described by an effective spin model with the $J$-$K$-$\Gamma'$ model.
The most remarkable feature is that the Kitaev interaction $K$ is antiferromagnetic, in contrast
to the ferromagnetic one in the $d^5$ candidates at hand. The exchange interactions are systematically
modulated by changing the $A$-site cations. As a consequence, the compounds with $A$=Li and Na may
have a dominant antiferromagnetic $K$, but $J$ dominates $K$ and $\Gamma'$ in the cases with $A$=Rb
and Cs. Also, by computing the ground states of the $J$-$K$-$\Gamma'$ model by using the exact diagonalization,
we map out the systematic evolution of the model parameters in the phase diagram. Our results will
stimulate material exploration of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev interaction in $f$-electron
compounds.
