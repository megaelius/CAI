In transport experiments the quantum nature of matter becomes directly evident when changes in
conductance occur only in discrete steps, with a size determined solely by Planck's constant h.
The observations of quantized steps in the electric conductance have provided important insights
into the physics of mesoscopic systems and allowed for the development of quantum electronic devices.
Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of electric charges, it has never
been observed for neutral, massive particles. In its most fundamental form, the phenomenon requires
a quantum degenerate Fermi gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction
with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report on the observation of quantized
conductance in the transport of neutral atoms. We employ high resolution lithography to shape light
potentials that realize either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions
are imprinted on a quasi two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting two adjustable reservoirs
of quantum degenerate fermionic lithium atoms. By tuning either a gate potential or the transverse
confinement of the constrictions, we observe distinct plateaus in the conductance for atoms. The
conductance in the first plateau is found to be equal to 1/h, the universal conductance quantum.
For low gate potentials we find good agreement between the experimental data and the Landauer formula,
with all parameters determined a priori. Our experiment constitutes the cold atom version of a mesoscopic
device and can be readily extended to more complex geometries and interacting quantum gases.
