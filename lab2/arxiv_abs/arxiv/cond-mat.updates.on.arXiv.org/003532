The development of qualitatively new measurement capabilities is often a prerequisite for critical
scientific and technological advances. The dramatic progress made by modern probe techniques
to uncover the microscopic structure of matter is fundamentally rooted in our control of two defining
traits of quantum mechanics: discreteness of physical properties and interference phenomena.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging, for instance, exploits the fact that protons have spin and can absorb
photons at frequencies that depend on the medium to image the anatomy and physiology of living systems.
Scattering techniques, in which photons, electrons, protons or neutrons are used as probes, make
use of quantum interference to directly image the spatial position of individual atoms, their magnetic
structure, or even unveil their concomitant dynamical correlations. None of these probes have
so far exploited a unique characteristic of the quantum world: entanglement. Here we introduce
a fundamentally new quantum probe, an entangled neutron beam, where individual neutrons can be
entangled in spin, trajectory and energy. Its tunable entanglement length from nanometers to microns
and energy differences from peV to neV will enable new investigations of microscopic magnetic correlations
in systems with strongly entangled phases, such as those believed to emerge in unconventional superconductors.
We develop an interferometer to prove entanglement of these distinguishable properties of the
neutron beam by observing clear violations of both Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Mermin contextuality
inequalities in the same experimental setup. Our work opens a pathway to a future era of entangled
neutron scattering in matter.
