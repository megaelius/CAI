We investigate in detail the problem of confined pressure-driven laminar flow of neutrally buoyant
non-Brownian suspensions using a frictional rheology based on the recent proposal of Boyer et al.,
2011. The friction coefficient and solid volume fraction are taken as functions of the dimensionless
viscous number I defined as the ratio between the fluid shear stress and the particle normal stress.
We clarify the contributions of the contact and hydrodynamic interactions on the evolution of the
friction coefficient between the dilute and dense regimes reducing the phenomenological constitutive
description to three physical parameters. We also propose an extension of this constitutive law
from the flowing regime to the fully jammed state. We obtain an analytical solution of the fully-developed
flow in channel and pipe for the frictional suspension rheology. The result can be transposed to
dry granular flow upon appropriate redefinition of the dimensionless number I. The predictions
are in excellent agreement with available experimental results, when using the values of the constitutive
parameters obtained independently from stress-controlled rheological measurements. In particular,
the frictional rheology correctly predicts the transition from Poiseuille to plug flow and the
associated particles migration with the increase of the entrance solid volume fraction. We numerically
solve for the axial development of the flow from the inlet of the channel/pipe toward the fully-developed
state. The available experimental data are in good agreement with our predictions. The solution
of the axial development of the flow provides a quantitative estimation of the entrance length effect
in pipe for suspensions. A analytical expression for development length is shown to encapsulate
the numerical solution in the entire range of flow conditions from dilute to dense.
