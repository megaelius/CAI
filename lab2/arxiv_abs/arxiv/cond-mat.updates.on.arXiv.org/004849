The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of elastic properties of polystyrene-based nanocomposites
filled with different types of inclusions: small spherical particles (SiO2 and Al2O3), alumosilicates
(montmorillonite, halloysite natural tubules and Mica) and carbon nanofillers (carbon black
and multi-walled carbon nanotubes). Composites were fabricated by melt technology. The analysis
of composite melts showed that the introduction of Montmorillonite, Multi-walled carbon nanotubes,
and Al2O3 particles provided an increase in melt viscosity by an average of 2 to 5 orders of magnitude
over the pure polystyrene. Block samples of composites with different filler concentrations were
prepared, and their linear and nonlinear elastic properties were studied. The introduction of
more rigid particles led to a more profound increase in the elastic modulus of the composite, with
the highest rise of about 80% obtained with carbon fillers. Carbon black particles provided also
an enhanced strength at break of about 20% higher than that of pure polystyrene. The nonlinear elastic
moduli of composites were shown to be more sensitive to addition of filler particles to the polymer
matrix than the linear ones. The nonlinearity coefficient $\beta$ comprising the combination
of linear and nonlinear elastic moduli of a material demonstrated considerable changes correlating
with changes of the Young's modulus. The absolute value of $\beta$ showed rise in 1.5-1.6 times in
the CB- and HNT-containing composites as compared to that of pure PS. The changes in nonlinear elasticity
of fabricated composites were compared with measurements of the parameters of bulk nonlinear strain
waves in them. Variations of wave velocity and decay decrement correlated with observed enhancement
of materials nonlinearity.
