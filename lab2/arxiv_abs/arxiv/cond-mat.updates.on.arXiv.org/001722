Decoding the energy pathway by which a DNA unravels is the holy grail of biologists and physicists
alike. The underlying physics is an intriguing competition of entropy ordering and disordering
in the bound and unbound base-pairs of the intermediate bubbles. We re-examine this in a controlled
denaturation study with picoliter solutions of DNA molecules confined in a resonating microfluidic
cantilever. To our surprise, a unique entropy fluctuation interplay of the denaturation bubbles
is revealed, apparent in a two-stage transition profile. The dynamic dissipation at resonance,
which we record, faithfully captures the base-pair binding-unbinding energy landscape, revealing
the singular entropy fluctuation characteristic. We attribute the characteristic to the onset
of an energy fluctuation scale observable only at the small volume scales employed. The fluctuations
apparently favor entropy ordering over disordering at biologically relevant T<42C in a non-equilibrium
transition pathway. The observed ordering energetics suggests the probability of an intermediate
collapsed-bubble conformation releasing energy, sufficient to unbind the bubble ends. An alternate
energy pathway thus surfaces complementing molecular zipper and bubble state cooperativity transitions.
Fluctuation theorem supports our argument, which we further validate from DNA solutions across
varying oligomer lengths, base pair moieties, and concentrations. This new information of fluctuation
driven ordering energetics can contribute to new insights on DNA transcription, the integral basis
of life. The nanomechanical dynamic dissipation paradigm of investigating picoliter bio-samples
as introduced offers a new method for investigating other interesting challenges such as folding
of proteins and cell proliferation, which also evolve through similar energetics of non-equilibrium
processes.
