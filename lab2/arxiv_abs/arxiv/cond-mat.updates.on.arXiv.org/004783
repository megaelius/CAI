Optimal non-local heat-engines, based on Coulomb-coupled systems, demand a sharp step-like change
in the energy resolved system-to-reservoir coupling around the ground state of quantum-dots.
Such a sharp step-like transition in the system-to-reservoir coupling cannot be achieved in a realistic
scenario. Here, I propose realistic design for non-local heat engine based on Coulomb-coupled
system, which circumvents the need for any change in the system-to-reservoir coupling, demanded
by the optimal set-ups discussed in literature. I demonstrate that an intentionally introduced
asymmetry (or energy difference) in the ground state configuration between adjacent tunnel coupled
quantum dots, in conjugation with Coulomb coupling, is sufficient to convert the stochastic fluctuations
from a non-local heat source into a directed flow of thermoelectric current. The performance, along
with the regime of operation, of the proposed heat engine is then theoretically investigated using
quantum-master-equation (QME) approach. It is demonstrated that the theoretical maximum power
output for the proposed set-up is limited to about $50\%$ of the optimal design. Despite a lower performance
compared to the optimal set-up, the novelty of the proposed design lies in the conjunction of fabrication
simplicity along with reasonable power output. At the end, the sequential transport processes
leading to a performance deterioration of the proposed set-up are analyzed and a method to alleviate
such transport processes is discussed. The set-up proposed in this paper can be used to design and
fabricate high-performance non-local cryogenic heat engines.
