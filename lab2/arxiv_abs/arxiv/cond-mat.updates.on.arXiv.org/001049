Ferrofluid heating by an external alternating field is studied based on the rigid dipole model,
where the magnetization of each particle in a fluid is supposed to be firmly fixed in the crystal lattice.
Equations of motion, employing the Newton's second law for rotational motion, the condition of
rigid body rotation, and the assumption that the friction torque is proportional to angular velocity,
are used. This oversimplification permits us to expand the model easily: to take into account the
thermal noise and inter-particle interaction that allows to estimate from unified positions the
role of thermal activation and dipole interaction in the heating process. Our studies are conducted
in three stages. The exact expressions for the average power loss of a single particle are obtained
within the dynamical approximation. Then, in the stochastic case, the power loss of a single particle
is estimated analytically using the Fokker-Planck equation and numerically using the effective
Langevin equation. Finally, the power loss for the particle ensemble is obtained using the molecular
dynamics method. Here, the local dipole fields are calculated approximately based on the Barnes-Hut
algorithm. The revealed trends in the behaviour of both a single particle and the particle ensemble
suggest the way of choosing the conditions for obtaining the maximum heating efficiency. The competitiveness
character of the inter-particle interaction and thermal noise is investigated in details. Two
situations, when the thermal noise rectifies the power loss reduction caused by the interaction,
are described. The first of them is related to the complete destruction of dense clusters at high
noise intensity. The second one is originated from the rare switching of the particles in clusters
due to thermal activation, when the noise intensity is relatively weak.
