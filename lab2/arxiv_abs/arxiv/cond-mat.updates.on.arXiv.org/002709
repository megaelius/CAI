We present a new system based on alginate gels for the encapsulation of a ferrofluid drop, which allows
us to create millimeter-sized elastic capsules that are highly deformable by inhomogeneous magnetic
fields. We use a combination of experimental and theoretical work in order to characterize and quantify
the deformation behavior of these ferrofluid-filled capsules. We introduce a novel method for
the direct encapsulation of unpolar liquids by sodium alginate. The addition of polar alcohol molecules
allows us to encapsulate a ferrofluid as a single phase. This encapsulation method increases the
amount of encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles resulting in high deformations and offers possible
applications of capsules as actuators, switches, or valves in confined spaces like microfluidic
devices. We determine both elastic moduli of the capsule shell, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio,
by employing two independent mechanical methods, spinning capsule measurements and capsule compression
between parallel plates. We then show that the observed magnetic deformation can be fully understood
from magnetic forces exerted by the ferrofluid on the capsule shell if the magnetic field distribution
and magnetization properties of the ferrofluid are known. Using an iterative solution scheme that
couples a finite element / boundary element method for the magnetic field calculation to the solution
of the elastic shape equations, we achieve quantitative agreement between theory and experiment
for deformed capsule shapes using the Young modulus from mechanical characterization and the surface
Poisson ratio as a fit parameter. This detailed analysis confirms the results from mechanical characterization
that the surface Poisson ratio of the alginate shell is close to unity, that is, deformations of the
alginate shell are almost area conserving.
