We develop a Split Reactive Brownian Dynamics (SRBD) algorithm for particle simulations of reaction-diffusion
systems based on the Doi or volume reactivity model, in which pairs of particles react with a specified
Poisson rate if they are closer than a chosen reactive distance. In our Doi model, we ensure that the
microscopic reaction rules for various association and disassociation reactions are consistent
with detailed balance (time reversibility) at thermodynamic equilibrium. The SRBD algorithm
uses Strang splitting in time to separate reaction and diffusion, and solves both the diffusion-only
and reaction-only subproblems exactly, even at high packing densities. To efficiently process
reactions without uncontrolled approximations, SRBD employs an event-driven algorithm that
processes reactions in a time-ordered sequence over the duration of the time step. A grid of cells
with size larger than all of the reactive distances is used to schedule and process the reactions,
but unlike traditional grid-based methods such as Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation (RDME)
algorithms, the results of SRBD are statistically independent of the size of the grid used to accelerate
the processing of reactions. We use the SRBD algorithm to compute the effective macroscopic reaction
rate for both reaction- and diffusion-limited irreversible association in three dimensions.
We also study long-time tails in the time correlation functions for reversible association at thermodynamic
equilibrium. Finally, we compare different particle and continuum methods on a model exhibiting
a Turing-like instability and pattern formation. We find that for models in which particles diffuse
off lattice, such as the Doi model, reactions lead to a spurious enhancement of the effective diffusion
coefficients.
