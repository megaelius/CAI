We have studied the body-centered cubic (bcc), face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed
(hcp) phases of Fe alloyed with 25 at. % of Ni at Earth's core conditions using an ab initio local density
approximation + dynamical mean-field theory (LDA+DMFT) approach. The alloys have been modeled
by ordered crystal structures based on the bcc, fcc, and hcp unit cells with minimum possible cell
size allowing for the proper composition. Our calculations demonstrate that the strength of electronic
correlations on the Fe 3d shell is highly sensitive to the phase and local environment. In the bcc
phase the 3d electrons at the Fe site with Fe only nearest neighbors remain rather strongly correlated
even at extreme pressure-temperature conditions, with the local and uniform magnetic susceptibility
exhibiting a Curie-Weiss-like temperature evolution and the quasi-particle lifetime {\Gamma}
featuring a non-Fermi-liquid temperature dependence. In contrast, for the corresponding Fe site
in the hcp phase we predict a weakly-correlated Fermi-liquid state with a temperature-independent
local susceptibility and a quadratic temperature dependence of {\Gamma}. The iron sites with nickel
atoms in the local environment exhibit behavior in the range between those two extreme cases, with
the strength of correlations gradually increasing along the hcp-fcc-bcc sequence. Further, the
inter-site magnetic interactions in the bcc and hcp phases are also strongly affected by the presence
of Ni nearest neighbors. The sensitivity to the local environment is related to modifications of
the Fe partial density of states due to mixing with Ni 3d-states.
