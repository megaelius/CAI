In view of the recent applications of chiral anomaly to various fields beyond particle physics,
we discuss some basic aspects of chiral anomaly which may help deepen our understanding of chiral
anomaly in particle physics also. It is first shown that Berry's phase (and its generalization)
for the Weyl model $H =v_{F} \vec{\sigma}\cdot \vec{p}(t)$ assumes a monopole form at the exact
adiabatic limit but deviates from it off the adiabatic limit and vanishes in the high frequency limit
of the Fourier transform of $\vec{p}(t)$ for bounded $|\vec{p}(t)|$. An effective action, which
is consistent with the non-adiabatic limit of Berry's phase, combined with the Bjorken-Johnson-Low
prescription gives normal equal-time space-time commutators and no chiral anomaly. In contrast,
an effective action with a monopole at the origin of the momentum space, which describes Berry's
phase in the precise adiabatic limit but fails off the adiabatic limit, gives anomalous space-time
commutators and a covariant anomaly to the gauge current. We regard this anomaly as an artifact of
the postulated monopole and not a consequence of Berry's phase. As for the recent application of
the chiral anomaly to the description of effective Weyl fermions in condensed matter and nuclear
physics, which is closely related to the formulation of lattice chiral fermions, we point out that
the chiral anomaly for each species doubler separately vanishes for a finite lattice spacing, contrary
to the common assumption. Instead a general form of pair creation associated with the spectral flow
for the Dirac sea with finite depth takes place. This view is supported by the Ginsparg-Wilson fermion,
which defines a single Weyl fermion without doublers on the lattice and gives a well-defined index
(anomaly) even for a finite lattice spacing.
