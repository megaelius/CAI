We consider the superconducting pairing induced by spin waves exchange in a ferromagnet with both
conduction and localized electrons, the latter being described as spins. We use the microscopic
Eliashberg theory to describe the pairing of conducting electrons and the RPA approach to treat
the localized spins assuming an exchange coupling between the conducting electrons and spins.
In the framework of non relativistic Hamiltonian twe found that he spin wave exchange results in
equal spin electron pairing described by the two components of the order parameter, $\Delta^{\uparrow}$
(both spins up) and $\Delta^{\downarrow}$ (both spins down). Due to the conservation of total spin
projection on the axis of the spontaneous ferromagnetic moment, the spin wave exchange at low temperatures
includes an emission of magnons and an absorption of thermal magnons by the conduction electrons.
The absorption and emission processes depend differently on the temperature, with the absorption
being progressively suppressed as the temperature drops. As a result, the superconducting pairing
exists only if the electron-spin wave exchange parameter $g$ exceeds some critical value $g_c$.
At $g>g_c$ pairing vanishes if the temperature drops below the lowest point $T_{cl}$ or increases
above the upper critical point $T_{ch} \approx T_m$ (the Curie temperature) where the spin waves
cease to exist. This behavior inherent to the spin carrying glue is in an obvious disagreement with
the results of conventional BCS approach which assumes that the effective electron-electron attraction
is simply proportional to the static magnetic susceptibility.
