Despite the fast development of computational materials modelling, theoretical description
of macroscopic elastic properties of textured polycrystalline aggregates starting from basic
principles remains a challenging task. In this communication we use a supercell-based approach
to obtain the elastic properties of random solid solution cubic ZrAlN system as a function of the
metallic sublattice composition and texture descriptors. The employed special quasi-random
structures are optimised not only with respect to short range order parameters, but also to make
the three cubic directions $[1\,0\,0]$, $[0\,1\,0]$, and $[0\,0\,1]$ as similar as possible.
In this way, only a small spread of elastic constants tensor components is achieved and an optimum
trade-off between modelling of chemical disorder and computational limits regarding the supercell
size is achieved. The single crystal elastic constants are shown to vary smoothly with composition,
yielding $x\approx0.4$-0.5 an alloy constitution with an almost isotropic response. Consequently,
polycrystals with this composition are suggested to have Young's modulus independent on the actual
microstructure. This is indeed confirmed by explicit calculations of polycrystal elastic properties,
both within the isotropic aggregate limit, as well as with fibre textures with various orientations
and sharpness. It turns out, that for low AlN mole fractions, the spread of the possible Young's moduli
data caused by the texture variation can be larger than 100 GPa. Consequently, our discussion of
Young's modulus data of cubic ZrAlN contains also the evaluation of the texture typical for thin
films.
