Many magnetic point-group symmetries induce a topological classification on crystalline insulators,
dividing them into those that have a nonzero quantized Chern-Simons magnetoelectric coupling
("axion-odd" or "topological"), and those that do not ("axion-even" or "trivial"). For time-reversal
or inversion symmetries, the resulting topological state is usually denoted as a "strong topological
insulator" or an "axion insulator" respectively, but many other symmetries can also protect this
"axion $Z_2$" index. Topological states are often insightfully characterized by choosing one
crystallographic direction of interest, and inspecting the hybrid Wannier (or equivalently,
the non-Abelian Wilson-loop) band structure, considered as a function of the two-dimensional
Brillouin zone in the orthogonal directions. Here, we systematically classify the axion-quantizing
symmetries, and explore the implications of such symmetries on the Wannier band structure. Conversely,
we clarify the conditions under which the axion$Z_2$ index can be deduced from the Wannier band structure.
In particular, we identify cases in which a counting of Dirac touchings between Wannier bands, or
a calculation of the Chern number of certain Wannier bands, or both, allows for a direct determination
of the axion $Z_2$ index. We also discuss when such symmetries impose a "flow" on the Wannier bands,
such that they are always glued to higher and lower bands by degeneracies somewhere in the projected
Brillouin zone, and the related question of when the corresponding surfaces can remain gapped,
thus exhibiting a half-quantized surface anomalous Hall conductivity. Our formal arguments are
confirmed and illustrated in the context of tight-binding models for several paradigmatic axion-odd
symmetries including time reversal, inversion, simple mirror, and glide mirror symmetries.
