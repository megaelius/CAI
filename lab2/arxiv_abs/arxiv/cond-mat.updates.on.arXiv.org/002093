Correlation effects in CuO$_2$ layers give rise to a complicated landscape of collective excitations
in high-T$_{\rm c}$ cuprates. Their description requires an accurate account for electronic fluctuations
at a very broad energy range and remains a challenge for the theory. Particularly, there is no conventional
explanation of the experimentally observed `resonant' antiferromagnetic mode, which is often
considered to be a mediator of superconductivity. Here we model spin excitations of the hole-doped
cuprates in the paramagnetic regime and show that this antiferromagnetic mode is associated with
electronic transitions between anti-nodal X and Y points of the quasiparticle band that is pinned
to the Fermi level. We observe that upon doping of 7-12\% the electronic spectral weight redistribution
leads to the formation of a very stable quasiparticle dispersion due to strong correlation effects.
The reconstruction of the Fermi surface results in a flattening of the quasiparticle band at the
vicinity of the nodal ${\rm M}\Gamma/2$ point, accompanied by a high density of charge carriers.
Collective excitations of electrons between the nodal ${\rm M}\Gamma/2$ and ${\rm XM}/2$ points
form the additional magnetic holes state in magnetic spectrum, which protects the antiferromagnetic
fluctuation. Further investigation of the evolution of spin fluctuations with the temperature
and doping allowed us to observe the incipience of the antiferromagnetic ordering already in the
paramagnetic regime above the transition temperature. Additionally, apart from the most intensive
low-energy magnetic excitations, the magnetic spectrum reveals less intensive collective spin
fluctuations that correspond to electronic processes between peaks of the single-particle spectral
function.
