There is a general perception that large piezoelectric response in ferroelectric alloys requires
tuning the system towards a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), i.e., a composition driven inter-ferroelectric
instability. Here we show that high piezoelectric response can be realized even in non-MPB alloy
systems. This is demonstrated on (1-x)PbTiO3-(x)Bi(Zr0.5Ni0.5)O3 (PT-BNZ) by a comprehensive
study involving electric-field and temperature dependent XRD, Raman spectroscopy, dielectric,
piezoelectric and high field electrostrain measurements. We found that poling-field irreversibly
suppresses the cubic-like phase at room temperature. Based on our results, we argue that that which
appears as MPB, comprising of tetragonal and cubic-like phases on the global scale, is not so actually.
The large piezoresponse is due to coexistence of tetragonal regions of long and short-range coherence.
The PT-BNZ system is therefore qualitatively different from the conventional MPB systems such
as PZT, PMN-PT, and PbTiO3-BiScO3, etc., which exhibits coexisting tetragonal and rhombohedral/monoclinic
phases in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the absence of inter-ferroelectric instability as a phenomenon,
field induced polarization-rotation and inter-ferroelectric transformation are no longer plausible
mechanisms to explain the large piezoelectric response in PT-BNZ. The large piezoelectricity
is primarily due to enhanced mobility of the tetragonal domain walls enabled by domain miniaturization.
Our study proves that attainment of large piezoelectricity does not require inter-ferroelectric
instability as a necessary criterion.
