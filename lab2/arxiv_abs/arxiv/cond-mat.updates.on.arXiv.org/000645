The cluster slave-spin method is introduced to systematically investigate the solutions of the
Hubbard model including the symmetry-broken phases. In this method, the electron operator is factorized
into a fermioninc spinon describing the physical spin and a slave-spin describing the charge fluctuations.
Following the $U(1)$ formalism derived by Yu and Si [Phys. Rev. B 86, 085104 (2012)], it is shown that
the self-consistent equations to explore various symmetry-broken density wave states can be constructed
in general with a cluster of multiple slave-spin sites. We employ this method to study the antiferromagnetic
(AFM) state in the single band Hubbard model with the two and four-site clusters of slave spins. While
the Hubbard gap, the charge gap due to the doubly-occupied states, scales with the Hubbard interaction
$U$ as expected, the AFM gap $\Delta$, the gap in the spinon dispersion in the AFM state, exhibits
a crossover from the weak to strong-coupling behaviors as $U$ increases. Our cluster slave-spin
method reproduces not only the traditional mean-field behavior of $\Delta \sim U$ in the weak-coupling
limit, but also the behavior of $\Delta \sim t^2/U$ predicted by the superexchange mechanism in
the strong coupling limit. In addition, the holon-doublon correlator as functions of $U$ and doping
$x$ is also computed, which exhibits a strong tendency toward the holon-doublon binding in the strong
coupling regime. We further show that the quasiparticle weight obtained by the cluster slave-spin
method is in a good agreement with the generalized Gutzwiller approximation in both AFM and paramagnetic
states, and the results can be improved beyond the generalized Gutzwiller approximation as the
cluster is enlarged from a single site to 4 sites. Our results demonstrate that the cluster slave-spin
method can be a powerful tool to systematically investigate the strongly correlated system.
