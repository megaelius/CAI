The dynamics of a weakly anharmonic superconducting qubit in a complex electromagnetic environment
is generally well-described by an effective multimode Kerr Hamiltonian at sufficiently weak excitation.
This Hamiltonian can be embedded in a master equation with losses determined by the details of the
electromagnetic environment. Recent experiments indicate, however, that when a superconducting
circuit is driven with microwave signals the observed relaxation rates appear to be substantially
different from expectations based on the electromagnetic environment of the qubit alone. This
issue is a limiting factor in the optimization of superconducting qubit readout schemes. We claim
here that an effective master equation with drive-power dependent parameters is an efficient approach
to model such quantum dynamics. In this sequence of papers, we derive effective master equations,
whose parameters exhibit nonlinear dependence on the excitation level of the circuit as well as
the electromagnetic environment of the qubit. We show that the number non-conserving terms in the
qubit nonlinearity generally lead to a renormalization of dissipative parameters of the effective
master equation, while the number conserving terms give rise to a renormalization of the system
frequencies. Here, in Part I, we consider the excitation-relaxation dynamics of a transmon qubit
that is prepared in a certain initial state, but is not driven otherwise. A unitary transformation
technique is introduced to study the renormalization of i) qubit relaxation due to coupling to a
generic bath and ii) Purcell decay. Analytic expressions are provided for the dependence of the
nonlinear dissipative terms on the details of the electromagnetic environment of the qubit. The
perturbation technique based on unitary transformations developed here is generalized to the
continuously driven case in Part II.
