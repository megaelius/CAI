We study the all-to-all connected $XYZ$ (anisotropic-Heisenberg) spin model with local and collective
dissipations, comparing the results of mean field theory with the solution of the Lindblad quantum
evolution. Leveraging the permutational symmetry of the model [N. Shammah et al., Phys Rev. A 98,
063815 (2018)], we find exactly (up to numerical precision) the steady state up to $N=95$ spins.
We characterize criticality, studying, as a function of the number of spins $N$, the spin structure
factor, the magnetization, the Liouvillian gap and the Von Neumann entropy of the steady state.
Exploiting the weak $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of the model, we efficiently calculate the Liouvillian
gap, introducing the idea of an antigap. For small anisotropy, we find a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic
phase transition in agreement with the mean-field theory. For large anisotropy, instead, we find
a significant discrepancy from the scaling of the low-anisotropy ferromagnetic phase. We also
study other more experimentally-accessible witnesses of the transition, which can be used for
finite-size studies, namely the bimodality coefficient and the angular averaged susceptibility.
In contrast to the bimodality coefficient, the angular averaged susceptibility fails to capture
the onset of the transition, in striking difference with respect to lower-dimensional studies.
We also analyze the competition between local dissipative processes (which disentangle the spin
system) and collective dissipative ones (generating entanglement). The nature of the phase transition
is almost unaffected by the presence of these terms. Our results mark a stark difference with the
common intuition that an all-to-all connected system should fall onto the mean-field solution
also for intermediate number of spins.
