Natural rubber vucanizates containing 0-50 phr of a fine carbon black (N115,d=27nm) were prepared
and tensile strengths of normal (no pre-cut) and edge pre-cut specimens were determined. Normal
tensile strengths of all vulcanizates were similar. At the relatively slow strain rate experienced
wholesale by normal uncut specimens, all vulcanizates, prior to crack initiation, strain-crystallized
sufficiently to be strong. However, pre-cut specimens experience increased strain rate at a cut
tip. Magnification of the strain rate increases as cut depth c increases. Fracture in the gum NR and
vulcanizates with up to 14 phr of black occurred by simple forward crack growth from a cut tip, and
all exhibited a critical cut size, above which strength dropped abruptly. Furthermore, for these
lightly filled samples, strength and critical cut size decreased with increased black content.
This indicates less strain-crystalliation before rupture of pre-cut specimens, when levels of
black are low. This effect is attributerd to rapid straining at a cut tip and hindering of the chain
mobility necessary for crystallization. When black content was increased to 15 phr, with 1 mm<c<2
mm, about 50% of specimens retained simple lateral fracture and were weak, but the other 50% developed
deviated cracks (knotty tearing) and were significantly stronger than corresponding pre-cut
gum specimens, especially at large c. High strength with sufficient black levels are attributed
to increased strain-crystallization and super-blunting (multiple cracks) at a cut tip. These
inhibit forward crack growth. For carbon black to enhance strain-crystallization relative to
the gum, it appears there must be enough of it to form a bound rubber/black network. If the black concentration
is less than this percolation threshold, strain-crystallization is hindered at a cut tip.
