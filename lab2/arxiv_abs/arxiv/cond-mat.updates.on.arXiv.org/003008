The semiconducting behaviour and optoelectronic response of gallium nitride is governed by point
defect processes, which, despite many years of research, remain poorly understood. The key difficulty
in the description of the dominant charged defects is determining a consistent position of the corresponding
defect levels, which is difficult to derive using standard supercell calculations. In a complementary
approach, we take advantage of the embedded cluster methodology that provides direct access to
a common zero of the electrostatic potential for all point defects in all charge states. Charged
defects polarise a host dielectric material with long-range forces that strongly affect the outcome
of defect simulations; to account for the polarisation we couple embedding with the hybrid quantum
mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach and investigate the structure, formation
and ionisation energies, and equilibrium concentrations of native point defects in wurtzite GaN
at a chemically accurate hybrid-density-functional-theory level. N vacancies are the most thermodynamically
favourable native defects in GaN, which contribute to the n-type character of as-grown GaN but are
not the main source, a result that is consistent with experiment. Our calculations show no native
point defects can form thermodynamically stable acceptor states. GaN can be easily doped n-type,
but, in equilibrium conditions at moderate temperatures acceptor dopants will be compensated
by N vacancies and no significant hole concentrations will be observed, indicating non-equilibrium
processes must dominate in p-type GaN. We identify spectroscopic signatures of native defects
in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet luminescence ranges and complementary spectroscopies.
Crucially, we calculate the effective-mass-like-state levels associated with electrons and
holes bound in diffuse orbitals...
