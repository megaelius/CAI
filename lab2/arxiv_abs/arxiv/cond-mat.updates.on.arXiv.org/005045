The Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond plays important roles in emerging quantum technologies.
Currently available methods to fabricate the NV center often involve complex processes such as
N implantation. By contrast, in a diamond-like compound C3BN, creating a boron (B) vacancy immediately
leads to an NV center analog. We use the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semilocal
density functional - this functional leads to nearly the same zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy as the
experiment and as obtained from the more time-consuming hybrid density functional calculations
- to explore the potential of this NV center analog as a novel spin qubit for applications in quantum
information processing. We show that the NV center analog in C3BN possesses many similar properties
to the NV center in diamond including a wide band gap, weak spin-orbit coupling, an energetically
stable negatively charged state, a highly localized spin density, a paramagnetic triplet ground
state, and strong hyperfine interactions, which are the properties that make the NV center in diamond
stand out as a suitable quantum bit (qubit). We predict the NV center analog in C3BN to exhibit two
ZPL energies that correspond to longer wavelengths close to the ideal telecommunication band for
quantum communications. C3BN studied here represents only one example of A3XY (A: group IV element;
X/Y: group III/V elements) compounds. We expect many other compounds of this family to have similar
NV center analogs with a wide range of ZPL energies and functional properties, promising to be new
hosts of qubits for quantum technology applications. Furthermore, A3XY compounds often contain
group IV elements such as silicon and germanium, so they are compatible with the sophisticated semiconductor
processing techniques. Our work opens up ample opportunities towards scalable qubit host materials
and novel quantum devices.
