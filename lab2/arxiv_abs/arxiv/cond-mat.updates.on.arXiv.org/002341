Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) thin films were fabricated on amorphous nonconductive and FTO conductive
glass substrates starting from iron acetate nanoparticles by the doctor blade and the spin coating
techniques. Thin films of Fe2O3 with and without the PEG binder were investigated. Films were subsequently
annealed at 500 0C in air for 1 hour to crystallize the phase Fe2O3. The structural and chemical properties
of Fe2O3 thin films were determined using XRD and FTIR. According to XRD, the single phase of Fe2O3
crystallized in the thin film after annealing. The optical band gap of synthesized Fe2O3 thin films
were determined by UV-Visible spectrums. Gas sensitivity, respond time and recovery time of Fe2O3
thin films were measured in 1000ppm of CO2 gas using AUTO LAB. Thin films synthesized by the doctor
blade method were thicker and more uniform than the thin films prepared by the spin coating technique.
Gas sensitivity of Fe2O3 films synthesized by the doctor blade method is slightly higher than that
of the films fabricated by the spin coating technique. Fe2O3 films with the PEG binder posses a higher
gas sensitivity, lower respond time and lower recovery time compared to films without PEG binder.
After adding the PEG binder, the optical band gap of Fe2O3 thin films reduces. The reduction of the
activation energy is the reason for the improvement of the gas sensitivity after adding the PEG.
However, the peak positions of FTIR do not indicate any significant change due to the adding of the
PEG. Adding the binder increased the gas sensitivity of iron oxide by 15.44%. Both FTIR and UV-Visible
data confirm the formation of Fe2O3 in the thin film.
