Computational studies of chemical reactions in complex environments such as proteins, nanostructures,
or on surfaces require accurate and efficient atomistic models applicable to the nanometer scale.
In general, an accurate parametrization of the atomistic entities will not be available for arbitrary
system classes, but demands a fast automated system-focused parametrization procedure to be quickly
applicable, reliable, flexible, and reproducible. Here, we develop and combine an automatically
parametrizable quantum chemically derived molecular mechanics model with machine-learned corrections
under autonomous uncertainty quantification and refinement. Our approach first generates an
accurate, physically motivated model from a minimum energy structure and its corresponding Hessian
matrix by a partial Hessian fitting procedure of the force constants. This model is then the starting
point to generate a large number of configurations for which additional off-minimum reference
data can be evaluated on the fly. A $\Delta$-machine learning model is trained on these data to provide
a correction to energies and forces including uncertainty estimates. During the procedure, the
flexibility of the machine learning model is tailored to the amount of available training data.
The parametrization of large systems is enabled by a fragmentation approach. Due to their modular
nature, all model construction steps allow for model improvement in a rolling fashion. Our approach
may also be employed for the generation of system-focused electrostatic molecular mechanics embedding
environments in a quantum mechanical molecular-mechanical hybrid model for arbitrary atomistic
structures at the nanoscale.
