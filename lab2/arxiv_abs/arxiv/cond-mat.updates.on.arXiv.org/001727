The structural, dielectric and ferroelectric properties of lead-free (Na0.5-xKxBi0.5-xLax)TiO3
powders synthesized by sol-gel self-combustion method were investigated. Rietveld refinement
of Synchrotron x-ray diffraction data confirms pure single phase rhombohedral crystal structure
with R3c space group for all the compositions and anti-phase octahedral tilting angle decreased
with increase in composition x. Homogeneity and elemental proportions were confirmed by Energy
dispersive x-ray spectrometry. The temperature-dependent dielectric study has shown two diffuse
type of dielectric anomaly for all the samples, due to A-site disorder in the lattice, which has been
assigned to two-has transitions: ferroelectric to anti-ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric
to the paraelectric phase transition. The transition temperature of these phase transitions is
found to decrease as a function of composition. Thermal stability range of dielectric constant
increases from ~100C to 220C as a function of composition. Stable dielectric constant first increases,
from 1557 10 % for parent compound, with the composition, highest for 6 % composition with emid ~ 2508
10 % for the temperature range ~180 C to 340C and after that decreases to 1608 10 % for 12 % but remain
higher than the parent compound Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3. Ferroelectric measurements have shown monotonously
decreasing coercive field as a function of the composition due to a decrease in grain size, confirmed
by microstructural studies using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope. Exponential increases
in the energy storage efficiency from ~ 17 % to 87 % as a function of composition have also observed.
These types of materials, with stable high dielectric constant and low tan delta, have a vast scope
in the field of the thermally stable dielectric constant materials and energy storage applications.
