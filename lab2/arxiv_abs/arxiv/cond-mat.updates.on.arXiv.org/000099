We extend our previously developed coarse-graining strategy for linear polymers with a tunable
number n of effective atoms (blobs) per chain [D'Adamo et al., J. Chem. Phys. 137, 4901 (2012)] to
polymer systems in thermal crossover between the good-solvent and the Theta regimes. We consider
the thermal crossover in the region in which tricritical effects can be neglected, i.e. not too close
to the Theta point, for a wide range of chain volume fractions Phi=c/c* (c* is the overlap concentration),
up to Phi=30. Scaling crossover functions for global properties of the solution are obtained by
Monte-Carlo simulations of the Domb-Joyce model. They provide the input data to develop a minimal
coarse-grained model with four blobs per chain. As in the good-solvent case, the coarse-grained
model potentials are derived at zero density, thus avoiding the inconsistencies related to the
use of state-dependent potentials. We find that the coarse-grained model reproduces the properties
of the underlying system up to some reduced density which increases when lowering the temperature
towards the Theta state. Close to the lower-temperature crossover boundary, the tetramer model
is accurate at least up to Phi<10, while near the good-solvent regime reasonably accurate results
are obtained up to Phi<2. The density region in which the coarse-grained model is predictive
can be enlarged by developing coarse-grained models with more blobs per chain. We extend the strategy
used in the good-solvent case to the crossover regime. This requires a proper treatment of the length
rescalings as before, but also a proper temperature redefinition as the number of blobs is increased.
The case n=10 is investigated. Comparison with full-monomer results shows that the density region
in which accurate predictions can be obtained is significantly wider than that corresponding to
the n=4 case.
