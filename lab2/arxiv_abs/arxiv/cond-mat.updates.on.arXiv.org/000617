In this paper a theoretical studies of the space separation of electron and hole wave functions in
the quantum well ZnO/Mg(0.27)Zn(0.73)O are presented. For this aim the self-consistent solution
of the Schrodinger equations for electrons and holes and the Poisson equations at the presence of
spatially varying quantum well potential due to the piezoelectric effect and local exchange-correlation
potential is found. The one-dimensional Poisson equation contains the Hartree potential which
includes the one-dimensional charge density for electrons and holes along the polarization field
distribution. The three-dimensional Poisson equation contains besides the one-dimensional
charge density for electrons and holes the exchange-correlation potential which is built on convolutions
of a plane-wave part of wave functions in addition. The shifts of the Hartree valence band spectrums
and the conduction band spectrum with respect to the flat band spectrums as well as the Hartree-Fock
band spectrums with respect to the Hartree ones are found. An overlap integrals of the wave functions
of holes and electron with taking into account besides the piezoelectric effects the exchange-correlation
effects in addition is greater than an overlap integral of Hartree ones. The Hartree particles distribute
greater on edges of quantum well than Hartree-Fock particles. It is found that an effective mass
of heavy hole of Mg(0.27)Zn(0.73)O under biaxial strain is greater than an effective-mass of heavy
hole of ZnO. It is calculated that an electron mass is less than a hole mass. It is found that the exciton
binding energy is grater than the localization range particle-hole pair, and the excitons may be
spontaneously created.
