The central question in the field of 2D materials is how a material behaves when it is patterned at
nanometer scale with different edge geometries. Due to the anisotropy inherent in the puckered
structure, black phosphorene nanostructures may have more varieties of edge geometries. Here,
we present a comprehensive 2D planar crystallographic characterization of phosphorene uniformly
by a chiral vector (angle), from which a new type of edge atomic configuration, the slope edge geometry
is discovered. The phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with slope edges, like previously noticed zigzag
and skewed-armchair PNRs, also own interesting twofold-degenerate edge states. These three marginal
directions, together with the skewed-zigzag and armchair directions without edge states, divide
a phosphorene into four regions among which the electronic property is different from each other.
Further, for a PNR cutting along any possible direction, by taking into account the z-direction
in structure, whether or not it owns edge states depends on the periodic zigzag-like morphology
along the edges. Moreover, we propose a PNR-based z-shaped homogenous junction with scale $\sim$100
nm, where the central scattering region between two PNR electrodes is a phosphorene quantum dot
(PQD) of PNR segment with various edge morphologies. Interestingly, the calculated conductance
of the junction relies sensitively on the central PQD edge states, which exhibits a terrace with
resonant oscillations near Fermi energy, otherwise the electron transport is blocked due to the
absence of edge states. Remarkably, the number of oscillating peaks exactly matches to the number
of sawtooth along an edge of PQD, since the discrete energy levels of the zigzag-like edge provide
the transporting channels for electrons. The results here may be extended to the group-VA 2D materials
for observing the electronic property of nanostructures.
