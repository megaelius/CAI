The observation of novel physical phenomena such as Hofstadter's butterfly, topological currents
and unconventional superconductivity in graphene have been enabled by the replacement of SiO$_2$
with hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) as a substrate and by the ability to form superlattices in graphene/hBN
heterostructures. These devices are commonly made by etching the graphene into a Hall-bar shape
with metal contacts. The deposition of metal electrodes, the design and specific configuration
of contacts can have profound effects on the electronic properties of the devices possibly even
affecting the alignment of graphene/hBN superlattices. In this work we probe the strain configuration
of graphene on hBN contacted with two types of metal contacts, two-dimensional (2D) top-contacts
and one-dimensional (1D) edge-contacts. We show that top-contacts induce strain in the graphene
layer along two opposing leads, leading to a complex strain pattern across the device channel. Edge-contacts,
on the contrary, do not show such strain pattern. A finite-elements modelling simulation is used
to confirm that the observed strain pattern is generated by the mechanical action of the metal contacts
clamped to the graphene. Thermal annealing is shown to reduce the overall doping whilst increasing
the overall strain, indicating and increased interaction between graphene and hBN. Surprisingly,
we find that the two contacts configurations lead to different twist-angles in graphene/hBN superlattices,
which converge to the same value after thermal annealing. This observation confirms the self-locking
mechanism of graphene/hBN superlattices also in the presence of strain gradients. Our experiments
may have profound implications in the development of future electronic devices based on heterostructures
and provide a new mechanism to induce complex strain patterns in 2D materials.
