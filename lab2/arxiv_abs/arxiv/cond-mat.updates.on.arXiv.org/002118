We derive a systematic high-frequency expansion for the equations of motion of both closed and open
classical systems under a periodic drive. For classical systems, known approaches based on the
Floquet theorem fail due to the nonlinearity in equations of motion (EOMs) in contrast to quantum
systems. Here, employing a master-equation approach, we overcome this difficulty, successfully
extending the Floquet methodology to classical EOMs to obtain their high-frequency expansions.
Our method is applicable to a broad class of classical and quantum systems described by nonlinear
stochastic differential equations including the Langevin equation, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation,
the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG)
equation. We illustrate our method by examples of the Kapitza pendulum with friction and laser-driven
magnets described by the sLLG equation, confirming that the effective EOMs obtained from their
high-frequency expansions well approximate the original time-dependent EOMs. Remarkably, the
former EOMs are found to agree well with the latter ones not only in a short time but also for a long time
up to the non-equilibrium steady states. This agreement indicates that the high-frequency expansion
for a classical dissipative system is, at least asymptotically, convergent in stark contrast to
that for an isolated system, provided that the dissipation is sufficiently strong. In the example
of driven magnets, we demonstrate the controlled generations of a macroscopic magnetization and
a spin chirality by laser and discuss possible applications to spintronics.
