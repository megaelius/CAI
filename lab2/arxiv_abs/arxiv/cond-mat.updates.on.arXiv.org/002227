Hydrodynamics is a theory of long-range excitations controlled by equations of motion that encode
the conservation of a set of currents (energy, momentum, charge, etc.) associated with explicitly
realized global symmetries. If a system possesses additional weakly broken symmetries, the low-energy
hydrodynamic degrees of freedom also couple to a few other "approximately conserved" quantities
with parametrically long relaxation times. It is often useful to consider such approximately conserved
operators and corresponding new massive modes within the low-energy effective theory, which we
refer to as quasihydrodynamics. Examples of quasihydrodynamics are numerous, with the most transparent
among them hydrodynamics with weakly broken translational symmetry. Here, we show how a number
of other theories, normally not thought of in this context, can also be understood within a broader
framework of quasihydrodynamics: in particular, the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theory and magnetohydrodynamics
coupled to dynamical electric fields. While historical formulations of quasihydrodynamic theories
were typically highly phenomenological, here, we develop a holographic formalism to systematically
derive such theories from a (microscopic) dual gravitational description. Beyond laying out a
general holographic algorithm, we show how the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theory can be understood
from a dual higher-derivative gravity theory and magnetohydrodynamics from a dual theory with
two-form bulk fields. In the latter example, this allows us to unambiguously demonstrate the existence
of dynamical photons in the holographic description of magnetohydrodynamics.
