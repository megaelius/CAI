A constant supply of oxygen has been assumed to be necessary for the growth of titanium nanoparticles
by sputtering. This oxygen supply can arise from a high background pressure in the vacuum system
or from a purposely supplied gas. The supply of oxygen makes it difficult to grow metallic nanoparticles
of titanium and can cause process problems by reacting with the target. We here report that growth
of titanium nanoparticles in the metallic hexagonal titanium ({\alpha}Ti) phase is possible using
a pulsed hollow cathode sputter plasma and adding a high partial pressure of helium to the process
instead of trace amounts of oxygen. The helium cools the process gas in which the nanoparticles nucleate.
This is important both for the first dimer formation and the continued growth to a thermodynamically
stable size. The parameter region where the synthesis of nanoparticles is possible is mapped out
experimentally and the theory of the physical processes behind this process window is outlined.
A pressure limit below which no nanoparticles were produced was found at 200 Pa, and could be attributed
to a low dimer formation rate, mainly caused by a more rapid dilution of the growth material. Nanoparticle
production also disappeared at argon gas flows above 25 sccm. In this case the main reason was identified
as a gas temperature increase within the nucleation zone, giving a too high evaporation rate from
nanoparticles (clusters) in the stage of growth from dimers to stable nuclei. These two mechanisms
are in depth explored in a companion paper [1]. A process stability limit was also found at low argon
gas partial pressures, and could be attributed to a transition from a hollow cathode discharge to
a glow discharge.
