Ultrashort light pulses allow real-time observation and direct control of non-equilibrium dynamics
in low-dimensional systems to explore many-body physics that could be harnessed to design novel
optoelectronic devices. As an emerging two-dimensional (2D) material, pentagonal palladium
diselenide (PdSe2) possesses unconventionally high air stability, making it a promising candidate
for next-generation optoelectronic devices. It is therefore desirable to understand its optical
properties on ultrashort timescales and in a broadenergy range. Here we report on the use of 35 fs
laser pulses to coherently drive and visualize the ultrafast dynamics of excited carriers, excitons,
and phonons in few-layer PdSe2 based on broadband transient absorption spectroscopy spanning
from the visible to the near-infrared. At high carrier densities, we observe a dramatic energy redshift
of the main exciton transition of over 180 meV, indicating the presence of a giant bandgap renormalization
which we attribute to strong screening provided by the photoexcited carriers. Additionally, we
simultaneously visualize in real time two types of atomic oscillations, triggered by ultrashort
light pulses, that couple preferentially to different types of electronic excitations: the intralayer
(4.3 THz) coherent atomic motions to carriers and the interlayer (0.35 THz) motions to excitons.
Combining Raman spectroscopy with first principles calculations, we identify the interplay between
atomic vibrations and charge distribution as the microscopic mechanism driving these coherent
interactions. Our findings provide direct insight and control into the many-body physics and non-equilibrium
properties of free carriers, excitons, and phonons simultaneously, and therefore open new routes
to concurrently manipulate electronic, optical, and vibrational properties of functional materials
on the femtosecond timescale.
