Surface diffusion of small adsorbates is analyzed in terms of the so-called intermediate scattering
function and dynamic structure factor, observables in experiments using the well-known quasielastic
Helium atom scattering and Helium spin echo techniques. The linear theory used is an extension of
the neutron scattering due to van Hove and considers the time evolution of the position of the adsorbates
in the surface. This approach allows us to use a stochastic trajectory description following the
classical, quantum and Bohmian frameworks. Three regimes of motion are clearly identified in the
diffusion process: ballistic, Brownian and intermediate which are well characterized, for the
first two regimes, through the mean square displacements and Einstein relation for the diffusion
constant. The Langevin formalism is used by considering Ohmic friction, moderate surface temperatures
and small coverages. In the Bohmian framework, the starting point is the so-called Schr\"odinger-Langevin
equation which is a nonlinear, logarithmic differential equation. By assuming a Gaussian function
for the probability density, the corresponding quantum stochastic trajectories are given by a
dressing scheme consisting of a classical stochastic trajectory of the center of the Gaussian wave
packet, issued from solving the Langevin equation (particle property), plus the time evolution
of its width governed by the damped Pinney differential equation (wave property). The velocity
autocorrelation function is the same as the classical one when the initial spread rate is assumed
to be zero. If not, in the diffusion regime, the Brownian-Bohmian motion shows a weak anomalous diffusion.
