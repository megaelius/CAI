In this paper we study the main surface characteristics which control the foamability of solutions
of various surfactants. Experiments with anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants with different
head groups and chain lengths are performed in a wide concentration range, from 0.001 mM to 100 mM.
The electrolyte concentration is also varied from 0 up to 100 mM. For all surfactants studied, three
regions in the dependence of the foamability, VA, on the logarithm of surfactant concentration,
lgCS, are observed. In Region 1, VA is very low and depends weakly on CS. In Region 2, VA increases steeply
with CS. In Region 3, VA reaches a plateau. A key new element in our interpretation of the foaming data
is that we use the surface tension measurements to determine the dependence of the main surface properties
(surfactant adsorption, surface coverage and surface elasticity) on the surface age of the bubbles.
In this way we interpret the results from the foaming tests by considering the properties of the dynamic
adsorption layers, formed during foaming. The data for the nonionic and ionic surfactants merge
around two master curves when plotted as a function of the surface coverage, the surface mobility
factor, or the Gibbs elasticity of the dynamic adsorption layers. This difference between the ionic
and nonionic surfactants is explained with the important contribution of the electrostatic repulsion
between the foam film surfaces for the ionic surfactants which stabilizes the dynamic foam films
even at moderate surface coverage and at relatively high ionic strength. In contrast, the films
formed from solutions of nonionic surfactants are stabilized via steric repulsion which becomes
sufficiently high to prevent bubble coalescence only at rather high surface coverage (> 90 %) which
corresponds to related high Gibbs elasticity (> 150 mN/m) and low surface mobility of the dynamic
adsorption layers.
