We study the light-cone and front dynamics of a single particle continuous time extended quantum
walk on a one dimensional lattice with finite range hopping. We show that, in general, for an initially
localized state, propagating wave fronts can be characterized as ordinary or extremal fronts with
the latter exhibiting an anomalous sub-diffusive scaling behaviour in the front region. We investigate
the dynamical global and local scaling properties of the cumulative probability distribution
function for the extended walk with nearest and next-nearest neighbour hopping using analytical
and numerical methods. The global scaling shows the existence of a 'causal light-cone' corresponding
to excitations travelling with a velocity smaller than a maximal 'light velocity'. Maximal fronts
moving with fixed 'light velocity' bound the causal cone. The front regions spread with time sub-diffusively
exhibiting a local Airy scaling which leads to an internal staircase structure. At a certain critical
next-nearest neighbour hopping strength, there is a transition from a phase with one 'causal cone'
to a phase with two nested 'causal cones' and the existence of an internal staircase structure in
the corresponding cumulative distribution profiles. We also connect the study to that in spin chain
systems and indicate that a single particle quantum walk on the one dimensional lattice already
captures the many body physics of a spin chain system. In particular, we suggest that the time evolution
of a single particle quantum walk on the one dimensional lattice with an initially localized state
is equivalent to the time evolution of a domain wall initial state in a corresponding spin chain system.
