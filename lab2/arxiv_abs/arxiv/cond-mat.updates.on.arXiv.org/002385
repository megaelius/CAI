The interaction of dislocations with phase boundaries is a complex phenomenon, that is far from
being fully understood. A 2D Peierls-Nabarro finite element (PN-FE) model for studying edge dislocation
transmission across fully coherent and non-damaging phase boundaries was recently proposed.
This paper brings a new dimension to the complexity by extending the PN-FE model with a dedicated
cohesive zone model for the phase boundary. With the proposed model, a natural interplay between
dislocations, external boundaries and the phase boundary, including decohesion of that boundary,
is provided. It allows one to study the competition between dislocation transmission and phase
boundary decohesion. Commonly, the interface potentials required for glide plane behaviour and
phase boundary decohesion are established through atomistic simulations. They are corresponding
to the misfit energy intrinsic to a system of two bulks of atoms that are translated rigidly with respect
to each other. It is shown that the blind utilisation of these potentials in zero-thickness interfaces
(as used in the proposed model) may lead to a large quantitative error. Accordingly, for physical
consistency, the potentials need to be reduced towards zero-thickness potentials. In this paper
a linear elastic reduction is adopted. With the reduced potentials for the glide plane and the phase
boundary, the competition between dislocation transmission and phase boundary decohesion is
studied for an 8-dislocation pile-up system. Results reveal a strong influence of the phase contrast
in material properties as well as the phase boundary toughness on the outcome of this competition.
In the case of crack nucleation, the crack length shows an equally strong dependency on these properties.
