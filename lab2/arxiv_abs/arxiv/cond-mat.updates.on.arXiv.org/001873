In the synthesis of different materials, it is ambiguous to understand structure evolution. The
electron-dynamics of amalgamated certain solid atoms in their respective format under appreciable
attained dynamics originate the type of structure. This study deals structure evolution of those
atoms which deal conservative forces for execution of electron-dynamics. Such atoms when in the
neutral state transform heat energy into bind energy depending on the mode of electron-dynamics.
In surface format, atoms deal amalgamation and binding at typical-leveled ground surface. In space
format, atoms deal amalgamation and binding just at above typical-leveled ground surface. In grounded
format, atoms deal amalgamation and binding at below typical-leveled ground surface. Amalgamating
atoms under suitable attained dynamics for relevant format result into evolve structure of different
dimensions where binding energy of different shape is configured on exerting conservative forces
to their electrons for relevant poles. In addition to one- and two-dimension, a four-dimension
structure is also evolved in atoms of surface format. Atoms bind at the points of configured energy
because of the same nature of configured energy. Amalgamated atoms bind from point of configured
energy laterally to the point or points of configured energy of targeted atom but from the upward-side
in structure evolution of space format, atoms bind laterally from downward-side in structure evolution
of grounded format and atoms bind adjacently in structure evolution of surface format. A mixed-dimension
structure evolves under frustrated amalgamation of atoms depending on the process conditions.
This fundamental revolution in the approach that how structure of different solid atoms evolves
when dealing conservative forces for dynamics of electrons which may shed a new light in the existing
state of materials science.
