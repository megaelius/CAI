We study the Hamiltonian dynamics of the spherical spin model with fully-connected two-body interactions
drawn from a Gaussian probability distribution. In the statistical physics framework, the potential
energy is of the so-called $p=2$ spherical disordered kind. Most importantly for our setting, the
energy conserving dynamics are equivalent to the ones of the Neumann integrable system. We take
initial conditions in thermal equilibrium and we subsequently evolve the configurations with
Newton dynamics dictated by a different Hamiltonian. We identify three dynamical phases depending
on the parameters that characterise the initial state and the final Hamiltonian. We obtain the {\it
global} dynamical observables with numerical and analytic methods and we show that, in most cases,
they are out of thermal equilibrium. We note, however, that for shallow quenches from the condensed
phase the dynamics are close to (though not at) thermal equilibrium. Surprisingly enough, for a
particular relation between parameters the global observables comply Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium.
We next set the analysis of the system with finite number of degrees of freedom in terms of $N$ non-linearly
coupled modes. We evaluate the mode temperatures and we relate them to the frequency-dependent
effective temperature measured with the fluctuation-dissipation relation in the frequency domain,
similarly to what was recently proposed for quantum integrable cases. Finally, we analyse the $N-1$
integrals of motion and we use them to show that the system is out of equilibrium in all phases, even
for parameters that show an apparent Gibbs-Boltzmann behaviour of global observables. We elaborate
on the role played by these constants of motion in the post-quench dynamics and we briefly discuss
the possible description of the asymptotic dynamics in terms of a Generalised Gibbs Ensemble.
