Quantum bits (qubits) with long coherence times are an important element for the implementation
of medium- and large-scale quantum computers. In the case of superconducting planar qubits, understanding
and improving qubits' quality can be achieved by studying superconducting planar resonators.
In this Paper, we fabricate and characterize coplanar waveguide resonators made from aluminum
thin films deposited on silicon substrates. We perform three different substrate treatments prior
to aluminum deposition: One chemical treatment based on a hydrofluoric acid clean, one physical
treatment consisting of a thermal annealing at 880 degree Celsius in high vacuum, one combined treatment
comprising both the chemical and the physical treatments. We first characterize the fabricated
samples through cross-sectional tunneling electron microscopy acquiring electron energy loss
spectroscopy maps of the samples' cross sections. These measurements show that both the chemical
and the physical treatments almost entirely remove native silicon oxide from the substrate surface
and that their combination results in the cleanest interface. We then study the quality of the resonators
by means of microwave measurements in the "quantum regime", i.e., at a temperature T~10 mK and at
a mean microwave photon number $\langle n_{\textrm{ph}} \rangle \sim 1$. In this regime, we find
that both surface treatments independently improve the resonator's intrinsic quality factor
and that the highest quality factor is obtained for the combined treatment, $Q_{\textrm{i}} \sim
0.8$ million. Finally, we find that the TLS quality factor averaged over a time period of 3 h is $\sim
3$ million at $\langle n_{\textrm{ph}} \rangle \sim 10$, indicating that substrate surface engineering
can potentially reduce the TLS loss below other losses such as quasiparticle and vortex loss.
