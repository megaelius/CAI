Kondo physics in doped monolayer graphene is predicted to exhibit unusual features due to the linear
vanishing of the pristine material's density of states at the Dirac point. Despite several attempts,
conclusive experimental observation of the phenomenon remains elusive. One likely obstacle to
identification is a very small Kondo temperature scale $T_K$ in situations where the chemical potential
lies near the Dirac point. We propose tailored mechanical deformations of monolayer graphene as
a means of revealing unique fingerprints of the Kondo effect. Inhomogeneous strains are known to
produce specific alternating changes in the local density of states (LDOS) away from the Dirac point
that signal sublattice symmetry breaking effects. Small LDOS changes can be amplified in an exponential
increase or decrease of $T_K$ for magnetic impurities attached at different locations. We illustrate
this behavior in two deformation geometries: a circular 'bubble' and a long fold, both described
by Gaussian displacement profiles. We calculate the LDOS changes for modest strains and analyze
the relevant Anderson impurity model describing a magnetic atom adsorbed in either a 'top-site'
or a 'hollow-site' configuration. Numerical renormalization-group solutions of the impurity
model suggest that higher expected $T_K$ values, combined with distinctive spatial patterns under
variation of the point of graphene attachment, make the top-site configuration the more promising
for experimental observation of signatures of the Kondo effect. The strong strain sensitivity
of $T_K$ may lift top-site Kondo physics into the range experimentally accessible using local probes
such as scanning tunneling microscopy.
