When floating on a two-dimensional (2D) surface of superfluid $^{4}$He, electrons arrange themselves
in 2D crystalline structure known as Wigner crystal. In channels, the boundaries interfere the
crystalline order and in case of very narrow channels one observes a quasi-1D Wigner crystal formed
by just a few rows of electrons and, ultimately, one row, i.e., in the ``quantum wire'' regime. Recently,
the ``quantum wire'' regime was accessed experimentally [D. Rees {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 108}, 176801 (2012)] resulting in unusual transport phenomena such as, e.g., oscillations
in the electron conductance. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the nonlinear transport
of electrons in channels with constrictions: single and multiple symmetric and asymmetric geometrical
constrictions with varying width and length, and saddle-point-type potentials with varying gate
voltage. We analyze the average particle velocity versus driving force or the gate voltage. We have
revealed a significant difference in the dynamics for long and short constrictions: the oscillations
of the average particle velocity for the systems with short constrictions exhibit a clear correlation
with the transitions between the states with different numbers of rows of particles while for longer
constrictions these oscillations are suppressed. The obtained results are in agreement with the
experimental observations. We proposed a FET-like structure that consists of a channel with asymmetric
constrictions. We show that applying a transverse bias results either in increase of the average
particle velocity or in its suppression thus allowing a flexible control tool over the electron
transport. Our results bring important insights into the dynamics of electrons floating on the
surface of superfluid $^{4}$He in channels with constrictions and allow an effective control over
the electron transport.
