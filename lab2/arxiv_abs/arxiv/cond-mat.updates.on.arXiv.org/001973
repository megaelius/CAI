Using particle-scale simulations of non-suspended sediment transport for a large range of Newtonian
fluids driving transport, including air and water, we determine the bulk transport cessation threshold
$\Theta^r_t$ by extrapolating the transport load as a function of the dimensionless fluid shear
stress (`Shields number') $\Theta$ to the vanishing transport limit. In this limit, the simulated
steady states of continuous transport can be described by simple analytical model equations relating
the average transport layer properties to the law of the wall flow velocity profile. We use this model
to calculate $\Theta^r_t$ for arbitrary environments and derive a general Shields-like threshold
diagram in which a Stokes-like number replaces the particle Reynolds number. Despite the simplicity
of our hydrodynamic description, the predicted cessation threshold, both from the simulations
and analytical model, quantitatively agrees with measurements for transport in air and viscous
and turbulent liquids despite not being fitted to these measurements. We interpret the analytical
model as a description of a continuous rebound motion of transported particles and thus $\Theta^r_t$
as the minimal fluid shear stress needed to compensate the average energy loss of transported particles
during an average rebound at the bed surface. This interpretation, supported by simulations near
$\Theta^r_t$, implies that entrainment mechanisms are needed to sustain transport above $\Theta^r_t$.
While entrainment by turbulent events sustains intermittent transport, entrainment by particle-bed
impacts sustains continuous transport. Combining our interpretations with the critical energy
criterion for incipient motion by Valyrakis and coworkers, we put forward a new conceptual picture
of sediment transport intermittency.
