The non-local van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) has had tremendous success since its inception
in 2004 due to its constraint-based formalism that is rigorously derived from a many-body starting
point. However, while vdW-DF can describe binding energies and structures for van der Waals complexes
and mixed systems with good accuracy, one long-standing criticism---also since its inception---has
been that the $C_6$ coefficients that derive from the vdW-DF framework are largely inaccurate and
can be wrong by more than a factor of two. It has long been thought that this failure to describe the
$C_6$ coefficients is a conceptual flaw of the underlying plasmon framework used to derive vdW-DF.
We prove here that this is not the case and that accurate $C_6$ coefficient can be obtained without
sacrificing the accuracy at binding separations from a modified framework that is fully consistent
with the constraints and design philosophy of the original vdW-DF formulation. Our design exploits
a degree of freedom in the plasmon-dispersion model $\omega_{\mathbf{q}}$, modifying the strength
of the long-range van der Waals interaction and the cross-over from long to short separations, with
additional parameters tuned_ to reference systems. Testing the new formulation for a range of different
systems, we not only confirm the greatly improved description of $C_6$ coefficients, but we also
find excellent performance for molecular dimers and other systems. The importance of this development
is not necessarily that particular aspects such as $C_6$ coefficients or binding energies are improved,
but rather that our finding opens the door for further conceptual developments of an entirely unexplored
direction within the exact same constrained-based non-local framework that made vdW-DF so successful
in the first place.
