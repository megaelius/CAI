Graphene devices for analog and RF applications are prone to Low Frequency Noise (LFN) due to its
upconversion to undesired phase noise at higher frequencies. Such applications demand the use
of short channel graphene transistors that operate at high electric fields in order to ensure a high
speed. Electric field is inversely proportional to device length and proportional to channel potential
so it gets maximized as the drain voltage increases and the transistor length shrinks. Under these
conditions though, short channel effects like Velocity Saturation (VS) should be taken into account.
Carrier number and mobility fluctuations have been proved to be the main sources that generate LFN
in graphene devices. While their contribution to the bias dependence of LFN in long channels has
been thoroughly investigated, the way in which VS phenomenon affects LFN in short channel devices
under high drain voltage conditions has not been well understood. At low electric field operation,
VS effect is negligible since carriers velocity is far away from being saturated. Under these conditions,
LFN can be precicely predicted by a recently established physics-based analytical model. The present
paper goes a step furher and proposes a new model which deals with the contribution of VS effect on
LFN under high electric field conditions. The implemented model is validated with novel experimental
data, published for the first time, from CVD grown back-gated single layer graphene transistors
operating at gigahertz frequencies. The model accurately captures the reduction of LFN especially
near charge neutrality point because of the effect of VS mechanism. Moreover, an analytical expression
for the effect of contact resistance on LFN is derived. This contact resistance contribution is
experimentally shown to be dominant at higher gate voltages and is accurately described by the proposed
model.
