We critically review the literature on the Debye absorption peak of liquid water and the excess response
found on the high frequency side of the Debye peak. We find a lack of agreement on the microscopic phenomena
underlying both of these features. To better understand the molecular origin of Debye peak we ran
large scale molecular dynamics simulations and performed several different distance-dependent
decompositions of the low frequency dielectric spectra, finding that it involves processes that
take place on scales of 1.5-2.0 nm. We also calculated the $k$-dependence of the Debye relaxation,
finding it to be highly dispersive. These findings are inconsistent with models that relate Debye
relaxation to local processes such as the rotation/translation of molecules after H-bond breaking.
We introduce the spectrumfitter Python package for fitting dielectric spectra and analyze different
ways of fitting the high frequency excess, such as including one or two additional Debye peaks. We
propose using the generalized Lydanne-Sachs-Teller (gLST) equation as a way of testing the physicality
of model dielectric functions. Our attempts at fitting the experimental spectrum using the gLST
relation as a constraint indicate that the traditional way of fitting the excess response with secondary
and tertiary Debye relaxations is problematic. All of our work is consistent with the recent theory
of Popov et al. (2016) that Debye relaxation is due to the migration of Bjerrum-like defects in the
hydrogen bond network. Under this theory, the mechanism of Debye relaxation in liquid water is similar
to the mechanism in ice, but the heterogeneity and power-law dynamics of the H-bond network in water
results in excess response on the high frequency side of the peak.
