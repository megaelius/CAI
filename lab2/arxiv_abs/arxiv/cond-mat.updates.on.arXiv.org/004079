Viscoelastic silicone rubber (VSR) is a remarkable shape-memory solid. The material's polymer
network retains a memory of its shape history, so its current and future shapes depend strikingly
on its past shapes. Although VSR's memory fades gradually and it has a permanent (cured-in) shape
to which it will eventually return when left alone, VSR can be taught new shapes and retain them for
significant lengths of time. To examine VSR's ability to learn, remember, and recover shapes, this
work focuses on a simple experiment. A VSR that has relaxed into its permanent shape is suddenly compressed
to about 80% of its original height. After a specific period of compression, the VSR is released and
allowed to return to its permanent shape. Having learned a new shape during the compression period,
however, the VSR is reluctant to return and takes seconds, minutes, or hours to do so, depending on
how long it was compressed. In addition to observing these behaviors experimentally in VSR, we show
that those behaviors are well-described by the Fractional Zener model. That model involves time
derivatives of non-integer order and those generalized time derivatives have memory. Both VSR
and the Fractional Zener model describing it are acutely aware of the past. The model's mathematical
machinery make it possible to design VSR behaviors based on physical parameters, although some
of the model's relationships are not yet known in closed form. VSR's existence as a practical material
means that devices can be designed and produced that use a memory of past shapes to do things that would
otherwise be difficult or impossible to make.
