Simulation techniques are providing with each passing day a deeper insight into the structure and
properties of materials. Two main obstacles appear for the cooperation of simulation and experiment:
on the one hand, the frequent lack of a degree of uncertainty associated with calculated data. On
the other, the concomitant underlying feeling that calculation parameters can be tuned with the
explicit aim of matching the experimental results, even at the expense of the quality of the simulation.
Without the definition of an error bar for estimating the precision of the calculation, direct comparison
of calculated and experimental data can lack physical significance. In this contribution, we employ
the well known delocalization error of DFT and HF to develop a simple and robust procedure to quickly
estimate an error bar for calculated quantities in the field of solid state chemistry. First, we
validate our model on one of the simplest properties of a solid, the geometry of its unit cell, which
can be determined experimentally with high accuracy. In this case, our computational window is
too large to provide a useful error bar. However, it provides computational material scientists
with a pointer on how much a given system is affected by the method of choice, i.e. how much it is sensible
to parameter tuning and how much care should be taken in doing it. Then, we move to another quantity
which has a greater experimental uncertainty, namely transition pressure, and show that our approach
can lead to error bars comparable to experiment. Hence, both experiment and theory can be compared
on an even basis taking into account the uncertainty introduced by the scientist, both in the measuring
conditions and the tuning of computational parameters.
