In order to fully understand nanoscale heat transport it is necessary to spectrally characterize
phonon transmission in nanostructures. Towards this goal we have developed a microfabricated
phonon spectrometer. We utilize microfabricated superconducting tunnel junction-based (STJ)
phonon transducers for the emission and detection of tunable, non-thermal, and spectrally resolved
acoustic phonons, with frequencies ranging from ~100 to ~870 GHz, in silicon microstructures.
We show that phonon spectroscopy with STJs offers a spectral resolution of ~15-20 GHz, which is ~20
times better than thermal conductance measurements, for probing nanoscale phonon transport.
The STJs are Al-AlxOy-Al tunnel junctions and phonon emission and detection occurs via quasiparticle
excitation and decay transitions that occur in the superconducting films. We elaborate on the design
geometry and constraints of the spectrometer, the fabrication techniques, and the low-noise instrumentation
that are essential for successful application of this technique for nanoscale phonon studies.
We discuss the spectral distribution of phonons emitted by an STJ emitter and the efficiency of their
detection by an STJ detector. We demonstrate that the phonons propagate ballistically through
a silicon microstructure, and that submicron spatial resolution is realizable in a design such
as ours. Spectrally resolved measurements of phonon transport in nanoscale structures and nanomaterials
will further the engineering and exploitation of phonons, and thus have important ramifications
for nanoscale thermal transport as well as the burgeoning field of nanophononics.
