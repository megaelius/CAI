We discover many new crystalline solid materials with fast single crystal Li ion conductivity at
room temperature, discovered through density functional theory simulations guided by machine
learning-based methods. The discovery of new solid Li superionic conductors is of critical importance
to the development of safe all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. With a predictive universal structure-property
relationship for fast ion conduction not well understood, the search for new solid Li ion conductors
has relied largely on trial-and-error computational and experimental searches over the last several
decades. In this work, we perform a guided search of materials space with a machine learning (ML)-based
prediction model for material selection and density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD)
simulations for calculating ionic conductivity. These materials are screened from over 12,000
experimentally synthesized and characterized candidates with very diverse structures and compositions.
When compared to a random search of materials space, we find that the ML-guided search is 2.7 times
more likely to identify fast Li ion conductors, with at least a 45x improvement in the log-average
of room temperature Li ion conductivity. The F1 score of the ML-based model is 0.50, 3.5 times better
than the F1 score expected from completely random guesswork. In a head-to-head competition against
six Ph.D. students working in the field, we find that the ML-based model doubles the F1 score of human
experts in its ability to identify fast Li-ion conductors from atomistic structure with a thousand-
fold increase in speed, clearly demonstrating the utility of this model for the research community.
All conducting materials reported here lack transition metals and are predicted to exhibit low
electronic conduction, high stability against oxidation, and high thermodynamic stability.
