The mechanical integrity of composite materials depends primarily on the interface strength and
the defect density of the reinforcement which is the provider of enhanced strength and stiffness.
In the case of graphene/ polymer nanocomposites which are characterized by an extremely large interface
region, any defects in the inclusion (such as folds, cracks, holes etc.) will have a detrimental
effect to the internal strain distribution and the resulting mechanical performance. This conventional
wisdom, however, can be challenged if the defect size is reduced beyond the critical size for crack
formation to the level of atomic vacancies. In that case, there should be no practical effect on crack
propagation and depending on the nature of the vacancies the interface strength may be in fact increase.
In this work we employed argon ion (Ar+) bombardment and subsequent exposure to hydrogen (H2) to
induce (as revealed by X-ray & Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and Raman spectroscopy)
passivated atomic single vacancies to CVD graphene. The modified graphene was subsequently transferred
to PMMA bars and the morphology, wettability and the interface adhesion of the CVD graphene/PMMA
system were investigated with Atomic Force Microscopy technique and Raman analysis. The results
obtained showed clearly an overall improved mechanical behavior of graphene/polymer interface,
since an increase as well a more uniform shift distribution with strain is observed. This paves the
way for interface engineering in graphene/polymer systems which, in pristine condition, suffer
from premature graphene slippage and subsequent failure.
