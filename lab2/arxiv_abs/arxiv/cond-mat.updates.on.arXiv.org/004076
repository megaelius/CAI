Structure evolution in atoms of suitable elements does not show original mechanism of formation.
This study deals with structure evolution in atoms of those elements, which are feasible to execute
confined inter-state electron dynamics. The structure of these atoms gets evolved during amalgamation
due to significantly attained dynamics. Structures evolve in different formats of exerting forces
as per mechanism of electron dynamics in their atoms. In neutral state, atoms transform heat energy
into binding energy having shapes like tick, integral or Gaussian distribution symbol. The shape
of binding energy depends on built-in inter-state gap of atom i.e., its inherent nature. An evolving
structure of atoms having identical ground points deals with forced exertions to suitable electrons
at the same level also. In atoms of space format, the structure evolves above the typical level of
ground surface. In atoms of grounded format, the structure evolves below the typical level of ground
surface. Dimensions of evolving structure depend on number of quadrants of atom feasible to execute
electron dynamics. In the elements where atoms execute electron dynamics for three quadrants,
they show a bit intricate mechanism of structure evolution. An atom binds to the targeted atom at
the points of generated energy. In structure evolution of space format and grounded format, amalgamating
atoms bind to the targeted atom lateral-wise from upward side and downward side, respectively.
In structure of surface format, amalgamated atoms bind to target atom adjacent-wise. In each definite
format, the adhering of mono layers of bound atoms is by means of involved force and engaged energy.
Chemical activity of involved force and engaged energy exploits chemical reactivity to adhere
lateral-wise mono layers of bound atoms. This fundamental revolution related...
