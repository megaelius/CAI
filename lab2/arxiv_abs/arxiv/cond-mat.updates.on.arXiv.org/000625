The bacterial genome is organized in a structure called the nucleoid by a variety of associated proteins.
These proteins can form complexes on DNA that play a central role in various biological processes,
including chromosome segregation. A prominent example is the large ParB-DNA complex, which forms
an essential component of the segregation machinery in many bacteria. ChIP-Seq experiments show
that ParB proteins localize around centromere-like parS sites on the DNA to which ParB binds specifically,
and spreads from there over large sections of the chromosome. Recent theoretical and experimental
studies suggest that DNA-bound ParB proteins can interact with each other to condense into a coherent
3D complex on the DNA. However, the structural organization of this protein-DNA complex remains
unclear, and a predictive quantitative theory for the distribution of ParB proteins on DNA is lacking.
Here, we propose the Looping and Clustering (LC) model, which employs a statistical physics approach
to describe protein-DNA complexes. The LC model accounts for the extrusion of DNA loops from a cluster
of interacting DNA-bound proteins. Conceptually, the structure of the protein-DNA complex is
determined by a competition between attractive protein interactions and the configurational
and loop entropy of this protein-DNA cluster. Indeed, we show that the protein interaction strength
determines the "tightness" of the loopy protein-DNA complex. With this approach we consider the
genomic organization of such a protein-DNA cluster around a single high-affinity binding site.
Thus, our model provides a theoretical framework to quantitatively compute the binding profiles
of ParB-like proteins around a cognate (parS) binding site.
