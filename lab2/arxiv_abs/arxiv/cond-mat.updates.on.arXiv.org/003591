Ultrafast, femtosecond laser pulse interaction with dielectric materials has shown them to have
significantly higher laser fluence threshold requirements, as compared to metals and semiconductors,
for laser material modification, such as laser ablation. Examples of dielectrics are crystalline
materials such as quartz and sapphire, and amorphous glasses. The interaction between femtosecond
laser pulses, at a wavelength with negligible linear absorption, and a dielectric has been found
to be weak, and multiple pulse irradiation is therefore typically used in order to see significant
and quantifiable effects. In this study the dielectric is the crystalline, layered, natural mineral
muscovite, a mica with formula KAl_2 (Si_3 Al) O_10 (OH)_2. Muscovite, newly cleaved, is used in
a wide range of technological and scientific applications including as an insulating material
in electronics and as an ultra-flat and ultra-clean substrate. A single, ~800 nm wavelength, ~6
micron spotsize, ~150 fs laser pulse is found to lead to a systematic range of laser modification
topologies, as a function of the fluence of the single laser pulse, including bulk removal of material.
The fs laser pulse/material interaction is greater than expected for a standard dielectric at a
given fluence. Optical surface profiling and FESEM are used to characterise the topologies. Contrasting
the results of the two techniques supports the use of optical surface profiling to characterise
the material modification despite its limitations in lateral resolution as compared to FESEM.
The interlayer mineral water content of natural muscovite is proposed as the primary reason that
mica behaves differently to a standard dielectric when irradiated with a single 800 nm fs laser pulse.
