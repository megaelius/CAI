In this work we consider two possible wetting states for a droplet when placed on a substrate: the
Fakir configuration of a Cassie-Baxter (CB) state with a droplet residing on top of roughness grooves
and the Wenzel (W) state characterized by the homogeneous wetting of the surface. We extend a theoretical
model based on the global interfacial energies for both states to study the wetting behavior of simple
and double reentrant surfaces. Due to the minimization of the energies associated to each wetting
state, we predict the thermodynamic wetting state of the droplet for a given surface and obtain its
contact angle ${\theta}_C$. We first use this model to find the geometries for pillared, simple
and double reentrant surfaces that most enhances ${\theta}_C$ and conclude that the repellent
behavior of these surfaces is governed by the relation between the height and width of the reentrances.
We compare our results with recent experiments and discuss the limitations of this thermodynamic
approach. To address one of these limitations, we implement Monte Carlo simulations of the cellular
Potts Model in three dimensions, allowing us to investigate the dependency of the wetting state
on the initial state of the droplet. We find that when the droplet is initialized in a CB state, it gets
trapped in a local minimum and stays in the repellent behavior irrespective of the theoretical prediction.
When the initial state is W, simulations show a good agreement with theory for pillared surfaces,
but for reentrant surfaces the agreement only happens in few cases: for most simulated geometries
the contact angle reached by the droplet in simulations is higher than ${\theta}_C$ predicted by
the model. Moreover, we find that the contact angle of the simulated droplet is higher when placed
on the reentrant surfaces than for a pillared surfaces with the same height, width and pillar distance.
