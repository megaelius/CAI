We use large-scale DFT calculations to investigate with unprecedented detail the so-called spin-orbit
(SO) proximity effect in graphene adsorbed on the Pt(111) and Ni(111)/Au semi-infinite surfaces,
previously studied via spin and angle resolved photoemission experiments. The key finding is that,
due to the hybridization with the metal's bands, the Dirac cones manifest an unexpectedly rich spin
texture including out-of-plane and even radial in-plane spin components at (anti-)crossings
where local gap openings and deviations from linearity take place. Both the continuum character
of the metallic bands and the back folding associated to the moir\'e patterns enhance the spin texture
and induce sizeable splittings which, nevertheless, only become giant ($\sim$100 meV) at anti-crossing
regions; that is, where electronic transport is suppressed. At the quasi-linear regions the splitted
bands typically disperse with different broadenings and tend to cross with their magnetization
continuously changing in order to match that at the edges of the upper and lower gaps. As a result,
both the splittings and spin direction become strongly $k$-depedendent. The SO manifests in an
analogous way for the spin-polarized G/Au/Ni(111) system, although here the magnetic exchange
interactions dominate inducing small splittings ($\sim$10 meV) in the $\pi$-bands while the SO
mainly introduces a small Rashba splitting in the Dirac cones as their magnetization acquires a
helical component. We interprete our results as a drawback to the potential development of graphene
based spintronic devices relying on the SO proximity effect.
