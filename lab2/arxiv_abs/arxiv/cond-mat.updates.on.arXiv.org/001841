We present a valence transition model for electron- and hole-doped cuprates, within which there
occurs a discrete jump in ionicity Cu$^{2+} \to$ Cu$^{1+}$ upon doping, at or near optimal doping
in the electron-doped compounds and at the pseudogap phase transition in the hole-doped materials.
Doped cuprates have negative charge-transfer gaps, just as rare earth nickelates and BaBiO$_3$.
Because of strong correlations and small $d-p$ electron hoppings the systems behave as effective
$\frac{1}{2}$-filled Cu-band in the undoped state, and as correlated two-dimensional geometrically
frustrated nearly $\frac{1}{4}$-filled O-band in the doped state. The theory gives the simplest
yet most comprehensive understanding of experiments in the normal states. The robust antiferromagnetism
in the conventional T$^\prime$ crystals, the strong role of oxygen deficiency in driving superconductivity
and charge carrier sign corresponding to holes at optimal doping are all manifestations of the same
quantum state. In the hole-doped pseudogapped state, a biaxial commensurate period 4 charge density
wave state of O$^{1-}$-Cu$^{1+}$-O$^{1-}$ spin-singlets coexists with broken rotational C$_4$
symmetry. Finite domains of this broken symmetry state will exhibit the polar Kerr effect. Superconductivity
within the model results from a destabilization of the $\frac{1}{4}$-filled band paired Wigner
crystal [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 93}, 165110 and {\bf 93}, 205111]. We posit that a similar valence transition,
Ir$^{4+} \to$ Ir$^{3+}$, occurs in electron-doped SrIr$_2$O$_4$. We make testable theoretical
predictions on cuprates and iridates. Finally, we note that there exist an unusually large number
of unconventional superconductors that exhibit superconductivity proximate to exotic charge
ordered states, whose bandfillings are also $\frac{1}{4}$, exactly where the paired Wigner crystal
is most stable.
