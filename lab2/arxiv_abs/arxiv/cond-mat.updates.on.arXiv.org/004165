Thin film oxides are a source of endless fascination for the materials scientist. These materials
are highly flexible, can be integrated into almost limitless combinations, and exhibit many useful
functionalities for device applications. While precision synthesis techniques, such as molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), provide a high degree of control over these
systems, there remains a disconnect between ideal and realized materials. Because thin films adopt
structures and chemistries distinct from their bulk counterparts, it is often difficult to predict
what properties will emerge. The complex energy landscape of the synthesis process is also strongly
influenced by non-equilibrium growth conditions imposed by the substrate, as well as the kinetics
of thin film crystallization and fluctuations in process variables, all of which can lead to significant
deviations from targeted outcomes. High-resolution structural and chemical characterization
techniques, as described in this volume, are needed to verify growth models, bound theoretical
calculations, and guide materials design. While many characterization options exist, most are
spatially-averaged or indirect, providing only partial insight into the complex behavior of these
systems. Over the past several decades, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has
become a cornerstone of oxide heterostructure characterization owing to its ability to simultaneously
resolve structure, chemistry, and defects at the highest spatial resolution. STEM methods are
an essential complement to averaged scattering techniques, offering a direct picture of resulting
materials that can inform and refine the growth process to achieve targeted properties. There is
arguably no other technique that can provide such a broad array of information at the atomic-scale,
all within a single experimental session.
