Scanning probe microscopy is often applied to study electrical forces and sample properties, with
the most widely used experiment being frequency-modulated Kelvin probe force microscopy. The
equations commonly used to interpret this frequency-modulated experiment, however, rely on two
hidden assumptions. The first assumption is that the tip charge oscillates in phase with the cantilever
motion to keep the tip voltage constant. The second assumption is that any changes in the tip-sample
interaction happen slowly. Starting from an electro-mechanical model of the cantilever-sample
interaction, we use Lagrangian mechanics to derive coupled equations of motion for the cantilever
position and charge. This general approach rigorously describes scanned probe experiments even
in the case when the usual assumptions are violated. We develop a Magnus-expansion approximation
to illustrate how abrupt changes in the tip-sample interaction cause abrupt changes in the cantilever
amplitude and phase. We show that feedback-free time-resolved electric force microscopy is only
sensitive to the magnitude of the abrupt change in cantilever phase for sub-cycle sample time constants.
We then use a perturbation-theory approximation to relate cantilever frequency shift and dissipation
to the sample impedance even when tip charge oscillates out of phase with the cantilever motion.
We apply this approximation to determine the cantilever frequency shift and dissipation for an
arbitrary sample impedance in both local dielectric spectroscopy and broadband local dielectric
spectroscopy experiments. The general approaches we develop provide a path forward for rigorously
modeling the coupled motion of the cantilever position and charge in the wide range of electrical
scanned probe microscopy experiments where the hidden assumptions of the conventional equations
are violated or inapplicable.
