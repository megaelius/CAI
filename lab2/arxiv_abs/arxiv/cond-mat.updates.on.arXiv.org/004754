Vortices are expected to exist in a supersolid but experimentally their detection can be difficult
because the vortex cores are localized at positions where the local density is very low. We address
here this problem by performing numerical simulations of a dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)
in a pancake confinement at $T=0$ K and study the effect of quantized vorticity on the phases that
can be realized depending upon the ratio between dipolar and short-range interaction. By increasing
this ratio the system undergoes a spontaneous density modulation in the form of an ordered arrangement
of multi-atom "droplets". This modulated phase can be either a "supersolid" (SS) or a "normal solid"
(NS). In the SS state droplets are immersed in a background of low-density superfluid and the system
has a finite global superfluid fraction resulting in non-classical rotational inertia. In the
NS state no such superfluid background is present and the global superfluid fraction vanishes.
We propose here a protocol to create vortices in modulated phases of dipolar BEC by "freezing" into
such phases a vortex-hosting superfluid (SF) state. The resulting system, depending upon the interactions
strengths, can be either a SS or a NS To discriminate between these two possible outcome of a "freezing"
experiment, we show that upon releasing of the radial harmonic confinement, the expanding vortex-hosting
SS shows tell-tale quantum interference effects which display the symmetry of the vortex lattice
of the originating SF, as opposed to the behavior of the NS which shows instead a ballistic radial
expansion of the individual droplets. Such markedly different behavior might be used to prove the
supersolid character of rotating dipolar condensates.
