Large high-quality single crystals of hole-doped iron-based superconductor (Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)Fe$_2$As$_2$
were grown over a broad composition range $0.22 \leq x \leq 1$ by inverted temperature gradient method.
We found that high soaking temperature, fast cooling rate, and adjusted temperature window of the
growth are necessary to obtain single crystals of heavily K doped crystals (0.65$\leq x \leq$ 0.92)
with narrow compositional distributions as revealed by sharp superconducting transitions in
magnetization measurements and close to 100% superconducting volume fraction. The crystals were
extensively characterized by x-ray and compositional analysis, revealing monotonic evolution
of the $c$-axis crystal lattice parameter with K substitution. Quantitative measurements of the
temperature-dependent in-plane resistivity, $\rho(T)$ found doping-independent, constant
within error bars, resistivity at room temperature, $\rho(300K)$, in sharp contrast with significant
doping dependence in electron and isovalent substituted BaFe$_2$As$_2$ based compositions.
The shape of the temperature dependent resistivity, $\rho(T)$, shows systematic doping-evolution,
being close to $T^2$ in overdoped and revealing significant contribution of the $T$-linear component
at optimum doping. The slope of the upper critical field, $d H_{c2}/dT$, scales linearly with $T_c$
for both $H\parallel c$, $ H_{c2,c}$, and $H \parallel ab$, $H_{c2,ab}$. The anisotropy of the upper
critical field, $\gamma \equiv H_{c2,ab} / H_{c2,c}$ determined near zero-field $T_c$ increases
from $\sim$2 to 4-5 with increasing K doping level from optimal $x \sim$0.4 to strongly overdoped
$x$=1.
