CaSO4 minerals (i.e. gypsum, anhydrite and bassanite) are widespread in natural and industrial
environments. During the last several years, a number of studies have revealed that nucleation
in the CaSO4-H2O system is non-classical, where the formation of crystalline phases involves several
steps. Based on these recent insights we have formulated a tentative general model for calcium sulfate
precipitation from solution. This model involves primary species that are formed through the assembly
of multiple Ca2+ and SO42- ions into nanoclusters. These nanoclusters assemble into poorly ordered
(i.e. amorphous) hydrated aggregates, which in turn undergo ordering into coherent crystalline
units. The thermodynamic (meta)stability of any of the three CaSO4 phases is regulated by temperature,
pressure and ionic strength with gypsum being the stable form at low temperatures and low to medium
ionic strengths, and anhydrite the stable phase at high temperatures and lower temperature at high
salinities. Bassanite is metastable across the entire phase diagram but readily forms as the primary
phase at high ionic strengths across a wide range of temperatures, and can persist up to several months.
Although the physicochemical conditions leading to bassanite formation in aqueous systems are
relatively well established, nanoscale insights into the nucleation mechanisms and pathways
are still lacking. To fill this gap, and to further improve our general model for calcium sulfate
precipitation, we have conducted in situ scattering measurements at small- and wide-angles (SAXS/WAXS)
and complemented these with in situ Raman spectroscopic characterization. Based on these experiments
we show that the process of formation of bassanite from aqueous solutions is very similar to the formation
of gypsum: it involves the aggregation of small primary species into larger disordered aggregates.
