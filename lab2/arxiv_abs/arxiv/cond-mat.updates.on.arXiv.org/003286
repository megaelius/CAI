We report an experimental study of the static magnetization $M(H,T)$ and high-field electron spin
resonance (ESR) of polycrystalline Mg$_{2}$Gd$_{3}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$, a representative member
of the newly discovered class of the so-called tripod-kagome antiferromagnets where the isotropic
Gd$^{3+}$ spins ($S = 7/2$) form a two-dimensional (2D) kagome spin-frustrated lattice. It follows
from the analysis of the low-$T$ $M(H)$-curves that the Gd$^{3+}$ spins are coupled by a small isotropic
antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange interaction $|J| \approx$ 0.3 K. The $M(H,T)$-dependences
measured down to 0.5 K evidence a rapid suppression of the AFM order taking place at $T_{\rm N} = 1.6$
K at 20 mT, by applying fields of more than 3 T. ESR spectra measured in fields up to 15 T reveal a prominent
role of the dipole-dipole interactions with energy $E_{\text{DD}} \approx$ 2.35 K for the low-temperature
magnetism of the title compound. The dipolar interactions give rise to anisotropic internal fields
developing in the material at $T<30$ K, which grow with decreasing $T$ and with increasing the strength
of the applied magnetic field. Interestingly, in this temperature regime the ESR linewidth experiences
a critical broadening due to the slowing down of the spin dynamics typically occurring by approaching
magnetic order. However, this critical behavior is observed in a strong field of $\approx 8$ T where
the phase transition is strongly suppressed. Thus, Mg$_{2}$Gd$_{3}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$ in high
magnetic fields appears to be in the correlated spin-liquid-like state without long-range order
in a broad temperature range below $\sim 30$ K which evidences the importance of geometrical spin
frustration for the low-temperature magnetism of this compound.
