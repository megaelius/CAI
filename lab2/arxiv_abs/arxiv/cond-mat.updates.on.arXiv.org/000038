Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray scattering is an emerging approach to image the dynamical evolution
of the electronic charge distribution during complex chemical and biological processes in real-space
and real-time. Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical
(QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic
wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated
for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., {\bf 109}, 11636
(2012)]. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of time-resolved x-ray scattering from a sample
containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the theories. In a
many-electron system, the role of scattering interference between a non-stationary and several
stationary electrons to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical
theory provide different results for the contribution from the scattering interference, which
depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings
are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray TRI for an electronic wavepacket in helium.
It is shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within semiclassical theory
and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent
interference, whereas the time-dependent scattering interference contribution does not vanish
in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary
electron scattering.
