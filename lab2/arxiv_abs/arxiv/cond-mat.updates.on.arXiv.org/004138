In the realm of granular bedforms, barchan dunes are strong attractors that can be found in rivers,
terrestrial deserts and other planetary environments. These bedforms are characterized by a crescentic
shape, which, although robust, presents different scales according to the environment they are
in, their length scale varying from the decimeter under water to the kilometer on Mars. In addition
to the scales of bedforms, the transport of grains presents significant differences according
to the nature of the entraining fluid, so that the growth of barchans rests to be fully understood.
Given the smaller length and time scales of the aquatic case, subaqueous barchans are the ideal object
to study the growth of barchan dunes. In the present paper, we reproduce numerically the experiments
of Alvarez and Franklin [Phys. Rev. E 96, 062906 (2017) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 164503 (2018)] on
the shape evolution of barchans from their initiation until they have reached a stable shape. We
computed the bed evolution by using computational fluid dynamics - discrete element method (CFD-DEM),
where we coupled DEM with large eddy simulation (LES) for the same initial and boundary conditions
of experiments, performed in a closed-conduit channel where initially conical heaps evolved to
single barchans under the action of a water flow in turbulent regime. Our simulations captured well
the evolution of the initial pile toward a barchan dune in both the bedform and grain scales, with
the same characteristic time and lengths observed in experiments. In addition, we obtained the
local granular flux and the resultant force acting on each grain, the latter not yet previously measured
nor computed. This shows that the present method is appropriate to numerical computations of bedforms,
opening new possibilities for accessing data that are not available from current experiments.
