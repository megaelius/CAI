The agricultural industry requires improved efficacy of sprays being applied to crops and weeds
to reduce their environmental impact and increase financial returns. One way to improve efficacy
is by enhancing foliar penetration. The plant leaf cuticle is the most significant barrier to agrochemical
diffusion within the leaf. It has been noted that a comprehensive set of mechanisms for ionic active
ingredient penetration through plant leaves with surfactants is not well defined and oils that
enhance penetration have been given little attention. The importance of a mechanistic mathematical
model has been noted previously in the literature. Two mechanistic mathematical models have been
previously developed by the authors, focusing on plant cuticle penetration of calcium chloride
through tomato fruit cuticles. The models included ion binding and evaporation with hygroscopic
water absorption, along with the ability to vary the active ingredient concentration and type,
relative humidity and plant species. Here we further develop these models to include lipophilic
adjuvant effects, as well as the adsorption and desorption of compounds on the cuticle surface with
a novel Adaptive Competitive Langmuir model. These modifications to a penetration model provide
a novel addition to the literature. We validate our theoretical model results against appropriate
experimental data, discuss key sensitivities and relate theoretical predictions to physical
mechanisms. The results indicate the addition of the desorption mechanism may be one way to predict
increased penetration at late times and the sensitivity of model parameters compares wells to those
present in the literature.
