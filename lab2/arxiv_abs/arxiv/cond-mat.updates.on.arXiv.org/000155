Popular Summary:Polar oxides, consisting of charged layers (e.g., (100) LaAlO3 (LAO) as layers
of LaO+1 and AlO2-1) have generated a great deal of excitement in the last decade. At an interface
of a polar (LAO) with a non-polar insulator SrTiO3 (STO) a discontinuity in charge polarization
is created resulting in a potential that builds up linearly with the number of polar overlayers.
To avoid this potential buildup, a charge transfer to the interface occurs and this creates a two
dimensional electron gas (2DEG-P) which has captivated the attention of researchers in this field.
However, STO can be made conducting if oxygen vacancies are created on its surface (2DEG-V). The
relative role of these two mechanisms and their contribution to the 2DEG have been hot topics. In
this work we show that with crystalline overlayers (without oxygen post-annealing) both mechanisms
contribute to the 2DEG. That is because when STO has an overlayer (either amorphous or crystalline)
containing a strong oxygen affinity element such as Al, 2DEG-V can be created through oxygen vacancies
arising from the strong chemical affinity of Al to oxygen. However, there is no 2DEG-P in the case
of amorphous overlayers. 2DEG-V can be removed by oxygen post-annealing and therefore 2DEG-P alone
accounts for the interface conductivity in oxygen-annealed crystalline LAO/STO heterostructures.
Futhermore, it was found that high crystallinity of the overlayer is crucial for the polarization
catastrophe mechanism (2DEG-P) in the case of crystalline LAO overlayers. We also show that these
two types of carriers are different in their behavior: 2DEG-P is degenerate while 2DEG-V is thermally
activated. These findings guide us how to create high mobility 2DEG at oxide interfaces with the
carriers of choice, which may be important for the future of oxide electronics.
