Mechanical testing of micropillars is a field that involves new physics, as the behaviour of materials
is non-deterministic at this scale. To better understand their deformation mechanisms we applied
3-dimensional high angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (3D HR-EBSD) to reveal
the dislocation distribution in deformed single crystal copper micropillars. Identical micropillars
were fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) and compressed at room temperature. The deformation process
was stopped at different strain levels (~1%, 4% and 10%) to study the evolution of geometrically
necessary dislocations (GNDs). Serial slicing with FIB and consecutive HR-EBSD mapping on the
(100) side was used to create and compare 3-dimensional maps of the deformed volumes. Average GND
densities were calculated for each deformation step. Total dislocation density calculation based
on X-ray synchrotron measurements were conducted on the $4\%$ pillar to compare dislocation densities
determined by the two complementary methods. Scanning transmission electronmicroscopy (STEM)
and transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) images were captured on the 10% pillar to visualize
the actual dislocation structure. With the 3D HR-EBSD technique we have studied the geometrically
necessary dislocations evolving during the deformation of micropillars. An intermediate behaviour
was found at the studied sample size between bulk and nanoscale plasticity: A well-developed dislocation
cell structure built up upon deformation but with significantly lower GND density than in bulk.
This explains the simultaneous observation of strain hardening and size effect at this scale.
