In contrast to monolayer graphene, in bilayer graphene (BLG) one can induce a tunable bandgap by
applying an external electric field, which makes it suitable for field effect applications. Extrinsic
doping of BLGs enriches the electronic properties of the graphene-based family, as their behavior
can be switched from an intrinsic small-gap semiconductor to a degenerate semiconductor. In the
framework of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the electronic and
thermoelectric properties of BLGs doped with extrinsic impurities from groups III (B, Al, Ga),
IV (Si, Ge) and V (N, P, As), in the context of applied external electric fields. Doping one monolayer
of the BLG with p- or n-type dopants results in a degenerate semiconductor, where the Fermi energy
depends on the type of the impurity, but also on the magnitude and orientation of the electric field,
which modifies the effective doping concentration. Doping one layer with isoelectronic species
like Si and Ge opens a gap, which may be closed upon applying an electric field, in contrast to the pristine
BLG. Furthermore, dual doping by III-V elements, in a way that the BLG system is formed by one n-type
and one p-type graphene monolayer, leads to intrinsic semiconductor properties with relatively
large energy gaps. Si-Si and Ge-Ge substitutions render a metallic like behavior at zero field similar
to the standard BLG, however with an asymmetric density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi energy.
We analyze the suitability of the highly doped BLG materials for thermoelectric applications,
exploiting the large asymmetries of the density of states. In addition, a sign change in the Seebeck
coefficient is observed by tuning the electric field as a signature of narrow bands near the Fermi
level.
