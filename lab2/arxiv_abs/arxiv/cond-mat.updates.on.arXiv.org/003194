The mysterious pseudo-gap (PG) phase of cuprate superconductors has been the subject of intense
investigation over the last thirty years, but without a clear agreement about its origin. Owing
to a recent observation in Raman spectroscopy, of a precursor in the charge channel, on top of the
well known fact of a precursor in the superconducting channel, we present here a novel idea: the PG
is formed through a Higgs mechanism, where two kinds of preformed pairs, in the particle-particle
and particle-hole channels, become entangled through a freezing of their global phase. We detail
the $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theory at the origin of this phenomenon for underdoped cuprates. At
$T^{*}$, the freezing of the global phase sets the unique PG energy scale $E^{*}$ which also opens
a gap in the Fermi surface. Below $T^{*}$ we observe the formation of quasi long-range charge modulations
at $T_{co}$ and a fluctuation regime of the Cooper pairs below $T_{c}^{\prime}$. A second condensation
mechanism occurs at a lower temperature $T_{c}$, where the relative phase of the doublet of preformed
pairs gets quenched. This defines the superconducting state, which here has the form of a super-solid
with a finite superposition of condensed Cooper pairs and modulated particle-hole pairs. Through
the idea of "locking" of phases between the charge and superconducting modes, the theory gives a
unique explanation for the unusual global phase coherence of short-range charge modulations,
observed below $T_{c}$ on phase sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). A simple microscopic
model enables us to estimate the mean-field values of the precursor gaps in each channel and the PG
energy scale, and to compare them to the values observed in Raman scattering spectroscopy. We also
discuss the possibility of a multiplicity of orders in the PG phase.
