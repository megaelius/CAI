he contact angle of a liquid droplet on a surface under partial wetting conditions differs for a nanoscopically
rough or periodically corrugated surface from its value for a perfectly flat surface. Wenzel's
relation attributes this difference simply to the geometric magnification of the surface area
(by a factor $r_{\rm w}$), but the validity of this idea is controversial. We elucidate this problem
by model calculations for a sinusoidal corrugation of the form $z_{\rm wall}(y) = \Delta\cos(2\pi
y/\lambda)$ , for a potential of short range $\sigma_{\rm w}$ acting from the wall on the fluid particles.
When the vapor phase is an ideal gas, the change of the wall-vapor surface tension can be computed
exactly, and corrections to Wenzel's equation are typically of order $\sigma_{\rm w}\Delta/\lambda^2$.
For fixed $r_{\rm w}$ and fixed $\sigma_{\rm w}$ the approach to Wenzel's result with increasing
$\lambda$ may be nonmonotonic and this limit often is only reached for $\lambda/\sigma_{\rm w}>30$.
For a non-additive binary mixture, density functional theory is used to work out the density profiles
of both coexisting phases both for planar and corrugated walls, as well as the corresponding surface
tensions. Again, deviations from Wenzel's results of similar magnitude as in the above ideal gas
case are predicted. Finally, a crudely simplified description based on the interface Hamiltonian
concept is used to interpret corresponding simulation results along similar lines. Wenzel's approach
is found to generally hold when $\lambda/\sigma_{\rm w}\gg 1$, $\Delta/\lambda<1$, and conditions
avoiding proximity of wetting or filling transitions.
