The mutually commuting $1\times n$ fused single and double-row transfer matrices of the critical
six-vertex model are considered at roots of unity $q=e^{i\lambda}$ with crossing parameter $\lambda=\frac{(p'-p)\pi}{p'}$
a rational fraction of $\pi$. The $1\times n$ transfer matrices of the dense loop model analogs,
namely the logarithmic minimal models ${\cal LM}(p,p')$, are similarly considered. For these
$s\ell(2)$ models, we find explicit closure relations for the $T$-system functional equations
and obtain extended sets of bilinear $T$-system identities. We also define extended $Q$ matrices
as linear combinations of the fused transfer matrices and obtain extended matrix $T$-$Q$ relations.
These results hold for diagonal twisted boundary conditions on the cylinder as well as $U_q(s\ell(2))$
invariant/Kac vacuum and off-diagonal/Robin vacuum boundary conditions on the strip. Using our
extended $T$-system and extended $T$-$Q$ relations for eigenvalues, we deduce the usual scalar
Baxter $T$-$Q$ relation and the Bazhanov-Mangazeev decomposition of the fused transfer matrices
$T^{n}(u+\lambda)$ and $D^{n}(u+\lambda)$, at fusion level $n=p'-1$, in terms of the product
$Q^+(u)Q^-(u)$ or $Q(u)^2$. It follows that the zeros of $T^{p'-1}(u+\lambda)$ and $D^{p'-1}(u+\lambda)$
are comprised of the Bethe roots and complete $p'$ strings. We also clarify the formal observations
of Pronko and Yang-Nepomechie-Zhang and establish, under favourable conditions, the existence
of an infinite fusion limit $n\to\infty$ in the auxiliary space of the fused transfer matrices.
Despite this connection, the infinite-dimensional oscillator representations are not needed
at roots of unity due to finite closure of the functional equations.
