Time periodic driving serves not only as a convenient way to engineer effective Hamiltonians, but
also as a means to produce intrinsically dynamical phases that do not exist in the static limit. A
recent example of the latter are 2D chiral Floquet (CF) phases exhibiting anomalous edge dynamics
that pump discrete packets of quantum information along one direction. In non-fractionalized
systems with only bosonic excitations, this pumping is quantified by a dynamical topological index
that is a rational number -- highlighting its difference from the integer valued invariant underlying
equilibrium chiral phases (e.g. quantum Hall systems). Here, we explore CF phases in systems with
emergent anyon excitations that have fractional statistics (Abelian topological order). Despite
the absence of mobile non-Abelian particles in these systems, external driving can supply the energy
to pump otherwise immobile non-Abelian defects (sometimes called twist defects or genons) around
the boundary, thereby transporting an irrational fractional number of quantum bits along the edge
during each drive period. This enables new CF phases with chiral indices that are square roots of
rational numbers, inspiring the label: "radical CF phases". We demonstrate an unexpected bulk-boundary
correspondence, in which the radical CF edge is tied to bulk dynamics that exchange electric and
magnetic anyon excitations during each period. We construct solvable, stroboscopically driven
versions of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model that realize these radical CF phases, and discuss their
stability against heating in strongly disordered many-body localized settings or in the limit
of rapid driving as an exponentially long-lived pre-thermal phenomena.
