The theory of orbital magnetization is reconsidered by defining additional quantities that incorporate
a non-Hermitian effect due to anomalous operators that break the domain of definition of the Hermitian
Hamiltonian. As a result, boundary contributions to the observable are rigorously and analytically
taken into account. In this framework, we extend the standard velocity operator definition in order
to incorporate an anomaly of the position operator that is inherent in band theory, which results
in an explicit boundary velocity contribution. Using the extended velocity, we define the electrons'
intrinsic orbital circulation and we argue that this is the main quantity that captures the orbital
magnetization phenomenon. As evidence of this assertion, we demonstrate the explicit relation
between the nth band electrons' collective intrinsic circulation and the approximated, evaluated
with respect to Wannier states, local and itinerant circulation contributions that are frequently
used in the modern theory of orbital magnetization. A quantum mechanical formalism for the orbital
magnetization of extended and periodic topological solids (insulators or metals) is redeveloped
without any Wannier localization approximation or heuristic extension [Caresoli, Thonhauser,
Vanderbilt and Resta, Phys. Rev. B 74, 024408 (2006)]. It is rigorously shown that, as a result of
the non-Hermitian effect, an emerging covariant derivative enters the one-band (adiabatically
deformed) approximation k-space expression for the orbital magnetization. In the corresponding
many-band (unrestricted) k-space formula, the non-Hermitian effect contributes an additional
boundary quantity which is expected to give locally (in momentum space) giant contributions whenever
band crossings occur along with Hall voltage due to imbalance of electron accumulation at the opposite
boundaries of the material.
