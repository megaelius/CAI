This work shows an unconventional route for spin-driven ferroelectricity originating from a metastable
magnetic field-induced canting of chromium sublattice in the presence of gadolinium moments in
GdCrTiO5 at low temperatures. Compared to the isostructural neodymium compound significant differences
of the magnetism and magnetoelectric effects arise. We present a thorough investigation of temperature
and magnetic field dependent magnetization as well as ac and dc magnetic susceptibility. These
bulk measurements are complemented by local-probe spectroscopy utilizing electron-spin resonance
and muon-spin rotation/relaxation for probing the chromium moments. The ferroelectric order
is analyzed via pyro- and magnetocurrent measurements. The GdCrTiO5 shows a pyrocurrent signal
around 10 K, only if the system is cooled in an applied magnetic field exceeding 10 kOe. A distinct
spin-driven ferroelectric order is revealed in this state for temperatures below 8 K, which can
be switched via magnetic and electrical fields. But, the magnetic measurements reveal no clear
signature of long-range magnetic ordering. Presence of such meta-magnetoelectric-type behavior
in absence of any meta-magnetic behaviour is rare in literature. Our microscopic spectroscopy
results indicate significant changes of the magnetic properties around 10 K. Probably there is
exchange frustration between Gd and Cr moments, which prevents long-range magnetic ordering at
further high temperature. Below 11 K, weak magnetic ordering occurs by minimizing frustration
due to lattice distortion, which helps in magnetodielectric coupling. However, the non-polar
distortion achieves appreciable values after application of magnetic fields above 10 kOe to break
the spatial inversion symmetry, which creates ferroelectricity.
