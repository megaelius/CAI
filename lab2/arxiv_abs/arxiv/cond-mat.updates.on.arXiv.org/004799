Quantum algorithm design plays a crucial role in exploiting the computational advantage of quantum
devices. Here we develop a deep-reinforcement-learning based approach for quantum adiabatic
algorithm design. Our approach is generically applicable to a class of problems with solution hard-to-find
but easy-to-verify, e.g., searching and NP-complete problems. We benchmark this approach in Grover-search
and 3-SAT problems, and find that the adiabatic-algorithm obtained by our RL approach leads to significant
improvement in the resultant success probability. In application to Grover search, our RL-design
automatically produces an adiabatic quantum algorithm that has the quadratic speedup. We find
for all our studied cases that quantitatively the RL-designed algorithm has a better performance
compared to the analytically constructed non-linear Hamiltonian path when the encoding Hamiltonian
is solvable, and that this RL-design approach remains applicable even when the non-linear Hamiltonian
path is not analytically available. In 3-SAT, we find RL-design has fascinating transferability---the
adiabatic algorithm obtained by training on a specific choice of clause number leads to better performance
consistently over the linear algorithm on different clause numbers. These findings suggest the
applicability of reinforcement learning for automated quantum adiabatic algorithm design. Further
considering the established complexity-equivalence of circuit and adiabatic quantum algorithms,
we expect the RL-designed adiabatic algorithm to inspire novel circuit algorithms as well. Our
approach is potentially applicable to different quantum hardwares from trapped-ions and optical-lattices
to superconducting-qubit devices.
