Nanoporous structures including single nanopores and nanoporous membranes have been utilized
as a platform to study fundamental liquid-vapor phase change heat transfer (PCHT) processes as
well as a promising candidate for high flux heat dissipation. Both thin film boiling and evaporation
through nanoporous structures have been demonstrated to achieve high heat flux, but they are usually
considered two mutually exclusive regimes operated under vastly different conditions, and the
factors dictating how close the PCHT process is to the kinetic limit are elusive. In this work, we
utilized a unique transition between thin film boiling and evaporation through nanoporous membranes
to clarify the factors determining the heat flux and heat transfer coefficient (HTC) with respect
to the kinetic limit conditions. We unambiguously showed the controllable transition from boiling
to evaporation, when the liquid receded into the nanopores and provided additional driving force
from capillary pumping sustained in the nanoscale pores. We showed that this transition is universal
and can be understood from a simple fluid transport model for all the four types of fluids we studied,
which cover a wide span of surface tension (water, ethanol, isopropanol (IPA), FC-72). More importantly,
PCHT conditions at the transition points between boiling and evaporation were close to those of
the kinetic limit of all these fluids. However, further increase of the heat flux beyond the transition
points led to decreasing HTC and deviation from the kinetic limit, which can be attributed to the
increasing vapor resistance in the vapor space and inside the nanopores. This increasing vapor
resistance was also confirmed by experiments on IPA with different vapor pressures.
