The paper investigates localized deformation patterns resulting from the onset of instabilities
in lattice structures. The study is motivated by previous observations on discrete hexagonal lattices,
where the onset of non-uniform, quasi-static deformation patterns was associated with the loss
of convexity of the interaction potential, and where a variety of localized deformations were found
depending on loading configuration, lattice parameters and boundary conditions. These observations
are here conducted on other lattice structures, with the goal of identifying models of reduced complexity
that are able to provide insight into the key parameters that govern the onset of instability-induced
localization. To this end, we first consider a two-dimensional square lattice consisting of point
masses connected by in-plane axial springs and vertical ground springs. Results illustrate that
depending on the choice of spring constants and their relative values, the lattice exhibits in-plane
or out-of plane instabilities leading to folding and unfolding. This model is further simplified
by considering the one-dimensional case of a spring-mass chain sitting on an elastic foundation.
A bifurcation analysis of this lattice identifies the stable and unstable branches and illustrates
its hysteretic and loading path-dependent behaviors. Finally, the lattice is further reduced
to a minimal four mass model which undergoes a folding/unfolding process qualitatively similar
to the same process in the central part of a longer chain, helping our understanding of localization
in more complex systems. In contrast to the widespread assumption that localization is induced
by defects or imperfections in a structure, this work illustrates that such phenomena can arise
in perfect lattices as a consequence of the mode-shapes at the bifurcation points.
