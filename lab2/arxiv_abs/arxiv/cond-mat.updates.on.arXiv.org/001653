While in principle, finite temperature density functional theory (ftDFT) should be a powerful
tool for the study of crystallization, in practice this has not so far been the case. Progress has
been hampered by technical problems which have plagued the study of the crystalline systems using
the most sophisticated Fundamental Measure Theory models. In this paper, the reasons for the difficulties
are examined and it is proposed that the tensor functionals currently favored are in fact numerically
unstable. By reverting to an older, more heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties
are eliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of power of ftDFT
to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system. First, we show that droplets attached
to a slightly hydrophobic wall crystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites
are clearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures. In contrast, droplets in
a fully periodic calculational cell remain stable to lower temperatures and eventually show the
same spontaneous localization of the density into 'atoms' but in an amorphous structure having
many of the structural charactersitics of a glass. A small change of the protocol leads, at the same
temperature, to the formation of crystals, this time with the FCC structure typical of bulk Lennard-Jones
solids. The FCC crystals have lower free energy than the amorphous structures which in turn are more
stable than the liquid droplets. It is demonstrated that as the temperature is raised, the free energy
differences between the structures decreases until the solid clusters become less stable than
the liquid droplets and spontaneously melt. The presence of energy barriers separating the various
structures is therefore clearly demonstrated.
