We present a mapping of correlated multi-impurity Anderson models to a cluster model coupled to
a number of effective conduction bands capturing its essential low-energy physics. The major ingredient
is the complex single-particle self energy matrix of the uncorrelated problem that encodes the
influence to the host conduction band onto the dynamics of a set of correlated orbitals. While the
real part of the self-energy matrix generates an effective hopping between the cluster orbitals,
the imaginary part determines the coupling to the effective conduction bands in the mapped model.
The rank of the imaginary part determines the number of independent screening channels of the problem,
and allows the replacement of the phenomenological exhaustion criterion by a rigorous mathematical
statement. This rank provides a distinction between multi-impurity models of first kind and of
second kind. For the latter, there are insufficient screening channels available, so that a singlet
ground state must be driven by the inter-cluster spin correlations. This classification provides
a fundamental answer to the question, why ferromagnetic correlations between local moments are
irrelevant for the spin compensated ground state in dilute impurity models, whereas they compete
with the Kondo-scale in dense impurity arrays, without evoking a spin density wave. The low-temperature
physics of three examples taken from the literature are deduced from the analytic structure of the
mapped model, demonstrating the potential power of this approach. NRG calculations are presented
for up to five site cluster. We investigate the appearance of frustration induced non-Fermi liquid
fixed points in the trimer, and demonstrate the existence of several critical points of KT type at
which ferromagnetic correlations suppress the screening of an additional effective spin-$1/2$
degree of freedom.
