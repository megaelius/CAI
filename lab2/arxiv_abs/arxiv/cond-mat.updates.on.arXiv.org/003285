The dissociation energies of four transition metal dimers are determined by means of diffusion
Monte Carlo. The Jastrow, CI, and molecular orbital parameters of the wave function are both partially
and fully optimized with respect to the variational energy. The pivotal role is thereby ascribable
to the optimization of the molecular orbital parameters of a complete active space wave function
in the presence of a Jastrow correlation function. Excellent results are obtained for ZnO, FeO,
FeH, and CrS. In addition, potential energy curves are computed for the first three compounds at
multi-reference diffusion Monte Carlo (MR-DMC) level, from which spectroscopic constants such
as the equilibrium bond distance, the harmonic frequency, and the anharmonicity are extracted.
All of those quantities agree well with the experiment. Furthermore, it is shown for CrS that a restricted
active space calculation can yield improved initial orbitals by including single and double excitations
from the original active space into a set of virtual orbitals. We showed in this study that the MR-DMC
method is able to outperform established high-level quantum chemistry methods, such as coupled
cluster and CASPT2. In addition, we showed that the fixed-node error in DMC can be systematically
reduced for multi-reference systems by orbital optimization in compact active spaces. While DMC
calculations with a large number of determinants are possible and very accurate, our results demonstrate
that compact wave functions may be sufficient in order to obtain accurate nodal surfaces, which
determine the accuracy of DMC, even in the case of transition metal compounds.
