We present a new simulation scheme which allows an efficient sampling of reconfigurable supramolecular
structures made of polymeric constructs functionalized by reactive binding sites. The algorithm
is based on the configurational bias scheme of Siepmann and Frenkel and is powered by the possibility
of changing the topology of the supramolecular network by a non-local Monte Carlo algorithm. Such
plan is accomplished by a multi-scale modelling that merges coarse-grained simulations, describing
the typical polymer conformations, with experimental results accounting for free energy terms
involved in the reactions of the active sites. We test the new algorithm for a system of DNA coated
colloids for which we compute the hybridisation free energy cost associated to the binding of tethered
single stranded DNAs terminated by short sequences of complementary nucleotides. In order to demonstrate
the versatility of our method, we also consider polymers functionalized by receptors that bind
a surface decorated by ligands. In particular we compute the density of states of adsorbed polymers
as a function of the number of ligand-receptor complexes formed. Such a quantity can be used to study
the conformational properties of adsorbed polymers useful when engineering adsorption with tailored
properties. We successfully compare the results with the predictions of a mean field theory. We
believe that the proposed method will be a useful tool to investigate supramolecular structures
resulting from direct interactions between functionalized polymers for which efficient numerical
methodologies of investigation are still lacking.
