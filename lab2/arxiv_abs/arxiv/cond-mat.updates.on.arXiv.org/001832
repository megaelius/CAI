At the interface between a nonmagnetic metal (NM) and a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) spin current
can interact with the magnetization, leading to a modulation of the spin current. The interfacial
exchange field at these FI-NM interfaces can be probed by placing the interface in contact with the
spin transport channel of a lateral spin valve (LSV) device and observing additional spin relaxation
processes. We study interfacial exchange field in lateral spin valve devices where Cu spin transport
channel is in proximity with ferromagnetic insulator EuS (EuS-LSV) and yttrium iron garnet Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$
(YIG-LSV). The spin signals were compared with reference lateral spin valve devices fabricated
on nonmagnetic Si/SiO$_2$ substrate with MgO or AlO$_x$ capping. The nonlocal spin valve signal
is about 4 and 6 times lower in the EuS-LSV and YIG-LSV, respectively. The suppression in the spin
signal has been attributed to enhanced surface spin-flip probability at the Cu-EuS (or Cu-YIG)
interface due to interfacial spin-orbit field. Besides spin signal suppression we also found widely
observed low temperature peak in the spin signal at $T \sim$30 K is shifted to higher temperature
in the case of devices in contact with EuS or YIG. Temperature dependence of spin signal for different
injector-detector distances reveal fluctuating exchange field at these interfaces cause additional
spin decoherence which limit spin relaxation time in addition to conventional sources of spin relaxation.
Our results show that temperature dependent measurement with pure spin current can be used to probe
interfacial exchange field at the ferromagnetic insulator-nonmagnetic metal interface.
