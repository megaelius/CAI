Mobile impurity atoms immersed in Bose-Einstein condensates provide a new platform for exploring
Bose polarons. Recent experimental advances in the field of ultracold atoms make it possible to
realize such systems with highly tunable microscopic parameters and to explore equilibrium and
dynamical properties of polarons using a rich toolbox of atomic physics. In this paper we present
a detailed theoretical analysis of Bose polarons in one dimensional systems of ultracold atoms.
By combining a non-perturbative renormalization group approach with numerically exact diffusion
Monte Carlo calculations we obtain not only detailed numerical results over a broad range of parameters
but also qualitative understanding of different regimes of the system. We find that an accurate
description of Bose polarons requires the inclusion of two-phonon scattering terms which go beyond
the commonly used Fr\"ohlich model. Furthermore we show that when the Bose gas is in the strongly
interacting regime, one needs to include interactions between the phonon modes. We use several
theoretical approaches to calculate the polaron energy and its effective mass. The former can be
measured using radio-frequency spectroscopy and the latter can be studied experimentally using
impurity oscillations in a harmonic trapping potential. We compare our theoretical results for
the effective mass to the experiments by Catani et al. [PRA 85, 023623 (2012)]. In the weak-to-intermediate
coupling regimes we obtain excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment, without
any free fitting parameter. We supplement our analysis by full dynamical simulations of polaron
oscillations in a shallow trapping potential. We also use our renormalization group approach to
analyze the full phase diagram and identify regions that support repulsive and attractive polarons,
as well as multi-particle bound states.
