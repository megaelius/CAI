Magnetic devices are a leading contender for implementing memory and logic technologies that are
nonvolatile, that can scale to high density and high speed, and that do not suffer wear-out. However,
widespread applications of magnetic memory and logic devices will require the development of efficient
mechanisms for reorienting their magnetization using the least possible current and power. There
has been considerable recent progress in this effort, in particular discoveries that spin-orbit
interactions in heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayers can yield strong current-driven torques on
the magnetic layer, via the spin Hall effect in the heavy metal or the Rashba-Edelstein effect in
the ferromagnet. As part of the search for materials to provide even more efficient spin-orbit-induced
torques, some proposals have suggested topological insulators (TIs), which possess a surface
state in which the effects of spin-orbit coupling are maximal in the sense that an electron's spin
orientation is locked relative to its propagation direction. Here we report experiments showing
that charge current flowing in-plane in a thin film of the TI Bi_2Se_3 at room temperature can indeed
apply a strong spin-transfer torque to an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy (Py = Ni81Fe19) thin
film, with a direction consistent with that expected from the topological surface state. We find
that the strength of the torque per unit charge current density in the Bi_2Se_3 is greater than for
any other spin-torque source material measured to date, even for non-ideal TI films wherein the
surface states coexist with bulk conduction. Our data suggest that TIs have potential to enable
very efficient electrical manipulation of magnetic materials at room temperature for memory and
logic applications.
