We have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films grown
over (100)-oriented Si substrates by rf magnetron sputtering. Single-phase BFO films were deposited
in a heated substrate under a O$_2$ free low pressure Ar atmosphere (leading to high deposition rate)
and post-annealed in situ. A polycrystalline BFO pure phase was confirmed by high resolution X-ray
diffraction, performed with synchrotron radiation. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy
reveal a surface with very low roughness and mean particle size of 33 nm. The BFO phase and composition
were also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and line scanning energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy in transmission electron microscopy mode. The surface chemistry of the thin
film, analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reveals the presence of Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$
in a 2:1 ratio, a strong indication that the film contains oxygen vacancies. An hysteretic ferromagnetic
behavior with room temperature high saturation magnetization $\sim 165 \times 10^3$ A/m was measured
along the film perpendicular and parallel directions. Such high magnetization is explained in
the scope of oxygen vacancies, the break of the antiferromagnetic cycloidal order and the increase
of spin canting by change in the surface/volume ratio. Understanding the magnetic behavior of a
multiferroic thin films is a key for the development of heterogeneous layered structures and multilayered
devices, e.g. multiferroic tunnel junctions and for multiferroic exchange bias heterostructures,
e.g. in magnetoelectric random acess memories (MERAMS).
