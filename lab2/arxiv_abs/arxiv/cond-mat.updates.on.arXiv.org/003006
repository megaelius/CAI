Motivated by the collective behaviour of biological swarms, we study the critical dynamics of field
theories with coupling between order parameter and conjugate momentum in the presence of dissipation.
By performing a dynamical renormalization group calculation at one loop, we show that the violation
of momentum conservation generates a crossover between a conservative yet IR-unstable fixed point,
characterized by a dynamic critical exponent $z=d/2$, and a dissipative IR-stable fixed point
with $z=2$. Interestingly, the two fixed points have different upper critical dimensions. The
interplay between these two fixed points gives rise to a crossover in the critical dynamics of the
system, characterized by a crossover exponent $\kappa=4/d$. Such crossover is regulated by a conservation
length scale, $\mathcal R_0$, which is larger the smaller the dissipation: beyond $\mathcal R_0$
the dissipative fixed point dominates, while at shorter distances dynamics is ruled by the conservative
fixed point and critical exponent, a behaviour which is all the more relevant in finite-size systems
with weak dissipation. We run numerical simulations in three dimensions and find a crossover between
the exponents $z=3/2$ and $z=2$ in the critical slowing down of the system, confirming the renormalization
group results. From the biophysical point of view, our calculation indicates that in finite-size
biological groups mode-coupling terms in the equation of motion can significantly change the dynamical
critical exponents even in the presence of dissipation, a step towards reconciling theory with
experiments in natural swarms. Moreover, our result provides the scale within which fully conservative
Bose-Einstein condensation is a good approximation in systems with weak symmetry-breaking terms
violating number conservation, as quantum magnets or photon gases.
