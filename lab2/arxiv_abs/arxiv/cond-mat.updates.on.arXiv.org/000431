The existence and uniqueness of a steady state for nonequilibrium systems (NESS) is a fundamental
subject and a main theme of research in statistical mechanics for decades. For Gaussian systems,
such as a chain of harmonic oscillators connected at each end to a heat bath, and for anharmonic oscillators
under specified conditions, definitive answers exist in the form of proven theorems. Answering
this question for quantum many-body systems poses a challenge for the present. In this work we address
this issue by deriving the stochastic equations for the reduced system with self-consistent backaction
from the two baths, calculating the energy flow from one bath to the chain to the other bath, and exhibiting
a power balance relation in the total (chain + baths) system which testifies to the existence of a
NESS in this system at late times. The functional method we adopt here entails the use of the influence
functional, the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions, from which one can derive the
stochastic equations and calculate the average values of physical variables in open quantum systems.
This involves both taking the expectation values of quantum operators of the system and the distributional
averages of stochastic variables stemming from the coarse-grained environment. This method though
formal in appearance is compact and complete. It can also easily accommodate perturbative techniques
and diagrammatic methods from field theory. Taken all together it provides a solid platform for
carrying out systematic investigations into the nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems
and quantum thermodynamics.
