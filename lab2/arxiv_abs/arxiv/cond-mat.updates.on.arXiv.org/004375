In neutron star matter, there exist $^{1}S_{0}$ superfluids in lower density in the crust while
$^{3}P_{2}$ superfluids are believed to exist at higher density deep inside the core. In the latter,
depending on the temperature and magnetic field, either uniaxial nematic (UN) phase, D$_{2}$-biaxial
nematic (D$_{2}$-BN) phase, or D$_{4}$-biaxial nematic (D$_{4}$-BN) phase appears. In this paper,
we discuss a mixture of the $^{1}S_{0}$ and $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluids and find their coexistence.
Adopting the loop expansion and the weak-coupling approximation for the interaction between two
neutrons, we obtain the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy in which both of the $^{1}S_{0}$ and $^{3}P_{2}$
condensates are taken into account by including the coupling terms between them. We analyze the
GL free energy and obtain the phase diagram for the temperature and magnetic field. We find that the
$^{1}S_{0}$ superfluid excludes the $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid completely in the absence of magnetic
field, they can coexist for weak magnetic fields, and the $^{1}S_{0}$ superfluid is expelled by
the $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid at strong magnetic fields, thereby proving the robustness of $^{3}P_{2}$
superfluid against the magnetic field. We further show that the D$_{4}$-BN phase covers the whole
region of the $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluidity as a result of the coupling term, in contrast to the case
of a pure $^{3}P_{2}$ superfluid studied before in which the D$_{4}$-BN phase is realized only under
strong magnetic fields. Thus, the D$_{4}$-BN phase is topologically most interesting phase, e.g.,
admitting half-quantized non-Abelian vortices relevant not only in magnetars but also in ordinary
neutron stars.
