We formulate the gauge invariant Lorentz covariant Ginzburg-Landau theory which describes nonstationary
regimes: relaxation of a superconducting system accompanied by eigen oscillations of internal
degrees of freedom (Higgs mode and Goldstone mode), and also forced oscillations under the action
of an external gauge field. The theory describes Lorentz covariant electrodynamics of superconductors
where Anderson-Higgs mechanism and Higgs effect occur, in the same time the dynamics of conduction
electrons remains nonrelativistic. In addition we consider Goldstone modes and features of Anderson-Higgs
mechanism in two-band superconductors. Due to Lorentz covariance magnetostatics and electrostatics
acquire symmetrical forms, but with essential features. It is demonstrated that due to spontaneously
broken $U(1)$ symmetry the specific ponderomotive forces appear which compensate the electrostatic
and Ampere forces acting on a charge, so that the London-like laws take place for both electrostatic
and magnetic fields. Thus the electrostatic field, like magnetic field, can penetrate a superconductor
on the macroscopic depth without causing acceleration of the supercurrent. In addition we study
dissipative processes, which are caused by movement of the normal component of electron liquid
and violate the Lorentz covariance of the initial field equations, on the examples of the damping
of oscillations of the order parameter and the skin-effect for electromagnetic field. An experimental
consequence of the extended time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory regarding the penetration
of the electromagnetic field in a superconductor is proposed.
