We analyze the role of coherent tunneling that gives rise to bands of delocalized quantum states
providing a coherent pathway for population transfer (PT) between computational states with similar
energies. Given an energy function ${\cal E}(z)$ of a binary optimization problem and a bit-string
$z_i$ with atypically low energy, our goal is to find other bit-strings with energies within a narrow
window around ${\cal E}(z_i)$. We study PT due to quantum evolution under a transverse field $B_\perp$
of an n-qubit system that encodes ${\cal E}(z)$. We focus on a simple yet nontrivial model: $M$ randomly
chosen "marked" bit-strings ($2^n \gg M$) are assigned energies in the interval ${\cal E}(z)\in[-n
-W/2, n + W/2]$ with $W << B_\perp$, while the rest of the states are assigned energy $0$. The PT starts
at a marked state $z_i$ and ends up in a superposition of $\sim \Omega$ marked states inside the PT
window. The scaling of a typical runtime for PT with $n$ and $\Omega$ is the same as in the multi-target
Grover's algorithm, except for a factor that is equal to $\exp(n \,B_{\perp}^{-2}/2)$ for $n \gg
B_{\perp}^{2} \gg 1$. Unlike the Hamiltonians used in analog quantum search algorithms, the model
we consider is non-integrable, and the transverse field delocalizes the marked states. PT protocol
is not sensitive to the value of B and may be initialized at a marked state. We develop microscopic
theory of PT. Under certain conditions, the band of the system eigenstates splits into mini-bands
of non-ergodic delocalized states, whose width obeys a heavy-tailed distribution directly related
to that of PT runtimes. We find analytical form of this distribution by solving nonlinear cavity
equations for the random matrix ensemble. We argue that our approach can be applied to study the PT
protocol in other transverse field spin glass models, with a potential quantum advantage over classical
algorithms.
