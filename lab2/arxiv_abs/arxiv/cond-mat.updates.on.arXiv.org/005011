The complexity of many biological, social and technological systems stems from the richness of
the interactions among their units. Over the past decades, a great variety of complex systems has
been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links.
Yet, in face-to-face human communication, chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions
can occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be simply described just in terms of simple dyads.
Until recently, little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex
systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure
of these systems into account can greatly enhance our modeling capacities and help us to understand
and predict their emerging dynamical behaviors. Here, we present a complete overview of the emerging
field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We first discuss the methods to represent higher-order
interactions and give a unified presentation of the different frameworks used to describe higher-order
systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review
the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed in
the literature to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing simplicial complexes,
bipartite graphs and hypergraphs. We introduce and discuss the rapidly growing research on higher-order
dynamical systems and on dynamical topology. We focus on novel emergent phenomena characterizing
landmark dynamical processes, such as diffusion, spreading, synchronization and games, when
extended beyond pairwise interactions. We elucidate the relations between higher-order topology
and dynamical properties, and conclude with a summary of empirical applications, providing an
outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.
