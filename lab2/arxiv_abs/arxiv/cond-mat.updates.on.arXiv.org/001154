Recent reports of surface forces across nanoconfined ionic liquids have revealed the existence
of an anomalously long-ranged interaction apparently of electrostatic origin. Ionic liquids
are viscous and therefore it is important to inspect rigorously whether the observed repulsive
forces are indeed equilibrium forces or, rather, arise from the viscous force during drainage of
the fluid between two confining surfaces. In this paper we present our direct measurements of surface
forces between mica sheets approaching in the ionic liquid [C2C1Im][NTf2], exploring three orders
of magnitude in approach velocity. Trajectories are systematically fitted by solving the equation
of motion, allowing us to disentangle the viscous and equilibrium contributions. First, we find
that the drainage obeys classical hydrodynamics with a negative slip boundary condition in the
range of the structural force, implying that a nm-thick portion of the liquid in the vicinity of the
solid surface is composed of ordered molecules that do not contribute to the flow. Secondly, we show
that a long-range static force must indeed be invoked, in addition to the viscous force, in order
to describe the data quantitatively. This equilibrium interaction decays exponentially and with
decay length is in agreement with the screening length reported for the same system in previous studies.
In those studies the decay was simply checked to be independent of velocity and measured at low approach
rate, rather than explicitly taking account of viscous effects: we explain why this gives indistinguishable
outcomes for the screening length by noting that the viscous force is linear to very good approximation
over a wide range of distances.
