We present here two novel algorithms for simulated tempering simulations, which break detailed
balance condition (DBC) but satisfy the skewed detailed balance to ensure invariance of the target
distribution. The irreversible methods we present here are based on Gibbs sampling and concern
breaking DBC at the update scheme of the temperature swaps. We utilise three systems as a test bed
for our methods: an MCMC simulation on a simple system described by a 1D double well potential, the
Ising model and MD simulations on Alanine pentapeptide (ALA5). The relaxation times of inverse
temperature, magnetic susceptibility and energy density for the Ising model indicate clear gains
in sampling efficiency over conventional Gibbs sampling techniques with DBC and also over the conventionally
used simulated tempering with Metropolis-Hastings (MH) scheme. Simulations on ALA5 with large
number of temperatures indicate distinct gains in mixing times for inverse temperature and consequently
the energy of the system compared to conventional MH. With no additional computational overhead,
our methods were found to be more efficient alternatives to conventionally used simulated tempering
methods with DBC. Our algorithms should be particularly advantageous in simulations of large systems
with many temperature ladders, as our algorithms showed a more favorable constant scaling in Ising
spin systems as compared with both reversible and irreversible MH algorithms. In future applications,
our irreversible methods can also be easily tailored to utilize a given dynamical variable other
than temperature to flatten rugged free energy landscapes.
