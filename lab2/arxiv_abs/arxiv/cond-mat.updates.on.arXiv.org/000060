Ensembles of isotropic random matrices are defined by the invariance of the probability measure
under the left (and right) multiplication by an arbitrary unitary matrix. We show that the multiplication
of large isotropic random matrices is spectrally commutative and self-averaging in the limit of
infinite matrix size $N \rightarrow \infty$. The notion of spectral commutativity means that the
eigenvalue density of a product ABC... of such matrices is independent of the order of matrix multiplication,
for example the matrix ABCD has the same eigenvalue density as ADCB. In turn, the notion of self-averaging
means that the product of n independent but identically distributed random matrices, which we symbolically
denote by AAA..., has the same eigenvalue density as the corresponding power A^n of a single matrix
drawn from the underlying matrix ensemble. For example, the eigenvalue density of ABCCABC is the
same as of A^2B^2C^3. We also discuss the singular behavior of the eigenvalue and singular value
densities of isotropic matrices and their products for small eigenvalues $\lambda \rightarrow
0$. We show that the singularities at the origin of the eigenvalue density and of the singular value
density are in one-to-one correspondence in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$: the eigenvalue density
of an isotropic random matrix has a power law singularity at the origin $\sim |\lambda|^{-s}$ with
a power $s \in (0,2)$ when and only when the density of its singular values has a power law singularity
$\sim \lambda^{-\sigma}$ with a power $\sigma = s/(4-s)$. These results are obtained analytically
in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$. We supplement these results with numerical simulations for
large but finite N and discuss finite size effects for the most common ensembles of isotropic random
matrices.
