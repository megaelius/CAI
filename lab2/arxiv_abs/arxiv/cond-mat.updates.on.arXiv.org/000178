We study the excitonic phase transition in a system of conduction band electrons and valence band
holes described by the three-dimensional extended Falicov-Kimball (EFKM) model with tunable
Coulomb interaction $U$ between both species. By lowering the temperature the electron-hole system
may become unstable with respect to the formation of the excitons i.e, electron-hole pairs at temperature
$T=T_{\Delta}$, exhibiting a gap $\Delta$ in the particle excitation spectrum. We prove that for
large values of $U$ the excitons form the incoherent pairs uncorrelated with each other until they
undergo the excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) at lower $T=T_{c}$ driven by the phase
stiffness between the excitonic pairs. We found that the true condensate transition temperature
$T_{c}$ appears to be much smaller than the exciton pair formation temperature $T_{\Delta}$. In
this context a BEC to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type crossover could be expected: in the
strong interaction case the system is first driven into the gaped excitonic insulator (EI) state
and subsequent condensation of incoherent exciton pairs at $T_{c}<T_{\Delta}$ driven by the
phase stiffness, while in the small $U$ the temperature $T_{c} \sim T_{\Delta}$ implying that the
excitonic condensate is governed by the pair formation as in the BCS-like regime. To this end we implement
the functional integral formulation of the EFKM, where the Coulomb interaction term is expressed
in terms of U(1) quantum phase variables conjugate to the local particle number, providing a useful
representation of strongly correlated system. The effective action formalism allows us to formulate
a problem in the phase only action in the form of the quantum rotor model and obtain analytical formula
for the critical lines.
