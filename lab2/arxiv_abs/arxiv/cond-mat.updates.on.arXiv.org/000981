The exciton relaxation dynamics of photoexcited electronic states in poly($p$-phenylenevinylene)
(PPV) are theoretically investigated within a coarse-grained model, in which both the exciton
and nuclear degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically. The Frenkel-Holstein Hamiltonian
is used to describe the strong exciton-phonon coupling present in the system, while external damping
of the internal nuclear degrees of freedom are accounted for by a Lindblad master equation. Numerically,
the dynamics are computed using the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) and quantum jump trajectory
techniques. The values of the model parameters physically relevant to polymer systems naturally
lead to a separation of time scales, with the ultra-fast dynamics corresponding to energy transfer
from the exciton to the internal phonon modes (i.e., the C-C bond oscillations), while the longer
time dynamics correspond to damping of these phonon modes by the external dissipation. Associated
with these time scales, we investigate the following processes that are indicative of the system
relaxing onto the emissive chromophores of the polymer: 1) Exciton-polaron formation occurs on
an ultra-fast time scale, with the associated exciton-phonon correlations present within half
a vibrational time period of the C-C bond oscillations. 2) Exciton decoherence is driven by the decay
in the vibrational overlaps associated with exciton-polaron formation, occurring on the same
time scale. 3) Exciton density localization is driven by the external dissipation, arising from
`wavefunction collapse' occurring as a result of the system-environment interactions. Finally,
we show how fluorescence anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate the exciton decoherence
process during the relaxation dynamics.
