Since the discovery of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in 1982 there has been considerable theoretical
discussion on the possibility of fractional quantization of conductance in the absence of Landau
levels formed by a quantizing magnetic field. Although various situations have been theoretically
envisaged, particularly lattice models in which band flattening resembles Landau levels, the
predicted fractions have never been observed. In this Letter, we show that odd and even denominator
fractions can be observed, and manipulated, in the absence of a quantizing magnetic field, when
a low-density electron system in a GaAs based one-dimensional quantum wire is allowed to relax in
the second dimension. It is suggested that such a relaxation results in formation of a zig-zag array
of electrons with ring paths which establish a cyclic current and a resultant lowering of energy.
The behavior has been observed for both symmetric and asymmetric confinement but increasing the
asymmetry of the confinement potential, to result in a flattening of confinement, enhances the
appearance of new fractional states. We find that an in-plane magnetic field induces new even denominator
fractions possibly indicative of electron pairing. The new quantum states described here have
implications both for the physics of low dimensional electron systems and also for quantum technologies.
This work will enable further development of structures which are designed to electrostatically
manipulate the electrons for the formation of particular configurations. In turn, this could result
in a designer tailoring of fractional states to amplify particular properties of importance in
future quantum computation.
