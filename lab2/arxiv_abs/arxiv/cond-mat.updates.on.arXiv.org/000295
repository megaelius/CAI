Single crystal of PrSi was grown by Czochralski method in a tetra-arc furnace. Powder x-ray diffraction
of the as grown crystal revealed that PrSi crystallizes in FeB$-$type structure with space group
$Pnma$ (no. 62). PrSi undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at 52 K with [010] direction as the easy
axis of magnetization. Heat capacity data confirm the bulk nature of the transition at 52 K and exhibit
a huge anomaly at the transition. A sharp rise in the low temperature heat capacity has been observed
(below 5 K) which is attributed to the $^{141}$Pr nuclear Schottky heat capacity arising from the
hyperfine field of the Pr moment. The estimated Pr magnetic moment 2.88 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Pr from the
hyperfine splitting is in agreement with the saturation magnetization value obtained from the
magnetization data measured at 2 K. From the crystal electric field (CEF) analysis of the magnetic
susceptibility, magnetization and the heat capacity data it is found that the degenerate $J = 4$
Hund's rule derived state of Pr$^{3+}$-ion splits into nine singlets with an overall splitting
of 284 K, the first excited singlet state separated by just 9 K from the ground state. The magnetic
ordering in PrGe appears to be due to the exchange generated admixture of low lying crystal field
levels. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has been investigated from magnetization data along all the
three principal crystallographic directions. Large magnetic entropy change, $-\Delta S_M = $22.2
J/kg K, and the relative cooling power, RCP = $460$ J/kg, characteristic of giant magneto caloric
effect are achieved near the transition temperature ($T_{\rm C}$ = 52 K) for $H =$~70 kOe along $[010]$.
Furthermore, the PrSi single crystal exhibits a giant MCE anisotropy.
