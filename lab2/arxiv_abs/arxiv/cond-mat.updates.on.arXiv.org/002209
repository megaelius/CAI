The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has attracted considerable recent attention owing
to the intriguing physics behind and the fundamental role it played in stabilizing magnetic solitons,
such as magnetic skyrmions and chiral domain walls. A number of experimental efforts have been devoted
to probe the DMI, among which the most popular method is the Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy
(BLS) to measure the frequency difference of spin waves with opposite wave vectors $\pm\mathbf{k}$
perpendicular to the in-plane magnetization $\mathbf{m}$. Such a technique, however, is not applicable
for the cases of $\mathbf{k}\parallel\mathbf{m}$, since the spin-wave reciprocity is recovered
then. For a narrow magnetic strip, it is also difficult to measure the DMI strength using BLS because
of the spatial resolution limit of lights. To fill these gaps, we propose to probe the DMI via the propagation
of spin waves in ferromagnetic films. We show that the DMI can cause the non-collinearity of the group
velocities of spin waves with $\pm\mathbf{k}\parallel\mathbf{m}$. In heterogeneous magnetic
thin films with different DMIs, negative refractions of spin waves emerge at the interface under
proper conditions. These findings enable us to quantify the DMI strength by measuring the angle
between the two spin-wave beams with $\pm\mathbf{k}\parallel\mathbf{m}$ in homogeneous film
and by measuring the incident and negative refraction angles in heterogeneous films. For a narrow
magnetic strip, we propose a nonlocal scheme to determine the DMI strength via nonlinear three-magnon
processes. We implement theoretical calculations and micromagnetic simulations to verify our
ideas. The results presented here are helpful for future measurement of the DMI and for designing
novel spin-wave spintronic devices.
