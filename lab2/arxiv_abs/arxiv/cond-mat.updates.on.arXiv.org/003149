Using density functional plus dynamical mean-field theory method (DFT+DMFT) with full self-consistency
over the charge density, we study the effect of electronic correlations on the electronic structure,
magnetic properties, orbital-dependent band renormalizations, and Fermi surface of the tetragonal
phase of bulk FeS. We perform a direct structural optimization of the $P_4/nmm$ crystal structure
of paramagnetic FeS, with respect to the lattice constant $a$ and the internal coordinate $z_\mathrm{S}$
of atom S. Our results show an anomalous sensitivity of the electronic structure and magnetic properties
of FeS to fine details of its crystals structure. Upon expansion of the lattice volume, we observe
a remarkable change of the electronic structure of FeS which is associated with a complete reconstruction
of the Fermi surface topology (Lifshitz transition). This behavior is ascribed to a correlation-induced
shift of the Van Hove singularity associated with the Fe $t_2$ orbitals at the $M$ point across the
Fermi level. The Lifshitz phase transition is accompanied by a significant growth of local magnetic
moments and emergence of strong orbital-selective correlations. It is seen as a pronounced anomaly
(`kink') in the total energies upon expansion of the lattice, associated with a remarkable enhancement
of compressibility. This behavior is accompanied by an orbital-dependent formation of local moments,
a crossover from itinerant to localized orbital-selective moment behavior of the Fe $3d$ electrons.
While exhibiting weak effective mass enhancement of the Fe $3d$ states $m^*/m \sim 1.3-1.4$, correlation
effects reveal a strong impact on a position of the Van Hove singularity at the $M$ point, implying
a complex interplay between electronic correlations and band structure effects in FeS.
