Controlling the growth kinetics from the vapor phase has been a powerful paradigm enabling a variety
of metastable epitaxial semiconductors such as Sn-containing group IV semiconductors (Si)GeSn.
In addition to its importance for emerging photonic and optoelectronic applications, this class
of materials is also a rich platform to highlight the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamic
driving forces during growth of strained, nonequilibrium alloys. Indeed, these alloys are inherently
strained and supersaturated in Sn and thus can suffer instabilities that are still to be fully elucidated.
In this vein, in this work the atomic-scale microstructure of Ge0.82Sn0.18 is investigated at the
onset of phase separation as the epitaxial growth aborts. In addition to the expected accumulation
of Sn on the surface leading to Sn-rich droplets and sub-surface regions with the anticipated equilibrium
Sn composition of 1.0at.%, the diffusion of Sn atoms also yields conspicuous Sn-decorated filaments
with nonuniform Sn content in the range of ~1 to 11at.% . The latter are attributed to the formation
and propagation of dislocations, facilitating the Sn transport toward the surface through pipe
diffusion. Furthermore, the interface between the Sn droplet and GeSn shows a distinct, defective
layer with Sn content of ~22at.%. This layer is likely formed by the expelled excess equilibrium
Ge as the Sn solidifies, and its content seems to be a consequence of strain minimization between
tetragonal Sn-rich and cubic Ge-rich equilibrium phases. The elucidation of these phenomena is
crucial to understand the stability of GeSn semiconductors and control their epitaxial growth
at a uniform composition.
