A theory of flow stress (FS), reviewing and developing our research,e.g. arxiv:1803.08247;1908.09338,
is proposed,including yield strength (YS) of PC materials for quasi-static plastic loading for
grain of average size d in range 10^{-8}-10^{-2}m. It's based on statistical model of energy spectrum
distribution in each grain of 1-mode PC sample under plastic loading,with highest level equal to
maximal dislocation energy. Found distribution of scalar dislocation density leads to FS due to
Taylor strain hardening containing usual and anomalous HP laws for coarse and NC grains, respectively,
and reaches maximum for extreme grain size d_0 of order 10^{-8}m. Maximum undergoes shift to region
of larger grains for decreasing T and increasing strains. Coincidence is established among theoretical
and experimental data on YS for BCC(\alpha-Fe), FCC(Cu,Al,Ni),HCP(\alpha-Ti,Zr) PC materials
at T=300K.The T-dependence of strength quantities is studied. It is shown using Al that YS grows
with decrease in T for all grains with d>3d_0,and then YS decreases in NC region,thus determining
a temperature-dimension effect (TDE).1-phase model of PC sample is extended by including softening
GB phase into 2-phase model,and then by dispersion (un)hardening. A quasi-particle interpretation
of crystallite energy quantization is suggested.Analytic and graphic forms of HP laws are obtained
in above samples with different values of small-,large-angle GB and constant pores.The maximum
of YS and respective extremal grain size of the samples are shifted by change of 2-nd phase.The T-dependence
of YS in range of 150-350K for Al demonstrates the validity of TDE. An enlargement of 2-nd phase neutralizes
TDE.Deformation curves for 1- and 2-mode 2-phase \alpha-Fe PC model are constructed with Backofen-Considere
fracture criterion,as compared to experimental,1-phase model data, and strongly depend on multimodality
and GB
