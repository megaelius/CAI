We use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to compare two prominent types of single
molecule transitions. First, the adsorption transition of a loop (a chain with two ends bound to
an attractive substrate) driven by an attraction parameter $\varepsilon$, and second, the loop-stretch
transition in a chain with one end attached to a repulsive substrate, driven by an external end-force
$F$ applied to the free end. Specifically, we compare the behavior of the respective order parameters
of the transitions, i.e., the mean number of surface contacts in the case of the adsorption transition,
and the mean position of the chain end in the case of the loop-stretch transition. Close to the transition
points, both the static and the dynamic behavior of chains with different length $N$ are very well
described by a scaling Ansatz with the scaling parameters $(\varepsilon - \varepsilon^*) N^\phi$
(adsorption transition) and $(F - F^*) N^\nu$ (loop-stretch transition), respectively, where
$\phi$ is the crossover exponent of the adsorption transition, and $\nu$ the Flory exponent. We
show that both the loop-stretch and the loop adsorption transitions provide an exceptional opportunity
to construct explicit analytical expressions for the crossover functions which perfectly describe
all simulation results on static properties in the finite-size scaling regime. Explicit crossover
functions are based on the Ansatz for the analytical form of the order parameter distributions at
the respective transition points. In contrast to the close similarity in equilibrium static behavior,
the dynamic relaxation at the two transitions shows qualitative differences, especially in the
strongly ordered regimes.
