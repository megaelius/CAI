Monolayer van der Waals (vdW) magnets provide an exciting opportunity for exploring two-dimensional
(2D) magnetism for scientific and technological advances, but the intrinsic ferromagnetism has
only been observed at low temperatures. Here, we report the observation of room temperature ferromagnetism
in manganese selenide (MnSe$_x$) films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Magnetic and structural
characterization provides strong evidence that in the monolayer limit, the ferromagnetism originates
from a vdW manganese diselenide (MnSe$_2$) monolayer, while for thicker films it could originate
from a combination of vdW MnSe$_2$ and/or interfacial magnetism of $\alpha$-MnSe(111). Magnetization
measurements of monolayer MnSe$_x$ films on GaSe and SnSe$_2$ epilayers show ferromagnetic ordering
with large saturation magnetization of ~ 4 Bohr magnetons per Mn, which is consistent with density
functional theory calculations predicting ferromagnetism in monolayer 1T-MnSe$_2$. Growing
MnSe$_x$ films on GaSe up to high thickness (~ 40 nm) produces $\alpha$-MnSe(111), and an enhanced
magnetic moment (~ 2x) compared to the monolayer MnSe$_x$ samples. Detailed structural characterization
by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and
reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) reveal an abrupt and clean interface between
GaSe(0001) and $\alpha$-MnSe(111). In particular, the structure measured by STEM is consistent
with the presence of a MnSe$_2$ monolayer at the interface. These results hold promise for potential
applications in energy efficient information storage and processing.
