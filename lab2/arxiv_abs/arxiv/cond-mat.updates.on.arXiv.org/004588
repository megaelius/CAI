Strong connection between the single-particle and collective excitations stands out as one of
the features of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We discuss theoretically these single-particle
and density excitations of BECs focusing on the exact properties of the Green's functions developed
by Gavoret and Nozi\`eres. We also investigate these excitations by using the many-body theory
at non-zero temperatures. First, we revisited the earlier study by Gavoret and Nozi\`eres, involving
the subsequent results by Nepomnyashchii and Nepomnyashchii, in terms of the matrix formalism.
This formalism is an extension of the Nambu representation for the single-particle Green's function
of BECs to discuss the density and current response functions with reducing the complexity of calculations.
We describe the exact low-energy properties of the correlation and vertex functions, and discuss
the correspondence of the spectra between the single-particle and density excitations in the low-energy
regime. After deriving the exact low-energy structures of the Green's functions, we develop a many-body
approximation theory of BECs with making the use of the matrix formalism for describing the single-particle
Green's function and the density response function at non-zero temperatures. We show how the peaks
of the single-particle spectral function and the density response function behave with an increasing
temperature. Many-body effect on the single-particle spectral function and the density response
function is included within a random phase approximation, where satellite structures emerge because
of beyond-mean-field effects. Brief comments are also made on recent theories casting doubt upon
the conventional wisdom of the BEC: the equivalence of the dispersion relations between the single-particle
and collective excitations in the low-energy and low-momentum regime.
