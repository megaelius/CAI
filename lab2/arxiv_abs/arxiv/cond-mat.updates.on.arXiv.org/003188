We apply the recently formulated torque equilibrium spin wave theory (TESWT) to compute the $1/S$-order
interacting $K$ -edge bimagnon resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of an anisotropic
triangular lattice antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We extend
the interacting torque equilibrium formalism, incorporating the effects of DM interaction, to
appropriately account for the zero-point quantum fluctuation that manifests as the emergence
of spin Casimir effect in a noncollinear spin spiral state. Using inelastic neutron scattering
data from Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ we fit the 1/S corrected TESWT dispersion to extract exchange and DM interaction
parameters. We use these new fit coefficients alongside other relevant model parameters to investigate,
compare, and contrast the effects of spatial anisotropy and DM interaction on the RIXS spectra at
various points across the magnetic Brillouin zone. We highlight the key features of the RIXS spectrum
at the two inequivalent rotonlike points, $M(0,2 \pi/\sqrt{3})$ and $M^{'}(\pi,\pi/\sqrt{3})$,
a behavior which is quite different from an isotropic triangular lattice system. While the roton
RIXS spectra at the $M$ point undergoes a spectral downshift with increasing anisotropy, the peak
at the $M^\prime$ location loses its spectral strength without any shift. With the inclusion of
DM interaction the spiral phase is more stable and the peak at both $M$ and $M^\prime$ point exhibits
a spectral upshift. Our calculation offers a practical example of how to calculate interacting
RIXS spectra in a non-collinear quantum magnet using TESWT. Our findings provide an opportunity
to experimentally test the predictions of interacting TESWT formalism using RIXS, a spectroscopic
method currently in vogue.
