Gate-tunable quantum-mechanical tunnelling of particles between a quantum confined state and
a nearby Fermi reservoir of delocalized states has underpinned many advances in spintronics and
solid-state quantum optics. The prototypical example is a semiconductor quantum dot separated
from a gated contact by a tunnel barrier. This enables Coulomb blockade, the phenomenon whereby
electrons or holes can be loaded one-by-one into a quantum dot. Depending on the tunnel-coupling
strength, this capability facilitates single spin quantum bits or coherent many-body interactions
between the confined spin and the Fermi reservoir. Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, in which
a wide range of unique atomic layers can easily be combined, offer novel prospects to engineer coherent
quantum confined spins, tunnel barriers down to the atomic limit or a Fermi reservoir beyond the
conventional flat density of states. However, gate-control of vdW nanostructures at the single
particle level is needed to unlock their potential. Here we report Coulomb blockade in a vdW heterostructure
consisting of a transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dot coupled to a graphene contact through
an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier. Thanks to a tunable Fermi reservoir,
we can deterministically load either a single electron or a single hole into the quantum dot. We observe
hybrid excitons, composed of localized quantum dot states and delocalized continuum states, arising
from ultra-strong spin-conserving tunnel coupling through the atomically thin tunnel barrier.
Probing the charged excitons in applied magnetic fields, we observe large gyromagnetic ratios
(~8). Our results establish a foundation for engineering next-generation devices to investigate
either novel regimes of Kondo physics or isolated quantum bits in a vdW heterostructure platform.
