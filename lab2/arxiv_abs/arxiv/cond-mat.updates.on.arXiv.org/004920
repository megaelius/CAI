In active matter systems, self-propelled particles can self-organize to undergo collective motion,
leading to persistent dynamical behavior out of equilibrium. In cells, cytoskeletal filaments
and motor proteins self-organize into complex structures important for cell mechanics, motility,
and division. Collective dynamics of cytoskeletal systems can be reconstituted using filament
gliding experiments, in which cytoskeletal filaments are propelled by surface-bound motor proteins.
These experiments have observed diverse dynamical states, including flocks, polar streams, and
single-filament spirals. Recent experiments with microtubules and kinesin motor proteins found
that the collective behavior of filaments can be tuned by altering the concentration of the crowding
macromolecule methylcellulose in solution. Increasing the methycellulose concentration reduced
filament crossing, promoted alignment, and led to a transition from active, isotropically oriented
filaments to locally aligned polar streams. This emergence of collective motion is typically explained
as an increase in alignment interactions by Vicsek-type models of active polar particles. However,
it is not yet understood how steric interactions and bending stiffness modify the collective behavior
of active filaments. We use simulations of driven filaments with tunable soft repulsion and rigidity
in order to better understand how the interplay between filament flexibility and steric effects
can lead to different active dynamic states. We find that increasing filament stiffness decreases
the probability of filament alignment, yet increases collective motion and long-range order,
in contrast to the assumptions of a Vicsek-type model. In addition to repulsion and driving, tuning
filament stiffness can promote collective behavior, and controls the transition between active
isotropic filaments, locally aligned flocks, and polar streams.
