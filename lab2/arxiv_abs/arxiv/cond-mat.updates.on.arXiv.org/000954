"Fluid polyamorphism" is the existence of different condensed amorphous states in a single-component
fluid. It is either found or predicted, usually at extreme conditions, for a broad group of very different
substances, including helium, carbon, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur,tellurium, cerium, hydrogen
and tin tetraiodide. This phenomenon is also hypothesized for metastable and deeply supercooled
water, presumably located a few degrees below the experimental limit of homogeneous ice formation.
We present a generic phenomenological approach to describe polyamorphism in a single-component
fluid, which is completely independent of the molecular origin of the phenomenon. We show that fluid
polyamorphism may occur either in the presence or the absence of fluid phase separation depending
on the symmetry of the order parameter. In the latter case, it is associated with a second-order transition,
such as in liquid helium or liquid sulfur. To specify the phenomenology, we consider a fluid with
thermodynamic equilibrium between two distinct interconvertible states or molecular structures.
A fundamental signature of this concept is the identification of the equilibrium fraction of molecules
involved in each of these alternative states. However, the existence of the alternative structures
may result in polyamorphic fluid phase separation only if mixing of these structures is not ideal.
The two-state thermodynamics unifies all the debated scenarios of fluid polyamorphism in different
areas of condensed-matter physics, with or without phase separation, and even goes beyond the phenomenon
of polyamorphism by generically describing the anomalous properties of fluids exhibiting interconversion
of alternative molecular states.
