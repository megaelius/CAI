A promising route to realize entangled magnetic states combines geometrical frustration with
quantum-tunneling effects. Spin-ice materials are canonical examples of frustration, and Ising
spins in a transverse magnetic field are the simplest many-body model of quantum tunneling. Here,
we show that the tripod kagome lattice material Ho${_3}$Mg${_2}$Sb${_3}$O${_{14}}$ unites an
ice-like magnetic degeneracy with quantum-tunneling terms generated by an intrinsic splitting
of the Ho$^{3+}$ ground-state doublet, which is further coupled to a nuclear spin bath. Using neutron
scattering and thermodynamic experiments, we observe a symmetry-breaking transition at 0.32
K to a remarkable quantum state with three peculiarities: a dramatic recovery of magnetic entropy
associated with the strongly coupled electronic and nuclear spins; a fragmentation of the spin
into periodic and ice-like components strongly affected by quantum fluctuations; and persistent
inelastic magnetic excitations down to 0.12 K. These observations deviate from expectations of
classical spin fragmentation physics on a kagome lattice, but can be understood within a framework
of dipolar kagome ice under a homogeneous transverse magnetic field. By combining our experimental
data with exact diagonalization and mean-field modeling, we establish the existence of a highly
entangled fragmented state in a region where the transverse field remains a perturbation to the
dipolar interactions, which we coin as a quantum spin fragmented. However, hyperfine interactions
play a crucial role in suppressing quantum correlations and dramatically alter the single-ion
and collective properties of Ho${_3}$Mg${_2}$Sb${_3}$O${_{14}}$. Our results highlight the
crucial role played by hyperfine interactions in frustrated quantum magnets, and motivate further
theoretical investigations of spin fragmentation and coherent quantum tunneling.
