A theory of combined interference and interaction effects on the diffusive transport properties
of 3D topological insulator surface states is developed. We focus on a slab geometry (characteristic
for most experiments) and show that interactions between the top and bottom surfaces are important
at not too high temperatures. We treat the general case of different surfaces (different carrier
densities, uncorrelated disorder, arbitrary dielectric environment, etc.). In order to access
the low-energy behavior of the system we renormalize the interacting diffusive sigma model in the
one loop approximation. It is shown that intersurface interaction is relevant in the renormalization
group (RG) sense and the case of decoupled surfaces is therefore unstable. An analysis of the emerging
RG flow yields a rather rich behavior. We discuss realistic experimental scenarios and predict
a characteristic non-monotonic temperature dependence of the conductivity. In the infrared (low-temperature)
limit, the systems flows into a metallic fixed point. At this point, even initially different surfaces
have the same transport properties. Investigating topological effects, we present a local expression
of the $\mathbb Z_2$ theta term in the sigma model by first deriving the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory
for class DIII by means of non-abelian bosonization and then breaking the symmetry down to AII. This
allows us to study a response of the system to an external electromagnetic field. Further, we discuss
the difference between the system of Dirac fermions on the top and bottom surfaces of a topological
insulator slab and its non-topological counterpart in a double-well structure with strong spin-orbit
interaction.
