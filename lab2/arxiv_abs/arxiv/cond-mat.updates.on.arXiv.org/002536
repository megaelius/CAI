The heterovalent ternary semiconductors that are based on the wurtzite lattice are discussed within
the framework of Landau theory. It is shown that this system of II-IV-V2 semiconductors falls into
the set of materials that exhibits lattice disorder via antiphase domain formations, characterized
by a klassengleiche (k-type) group-subgroup relation between competing phases. The site exchange
defect, which consists of two adjacent antisite defects, is identified as the nucleation mechanism
of the antiphase domain formations. Inspection of the atomic arrangements that result from site
exchange defect formations reveals that the subgroup phase with space group Pna21 forms antiphase
domains within the group phase with space group Pmc21. The phase with space group Pmn21 is an intermediate
phase. It follows that the system undergoes first order, reconstructive phase transitions between
the lower symmetry, low temperature Pna21 phase and the higher symmetry, high temperature Pmc21
phase, with a transient mixed phase regime that occurs around the Curie temperature. The order parameter
(n) of the phase transition is assigned to the c-plane net polarization vector, and it is shown that
the symmetry of the order parameter corresponds to the irreducible representation of the high symmetry
point S in the Pmc21 Brillouin zone at k=(0.5,0.5,0). The Landau potential that describes the system
is constructed using the International Tables for Crystallography, the Bilbao Crystallographic
Server and the resources at stokes.byu.edu. ZnGeN2 and ZnSnN2 are discussed in light of this model.
This work illustrates the value of using mathematical crystallography in concert with computational
physics.
