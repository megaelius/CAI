A canonical quantization procedure is applied to elastic waves interacting with pinned dislocation
segments via the Peach-Koehler force. The interaction Hamiltonian, derived from an action principle
that classically generates the Peach-Koehler force, is a power series of creation and annihilation
operators. The leading term is quadratic, and keeping only this term the observable quantities
of scattering processes are computed to all orders in perturbation theory. The resulting theory
is characterized by the magnitude of $kL$, with $k$ the wavenumber of an incident phonon. The theory
is solved for arbitrary $kL$, and different limits are explored. A significant result at this level
is the scattering cross section for phonons by dislocation segments. This cross section has a much
richer structure than the linear-in-frequency behavior that is inferred from scattering by an
infinite, static, dislocation. When many dislocations are present, an effective mass operator
is computed in the Weak and Independent Scattering Approximation. The contribution of the cubic
terms is computed to leading order in perturbation theory, allowing for a comparison of the scattering
of a phonon by excited dislocations and three-phonon scattering, as well as studying the dependence
of scattering amplitudes on the temperature of the solid. It is concluded that the effect of dislocations
will dominate for relatively modest dislocation densities. Finally, the full power series of the
interaction Hamiltonian is considered. The effects of quantum corrections, i.e., contributions
proportional to Planck's constant, are estimated, and found to be controlled by another wavenumber-dependent
parameter $k d_q$, where $d_q$ is a length proportional to $\sqrt{\hbar}$. The possibility of using
the results of this paper in the study of the phononic thermal properties of two- and three-dimensional
materials is noted and discussed.
