Bacteria living on surfaces use different types of motility mechanisms to move on the surface in
search of food or to form micro-colonies. Twitching is one such form of motility employed by bacteria
such as N. gonorrhoeae, in which the polymeric extensions known as type IV pili mediate its movement.
Pili extending from cell body adheres to the surface and pulls the bacteria by retraction. The bacterial
movement is decided by the two-dimensional tug-of-war between the pili attached to the surface.
Natural surfaces in which these micro-crawlers dwell are generally spatially inhomogeneous and
have varying surface properties. Their motility is known to be affected by the topography of the
surfaces. Therefore, it is possible to control bacterial movement by designing structured surfaces
which can be potentially utilized for controlling biofilm architecture. In this paper, we numerically
investigate the twitching motility in a two-dimensional corrugated channel. The bacterial movement
is simulated by two different models: (a) a detailed tug-of-war model which extensively describe
the twitching motility of bacteria assisted by pili and (b) a coarse-grained run-and-tumble model
which depicts the motion of wide-ranging self-propelled particles. The simulation of bacterial
motion through asymmetric corrugated channels using the above models show rectification. The
bacterial transport depends on the geometric parameters of the channel and inherent system parameters
such as persistence length and self-propelled velocity. In particular, the variation of the particle
current with the geometric parameters of the micro-channels show that one can optimize the particle
current for specific values of these parameters.
