Based on the van der Waals density functional theory (vdW-DFT)+U scheme, we carry out the ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) study of the interaction dynamics for H$_{2}$ impingement against the
stoichiometric PuO$_{2}$(111), the reduced PuO$_{2}$(111), and the stoichiometric $\alpha
$-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$(111) surfaces. The hydrogen molecular physisorption states, which can not
be captured by pure DFT+\textit{U} method, are obtained by employing the vdW-DFT+\textit{U} scheme.
We show that except for the weak physisorption, PuO$_{2}$(111) surfaces are so difficult of access
that almost all of the H$_{2}$ molecules will bounce back to the vacuum when their initial kinetic
energies are not sufficient. Although the dissociative adsorption of H$_{2}$ on PuO$_{2}$(111)
surfaces is found to be very exothermic, the collision-induced dissociation barriers of H$_{2}$
are calculated to be as high as $3.2$ eV and $2.0$ eV for stoichiometric and reduced PuO$_{2}$ surfaces,
respectively. Unlike PuO$_{2}$, our AIMD study directly reveals that the hydrogen molecules can
penetrate into $\alpha $-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$(111) surface and diffuse easily due to the $25$\ native
O vacancies located along the $\langle $111$\rangle $ diagonals of $\alpha $-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$
matrix. By examining the temperature effect and the internal vibrational excitations of H$_{2}$,
we provide a detailed insight into the interaction dynamics of H$_{2}$ in $\alpha $-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$.
The optimum pathways for hydrogen penetration and diffusion, the corresponding energy barriers
($1.0$ eV and $0.53$ eV, respectively) and rate constants are systematically calculated. Overall,
our study fairly reveals the different interaction mechanisms between H$_{2}$ and Pu-oxide surfaces,
which have strong implications to the interpretation of experimental observations.
