A thermodynamically consistent phase-field model is developed to study the non-isothermal grain
coalescence during the sintering process, with a potential application to the simulation in unconventional
sintering techniques, e.g. spark plasma sintering, field-assisted sintering, and selective
laser sintering, where non-equilibrium and high temperature gradient exist. In the model, order
parameters are adopted to represent the bulk and atmosphere/pore region, as well as the crystallographic
orientations. Based on the entropy analysis, the temperature-dependent free energy density is
developed, which includes contributions from the internal energy (induced by the change of temperature
and order parameters) and the order parameter related configurational entropy. The temperature-dependent
model parameters are determined by using the experimental data of surface and grain boundary energies
and interface width. From laws of thermodynamics, the kinetics for the order parameters and the
order-parameter-coupled heat transfer are derived. The model is numerically implemented by the
finite element method. Grain coalescence from two identical particles shows that non-isothermal
condition leads to the unsymmetric morphology and curved grain boundary due to the gradients of
on-site surface and grain-boundary energies induced by the local temperature inhomogeneity.
More simulations on the non-isothermal grain coalescence from two non-identical and multiple
particles present the temporal evolution of grain shrinkage/growth, neck growth, and porosity,
demonstrating the capability and versatility of the model. It is anticipated that the work could
provide a contribution to the research community of unconventional sintering techniques that
can be used to model the non-isothermal related microstructural features.
