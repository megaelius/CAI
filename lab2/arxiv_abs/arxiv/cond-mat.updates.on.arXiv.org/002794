We study the critical behavior of dc magnetization in the uranium ferromagnet URhSi around the paramagnetic
to ferromagnetic phase transition at T_C~ 10 K with a modified Arrott plot, a Kouvel-Fisher plot,
the critical isotherm analysis and the scaling analysis. URhSi is isostructural to uranium ferromagnetic
superconductors URhGe and UCoGe. The critical exponent beta for the temperature dependence of
the spontaneous magnetization below TC, gamma for the magnetic susceptibility, and delta for the
magnetic isotherm at T_C in URhSi have been determined as beta = 0.300 +- 0.002, gamma = 1.00 +- 0.02,
and delta = 4.38 +- 0.04 by the scaling analysis and the critical isotherm analysis. These critical
exponents fulfill the Widom scaling law delta = 1+ gamma/beta. Magnetization has strong uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic state of URhSi. However, the universality class of the
ferromagnetic transition does not belong to the 3D Ising system with short-range exchange interactions
between magnetic moments (beta = 0.325, gamma = 1.241, and delta = 4.82). The obtained exponents
in URhSi are similar to those in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors UGe_2 and URhGe, and
uranium ferromagnets UIr and U(Co_0.98Os_0.02)Al. We have previously reported the unconventional
critical behavior of magnetization in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors [N. Tateiwa
et al. Phys. Rev. B 89, 064420 (2014)]. The universality class of the ferromagnetic transition in
URhSi may belong to the same one in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors and the uranium ferromagnets.
The unconventional critical behavior of the magnetization in the uranium compounds cannot be understood
with previous theoretical interpretations of critical phenomena. The absence of the superconductivity
in URhSi is discussed from several viewpoints.
