Quasi-free standing graphene (QFG) obtained from the intercalation of a hydrogen layer between
a SiC surface and the graphene is recognized as an excellent candidate for the development of graphene
based technology. In addition, the recent proposal of a direct equivalence between the $p$-type
doping typically found for these systems and the spontaneous polarization (SP) associated to the
particular SiC polytype, opens the possibility of tuning the number of carriers in the Dirac cones
without the need of external gate voltages. However, first principles calculations which could
confirm at the atomic scale the effect of the SP are lacking mainly due to the difficulty of combining
a bulk property such as the SP with the surface confined graphene doping. Here we develop an approach
based on standard density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations in order to quantify the effect
of the SP on the QFG doping level. First, we present a novel and accurate scheme to estimate the SPs
by exploiting the dependence of the slab's dipole moment with its thickness. Next, and in order to
circumvent the DFT shortcomings associated to polar slab geometries, a double gold layer is attached
at the C-terminated bottom of the slab which introduces a metal induced gap state that pins the chemical
potential inside the gap thus allowing a meaningful comparison of the QFG dopings among different
polytypes. Furthermore, the slab dipole can be removed after adjusting the Au-Au interlayer distances.
Our results confirm that the SP does indeed induce a substantial p-doping of the Dirac cones which
can be as large as a few hundreds of meV depending on the hexagonality of the polytype. The evolution
of the doping with the slab thickness or, equivalently, with the number of stacking defects, reveals
that at least ten SiC bilayers are required to fully develop the SP and recover the macroscopic regime.
