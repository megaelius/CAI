We present a detailed theoretical study of bilayer-graphene's electronic properties in the presence
of electric and magnetic fields. Using group-theoretical methods, we derive an invariant expansion
of the Hamiltonian for electron states near the K point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast to known
materials, including single-layer graphene, any possible coupling of physical quantities to
components of the external electric (magnetic) field has a counterpart where the analogous component
of the magnetic (electric) field couples to exactly the same combination of quantities. For example,
a purely electric spin splitting appears as the magneto-electric analogue of the familiar magnetic
Zeeman spin splitting. The measurable thermodynamic response induced by magnetic and electric
fields is thus completely symmetric. The Pauli magnetization induced by a magnetic field takes
exactly the same functional form as the polarization induced by an electric field. Our findings
thus reveal unconventional behavior of spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom induced by external
fields. Although they seem counterintuitive, our findings are consistent with fundamental principles
such as time reversal symmetry. For example, only a magnetic field can give rise to a macroscopic
spin polarization, whereas only a perpendicular electric field can induce a macroscopic polarization
of the sublattice-related pseudospin degree of freedom characterizing the intravalley orbital
motion in bilayer graphene. These rules enforced by symmetry for the matter-field interactions
clarify the nature of spins versus pseudospins. We have obtained numerical values of prefactors
for relevant coupling terms. While our theoretical arguments use bilayer graphene as an example,
they are generally valid for any material with similar symmetries.
