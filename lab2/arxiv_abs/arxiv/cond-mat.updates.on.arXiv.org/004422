Surface diffusion is thought to be the primary transport mechanism for coarsening of bulk nanoporous
metals, materials which consist of bicontinuous networks of pores and metallic ligaments. To better
understand coarsening dynamics in these materials, we simulate coarsening via surface diffusion
of bicontinuous three-dimensional structures using a phase field model. The simulated structures
are characterized in terms of topology (genus density), the interfacial shape distribution, and
autocorrelations of phase and mean curvature. At nominal volume fractions of 50%-50% and 36%-64%,
we observe self-similar evolution of morphology and topology and agreement with the expected power
law for dynamic scaling, in which the characteristic length increases over time proportionally
to $t^{1/4}$. To understand the effect of transport mechanism on coarsening dynamics, we compare
the surface-diffusion structures to structures undergoing self-similar coarsening via bulk
diffusion, which follows a $t^{1/3}$ power law for dynamic scaling. While we observe the expected
difference in the coarsening kinetics, differences in scaled morphology and topology due to coarsening
mechanism are found to be surprisingly small. We find that bicontinuous structures coarsened via
surface diffusion have slightly lower scaled genus density and slightly more spatially correlated
mean curvature at short ranges when compared to structures coarsened via bulk diffusion. These
small differences are larger at 36% volume fraction than at 50% volume fraction, indicating that
the manner in which the coarsening mechanism affects the morphology depends on the volume fraction.
