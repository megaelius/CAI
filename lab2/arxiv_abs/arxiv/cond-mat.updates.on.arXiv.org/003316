The phenomenon whereby atoms deal with the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining the electron
forms the basis of familiar processes. The elements in which the atoms comprise unfilled states
of electrons can be considered as eligible for electron dynamics under suitable energy and forced
behaviors, indicating that they can never be ionized. At required level, solid atoms of transition
states elongate, deform or erode as per exerting surface force to their electrons. Atoms of gases
condense, squeeze or erupt before reaching the possible liquid state. In the case of inert gas atoms,
an alternative process takes place. Atoms of inert gases, when flowing in suitable amount, split
into electron streams under excessive population of photons having characteristic of current.
As a result, when photons, while leaving inter-state electron gaps of those splitting atoms enter
air-medium their characteristics become obvious and they expose the phenomenon of the light glow.
By splitting inert gas atoms, electrons carrying forced energy of photons impinge on the underlying
elongated atoms of solid to elongate them further. When electrons carrying forced energy do not
impinge on them at a suitable inclination, so instead of elongating further, the atoms deform under
the non-orientationally based stretching of energy knots clamped to electrons. The splitting
of inert gas atoms into electrons and their carrying forced energy of releasing photons indicate
that silicon solar cells and other similar kind of gadgets generate photons having characteristic
of current. A microscopic analysis of the morphology and structure is under the resolving power
of working photons transmitted by its built-in mechanism. Electron diffraction is a photon reflection.
These fundamental revolutions bring vast changes in the existing state of science.
