We study how solidification of model freely rotating polymers under athermal quasistatic compression
varies with their bond angle $\theta_0$. All systems undergo two discrete, first-order-like transitions:
entanglement at $\phi = \phi_E(\theta_0)$ followed by jamming at $\phi = \phi_J(\theta_0) \simeq
(4/3 \pm 1/10)\phi_E(\theta_0)$. For $\phi < \phi_E(\theta_0)$, systems are in a "gas" phase wherein
all chains remain free to translate and reorient. For $\phi_E(\theta_0) \leq \phi \leq \phi_J(\theta_0)$,
systems are in a liquid-like phase wherein chains are entangled. In this phase, chains' rigid-body-like
motion is blocked, yet they can still locally relax via dihedral rotations, and hence energy and
pressure remain extremely small. The ability of dihedral relaxation mechanisms to accommodate
further compression becomes exhausted, and systems rigidify, at $\phi_J(\theta_0)$. At and slightly
above $\phi_J$, the bulk moduli increase linearly with the pressure $P$ rather than jumping discontinuously,
indicating these systems solidify via rigidity percolation. The character of the energy and pressure
increases above $\phi_J(\theta_0)$ can be characterized via chains' effective aspect ratio $\alpha_{\rm
eff}$. Large-$\alpha_{\rm eff}$ (small-$\theta_0$) systems' jamming is bending-dominated
and is similar to that observed in systems composed of straight fibers. Small-$\alpha_{\rm eff}$
(large-$\theta_0$) systems' jamming is dominated by the degree to which individual chains' dihedrals
can collapse into compact, tetrahedron-like structures. For intermediate $\theta_0$, chains
remain in highly disordered globule-like configurations throughout the compression process;
jamming occurs when entangled globules can no longer even locally relax away from one another.
