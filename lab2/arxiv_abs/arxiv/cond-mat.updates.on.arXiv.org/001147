The phenomenon whereby atoms take a positive or negative charge by losing or gaining one or more electrons
forms the basis of familiar processes. However, those atoms which occupy unfilled state executing
electron-dynamics under force application do not ionize. Atoms of many elements dealing certain
transition state at ground surface elongate under the force of opposite poles influencing at their
centre. On impinging electrons of instantaneous velocity at fixed angle to such atoms transfer
transported energy resulting into their further elongation. When electrons do not impinge at fixed
angle to naturally elongated atoms, they deal deformation behavior where stretching of energy
knots clamping electron states remains non-orientational. In the case of inert gas atoms, an alternative
process takes place. Atoms of inert gas under certain flow rate split into electron streams while
surplus propagation of photons characteristic current to their inter-state electron gap, thus,
on increasing wavelength of travelling photons to visible range reveal light glow. In solar cells
and in other similar kinds of gadgets, photonic current is generated. All sorts of microscopes reveal
details of surface topography on resolving the image, micrometers size to subatomic level, is owing
to certain pace of reflected photons. The selected area photon reflection patterns specify that
spotted dots are due to intensities of reflected photons as well which were being controlled at certain
pace of angle while interacting to surface of structure. Many phenomena are discussed here inferring
photonic current instead of electronic current. These fundamental revolutions bring vast changes
in the existing state of science.
