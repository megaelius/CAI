Evaporation of surfactant laden sessile droplets is omnipresent in nature and industrial applications
such as inkjet printing. Soluble surfactants start to form micelles in an aqueous solution for surfactant
concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Here, the evaporation of
aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sessile droplets on hydrophobic surfaces were experimentally
investigated for SDS concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 1 CMC. In contrast to the constant contact
angle of an evaporating sessile water droplet, we observed that, at the same surface the contact
angle of an SDS laden droplet with a concentration below 0.5 CMC first decreases, then increases,
and finally decreases resulting in a local contact angle minimum. Surprisingly, the minimum contact
angle was found to be substantially lower than the static receding contact angle and it decreased
with decreasing initial SDS concentration. Furthermore, the bulk SDS concentration at the local
contact angle minimum was found to decrease with a decrease in the initial SDS concentration. The
location of the observed contact angle minimum relative to the normalized evaporation time and
its minimum value proved to be independent of both the relative humidity and the droplet volume and
thus, of the total evaporation time. We discuss the observed contact angle dynamics in terms of the
formation of a disordered layer of SDS molecules on the substrate at concentrations below 0.5 CMC.
The present work underlines the complexity of the evaporation of sessile liquid-surfactant droplets
and the influence of surfactant-substrate interactions on the evaporation process.
