In a dry granular flow, size segregation behave differently for a mixture containing a few large
beads with a size ratio (S) above 5 (Thomas, Phys.Rev.E 62,96(2000)). For moderate large S, large
beads migrate to an intermediate depth in the bed: this is called intermediate segregation. For
the largest S, large beads migrate to the bottom: this is called reverse segregation (in contrast
with surface segregation). As the reversal and intermediate depth values depend on the bead fraction,
this numerical study mainly uses a single large tracer. Small fractions are also computed showing
the link between a tracer behavior and segregation process. For half-filled rotating drum and for
rough incline, two and three (3D) dimensional cases are studied. In the tumbler, trajectories of
a large tracer show that it reaches a constant depth during the flow. For large S, this depth is intermediate
with a progressive sinking when S increases. Largest S correspond to tracers at the bottom of the
flow. All 3D simulation are in quantitative agreement with the experiments. In the flow down an incline,
a large tracer reaches an equilibrium depth during flow. For large S, its depth is intermediate,
inside the bed. For the largest S, its depth is reverse, near the bottom. Results are slightly different
for thin or thick flow. For 3D thick flows, the reversal between surface and bottom positions occurs
within a short range of S: no tracer stabilizes near mid-height and two reachable intermediate depth
layers exist, below the surface and above the bottom. For 3D thin flows, all intermediate depths
are reachable, depending on S. The numerical study of larger tracer fractions (5-10%) shows the
3 segregation patterns (surface, intermediate, reverse) corresponding to the 3 types of equilibrium
depth. The reversal is smoother than for a single tracer. It happens around S=4.5, in agreement with
experiments.
