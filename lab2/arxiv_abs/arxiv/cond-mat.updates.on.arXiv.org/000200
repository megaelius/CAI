We use the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method to calculate the ground state phase diagram
of solid molecular hydrogen and examine the stability of the most important insulating phases relative
to metallic crystalline molecular hydrogen. We develop a new method to account for finite-size
errors by combining the use of twist-averaged boundary conditions with corrections obtained using
the Kwee-Zhang-Krakauer (KZK) functional in density functional theory. To study band-gap closure
and find the metallization pressure, we perform accurate quasi-particle many-body calculations
using the $GW$ method. In the static approximation, our DMC simulations indicate a transition from
the insulating Cmca-12 structure to the metallic Cmca structure at around 375 GPa. The $GW$ band
gap of Cmca-12 closes at roughly the same pressure. In the dynamic DMC phase diagram, which includes
the effects of zero-point energy, the Cmca-12 structure remains stable up to 430 GPa, well above
the pressure at which the $GW$ band gap closes. Our results predict that the semimetallic state observed
experimentally at around 360 GPa [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 108}, 146402 (2012)] may correspond to the
Cmca-12 structure near the pressure at which the band gap closes. The dynamic DMC phase diagram indicates
that the hexagonal close packed $P6_3/m$ structure, which has the largest band gap of the insulating
structures considered, is stable up to 220 GPa. This is consistent with recent X-ray data taken at
pressures up to 183 GPa [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 82}, 060101(R) (2010)], which also reported a hexagonal
close packed arrangement of hydrogen molecules.
