We explore the ground-state properties of the two-band Hubbard model with degenerate electronic
bands, parametrized by nearest-neighbor hopping $t$, intra- and inter-orbital on-site Coulomb
repulsions $U$ and $U^\prime$, and Hund coupling $J$, focusing on the case with $J>0$. Using Jastrow-Slater
wave functions, we consider both states with and without magnetic/orbital order. Electron pairing
can also be included in the wave function, in order to detect the occurrence of superconductivity
for generic electron densities $n$. When no magnetic/orbital order is considered, the Mott transition
is continuous for $n=1$ (quarter filling); instead, at $n=2$ (half filling), it is first order for
small values of $J/U$, while it turns to be continuous when the ratio $J/U$ is increased. A significant
triplet pairing is present in a broad region around $n=2$. By contrast, singlet superconductivity
(with $d$-wave symmetry) is detected only for small values of the Hund coupling and very close to
half filling. When including magnetic and orbital order, the Mott insulator acquires antiferromagnetic
order for $n=2$; instead, for $n=1$ the insulator has ferromagnetic and antiferro-orbital orders.
In the latter case, a metallic phase is present for small values of $U/t$ and the metal-insulator
transition becomes first order. In the region with $1<n<2$, we observe that ferromagnetism (with
no orbital order) is particularly robust for large values of the Coulomb repulsion and that triplet
superconductivity is strongly suppressed by the presence of antiferromagnetism. The case with
$J=0$, which has an enlarged SU(4) symmetry due to the interplay between spin and orbital degrees
of freedom, is also analyzed.
