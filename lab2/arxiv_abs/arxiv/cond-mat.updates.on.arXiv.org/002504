In this study, we use discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulation to investigate the effect
of heterogeneous dislocation density on the transition between quasi-elastic deformation and
plastic flow in face-centered cubic single crystals. By analyzing the stress-strain curves of
samples with an initial, axial dislocation density gradient, we arrive at the following conclusions:
(i) in the regime of quasi-elastic deformation before the onset of plastic flow, the effective elastic
modulus of the simulated samples falls significantly below the value for a dislocation-free crystal.
This modulus reduction increases with decreasing dislocation density gradient: crystals with
homogeneous dislocation distribution are thus weakest in the quasi-elastic regime; (ii) the transition
towards plastic flow occurs first in regions of reduced dislocation density. Therefore, the overall
yield stress decreases with increasing dislocation density gradient; (iii) crystals with dislocation
density gradient exhibit a more pronounced hardening stage during which stress is re-distributed
onto stronger regions with higher dislocation density until the sample flows at a constant flow
stress that is approximately independent on dislocation density gradient. We interpret these
findings in terms of a continuum dislocation dynamics inspired model of dislocation density evolution
that accounts for inversive dislocation motions. The transition between quasi-elastic and plastic
deformation is interpreted as a transition from inversive to non-inversive dislocation motion,
and the initial differences in elastic modulus are related to a density dependent polarizability
of the dislocation system. The subsequent plastic flow behavior is analyzed in terms of a modified
version of Mughrabi's composite model.
