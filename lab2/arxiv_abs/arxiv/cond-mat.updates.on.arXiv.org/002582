Quasi-one-dimensional lattice systems such as flux ladders with artificial gauge fields host
rich quantum-phase diagrams that have attracted great interest. However, so far, most of the work
on these systems has concentrated on zero-temperature phases while the corresponding finite-temperature
regime remains largely unexplored. The question if and up to which temperature characteristic
features of the zero-temperature phases persist is relevant for ultracold quantum-gas experiments.
We investigate a two-leg ladder lattice in a uniform magnetic field and concentrate our study on
chiral edge currents and momentum-distribution functions, both key observables that are experimentally
accessible. These quantities are computed for hard-core bosons as well as non-interacting bosons
and spinless fermions at zero and finite temperatures. We employ a matrix-product-state based
purification approach for the simulation of strongly interacting bosons at finite temperatures
and analyze finite-size effects. Our main results concern the vortex-fluid-to-Meissner crossover
of strongly interacting bosons. We demonstrate that signatures of the vortex-fluid phase can still
be detected at elevated temperatures from characteristic finite-momentum maxima in the momentum-distribution
functions, while the vortex-fluid phase leaves weaker fingerprints in the local rung currents
and the chiral edge current. In order to determine the range of temperatures over which these signatures
can be observed, we introduce a suitable measure for the contrast of these maxima. The results are
condensed into a finite-temperature crossover diagram for hard-core bosons.
