Bacterial quorum sensing is the communication that takes place between bacteria as they secrete
certain molecules into the intercellular medium that later get absorbed by the secreting cells
themselves and by others. Depending on cell density, this uptake has the potential to alter gene
expression and thereby affect global properties of the community. We consider the case of multiple
bacterial species coexisting, referring to each one of them as a genotype and adopting the usual
denomination of the molecules they collectively secrete as public goods. A crucial problem in this
setting is characterizing the coevolution of genotypes as some of them secrete public goods (and
pay the associated metabolic costs) while others do not but may nevertheless benefit from the available
public goods. We introduce a network model to describe genotype interaction and evolution when
genotype fitness depends on the production and uptake of public goods. The model comprises a random
graph to summarize the possible evolutionary pathways the genotypes may take as they interact genetically
with one another, and a system of coupled differential equations to characterize the behavior of
genotype abundance in time. We study some simple variations of the model analytically and more complex
variations computationally. Our results point to a simple trade-off affecting the long-term survival
of those genotypes that do produce public goods. This trade-off involves, on the producer side,
the impact of producing and that of absorbing the public good. On the non-producer side, it involves
the impact of absorbing the public good as well, now compounded by the molecular compatibility between
the producer and the non-producer. Depending on how these factors turn out, producers may or may
not survive.
