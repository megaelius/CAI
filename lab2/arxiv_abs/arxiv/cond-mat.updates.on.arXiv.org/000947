We develop a non-singular theory of three-dimensional dislocation loops in a particular version
of Mindlin's anisotropic gradient elasticity with up to six length scale parameters. The theory
is systematically developed as a generalization of the classical anisotropic theory in the framework
of linearized incompatible elasticity. The non-singular version of all key equations of anisotropic
dislocation theory are derived as line integrals, including the Burgers displacement equation
with isolated solid angle, the Peach-Koehler stress equation, the Mura-Willis equation for the
elastic distortion, and the Peach-Koehler force. The expression for the interaction energy between
two dislocation loops as a double line integral is obtained directly, without the use of a stress
function. It is shown that all the elastic fields are non-singular, and that they converge to their
classical counterparts a few characteristic lengths away from the dislocation core. In practice,
the non-singular fields can be obtained from the classical ones by replacing the classical (singular)
anisotropic Green's tensor with the non-singular anisotropic Green's tensor derived by \cite{Lazar:2015ja}.
The elastic solution is valid for arbitrary anisotropic media. In addition to the classical anisotropic
elastic constants, the non-singular Green's tensor depends on a second order symmetric tensor
of length scale parameters modeling a weak non-locality, whose structure depends on the specific
class of crystal symmetry. The anisotropic Helmholtz operator defined by such tensor admits a Green's
function which is used as the spreading function for the Burgers vector density. As a consequence,
the Burgers vector density spreads differently in different crystal structures.
