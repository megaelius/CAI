Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires with Rashba spin-orbit coupling are arguably
becoming the leading platform for the search of Majorana bound states (MBSs) in engineered topological
superconductors. We perform a systematic numerical study of the low-energy Andreev spectrum and
supercurrents in short and long superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions made of nanowires
with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, where an external Zeeman field is applied perpendicular
to the spin-orbit axis. In particular, we investigate the detailed evolution of the Andreev bound
states from the trivial into the topological phase and their relation with the emergence of MBSs.
Due to finite length, the system hosts four MBSs, two at the inner part of the junction and two at the
outer one. They hybridize and give rise to a finite energy splitting at superconducting phase difference
$\phi=\pi$, a well-visible effect that can be traced back to the evolution of the energy spectrum
with the Zeeman field: from the trivial phase with Andreev bound states into the topological phase
with MBSs. Similarly, we carry out a detailed study of supercurrents for short and long junctions
from the trivial to the topological phases. The supercurrent, calculated from the Andreev spectrum,
is $2\pi$-periodic in the trivial and topological phases. In the latter it exhibits a clear \emph{sawtooth}
profile at phase difference of $\pi$ when the energy splitting is negligible, signalling a strong
dependence of current-phase curves on the length of the superconducting regions. Effects of temperature,
scalar disorder and reduction of normal transmission on supercurrents are also discussed. Further,
we identify the individual contribution of MBSs. In short junctions the MBSs determine the current-phase
curves, while in long junctions the spectrum above the gap (quasi-continuum) introduces an important
contribution.
