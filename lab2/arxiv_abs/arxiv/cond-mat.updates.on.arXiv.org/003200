In addition to the self-governing properties, tiny-sized particles of metallic colloids are the
building blocks of large-sized particles. This study has been the subject of many studies. A tiny-sized
particle developed at the solution surface or inside depends on the attained dynamics of atoms,
where different mechanisms of their bindings occur. When protocol energy is supplied to transitional
state atoms of monolayer assembly, it binds them in its own shape. Atoms of one-dimensional arrays
elongate uniformly under forced exertion of electrons along the opposite poles to form structures
of smooth elements of tiny particles. At solution surface, impinging electron streams at a fixed
angle results in elongating further the already elongated atoms of structures of smooth elements
through gained forced energy of carried photons. Travelling photons of different forcing energies
along the air-solution interface further shape structures of smooth elements. Inside the solution
or near interface, gold atoms also form tiny particles of different shaped structure, where in addition
to their attained dynamics, miscellaneous factors contribute, too. Again, suitably amalgamated
gold atoms when in the neutral state, they execute confined inter-state electron dynamics to self-generate
bind energy, where they are not required to be uplifted at solution surface for binding under protocol
energy. Tiny-sized particles evolve structures in the original format instead of developing structures
if localized dynamics of atoms favor execution of the electron dynamics where they do not require
nano-energy to design structures. This study highlights the fundamental process of formation
of different tiny particles where electronic structure, phase transition and localized dynamics
of gold atoms influence. Such a tool of processing materials opens several possibilities
