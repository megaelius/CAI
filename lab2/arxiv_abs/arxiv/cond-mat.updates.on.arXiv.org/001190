Localized laser heating creates temperature gradients in all directions and thus leads to three-dimensional
electron flux in metallic materials. Temperature gradients in combination with material magnetization
generate thermomagnetic voltages. The interplay between these direction-dependent temperature
gradients and the magnetization along with their control enable to manipulate the generated voltages,
e.g. in magnetic nanodevices. We identify the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generated on a nanometer
length scale by micrometer sized temperature gradients in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). In
a systematic study, we extract the ANE by analyzing the influence of in-plane temperature gradients
on the tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect (TMS) in three dimensional devices. To investigate these
effects, we utilize in-plane magnetized MTJs based on CoFeB electrodes with an MgO tunnel barrier.
Due to our measurement configuration, there is no necessity to disentangle the ANE from the spin
Seebeck effect in inverse spin-Hall measurements. The temperature gradients are created by a tightly
focused laser spot. The spatial extent of the measured effects is defined by the MTJ size, while the
spatial resolution is given by the laser spot size and the step size of its lateral translation. This
method is highly sensitive to low voltages and yields an ANE coefficient of $K_N\approx 1.6\cdot
10^{-8}\,\mathrm{V/TK}$ for CoFeB. In general, TMS investigations in MTJs are motivated by the
usage of otherwise wasted heat in magnetic memory devices for read/write operations. Here, the
additionally generated ANE effect allows to expand the MTJs' functionality from simple memory
storage to nonvolatile logic devices and opens new application fields such as direction dependent
temperature sensing with the potential for further downscaling.
