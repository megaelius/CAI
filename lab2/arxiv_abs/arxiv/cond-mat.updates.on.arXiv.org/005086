We use broadband ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of Ta$_{2}$NiSe$_{5}$.
This layered chalcogenide material has recently been shown to host an excitonic insulating phase
up to a critical temperature T$_{c}$ = 328 K, however the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking
leading to the excitonic condensation, whether electronic or structural, is unknown. Here, we
first demonstrate that the transient reflectivity (${\Delta}$R/R) in the near infrared range
is connected to the low-energy dynamics of the excitonic order. In particular, ${\Delta}$R/R mirrors
the behaviour of the order parameter of a symmetry broken phase, and changes sign as the temperature
is raised across T$_{c}$. This enables us to track the status of the excitonic condensate and to show
that the transient response above T$_{c}$ is that of a gapped state, supporting the recently proposed
existence of a novel insulating phase of preformed excitons at high temperatures. We further demonstrate
that the condensate is also suppressed at room temperature in the presence of high photoexcitation
fluences. From the sub-50 fs, fluence dependent timescale of the condensate quenching and from
the behaviour of the photoinduced coherent phonon modes, we conclude that electronic interactions
prominently underlie the formation of the excitonic order. The observation of a sub-2 ps recovery
of the symmetry broken phase confirms this conclusion and is of particular interest as this process
is usually hindered by photoinduced heating in other strongly correlated materials. Our results
therefore pave the way towards the ultrafast, complete control and manipulation of an exciton condensate
at room temperature.
