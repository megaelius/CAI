Reproducing the electronic structure of AM$_4$X$_8$ lacunar spinels with a breathing pyrochlore
lattice is a great theoretical challenge due to the interplay of various factors. The character
of the M$_4$X$_4$ cluster orbitals is critically influenced by the Jahn-Teller instability, the
spin-orbit interaction and also by the magnetic state of the clusters. Consequently, to reproduce
the narrow-gap semiconducting nature of these moderately correlated materials requires advanced
approaches, since the strength of the inter-cluster hopping is strongly influenced by the character
of the cluster orbitals. In order to provide a solid experimental basis for theoretical studies,
we performed a broadband optical spectroscopy on a large set of lacunar spinels, with systematically
changing ions at the A and M sites as well as the ligand (A=Ga, Ge, Al; M=V, Mo, Nb, Ta; X=S, Se). Our study
covers the range of phonon excitations and also electronic transitions near the gap edge. In the
phonon excitation spectrum a limited subset of the symmetry allowed modes are observed in the cubic
state, with few additional modes emerging upon the symmetry-lowering structural transition.
All the infrared active modes are assigned to vibrations of the ligands and ions at the A sites, while
the M$_4$ clusters seem to be silent. Concerning the electronic states, we found that all compounds
are narrow-gap semiconductors ($E_{g} = 130 - 350$ meV) already in their room-temperature cubic
state and their structural transitions induce weak, if any, changes in the charge gap. The gap value
is decreased when substituting S with Se and also when replacing $3d$ ions by $4d$ or $5d$ ions at the
M sites.
