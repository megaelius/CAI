The phenomenon whereby atoms deal a positive or negative charge by losing or gaining one or more electrons
forms the basis of familiar processes. However, those atoms which comprise unfilled state for electron,
they execute electron-dynamics under certain force-energy behavior and do not ionize. At ground
surface level, atoms of many elements under certain transition state elongate along opposite poles
from the centers as per exertion of surface format force. Splitting of atoms not executing electronic
transition to electron streams under excess propagation of photonic current and fixed angle impingement
of electrons to elongated atoms result into their further elongation as per transported punched
forcing energy. When electrons of punched forcing energy do not impinge at fixed angle to naturally
elongated atoms, it results into the deformation of elongated atoms as stretching of energy knots
clamped electron states does not remain orientational-based where exertion force of electrons
remains under non-uniform frictional behavior. In the case of inert gas atoms, an alternative process
takes place. Atoms of inert gas under certain flow rate split into electron streams while surplus
propagation of photonic current to inter-state electron gap, thus, on increasing wavelength of
travelling photons to visible range reveal the light glow. In silicon solar cells and other similar
kind gadgets, photonic current is generated. All sorts of microscopes visualizing the topography
image is due to certain pace of reflected photons. The selected area patterns specify that spotted
dots are due to spotting reflected photons which are controlled at certain pace when interact to
surface of interest. Many phenomena are discussed inferring photonic current instead of electric.
These fundamental revolutions bring vast changes in the existing state of science.
