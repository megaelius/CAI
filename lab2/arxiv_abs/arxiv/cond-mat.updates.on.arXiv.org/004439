The excellent mechanical properties of the Ni-based superalloy IN718 mainly result from coherent
$\gamma''$ precipitates. Due to a strongly anisotropic lattice misfit between the matrix and the
precipitate phase, the particles exhibit pronounced plate-shaped morphologies. Using a phase-field
model, we investigate various influencing factors that determine the equilibrium shapes of $\gamma"$
precipitates, minimizing the sum of the total elastic and interfacial energy. Upon increasing
precipitate phase fractions, the model predicts increasingly stronger particle-particle interactions,
leading to shapes with significantly increased aspect ratios. Matching the a priori unknown interfacial
energy density to fit experimental $\gamma"$ shapes is sensitive to the phase content imposed in
the underlying model. Considering vanishing phase content leads to 30% lower estimates of the interfacial
energy density, as compared to estimates based on realistic phase fractions of 12%. We consider
the periodic arrangement of precipitates in different hexagonal and rectangular superstructures,
which result from distinct choices of point-symmetric and periodic boundary conditions. Further,
non-volume conserving boundary conditions are implemented to compensate for strains due to an
anisotropic lattice mismatch between the $\gamma$ matrix and the $\gamma''$ precipitate. As compared
to conventional boundary conditions, this specifically tailored simulation configuration does
not conflict with the systems periodicity and provides substantially more realistic total elastic
energies at high precipitate volume fractions. The energetically most favorable superstructure
is found to be a hexagonal precipitate arrangement.
