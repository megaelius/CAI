Controlling the shape and structure of metallic colloids is an important topic. Here, different
morphologies-structures of colloidal gold particles are investigated for different process
parameters in a pulse-based electron-photon-solution interface process. Different tiny-shaped
particles of gold are developed for different types of nano-energy. Depending on the set ratios
of pulse OFF to ON times and pulse polarity, packets of nano-energy assemble largely transitional-state
atoms of gold monolayer assembly in their own shapes. Tiny particles in joined triangular-shape
are developed under appropriate set ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON time. At unipolar pulse, tiny
particles of a triangular-shape are developed directly. When the ratio of bipolar pulse OFF to ON
time was at large difference, distorted shapes of the particles developed. Geometric anisotropic
shapes of particles developed under appropriate ratios of pulse OFF to ON times. When the ratio of
bipolar pulse OFF to ON time was 3, particles get developed in low aspect ratio. But under the fraction
of this ratio, particles get developed in high aspect ratio. For longer pulse ON time, structures
of smooth elements get developed in width less than inter-spacing distance and travelling photons
along interface flat them further. When elongated atoms of tiny particles deformed largely, they
did not form structures of smooth elements even for the case of travelling photons along their interface.
Morphology and structure of tiny particles, nanoparticles and particles are discussed for different
process parameters opening multiple routes of materials research and their counterparts. This
is the overall attained orientation of electrons for their elongated atoms forming colloidal particles
of different size and shape, which maintains the certain color of solution under sunlight.
