The purpose of the present article is to make a model using analytical equations, based on elasticity
theory of continuous media for small deformations, with the aim of completely characterizing the
material in their mechanical properties as well as the principal stresses-strains of thin films.
The approach differs from the standard literature which usually brings crystal symmetries or is
directly concerned with crystalline materials. It is entirely possible to define and to analyze
anisotropy in elastic media from first principles in thin films. Therefore, the constitutive relation
between strain and stress will be considered orthotropic, obeying the generalized Hooke's law.
A new equation for the stress of the film-substrate system is proposed based on Newton's laws and
energy conservation. As an application, it use the technique and data developed by Faurie et al (2005)
in fiber-textured gold film deposited onto Kapton substrate by combining synchrotron X-Ray diffraction
in situ tensile testing. As the gold thin film and substrate are considered transversely isotropic,
therefore, is firstly required a texture analysis with the purpose of determining the possible
Euler angles ($\phi$) and ($\psi$) for each crystallographic direction that can be used in the model
equations. With the data, it is possible to make graphics, $\varepsilon$ (strain) X F, for every
force applied to the sample. Comparing the experimental graphs with the theoretical equations
it was possible obtained their mechanical properties and the principal stresses-strains of the
anisotropic gold thin film. The results are compared with the results of Faurie et al (2005).
