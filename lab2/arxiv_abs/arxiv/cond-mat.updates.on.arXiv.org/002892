The mixed spin-1 and spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with regularly alternating monomeric
spin-1 sites and square-plaquette spin-1/2 sites is investigated using variational technique,
localized-magnon approach, exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group
method. The investigated model has in a magnetic field an extraordinarily rich ground-state phase
diagram, which includes the uniform and cluster-based Haldane phases, two ferrimagnetic phases
of Lieb-Mattis type, two quantum spin liquids and two bound magnon crystals in addition to the fully
polarized ferromagnetic phase. The lowest-energy eigenstates in a highly-frustrated parameter
region belong to flat bands and hence, low-temperature thermodynamics close to discontinuous
field-driven quantum phase transitions related to the bound-magnon crystals and ferromagnetic
ground states can be satisfactorily described within the localized-magnon approach. The variational
method provides an exact evidence for the magnon-crystal phase with a character of the monomer-tetramer
ground state at zero magnetic field, while another magnon-crystal phase involving a single magnon
bound state at each square plaquette is found in a high-field region. A diversity of quantum ground
states gives rise to manifold zero-temperature magnetization curves, which may involve up to four
wide intermediate plateaus at zero, one-sixth, one-third and two-thirds of the saturation magnetization
in addition to two quantum spin-liquid regions and two tiny plateaus at one-ninth and one-twelfth
of the saturation magnetization corresponding to the fragmentized cluster-based Haldane phases.
