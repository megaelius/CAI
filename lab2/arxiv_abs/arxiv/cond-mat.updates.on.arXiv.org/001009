Miniaturized, self-propelled locomotors use chemo-mechanical transduction mechanisms to convert
fuel in the environment to autonomous motion. Recent experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate
that these autonomous engines can passively follow the contours of solid boundaries they encounter.
Boundary guidance, however, is not necessarily stable: Mechanical disturbances can cause the
motor to hydrodynamically depart from the passively guided pathway. Furthermore, given the scaled-down
size of micromotors (typically 100 nm -10 $\mu$m), Brownian thermal fluctuation forces are necessarily
important and these stochastic forces can randomize passively-steered trajectories. Here we
examine theoretically the stability of boundary guided motion of micromotors along infinite planar
walls to mechanical disturbances and to Brownian forces. Our aim is to understand under what conditions
this passively guided motion is stable. We choose a locomotor design in which spherical colloids
are partially coated with a catalytic cap that reacts with solute to produce a product. The product
is repelled from the particle surface, causing the particle to move with the inert face at the front
(autonomous motion via self-diffusiophoresis). When propelled towards a planar wall, deterministic
hydrodynamic studies demonstrate that these locomotors can exhibit, for large enough cap sizes,
steady trajectories in which the particle either skims unidirectionally along the surface at a
constant distance from the wall, or becomes stationary. We first investigate the linear hydrodynamic
stability of these states by expanding the equations of motion about the states, and find that linear
perturbations decay exponentially in time. We then study the effects of thermal fluctuations by
formulating a Langevin equation for the particle motion which includes the Brownian stochastic
force...
