We study classical percolation models in Fock space as proxies for the quantum many-body localisation
(MBL) transition. Percolation rules are defined for two models of disordered quantum spin-chains
using their microscopic quantum Hamiltonians and the topologies of the associated Fock-space
graphs. The percolation transition is revealed by the statistics of Fock-space cluster sizes,
obtained by exact enumeration for finite-sized systems. As a function of disorder strength, the
typical cluster size shows a transition from a volume law in Fock space to sub-volume law, directly
analogous to the behaviour of eigenstate participation entropies across the MBL transition. Finite-size
scaling analyses for several diagnostics of cluster size statistics yield mutually consistent
critical properties. We show further that local observables averaged over Fock-space clusters
also carry signatures of the transition, with their behaviour across it in direct analogy to that
of corresponding eigenstate expectation values across the MBL transition. The Fock-space clusters
can be explored under a mapping to kinetically constrained models. Dynamics within this framework
likewise show the ergodicity-breaking transition via Monte Carlo averaged local observables,
and yield critical properties consistent with those obtained from both exact cluster enumeration
and analytic results derived in our recent work [arXiv:1812.05115]. This mapping allows access
to system sizes two orders of magnitude larger than those accessible in exact enumerations. Simple
physical pictures based on freezing of local real-space segments of spins are also presented, and
shown to give values for the critical disorder strength and correlation length exponent $\nu$ consistent
with numerical studies.
