Equilibrium states of a closed semiflexible polymer binding to a cylinder are described. This may
be either by confinement or by constriction. Closed completely bound states are labeled by two integers:
the number of oscillations, $n$, and the number of times it winds the cylinder, $p$, the latter a topological
invariant. We examine the behavior of these states as the length of the loop is increased by evaluating
the energy, the conserved axial torque and the contact force. The ground state for a given $p$ is the
state with $n=1$; a short loop with $p=1$ is an elliptic deformation of a parallel; as its length increases
it elongates along the cylinder axis, with two hairpin ends. Excited states with $n\geq2$ and $p=1$
possess $n$-fold axial symmetry. Short (long) loops possess energies $\approx p E_0$ ($nE_0$),
with $E_0$ the energy of a circular loop with same radius as the cylinder; in long loops the axial torque
vanishes. Confined bound excited states are initially unstable; however, above a critical length
each $n$-fold state becomes stable: the folded hairpin cannot be unfolded. The ground state for
each $p$ is also initially unstable with respect to deformations rotating the loop off the surface
into the interior. A closed planar elastic curve aligned along the cylinder axis making contact
with the cylinder on its two sides is identified as the ground state of a confined loop. Exterior bound
states behave very differently, if free to unbind, as signaled by the reversal in the sign of the contact
force. If $p=1$, all such states are unstable. If $p \geq 2$, however, a topological obstruction
to complete unbinding exists. If the loop is short, the bound state with $p=2$ and $n=1$ provides
a stable constriction of the cylinder, partially unbinding as the length is increased. This motif
could be relevant to an understanding of the process of membrane fission mediated by dynamin rings.
