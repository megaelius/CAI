The stability of alkane-in-water nanoemulsions during the sub-stationary regime is studied by
means of Emulsion Stability Simulations (ESS). The effects of Ostwald ripening, flocculation,
coalescence, gravity, and hydration forc- es are considered. According to these calculations
flocculation and coalescence are predominant during the first few seconds after the preparation
of the emulsion. This favors the generation of a right-skewed Drop Size Distribu- tion (DSD). As
the system evolves, the drops grow larger and more repulsive causing a slow down of the flocculation
process. In the case of dodecane (C12) and hexadecane (C16) the referred phenomena, reinforce the
ripening trend to subvert the initial DSD variation, producing a meta-stable distribution which
is preserved during several minutes. After this time, Ostwald ripening dominates: the skirt of
the distribution changes progressively from right-skewed to left-skewed. Consistent with these
changes, the cube average radius of the emulsion increases rapidly at first, but progressively
diminishes generating a concave-downward curve that stabilizes asymptotically. In the case of
dodecane and hexadecane the complete dissolution of the drops promoted by ripening is prevented
at all times due to coalescence. In the case of octane (C8) a substantial amount of drops is lost by
dissolution, forbidding the attain- ment of a stable DSD. In all cases the molecular exchange only
favors a decrease of the average radius as a function of time. It is the elimination of drops either
by dissolution or coalescence which causes an increase of the average radius of the emulsion.
