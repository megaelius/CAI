Quantum statistics and symmetrization dictate that identical fermions do not interact via s-wave
collisions. However, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), fermions prepared in identical
internal states with distinct momenta become distinguishable. The resulting strongly interacting
system can exhibit exotic topological and pairing behaviors, many of which are yet to be observed
in condensed matter systems. Ultracold atomic gases offer a promising pathway for simulating these
rich phenomena. Two recent experiments reported the observation of single atom SOC in optical lattice
clocks (OLCs) based on alkaline-earth atoms. In these works encoding the effective spin degree
of freedom in the long-lived electronic clock states significantly reduced the detrimental effects
of spontaneous emission and heating that have thus far hindered the study of interacting SOC with
alkali atoms. Beyond first studies of interacting SOC with alkali atoms in a bulk gas and with two
particles in a lattice, here we enter a new regime of many-body interacting SOC in an OLC. Using clock
spectroscopy, we observe the precession of the collective magnetization and the emergence of spin
locking effects arising from an interplay between p-wave and SOC-induced exchange interactions.
The many-body dynamics are well captured by a collective XXZ spin model, which describes a broad
class of condensed matter systems ranging from superconductors to quantum magnets. Furthermore,
our work will aid in the design of next-generation OLCs by offering a route for avoiding the observed
large density shifts caused by SOC-induced exchange interactions.
