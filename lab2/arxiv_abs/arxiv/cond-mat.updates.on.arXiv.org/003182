Analysis of distortions of the crystal lattice within individual mineral grains is central to the
investigation of microscale processes that control and record tectonic events. These distortions
are generally combinations of lattice rotations and elastic strains, but a lack of suitable observational
techniques has prevented these components being mapped simultaneously and routinely in earth
science laboratories. However, the technique of high-angular resolution electron backscatter
diffraction (HR-EBSD) provides the opportunity to simultaneously map lattice rotations and elastic
strains with exceptional precision, on the order of 0.01 degree for rotations and 10-4 in strain,
using a scanning electron microscope. Importantly, these rotations and lattice strains relate
to densities of geometrically necessary dislocations and residual stresses. Recent works have
begun to apply and adapt HR-EBSD to geological minerals, highlighting the potential of the technique
to provide new insights into the microphysics of rock deformation. Therefore, the purpose of this
overview is to provide a summary of the technique, to identify caveats and targets for further development,
and to suggest areas where it offers potential for major advances. In particular, HREBSD is well
suited to characterising the roles of different dislocation types during crystal plastic deformation
and to mapping heterogeneous internal stress fields associated with specific deformation mechanisms/microstructures
or changes in temperature, confining pressure, or applied deviatoric stress. These capabilities
make HR-EBSD a particularly powerful new technique for analysing the microstructures of deformed
geological materials.
