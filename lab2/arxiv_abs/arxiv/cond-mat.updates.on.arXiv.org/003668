Despite metals are believed to be insensitive to field-effect and conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) theories predict the electric field to be ineffective on conventional superconductors,
a number of gating experiments showed the possibility of modulating the conductivity of metallic
thin films and the critical temperature of conventional superconductors. All these experimental
features have been explained by simple charge accumulation/depletion. In 2018, electric field
control of supercurrent in conventional metallic superconductors has been demonstrated in a range
of electric fields where the induced variation of charge carrier concentration in metals is negligibly
small. In fact, no changes of normal state resistance and superconducting critical temperature
were reported. Here, we review the experimental results obtained in the realization of field-effect
metallic superconducting devices exploiting this unexplained phenomenon. We will start by presenting
the seminal results on superconducting BCS wires and nano-constriction Josephson junctions (Dayem
bridges) made of different materials, such as titanium, aluminum and vanadium. Then, we show the
mastering of the Josephson supercurrent in superconductor-normal metal-superconductor proximity
transistors suggesting that the presence of induced superconducting correlations are enough
to see this unconventional field-effect. Later, we present the control of the interference pattern
in a superconducting quantum interference device indicating the coupling of the electric field
with thesuperconducting phase. Among the possible applications of the presented phenomenology,
we conclude this review by proposing some devices that may represent a breakthrough in superconducting
quantum and classical computation.
