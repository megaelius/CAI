We study the topological properties of superconductors with paired $j=\frac{3}{2}$ quasiparticles.
Higher spin Fermi surfaces can arise, for instance, in strongly spin-orbit coupled band-inverted
semimetals. Examples include the Bi-based half-Heusler materials, which have recently been established
as low-temperature and low-carrier density superconductors. Motivated by this experimental
observation, we obtain a comprehensive symmetry-based classification of topological pairing
states in systems with higher angular momentum Cooper pairing. Our study consists of two main parts.
First, we develop the phenomenological theory of multicomponent (i.e., higher angular momentum)
pairing by classifying the stationary points of the free energy within a Ginzburg-Landau framework.
Based on the symmetry classification of stationary pairing states, we then derive the symmetry-imposed
constraints on their gap structures. We find that, depending on the symmetry quantum numbers of
the Cooper pairs, different types of topological pairing states can occur: fully gapped topological
superconductors in class DIII, Dirac superconductors and superconductors hosting Majorana fermions.
Notably, we find a series of nematic fully gapped topological superconductors, as well as double-Dirac
superconductors with quadratic dispersion. Our approach, applied here to the case of $j=\frac{3}{2}$
Cooper pairing, is rooted in the symmetry properties of pairing states, and can therefore also be
applied to other systems with higher angular momentum and high-spin pairing. We conclude by relating
our results to experimentally accessible signatures in thermodynamic and dynamic probes.
