We investigate field quantization in high-curvature geometries. The models and calculations
can help with understanding the elastic and inelastic scattering of photons and electrons in nanostructures
and probe-like metallic domains. The results find important applications in high-resolution
photonic and electronic modalities of scanning probe microscopy, nano-optics, plasmonics, and
quantum sensing. Quasistatic formulation, leading to nonretarded quantities, is employed and
justified on the basis of the nanoscale, here subwavelength, dimensions of the considered domains
of interest. Within the quasistatic framework, we represent the nanostructure material domains
with frequency-dependent dielectric functions. Quantities associated with the normal modes
of the electronic systems, the nonretarded plasmon dispersion relations, eigenmodes, and fields
are then calculated for several geometric entities of use in nanoscience and nanotechnology. From
the classical energy of the charge density oscillations in the modeled nanoparticle, we then derive
the Hamiltonian of the system, which is used for quantization. The quantized plasmon field is obtained
and, employing an interaction Hamiltonian derived from the first-order perturbation theory within
the hydrodynamic model of the electron gas, we obtain an analytical expression for the radiative
decay rate of the plasmons. The established treatment is applied to multiple geometries to investigate
the quantized charge density oscillations on their bounding surfaces. Specifically, using one
sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid of revolution, paraboloid of revolution, and cylindrical domains,
all with one infinite dimension, and the finite spheroidal and toroidal domains are treated. ...
