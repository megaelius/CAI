We classify distinct types of quantum number fractionalization occurring in two-dimensional
topologically ordered phases, focusing in particular on phases with Z2 topological order, that
is, on gapped Z2 spin liquids. We find that the fractionalization class of each anyon is an equivalence
class of projective representations of the symmetry group, corresponding to elements of the cohomology
group H^2(G,Z2). This result leads us to a symmetry classification of gapped Z2 spin liquids, such
that two phases in different symmetry classes cannot be connected without breaking symmetry or
crossing a phase transition. Symmetry classes are defined by specifying a fractionalization class
for each type of anyon. The fusion rules of anyons play a crucial role in determining the symmetry
classes. For translation and internal symmetry, braiding statistics plays no role, but can affect
the classification when point group symmetries are present. For square lattice space group, time
reversal and SO(3) spin rotation symmetry, we find 2,098,176 ~ 2^21 distinct symmetry classes.
We give an explicit construction of symmetry classes for square lattice space group symmetry in
the toric code model. Via simple examples, we illustrate how information about fractionalization
classes can in principle be obtained from the spectrum and quantum numbers of excited states. Moreover,
the symmetry class can be partially determined from the quantum numbers of the four degenerate ground
states on the torus. We also extend our results to arbitrary Abelian topological orders, and compare
our classification with the related projective symmetry group classification of parton mean-field
theories. Our results provide a framework for understanding and probing the sharp distinctions
among symmetric Z2 spin liquids, and are a first step toward a full classification of symmetric topologically
ordered phases.
