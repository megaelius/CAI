Here, we report self flux single crystal growth of FeTe1-xSex for x = 0 to 0.50 series via solid state
reaction route,the resulted crystals as seen are shiny. X Ray diffraction performed on the surface
of crystals elucidated the growth in 00l plane, i.e. orientation in c direction only. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images showed slab like morphology and EDX (Energy dispersive X ray analyzer)
confirmed that the crystals are closed to their designed compositions. Rietveld analysis of the
XRD patterns of crushed crystal powders showed that the cell parameters decrease with Se content
increase. Coupled magnetic and structural phase transition temperature, seen as a step in resistivity
for the lower Se concentration and it is not detected for higher x values. Superconductivity is observed
by resistivity measurement for higher Se concentration with a maximum temperature of 14K at x = 0.50.
Thermally Activated Flux Flow (TAFF) analysis based on high field transport measurements in superconducting
region done for x = 0.20 crystal. Raman spectroscopy at room temperature of synthesized samples
exhibits all the allowed phonon modes with slight shift to higher frequency with Se content. Mossbauer
spectra of FeTe1-xSex crystals series were recorded at 300 and 5K. At 5K, the average hyperfine field
decreases systematically with Se content increase from 10.6 to 6.1Tesla for x = 0.0 to x = 0.20 samples.
This indicates a possibility of co-existing magnetism and superconductivity in x = 0.07 to 0.20
crystals. For x = 0.50 sample, no hyperfine field related to magnetic ordering is seen. Based on above
results, detailed phase diagram of the FeTe1-xSex compounds is defined in the present study.
