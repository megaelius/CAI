Monte Carlo computer simulations are used to study the conformational free energy of a folded polymer
confined to a long cylindrical tube. The polymer is modeled as a hard-sphere chain. Its conformational
free energy $F$ is measured as a function of $\lambda$, the end-to-end distance of the polymer. In
the case of a flexible linear polymer, $F(\lambda)$ is a linear function in the folded regime with
a gradient that scales as $f\equiv |dF/d\lambda| \sim N^0 D^{-1.20\pm 0.01}$ for a tube of diameter
$D$ and a polymer of length $N$. This is close to the prediction $f \sim N^0 D^{-1}$ obtained from simple
scaling arguments. The discrepancy is due in part to finite-size effects associated with the de-Gennes
blob model. A similar discrepancy was observed for the folding of a single arm of a three-arm star
polymer. We also examine backfolding of a semiflexible polymer of persistence length $P$ in the
classic Odijk regime. In the overlap regime, the derivative scales $f \sim N^0 D^{-1.72\pm 0.02}
P^{-0.35\pm 0.01}$, which is close to the prediction $f \sim N^0 D^{-5/3} P^{-1/3}$ obtained from
a scaling argument that treats interactions between deflection segments at the second virial level.
In addition, the measured free energy cost of forming a hairpin turn is quantitatively consistent
with a recent theoretical calculation. Finally, we examine the scaling of $F(\lambda)$ for a confined
semiflexible chain in the presence of an S-loop composed of two hairpins. While the predicted scaling
of the free energy gradient is the same as that for a single hairpin, we observe a scaling of $f \sim
D^{-1.91\pm 0.03} P^{-0.36\pm 0.01}$. Thus, the quantitative discrepancy between this measurement
and the predicted scaling is somewhat greater for S-loops than for single hairpins.
