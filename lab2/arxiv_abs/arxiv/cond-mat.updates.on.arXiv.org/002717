Nowadays, a problem of historical beadworks conservation in museum collections is actual more
than ever because of fatal corrosion of the 19th century glass beads. Vibrational spectroscopy
is a powerful method for investigation of glass, namely, of correlation of the structure-chemical
composition. Therefore, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used for examination of
degradation processes in cloudy turquoise glass beads, which in contrast to other color ones deteriorate
especially strongly. Micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of samples has shown that lead-potassium
glass PbO-K$_2$O-SiO$_2$ with small amount of Cu and Sb was used for manufacture of cloudy turquoise
beads. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy study of the beads at different stages of glass
corrosion was carried out in the range from 200 to 4000 cm$^{-1}$ in the attenuated total reflection
mode. In all the spectra, we have observed shifts of two major absorption bands to low-frequency
range (~1000 and ~775 cm$^{-1}$) compared to ones typical for amorphous SiO2 (~1100 and 800 cm$^{-1}$,
respectively). Such an effect is connected with Pb$^{2+}$ and K$^+$ appending to the glass network.
The presence of a weak band at ~1630 cm$^{-1}$ in all the spectra is attributed to the adsorption of
H$_2$O. After annealing of the beads, the band disappeared completely in less deteriorated samples
and became significantly weaker in more destroyed ones. Based on that we conclude that there is adsorbed
molecular water on the beads. However, products of corrosion (e.g., alkali in the form of white crystals
or droplets of liquid alkali) were not observed on the glass surface. We have also observed glass
depolymerisation in the strongly degraded beads, which is exhibited in domination of the band peaked
at ~1000 cm$^{-1}$.
