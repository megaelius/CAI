The two main predictions of quantum field theory in curved space-time, namely Hawking radiation
and cosmological pair production, have not been directly tested and involve ultra high energy configurations.
As a consequence, they should be considered with caution. Using the analogy with condensed matter
systems, their analogue versions could be tested in the lab. Moreover, the high energy behavior
of these systems is known and involves dispersion and dissipation, which regulate the theory at
short distances. When considering experiments which aim to test the above predictions, there will
also be a competition between the stimulated emission from thermal noise and the spontaneous emission
out of vacuum. In order to measure these effects, one should thus compute the consequences of UV dispersion
and dissipation, and identify observables able to establish that the spontaneous emission took
place. In this thesis, we first analyze the effects of dispersion and dissipation on both Hawking
radiation and pair particle production. To get explicit results, we work in the context of de Sitter
space. Using the extended symmetries of the theory in such a background, exact results are obtained.
These are then transposed to the context of black holes using the correspondence between de Sitter
space and the black hole near horizon region. To introduce dissipation, we consider an exactly solvable
model producing any decay rate. We also study the quantum entanglement of the particles so produced.
In a second part, we consider explicit condensed matter systems, namely Bose Einstein condensates
and exciton-polariton systems. We analyze the effects of dissipation on entanglement produced
by the dynamical Casimir effect. As a final step, we study the entanglement of Hawking radiation
in the presence of dispersion for a generic analogue system.
