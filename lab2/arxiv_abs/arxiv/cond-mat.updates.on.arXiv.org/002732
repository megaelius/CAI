In the past years classical wave-systems have constituted an excellent platform for emulating
complex quantum phenomena. This approach has been especially fruitful in demonstrating topological
phenomena in photonics and acoustics: from chiral edge states of Chern insulators and helical edge
states of topological insulators to higher-dimensional topological states of quasiperiodic
systems and systems with synthetic dimensions. Recently, a new class of topological states localized
in more than one dimension of a D-dimensional system, referred to as higher-order topological (HOT)
states, has been reported, offering an even more versatile platform to confine and control classical
radiation and mechanical motion. However, because experimental research of HOT states has so far
been limited to two-dimensional (2D) systems, third and higher-order states have evaded experimental
observation. Studying higher-dimensional classical systems therefore opens an opportunity
to emulate higher-order topological insulators and explore HOT states beyond second order. In
this letter, we design and experimentally study a 3D acoustic metamaterial supporting third-order
(0D) topological corner states, along with second-order (1D) edge states within the same topological
bandgap, thus establishing a full hierarchy of HOT states in three dimensions, co-existing robustly
within the same topological bandgap. The metamaterial is implemented over a versatile additive
manufacturing platform, which enables rapid prototyping of metaatoms and metamolecules, which
can be snapped together to form 3D metamaterials with complex geometries. The assembled 3D topological
metamaterial represents the acoustic analogue of a pyrochlore lattice made of interconnected
molecules, and is shown to exhibit topological bulk polarization, leading to the emergence of topological
HOT states localized in all three or in two dimensions.
