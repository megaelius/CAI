We develop a prototypical stochastic model for local search around a given home. The stochastic
dynamic model is motivated by experimental findings of the motion of a fruit fly around a given spot
of food but shall generally describe local search behavior. The local search consists of a sequence
of two epochs. In the first the searcher explores new space around the home whereas it returns to the
home during the second epoch. In the proposed two dimensional model both tasks are described by the
same stochastic dynamics. The searcher moves with constant speed and its angular dynamics is driven
by a symmetric {\alpha}-stable noise source. The latter stands for the uncertainty to decide the
new direction of motion. The main ingredient of the model is the nonlinear interaction dynamics
of the searcher with its home. In order to determine the new heading direction, the angles of its position
to the home and of the heading vector need to be known. A bound state to the home is realized by a permanent
switch of a repulsive and attractive forcing of the heading direction from the position direction
corresponding to search and return epochs. Our investigation elucidates the analytic tractability
of the deterministic and stochastic dynamics. The noise enables a faster finding of a target distinct
from the home with optimal intensity. This optimal situation is related to the noise dependent relaxation
time. It is uniquely defined for all {\alpha} and distinguishes between the stochastic dynamics
before and after its value. For times large compared to this we derive the corresponding Smoluchowski
equation and find diffusive spreading of searcher in the space. As result of its simplicity the model
aims to reproduce the local search behavior of simple units during their exploration of surrounding
space and their quasi-periodic return to a home.
