We provide numerical evidence in favor of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the concomitant
appearance of an Abelian chiral spin liquid for three-component fermions on the triangular lattice
described by an SU(3) symmetric Hubbard model with hopping amplitude $-t$ ($t>0$) and on-site interaction
$U$. This chiral phase is stabilized in the Mott phase with one particle per site in the presence of
a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette, and in the Mott phase with two particles per site without any
flux. Our approach relies on effective spin models derived in the strong-coupling limit in powers
of $t/U$ for general SU$(N)$ and arbitrary uniform charge flux per plaquette, which are subsequently
studied using exact diagonalizations and variational Monte Carlo simulations for $N=3$, as well
as exact diagonalizations of the SU($3$) Hubbard model on small clusters. Up to third order in $t/U$,
and for the time-reversal symmetric cases (flux $0$ or $\pi$), the low-energy description is given
by the $J$-$K$ model with Heisenberg coupling $J$ and real ring exchange $K$. The phase diagram in
the full $J$-$K$ parameter range contains, apart from three already known, magnetically long-range
ordered phases, two previously unreported phases: i) a lattice nematic phase breaking the lattice
rotation symmetry and ii) a spontaneous time-reversal and parity symmetry breaking Abelian chiral
spin liquid. For the Hubbard model, an investigation that includes higher-order itinerancy effects
supports the presence of a phase transition inside the insulating region, occurring at $(t/U)_{\rm
c}\approx 0.07$ [$(U/t)_{\rm c} \approx 13$] between the three-sublattice magnetically ordered
phase at small $t/U$ and this Abelian chiral spin liquid.
