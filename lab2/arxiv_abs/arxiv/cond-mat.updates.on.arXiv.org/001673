Photonic materials are an emerging platform to explore quantum matter and quantum dynamics. The
development of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency provided a clear route to strong
interactions between individual optical photons. In conjunction with carefully designed optical
resonators, it is now possible to achieve extraordinary control of the properties of individual
photons, introducing tunable gauge fields whilst imbuing the photons with mass and embedding them
on curved spatial manifolds. Building on work formalizing Rydberg-mediated interactions between
propagating photons, we develop a theory of interacting Rydberg polaritons in multimode optical
resonators, where the strong interactions are married with tunable single-particle properties
to build and probe exotic matter. In the presence of strong coupling between the resonator field
and a Rydberg-dressed atomic ensemble, a quasiparticle called the "cavity Rydberg polariton"
emerges. We investigate its properties, finding that it inherits both the fast dynamics of its photonic
constituents and the strong interactions of its atomic constituents. We develop tools to properly
renormalize the interactions when polaritons approach each other, and investigate the impact
of atomic motion on the coherence of multi-mode polaritons, showing that most channels for atom-polariton
cross-thermalization are strongly suppressed. Finally, we propose to harness the repeated diffraction
and refocusing of the optical resonator to realize interactions which are local in momentum space.
This work points the way to efficient modeling of polaritonic quantum materials in properly renormalized
strongly interacting effective theories, thereby enabling experimental studies of photonic
fractional quantum Hall fluids and crystals, plus photonic quantum information processors and
repeaters.
