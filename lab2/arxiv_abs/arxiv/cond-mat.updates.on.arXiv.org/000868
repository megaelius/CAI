Alloys of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ ((Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$) have played an essential
role in the exploration of topological surface states, allowing us to study phenomena that would
otherwise be obscured by bulk contributions to conductivity. Thin films of these alloys have been
particularly important for tuning the energy of the Fermi level, a key step in observing spin-polarized
surface currents and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Previous studies reported the chemical
tuning of the Fermi level to the Dirac point by controlling the Sb:Bi composition ratio, but the optimum
ratio varies widely across various studies with no consensus. In this work, we use scanning tunneling
microscopy and Landau level spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
to isolate the effects of growth factors such as temperature and composition, and to provide a microscopic
picture of the role that disorder and composition play in determining the carrier density of epitaxially
grown (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films. Using Landau level spectroscopy, we determine that the ideal
Sb concentration to place the Fermi energy to within a few meV of the Dirac point is $x\sim 0.7$. However,
we find that the post- growth annealing temperature can have a drastic impact on microscopic structure
as well as carrier density. In particular, we find that when films are post-growth annealed at high
temperature, better crystallinity and surface roughness are achieved; but this also produces
a larger Te defect density, adding n-type carriers. This work provides key information necessary
for optimizing thin film quality in this fundamentally and technologically important class of
materials.
