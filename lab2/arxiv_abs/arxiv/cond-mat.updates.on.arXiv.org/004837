Coulomb blockade is a fundamental phenomenon in physics enabling transfer of individual electrons
one by one into electrically isolated nanostructures such as nanowires or quantum dots and thereby
creation of sources of single electrons. Nowadays, solid-state single-electron sources are key
elements of the emerging new technologies of quantum information processing and single-electron
electronics. Moreover, advanced research in free-electron quantum optics and developments in
electron microscopy require the point sources of free electrons in vacuum, which can be controlled
on a single electron level. However, up to now, single-electron vacuum guns were not realized in
practice. The problems to be solved include the formation of stable tip-shaped heterostructured
emitters and control of liberated electrons in time and energy domain. Here we overcome these challenges
by creating a field emission (FE) electron source based on a carbon nanowire coupled to an ultra-sharp
diamond tip by a tunnel junction. Using energy spectroscopy, we directly observe Coulomb oscillations
of the electron Fermi level in the nanowire at room temperature and FE currents up to 1 $\mu$A. We reveal
that the oscillations are suppressed at high FE current either by Joule heating or due to the high
tunneling resistance, depending on the nanowire charging time, ranging from about 25 fs to 1 ps.
We anticipate that the combination of introduced carbon single-electron sources with laser-induced
gating is highly promising for the creation of coherent ultrashort free-electron bunches of interest
for low-energy electron holography and ultrafast electron or X-ray imaging and spectroscopy.
