We study transport in anisotropic spin-$1/2$ chains governed by the integrable XXZ model with and
without integrability-breaking perturbations at high temperatures ($T\to \infty$) using a hybrid
approach that combines exact sum-rules with judiciously chosen Ans\"atze. In the integrable XXZ
model we find (i) super-diffusion at the isotropic (Heisenberg) point, with frequency dependent
conductivity $ \sigma'(\omega\to 0) \sim |\omega|^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha=-3/7$ in close numerical
agreement with recent $t$-DMRG computations; (ii) a continuously drifting exponent from $\alpha=-1^+$
in the XY limit of the model to $\alpha>0$ within the Ising regime; and (iii) a diffusion constant
saturating in the XY coupling deep in the Ising limit. We consider two kinds of integrability breaking
perturbations --- a simple next-nearest-neighbor spin-flip term ($J_2$) and a three-spin assisted
variant ($t_2$) natural in the fermion particle representation of the spin chain. In the first case
we discover a remarkable sensitivity of $\sigma(\omega)$ to the sign of $J_2$, with enhanced low
frequency spectral weight and a pronounced upward shift in the magnitude of $\alpha$ for $J_2>0$.
Perhaps even more surprising, we find sub-diffusion ($\alpha>0$) over a range of $J_2<0$. By contrast,
the effects of the "fermionic" three-spin perturbation are sign symmetric; this perturbation
produces a clearly observable hydrodynamic relaxation. At large strength of the integrability
breaking term $J_2\to \pm \infty$ the problem is effectively non-interacting (fermions hopping
on odd and even sublattices) and we find $\alpha\to -1$ behavior reminiscent of the XY limit of the
XXZ chain. Exact diagonalization studies largely corroborate these findings.
