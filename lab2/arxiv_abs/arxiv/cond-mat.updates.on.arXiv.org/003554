The tunability of the interlayer coupling by twisting one layer with respect to another layer of
two dimensional materials provides a unique way to manipulate the phonons and related properties.
We refer to this engineering of phononic properties as "Twistnonics". We study the effects of twisting
on low frequency shear (SM) and layer breathing (LBM) modes in transition metal dichalcogenide
(TMD) bilayer using atomistic classical simulations. We show that these low frequency modes are
extremely sensitive to twist and can be used to infer the twist angle. We find unique "ultra-soft"
phason modes (frequency $\lesssim 1\ \mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, comparable to acoustic modes) for any
non-zero twist, corresponding to an \textit{effective} translation of the moir{\'e} lattice
by relative displacement of the constituent layers in a non-trivial way. Unlike the acoustic modes,
the velocity of the phason modes are quite sensitive to twist angle. As twist angle decreases, ($\theta
\lesssim 3\degree ,\ \gtrsim 57\degree$) the ultra-soft modes represent the acoustic modes of
the "emergent" soft moir{\'e} scale lattice. Also, new high-frequency SMs appear, identical to
those in stable bilayer TMD ($\theta = 0\degree/60\degree$), due to the overwhelming growth of
stable stacking regions in relaxed twisted structures. Furthermore, we find remarkably different
structural relaxation as $\theta \to 0^{\circ}$, $\to 60^{\circ}$ due to sub-lattice symmetry
breaking. Our study reveals the possibility of an intriguing $\theta$ dependent superlubric to
pinning behavior and of the existence of ultra-soft modes in \textit{all} two-dimensional (2D)
materials.
