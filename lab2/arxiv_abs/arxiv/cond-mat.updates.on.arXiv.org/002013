Low-temperature epitaxial growth of refractory transition-metal nitride thin films by means
of physical vapor deposition has been a recurring theme in advanced thin-film technology for several
years. In the present study, 150-nm-thick epitaxial HfN layers are grown on MgO(001) by reactive
high-impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) with no external substrate heating. Maximum film
growth temperatures Ts due to plasma heating range from 70-150 {\deg}C, corresponding to Ts/Tm
= 0.10-0.12 (in which Tm is the HfN melting point in K). During HiPIMS, gas and sputtered-metal ion
fluxes incident at the growing film surface are separated in time due to strong gas rarefaction and
the transition to a metal-ion dominated plasma. In the present experiments, a negative bias of 100
V is applied to the substrate, either continuously during the entire deposition or synchronized
with the metal-rich portion of the ion flux. Two different sputtering-gas mixtures, Ar/N2 and Kr/N2,
are employed in order to probe effects associated with the noble-gas mass and ionization potential.
The combination of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution reciprocal-lattice maps, and high-resolution
cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy analyses establish that all HfN films have
a cube-on-cube orientational relationship with the substrate, i.e., [001]HfN||[001]MgO and
(100)HfN||(100)MgO. Layers grown with continuous substrate bias, in either Ar/N2 or Kr/N2, exhibit
a relatively high mosaicity and a high concentration of trapped inert gas. In distinct contrast,
layers grown in Kr/N2 with the substrate bias synchronized to the metal-ion-rich portion of HiPIMS
pulses, have much lower mosaicity, no measurable inert-gas incorporation, and a hardness of 25.7
GPa, in good agreement with results for epitaxial HfN(001) layers grown at Ts = 650 C (Ts/Tm = 0.26).
