An anapole state that breaks inversion and time reversal symmetries with preserving translation
symmetry of underlying lattice has aroused great interest as a new quantum state, but only a few candidate
materials have been reported. Recently, in a spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator \SIR, the emergence
of a possible hidden order phase with broken inversion symmetry has been suggested at $T_{\Omega}$
above the N\'{e}el temperature by optical second harmonic generation measurements. Moreover,
polarized neutron diffraction measurements revealed the broken time reversal symmetry below
$T_{\Omega}$, which was supported by subsequent muon spin relaxation experiments. However, the
nature of this mysterious phase remains largely elusive. Here, we investigate the hidden order
phase through the combined measurements of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy with exceptionally
high-precision magnetic torque and the nematic susceptibility with elastoresistance. A distinct
two-fold in-plane magnetic anisotropy along the [110] Ir-O-Ir bond direction sets in below $\sim
T_{\Omega}$, providing thermodynamic evidence for a nematic phase transition with broken $C_4$
rotational symmetry. However, in contrast to the even-parity nematic transition reported in other
correlated electron systems, the nematic susceptibility exhibits no divergent behavior towards
$T_{\Omega}$. These results provide bulk evidence for an odd-parity order parameter with broken
rotational symmetry in the hidden order state. We discuss the hidden order in terms of an anapole
state, in which polar toroidal moment is induced by two current loops in each IrO$_6$ octahedron
of opposite chirality. Contrary to the simplest loop-current pattern previously suggested, the
present results are consistent with a pattern in which the intra-unit cell loop-current flows along
only one of the diagonal directions in the IrO$_4$ square.
