We study perturbative and global anomalies at the boundaries of bosonic analogues of integer quantum
Hall (BIQH) and topological insulator (BTI) phases using a description of the boundaries of these
phases in terms of a nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) with Wess-Zumino term. One of the main results of
the paper is that these anomalies are robust against arbitrary smooth deformations of the target
space of the NLSM which describes the phase, provided that the deformations also respect the symmetry
of the phase. In the first part of the paper we discuss the perturbative $U(1)$ anomaly at the boundary
of BIQH states in all odd (spacetime) dimensions. In the second part we study global anomalies at
the boundary of BTI states in even dimensions. In a previous work [Phys. Rev. B 95, 035149 (2017)]
we argued that the boundary of the BTI phase exhibits a global anomaly which is an analogue of the parity
anomaly of Dirac fermions in three dimensions. Here we elevate this argument to a proof for the boundary
of the two-dimensional BTI state by explicitly computing the partition function of the gauged NLSM
describing the boundary. We then use the powerful equivariant localization technique to show that
this global anomaly is robust against all smooth deformations of the target space of the NLSM which
preserve the $U(1)\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the BTI state. We also comment on the difficulties
of generalizing this latter proof to higher dimensions. Finally, we discuss the expected low energy
behavior of the boundary theories studied in this paper when the coupling constants are allowed
to flow under the renormalization group.
