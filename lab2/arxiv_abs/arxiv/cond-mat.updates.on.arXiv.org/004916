Bayesian networks are powerful statistical models to understand causal relationships in real-world
probabilistic problems such as diagnosis, forecasting, computer vision, etc. For systems that
involve complex causal dependencies among many variables, the complexity of the associated Bayesian
networks become computationally intractable. As a result, direct hardware implementation of
these networks is one promising approach to reducing power consumption and execution time. However,
the few hardware implementations of Bayesian networks presented in literature rely on deterministic
CMOS devices that are not efficient in representing the inherently stochastic variables in a Bayesian
network. This work presents an experimental demonstration of a Bayesian network building block
implemented with naturally stochastic spintronic devices. These devices are based on nanomagnets
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, initialized to their hard axes by the spin orbit torque
from a heavy metal under-layer utilizing the giant spin Hall effect, enabling stochastic behavior.
We construct an electrically interconnected network of two stochastic devices and manipulate
the correlations between their states by changing connection weights and biases. By mapping given
conditional probability tables to the circuit hardware, we demonstrate that any two node Bayesian
networks can be implemented by our stochastic network. We then present the stochastic simulation
of an example case of a four node Bayesian network using our proposed device, with parameters taken
from the experiment. We view this work as a first step towards the large scale hardware implementation
of Bayesian networks.
