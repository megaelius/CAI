Incommensurate (IC) charge-order (CO) and spin density wave (SDW) order in electron doped SrMn1-xWxO3-{\delta}
(x= 0.08 to 0.1875) have been studied using neutron diffraction.The study highlights the drastic
effect of electron doping on the emergence of magnetic ground states which were not revealed in manganites
before. With increasing (x) the crystal structure changes from simple tetragonal (P4/mmm) to an
IC-CO modulated structure with super space-group P2/m({\alpha}\b{eta}0)00 having ab-planer
ferro order of 3dx2-y2 orbitals in a compressed tetragonal (c<a) lattice. The IC-CO order is found
to be intimately related with the 3dx2-y2 orbital order.The occurrence of IC-CO has been attributed
to the mixed character (itinerant/localized) of eg-electrons undergoing Fermi-surface nesting
of 3dx2-y2 band causing electronic instability, which opens a gap through a charge density wave
(CDW) mechanism. This feature appears to share proximity with the high-Tc cuprates. At lower temperatures,
the CDW phase undergoes SDW transition, which changes continuously with x and finally disappear
at higher x due to the introduction of large frustration into the system. For 0.08 < x < 0.10 a C-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order with propagation vector k = (1/2, 1/2, 0) appears under ferro-ordering
of 3dz2 orbitals, whereas for x > 0.1, a different C-type AFM order with propagation vector k = (1/2,0,1/2),
coexists with an incommensurate SDW order with k = (0.12, 0.38, 1/2).For compositions with 0.1625
< x < 0.175, while the structural features of CDW and orbital-order remain qualitatively the same,
the magnetic interaction gets modified and results another SDW phase with single incommensurate
propagation vector k = (0.07, 0.43, 1/2). A detail magnetic and structural phase-diagram, as a function
of W substitution for SrMn1-xWxO3 (0.08 < x < 0.4) is presented.
