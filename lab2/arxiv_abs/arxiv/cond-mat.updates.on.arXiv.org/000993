Granular materials such as sand, powders, foams etc. are ubiquitous in our daily life, as well as
in industrial and geotechnical applications. Although these disordered systems form stable structures
if unperturbed, in practice they do relax because of the presence of unavoidable external influences
such as tapping or shear. Often it is tacitly assumed that for granular systems this relaxation dynamics
is similar to the one of thermal glass-formers, but in fact experimental difficulties have so far
prevented to determine the dynamic properties of three dimensional granular systems on the particle
level. This lack of experimental data, combined with the fact that in these systems the motion of
the particles involves friction, makes it very challenging to come up with an accurate description
of their relaxation dynamics. Here we use X-ray tomography to determine the microscopic relaxation
dynamics of hard granular ellipsoids that are subject to an oscillatory shear. We find that the distribution
function of the particle displacement can be described by a Gumbel law with a shape parameter that
is independent of time and the strain amplitude $\gamma$. Despite this universality, the mean squared
displacement of a tagged particle shows power-laws as a function of time with an exponent that depends
on $\gamma$ and the time interval considered. We argue that these results are directly related to
the existence of the microscopic relaxation mechanisms that involve friction and memory effects.
These observations demonstrate that on the particle level the dynamical behavior of granular systems
is qualitatively different from the one of thermal glass-formers and instead more similar to the
one of complex fluids. Thus we conclude that granular materials can relax even when the driving is
weak, an insight which impacts our understanding of the nature of granular solids.
