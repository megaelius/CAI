The spinel vanadates have become a model family for exploring orbital order on the frustrated pyrochlore
lattice, and recent debate has focused on the symmetry of local crystal fields at the cation sites.
Here, we present neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum in $\mathrm{FeV_2O_4}$,
a recent example of a ferrimagnetic spinel vanadate which is available in single crystal form. We
report the existence of two emergent magnon modes at low temperatures, which draw strong parallels
with the closely related material, $\mathrm{MnV_2O_4}$. We were able to reproduce the essential
elements of both the magnetic ordering pattern and the dispersion of the inelastic modes with semi-
classical spin wave calculations, using a minimal model that implies a sizeable single-ion anisotropy
on the vanadium sublattice. Taking into account the direction of ordered spins, we associate this
anisotropy with the large trigonal distortion of $\mathrm{VO_6}$ octahedra, previously observed
via neutron powder diffraction measurements. We further report on the spin gap, which is an order-of-magnitude
larger than that observed in $\mathrm{MnV_2O_4}$. By looking at the overall temperature dependence,
we were able to show that the gap magnitude is largely associated with the ferro-orbital order known
to exist on the iron sublattice, but the contribution to the gap from the vanadium sublattice is in
fact comparable to what is reported in the Mn compound. This reinforces the conclusion that the spin
canting transition is associated with the ordering of vanadium orbitals in this system, and closer
analysis indicates closely related physics underlying orbital transitions in $\mathrm{FeV_2O_4}$
and $\mathrm{MnV_2O_4}$.
