Identifying the point defects in 2D materials is important for many applications. Recent studies
have proposed that W vacancies are the predominant point defect in 2D WSe2, in contrast to theoretical
studies, which predict that chalcogen vacancies are the most likely intrinsic point defects in
transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors. We show using first principles calculations,
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments,
that W vacancies are not present in our CVD-grown 2D WSe2. We predict that O-passivated Se vacancies
(O_Se) and O interstitials (Oins) are present in 2D WSe2, because of facile O2 dissociation at Se
vacancies, or due to the presence of WO3 precursors in CVD growth. These defects give STM images in
good agreement with experiment. The optical properties of point defects in 2D WSe2 are important
because single photon emission (SPE) from 2D WSe2 has been observed experimentally. While strain
gradients funnel the exciton in real space, point defects are necessary for the localization of
the exciton at length scales that enable photons to be emitted one at a time. Using state-of-the-art
GW-Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations, we predict that only Oins defects give localized excitons
within the energy range of SPE in previous experiments, making them a likely source of previously
observed SPE. No other point defects (O_Se, Se vacancies, W vacancies and Se_W antisites) give localized
excitons in the same energy range. Our predictions suggest ways to realize SPE in related 2D materials
and point experimentalists toward other energy ranges for SPE in 2D WSe2.
