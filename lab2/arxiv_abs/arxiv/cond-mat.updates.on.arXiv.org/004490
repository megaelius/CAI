This review treats asymmetric colloidal particles moving through their host fluid under the action
of some form of propulsion. The propulsion can come from an external body force or from external shear
flow. It may also come from externally-induced stresses at the surface, arising from imposed chemical,
thermal or electrical gradients. The resulting motion arises jointly from the driven particle
and the displaced fluid. If the objects are asymmetric, every aspect of their motion and interaction
depends on the orientation of the objects. This orientation in turn changes in response to the driving.
The objects' shape can thus lead to a range of emergent anisotropic and chiral motion not possible
with isotropic spherical particles. We first consider what aspects of a body's asymmetry can affect
its drift through a fluid, especially chiral motion. We next discuss driving by injecting external
force or torque into the particles. Then we consider driving without injecting force or torque.
This includes driving by shear flow and driving by surface stresses, such as electrophoresis. We
consider how time-dependent driving can induce collective orientational order and coherent motion.
We show how a given particle shape can be represented using an assembly of point forces called a Stokeslet
object. We next consider the interactions between anisotropic propelled particles, the symmetries
governing the interactions, and the possibility of bound pairs of particles. Finally we show how
the collective hydrodynamics of a suspension can be qualitatively altered by the particles' shapes.
The asymmetric responses discussed here are broadly relevant also for swimming propulsion of active
micron-scale objects such as microorganisms.
