Emergent lattices at mesoscopic length scales have evoked interest in several recent contexts,
e.g., in crystalline arrangements of skyrmions. It is a challenging task to determine their collective
excitations as the unit cells are large and can contain complex textures. We address this issue in
the oldest known example of an emergent mesoscopic lattice, the vortex lattice in superfluids or
(conventional) type-II superconductors. We show that a tight binding approach can successfully
describe collective modes. We start with a single isolated vortex where the low-lying excitations
are localized pairing fluctuations. They can be understood as wave-like disturbances that propagate
in the azimuthal direction around the vortex centre. In particular, the lowest energy excitations
are gyrotropic and breathing modes. The former corresponds to circular motion of the eye of the vortex,
while the latter represents an oscillation between sharper and broader vortex profiles. These
modes are `bosonic' analogues of atomic orbitals with the vortex profile playing the role of the
nuclear potential. Moving to a sparse vortex lattice with well separated vortices, the single-vortex
excitations provide a convenient basis for finding normal modes. We derive an analogue of Bloch's
theorem in this context, revealing a non-trivial phase contribution arising from the orbital field.
We set up a tight binding prescription and use it to explicitly determine the band structure of excitations
about a square vortex lattice. Our results can be tested in materials such as V$_3$Si as well as in
cold atom experiments with synthetic magnetic fields.
