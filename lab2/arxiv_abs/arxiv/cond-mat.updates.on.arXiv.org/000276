We present the expression for the quasiparticle vertex function $\Gamma^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$
(proportional to the Landau function) in a 2D Fermi liquid (FL) near a $T=0$ instability towards
antiferromagnetism. Previous studies have found that near an instability, the system enters into
a critical FL regime, in which the fermionic self-energy is large near hot spots (points on the Fermi
surface connected by the antiferromagnetic ordering vector $q_\pi=(\pi,\pi)$) and has much stronger
dependence on frequency than on momentum. We show that to properly calculate the vertex function
in this regime one has to sum up an infinite series of terms which were explicitly excluded in the conventional
treatment. Besides, we show that, to properly describe the spin component of $\Gamma^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$
even in an ordinary FL, one has to include Aslamazov-Larkin terms. We show that the total $\Gamma^{\omega
}(K_{F},P_{F})$ is larger in a critical FL than in an ordinary FL, roughly by an extra power of magnetic
correlation length $\xi$. However, the enhancement of $\Gamma ^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$ is highly
non-uniform: It holds only when, for one of the two momentum variables, the distance from a hot spot
along the Fermi surface is much larger than for the other one. We show that the charge and spin components
of the total vertex function satisfy the universal relations following from the Ward identities
related to the conservation of the particle number and the total spin. We find that the charge and
spin components of $\Gamma^{\omega }(K_{F},P_{F})$ are identical to leading order in the magnetic
correlation length. We derive the Landau parameters, the density of states $N_F$, and the uniform
($q=0$) charge and spin susceptibilities $\chi ^{l=0}_{c} = \chi^{l=0}_s$. We show that the susceptibilities
remain finite at $\xi = \infty$ despite that $N_F$ diverges as $\log \xi$.
