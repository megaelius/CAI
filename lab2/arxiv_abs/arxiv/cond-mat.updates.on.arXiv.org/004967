Despite previous extensive analysis of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad equation,
it is unclear whether correlated topological states, such as fractional quantum Hall states, are
maintained even in the presence of the jump term. In this paper, we introduce the pseudo-spin Chern
number of the Liouvillian which is computed by twisting the boundary conditions only for one of the
subspaces of the doubled Hilbert space. The existence of such a topological invariant elucidates
that the topological properties remain unchanged even in the presence of the jump term which does
not close the gap of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (obtained by neglecting the jump term).
In other words, the topological properties are encoded into an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
rather than the full Liouvillian. This is particularly useful when the jump term can be written as
a strictly block-upper (-lower) triangular matrix in the doubled Hilbert space, in which case the
presence or absence of the jump term does not affect the spectrum of the Liouvillian. With the pseudo-spin
Chern number, we address the characterization of fractional quantum Hall states with two-body
loss but without gain, elucidating that the topology of the non-Hermitian fractional quantum Hall
states is preserved even in the presence of the jump term. This numerical result also supports the
use of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which significantly reduces the numerical cost. Similar
topological invariants can be extended to treat correlated topological states for other spatial
dimensions and symmetry (e.g., one-dimensional open quantum systems with inversion symmetry),
indicating the high versatility of our approach.
