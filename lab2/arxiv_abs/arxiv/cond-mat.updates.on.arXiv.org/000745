Collective migration dominates many phenomena, from cell movement in living systems to abiotic
self-propelling particles. Focusing on the early stages of tumor evolution, we enunciate the principles
involved in cell dynamics and highlight their implications in understanding similar behavior
in seemingly unrelated soft glassy materials and possibly chemokine-induced migration of CD8$^{+}$
T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal three dimensional model, accounting
for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell interactions to establish that cell growth rate-dependent
tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological niches. Cells at the periphery
move with higher velocity perpendicular to the tumor boundary, while motion of interior cells is
slower and isotropic. The mean square displacement, $\Delta(t)$, of cells exhibits glassy behavior
at times comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting super-diffusive behavior, $\Delta
(t) \approx t^{\alpha}$, at longer times. We derive the value of $\alpha \approx \frac{4}{3}$ using
a field theoretic approach based on stochastic quantization. In the process we establish the universality
of super-diffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated non-equilibrium systems. Our findings for
the collective migration, which also suggests that tumor evolution occurs in a polarized manner,
are in quantitative agreement with {\it in vitro} experiments. Although set in the context of tumor
invasion the findings should also hold in describing collective motion in growing cells and in active
systems where creation and annihilation of particles play a role.
