In the spectral density of Cr(001) surfaces a sharp resonance close to the Fermi level is observed
in both experiment and theory. For the physical origin of this peak two mechanisms were proposed.
A single particle dz2 surface state renormalised by electron-phonon coupling and an orbital Kondo
effect due to the degenerate dxz/dyz states. Despite several experimental and theoretical investigations,
the origin is still under debate. In this work we address this problem by two different approaches
of the dynamical mean-field theory. First, by the spin-polarized T-matrix fluctuation exchange
approximation suitable for weakly and moderately correlated systems. Second, by the non-crossing
approximation derived in the limit of weak hybridization (i.e. for strongly correlated systems)
capturing Kondo-like processes. By using recent continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations
as a benchmark, we find that the high-energy features, everything except the resonance, of the spectrum
is captured within the spin-polarized T-matrix fluctuation exchange approximation. More precisely
the particle-particle processes provide the main contribution. For the non-crossing approximation
it appears that spin-polarized calculations suffer from spurious behavior at the Fermi level.
Then, we turned to non spin-polarized calculations to avoid this unphysical behavior. By employing
two plausible starting hybridization functions, it is observed that the characteristics of the
resonance are crucially dependent on the starting point. It appears that only one of these starting
hybridizations could result in an orbital Kondo resonance in the presence of a strong magnetic field
like in the Cr(001) surface. It is for a future investigation to first resolve the unphysical behavior
within the spin-polarized non-crossing approximation and then check for an orbital Kondo resonance.
