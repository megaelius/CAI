The dissipative curve-crossing problem provides a paradigm for electron-transfer (ET) processes
in condensed media. It establishes the simplest conceptual test bed to study the influence of the
medium's dynamics on ET kinetics both on the ensemble level, and on the level of single particles.
Single electron description is particularly important for nanoscale systems. Slow medium's dynamics
is capable to enslave ET and bring it on the ensemble level from a quantum regime of non-adiabatic
tunneling to the classical adiabatic regime, where electrons just follow to the nuclei rearrangements.
This classical adiabatic textbook picture contradicts, however, in a very spectacular fashion
to the statistics of single electron transitions, even in the Debye, memoryless media, named also
Ohmic in the parlance of the famed spin-boson model. On the single particle level, ET remains always
quantum and this was named a quantum breaking of ergodicity in the adiabatic ET regime. What happens
in the case of subdiffusive, fractional, or sub-Ohmic medium's dynamics, which is featured by power-law
decaying dynamical memory effects typical e.g. for protein macromolecules, and other viscoelastic
media? Such a memory is vividly manifested by anomalous Cole-Cole dielectric response typical
for such media. This is the question which is addressed in this work based both on precise numerics
and an analytical semi-classical theory. The ensemble theory remarkably agrees with the numerical
dynamics of electronic populations, revealing a power law relaxation tail even in a deeply non-adiabatic
electron transfer regime. However, a profound difference with the numerically accurate results
occurs for the distribution of residence times in the electronic states, both on the ensemble level
and on the level of single trajectories. Ergodicity is broken dynamically even in a more spectacular
way than in the memoryless case.
