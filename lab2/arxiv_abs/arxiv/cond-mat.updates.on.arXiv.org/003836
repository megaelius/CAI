Robust topologically trivial low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) induced by position-dependent
effective potentials have recently come under renewed focus, in light of a remarkable set of experiments
observing robust quantized zero-bias conductance plateaus in semiconductor-superconductor
heterostructures. We show that (1) the partial spatial separation of the wave functions of the component
Majorana bound states (MBSs) is crucial for the creation and stability of topologically trivial
near-zero-energy Andreev bound states, (2) the signs of the spin polarizations of the component
MBSs can be either the same or opposite, depending on the profile of the inducing potential, and (3)
the spin polarizations do not play a fundamental role in generating vastly different coupling strengths
to local probes and/or ensuring the robustness of the near-zero-energy ABS. Consequently, in contrast
to recent theoretical claims (Vuik et al., arXiv:1806.02801), we find that a robust, quantized
zero-bias conductance plateau of height 2e^2/h measured in the topologically trivial regime necessarily
requires partially separated ABSs (ps-ABSs), independent of the relative signs of the spin-polarizations.
In addition, we show that (4) well-defined energy splitting oscillations involve MBSs characterized
by exponential tails pointing toward each other, and (5) ps-ABSs generated by the tunnel barrier
itself produce zero-bias conductance peaks with a characteristic width that increases strongly
with the applied magnetic field. Finally, we propose (6) a quantitative scheme for analyzing the
stability of Majorana modes based on probability distributions of splitting susceptibilities
and show that a ps-ABS mode can be remarkably robust when judged based on its signature in a charge
tunneling experiment, but, in essence, is topologically unprotected.
