Ice-templating produces materials with aligned, elongated pores via directional solidification
of particle suspensions, sublimation of the solidified fluid, and sintering of the particle walls.
Most ice-templating studies utilize upward solidification techniques, where solid ice is located
at the bottom of the solidification mold, the liquid suspension is on top of the ice, and the solidification
front advances upward, against gravity. Liquid water reaches its maximum density at 4{\deg}C;
thus, liquid nearest the cold source is less dense than warmer liquid above. The lower density liquid
nearest the cold source is expected to rise due to buoyancy, promoting convective fluid motion during
solidification. Here, we investigate the effect of solidification direction with respect to the
direction of gravity on ice-templated microstructures to study the role of buoyancy-driven fluid
motion during solidification. We hypothesize that, for upward solidification, the convective
fluid motion that results from a liquid density gradient occurs near the solidification front.
For downward solidification, we expect that this fluid motion occurs farther away from the solidification
front. Aqueous suspensions of TiO2 nanoparticles are solidified upward (against gravity, with
ice on bottom and water on top), downward (water on bottom, ice on top), and horizontally (perpendicular
to gravity). Microstructural investigation of sintered samples shows evidence of buoyancy-driven,
convective fluid flow during solidification for samples solidified upwards (against gravity),
including tilting of the wall (and pore) orientation with respect to the induced temperature gradient,
ice lens defects, and radial macrosegregation. These features are not observed for downward nor
horizontal solidification configurations.
