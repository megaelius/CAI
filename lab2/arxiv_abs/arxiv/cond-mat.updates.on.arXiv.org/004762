Magnetism typically arises from a conspiracy between Fermi statistics and repulsive Coulomb interactions
that favors ground states with non-zero electron spin. As a result, controlling spin magnetism
with electric fields---a longstanding technological goal---can be achieved only indirectly
using spin orbit coupling. Here, we experimentally demonstrate direct electric field control
of magnetic states in an orbital Chern insulator, a magnetic system in which non-trivial band topology
favors long range order of orbital angular momentum but the spins remained disordered. We use van
der Waals heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer rotationally faulted with respect
to a Bernal-stacked bilayer to realize narrow and topologically nontrivial valley-projected
moir\'e minibands. At fillings $\nu=1$ and $3$ electrons per moir\'e unit cell within these bands,
we observe quantized anomalous Hall effects with $R_{xy}\approx h/2e^2$, indicative of spontaneous
polarization of the system into a single valley-projected band with Chern number $C=2$. At $\nu=3$
we find that the sign of the quantum anomalous Hall effect can be reversed via field-effect control
of the chemical potential; moreover, this transition is hysteretic, which we use to demonstrate
nonvolatile electric field induced reversal of the magnetic state. A theoretical analysis indicates
that the effect arises from the topological edge states, which drive a change in sign of the magnetization
and thus a reversal in the favored magnetic state. Voltage control of magnetic states can be used
to electrically pattern nonvolatile magnetic domain structures hosting chiral edge states, with
applications ranging from reconfigurable microwave circuit elements to ultra-low power magnetic
memory.
