The dynamics of a flexible filament sedimenting in a viscous fluid are explored analytically and
numerically. Compared to the well-studied case of sedimenting rigid rods, the introduction of
filament compliance is shown to cause a significant alteration in the long-time sedimentation
orientation and filament geometry. A model is developed by balancing viscous, elastic, and gravitational
forces in a slender-body theory for zero-Reynolds-number flows, and the filament dynamics are
characterized by a dimensionless elasto-gravitation number. Filaments of both non-uniform and
uniform cross-sectional thickness are considered. In the weakly flexible regime, a multiple-scale
asymptotic expansion is used to obtain expressions for filament translations, rotations, and
shapes. These are shown to match excellently with full numerical simulations. Furthermore, we
show that trajectories of sedimenting flexible filaments, unlike their rigid counterparts, are
restricted to a cloud whose envelope is determined by the elasto-gravitation number. In the highly
flexible regime we show that a filament sedimenting along its long axis is susceptible to a buckling
instability. A linear stability analysis provides a dispersion relation, illustrating clearly
the competing effects of the compressive stress and the restoring elastic force in the buckling
process. The instability travels as a wave along the filament opposite the direction of gravity
as it grows and the predicted growth rates are shown to compare favorably with numerical simulations.
The linear eigenmodes of the governing equation are also studied, which agree well with the finite-amplitude
buckled shapes arising in simulations.
