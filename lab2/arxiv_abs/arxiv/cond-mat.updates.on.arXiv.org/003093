In this work, we report the combined effect of donor (Nd) and acceptor (Li) co-doping at the Zn-site
of ZnO ceramics on structural, microstructural and dielectric properties. Combining experimental
observations with DFT based theoretical study, we have shown that before experimental fabrication
DFT based first principles study can be used as a good indication to have prior qualitative assessment
of a dielectric medium. For implementing this objective various Li and Nd co-doped ZnO ceramics
have been synthesized through the conventional solid-state reaction route. Quantitative XRD
analysis reveals the formation of wurtzite hexagonal structured ZnO having space group P63mc.
Meanwhile, FESEM micrographs confirm the formation of randomly aligned non-uniform grains in
size and shape. We show that the average grain size distribution and density of the studied compositions
are two tuning factors to control the dielectric properties of these compounds. Though the value
of dielectric constant is decreased with the increase in doping content, the optimum composition
Nd0.005Li0.005Zn0.99O exhibits slightly lower dielectric constant (2066 at 1 KHz) than pristine
ZnO but relatively very low dielectric loss (0.20 at 1 KHz) at room temperature than pure ZnO ceramics
sintered at 1623 K. For understanding the dielectric relaxation mechanism in the studied ceramics,
complex impedance spectra analysis have also been performed and discussed thoroughly. This study
provides a new insight for further development of colossal permittivity (CP) ceramics and extends
the current understanding of CP mechanism in ceramic materials.
