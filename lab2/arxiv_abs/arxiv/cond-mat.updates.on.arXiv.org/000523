Transitions to chaos in archetypal low-dimensional nonlinear maps offer real and precise model
systems in which to assess proposed generalizations of statistical mechanics. The known association
of chaotic dynamics with the structure of Boltzmann--Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics has suggested
the potential verification of these generalizations at the onset of chaos, when the only Lyapunov
exponent vanishes and ergodic and mixing properties cease to hold. There are three well-known routes
to chaos in these deterministic dissipative systems, period-doubling, quasi-periodicity and
intermittency, which provide the setting in which to explore the limit of validity of the standard
BG structure. It has been shown that there is a rich and intricate behavior for both the dynamics within
and towards the attractors at the onset of chaos and that these two kinds of properties are linked
via generalized statistical-mechanical expressions. Amongst the topics presented are: (i) permanently
growing sensitivity fluctuations and their infinite family of generalized Pesin identities;
(ii) the emergence of statistical-mechanical structures in the dynamics along the routes to chaos;
(iii) dynamical hierarchies with modular organization; and (iv) limit distributions of sums of
deterministic variables. The occurrence of generalized entropy properties in condensed-matter
physical systems is illustrated by considering critical fluctuations, localization transition
and glass formation. We complete our presentation with the description of the manifestations of
the dynamics at the transitions to chaos in various kinds of complex systems, such as, frequency
and size rank distributions and complex network images of time series. We discuss the results.
