Bismuth iron garnet (BIG), i.e. Bi3Fe5O12, is a strong ferrimagnet that also possess outstanding
magneto-optical properties such as the largest known Faraday rotation. These properties are related
with the distribution of magnetic moments on octahedral and tetrahedral sites, the presence of
spin gaps in the density of state and a strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, first-principles
ab initio calculations are performed to study the structural, electronic and magnetic properties
of BIG using Density Functional Theory with Hubbard+U (DFT+U) correction including spin-orbit
coupling and HSE06 hybrid functional. We found that the presence of spin gaps in the electronic structure
results from the interplay between exchange and correlation effects and the crystal field strengths
for tetrahedral and octahedral iron sublattices. The DFT+U treatment tends to close the spin-gaps
for larger U due to over-localization effects, notably in the octahedral site. On the other hand,
the hybrid functional confirms the occurrences of three spin gaps in the iron states of the conduction
band as expected from optical measurements. A strong exchange splitting at the top of the valence
bands associated with a lone-pair type mixture of O p and Bi s,p states is also obtained. Similar exchange
splitting was not previously observed for other iron based garnets, such as for yttrium iron garnet.
It follows that hole doping, as obtained by Ca substitution at Bi sites, results in a full spin polarized
density at the Fermi energy. This work helps to shed more light on the theoretical comprehension
of the properties of BIG and opens the route towards the use of advanced Many Body calculations to
predict the magneto-optical coupling effects in BIG in a direct comparison with the experimental
measurements.
