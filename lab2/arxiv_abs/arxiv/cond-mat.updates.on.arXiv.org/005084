Motivated by problems arising in the pneumatic actuation of controllers (for MEMS, labs-on-a-chip
or biomimetic soft robots) and the study of microrheology of both gases and soft solids, we analyze
the transient fluid--structure interactions (FSIs) in a viscoelastic tube conveying compressible
flow at low Reynolds number. We express the density of the fluid as a linear function of the pressure,
and we use the lubrication approximation to further simplify the fluid dynamics problem. On the
other hand, the structural mechanics is governed by a modified Donnell shell theory accounting
for Kelvin--Voigt-type linear viscoelastic mechanical response. The fluid and structural mechanics
problems are coupled through the tube's radial deformation and the hydrodynamic pressure. For
small compressibility numbers and weak coupling, the equations are solved analytically via a perturbation
expansion. Three illustrative problems are analyzed. First, we obtain exact implicit solutions
for the pressure under steady conditions, taking into account flow rarefaction. Second , we solve
the transient problem of impulsive pressurization of the tube's inlet. Third, we analyze the transient
response to an oscillatory inlet pressure. We show that an oscillatory inlet pressure leads to acoustic
streaming in the tube, attributed to the nonlinear pressure gradient induced by the interplay of
FSI and compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate an enhancement in the volumetric flow rate
due to the coupling. The hydrodynamics pressure oscillations are shown to exhibit a low-pass frequency
response (when averaging over the period of oscillations), while the frequency response of the
tube itself is similar to that of a band-pass filter.
