We introduce a coupled wire model for a sequence of non-Abelian quantum Hall states that generalize
the Z4 parafermion Read Rezayi state. The Z4 orbifold quantum Hall states occur at filling factors
\nu = 2/(2m-p) for odd integers $m$ and $p$, and have a topological order with a neutral sector characterized
by the orbifold conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$ at radius $R=\sqrt{p/2}$. When
$p=1$ the state is Abelian. The state with $p=3$ is the $Z_4$ Read Rezayi state, and the series of $p\ge
3$ defines a sequence of non-Abelian states that resembles the Laughlin sequence. Our model is based
on clustering of electrons in groups of four, and is formulated as a two fluid model in which each wire
exhibits two phases: a weak clustered phase, where charge $e$ electrons coexist with charge $4e$
bosons and a strong clustered phase where the electrons are strongly bound in groups of 4. The transition
between these two phases on a wire is mapped to the critical point of the 4 state clock model, which
in turn is described by the orbifold conformal field theory. For an array of wires coupled in the presence
of a perpendicular magnetic field, strongly clustered wires form a charge $4e$ bosonic Laughlin
state with a chiral charge mode at the edge, but no neutral mode and a gap for single electrons. Coupled
wires near the critical state form quantum Hall states with a gapless neutral mode described by the
orbifold theory. The coupled wire approach allows us to employ the Abelian bosonization technique
to fully analyze the physics of single wire, and then to extract most topological properties of the
resulting non-Abelian quantum Hall states. These include the list of quasiparticles, their fusion
rules, the correspondence between bulk quasiparticles and edge topological sectors, and most
of the phases associated with quasiparticles winding one another.
