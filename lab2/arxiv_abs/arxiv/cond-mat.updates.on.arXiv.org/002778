The spin Nernst effect describes a transverse spin current induced by the longitudinal thermal
gradient in a system with the spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the spin Nernst effect in a mesoscopic
four-terminal cross-bar Weyl semimetal device under a perpendicular magnetic field. By using
the tight-binding Hamiltonian combining with the nonequilibrium Green's function method, the
three elements of the spin current in the transverse leads and then spin Nernst coefficients are
obtained. The results show that the spin Nernst effect in the Weyl semimetal has the essential difference
with the traditional one: The z direction spin currents is zero without the magnetic field while
it appears under the magnetic field, and the x and y direction spin currents in the two transverse
leads flows out or flows in together, in contrary to the traditional spin Nernst effect, in which
the spin current is induced by the spin-orbit coupling and flows out from one lead and flows in on the
other. So we call it the anomalous spin Nernst effect. In addition, we show that the Weyl semimetals
have the center-reversal-type symmetry, the mirror-reversal-type symmetry and the electron-hole-type
symmetry, which lead to the spin Nernst coefficients being odd function or even function of the Fermi
energy, the magnetic field and the transverse terminals. Moreover, the spin Nernst effect in the
Weyl semimetals are strongly anisotropic and its coefficients are strongly dependent on both the
direction of thermal gradient and the direction of the transverse lead connection. Three non-equivalent
connection modes (x-z, z-x and x-y modes) are studied in detail, and the spin Nernst coefficients
for three different modes exhibit very different behaviors. These strongly anisotropic behaviors
of the spin Nernst effect can be used as the characterization of magnetic Weyl semimetals.
