Understanding, optimizing, and controlling the optical absorption process, exciton gemination,
and electron-hole separation and conduction in low dimensional systems is a fundamental problem
in materials science. However, robust and efficient methods capable of modelling the optical absorbance
of low dimensional macromolecular systems and providing physical insight into the processes involved
have remained elusive. We employ a highly efficient linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAOs)
representation of the Kohn--Sham (KS) orbitals within time dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) in the reciprocal space ($k$) and frequency ($\omega$) domains, as implemented within
our LCAO-TDDFT-$k$-$\omega$ code, and apply the derivative discontinuity correction of the exchange
functional $\Delta_x$ to the KS eigenenergies. In so doing we are able to provide a semi-quantitative
description of the optical absorption, conductivity, and polarizability spectra for prototypical
0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D systems within the optical limit ($\|\bf{q}\|\to0^+$) as compared to both available
measurements and from solving the Bethe$-$Salpeter equation with quasiparticle $G_0 W_0$ eigenvalues
($G_0 W_0$-BSE). Specifically, we consider 0D fullerene (C$_{60}$), 1D metallic (10,0) and semiconducting
(10,10) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), 2D graphene (GR) and phosphorene (PN), and 3D
rutile (R-TiO$_2$) and anatase (A-TiO$_2$). For each system, we also employ the spatially resolved
electron-hole density to provide direct physical insight into the nature of their optical excitations.
These results demonstrate the reliability, applicability, efficiency, and robustness of our
LCAO-TDDFT-$k$-$\omega$ code, and open the pathway to the computational design of macromolecular
systems for optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and photocatalytic applications $in$ $silico$.
