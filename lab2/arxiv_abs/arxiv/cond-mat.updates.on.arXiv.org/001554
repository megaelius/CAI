We study effects of disorder (randomness) in a 2D square-lattice $S=1/2$ quantum spin system, the
$J$-$Q$ model with a 6-spin interaction $Q$ supplementing the Heisenberg exchange $J$. In the absence
of disorder the system hosts antiferromagnetic (AFM) and columnar valence-bond-solid (VBS) ground
states. The VBS breaks $Z_4$ symmetry, and in the presence of arbitrarily weak disorder it forms
domains. Using QMC simulations, we demonstrate two kinds of such disordered VBS states. Upon dilution,
a removed site leaves a localized spin in the opposite sublattice. These spins form AFM order. For
random interactions, we find a different state, with no order but algebraically decaying mean correlations.
We identify localized spinons at the nexus of domain walls between different VBS patterns. These
spinons form correlated groups with the same number of spinons and antispinons. Within such a group,
there is a strong tendency to singlet formation, because of spinon-spinon interactions mediated
by the domain walls. Thus, no long-range AFM order forms. We propose that this state is a 2D analog
of the well-known 1D random singlet (RS) state, though the dynamic exponent $z$ in 2D is finite. By
studying the T-dependent magnetic susceptibility, we find that $z$ varies, from $z=2$ at the AFM--RS
phase boundary and larger in the RS phase The RS state discovered here in a system without geometric
frustration should correspond to the same fixed point as the RS state recently proposed for frustrated
systems, and the ability to study it without Monte Carlo sign problems opens up opportunities for
further detailed characterization of its static and dynamic properties. We discuss possible experimental
observations of this phase in triangular- and square-lattice quantum magnets.
