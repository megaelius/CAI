We propose a time reversal invariant Composite Fermion Insulator(CFI) state with neutral Fermi
surface and $U(1)$ gauge field. We consider a system consisting of two quantum Hall layers with opposite
magnetic fields (or two nearly flat bands with opposite Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$) at filling $\nu_T=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}$.
We add inter-layer repulsive interaction starting from two decoupled Composite Fermion Liquids
(CFL) with opposite chiralities. In this case physical exciton is frustrated from condensation,
unlike the conventional quantum Hall bilayers. We argue that more natural phases are the exciton
condensates between composite fermions or between slave bosons. The resulting states are insulators
with neutral Fermi surfaces coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field without Chern-Simons term.
We consider this CFI phase for the following two motivations. (1) In this state, the internal magnetic
field $\mathbf{B_a}$ is perfectly locked to an external magnetic field $B$: $\mathbf{B_a}=\mathbf{B}$.
As a result, this phase can show quantum oscillations satisfying the Onsager condition. (2) The
proposed CFI state is one example of a family of states which are generalization of the well-studied
Composite Fermion Liquid (CFL) state. The CFL can be constructed as a neutral Fermi surface coupled
to an $U(1)$ gauge field $a$, which further couples to a special bosonic topological order state:
$U(1)_2$ or $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$ Laughlin state. The CFI state in this paper can be viewed as replacing
the $U(1)_2$ bosonic sector with another time reversal invariant bosonic topological order: double
semion state. Finally we also comment on other possible states in this kind of system with $C=\pm
1$ flat bands. One interesting possibility is a topological superconductor in the $\nu_{Kitaev}=2$
class.
