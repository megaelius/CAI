The location of the Frenkel line (FL) of a Lennard-Jones fluid which demarcates two distinct physical
states, liquidlike and gaslike within the supercritical regime, has been established through
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the velocity auto-correlation (VACF) and Radial distribution
Function (RDF). We, in this article, explore the changes in the structural features of supercritical
LJ-fluid under partial confinement using atomistic walls. The study is carried out across the FL
through a series of MD simulations considering a set of thermodynamics states in the supercritical
regime of Argon well above the critical point. Confinement is partial, with atomistic walls located
normal to z and extending to "infinity" along the x and y directions. In the "liquidlike" regime of
the supercritical phase, particles are distributed in distinct layers along the z with layer spacing
less than one atomic diameter and the lateral RDF showing amorphous-like structure for specific
spacings (packing frustration). Increasing the rigidity of the atomistic walls is found to lead
to stronger layering and increased structural order. For confinement with reflective walls, layers
are found to form with one atomic diameter spacing and the lateral RDF showing close-packed structure
for the smaller confinements. Translational order parameter and excess entropy assessment confirm
the ordering taking place for atomistic wall and reflective wall confinements. In the "gaslike"
regime of the supercritical phase, particle distribution along the spacing and the lateral RDF
exhibit features not significantly different from that due to the normal gas regime. The heterogeneity
across FL, found to be present both in bulk and confined systems, might cause the breakdown of the
universal scaling between structure and dynamics of fluids necessitating the determination of
a unique relationship between them.
