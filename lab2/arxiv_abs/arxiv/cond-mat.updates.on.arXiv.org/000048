The coupling parameter expansion in thermodynamic perturbation theory of simple fluids is generalized
to include the derivatives of bridge function with respect to coupling parameter. We applied the
theory to Square-Well (SW) and Lennard-Jones(LJ) fluids using Sarkisov Bridge function. In both
cases, the theory reproduced the radial distribution functions obtained from integral equation
theory (IET) and simulations with good accuracy. Also, the method worked in the liquid-vapor coexistence
region where the IETs are known to fail. In the case of SW fluids, use of Carnahan-Starling expression
for Helmholtz free energy density of Hard-Sphere reference system has improved the liquid-vapor
phase diagrams(LVPD) over that obtained from IET with the same bridge function. We also obtained
the surface tension for SW fluids of various ranges. Results of present theory and simulations are
in good agreement. In the case of LJ fluids, the equation of state obtained from the present method
matched with that obtained from IET with negligible deviation . We also obtained LVPD of LJ fluid
from virial and energy routes and found that there is slight inconsistency between the two routes.
The two applications above lead to following conclusions. In cases where reference system properties
are known accurately, the present method gives results which are very much improved over those obtained
from the IET with the same bridge function. In cases where reference system data is not available,
the method serves as an alternative way of solving the Ornstein-Zernike equation with a given closure
relation with the advantage that solution can be obtained throughout the phase diagram with a proper
choice of the reference system.
