We establish a correspondence between the electric dipole matrix elements of a polyatomic symmetric
top molecule in a state with nonzero projection of the total angular momentum on the symmetry axis
of the molecule and the magnetic dipole matrix elements of a magnetic dipole associated with an elemental
spin $F$. It is shown that this correspondence makes it possible to perform quantum simulation of
the single-particle spectrum and the dipole-dipole interactions of magnetic dipoles in a static
external magnetic field $\bf{B}$ with symmetric top molecules subject to a static external electric
field $\bf{E}_{\mathrm{DC}}$. We further show that no such correspondence exists for $^1\Sigma$
molecules in static fields, such as the alkali metal dimers. The effective spin angular momentum
of the simulated magnetic dipole corresponds to the rotational angular momentum of the symmetric
top molecule, and so quantum simulation of arbitrarily large integer spins is possible. Further,
taking the molecule CH$_3$F as an example, we show that the characteristic dipole-dipole interaction
energies of the simulated magnetic dipole are a factor of 620, 600, and 310 larger than for the highly
magnetic atoms Chromium, Erbium, and Dysprosium, respectively. We present several applications
of our correspondence for many-body physics, including long-range and anisotropic spin models
with arbitrary integer spin $S$ using symmetric top molecules in optical lattices, quantum simulation
of molecular magnets, and spontaneous demagnetization of Bose-Einstein condensates due to dipole-dipole
interactions. Our results are expected to be relevant as cold symmetric top molecules reach quantum
degeneracy through Stark deceleration and opto-electrical cooling.
