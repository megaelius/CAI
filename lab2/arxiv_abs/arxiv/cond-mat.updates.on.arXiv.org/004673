Presented here is the development and demonstration of a tunable cavity-enhanced terahertz frequency-domain
optical Hall effect technique. The cavity consists of at least one fixed and one tunable Fabry-P\'erot
resonator. The approach is suitable for enhancement of the optical signatures produced by the optical
Hall effect in semi-transparent conductive layer structures with plane parallel interfaces.
The physical principle is the constructive interference of electric field components that undergo
multiple optical Hall effect induced polarization rotations upon multiple light passages through
the conductive layer stack. Tuning one of the cavity parameters, such as the external cavity thickness,
permits shifting of the frequencies of the constructive interference, and enhancement of the optical
signatures produced by the optical Hall effect can be obtained over large spectral regions. A cavity-tuning
optical stage and gas flow cell are used as examples of instruments that exploit tuning an external
cavity to enhance polarization changes in a reflected terahertz beam. Permanent magnets are used
to provide the necessary external magnetic field. Conveniently, the highly reflective surface
of a permanent magnet can be used to create the tunable external cavity. The signal enhancement allows
the extraction of the free charge carrier properties of thin films, and can eliminate the need for
expensive super-conducting magnets. Furthermore, the thickness of the external cavity establishes
an additional independent measurement condition, similar to, for example, the magnetic field
strength, terahertz frequency, and angle of incidence. A high electron mobility transistor structure
and epitaxial graphene are studied as examples. We discuss the theoretical background, instrument
design, data acquisition, and data analysis procedures.
