In the design of materials with low lattice thermal conductivity, compounds with high density,
low speed of sound, and complexity at either the atomic, nano- or microstructural level are preferred.
The layered compound Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ defies these prevailing paradigms, exhibiting lattice thermal
conductivity comparable to PbTe and Bi$_2$Te$_3$, despite its low density and simple structure.
The excellent thermoelectric performance ($zT$ $\sim$ 1.5) in $n$-type Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ has thus
far been attributed to its multi-valley conduction band, while its anomalous thermal properties
have been largely overlooked. To explain the origin of the low lattice thermal conductivity of Mg$_3$Sb$_2$,
we have used both experimental methods and ab initio phonon calculations to investigate trends
in the elasticity, thermal expansion and anharmonicity of $A$Mg$_2Pn_2$ Zintl compounds with
$A$ = Mg, Ca, Yb, and $Pn$ = Sb and Bi. Phonon calculations within the quasi-harmonic approximation
reveal large mode Gr\"uneisen parameters in Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ compared with isostructural compounds,
in particular in transverse acoustic modes involving shearing of adjacent anionic layers. Measurements
of the elastic moduli and sound velocity as a function of temperature using resonant ultrasound
spectroscopy provide a window into the softening of the acoustic branches at high temperature,
confirming their exceptionally high anharmonicity. We attribute the anomalous thermal behavior
of Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ to the diminutive size of Mg, which may be too small for the octahedrally-coordinated
site, leading to weak, unstable interlayer Mg-Sb bonding. This suggests more broadly that soft
shear modes resulting from undersized cations provide a potential route to achieving low lattice
thermal conductivity low-density, earth-abundant materials.
