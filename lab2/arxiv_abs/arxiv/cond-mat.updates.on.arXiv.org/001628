The interaction between the spin current and magnetization of ferromagnetic insulator at the interface
has shown to cause modulation of the spin current through a metallic channel. The interfacial exchange
field at these interfaces can be probed by placing the interface in contact with the spin transport
channel and observing additional spin relaxation processes. We study interfacial exchange field
in non-local spin-valve (NLSV) devices where Cu spin transport channel is in proximity with ferromagnetic
insulator EuS (EuS-NLSV)and yttrium iron garnet Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG-NLSV). The spin signals
were compared with reference lateral spin-valve devices fabricated on nonmagnetic Si/SiO$_2$
substrate with MgO or AlO$_x$ capping. The nonlocal spin-valve signal is about 4 and 6 times lower
in the EuS-NLSV and YIG-NLSV, respectively. The suppression in the spin signal has been attributed
to enhanced surface spin-flip probability at the Cu-EuS (or Cu-YIG) interface due to interfacial
spin-orbit field. Besides spin signal suppression we also found widely observed low temperature
peak in the spin signal at $T \sim$30 K is shifted to higher temperature in the case of devices in contact
with EuS or YIG. Temperature dependence of spin signal for different injector-detector distances
reveal fluctuating exchange field at these interfaces cause additional spin decoherence which
limit spin relaxation time in addition to conventional sources of spin relaxation. Our results
show that temperature dependent measurement with pure spin current can be used to probe interfacial
exchange field at ferromagnetic insulator-nonmagnetic metal interface.
