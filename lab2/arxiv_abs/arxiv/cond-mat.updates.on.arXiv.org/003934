The ZrSiS-type compounds are Dirac semimetals and have been attracting considerable interest
in recent years due to their topological electronic properties and possible applications. In particular,
gapped Dirac nodes can possess large spin Berry curvatures and thus give rise to large spin Hall effect
(SHE) and spin Nernst effect (SNE), which may be used to generate pure spin current for spintronics
and spin caloritronics without applied magnetic field or magnetic material. In this paper we study
both SHE and SNE in ZrXY (X = Si, Ge; Y = S, Se, Te) based on \textit{ab initio} relativistic band structure
calculations. Our theoretical calculations reveal that some of these compounds exhibit large
intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and spin Nernst conductivity (SNC). The calculated SHC
of ZrSiTe is as large as -755 ($\hbar$/e)(S/cm). Since the electric conductivity of these Dirac
semimetals are much smaller than that of platinum which has the largest intrinsic SHC of $\sim$2200
($\hbar$/e)(S/cm), this indicates that they will have a larger spin Hall angle than that of platinum.
Remarkably, we find that both the magnitude and sign of the SHE and SNE in these compounds can be significantly
tuned by changing either the electric field direction or spin current direction and may also be optimized
by slightly varying the Fermi level via chemical doping. Analysis of the calculated band- and $k$-resolved
spin Berry curvatures show that the large SHE and SNE as well as their remarkable tunabilities originate
from the presence of many slightly spin-orbit coupling-gapped Dirac nodal lines near the Fermi
level in these Dirac semimetals. Our findings suggest that the ZrSiS-type compounds are promising
candidates for spintronic and spin caloritronic devices, and will certainly stimulate further
experiments on these Dirac semimetals.
