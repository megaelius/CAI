Owing to their low mass and outstanding mechanical figures of merit, graphene and related two-dimensional
(2D) materials are ideal building blocks for nano-electro-mechanical systems. At the same time,
2D materials are endowed with unique electronic, optical and phononic properties, suitable for
hybrid systems that couple their elementary excitations (excitons, phonons) and/or degrees of
freedom (spin, valley) to macroscopic flexural vibrations. The built-in nature of such hybrid
systems may yield enhanced strain-mediated coupling as compared to bulkier hybrid systems, e.g.,
comprising a single quantum emitter coupled to a nano-mechanical resonator. Here, using micro-Raman
scattering spectroscopy on circular drums made from pristine graphene monolayers, we demonstrate
dynamical softening of optical phonons induced by the macroscopic flexural motion of graphene.
This softening is an unambiguous fingerprint of dynamically-induced tensile strain that reaches
values up to $\mathbf{\approx 4 \times 10^{-4}}$ under strong non-linear driving. These anomalously
large strains exceed the time-averaged values predicted for harmonic vibrations with the same
root mean square (RMS) amplitude by more than one order of magnitude. We experimentally demonstrate
that the dynamical strain is proportional to the non-linear frequency shift of the mechanical resonance.
This key observation is rationalized using a non-linear mechanical model and allows us to attribute
the enhancement of dynamical strain to the strong non-linearities of graphene drums. Our work provides
an impetus for modelling non-linear dynamics in atomically thin electro-mechanical resonators,
including beyond elasticity theory and holds promise for dynamical strain engineering and dynamical
strain-mediated control of light-matter interactions, single-photon emission or magnetic order
in 2D materials and related heterostructures.
