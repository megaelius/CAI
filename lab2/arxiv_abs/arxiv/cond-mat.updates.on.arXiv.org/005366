The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials launched a fascinating frontier of flatland electronics.
Most crystalline atomic layer materials are based on layered van der Waals materials with weak interlayer
bonding, which naturally leads to thermodynamically stable monolayers. We report the synthesis
of a 2D insulator comprised of a single atomic sheet of honeycomb structure BeO (h-BeO), although
its bulk counterpart has a wurtzite structure. The h-BeO is grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
on Ag(111) thin films that are conveniently grown on Si(111) wafers. Using scanning tunneling microscopy
and spectroscopy (STM/S), the honeycomb BeO lattice constant is determined to be 2.65 angstrom
with an insulating band gap of 6 eV. Our low energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements indicate
that the h-BeO forms a continuous layer with good crystallinity at the millimeter scale. Moir\'e
pattern analysis shows the BeO honeycomb structure maintains long range phase coherence in atomic
registry even across Ag steps. We find that the interaction between the h-BeO layer and the Ag(111)
substrate is weak by using STS and complimentary density functional theory calculations. We not
only demonstrate the feasibility of growing h-BeO monolayers by MBE, but also illustrate that the
large-scale growth, weak substrate interactions, and long-range crystallinity make h-BeO an
attractive candidate for future technological applications. More significantly, the ability
to create a stable single crystalline atomic sheet without a bulk layered counterpart is an intriguing
approach to tailoring novel 2D electronic materials.
