Time and history dependent magnetization has been observed in a wide variety of materials, which
are collectively termed as the glassy magnetic systems. However, such systems showing similar
non-equilibrium magnetic response can be microscopically very different and they can be distinguished
by carefully looking into the details of the observed metastable magnetic behavior. Canonical
spin glass is the most well studied member of this class and has been extensively investigated both
experimentally and theoretically over the last five decades. In canonical spin glasses, the low
temperature magnetic state obtained by cooling across the spin glass transition temperature in
presence of an applied magnetic field is known as the field cooled (FC) state. This FC state in canonical
spin glass is widely believed as an equilibrium state arising out of a thermodynamic second order
phase transition. Here, we show that the FC state in canonical spin glass is not really an equilibrium
state of the system. We report careful dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements on two
canonical spin glass systems, AuMn (1.8%) and AgMn (1.1%). The dc magnetization in the FC state shows
clear temperature dependence. In addition, the magnetization shows a distinct thermal hysteresis
in the temperature regime below the spin glass transition temperature. On the other hand, the temperature
dependence of ac susceptibility has clear frequency dispersion below spin glass transition in
the FC state prepared by cooling the sample in the presence of a dc-bias field. We further distinguish
the metastable response of the FC state of canonical spin glass from the metastable response the
FC state in an entirely different class of glassy magnetic system namely magnetic glass, where the
non-equilibrium behavior is associated with the kinetic-arrest of a first order magnetic phase
transition.
