In many materials, formation of building blocks and their controlled-angle packings results into
develop various geometric anisotropic shaped particles. These trends are more pronounced in atoms
of many transition metals occupying more electrons. Monolayer triangular-shaped tiny particles
are prerequisite as they are the building blocks of such particles. When packets of nano energy shaping
in equilateral triangle are being placed over monolayer assembly of atoms dealing certain transition
state at atomically flat surface resulting into their binding in own shape. Simultaneously, atoms
of monolayer tiny particle arrange in one-dimensional arrays elongate from the centers along opposite
poles as per working force of surface format, thus, developing structure of smooth elements. Each
such tiny particle works as one unit under the maintenance of dealing immersing force resulting
into pack at common centre point to develop mono layer of developing certain shape particle through
filling the unfilled regions under exact control of force, which is not the case in developing distorted
particles. Originally, binding of such atoms is under the execution of electron-dynamics when
dealing neutral behavior of state require ground points at below ground surface. Tiny shaped particle
once in mono layer of developing certain shape particle deal localized gravity. On one step down
of mono layer under the force of gravity bind to structure of smooth elements to the following one
mono layer through electrons dealing lateral placement under contraction-expansion of clamping
energy knots. In different referred processes, developing particles of anisotropic shape appear
to deal such tiny particles. In this work, the basic idea of formation of such building block is discussed.
Study further sheds light on elongation of atoms of such tiny particles.
