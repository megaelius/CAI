Ultrafast laser irradiation of solids leads to a thermodynamic nonequilibrium within and between
the electron and phonon subsystems of the material. Due to electron-electron and phonon-phonon
collisions, both subsystems relax into respective new thermodynamic equilibria within a characteristic
thermalization time, which is different for each one of them. Moreover, they equilibrate their
temperatures by electron phonon coupling. The relaxation of the electronic nonequilibrium and
its effect on the electron phonon coupling was subject to a number of studies and it is comparably
well understood, while the nonequilibrium within the phononic subsystem is usually neglected
and its influence of the nonequilibrium phonons on other relaxation processes is unclear. Our calculations
show significant differences in the energy transfer rate between the electrons and the phonons
depending whether a nonequilibrium distribution is assumed for the phonons or not. Here, we present
a model to study the relaxation of the nonequilibrium phonon subsystem. Collisions between phonons
are described within the frame of Boltzmann integrals. From this, an energy-dependent relaxation
time can be extracted and inserted into a relaxation-time approach. Within the frame of this model,
we study the thermalization of a phonon distribution induced by ultrafast laser irradiation. We
show, that the thermalization time of such a distribution is of the order of some hundreds of picoseconds.
Moreover, we discuss the energy transfer between Fermi-distributed electrons and nonequilibrium
phonons and compare this to the energy transfer for equilibrium distributions in both subsystems.
