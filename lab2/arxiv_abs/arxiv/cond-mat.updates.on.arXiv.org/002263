Motion of a single electron in a disordered alloy and or interacting electrons systems such as magnetic
materials, strongly correlated systems and superconductors is replaced by motion of that in an
effective medium which is denoted by self-energy. The study of disordered alloy and interacting
electrons systems based on single electron motion is an old challenge and an important problem in
condensed matter physics. In this paper we introduce a real space approximation beyond super cell
approximation for the study of these systems to capture multi-site effects. Average disordered
alloy or interacting system is replaced by a self-energy, $\Sigma(i,j,E)$. We divided self-energy
in q-space $\Sigma({\bf q}; E)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{ij}e^{i{\bf q}.{\bf r}_{ij}}\Sigma(i,j;
E)$ into two parts $\Sigma({\bf q}; E)=\frac{1}{N_{c}}\sum_{IJ\in\; \mbox{\tiny same cluster}}e^{i{\bf
q}.{\bf r}_{IJ}}\Sigma(I,J; E)+\frac{1}{N}\sum_{ij\notin \:\mbox{\tiny same cluster}}e^{i{\bf
q}.{\bf r}_{IJ}}\Sigma(I,J,E)$ where $\{Lc_{1}, Lc_{2},Lc_{3}\}$ are dimensions of the super
cell. We show that neglecting the second term of q-space self-energy leads to super cell approximation
$e^{iq_{j} Lc_{j}}=1$, hence $ q_{j}$ determined by $ q_{j} Lc_{j}=2\pi n_{j}$. Then we kept this
correction in the second step to add self energies of sites in different super cells which leads to
fully q-dependent self energy in the first Brillouin zone (FBZ). Our self-energy in FBZ is casual,
fully q-dependent, and continuous with respect to ${\bf q}$. It recovers coherent potential approximation
in the single site approximation and is exact when the number of sites in the super cell approaches
to the total number of lattice sites. We illustrate that this approximation undertakes electrons
localization for one and two dimensional alloy systems which isn't observed by previous multi site
approximations.
