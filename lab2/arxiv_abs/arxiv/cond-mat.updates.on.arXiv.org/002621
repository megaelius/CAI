While coupled cluster theory accurately models weakly correlated quantum systems, it often fails
in the presence of strong correlations where the standard mean-field picture is qualitatively
incorrect. In many cases, these failures can be largely ameliorated by permitting the mean-field
reference to break physical symmetries. Symmetry-broken coupled cluster, e.g. Bogoliubov coupled
cluster, theory can indeed provide reasonably accurate energetic predictions, but the broken
symmetry can compromise the quality of the resulting wave function and predictions of observables
other than the energy. Merging symmetry projection and coupled cluster theory is therefore an appealing
way to describe strongly correlated systems. Independently, two different but related formalisms
have been recently proposed to achieve this goal. The two formalisms are contrasted in this manuscript,
with results tested on the Richardson pairing Hamiltonian. Both formalisms are based on the disentangled
cluster representation of the symmetry-rotated coupled cluster wavefunction. However, they
differ in the way that the disentangled clusters are solved. One approach sets up angle-dependent
coupled cluster equations, while the other involves first-order ordinary differential equations.
The latter approach yields energies and occupation probabilities significantly better than those
of number-projected BCS and BCS coupled cluster and, when the disentangled clusters are truncated
at low excitation levels, has a computational cost not too much larger than that of BCS coupled cluster.
The high quality of results presented in this manuscript indicates that symmetry-projected coupled
cluster is a promising method that can accurately describe both weakly and strongly correlated
finite many-fermion systems.
