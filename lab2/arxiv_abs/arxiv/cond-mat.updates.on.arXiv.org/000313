Using a microscopic finite-cluster tight-binding model, we investigate the trend of the magnetic
anisotropy energy as a function of the cluster size for an individual Mn impurity positioned in the
vicinity of the (110) GaAs surface,We present results of calculations for large cluster sizes,
containing approximately 104 atoms, which have not been investigated so far. Our calculations
demonstrate that the anisotropy energy of a Mn dopant in bulk GaAs found to be non-zero in previous
tight-binding calculations, is purely a finite size effect, and it vanishes as the inverse cluster
size. In contrast to this, we find that the splitting of the three in-gap Mn acceptor energy levels
converges to a finite value in the limit of infinite cluster size. For a Mn in bulk GaAs this feature
is related to the nature of the mean-field treatment of the coupling between the impurity and its
nearest neighbors atoms. Moreover, we calculate the trend of the anisotropy energy in the sublayers,
as the Mn dopant is moved away from the surface towards the center of the cluster. Here the use of large
cluster sizes allows us to position the impurity in deeper sublayers below the surface, compared
to previous calculations. In particular, we show that the anisotropy energy increases up to the
fifth sublayer and then decreases as the impurity is moved further away from the surface, approaching
its bulk value. The present study provides important insight for experimental control and manipulation
of the electronic and magnetic properties of individual Mn dopants at the semiconductor surface
by means of advanced scanning tunneling microscopy techniques.
