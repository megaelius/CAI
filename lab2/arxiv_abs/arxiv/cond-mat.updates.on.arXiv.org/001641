Graphene encapsulated in single crystal hexagonal boron nitride dielectrics and graphite gates
is an exceptionally tunable, high mobility electron system hosting a variety of robust fractional
quantum Hall states, including several thought to harbor nonabelian excitations. Most proposals
to demonstrate topological quantum bits using these states are based on mesoscopic transport measurements;
however transport measurements in dual-graphite gated devices are bedeviled by a host of issues
arising from the uncontrolled graphene crystal edges, which complicated quantitative studies.
Here we demonstrate the fabrication of edgeless devices with contacts only to the sample bulk--topologically
equivalent to the Corbino disk geometry. We use the resulting direct measurement of the bulk longitudinal
conductivity to perform quantitative studies of the FQH in monolayer graphene devices. We show
that a substrate-induced sublattice splitting combined with moderate magnetic field completely
lifts the spin- and valley degeneracy native to graphene, resulting in a highly particle-hole symmetric
zero energy Landau level with fractional quantum Hall gaps in excellent agreement with numerical
calculation. Across a wide range of magnetic field and density, we additionally find evidence for
spin textured excitations (at $\nu=-2/3, -4/3$), strongly broken particle hole symmetry in the
first excited Landau level, and a previously unreported phase transition between spin- and valley
ordered states at $\nu=-4$. Our results pave the way to precision tests of correlated physics in
graphene, and suggest new routes towards probing edge state physics in the FQH regime.
