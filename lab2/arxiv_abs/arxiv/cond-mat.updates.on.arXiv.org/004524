The steady motion and deformation of a lipid-bilayer vesicle translating through a circular tube
in low Reynolds number pressure-driven flow are investigated numerically using an axisymmetric
boundary element method. This fluid-structure interaction problem is determined by three dimensionless
parameters: reduced volume (a measure of the vesicle asphericity), geometric confinement (the
ratio of the vesicle effective radius to the tube radius), and capillary number (the ratio of viscous
to bending forces). The physical constraints of a vesicle -- fixed surface area and enclosed volume
when it is confined in a tube -- determine critical confinement beyond which it cannot pass through
without rupturing its membrane. The simulated results are presented in a wide range of reduced volumes
[0.6, 0.98] for different degrees of confinement; the reduced volume of 0.6 mimics red blood cells.
We draw a phase diagram of vesicle shapes and propose a shape transition line separating the parachute-like
shape region from the bullet-like one in the reduced volume versus confinement phase space. We show
that the shape transition marks a change in the behavior of vesicle mobility, especially for highly
deflated vesicles. Most importantly, high-resolution simulations make it possible for us to examine
the hydrodynamic interaction between the wall boundary and the vesicle surface at conditions of
very high confinement, thus providing the limiting behavior of several quantities of interest,
such as the thickness of lubrication film, vesicle mobility and its length, and the extra pressure
drop due to the presence of the vesicle. This extra pressure drop holds implications for the rheology
of dilute vesicle suspensions. Furthermore, we present various correlations and discuss a number
of practical applications.
