We present calculations of the charge density profile, subband occupancy and ellipsometry spectra
of the electron gas at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. The calculations employ self-consistent Hartree
and random phase approximations, a tight binding parametrization of the band structure and a model
for the optical phonon of SrTiO3. The dependence of the spatial structure and occupancy of subbands
on the magnitude of the polarization charge at the interface and the dielectric function is determined.
The interface-confined subbands may be labelled by the symmetry (xy, xz, or yz) of the Ti d-orbitals
from which they mainly derive. The xy-derived band nearest the interface contains the major proportion
of the electronic charge, but a large number of more distant, slightly occupied xy-derived bands
are also found. Depending on the magnitude of the polarization charge, zero, one, or two xz/yz derived
subbands are found. When present, these xz/yz bands give the dominant contribution to the long-distance
tail of the interface charge. The response to applied ac electric fields polarized parallel and
perpendicular to the interface is calculated and the results are presented in terms of ellipsometry
angles. Two features are found: a dip in the spectrum near the LO feature of the STO phonon and a peak
at the higher energy. We show that the form and magnitude of the dip is related to the Drude response
of carriers moving in the plane of the interface while the peak arises from the plasmon excitation
of the xz and yz electrons. The relation of the features of the subband occupancies and the in-plane
conductivities is given.
