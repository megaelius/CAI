The exact conditions for density functionals and density matrix functionals in terms of fractional
charges and fractional spins are known, and their violation in commonly used functionals has been
shown to be the root of many major failures in practical applications. However, approximate functionals
are not normally expressed in terms of the fractional variables. Here we develop a general framework
for extending approximate density functionals and many-electron theory to fractional-charge
and fractional-spin systems. Our development allows for the fractional extension of any approximate
theory that is a functional of $G^{0}$, the one-electron Green's function of the non-interacting
reference system. The extension to fractional charge and fractional spin systems is based on the
ensemble average of the basic variable, $G^{0}$. We demonstrate the fractional extension for the
following theories: (1) any explicit functional of the one-electron density, such as the LDA and
GGA; (2) any explicit functional of the one-electron density matrix of the non-interacting reference
system, such as the exact exchange functional and hybrid functionals; (3) many-body perturbation
theory; and (4) random-phase approximations. A general rule for such an extension has also been
derived through scaling the orbitals and should be useful for functionals where the link to the Green's
function is not obvious. The development thus enables the examination of approximate theories
against known exact conditions on the fractional variables and the analysis of their failures in
chemical and physical applications in terms of violations of exact conditions of the energy functionals.
The present work should facilitate the calculation of chemical potentials and fundamental band
gaps with approximate functionals and many-electron theories through the energy derivatives
with respect to the fractional charge.
