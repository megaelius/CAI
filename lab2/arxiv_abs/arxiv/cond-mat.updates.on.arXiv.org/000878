In recent years, numerical models have become popular and powerful tools to investigate the electromagnetic
behavior of superconductors. One domain where this advances are most necessary is the 3D modeling
of the electromagnetic behavior of superconductors. For this purpose, a benchmark problem consisting
of superconducting cube subjected to an AC magnetic field perpendicular to one of its faces has been
recently defined and successfully solved. In this work, a situation more relevant for applications
is investigated: a superconducting parallelepiped bulk with the magnetic field parallel to two
of its faces and making an angle with the other one without and with a further constraint on the possible
directions of the current. The latter constraint can be used to model the magnetization of a stack
of high-temperature superconductor tapes, which are electrically insulated in one direction.
For the present study three different numerical approaches are used: the Minimum Electro-Magnetic
Entropy Production (MEMEP) method, the $H$-formulation of Maxwell's equations and the Volume
Integral Method (VIM) for 3D eddy currents computation. The results in terms of current density
profiles and energy dissipation are compared, and the differences in the two situations of unconstrained
and constrained current flow are pointed out. In addition, various technical issues related to
the 3D modeling of superconductors are discussed and information about the computational effort
required by each model is provided. This works constitutes a concrete result of the collaborative
effort taking place within the HTS numerical modeling community and will hopefully serve as a stepping
stone for future joint investigations.
