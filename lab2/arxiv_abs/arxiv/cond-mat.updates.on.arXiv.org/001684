The curvature of a magnetic membrane was presented as a means of inducing nonreciprocities in the
spin-wave (SW) dispersion relation (see [Ot\'alora et al. Phys. Rev. Lett., 2016 117, 227203] and
[Ot\'alora et al. Phys. Rev. B., 2017 95, 184415]), thereby expanding the toolbox for controlling
SWs. In this paper, we further complement this toolbox by analytically showing that the membrane
curvature is also manifested in the absorption of SWs, leading to a difference in the frequency linewidth
(or lifetime) of counterpropagating magnons. Herein, we studied the nanotubular case, predicting
changes of approximately greater than 10% and up to 20% in the frequency linewidth of counterpropagating
SWs for a wide range of nanotube radii ranging from 30 nm to 260 nm and with a thickness of 10 nm. These
percentages are comparable to those that can be extracted from experiments on heavy metal/magnetic
metal sandwiches, wherein linewidth asymmetry results from an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI). We also show that the interplay between the frequency linewidth and group velocity
leads to asymmetries in the SW decay length, presenting changes between 10\% and 22\% for counterpropagating
SWs in the frequency range of 2 - 10 GHz. For the case of the SW dispersion relation, the predicted effects
are identified as the classical dipole-dipole interaction, and the analytical expression of the
frequency linewidth has the same mathematical form as in thin films with the DMI. Furthermore, we
present limiting cases of a tubular geometry with negligible curvature such that our analytical
model converges to the case of a planar thin film known from the literature. Our findings represent
a step forward toward the realization of three-dimensional curvilinear magnonic devices.
