Relaxation effects are of primary importance in the description of magnetic excitations, leading
to a myriad of methods addressing the phenomenological damping parameters. In this work, we consider
several well-established forms of calculating the intrinsic Gilbert damping within a unified
theoretical framework, mapping out their connections and the approximations required to derive
each formula. This scheme enables a direct comparison of the different methods on the same footing
and a consistent evaluation of their range of validity. Most methods lead to very similar results
for the bulk ferromagnets Fe, Co and Ni, due to the low spin-orbit interaction strength and the absence
of the spin pumping mechanism. The effects of inhomogeneities, temperature and other sources of
finite electronic lifetime are often accounted for by an empirical broadening of the electronic
energy levels. We show that the contribution to the damping introduced by this broadening is additive,
and so can be extracted by comparing the results of the calculations performed with and without spin-orbit
interaction. Starting from simulated ferromagnetic resonance spectra based on the underlying
electronic structure, we unambiguously demonstrate that the damping parameter obtained within
the constant broadening approximation diverges for three-dimensional bulk magnets in the clean
limit, while it remains finite for monolayers. Our work puts into perspective the several methods
available to describe and compute the Gilbert damping, building a solid foundation for future investigations
of magnetic relaxation effects in any kind of material.
