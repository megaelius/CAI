While the surface charge of solid particles is a direct consequence of their synthesis, the one of
suspended oil drops depends on the adsorption equilibrium of the surrounding molecules. The presence
of salt raises the polarity of the water phase, favoring the salting out of the surfactant from the
aqueous solution and increasing its surface excess. Yet, the electrolyte also screens the resulting
surface charge of the drops [Debye-H\"uckel, 1923]. As a result, the electrostatic surface potential
increases with the ionic strength until the saturation of the interface and then decreases. This
behavior produces a maximum previously observed in hexadecane-in-water nanoemulsions [Urbina-Villalba,
2013; 2015]. Here, the variation of the surface potential of two dodecane-in-water (d/w) nanoemulsions
is evaluated as a function of the sodium chloride concentration. As expected, maximum values are
obtained for concentrations of 0.5 and 7.5 mM sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). However, the surface
excess of dodecane drops shows an intermediate behavior between the adsorption equilibrium predicted
by macroscopic adsorption isotherms, and the one previously found on hexadecane drops. The stability
of the prepared emulsions was followed monitoring the change in the average radius of the dispersions
during five minutes, six times the lapse of time employed in a typical evaluation of the aggregation
rate. In the case of 7.5 mM SDS, the smallest change in size coincides with the maximum surface potential
found (40 mM NaCl). This is not observed for 0.5 mM SDS. Three regimes of destabilization are found
to exist depending on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase. They correspond to the prevalence
of: 1) solubilization/ripening, 2) aggregation, and 3) crystal precipitation.
