This article presents a measurement technique and data analysis tool to perform 3D grain distribution
mapping and indexing of oligocrystalline samples using neutrons: Laue three-dimensional neutron
diffraction (Laue3DND). The approach builds on forward modelling used for correlation and multiple
fitting of the measured diffraction spots relative to individual grains.This enables not only
to identify individual grains, but also their position and orientation in the sample. The feasibility
and performance of the Laue3DND approach are tested using multi-grain synthetic datasets from
cubic ({\alpha}-Fe) and tetragonal(YBaCuFeO5) symmetries. Next, experimental results from
two data sets measured at the FALCON instrument of Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin are presented: A cylindrical
alpha iron ({\alpha}-Fe) reference sample with 5 mm diameter and 5 mm height, as well as a 2 mm3 layered
perovskite (YBaCuFeO5). Using Laue3DND, we were able to retrieve the position and orientation
of 97 out of 100 grains from a synthetic{\alpha}-Fe data set, as well as 24 and 9 grains respectively
from the{\alpha}-Fe and YBaCuFeO5 sample measured at FALCON. Results from the synthetic tests
also indicate that Laue3DND is capable of indexing 10 out of 10 grains for both symmetries in two extreme
scenarios: using only 6 Laue projections and using 360 projections with extremely noisy data. The
precision achieved in terms of spatial and orientation resolution for the current version of the
method is 430{\mu}m and 1 degree respectively. Based on these results obtained, we are confident
to present a tool that expands the capabilities of standard Laue diffraction, providing the number,
position, orientation and relative size of grains in oligocrystalline samples.
