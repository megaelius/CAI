It has recently been proposed that combining chirality with topological band theory may result
in a totally new class of fermions. These particles have distinct properties: they appear at high
symmetry points of the reciprocal lattice, they are connected by helicoidal surface Fermi arcs
spanning the entire Brillouin zone, and they are expected to exist over a large energy range. Additionally,
they are expected to give rise to totally new effects forbidden in other topological classes. Understanding
how these unconventional quasiparticles propagate and interact is crucial for exploiting their
potential in innovative chirality-driven device architectures. These aspects necessarily rely
on the detection of handedness-dependent effects in the two enantiomers and remain largely unexplored
so far. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to visualize the electronic properties of both
enantiomers of the prototypical chiral topological semimetal PdGa at the atomic scale. We reveal
that the surface-bulk connectivity goes beyond ensuring the existence of topological Fermi arcs,
but also determines how quasiparticles propagate and scatter at impurities, giving rise to chiral
quantum interference patterns of opposite handedness and opposite spiralling direction for the
two different enantiomers, a direct manifestation of the change of sign of their Chern number. Additionally,
we demonstrate that PdGa remains topologically non-trivial over a large energy range, experimentally
detecting Fermi arcs in an energy window of more than 1.6 eV symmetrically centerd around the Fermi
level. These results are rationalized in terms of the deep connection between chirality in real
and reciprocal space in this class of materials, and they allow to identify PdGa as an ideal topological
chiral semimetal.
