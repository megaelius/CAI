"Science gateway" (SG) ideology means a user-friendly intuitive interface between scientists
(or scientific communities) and different software components + various distributed computing
infrastructures (DCIs) (like grids, clouds, clusters), where researchers can focus on their scientific
goals and less on peculiarities of software/DCI. "IMP Science Gateway Portal" ( this http URL ) for
complex workflow management and integration of distributed computing resources (like clusters,
service grids, desktop grids, clouds) is presented. It is created on the basis of WS-PGRADE and gUSE
technologies, where WS-PGRADE is designed for science workflow operation and gUSE - for smooth
integration of available resources for parallel and distributed computing in various heterogeneous
distributed computing infrastructures (DCI). The typical scientific workflows with possible
scenarios of its preparation and usage are presented. Several typical use cases for these science
applications (scientific workflows) are considered for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of complex behavior of various nanostructures (nanoindentation of graphene layers, defect system
relaxation in metal nanocrystals, thermal stability of boron nitride nanotubes, etc.). The user
experience is analyzed in the context of its practical applications for MD simulations in materials
science, physics and nanotechnologies with available heterogeneous DCIs. In conclusion, the
"science gateway" approach - workflow manager (like WS-PGRADE) + DCI resources manager (like gUSE)-
gives opportunity to use the SG portal (like "IMP Science Gateway Portal") in a very promising way,
namely, as a hub of various virtual experimental labs (different software components + various
requirements to resources) in the context of its practical MD applications in materials science,
physics, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnologies.
