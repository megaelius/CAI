In the paper we investigate statistical and topological properties of self-avoiding fractional
Brownian trajectories. The attention is paid to the sub-diffusive fractal Brownian motion (fBm)
producing compact spacial conformations with the fractal dimension $D_f\ge 2$ in the three-dimensional
space. The statistical properties of self-avoiding polymers with the fractal dimension $D_f>2$
are analyzed both numerically and via the Flory mean-field approach. Our study is motivated by an
attempt to mimic the conformational statistics of collapsed nonconcatenated polymer loops, which
are known to form on large scales the compact hierarchical crumpled globules (CG) with $D_f=3$.
Due to the nonlocal nature of topological interactions, the analytic and numeric treatment of CG
is an extremely difficult problem. Replacing the topologically-stabilized CG by the self-avoiding
fBm with properly adjusted fractal dimension, $D_f$, we tremendously simplify the problem of generating
the CG-like conformations since we wash out the topological constraints from the consideration.
To check whether a replacement of CG by self-avoiding fBm is plausible, we complute numerically,
using the Alexander polynomials, the distribution of the knot complexity, $P(\chi)$, of self-avoiding
fBm for $D_f =2.0,\, 2.08,\, 2.38$ in the 3D space. We show that with increasing $D_f$, typical fBm
polymer conformations become less and less knotted. The combination of Flory arguments with the
scaling analysis of self-avoiding fBm permits us to conjecture the dependence of the knot complexity,
$\chi$, on the effective Flory critical exponent, $\nu_e$. The found relation $\chi(\nu_e)$ is
supported by the Monte-Carlo simulations adjusted for generating the self-avoiding collapsed
fBm trajectories.
