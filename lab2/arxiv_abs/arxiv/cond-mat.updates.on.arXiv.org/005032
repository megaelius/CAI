Near a quantum-critical point in a metal a strong fermion-fermion interaction, mediated by a soft
boson, acts in two different directions: it destroys fermionic coherence and it gives rise to an
attraction in one or more pairing channels. The two tendencies compete with each other. We analyze
a class of quantum-critical models, in which the competition can be analyzed within an effective
model with dynamical electron-electron interaction $V(\Omega_m) \propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$
(the $\gamma$-model). In Paper I (arXiv:2004.13220) the two of us analyzed the $\gamma$-model
at $T=0$ for $0<\gamma <1$ and argued that there exist a discrete, infinite set of topologically
distinct solutions for the superconducting gap, all with the same spatial symmetry. The gap function
$\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ for the $n$-th solution changes sign $n$ times as the function of Matsubara
frequency. In this paper we analyze the linearized gap equation at a finite $T$. We show that there
exist an infinite set of pairing instability temperatures, $T_{p,n}$, and the eigenfunction $\Delta_n
(\omega_{m})$ changes sign $n$ times as a function of a Matsubara number $m$. We argue that $\Delta_n
(\omega_{m})$ retains its functional form below $T_{p,n}$ and at $T=0$ coincides with the $n$-th
solution of the non-linear gap equation. Like in Paper I, we extend the model to the case when the interaction
in the pairing channel has an additional factor $1/N$ compared to that in the particle-hole channel.
We show that $T_{p,0}$ remains finite at large $N$ due to special properties of fermions with Matsubara
frequencies $\pm \pi T$, but all other $T_{p,n}$ terminate at $N_{cr} = O(1)$. The gap function vanishes
at $T \to 0$ for $N > N_{cr}$ and remains finite for $N < N_{cr}$. This is consistent with the $T =0$ analysis.
