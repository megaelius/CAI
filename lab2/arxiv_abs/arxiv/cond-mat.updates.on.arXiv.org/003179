The ability of semipermeable membranes to selectively impede the transport of undesirable solutes
is key to many applications, including water desalination and chemical separation. Yet, the relationship
between a membrane's structure and its selectivity for different types of solutes is far from fully
understood. While experiments lack the spatiotemporal resolution necessary for probing the molecular
pathways of solute transport, conventional computational techniques cannot access timescales
relevant to solute transport through semipermeable membranes or are incapable of providing kinetic
information altogether. By utilizing jumpy forward-flux sampling (jFFS) [Haji-Akbari, J. Chem.
Phys., 149, 072303 (2018)], an advanced sampling technique recently developed by us, we are able
to circumvent these limitations, and to accurately estimate arbitrarily large mean passage times--
and arbitrarily small solute passage ratios. We use this method to investigate the transport of
sodium and chloride ions through a graphitic membrane with sub-nm pores, and compute solute passage
ratios as small as one ion per 10,000 solvent molecules, corresponding to a salt rejection of 99.99\%.
By analyzing the transition path ensemble, we identify two major impediments to ion transport through
the pore. In addition to its partial dehydration which is energetically and entropically disfavored,
its traversal through the pore generates a net electrostatic potential that pulls back the leading
ion through a net restraining force. While the role of partial dehydration in ion transport is widely
accepted, it is the first time that the crucial role of such electrostatic pull-back is revealed
at a molecular level.
