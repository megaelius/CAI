We present a proof of concept for a spectrally selective thermal mid-IR source based on nanopatterned
graphene (NPG) with a typical mobility of CVD-grown graphene (up to $3000$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$),
ensuring scalability to large areas. For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting
hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized
surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission
spectrum in the wavelength regime from 3 $\mu$m to 12 $\mu$m. The LSPs along with an optical cavity
increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby
outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared
(NIR) by a factor of 100. A maximum emission power per area of 11x10^3 W/m$^2$ at $T=2000$ K for a bias
voltage of $V=23$ V is achieved by Joule heating. By generalizing Planck's theory and considering
the nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in graphene
in RPA, we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons
can be as large as 13 $\mu$m and 150 $\mu$m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased
arrays. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission
in the range between $12^\circ$ and $80^\circ$ by tuning the Fermi energy. Our analysis of the nonlocal
hydrodynamic response leads to the conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene
are frequency-dependent. Using finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, coupled
mode theory, and RPA, we develop the model of a mid-IR light source based on NPG, which will pave the
way to graphene-based optical mid-IR communication, mid-IR color displays, mid-IR spectroscopy,
and virus detection.
