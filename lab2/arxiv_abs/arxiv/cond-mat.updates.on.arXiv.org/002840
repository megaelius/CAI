Our general interest is in self-consistent-field (scf) theories of disordered fermions. They
generate physically relevant sub-ensembles (``scf-ensembles'') within a given Altland-Zirnbauer
class. We are motivated to investigate such ensembles (i) by the possibility to discover new fixed
points due to (long-range) interactions; (ii) by analytical scf-theories that rely on partial
self-consistency approximations awaiting a numerical validation; (iii) by the overall importance
of scf-theories for the understanding of complex interaction-mediated phenomena in terms of effective
single-particle pictures. In this paper we present an efficient, parallelized implementation
solving scf-problems with spatially local fields by applying a kernel-polynomial approach. Our
first application is the Boguliubov-deGennes (BdG) theory of the attractive-$U$ Hubbard model
in the presence of on-site disorder; the scf-fields are the particle density $n(\mathbf{r})$ and
the gap function $\Delta(\mathbf{r})$. For this case, we reach system sizes unprecedented in earlier
work. They allow us to study phenomena emerging at scales substantially larger than the lattice
constant, such as the interplay of multifractality and interactions, or the formation of superconducting
islands. For example, we observe that the coherence length is a non-monotonous function of the disorder
strength already at moderate $U$. With respect to methodology our results are important because
we establish that partial self-consistency ("energy-only") schemes as typically employed in
analytical approaches tend to miss qualitative physics such as island formation.
