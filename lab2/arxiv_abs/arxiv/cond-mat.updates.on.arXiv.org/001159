We propose a scheme to realize the Kondo model with tunable anisotropy using alkaline-earth atoms
in an optical lattice. The new feature of our setup is Floquet engineering of interactions using
time-dependent Zeeman shifts, that can be realized either using state-dependent optical Stark
shifts or magnetic fields. The properties of the resulting Kondo model strongly depend on the anisotropy
of the ferromagnetic interactions. In particular, easy-plane couplings give rise to Kondo singlet
formation even though microscopic interactions are all ferromagnetic. We discuss both equilibrium
and dynamical properties of the system that can be measured with ultracold atoms, including the
impurity spin susceptibility, the impurity spin relaxation rate, as well as the equilibrium and
dynamical spin correlations between the impurity and the ferromagnetic bath atoms. We analyze
the non-equilibrium time evolution of the system using a variational non-Gaussian approach, which
allows us to explore coherent dynamics over both short and long timescales, as set by the bandwidth
and the Kondo singlet formation, respectively. In the quench-type experiments, when the Kondo
interaction is suddenly switched on, we find that real-time dynamics shows crossovers reminiscent
of poor man's renormalization group flow used to describe equilibrium systems. For bare easy-plane
ferromagnetic couplings, this allows us to follow the formation of the Kondo screening cloud as
the dynamics crosses over from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic behavior. On the other side
of the phase diagram, our scheme makes it possible to measure quantum corrections to the well-known
Korringa law describing the temperature dependence of the impurity spin relaxation rate. Theoretical
results discussed in our paper can be measured using currently available experimental techniques.
