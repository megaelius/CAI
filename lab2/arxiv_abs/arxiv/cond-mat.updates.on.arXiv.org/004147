Infrared (IR) radiation detectors are used in numerous applications from thermal imaging to spectroscopic
gas sensing and in various fields ranging from medicine to consumer products. Thermal radiation
detectors, or bolometers, which transform the radiation induced temperature rise of an absorber
to electrical signal, provide a cost effective route for IR radiation detection. By combining nano-thermoelectrics
and nanomembrane photonics, we demonstrate a 30 x 30 $\mu$m$^{2}$ uncooled long-wavelength IR
(LWIR) bolometer that is compatible with CMOS fabrication and exhibits a very small thermal time
constant of 67 $\mu$s. The 24.5 x 24.5 $\mu$m$^{2}$ absorber is a 30-nm-thick metallic grid with
low heat capacity, matched to vacuum impedance to guarantee high efficiency. The absorber is placed
in an on-chip cavity optimized for the radiation in the spectral region around 10 $\mu$m. The metal
grid is supported solely by the 80 nm thick nano-thermoelectric poly-crystalline silicon beams,
which convert the absorbed radiation into voltage. These transducer-support elements benefit
from reduced phonon thermal conductivity, especially, due to enhanced surface scattering. The
measured responsivity of the detector to LWIR radiation is 114 V/W, resulting in a specific detectivity
of $1\cdot10^{7}$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W and $4\cdot10^{7}$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W for contact and thermoelectric
beam resistance limited cases, respectively. We also show how the sensitivity of nano-thermoelectric
bolometers can be improved to reach specific detectivity levels above $1\cdot10^{9}$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W
without compromising the speed of the detector. To benchmark the performance of nano-thermoelectric
bolometers we briefly review the state-of-the art LWIR detectors.
