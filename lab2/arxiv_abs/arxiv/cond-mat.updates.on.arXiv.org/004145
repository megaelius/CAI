The energy vs. crystal momentum E(k) diagram for a solid ('band structure') constitutes the road
map for navigating its optical, thermodynamic and transport properties. By selecting crystals
with specific atom types, composition and symmetries one could design a target band structure and
thus desired properties. A particularly attractive outcome would be to design energy bands that
are split into spin components with a momentum-dependent splitting, enabling spintronic application.
The current paper provides theoretical evidence for wavevector dependent spin splitting of energy
bands that parallels the traditional Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) -induced
splitting, but originates from a fundamentally different source -- antiferromagnetism. Identifying
via theoretically derived design principles a compound (tetragonal MnF2) with the right magnetic
symmetry and performing density functional band structure calculations, reveals surprising,
hitherto unknown spin behaviors. Unlike the traditional SOC-induced effects restricted to non-centrosymmetric
crystals, we show that antiferromagnetic-induced spin splitting broadens the playing field to
include even centrosymmetric compounds, and is nonzero even without SOC, and consequently does
not rely on the often-unstable high atomic number elements required for high SOC, and yet is comparable
in magnitude to the best known ('giant') SOC effects. This work identifies predicted fingerprints
of the novel spin splitting mechanism to aid its eventual experimental measurements. It envisions
that the antiferromagnetic induced spin-split energy bands would be beneficial for efficient
spin-charge conversion and spin orbit torque applications without the burden of requiring compounds
containing heavy elements.
