Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial
epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network,
the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions.
We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with
implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain
model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor
weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable
of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further personalized
through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity
modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns.
Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the
subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii)seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic
sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the
connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the here
proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons
typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics using
graph theoretical metrics estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation.
This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial
epilepsy.
