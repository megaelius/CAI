Periodically driven systems exhibit resonance when the difference between an excited state energy
and the ground state energy is an integer multiple of $\hbar$ times the driving frequency. On the
other hand, when a superconducting phase difference is maintained between two superconductors,
subgap states appear which carry the Josephson current. A driven Josephson junction therefore
opens up an interesting avenue where the excitations due to applied driving affect the current flowing
from one superconductor to the other. Motivated by this, we study charge transport in a superconductor-normal
metal-superconductor system where oscillating potentials are applied in the normal metal region.
We find that for small amplitudes of the oscillating potential, driving at one site reverses the
direction of current at the superconducting phase differences when difference between the subgap
eigenenergies of the undriven Hamiltonian is integer multiple of $\hbar$ times the driving frequency.
For larger amplitudes of oscillating potential, driving at one site exhibits richer features.
We show that even when the two superconductors are maintained at same superconducting phase, a current
can be driven by applying oscillating potentials to two sites in the normal metal differing by a phase.
We find that when there is a nonzero Josephson current in the undriven system, the local peaks and
valleys in current of the system driven with an amplitude of oscillating potential smaller than
the superconducting gap indicates sharp excitations in the system. In the adiabatic limit, we find
that charge transferred in one time period diverges as a powerlaw with pumping frequency when a Josephson
current flows in the undriven system. Our calculations are exact and can be applied to finite systems.
