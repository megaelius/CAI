Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been widely used to predict the activity of catalysts
based on the free energies of reaction intermediates. The incorporation of the state of the catalyst
surface under the electrochemical operating conditions while constructing the free energy diagram
is crucial, without which even trends in activity predictions could be imprecisely captured. Surface
Pourbaix diagrams indicate the surface state as a function of the pH and the potential. In this work,
we utilize error-estimation capabilities within the BEEF-vdW exchange correlation functional
as an ensemble approach to propagate the uncertainty associated with the adsorption energetics
in the construction of Pourbaix diagrams. Within this approach, surface-transition phase boundaries
are no longer sharp and are therefore associated with a finite width. We determine the surface phase
diagram for several transition metals under reaction conditions and electrode potentials relevant
for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). We observe that our surface phase predictions for most
predominant species are in good agreement with cyclic voltammetry experiments and prior DFT studies.
We use the OH$^*$ intermediate for comparing adsorption characteristics on Pt(111), Pt(100),
Pd(111), Ir(111), Rh(111), and Ru(0001) since it has been shown to have a higher prediction efficiency
relative to O$^*$, and find the trend Ru>Rh>Ir>Pt>Pd for (111) metal facets, where Ru binds OH$^*$
the strongest. We robustly predict the likely surface phase as a function of reaction conditions
by associating c-values to quantifying the confidence in predictions within the Pourbaix diagram.
We define a confidence quantifying metric using which certain experimentally observed surface
phases and peak assignments can be better rationalized.
