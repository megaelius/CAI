Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for sub-10 nm transistor
channels due to their ultrathin body thickness, which results in strong electrostatic gate control.
Properly scaling a transistor technology requires reducing both the channel length (distance
from source to drain) and the contact length (distance that source and drain interface with semiconducting
channel). Contact length scaling remains an unresolved epidemic for transistor scaling, affecting
devices from all semiconductors, from silicon to 2D materials. Here, we show that clean edge contacts
to 2D MoS2 provide immunity to the contact-scaling problem, with performance that is independent
of contact length down to the 20 nm regime. Using a directional ion beam, in situ edge contacts of various
metal-MoS2 interfaces are studied. Characterization of the intricate edge interface using cross-sectional
electron microscopy reveals distinct morphological effects on the MoS2 depending on its thickness,
from monolayer to few-layer films. Chromium is found to outperform other metals in the edge contact
scheme, which is attributed to the shorter Cr-MoS2 bond length. Compared to scaled top contacts
with 20 nm contact length, in situ edge contacts yield better performance with an effective contact
length of ~ 1 nm and 18 times higher carrier injection efficiency. The in situ edge contacts also exhibit
~8 times higher performance compared to the best-reported edge contacts. Our work provides experimental
evidence for a solution to contact scaling in transistors, using 2D materials with clean edge contact
interfaces, opening a new way of designing devices with 2D materials.
