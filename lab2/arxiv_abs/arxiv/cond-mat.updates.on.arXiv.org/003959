Social media filters combined with recommender systems can lead to the emergence of filter bubbles
and polarized groups. In addition, segregation processes of human groups in certain social contexts
have been shown to share some similarities with phase separation phenomena in physics. Here, we
study the impact of information filtering on collective segregation behavior. We report a series
of experiments where groups of 22 subjects have to perform a collective segregation task that mimics
the tendency of individuals to bond with other similar individuals. More precisely, the participants
are each assigned a color (red or blue) unknown to them, and have to regroup with other subjects sharing
the same color. To assist them, they are equipped with an artificial sensory device capable of detecting
the majority color in their ``environment'' (defined as their $k$ nearest neighbors, unbeknownst
to them), for which we control the perception range, $k=1,3,5,7,9,11,13$. We study the separation
dynamics (emergence of unicolor groups) and the properties of the final state, and show that the
value of $k$ controls the quality of the segregation, although the subjects are totally unaware
of the precise definition of the ``environment''. We also find that there is a perception range $k=7$
above which the ability of the group to segregate does not improve. We introduce a model that precisely
describes the random motion of a group of pedestrians in a confined space, and which faithfully reproduces
and allows to interpret the results of the segregation experiments. Finally, we discuss the strong
and precise analogy between our experiment and the phase separation of two immiscible materials
at very low temperature.
