We analyze superconducting correlations in the one-dimensional Kondo lattice models with Ising
anisotropy under transverse magnetic fields, using the density matrix renormalization group.
For the spin-1/2 local spin model, the Ising anisotropy is introduced by the ferromagnetic Ising
interaction between the local spins, while for the spin-1 model, it is taken by the single-ion anisotropy.
The magnetic properties under the transverse fields for the spin-1/2 model are very similar to those
for the spin-1 model [K. Suzuki and K. Hattori, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 024707 (2019).]. For the superconducting
correlations, we analyze various Cooper pairs within nearest-neighbor pairs including composite
ones between the local spins and the electrons. We find that, for the spin-1/2 model, the superconducting
correlations are highly enhanced in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state near the Kondo-plateau
phase, where the conduction electrons and the local spins are strongly coupled with a finite spin
gap for the Ising axis. This is a clear contrast to the model under the longitudinal magnetic fields,
where there are no noticeable superconducting correlations. Competitions between the transverse
magnetic field and the Kondo singlet formation lead to this enhanced superconducting correlations.
For the spin-1 model, the single-ion anisotropy suppresses the superconducting correlation and
there is no noticeable enhancement. We also examine the large Kondo exchange coupling limit. For
the moderate ferromagnetic Ising interaction between the local spins, we find that another type
of superconducting correlation is enhanced inside the ferromagnetic phase. We discuss a possible
relation between our results and reentrant superconductivity in U-based ferromagnetic superconductors
under transverse magnetic fields.
