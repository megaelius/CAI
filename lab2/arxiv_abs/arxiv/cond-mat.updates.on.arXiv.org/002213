This is an introductory review of the physics of topological quantum matter with cold atoms. Topological
quantum phases, originally discovered and investigated in condensed matter physics, have recently
been explored in a range of different systems, which produced both fascinating physics findings
and exciting opportunities for applications. Among the physical systems that have been considered
to realize and probe these intriguing phases, ultracold atoms become promising platforms due to
their high flexibility and controllability. Quantum simulation of topological phases with cold
atomic gases is a rapidly evolving field, and recent theoretical and experimental developments
reveal that some toy models originally proposed in condensed matter physics have been realized
with this artificial quantum system. The purpose of this article is to introduce these developments.
The article begins with a tutorial review of topological invariants and the methods to control parameters
in the Hamiltonians of neutral atoms. Next, topological quantum phases in optical lattices are
introduced in some detail, especially several celebrated models, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model, the Hofstadter-Harper model, the Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model. The theoretical
proposals and experimental implementations of these models are discussed. Notably, many of these
models cannot be directly realized in conventional solid-state experiments. The newly developed
methods for probing the intrinsic properties of the topological phases in cold atom systems are
also reviewed. Finally, some topological phases with cold atoms in the continuum and in the presence
of interactions are discussed, and an outlook on future work is given.
