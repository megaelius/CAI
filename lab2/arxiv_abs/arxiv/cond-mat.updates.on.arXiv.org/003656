As is well known, energy levels appearing in the highly degenerate spectra of the $A_{N-1}$ type
of Haldane-Shastry and Polychronakos spin chains can be classified through the motifs, which are
characterized by some sequences of the binary digits like `0' and `1'. In a similar way, at present
we classify all energy levels appearing in the spectra of the $BC_N$ type of Polychronakos spin chains
with Hamiltonians containing supersymmetric analogue of polarized spin reversal operators.
To this end, we show that the $BC_N$ type of multivariate super Rogers-Szeg\"o (SRS) polynomials,
which at a certain limit reduce to the partition functions of the later type of Polychronakos spin
chains, satisfy some recursion relation involving a $q$-deformation of the elementary supersymmetric
polynomials. Subsequently, we use a Jacobi-Trudi like formula to define the corresponding $q$-deformed
super Schur polynomials and derive a novel expression for the $BC_N$ type of multivariate SRS polynomials
as suitable linear combinations of the $q$-deformed super Schur polynomials. Such an expression
for SRS polynomials leads to a complete classification of all energy levels appearing in the spectra
of the $BC_N$ type of Polychronakos spin chains through the `branched' motifs, which are characterized
by some sequences of integers of the form $(\delta_1, \delta_2,..., \delta_{N-1}|l)$, where $\delta_i
\in \{ 0,1 \}$ and $ l \in \{ 0,1,...,N \}$. Finally, we derive an extended boson-fermion duality relation
among the restricted super Schur polynomials and show that the partition functions of the $BC_N$
type of Polychronakos spin chains also exhibit similar type of duality relation.
