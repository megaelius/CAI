Quantitative predictions of the Li intercalation voltage and of the electronic properties of rechargeable
battery cathode materials are a substantial challenge for first-principles theory due to the possibility
of (1) strong correlations associated with localized transition metal $d$ electrons and (2) significant
van der Waals (vdW) interactions in layered systems, both of which are not accurately captured by
standard approximations to density functional theory (DFT). Here, we perform a systematic benchmark
of electronic structure methods based on the widely-used generalized gradient approximation
of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) and the new strongly constrained and appropriately normed
(SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation for battery cathode materials. Studying layered
Li$_x$TiS$_2$, Li$_x$NiO$_2$, and Li$_x$CoO$_2$, olivine Li$_x$FePO$_4$, and spinel Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$,
we compute the voltage, crystal structure, and electronic structure with and without extensions
to incorporate on-site Hubbard interactions and vdW interactions. Within pure DFT (i.e., without
corrections for on-site Hubbard interactions), SCAN is a significant improvement over PBE for
describing cathode materials, decreasing the mean absolute voltage error by more than 50%. Although
explicit vdW interactions are not critical and in cases even detrimental when applied in conjunction
with SCAN, Hubbard $U$ corrections are still in general necessary to achieve reasonable agreement
with experiment. We show that no single method considered here can accurately describe the voltage
and overall structural, electronic, and magnetic properties (i.e., errors no more than 5% for voltage,
volume, band gap, and magnetic moments) of battery cathode materials, motivating a strong need
for improved electronic structure approaches for such systems.
