We review the manifestations of many-body interactions in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides
(ML-TMDs) through changes in the optical spectra of excitons when the charge density is varied (e.g.,
by a gate voltage). On the one hand, the increased screening at elevated charge densities reduces
the binding energy of excitons leading to a blueshift of their spectral lines. On the other hand,
exchange and correlation effects shrink the band-gap energy at elevated densities, leading to
a redshift of the exciton spectral lines. While treatment of these competing effects using static
screening can describe them qualitatively, we show that including dynamical screening is essential
to resolve several experimental puzzles arising from a novel coupling between excitons and plasmons.
Unlike ubiquitous and well-studied plasmons, driven by collective oscillations of the background
charge density in the long-wavelength limit, we discuss the emergence of shortwave plasmons that
originate from the short-range Coulomb interaction through which electrons transition between
the $\textbf{K}$ and $-\textbf{K}$ valleys. By systematic inclusion of dynamical screening in
the Bethe-Salpeter Equation, we study the coupling between shortwave plasmons and neutral excitons.
We then elucidate how this coupling gives rise to an experimentally observed optical sideband in
electron-doped tungsten-based MLs, conspicuously absent in electron-doped molybdenum-based
MLs or any hole-doped ML-TMDs. While the focus of this review is on the optical manifestations of
many-body effects in ML-TMDs, the description of dynamical screening and its various approximations
allow one to revisit other phenomena, such as nonequilibrium transport or superconducting pairing,
where the use of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation or the emergence of shortwave plasmons can play an important
role.
