A deep neural network was developed for the purpose of predicting thermal conductivity with a case
study performed on neutron irradiated nuclear fuel. Traditional thermal conductivity modeling
approaches rely on existing theoretical frameworks that describe known, relevant phenomena that
govern the microstructural evolution processes during neutron irradiation (such as recrystallization,
and pore size, distribution and morphology). Current empirical modeling approaches, however,
do not represent all irradiation test data well. Here, we develop a machine learning approach to
thermal conductivity modeling that does not require a priori knowledge of a specific material microstructure
and system of interest. Our approach allows researchers to probe dependency of thermal conductivity
on a variety of reactor operating and material conditions. The purpose of building such a model is
to allow for improved predictive capabilities linking structure-property-processing-performance
relationships in the system of interest (here, irradiated nuclear fuel), which could lead to improved
experimental test planning and characterization. The uranium-molybdenum system is the fuel system
studied in this work, and historic irradiation test data is leveraged for model development. Our
model achieved a mean absolute percent error of approximately 4% for the validation data set (when
a leave-one-out cross validation approach was applied). Results indicate our model generalizes
well to never before seen data, and thus use of deep learning methods for material property predictions
from limited, historic irradiation test data is a viable approach.
