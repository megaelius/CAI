Results are presented for the quench dynamics of a clean and interacting electron system, where
the quench involves switching on the attractive interactions along general trajectories, including
both sudden and slow quenches. The initial state before the quench is assumed to be a normal electron
gas, and the dynamics is studied in a regime where long-range order is absent, but superconducting
fluctuations are important. A quantum kinetic equation using a two-particle irreducible formalism
is derived. Conservation of energy, particle-number, and momentum emerge naturally, with the
conserved currents depending on both electron Green's functions and Green's functions for the
superconducting fluctuations. The quantum kinetic equation is projected to a kinetic equation
for the current, and the transient optical conductivity relevant to pump-probe spectroscopy is
studied. The dynamics of the current is also justified by a phenomenological approach that assumes
model-F in the Halperin-Hohenberg classification, corresponding to a non-conserved order-parameter
coupled to a conserved density. Linear response conductivity and the diffusion coefficients in
thermal equilibrium are also derived, and connections with Aslamazov-Larkin fluctuation corrections
are highlighted. Results are also presented for the time-evolution of the local density of states.
It is shown that Andreev scattering processes result in enhanced density of states at low frequencies.
For a critical quench, the density of states is shown to grow in a manner where the time after the quench
plays the role of the inverse detuning from the critical point.
