Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP) are exploited due to their intriguing properties for photonic
circuits fabrication and miniaturization, for surface enhanced spectroscopies and imaging beyond
the diffraction limit. However, the excitation of these plasmonic modes by direct illumination
is forbidden by energy/momentum conservation rules. One strategy to overcome this limitation
relies on diffraction gratings to match the wavevector of the incoming photons with that of propagating
SPP excitations. The main limit of the approaches so far reported in literature is that they rely
on highly ordered diffraction gratings fabricated by means of demanding nano-lithographic processes.
In this work we demonstrate that an innovative, fully self-organized method based on wrinkling-assisted
Ion Beam Sputtering can be exploited to fabricate large area (cm^2 scale) nano-rippled soda-lime
templates which conformally support ultrathin Au films deposited by physical deposition. The
self-organized patterns act as quasi-1D gratings characterized by a remarkably high spatial order
which matches properly the transverse photon coherence length. The gratings can thus enable the
excitation of hybrid SPP modes confined at the Au/dielectric interfaces, with a resonant wavelength
which can be tuned either by modifying the grating period, photon incidence angle or, potentially,
the choice of the thin film conductive material. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering experiments
show promising gains in the range of 10^3 which are competitive, even before a systematic optimization
of the sample fabrication parameters, with state-of-the art lithographic systems, demonstrating
the potential of such templates for a broad range of optoelectronic applications aiming at plasmon-enhanced
photon harvesting for molecular or bio-sensing.
