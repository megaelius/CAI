Molecular-scale manipulation of electronic/ionic charge accumulation in materials is a preeminent
challenge, particularly in electrochemical energy storage. Layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals
exemplify a diverse family of materials that permit ions to reversibly associate with a host atomic
lattice by intercalation into interlamellar gaps. Motivated principally by the search for high-capacity
battery anodes, ion intercalation in composite materials is a subject of intense study. Yet the
precise role and ability of heterolayers to modify intercalation reactions remains elusive. Previous
studies of vdW hybrids represented ensemble measurements at macroscopic films/powders, which
do not permit the isolation and investigation of the chemistry at individual 2-dimensional (2D)
interfaces. Here, we demonstrate the intercalation of lithium at the level of individual atomic
interfaces of dissimilar vdW layers. Electrochemical devices based on vdW heterostructures comprised
of deterministically stacked hexagonal boron nitride, graphene (G) and molybdenum dichalcogenide
(MoX2; X = S, Se) layers are fabricated, enabling the direct resolution of intermediate stages in
the intercalation of discrete heterointerfaces and the extent of charge transfer to individual
layers. Operando magnetoresistance and optical spectroscopy coupled with low-temperature quantum
magneto-oscillation measurements show that the creation of intimate vdW heterointerfaces between
G and MoX2 engenders over 10-fold accumulation of charge in MoX2 compared to MoX2/MoX2 homointerfaces,
while enforcing a more negative intercalation potential than that of bulk MoX2 by at least 0.5 V.
Beyond energy storage, our new combined experimental and computational methodology to manipulate
and characterize the electrochemical behavior of layered systems opens up new pathways to control
the charge density in 2D (opto)electronic devices.
