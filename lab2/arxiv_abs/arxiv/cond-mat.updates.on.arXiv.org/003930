Vertical packaging of multiple Giant Magnetoresistance (multi-GMR) stacks is a very interesting
noise reduction strategy for local magnetic sensor measurements, which has not been reported experimentally
so far. Here, we have fabricated multi-GMR sensors (up to 12 repetitions) keeping good GMR ratio,
linearity and low roughness. From magnetotransport measurements, two different resistance responses
have been observed with a crossover around 5 GMR repetitions: step-like (N<5) and linear (N>5) behavior,
respectively. With the help of micromagnetic simulations, we have analyzed in detail the two main
magnetic mechanisms: the Neel coupling distribution induced by the roughness propagation and
the additive dipolar coupling between the N free layers. Furthermore we have correlated the dipolar
coupling mechanism, controlled by the number of GMRs (N) and lateral dimensions (width), to the
sensor performance (sensitivity, noise and detectivity) in good agreement with analytical theory.
The noise roughly decreases in multi-GMRs as 1/\sqrt{N} in both regimes (low frequency 1/f and thermal
noise). The sensitivity is even stronger reduced, scaling as 1/N, in the strong dipolar regime (narrow
devices) while converges to a constant value in the weak dipolar regime (wide devices). Very interestingly,
they are more robust against undesirable RTN noise than single GMRs at high voltages and the linearity
can be extended towards much larger magnetic field range without dealing with the size and the reduction
of GMR ratio. Finally, we have identified the optimal conditions for which multi-GMRs exhibit lower
magnetic field detectivity than single GMRs: wide devices operating in the thermal regime where
much higher voltage can be applied without generating remarkable magnetic noise.
