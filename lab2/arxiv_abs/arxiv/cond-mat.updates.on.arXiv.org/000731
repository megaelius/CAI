We study metastability of a Mott-insulator and a charge density wave in an extended Bose-Hubbard
model with global-range interactions. The model is realized by loading a degenerate $^{87}$Rb
Bose gas into a three-dimensional optical lattice. The global-range interactions are mediated
by photons dispersively scattered from a lattice beam - off the quantum gas - into an optical cavity
mode. Initializing the system in a Mott insulating state, we rapidly increase the strength of global-range
interactions to different final values. We observe that the system falls into either of two possible
final states, which is one signature of metastability. This is achieved by monitoring the photon
flux leaking from the cavity, which is determined by the atomic density modulation. We associate
a state possessing a small density modulation (low photon flux) with a Mott insulator, and a state
possessing a large density modulation (high photon flux) with a charge density wave. In additional
experiments, we slowly increase the strength of global-range interactions and subsequently decrease
it again, and observe a hysteresis loop between the two states, which is a second signature of metastability.
Furthermore, based on an analysis of an extended Bose-Hubbard model in the zero tunneling limit,
we confirm that the observed metastability can arise from strong and competing short- and global-range
interactions. The transition between the two observed states requires a local redistribution
of a large number of particles. The analysis of the observed temporal dynamics of the transition
suggests that a collective tunneling process is triggered.
