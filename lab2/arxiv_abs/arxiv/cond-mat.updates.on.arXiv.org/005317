A Brownian dynamics simulation algorithm is used to describe the static behaviour of associative
polymer solutions across a range of concentrations into the semidilute unentangled regime. Predictions
for the fractions of stickers bound by intra-chain and inter-chain association, as a function of
system parameters such as the number of stickers on a chain, the number of backbone monomers between
stickers, the solvent quality, and monomer concentration are obtained. A systematic comparison
between simulation results and scaling relations predicted by the mean-field theory of Dobrynin
(Macromolecules, 37, 3881, 2004) is carried out. Simulation results validate the predictions
of the mean-field theory across a wide range of parameter values in all but one of the scaling regimes.
The value of the des Cloizeaux exponent, $\theta_2 = 1/3$, proposed by Dobrynin for sticky polymer
solutions, is shown to lead to a collapse of simulation data for all the scaling relations considered
here. Three different signatures for the characterisation of gelation are identified, with each
leading to a different value of the concentration at the sol-gel transition. The Flory-Stockmayer
expression relating the degree of inter-chain conversion at the sol-gel transition to the number
of stickers on a chain is found not to be validated by simulations, while an alternative expression
is satisfied by all three gelation signatures. Simulation results confirm the prediction of scaling
theory for the gelation line that separates sol and gel phases, when the revised Flory-Stockmayer
expression is used. Phase separation is found to occur with increasing concentration for systems
in which the backbone monomers are under $\theta$-solvent conditions, and is shown to coincide
with a breakdown in the predictions of scaling theory.
