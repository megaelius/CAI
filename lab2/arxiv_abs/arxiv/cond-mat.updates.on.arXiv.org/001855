The influence of rotomagnetic (RM), rotoelectric (RE) and magnetoelectric (ME) coupling on phase
diagram and properties of antiferrodistortive (AFD) perovskite oxides was reviewed. The main
examples we consider in the review are typical AFD perovkites, such as incipient ferroelectrics
EuTiO3, SrTiO3, EuxSr1-xTiO3, multiferroic BiFeO3 and Bi1-xRxFeO3 (x = La, Nd). The strong influence
of RM, RE and ME couplings on the physical properties and phase diagrams including antiferromagnetic
(AFM), ferroelectric (FE) and structural AFD phases has been revealed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire
(LGD) theory, as well as the prediction of novel (double and triple) multiferroic phases has been
demonstrated. In the review we are especially focused on (a) the possibility to induce FM (FE) phase
in EuTiO3 (as well as in other paraelectric AFM oxides) by the application of an electric (magnetic)
field due to the ME coupling; (b) the analysis of the size effects and novel phases in EuxSr1-xTiO3
nanosystems, where the LGD predicts the presence of the triple AFD-FE-FM(AFM) phase at low temperatures;
(c) the appearance of improper spontaneous polarization and pyroelectricity in the vicinity of
antiphase domain boundaries, structural twin walls, surfaces and interphases in the AFD phase
of non-ferroelectric SrTiO3 induced by the flexoelectricity and rotostriction; (d) the occurrence
of low symmetry monoclinic phase with in-plane FE polarization in thin strained EuxSr1-xTiO3 films
and its stabilization over wide temperature range by AFD oxygen octahedron tilts due to flexoelectric
and rotostriction coupling; (e) discussion of a surprisingly strong size-induced increase of
AFM transition temperature caused by the joint action of RM coupling with elastic stress accumulated
in the intergrain spaces of BiFeO3 dense ceramics.
