In the finite difference method which is commonly used in computational micromagnetics, the demagnetizing
field is usually computed as a convolution of the magnetization vector field with the demagnetizing
tensor that describes the magnetostatic field of a cuboidal cell with constant magnetization.
An analytical expression for the demagnetizing tensor is available, however at distances far from
the cuboidal cell, the numerical evaluation of the analytical expression can be very inaccurate.
Due to this large-distance inaccuracy numerical packages such as OOMMF compute the demagnetizing
tensor using the explicit formula at distances close to the originating cell, but at distances far
from the originating cell a formula based on an asymptotic expansion has to be used. In this work,
we describe a method to calculate the demagnetizing field by numerical evaluation of the multidimensional
integral in the demagnetization tensor terms using a sparse grid integration scheme. This method
improves the accuracy of computation at intermediate distances from the origin. We compute and
report the accuracy of (i) the numerical evaluation of the exact tensor expression which is best
for short distances, (ii) the asymptotic expansion best suited for large distances, and (iii) the
new method based on numerical integration, which is superior to methods (i) and (ii) for intermediate
distances. For all three methods, we show the measurements of accuracy and execution time as a function
of distance, for calculations using single precision (4-byte) and double precision (8-byte) floating
point arithmetic. We make recommendations for the choice of scheme order and integrating coefficients
for the numerical integration method (iii).
