On the basis of coupled Ginzburg--Landau equations we study nonhomogeneous states in systems with
two order parameters (OP). Superconductors with superconducting OP $\Delta$, and charge- or spin-density
wave (CDW or SDW) with amplitude $W$ are examples of such systems. When one of OP, say $\Delta$, has
a form of a topological defect, like, e.g., vortex or domain wall between the domains with the phases
$0$ and $\pi$, the other OP $W$ is determined by the Gross--Pitaevskii equation and is localized
at the center of the defect. We consider in detail the domain wall defect for $\Delta$ and show that
the shape of the associated solution for $W$ depends on temperature and doping (or on the curvature
of the Fermi surface) $\mu$. It turns out that, provided temperature or doping level are close to
some discrete values $T_{n}$ and $\mu_{n}$, the spacial dependence of the function $W(x)$ is determined
by the form of the eigenfunctions of the linearized Gross--Pitaevskii equation. The spacial dependence
of $W_{0}$ corresponding to the ground state has the form of a soliton, while other possible solutions
$W_{n}(x)$ have nodes. Inverse situation when $W(x)$ has the form of a topological defect and $\Delta(x)$
is localized at the center of this defect is also possible. In particular, we predict a surface or
interfacial superconductivity in a system where a superconductor is in contact with a material
that suppresses $W$. This superconductivity should have rather unusual temperature dependence
existing only in certain intervals of temperature. Possible experimental realizations of such
non-homogeneous states of OPs are discussed.
