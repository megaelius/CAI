The observed filling factors in the fractional quantum Hall effect are, in many cases, successfully
supported by established theories, such as composite fermion theory and conformal field theory,
which routinely show agreement for discerning properties such as the topological indices and ground-state
overlaps. There are, however, several important cases where the theories themselves disagree,
which leaves verification in experiment ambiguous. One such example is the statistics of the elementary
excitations supported by the ground state at $\nu=2/5$ filling, where composite fermion theory
predicts an Abelian Jain state, whereas conformal field theory predicts a non-Abelian Gaffnian.
In a recent paper [Yang et al., PRB 100, 245303 (2019)] it is argued that this discrepancy is due to
implicit assumptions of short-range interactions in the composite fermion approach. We complement
this work by numerically investigating the contested ground-state statistics for the $\nu=2/5$
and $3/7$ states in the Hofstadter model. For this, we perform many-body simulations using the infinite
density matrix renormalization group to compute the area law of entanglement for varying interaction
range. From a detailed analysis of the topological entanglement entropies, we confirm the effective
Abelian statistics for these states in the case of short-range interactions, and we quantify the
onset of non-Abelian topological order. We demonstrate that not only the contested states at $\nu=2/5$
and $3/7$, but also the Laughlin filling factors, show an increase in topological entanglement
entropy as the interaction range is increased.
