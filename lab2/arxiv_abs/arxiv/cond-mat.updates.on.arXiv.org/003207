We study the reduced time-evolution of open quantum systems by combining quantum-information
and statistical field theory. Inspired by prior work [EPL 102, 60001 (2013) and Phys. Rev. Lett.
111, 050402 (2013)] we establish the explicit structure guaranteeing the complete positivity
(CP) and trace-preservation (TP) of the real-time evolution expansion in terms of the microscopic
system-environment coupling. This reveals a fundamental two-stage structure of the coupling
expansion: Whereas the first stage defines the dissipative timescales of the system --before having
integrated out the environment completely-- the second stage sums up elementary physical processes
described by CP superoperators. This allows us to establish the nontrivial relation between the
(Nakajima-Zwanzig) memory-kernel superoperator for the density operator and novel memory-kernel
operators that generate the Kraus operators of an operator-sum. Importantly, this operational
approach can be implemented in the existing Keldysh real-time technique and allows approximations
for general time-nonlocal quantum master equations to be systematically compared and developed
while keeping the CP and TP structure explicit. Our considerations build on the result that a Kraus
operator for a physical measurement process on the environment can be obtained by 'cutting' a group
of Keldysh real-time diagrams 'in half'. This naturally leads to Kraus operators lifted to the system
plus environment which have a diagrammatic expansion in terms of time-nonlocal memory-kernel
operators. These lifted Kraus operators obey coupled time-evolution equations which constitute
an unraveling of the original Schr\"odinger equation for system plus environment. Whereas both
equations lead to the same reduced dynamics, only the former explicitly encodes the operator-sum
structure of the coupling expansion.
