An entangled quantum state of two or more particles or objects exhibits some of the most peculiar
features of quantum mechanics. Entangled systems cannot be described independently of each other
even though they may have an arbitrarily large spatial separation. Reconciling this property with
the inherent uncertainty in quantum states is at the heart of some of the most famous debates in the
development of quantum theory. Nonetheless, entanglement nowadays has a solid theoretical and
experimental foundation, and it is the crucial resource behind many emerging quantum technologies.
Entanglement has been demonstrated for microscopic systems, such as with photons, ions, and electron
spins, and more recently in microwave and electromechanical devices. For macroscopic objects,
however, entanglement becomes exceedingly fragile towards environmental disturbances. A major
outstanding goal has been to create and verify the entanglement between the motional states of slowly-moving
massive objects. Here, we carry out such an experimental demonstration, with the moving bodies
realized as two micromechanical oscillators coupled to a microwave-frequency electromagnetic
cavity that is used to create and stabilise the entanglement of the centre-of-mass motion of the
oscillators. We infer the existence of entanglement in the steady state by combining measurement
of correlated mechanical fluctuations with an analysis of the microwaves emitted from the cavity.
Our work qualitatively extends the range of entangled physical systems, with implications in quantum
information processing, precision measurement, and tests of the limits of quantum mechanics.
