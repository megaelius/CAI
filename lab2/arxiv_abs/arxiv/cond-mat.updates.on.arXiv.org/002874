The dynamics of geometrically non-linear flexible filaments play an important role in a host of
biological processes, from flagella-driven cell transport to the polymeric structure of complex
fluids. Such problems have historically been computationally expensive due to numerical stiffness
associated with the inextensibility constraint, as well as the often non-trivial boundary conditions
on the governing high-order PDEs. Formulating the problem for the evolving shape of a filament via
an integral equation in the tangent angle has recently been found to greatly alleviate this numerical
stiffness. In this manuscript, we combine this approach with the method of regularized stokeslets
to enable the computationally-efficient simulation of multiple filaments interacting non-locally.
The proposed method is benchmarked against a non-local bead and link model, and recent code utilizing
a local drag velocity law. Systems of multiple filaments (1) in a background fluid flow, (2) under
a constant body force, and (3) undergoing active self-motility are modeled efficiently. Buckling
instabilities are analyzed by examining the evolving filament curvature, as well as by coarse-graining
the body frame tangent angles using a Chebyshev approximation for various choices of the relevant
non-dimensional parameters. From these experiments, insight is gained into how filament-filament
interactions can promote buckling, and further reveal the complex fluid dynamics resulting from
arrays of these interacting fibers. By examining active moment-driven filaments, we investigate
the speed of worm- and sperm-like swimmers for different governing parameters. The MATLAB (R) implementation
is made available as an open-source library, enabling flexible extension for alternate discretizations
and different surrounding flows.
