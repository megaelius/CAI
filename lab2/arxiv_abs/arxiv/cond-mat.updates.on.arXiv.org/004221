High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are at the focus of current research for their diverse properties, including
superconductivity and structural polymorphism. However, the polymorphic transition has been
observed only in nonsuperconducting HEAs and mostly under high pressure. Here we report the discovery
of superconductivity and temperature-driven polymorphism in the (V$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$)$_{3-x}$Mo$_{x}$Al$_{0.5}$Ga$_{0.5}$
(0.2 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1.4) HEAs. It is found that the as-cast HEA is of a single body-centered cubic
(bcc) structure for $x$ = 0.2 and a mixture of the bcc and A15 structures for higher $x$ values. Upon
annealing, the bcc structure undergoes a polymorphic transformation to the A15 one and all HEAs
exhibits bulk superconductivity. For $x$ = 0.2, whereas the bcc polymorph is not superconducting
down to 1.8 K, the A15 polymorph has a superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of 10.2
K and an estimated zero-temperature upper critical field $B_{\rm c2}$(0) of 20.1 T, both of which
are the highest among HEA superconductors. With increasing Mo content $x$, both $T_{\rm c}$ and
$B_{\rm c2}$(0) of the A15-type HEAs decrease, yet the large ratio of $B_{\rm c2}$(0)/$T_{\rm c}$
signifies a disorder-induced enhancement of the upper critical field over a wide $x$ range. The
decrease in $T_{\rm c}$ is attributed to the decrease in both the electronic specific-heat coefficient
and electron-phonon coupling strength. Furthermore, the valence electron count dependence of
$T_{\rm c}$, which is different from both the binary A15 and other structurally different HEA superconductors,
suggests that $T_{\rm c}$ may be increased further by reducing the number of valence electrons.
Our results not only uncover HEA superconductors of a new structural type, but also provide the first
example of polymorphism dependent superconductivity in HEAs.
