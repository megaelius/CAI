Unravelling the composition and characteristics of gas and dust lost by asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars is important as these stars play a vital role in the chemical life cycle of galaxies. The
general hypothesis of their mass loss mechanism is a combination of stellar pulsations and radiative
pressure on dust grains. However, current models simplify dust formation, which starts as a microscopic
phase transition called nucleation. Various nucleation theories exist, yet all assume chemical
equilibrium, growth restricted by monomers, and commonly use macroscopic properties for a microscopic
process. Such simplifications for initial dust formation can have large repercussions on the type,
amount, and formation time of dust. By abandoning equilibrium assumptions, discarding growth
restrictions, and using quantum mechanical properties, we have constructed and investigated
an improved nucleation theory in AGB wind conditions for four dust candidates, TiO$_2$, MgO, SiO
and Al$_2$O$_3$. This paper reports the viability of these candidates as first dust precursors
and reveals implications of simplified nucleation theories. Monomer restricted growth underpredicts
large clusters at low temperatures and overpredicts formation times. Assuming the candidates
are present, Al$_2$O$_3$ is the favoured precursor due to its rapid growth at the highest considered
temperatures. However, when considering an initially atomic chemical mixture, only TiO$_2$-clusters
form. Still, we believe Al$_2$O$_3$ to be the prime candidate due to substantial physical evidence
in presolar grains, observations of dust around AGB stars at high temperatures, and its ability
to form at high temperatures and expect the missing link to be insufficient quantitative data of
Al-reactions.
