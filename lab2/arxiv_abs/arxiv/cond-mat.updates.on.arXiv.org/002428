Boron nitride (BN) is a material with outstanding technological promise because of its exceptional
thermochemical stability, structural, electronic and thermal conductivity properties, and
extreme hardness. Yet, the relative thermodynamic stability of its most common polymorphs (diamond-like
cubic and graphite-like hexagonal) has not been resolved satisfactorily because of the crucial
role played by kinetic factors in the formation of BN phases at high temperatures and pressures (experiments),
and by competing bonding, electrostatic and many-body dispersion forces in BN cohesion (theory).
This lack of understanding hampers the development of potential technological applications,
and challenges the boundaries of fundamental science. Here, we use high-level first-principles
theories that correctly reproduce all important electronic interactions (the adiabatic-connection
fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the random phase approximation) to estimate with unprecedented
accuracy the energy differences between BN polymorphs, and thus overcome the accuracy hurdle that
hindered previous theoretical studies. We show that the ground-state phase of BN is cubic and that
the frequently observed hexagonal polymorph becomes entropically stabilized over the cubic at
temperatures slightly above ambient conditions ($T_{\rm c \to h} = 335 \pm 30$ K). We also reveal
a low-symmetry monoclinic phase that is extremely competitive with the other low-energy polymorphs
and which could explain the origins of the experimentally observed "compressed h-BN" phase. Our
theoretical findings therefore should stimulate new experimental efforts in bulk BN as well as
promote the use of high-level theories in modelling of technologically relevant van der Waals materials.
