A classical way of describing a dielectric function employs sums of contributions from damped harmonic
oscillators. Each term leads to a maximum in the imaginary part of the dielectric function at the
transversal optical (TO) resonance frequency of the corresponding oscillator. In contrast, the
peak maxima of the negative imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function are attributed to
the so-called longitudinal optical (LO) oscillator frequencies. The shapes of the corresponding
bands resemble those of the imaginary part of the dielectric function. Therefore, it seems natural
to also employ sums of the contributions of damped harmonic oscillators to describe the imaginary
part of the inverse dielectric function. In this contribution, we derive the corresponding dispersion
relations to investigate and establish the relationship between the transversal and longitudinal
optical oscillator strength, which can differ, according to experimental results, by up to three
orders of magnitude. So far, these differences are not understood and prevent the longitudinal
optical oscillator strengths from proper interpretation. We demonstrate that transversal and
longitudinal oscillator strengths should be identical for a single oscillator and that the experimental
differences are in this case due to the introduction of a dielectric background in the dispersion
formula. For this effect we derive an exact correction. Based on this correction we further derive
a modified Kramers-Kronig sum rule for the isotropic case as well as for the components of the inverse
dielectric function tensor. For systems with more than one oscillator, our model for the isotropic
case can be extended to yield oscillator strengths and LO resonance wavenumber for uncoupled LO
modes with or without dielectric background...
