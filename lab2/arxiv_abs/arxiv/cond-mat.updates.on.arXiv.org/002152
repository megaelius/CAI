The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is important for chiral domain walls
(DWs) and for stabilizing magnetic skyrmions. We study the effects of introducing increasing thicknesses
of Ir, from zero to 2 nm, into a Pt/Co/Ta multilayer between the Co and Ta. We observe a marked increase
in magnetic moment, due to the suppression of the dead layer at the interface with Ta, but the perpendicular
anisotropy is hardly affected. All samples show a universal scaling of the field-driven domain
wall velocity across the creep and depinning regimes. Asymmetric bubble expansion shows that DWs
in all of the samples have the left-handed N\'{e}el form. The value of in-plane field at which the
creep velocity shows a minimum drops markedly on the introduction of Ir, as does the frequency shift
of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks in Brillouin light scattering measurements. Despite this qualitative
similarity, there are quantitative differences in the DMI strength given by the two measurements,
with BLS often returning higher values. Many features in bubble expansion velocity curves do not
fit simple models commonly used to date, namely a lack of symmetry about the velocity minimum and
no difference in velocities at high in-plane field. These features are explained by the use of a model
in which the depinning field is allowed to vary with in-plane field in a way determined from micromagnetic
simulations. This theory shows that velocity minimum underestimates the DMI field, consistent
with BLS returning higher values. Our results suggest that the DMI at an Ir/Co interface has the same
sign as the DMI at a Pt/Co interface.
