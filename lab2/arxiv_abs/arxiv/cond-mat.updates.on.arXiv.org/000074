Non-local electrostatic interactions associated with the finite solvent size and ion polarizability
are investigated within the mean-field linear response theory. To this end, we introduce a field
theoretic model of a polar liquid composed of linear multipole solvent molecules and embedding
polarizable ions modeled as Drude oscillators. Unlike previous dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann formulations
treating the solvent molecules as point dipoles, our model is able to qualitatively reproduce the
non-local dielectric response behavior of polar liquids observed in Molecular Dynamics simulations
and Atomic Force Microscope experiments for water solvent at charged interfaces. The present theory
explains the formation of the associated interfacial hydration layers in terms of a cooperative
dipolar response mechanism driven by the reaction of the solvent molecules to their own polarization
field. We also incorporate into the theory the relative multipole/dipole moments of water molecules
obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, and show that the multipolar contributions to
the dielectric permittivity are largely dominated by the dipolar one. We find that this stems from
the mutual cancellation of the first two interfacial hydration layers of opposite net charge for
multipolar liquids. Within the same non-local dielectric response theory, we show that the induced
ion polarizability reverses the interfacial ion density trends predicted by the Poisson-Boltzmann
theory, resulting in a surface affinity of coions and exclusion of counterions. The results indicate
that the consideration of the discrete charge composition of solvent molecules and ions is the key
step towards a microscopic understanding of non-local electrostatic effects in polar solvents.
