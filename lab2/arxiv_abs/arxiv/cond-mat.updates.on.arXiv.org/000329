We study the stability of nucleated topological phases that can emerge when interacting non-Abelian
anyons form a regular array. The studies are carried out in the context of Kitaev's honeycomb model,
where we consider three distinct types of perturbations in the presence of a lattice of Majorana
mode binding vortices -- spatial anisotropy of the vortices, dimerization of the vortex lattice
and local random disorder. While all the nucleated phases are stable with respect to weak perturbations
of each kind, strong perturbations are found to result in very different behavior. Anisotropy of
the vortices stabilizes the strong-pairing like phases, while dimerization can recover the underlying
non-Abelian phase. Local random disorder, on the other hand, can drive all the nucleated phases
into a gapless thermal metal state. We show that all these distinct behavior can be captured by an
effective staggered tight-binding model for the Majorana modes. By studying the pairwise interactions
between the vortices, i.e. the amplitudes for the Majorana modes to tunnel between vortex cores,
the locations of phase transitions and the nature of the resulting states can be predicted. We also
find that due to oscillations in the Majorana tunneling amplitude, lattices of Majorana modes may
exhibit a Peierls-like instability, where a dimerized configuration is favored over a uniform
lattice. As the nature of the nucleated phases depends only on the Majorana tunneling, our results
apply also to other system supporting localized Majorana mode arrays, such as Abrikosov lattices
in p-wave superconductors, Wigner crystals in Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall states or arrays
of topological nanowires.
