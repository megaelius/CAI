Phase-change materials (PCMs), which are well-established in optical and random-access memories,
are increasingly studied for emerging topics such as brain-inspired computing and active photonics.
These applications take advantage of the pronounced reflectivity and resistivity changes that
accompany the structural transition in PCMs from their amorphous to crystalline state. However,
PCMs are typically fabricated as thin films via sputtering, which is costly, requires advanced
equipment, and limits the sample and device design. Here, we investigate a simpler and more flexi-ble
approach for applications in tunable photonics: the use of sub-10 nm colloidal PCM nanoparticles
(NPs). We report the optical properties of amorphous and crystalline germanium telluride (GeTe)
NP thin films from the infrared to the ultraviolet spectral range. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry
with support from cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and
absorption spectroscopy, we extract refractive indices n, extinction coefficients k, and band
gaps Eg and compare to values known for sputtered GeTe thin films. We find a decrease of n and k and an
increase of Eg for NP-based GeTe films, yielding insights into size-dependent property changes
for nanoscale PCMs. Furthermore, our results reveal the suitability of GeTe NPs for tunable photonics
in the near-infrared and visible spectral range. Finally, we studied sample reproducibility and
aging of our NP films. We found that the colloidally-prepared PCM thin films were stable for at least
two months stored under nitrogen, further supporting the great promise of these materials in applications.
