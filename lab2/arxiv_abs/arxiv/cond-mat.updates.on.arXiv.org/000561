In recent years, two-dimensional materials have attracted great attention.New two-dimensional
materials have been predicted, discovered, and studied. Two-dimensional materials demonstrate
novel physical properties, and the study of these materials is of great importance. In this paper,
we predict a new family of two-dimensional material based on the idea of octet stability: honeycomb
monolayer of nitrogen group elements. From first-principle calculations, we prove the existence
of two-dimensional structure of all these elements, and vibration frequencies suggest the stability
of these structures. In particular, nitrogen monolayer has never been studied before. The electronic
structures of these materials havealso been intensively studied.The effect of spin-orbit coupling
on the band structure has also been investigated.Based on analysis of projected density of states,
we argue that the s and p orbitals together are sufficient to describe the electronic structure.
A tight-binding modelwith spin-orbit coupling using only s and p orbitals that is applicable to
all these materialsis constructed, and the parameters are obtained by fitting the band structures
to first-principle results. From these parameters, spin-orbit coupling is found to be mainly consisted
of on-site term.We also study the electronic structure of both zigzag and armchair nano-ribbons,
and spin-polarized ferromagnetic edge states are found in some cases.The existence of ferromagnetic
edge statesis in contradiction with current convention the one-dimensional systems seldom demonstrate
ferromagnetism.Our study aims contribute to the study of low-dimensional materials.
