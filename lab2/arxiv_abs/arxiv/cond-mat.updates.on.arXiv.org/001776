Cold atoms with laser-induced spin-orbit (SO) interactions provide promising platforms to explore
novel quantum physics, in particular the exotic topological phases, beyond natural conditions
of solids. The past several years have witnessed important progresses in both theory and experiment
in the study of SO coupling and novel quantum states for ultracold atoms. Here we review the physics
of the SO coupled quantum gases, focusing on the latest theoretical and experimental progresses
of realizing SO couplings beyond one-dimension (1D), and the further investigation of novel topological
quantum phases in such systems, including the topological insulating phases and topological superfluids.
A pedagogical introduction to the SO coupling for ultracold atoms and topological quantum phases
is presented. We show that the so-called optical Raman lattice schemes, which combine the creation
of the conventional optical lattice and Raman lattice with topological stability, can provide
minimal methods with high experimental feasibility to realize 1D to 3D SO couplings. The optical
Raman lattices exhibit novel intrinsic symmetries, which enable the natural realization of topological
phases belonging to different symmetry classes, with the topology being detectable through minimal
measurement strategies. We introduce how the non-Abelian Majorana modes emerge in the SO coupled
superfluid phases which can be topologically nontrivial or trivial, for which a few fundamental
theorems are presented and discussed. The experimental schemes for achieving non-Abelian superfluid
phases are given. Finally, we point out the future important issues in this rapidly growing research
field.
