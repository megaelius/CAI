Superconductors have been being applied to a variety of large-scale power applications, including
magnets, electric machines, and fault current limiters, because they can enable a compact, lightweight
and high efficiency design. In applications such those mentioned above, superconducting coils
are always a key component. For example, in a superconducting electric machine, the superconducting
coils are used to generate the main flux density in the air gap, which is significantly important
for the energy conversion. It is the performance of the superconducting coils that plays an essential
role in determining the performance of the device. However, the performance of a superconducting
coil is limited by its critical current, which is determined by temperature and the magnitude and
orientation of the magnetic field inside the superconductors. Hence, in-depth investigations
to estimate the critical current of the superconducting coils are necessary before manufacturing.
Available transient simulation models to estimate the critical current are through the H- and T-A
formulations of Maxwell's equations. Both methods consider the same current ramp-up process occurring
in experiments. Besides these transient models, static simulations can also be used: a modified
load-line method and the so-called P-model, which is based on the asymptotic limit of Faraday's
equation when time approaches infinity. To find the best way to calculate the critical current,
the four methods are used to estimate the critical current of a double pancake superconducting coils
and results are compared with experiments. As a conclusion, T-A formulation, P-model, and the modified
load-line methods are recommended for estimating the critical current of the superconducting
coils.
