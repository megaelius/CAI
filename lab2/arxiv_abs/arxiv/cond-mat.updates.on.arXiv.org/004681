The discovery of stable room temperature ferroelectricity in Croconic Acid, an organic ferroelectric
material, with polarization values on par with those found in inorganic ferroelectric materials
and highest among organic ferroelectric materials, has opened up possibilities to realize myriads
of nano-electronic and spintronic devices based on organic ferroelectrics. Such possibilities
require an adequate understanding of the ferroelectric properties of Croconic Acid grown on surfaces
that are commonly employed in device fabrication. While several macroscopic studies on relatively
larger crystals of Croconic Acid have been performed, studies on thin films are only in their early
stages. We have grown thin films of Croconic Acid on gold and cobalt surfaces, which are commonly
used in spintronic devices as metallic electrodes, and studied the ferroelectric response of the
films using ex-situ Piezoresponse Force Microscopy at room temperature. We show that the polarization
reversal in Croconic Acid domains is sensitive to the substrate surface. Using the same experimental
protocol, we observe the robust polarization reversal of a single, mostly in-plane electrical
domain for a cobalt substrate, whereas polarization reversal is hardly observed for a gold substrate.
We attribute this difference to the influence of substrates on the Croconic Acid molecular networks.
Our study suggests that to realize devices one has to take care about the substrate on which Croconic
Acid will be deposited. The fact that polarization switching is robust on cobalt surface can be used
to fabricate multifunctional devices that utilize the cobalt-Croconic Acid interface.
