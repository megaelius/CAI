Zero dimensional perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has attracted considerable attention recently not only
because of its highly efficient green photoluminescence (PL), but also its two highly debated opposing
mechanisms of the luminescence: embedded CsPbBr3 nanocrystals versus intrinsic Br vacancy states.
After a brief discussion on the root cause of the controversy, we provide sensitive but non-invasive
methods that can not only directly correlate luminescence with the underlying structure, but also
distinguish point defects from embedded nanostructures. We first synthesized both emissive and
non-emissive Cs4PbBr6 crystals, obtained the complete Raman spectrum of Cs4PbBr6 and assigned
all Raman bands based on density functional theory simulations. We then used correlated Raman-PL
as a passive structure-property method to identify the difference between emissive and non-emissive
Cs4PbBr6 crystals and revealed the existence of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in emissive Cs4PbBr6. We
finally employed a diamond anvil cell to probe the response of luminescence centers to hydrostatic
pressure. The observations of fast red-shifting, diminishing and eventual disappearance of both
green emission and Raman below Cs4PbBr6 phase transition pressure of ~3 GPa is compatible with CsPbBr3
nanocrystal inclusions as green PL emitters and cannot be explained by Br vacancies. The resolution
of this long-lasting controversy paves the way for further device applications of low dimensional
perovskites, and our comprehensive optical technique integrating structure-property with dynamic
pressure response is generic and can be applied to other emerging optical materials to understand
the nature of their luminescent centers.
