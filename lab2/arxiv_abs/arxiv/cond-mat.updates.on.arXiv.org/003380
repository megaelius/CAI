A finite Schottky barrier and large contact resistance between monolayer MoS2 and electrodes are
the major bottlenecks in developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) that hinder
the study of intrinsic quantum behaviors such as valley-spin transport at low temperature. A gate-tunable
graphene electrode platform has been developed to improve the performance of MoS2 FETs. However,
intrinsic misalignment between the work function of pristine graphene and the conduction band
of MoS2 results in a large threshold voltage for the FETs, because of which Ohmic contact behaviors
are observed only at very high gate voltages and carrier concentrations (~1013 cm-2). Here, we present
high-performance monolayer MoS2 FETs with Ohmic contact at a modest gate voltage by using a chemical-vapor-deposited
(CVD) nitrogen-doped graphene with a high intrinsic electron carrier density. The CVD nitrogen-doped
graphene and monolayer MoS2 hybrid FETs platform exhibited a large negative shifted threshold
voltage of -54.2 V and barrier-free Ohmic contact under zero gate voltage. Transparent contact
by nitrogen-doped graphene led to a 214% enhancement in the on-current and a four-fold improvement
in the field-effect carrier mobility of monolayer MoS2 FETs compared with those of a pristine graphene
electrode platform. The transport measurements, as well as Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
analyses before and after thermal annealing, reveal that the atomic C-N bonding in the CVD nitrogen-doped
graphene is responsible for the dominant effects of electron doping. Large-scale nitrogen-doped
graphene electrodes provide a promising device platform for the development of high-performance
devices and the study of unique quantum behaviors.
