The coherent quantum effect becomes increasingly important in the heat dissipation bottleneck
of semiconductor nanoelectronics with the characteristic size shrinking down to few nano-meters
scale nowadays. However, the quantum mechanical model remains elusive for anharmonic phonon-phonon
scattering in extremely small nanostructures with broken translational symmetry. It is a long-term
challenging task to correctly simulate quantum heat transport including anharmonic scattering
at a scale relevant to practical applications. In this article, we present a clarified theoretical
formulation of anharmonic phonon non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) formalism for both 1D
and 3D nanostructures, through a diagrammatic perturbation expansion and an introduction of Fourier
representation to both harmonic and anharmonic terms. A parallelized computational framework
with first-principle force constants input is developed for large-scale quantum heat transport
simulation. Some crucial approximations in numerical implementation are investigated to ensure
the balance between numerical accuracy and efficiency. A quantitative validation is demonstrated
for the anharmonic phonon NEGF formalism and computational framework by modeling cross-plane
heat transport through silicon thin film. The phonon-phonon scattering is shown to be appreciable
and to introduce about 20% reduction of thermal conductivity at room temperature even for a film
thickness around 10 nm. The present methodology provides a robust platform for the device quantum
thermal modeling, as well as the study on the transition from coherent to incoherent heat transport
in nano-phononic crystals. This work thus paves the way to understand and to manipulate heat conduction
via the wave nature of phonons.
