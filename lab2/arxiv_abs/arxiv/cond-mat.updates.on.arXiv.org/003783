We investigate the non-linear response and energy absorption in bulk silicon irradiated by intense
12fs near-infrared laser pulses. Depending on the laser intensity, we distinguish two regimes
of non-linear absorption of the laser energy: for low intensities, energy deposition and photoionization
involve perturbative three-photon transition through the direct bandgap of silicon. For laser
intensities near and above $10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$, corresponding to photocarrier density of order
10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$, we find that absorption at near-infrared wavelengths is greatly enhanced
due to excitation of bulk plasmon resonance. In this regime, the energy deposited onto electrons
exceeds a few times the thermal melting threshold of Si. The optical reflectivity of the photoexcited
solid is found in good qualitative agreement with existing experimental data. In particular, the
model predicts that the main features of the reflectivity curve of photoexcited Si as a function
of the laser fluence, are due to state and band filling effects associated with Pauli blocking rather
than Drude free-electron response. The non-linear response of the photoexcited solid is investigated
for irradiation with a sequence of two strong and temporary non-overlapping pulses. We find that
the cummulative effect of the two pulses is non-additive in terms of deposited energy. More specifically,
and depending sensitiviely on the pump laser intensity, photoionization and energy absorption
on the rising edge of the second pulse is enhanced due to superposition of the electric fields of bulk
plasmon and the laser. When increasing the intensity above this threshold, the electric field of
the second pulse is screened out and most of its energy is reflected away.
