Using detailed atomistic simulations,we explore the conformational landscape of aggregates
formed by biomimetic antimicrobial(AM) binary methacrylate copolymers,with hydrophobic and
charged functional groups and the role of inclusion of polar functional groups on such aggregate
morphologies.The effect of sequence of the constituent functional groups on aggregate conformation
is also studied by considering random and block sequences along the polymer backbone.Our results
suggest that block binary copolymers form large spherical aggregates with effective shielding
of hydrophobic groups by charged groups.In contrast, random binary copolymers tend to form more
bundle-like structures with exposed hydrophobic groups.The strong aggregation of binary polymers
is driven primarily by attractive interactions between hydrophobic groups.However,replacing
some of the hydrophobic groups with overall charge neutral polar groups weakens the aggregate considerably,
leading to increased conformational fluctuations and formation of loose-packed,open aggregates,particularly
in case of random ternary polymers.Interaction energy calculations strongly suggest that the
role of inclusion of polar groups is two-fold: (1)to reduce possible strong local concentration
of hydrophobic groups and smear the hydrophobicity along the polymer backbone to increase the solubility
of the polymers (2)to compensate the loss of attractive hydrophobic interactions by forming attractive
electrostatic interactions with charged groups and contribute to aggregation formation,albeit
weak.Given that most of the naturally occurring AM peptides have contributions from all the three
functional groups,this study elucidates the functionally tuneable role of inclusion of polar
groups in the way AM agents interact with each other in solution phase,which can eventually dictate
their partitioning behavior into bacterial and mammalian membranes.
