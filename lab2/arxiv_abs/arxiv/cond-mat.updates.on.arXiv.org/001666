Spontaneous synchronization is a remarkable collective effect observed in nature, whereby a population
of oscillating units, which have diverse natural frequencies and are in weak interaction with one
another, evolves to spontaneously exhibit collective oscillations at a common frequency. The
Kuramoto model provides the basic analytical framework to study spontaneous synchronization.
The model comprises limit-cycle oscillators with distributed natural frequencies interacting
through a mean-field coupling. Although more than forty years have passed since its introduction,
the model continues to occupy the centre-stage of research in the field of non-linear dynamics,
and is also widely applied to model diverse physical situations. In this brief review, starting
with a derivation of the Kuramoto model and the synchronization phenomenon it exhibits, we summarize
recent results on the study of a generalized Kuramoto model that includes inertial effects and stochastic
noise. We describe the dynamics of the generalized model from a different yet a rather useful perspective,
namely, that of long-range interacting systems driven out of equilibrium by quenched disordered
external torques. A system is said to be long-range interacting if the inter-particle potential
decays slowly as a function of distance. Using tools of statistical physics, we highlight the equilibrium
and nonequilibrium aspects of the dynamics of the generalized Kuramoto model, and uncover a rather
rich and complex phase diagram that it exhibits, which underlines the basic theme of intriguing
emergent phenomena that are exhibited by many-body complex systems.
