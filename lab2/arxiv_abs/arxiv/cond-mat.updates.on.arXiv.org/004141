A consistent microscopic theory of pseudogap phenomena and novel Bose-liquid superconductivity
(superfluidity) is presented, based on the fact that in high-$T_c$ cuprates and related systems
the energy $\varepsilon_A$ of the effective attraction between fermions is comparable with their
Fermi energy $\varepsilon_F$ and the bosonic Cooper pairs are formed above $T_c$ and then a part
of such Cooper pairs condense into a Bose superfluid at $T_c$. High-$T_c$ cuprates and other systems
with low Fermi energies ($\varepsilon_F\sim\varepsilon_A$) are bosonic superconductors/superfluids
and exhibit pseudogap phases above $T_c$, $\lambda$-like superconducting transition at $T_c$
and Bose-liquid superconductivity below $T_c$. The relevant charge carriers in high-$T_c$ cuprates
are polarons which are bound into bosonic Cooper pairs above $T_c$. Polaronic and pseudogap effects
weaken with increasing the doping and disappear at a quantum critical point. The modified BCS-like
theory describes another pseudogap regime but the superfluid transition in high-$T_c$ cuprates
and other systems is neither BCS-like transition nor usual Bose-Einstein condensation. The criteria
for bosonization of Cooper pairs are formulated. The mean-field theory of the coherent single particle
and pair condensates of bosonic Cooper pairs describes fairly well the novel superconducting states
and properties of high-$T_c$ cuprates in full agreement with the experimental findings. The unusual
superconducting/superfluid states and properties of other exotic systems (e.g., heavy-fermion
and organic compounds, $\rm{Sr_2RuO_4}$, $^3$He, $^4$He and atomic Fermi gases) are explained
more clearly by the theory of Bose superfluids. Finally, the new criteria and principles of unconventional
superconductivity and superfluidity are formulated.
