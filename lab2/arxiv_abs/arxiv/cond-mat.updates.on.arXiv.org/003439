Flow-induced failure of granular materials is relevant to a broad range of geomechanical applications.
Plasticity, which is the inherent failure mechanism of most granular materials, enables large
deformations that can invalidate linearised models. Here, we study the problem of fluid-driven
deformation around a borehole by developing a large-deformation model for radially outward fluid
injection from a cylindrical cavity into a 'partially permeable' elastic--perfectly-plastic
cohesive granular material. To account for the pre-existing stresses in the subsurface, we calculate
the disturbance due to fluid injection by subtracting a compressed initial state from our solutions.
We also introduce a simple parameter that allows for a smooth transition from an impermeable material
(i.e., subject to mechanical loading at the borehole wall) to a fully permeable material (i.e.,
subject to an internal pore-pressure gradient). This allows coated boreholes and very-low-permeability
materials to be modelled as 'partially permeable', which may be more representative of their true
behaviour. We focus on the difference between poroelastic and poroelasto-plastic deformations,
the role of kinematic and constitutive nonlinearity, and the transition from impermeable to fully
permeable. We find that plasticity can enable much larger deformations while predicting much smaller
stresses. The former makes model choice increasingly important in the plastic region, while the
elastic region remains insensitive to these changes. We also find that, for a fixed total stress
at the borehole wall, materials experience larger deformations and generally larger stresses
as they transition from impermeable to fully permeable.
