Quantum supremacy is the ability of quantum processors to outperform classical computers at certain
tasks. In digital random quantum circuit approaches for supremacy, the output distribution produced
is described by the Porter-Thomas (PT) distribution. In this regime, the system uniformly explores
its entire Hilbert space, which makes simulating such quantum dynamics with classical computational
resources impossible for large systems. However, the latter has no direct application so far in
solving a specific problem. In this work, we show that the same sampling complexity can be achieved
from driven analog quantum processors, with less stringent requirements for coherence and control.
More importantly, we discuss how to apply this approach to solve problems in quantum simulations
of phases of matter and machine learning. Specifically, we consider a simple quantum spin chain
with nearest-neighbor interactions driven by a global magnetic field. We show how quantum supremacy
is achieved as a consequence of the thermalization due to the interplay between the disorder and
the driven many-body dynamics. We analyze how the achieved PT distribution can be used as an accessible
reference distribution to probe the many-body localization (MBL) phase transition. In the second
part of our work, we show how our setup can be used for generative modeling machine learning tasks.
We propose a novel variational hybrid quantum-classical approach, exploiting the system's inherent
tunable MBL dynamics, to train the device to learn distributions of complex classical data. The
performance of our training protocol depends solely on the phase that the quantum system is in, which
makes fine-tuning of local parameters not necessary. The protocol is implementable in a range of
driven quantum many-body systems, compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.
