The tensor network representation of many-body quantum states, given by local tensors, provides
a promising numerical tool for the study of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimension.
However, tensor network representations may be vulnerable to instabilities caused by small perturbations
of the local tensor, especially when the local tensor is not injective. For example, the topological
order in tensor network representations of the toric code ground state has been shown to be unstable
under certain small variations of the local tensor, if these small variations do not obey a local
$Z_2$ symmetry of the tensor. In this paper, we ask the questions of whether other types of topological
orders suffer from similar kinds of instability and if so, what is the underlying physical mechanism
and whether we can protect the order by enforcing certain symmetries on the tensor. We answer these
questions by showing that the tensor network representation of all string-net models are indeed
unstable, but the matrix product operator (MPO) symmetries of the local tensor can help to protect
the order. We find that, `stand-alone' variations that break the MPO symmetries lead to instability
because they induce the condensation of bosonic quasi-particles and destroy the topological order
in the system. Therefore, such variations must be forbidden for the encoded topological order to
be reliably extracted from the local tensor. On the other hand, if a tensor network based variational
algorithm is used to simulate the phase transition due to boson condensation, then such variation
directions must be allowed in order to access the continuous phase transition process correctly.
