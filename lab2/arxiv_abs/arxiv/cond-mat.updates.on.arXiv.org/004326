Organisms often use cyclic changes in the concentrations of chemicals species to precisely time
biological functions. Underlying these biochemical clocks are chemical reactions and transport
processes, which are inherently stochastic. Understanding the physical basis for robust biochemical
oscillations in the presence of fluctuations has thus emerged as an important problem. In a previous
paper [C. del Junco and S. Vaikuntanathan, Phys. Rev. E 101, 012410 (2020)], we explored this question
using the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of single-ring Markov state models of biochemical
networks that support oscillations. Our finding was that they can exploit non-equilibrium driving
to robustly maintain the period and coherence of oscillations in the presence of randomness in the
rates. Here, we extend our work to Markov state models consisting of a large cycle decorated with
multiple small cycles. These additional cycles are intended to represent alternate pathways that
the oscillator may take as it fluctuates about its average path. Combining a mapping to single-cycle
networks based on first passage time distributions with our previously developed theory, we are
able to make analytical predictions for the period and coherence of oscillations in these networks.
One implication of our predictions is that a high energy budget can make different network topologies
and arrangements of rates degenerate as far as the period and coherence of oscillations is concerned.
Excellent agreement between analytical and numerical results confirms that this is the case. Our
results suggest that biochemical oscillators can be more robust to fluctuations in the path of the
oscillator when they have a high energy budget.
