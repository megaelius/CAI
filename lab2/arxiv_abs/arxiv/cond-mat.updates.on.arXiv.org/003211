Weakly attractive interactions between the tips of rod-like colloidal particles affect their
liquid-crystal phase behaviour due to a subtle interplay between enthalpy and entropy. Here, we
employ molecular dynamics simulations on semi-flexible, repulsive bead-spring chains of which
one of the two end beads attract each other. We calculate the phase diagram as a function of both the
volume fraction of the chains and the strength of the attractive potential. We identify a large number
of phases that include isotropic, nematic, smectic A, smectic B and crystalline states. For tip
attraction energies lower than the thermal energy, our results are qualitatively consistent with
experimental findings: we find that an increase of the attraction strength shifts the nematic to
smectic A phase transition to lower volume fractions, with only minor effect on the stability of
the other phases. For sufficiently strong tip attraction, the nematic phase disappears completely,
in addition leading to the destabilisation of the isotropic phase. In order to better understand
the underlying physics of these phenomena, we also investigate the clustering of the particles
at their attractive tips and the effective molecular field experienced by the particles in the smectic
A phase. Based on these results, we argue that the clustering of the tips only affects the phase stability
if lamellar structures (``micelles'') are formed. We find that an increase of the attraction strength
increases the degree of order in the layered phases.Interestingly, we also find evidence for the
existence of an anti-ferroelectric smectic A phase transition induced by the interaction between
the tips. A simple Maier-Saupe-McMillan model confirms our findings.
