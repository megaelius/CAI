Impurities are unavoidable during the preparation of graphene samples and play an important role
in graphene's electronic properties when they are adsorbed on graphene surface. In this work, we
study the electronic structures and transport properties of a two-terminal zigzag graphene nanoribbon
(ZGNR) device whose scattering region is covered by various adsorbates within the framework of
the tight-binding approximation, by taking into account the coupling strength $\gamma$ between
adsorbates and carbon atoms, the adsorbate concentration $n_i$, and the on-site energy disorder
of adsorbates. Our results indicate that when the scattering region is fully covered by homogeneous
adsorbates, i.e., $n_i=1$, a transmission gap opens around the Dirac point and its width is almost
proportional to $\gamma^2$. In particular, two conductance plateaus of $G=2e^2/h$ appear in the
vicinity of the electron energy $E=\pm \gamma$. When the scattering region is partially covered
by homogeneous adsorbates ($0<n_i<1$), the transmission gap still survives around the Dirac point
even at low $n_i$, and its width is firstly increased by $n_i$ and then declined by further increasing
$n_i$; whereas the conductance decreases with $n_i$ in the regime of low $n_i$ and increases with
$n_i$ in the regime of high $n_i$. While in the presence of disordered adsorbates whose on-site energies
are random variables characterized by the disorder degree, the transmission gap disappears at
low $n_i$ and reappears at relatively high $n_i$. Furthermore, the transmission ability of the
ZGNR device can be enhanced by the adsorbate disorder when the disorder degree surpasses a critical
value, contrary to the localization picture that the conduction of a nanowire becomes poorer with
increasing the disorder degree. The physics underlying these transport characteristics is discussed.
Our results are in good agreement with experiments.
