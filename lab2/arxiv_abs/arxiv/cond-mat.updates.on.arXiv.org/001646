The quantum Hall effect (QHE) in two-dimensional (2D) electron gases, which is one of the most striking
phenomena in condensed matter physics, involves the topologically protected dissipationless
charge current flow along the edges of the sample. Integer or fractional electrical conductance
are measured in units of $e^2/2\pi\hbar$, which is associated with edge currents of electrons or
quasiparticles with fractional charges, respectively. Here we discover a novel type of quantization
of the Hall effect in an insulating 2D quantum magnet. In $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with dominant Kitaev
interaction on 2D honeycomb lattice, the application of a parallel magnetic field destroys the
long-range magnetic order, leading to a field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state with
massive entanglement of local spins. In the low-temperature regime of the QSL state, we report that
the 2D thermal Hall conductance $\kappa_{xy}^{2D}$ reaches a quantum plateau as a function of applied
magnetic field. $\kappa_{xy}^{2D}/T$ attains a quantization value of $(\pi/12)(k_B^2/\hbar)$,
which is exactly half of $\kappa_{xy}^{2D}/T$ in the integer QHE. This half-integer thermal Hall
conductance observed in a bulk material is a direct signature of topologically protected chiral
edge currents of charge neutral Majorana fermions, particles that are their own antiparticles,
which possess half degrees of freedom of conventional fermions. These signatures demonstrate
the fractionalization of spins into itinerant Majorana fermions and $Z_2$ fluxes predicted in
a Kitaev QSL. Above a critical magnetic field, the quantization disappears and $\kappa_{xy}^{2D}/T$
goes to zero rapidly, indicating a topological quantum phase transition between the states with
and without chiral Majorana edge modes. Emergent Majorana fermions in a quantum magnet are expected
to have a major impact on strongly correlated topological quantum matter.
