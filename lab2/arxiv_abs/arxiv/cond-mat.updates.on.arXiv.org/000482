We present a detailed investigation of the hole (3\% Re) doping effect on the polycrystalline CeRu$_{2}$Al$_{10}$
sample by magnetization, heat capacity, resistivity, muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), and neutron
scattering (both elastic and inelastic) measurements. CeRu$_2$Al$_{10}$ is an exceptional cerium
compound with an unusually high Neel temperature of 27 K. Here we study the stability of the unusual
magnetic order by means of controlled doping, and we uncover further surprising attributes of this
phase transition. The heat capacity, resistivity and $\mu$SR measurements reveal an onset of magnetic
ordering below 23 K, while a broad peak at 31 K (i.e. above $T_N$), has been observed in the temperature
dependent susceptibility, indicating an opening of a spin gap above $T_N$. Our important finding,
from the neutron diffraction, is that the compound orders antiferromagnetically with a propagation
vector $\bf k$ = (1 0 0) and the ordered state moment is 0.20(1)$\mu_B$ along the $b-$axis. This is
in sharp contrast to the undoped compound, which shows AFM ordering at 27 K with the ordered moment
of 0.39(3)$\mu_B$ along the $c-$axis. Similar to CeRu$_2$Al$_{10}$ our inelastic neutron scattering
study on the Re doped shows a sharp spin gap-type excitation near 8 meV at 5 K, but with slightly reduced
intensity compared to the undoped compound. Further the excitation broadens and shifts to lower
energy ($\le$ 4 meV) near 35 K. These results suggest that the low temperature magnetic properties
of the hole doped sample is governed by the competition between the anisotropic hybridization effect
and crystal field anisotropy as observed in hole-doped CeOs$_2$Al$_{10}$.
