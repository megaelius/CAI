We develop an alternative time-dependent numerical renormalization group formalism (TDNRG)
for multiple quenches and implement it to study the response of a quantum impurity system to a general
pulse. Within this approach, we reduce the contribution of the NRG approximation to numerical errors
in the time evolution of observables by a formulation that uses the difference of eigenvalues instead
of their absolute values, as in our previous multiple-quench TDNRG formalism [Nghiem {\em et al.,}
Phys. Rev. B {\bf 89}, 075118 (2014); Phys. Rev. B {\bf 90}, 035129 (2014)]. We demonstrate that the
new formalism yields a smaller cumulative error in the trace of the projected density matrix as a
function of time and a smaller discontinuity of local observables between quenches than in our previous
approach [Nghiem {\em et al.,} Phys. Rev. B {\bf 90}, 035129 (2014)]. Moreover, by increasing the
switch-on time, the time between the first and last quench of the discretized pulse, the long time
limit of observables systematically converges to its expected value in the final state, i.e., the
more adiabatic the switching, the more accurately is the long time limit recovered. The present
formalism can be straightforwardly extended to infinite switch-on times. We show that this yields
highly accurate results for the long time limit of both thermodynamic observables and spectral
functions, and overcomes the significant errors within the single quench formalism [Anders {\em
et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95}, 196801 (2005); Nghiem {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 119},
156601 (2017)]. This improvement provides a first step towards an accurate description of nonequilibrium
steady states of quantum impurity systems, e.g., within the scattering states NRG approach [Anders,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 066804 (2008)].
