A new, evidence based theoretical approach to macroscopic quantum coherence and superconductivity
at high temperatures is proposed. The theory includes mechanisms to address e-pair coupling in
the superconducting and pseudogap phases and their inter relations observed in antiferromagnetic
cuprates. Electron pair coupling in the superconducting phase is facilitated by local quantum
potentials created by static dopants, with a computed shape and size confirmed by independent expermental
data. Our interpretation aligns very precisely with experimentally observed optimal doping levels
and the peak in critical temperature, which correlates with the theoretically predicted maximum
number of bound e-pairs. By contrast, electrons in the pseudogap are coupled by fractal spin waves
(fractons) induced by the fractal arrangement of dopants. On another level, the theory offers new
insights into the emergence of a macroscopic quantum potential generated by fractal spin waves,
which has two key effects. The first involves the transition of an expected diffusive process (normally
associated with Anderson localization) in fractal networks, into quantum coherence. The second
involves the facilitation of tunneling between localized electron pairs, leading to the merger
of the super conducting and pseudo gap phases into a single, coherent condensate at optimal doping.
The underlying theory relating to the diffusion to quantum transition is supported by Random Coherent
Lasing, which can be explained using an analogous approach. As a final step, an experimental program
is outlined to validate the theory and suggests a new approach to increase the stability of electron
pair condensates at higher temperatures.
