We consider a fermionic system for which there exist a single-reference Configuration-Interaction
(CI) expansion of the ground state wave function that converges, albeit not necessarily rapidly,
with respect to excitation number. We show that, if the coefficients of Slater determinants (SD)
with $l\leq k$ excitations can be defined with a number of free parameters $N_{\leq k}$ bounded polynomially
in $k$, the ground state energy $E$ only depends on a small fraction of all the wave function parameters,
and is the solution of equations of the Coupled Cluster (CC) form. This generalizes the standard
CC method, for which $N_{\leq k}$ is bounded by a constant. Based on that result and low-rank tensor
decompositions (LRTD), we discuss two possible extensions of the CC approach for wave functions
with general polynomial bound for $N_{\leq k}$. First, one can use LRTD to represent the amplitudes
of the CC cluster operator $T$ which, unlike in the CC case, is not truncated with respect to excitation
number, and the energy and tensor parameters are given by a LRTD-adapted version of standard CC equations.
Second, the LRTD can also be used to directly parametrize the CI coefficients, which involves different
equations of the CC form. We derive those equations for up to quadruple-excitation coefficients,
using a different type of excitation operator in the CC wave function ans\"atz, and a Hamiltonian
representation in terms of excited particle and hole operators. We complete the proposed CC extensions
by constructing compact tensor representations of coefficients, or $T$-amplitudes, using superpositions
of tree tensor networks which take into account different possible types of entanglement between
excited particles and holes. Finally, we discuss why the proposed extensions are theoretically
applicable at larger coupling strengths than those treatable by the standard CC method.
