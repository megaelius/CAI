Hexagonal La$_2$Ni$_7$ and rhombohedral Y$_2$Ni$_7$ are weak itinerant antiferromagnet (wAFM)
and ferromagnet (wFM), respectively. To follow the evolution between these two compounds, the
crystal structure and magnetic properties of $A_2B_7$ intermetallic compounds ($A$ = La, Y, $B$
= Ni) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. In
the present study, the La$_{2-x}$Y$_x$Ni$_7$ intermetallic compounds with $0 \leq x \leq 1$ crystallize
in the hexagonal structure (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_7$-type) with Y preferentially located in the [$AB_2$]
units. The compounds with larger Y content ($1.2 \leq x < 2$) crystallize in both hexagonal and rhombohedral
(Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type) structures with a progressive substitution of Y for La in the $A$ sites belonging
to the [$AB_5$] units. Y$_2$Ni$_7$ crystallizes in the rhombohedral structure only. The average
cell volume decreases linearly versus Y content, whereas the c/a ratio presents a minimum at $x =
1$ due to geometric constrains. The magnetic properties are strongly dependent on the structure
type and the Y content. For $x \leq 1$, the magnetic order oscillates between wAFM and wFM depending
on the Y content and applied magnetic field. All the compounds with $x > 1$ are wFM with $T_C$ = 55 K.
In addition to the experimental studies, first principles calculations using spin polarization
have been performed to interpret the evolution of both structural phase stability and magnetic
ordering for $0 \leq x < 2$. Magnetic instability is related to the presence of a sharp and narrow peak
in the density of state near the Fermi level. A stable AFM structure has been found for hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_7$.
It explains how the magnetic order is driven by the geometric constrains induced by the stacking
of [$AB_2$] and [$AB_5$] layers.
