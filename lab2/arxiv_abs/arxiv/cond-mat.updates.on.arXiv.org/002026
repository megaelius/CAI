Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to understand the variations in deformation
mechanisms of Cu nanowires as a function of orientation and loading mode (tension or compression).
Cu nanowires of different crystallographic orientations distributed uniformly on the standard
stereographic triangle have been considered under tensile and compressive loading. The simulation
results indicate that under compressive loading, the orientations close to $<$100$>$ corner deform
by twinning mechanism, while the remaining orientations deform by dislocation slip. On the other
hand, all the nanowires deform by twinning mechanism under tensile loading. Further, the orientations
close to $<$110$>$ and $<$111$>$ corner exhibit tension-compression asymmetry in deformation
mechanisms. In addition to deformation mechanisms, Cu nanowires also display tension-compression
asymmetry in yield stress. The orientations close to $<$001$>$ corner exhibits higher yield stress
in tension than in compression, while the opposite behaviour (higher yield stress in compression
than in tension) has been observed in orientations close to $<$110$>$ and $<$111$>$ corners. For
the specific orientation of $<$102$>$, the yield stress asymmetry has not been observed. The tension-compression
asymmetry in deformation mechanisms has been explained based on the parameter $\alpha_M$, defined
as the ratio of Schmid factors for leading and trailing partial dislocations. Similarly, the asymmetry
in yield stress values has been attributed to the different Schmid factor values for leading partial
dislocations under tensile and compressive loading.
