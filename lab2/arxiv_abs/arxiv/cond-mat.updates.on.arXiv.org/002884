We study experimentally a sediment of self-propelled Brownian particles with densities ranging
from dilute to ergodic supercooled to nonergodic glass. We observe a dramatic slowdown of relaxation
of nonergodic states when particles become weakly self-propelled. By contrast, ergodic supercooled
states always relax faster with self-propulsion. Our system is a monolayer of micron-size gold-platinum
Janus particles, which become active upon adding a solution of hydrogen peroxide due to self-phoretic
propulsion mechanisms. We characterise the activity level in our system with an effective temperature
defined from the density profile. Standard glassy physics describes well the ergodic regime provided
the replacement of the ambient temperature by this effective temperature: higher temperature
implies faster relaxation. However beyond the glass transition, the relaxation of the nonergodic
system abruptly slows down at low but nonzero activity. As we increase further activity, the relaxation
speeds up until it exceeds the passive situation. This nonmonotonic behavior cannot be described
by a simple increase in temperature. To explain this phenomenon, we correlated particle displacement
orientation and calculated the average length of correlated domains. It shows first a decrease
and then an increase with the effective temperature. In particular, the minimum correlated domain
length corresponds to the effective temperature where we detected the slowest relaxation. This
suggests that relaxation in sufficiently active glass follows collective motion mechanisms,
while cooperative motion dominates at zero and low activities. We propose that directed motion
makes cage exploration less efficient and thus slows down cooperative relaxation with respect
to a passive glass.
