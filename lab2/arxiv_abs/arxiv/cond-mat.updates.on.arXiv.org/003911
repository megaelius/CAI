Unraveling bacterial strategies for spatial exploration is crucial for understanding the complexity
in the organization of life. Bacterial motility determines the spatio-temporal structure of microbial
communities, controls infection spreading and the microbiota organization in guts or in soils.
Most theoretical approaches for modeling bacterial transport rely on their run-and-tumble motion.
For Escherichia coli, the run time distribution was reported to follow a Poisson process with a single
characteristic time related to the rotational switching of the flagellar motors. However, direct
measurements on flagellar motors show heavy-tailed distributions of rotation times stemming
from the intrinsic noise in the chemotactic mechanism. Currently, there is no direct experimental
evidence that the stochasticity in the chemotactic machinery affect the macroscopic motility
of bacteria. In stark contrast with the accepted vision of run-and-tumble, here we report a large
behavioral variability of wild-type \emph{E. coli}, revealed in their three-dimensional trajectories.
At short observation times, a large distribution of run times is measured on a population and attributed
to the slow fluctuations of a signaling protein triggering the flagellar motor reversal. Over long
times, individual bacteria undergo significant changes in motility. We demonstrate that such
a large distribution of run times introduces measurement biases in most practical situations.
Our results reconcile the notorious conundrum between run time observations and motor switching
statistics. We finally propose that statistical modeling of transport properties currently undertaken
in the emerging framework of active matter studies, should be reconsidered under the scope of this
large variability of motility features.
