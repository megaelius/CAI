Directional locking occurs when a particle moving over a periodic substrate becomes constrained
to travel along certain substrate symmetry directions. Such locking effects arise for colloids
and superconducting vortices moving over ordered substrates when the direction of the external
drive is varied. Here we study the directional locking of run-and-tumble active matter particles
interacting with a periodic array of obstacles. In the absence of an external biasing force, we find
that the active particle motion locks to various symmetry directions of the substrate when the run
time between tumbles is large. The number of possible locking directions depends on the array density
and on the relative sizes of the particles and the obstacles. For a square array of large obstacles,
the active particle only locks to the $x$, $y$, and $45^{\circ}$ directions, while for smaller obstacles,
the number of locking angles increases. Each locking angle satisfies $\theta = \arctan(p/q)$,
where $p$ and $q$ are integers, and the angle of motion can be measured using the ratio of the velocities
or the velocity distributions in the $x$ and $y$ directions. When a biasing driving force is applied,
the directional locking behavior is affected by the ratio of the self-propulsion force to the biasing
force. For large biasing, the behavior resembles that found for directional locking in passive
systems. For large obstacles under biased driving, a trapping behavior occurs that is non-monotonic
as a function of increasing run length or increasing self-propulsion force, and the trapping diminishes
when the run length is sufficiently large.
