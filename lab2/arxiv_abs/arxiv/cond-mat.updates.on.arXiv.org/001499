We show that a pair of overlapping Majorana bound states (MBSs) forming a partially-separated Andreev
bound state (ps-ABS) represents a generic low-energy feature in spin-orbit coupled semiconductor-superconductor
(SM-SC) hybrid nanowires in the presence of a Zeeman field. In a finite nanowire the ps-ABS interpolates
continuously between the "garden variety" ABS, which consists of two MBSs sitting on top of each
other, and the topologically protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which are separated by a distance
given by the length of the wire. Despite being topologically trivial, ps-ABSs can generate signatures
identical to MZMs in local charge tunneling experiments. In particular, the height of the zero bias
conductance peak (ZBCP) generated by ps-ABSs has the quantized value, 2e2/h, and it can remain unchanged
in an extended range of experimental parameters, such as Zeeman field and the tunnel barrier height.
We illustrate the formation of such low-energy robust ps-ABSs in two experimentally relevant situations:
a hybrid SM-SC system consisting of a proximitized nanowire coupled to a quantum dot and the SM-SC
system in the presence of a spatially varying inhomogeneous potential. We then show that, unlike
local measurements, a two-terminal experiment involving charge tunneling at both ends of the wire
is capable of distinguishing the non-Abelian MZMs from the generic ps-ABSs. While the MZMs localized
at the opposite ends of the wire generate correlated differential conduction spectra, including
correlations in energy splittings and critical Zeeman fields associated with the emergence of
the ZBCPs, such correlations are absent if the ZBCPs are due to ps-ABSs emerging in the topologically
trivial phase. Measuring such correlations is the clearest and most straightforward test of topological
MZMs in SM-SC heterostructures that can be done in a currently accessible experimental set-up.
