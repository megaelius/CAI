First-principles electronic structure calculations are very widely used thanks to the many successful
software packages available. Their traditional coding paradigm is monolithic, i.e., regardless
of how modular its internal structure may be, the code is built independently from others, from the
compiler up, with the exception of linear-algebra and message-passing libraries. This model has
been quite successful for decades. The rapid progress in methodology, however, has resulted in
an ever increasing complexity of those programs, which implies a growing amount of replication
in coding and in the recurrent re-engineering needed to adapt to evolving hardware architecture.
The Electronic Structure Library (\esl) was initiated by CECAM (European Centre for Atomic and
Molecular Calculations) to catalyze a paradigm shift away from the monolithic model and promote
modularization, with the ambition to extract common tasks from electronic structure programs
and redesign them as free, open-source libraries. They include ``heavy-duty'' ones with a high
degree of parallelisation, and potential for adaptation to novel hardware within them, thereby
separating the sophisticated computer science aspects of performance optimization and re-engineering
from the computational science done by scientists when implementing new ideas. It is a community
effort, undertaken by developers of various successful codes, now facing the challenges arising
in the new model. This modular paradigm will improve overall coding efficiency and enable specialists
(computer scientists or computational scientists) to use their skills more effectively. It will
lead to a more sustainable and dynamic evolution of software as well as lower barriers to entry for
new developers.
