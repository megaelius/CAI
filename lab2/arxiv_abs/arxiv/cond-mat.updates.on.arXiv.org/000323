We revisit our initial derivations of the exact 2-spinon $S_2$ and 4-spinon $S_4$ dynamical structure
factors (DSF). First we show that the latter derivations had normalization factors that are twice
and quadriple the correct ones respectively. This means that $S_2$ contributes not 72% as was previously
thought but 36% to the total DSF. We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$ to be between 18% and
20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans. In fact we show that the latter reference had
also the normalization factor twice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly
it would have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore, we prove that its
claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect in its dependency on the spectral parameters
is incorrect because fixing the momentun transfer $k$ up to $2\pi$ as the latter reference did to
justify its claim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will prove in
this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\pi$. Also in this paper we derive $S_n$ for general
$n$ by following a different approach compared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for
$S_4$ both the new derivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed
differently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and compact and also reveals
new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which substantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$
and its sum rules. Moreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation to
the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work might resolve the discrepancy
between the exact theoretic results and experiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.
