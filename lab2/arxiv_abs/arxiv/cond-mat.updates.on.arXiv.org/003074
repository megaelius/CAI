Arrays of ultra-cold dipolar gases loaded in optical lattices are emerging as powerful quantum
simulators of the many-body physics associated with the rich interplay between long-range dipolar
interactions, contact interactions, motion, and quantum statistics. In this work we report on
our investigation of the quantum many-body dynamics of a large ensemble of bosonic magnetic chromium
atoms with spin S = 3 in a three-dimensional lattice as a function of lattice depth. Using extensive
theory and experimental comparisons we study the dynamics of the population of the different Zeeman
levels and the total magnetization of the gas across the superfluid to the Mott insulator transition.
We are able to identify two distinct regimes: At low lattice depths, where atoms are in the superfluid
regime, we observe that the spin dynamics is strongly determined by the competition between particle
motion, onsite interactions and external magnetic field gradients. Contact spin dependent interactions
help to stabilize the collective spin length, which sets the total magnetization of the gas. On the
contrary, at high lattice depths, transport is largely frozen out. In this regime, while the spin
populations are mainly driven by long range dipolar interactions, magnetic field gradients also
play a major role in the total spin demagnetization. We find that dynamics at low lattice depth is
qualitatively reproduced by mean-field calculations based on the Gutzwiller ansatz; on the contrary,
only a beyond mean-field theory can account for the dynamics at large lattice depths. While the cross-over
between these two regimes does not correspond to sharp features in the observed dynamical evolution
of the spin components, our simulations indicate that it would be better revealed by measurements
of the collective spin length.
