Despite the large number of theoretical III-V semiconductor studies reported every year, our atomistic
understanding is still limited. The limitations of the theoretical approaches to yield accurate
structural and electronic properties on an equal footing, due to the unphysical self-interaction
problem that affects mainly the band gap and spin-orbit splitting (SOC) in semiconductors and,
in particular, III-V systems with similar magnitude of the band gap and SOC. In this work, we will
report a consistent study of the structural and electronic properties of the III-V semiconductors
employing the screening hybrid-DFT framework, fitting the $\alpha$ parameters for 12 different
III-V compounds, namely, AlN, AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InN, InP, InAs, InSb, in order
to minimize the deviation between the theoretical and experimental values of the band gap and SOC.
Structural relaxation effects were also included. Except for AlP, whose $\alpha = 0.127$, we obtained
$\alpha$ values spreading from 0.209 to 0.343, deviating less than 0.1 from the universal value
of 0.25. Our results for the lattice parameter and elastic constants indicate that the fitting of
the $\alpha$ does not affect those structural parameters when compared with the HSE06 functional,
where $\alpha = 0.25$. Our analysis of the band structure based on the $\textbf{k}{\cdot}\textbf{p}$
method shows that the effective masses are in agreement with the experimental values, which can
be attributed to the simultaneous fitting of the band gap and SOC. Finally, we estimate the values
of $g$-factors, extracted directly from band structure, which are close to experimental results
indicating that the obtained band structure produced a realistic set of $\textbf{k}{\cdot}\textbf{p}$
parameters.
