E. M. Purcell showed that a body has to perform non-reciprocal motion in order to propel itself in
a highly viscous environment. The swimmer with one degree of freedom is bound to do reciprocal motion,
whereby the center of mass of the swimmer will not be able to propel itself due to the Scallop theorem.
In the present study, we are proposing a new artificial swimmer called the one hinge swimmer. Here
we will show that flexibility plays a crucial role in the breakdown of Scallop theorem in the case
of one-hinge swimmer or two-dimensional scallop at low Reynolds number. To model a one-hinge artificial
swimmer, we use bead spring model for two arms joined by a hinge with bending potential for the arms
in order to make them semi-flexible. The fluid is simulated using a particle based mesoscopic simulation
method called the multi-particle collision dynamics with Anderson thermostat. Here we show that
when our swimmer has rigid arms, the center of mass of the swimmer is not able to propel itself as expected
from the Scallop theorem. When we introduce flexibility in the arms, the time reversal symmetry
breaks in the case of the one-hinged swimmer without the presence of a head contrary to the one-armed
super paramagnetic swimmer which required a passive head in order to swim. The reduced velocity
of the swimmer is studied using a range of parameters like flexibility, beating frequency and the
amplitude of the beat, where we obtain similar scaling as that of the one-armed super paramagnetic
swimmer. We also calculate the dimensionless Sperm number for the swimmer and we get the maximum
velocity when the Sperm number is around 1.7.
