Tetradymite-structured chalcogenides, such as bismuth telluride Bi_{2}Te_{3}, present significant
interest as technological materials for thermoelectric energy conversion and as examples of topological
insulators. Dislocations in such materials play a critical role during synthesis and processing
and can strongly affect functional properties of the materials. The dislocations existing between
quintuple layers present special interest as their core structure is controlled by the van der Waals
interactions between the layers. Although the discovery of such dislocations by electron microscopy
in the early 1960s was one of the first direct observations of dislocations in non-metallic materials,
their atomic-level core structure has remained elusive for decades. In this work, we have finally
resolved the basal dislocation core structure in Bi_{2}Te_{3} and quantified the disregistry
of the atomic planes across the dislocation core by atomic-resolution electron microscopy. We
show that, in spite of the existence of a stable stacking fault in the basal plane, the dislocation
core spreading is not caused by dissociation into two discrete partials as one would expect. Instead,
the wide spreading of the core is mainly due to the weak bonding between the layers, leading to a relatively
small energy penalty for layer sliding parallel to the van der Waals gap. The experimental findings
are supported by calculations within a semidiscrete variational Peierls-Nabarro model informed
by first-principles calculations, showing excellent agreement with experiment. The methodology
and conclusions of this work can be extended to other quasi-2D materials with van der Waals bonding
between layers.
