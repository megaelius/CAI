Recent studies reveal that resistive forces in granular intrusion can be explained with rate-independent
drag laws when intrusion is slow, but rate effects can occur in situations like dynamic impact. It
is challenging to determine the various roles of inertia at the bulk (macro) and grain (micro) scales,
as well as the role of rate in boundary interactions, and to reconcile the addition of these effects
with the rate-independent force response in reduced-order models like granular Resistive Force
Theory (RFT). Many studies measure the role of micro-inertia through a dimensionless shear-rate
known as the inertial number and use it to add strain-rate-dependence into the constitutive relations.
We demonstrate with data from rapid plate drag tests, freely locomoting rigid wheel experiments,
and legged runners that rate-dependent dynamics emerge even when the inertial number is negligibly
small. While a velocity-squared correction is often used to describe macro-inertial effects in
rapid plate drag cases, this correction is insufficient to reproduce the dynamics observed in more
complex intrusions like that of rigid wheel locomotion. We find a frictional flow continuum model
replicates all observed behaviors without inclusion of micro-inertial effects. Based on the characteristics
of the observed flows, we propose a modified rate-dependent RFT for arbitrary intruders. The form
reconciles all considered cases by adding a geometry-dependent modification and a macro-inertial
force to RFT. Our results reveal how rate-dependent mechanisms can emerge in rate-insensitive
granular media, and highlight the ability of simple physical corrections in enhancing the design
capabilities of reduced-order models like RFT.
