Functionally graded materials (FGMs), have drawn considerable attention of the worldwide researchers
and scientific community because of its unique mechanical, thermal and electrical properties
which may be exploited by varying the compositions gradually over volume. This makes FGM multifunctional
material (properties changing continuously in a certain direction) for specific purpose without
creating any phase interface thus making it superior to its composite counterparts. In this paper,
we applied Molecular Dynamics (MD) approach to investigate the mechanical properties of functional
graded Ni-Al alloy with Ni coating by applying uniaxial tension. Nickel-Aluminum (Ni-Al) alloy
has been used extensively in the industry due to its remarkable mechanical and thermal properties.
Our aim is to find the difference in material behavior when we change the grading function (linear,
elliptical and parabolic), temperature and crystallographic direction. We also observe distinct
type of failure mechanism for different grading function at different temperature. Close observation
reveals that elliptically graded Ni-Al alloy has high tensile strength at low temperature whereas
at high temperature, the highest tensile strength is found for parabolic grading. Besides, at any
temperature, the parabolically graded Ni-Al alloy shows superior elasticity than its elliptical
and linear counterpart. Moreover, it is also observed that [111] crystallographic direction for
this alloy demonstrates more resistivity towards failure than any other crystallographic direction.
It is found that lattice disorder plays a significant role on the mechanical properties of Functionally
Graded Materials (FGMs). This paper details a pathway to tune the mechanical properties like Young's
Modulus, plasticity and yield strength at molecular level by varying the composition of materials
along different grading functions.
