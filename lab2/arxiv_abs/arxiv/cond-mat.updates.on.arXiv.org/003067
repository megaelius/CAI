We report a new result concerning the dynamics of an initially localized wave packet in quantum nonlinear
Schr\"odinger lattices with a disordered potential. A class of nonlinear lattices with subquadratic
power nonlinearity is considered. We show that there exists a parameter range for which an initially
localized wave packet can spread along the lattice to unlimited distances, but the phenomenon is
purely quantum and is hindered in the corresponding classical lattices. The mechanism for this
spreading assumes that the components of the wave field may form coupled states by tunneling under
the topological barriers caused by multiple discontinuities in the operator space. Then these
coupled states thought of as quasiparticle states can propagate to long distances on L\'evy flights
with a distribution of waiting times. The overall process is subdiffusive and occurs as a competition
between long-distance jumps of the quasiparticle states, on the one hand, and long-time trapping
phenomena mediated by clustering of unstable modes in wave number space, on the other hand. The kinetic
description of the transport, discussed in this work, is based on fractional-derivative equations
allowing for both non-Markovianity of the spreading process as a result of attractive interaction
among the unstable modes and the effect of long-range correlations in wave number space tending
to introduce fast channels for the transport, the so-called stripes. We argue that the notion of
stripes is key to understand the topological constraints behind the quantum spreading, and we involve
the idea of stripy ordering to obtain self-consistently the parameters of the associated waiting-time
and jump-length distributions. Finally, we predict the asymptotic laws for quantum transport
and show that the relevant parameter determining these laws is the exponent of the power-law defining
the type of the nonlinearity.
