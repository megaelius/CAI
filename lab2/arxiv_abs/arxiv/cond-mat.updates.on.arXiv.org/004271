A number of topological nodes including Dirac, quadratic and triple band touching points as well
as a pair of degenerate Dirac line nodes are found to emerge in the triplet plaquette excitations
of the frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg honeycomb model when the
ground state of the system lies in a spin-disordered plaquette-valence-bond-solid phase. A six-spin
plaquette operator theory of this honeycomb model has been developed for this purpose by using the
eigenstates of an isolated Heisenberg hexagonal plaquette. Spin-1/2 operators are thus expressed
in the Fock space spanned by the plaquette operators those are obtained in terms of exact analytic
form of eigenstates for a single frustrated Heisenberg hexagon. Ultimately, an effective interacting
boson model of this system is obtained on the basis of low energy singlets and triplets plaquette
operators by employing a mean-field approximation. The values of ground state energy and spin gap
of this system have been estimated and the validity of this formalism has been tested upon comparison
with the known results. Emergence of topological point and line nodes on the basis of spin-disordered
ground state noted in this investigation is very rare on any frustrated system as well as the presence
of triplet flat band. Evolution of those topological nodes is studied throughout the full frustrated
regime. Finally, emergence of topological phases has been reported upon adding a time-reversal-symmetry
breaking term to the Hamiltonian. Coexistence of spin gap with either topological nodes or phases
turns this honeycomb model an interesting one.
