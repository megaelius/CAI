We define the concept of an `open' Markov process, a continuous-time Markov chain equipped with
specified boundary states through which probability can flow in and out of the system. External
couplings which fix the probabilities of boundary states induce non-equilibrium steady states
characterized by non-zero probability currents flowing through the system. We show that these
non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call `dissipation.' This is closely
related to Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production. We bound the rate of change of the
entropy of a driven non-equilibrium steady state relative to the underlying equilibrium state
in terms of the flow of probability through the boundary of the process. We then consider open Markov
processes as morphisms in a symmetric monoidal category by splitting up their boundary states into
certain sets of `inputs' and `outputs.' Composition corresponds to gluing the outputs of one such
open Markov process onto the inputs of another so that the probability flowing out of the first process
is equal to the probability flowing into the second. We construct a `black-box' functor characterizing
the behavior of an open Markov process in terms of the space of possible steady state probabilities
and probability currents along the boundary. The fact that this is a functor means that the behavior
of a composite open Markov process can be computed by composing the behaviors of the open Markov processes
from which it is composed. We prove a similar black-boxing theorem for reaction networks whose dynamics
are given by the non-linear rate equation. Along the way we describe a more general category of open
dynamical systems where composition corresponds to gluing together open dynamical systems.
