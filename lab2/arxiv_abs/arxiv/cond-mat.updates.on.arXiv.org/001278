Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) system at Landau level filling fraction $\nu=5/2$ has long been suggested
to be non-Abelian, either Pfaffian (Pf) or antiPfaffian (APf) states by numerical studies, both
with quantized Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}=5e^2/2h$. Thermal Hall conductances of the Pf and
APf states are quantized at $\kappa_{xy}=7/2$ and $\kappa_{xy}=3/2$ respectively in a proper
unit. However, a recent experiment shows the thermal Hall conductance of $\nu=5/2$ FQH state is
$\kappa_{xy}=5/2$. It has been speculated that the system contains random Pf and APf domains driven
by disorders, and the neutral chiral Majorana modes on the domain walls may undergo a percolation
transition to a $\kappa_{xy}=5/2$ phase. In this work, we do perturbative and non-perturbative
analyses on the domain walls between Pf and APf. We show the domain wall theory possesses an emergent
SO(4) symmetry at energy scales below a threshold $\Lambda_1$, which is lowered to an emergent U(1)$\times$U(1)
symmetry at energy scales between $\Lambda_1$ and a higher value $\Lambda_2$, and is finally lowered
to the composite fermion parity symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ above $\Lambda_2$. Based on the emergent
symmetries, we propose a specific phase diagram of the disordered $\nu=5/2$ FQH system, and show
that a $\kappa_{xy}=5/2$ phase arises at disorder energy scales $\Lambda>\Lambda_1$. Furthermore,
we show the gapped double-semion sector of $N_D$ closed domain walls contributes non-local topological
degeneracy $2^{N_D-1}$, causing a low temperature peak in the heat capacity. We also implement
a non-perturbative method to bootstrap generic topological 1+1D domain walls (2-surface defects)
applicable to any non-Abelian topological order.
