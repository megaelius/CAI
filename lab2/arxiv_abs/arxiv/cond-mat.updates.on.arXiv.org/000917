Recent discovery of both gapped and gapless topological phases in weakly correlated electron systems
has introduced various relativistic particles and a number of exotic phenomena in condensed matter
physics. The Weyl fermion is a prominent example of three dimensional (3D), gapless topological
excitation, which has been experimentally identified in inversion symmetry breaking semimetals.
However, their realization in spontaneously time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking magnetically
ordered states of correlated materials has so far remained hypothetical. Here, we report a set of
experimental evidence for elusive magnetic Weyl fermions in Mn$_3$Sn, a non-collinear antiferromagnet
that exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect even at room temperature. Detailed comparison between
our angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations reveals significant bandwidth renormalization and damping effects due to
the strong correlation among Mn 3$d$ electrons. Moreover, our transport measurements have unveiled
strong evidence for the chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions, namely, the emergence of positive magnetoconductance
only in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic Weyl fermions of Mn$_3$Sn
have a significant technological potential, since a weak field ($\sim$ 10 mT) is adequate for controlling
the distribution of Weyl points and the large fictitious field ($\sim$ a few 100 T) in the momentum
space. Our discovery thus lays the foundation for a new field of science and technology involving
the magnetic Weyl excitations of strongly correlated electron systems.
