The Boltzmann kinetic equation for low-density granular suspensions under simple shear flow is
considered to determine the velocity moments through the fourth degree. The influence of the interstitial
gas on solid particles is modeled by a viscous drag force term plus a stochastic Langevin-like term.
Two independent but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, to
keep the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator, the so-called inelastic Maxwell models
(IMM) are considered. In this model, since the collision rate is independent of the relative velocity
of the two colliding particles, the forms of the collisional moments can be obtained without the
knowledge of the velocity distribution function. As a complement of the previous effort, a BGK-type
kinetic model adapted to granular gases is solved to get the velocity moments of the velocity distribution
function. The analytical predictions of the rheological properties (which are \emph{exactly}
obtained in terms of the coefficient of restitution $\alpha$ and the reduced shear rate $a^*$) show
in general an excellent agreement with event-driven simulations performed for inelastic hard
spheres. In particular, both theoretical approaches show clearly that the temperature and non-Newtonian
viscosity exhibit an $S$ shape in a plane of stress-strain rate (discontinuous shear thickening
effect). With respect to the fourth-degree velocity moments, we find that while those moments have
unphysical values for IMM in a certain region of the parameter space of the system, they are well defined
functions of both $\alpha$ and $a^*$ in the case of the BGK kinetic model. The explicit shear-rate
dependence of the fourth-degree moments beyond this critical region is also obtained and compared
against available computer simulations.
