Despite the uniquely high thermal conductivity of graphene is well known, the exploitation of graphene
nanosheets into thermally conductive nanomaterials and devices is limited by the inefficiency
of thermal contacts between the individual nanosheets. A fascinating yet experimentally challenging
route to enhance thermal conductance at contacts between graphene nanosheets is through molecular
junctions, allowing covalently connecting nanosheets otherwise interacting only via weak Van
der Waals forces. Beside the bare existence of covalent connections, the choice of molecular structures
to be used as thermal junctions should be guided by their vibrational properties, in terms of phonon
transfer through the molecular junction. In this paper, density functional tight-binding combined
with Green functions formalism was applied for the calculation of thermal conductance and phonon
spectra of several different aliphatic and aromatic molecular junctions between graphene contacts.
Effect of molecular junction length, conformation, and aromaticity were studied in detail and
correlated with phonon tunnelling spectra. The theoretical insight provided by this work can guide
future experimental studies to select suitable molecular junctions in order to enhance the thermal
transport by suppressing the interfacial thermal resistances, particularly attractive for various
systems, including graphene nanopapers and graphene polymer nanocomposites, as well as related
devices. In a broader view, the possibility to design molecular junctions to control phonon transport
currently appears as an efficient way to produce phononic devices and controlling heat management
in nanostructures.
