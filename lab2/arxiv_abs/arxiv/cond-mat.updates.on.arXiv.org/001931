We construct a general wave function with the topological order by introducing the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
gauge degrees of freedom, characterizing both the toric code state and double semion state. Via
calculating the correlation length defined from the one-dimensional quantum transfer operator
of the wave function norm, we can map out the complete phase diagram in terms of the parameter $\lambda
$ and identify three different quantum critical points (QCPs) at $\lambda =0$, $\pm 1.73$. The first
one separates the toric code phase and double semion phase, while later two describe the topological
phase transitions from the toric code phase or double semion phase to the symmetry breaking phase,
respectively. When mapping to the exactly solved statistical models, the norm of the tensor network
wave function is transformed into the partition function of the eight-vertex model. Actually such
a quantum-classical mapping can not reveal the rich structures of low-energy excitations at these
three QCPs. So we further demonstrate that the full eigenvalue spectra of the transfer operators
with/without the flux insertions can describe the complete quantum criticalities, which are characterized
by the two-dimensional compactified free boson conformal field theories (CFTs) with the compactified
radii $R=\sqrt{6}$ for the QCPs at $\lambda =\pm\sqrt{3}$ and $R=\sqrt{8/3}$ for the QCP at $\lambda
=0$. For the QCP at $\lambda =0$, there are no anyon condensation, and the emerged matrix product
operator symmetries result in a rich structure of the low-energy excitations, distinct from those
of both toric code and double semion phases. Finally, we discuss the possible relation between our
conformal quantum criticalities and the general (2+1) spatial-time dimensional CFTs for quantum
topological phase transitions.
