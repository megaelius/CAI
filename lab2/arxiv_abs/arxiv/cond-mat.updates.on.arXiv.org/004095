We investigate the physics of quasicrystalline lattices in the presence of a uniform magnetic field,
focusing on the presence and construction of topological states. This is done by using the Hofstadter
model but with the sites and couplings denoted by the vertex model of the quasicrystal, giving the
Hofstadter vertex model. We specifically consider two-dimensional quasicrystals made from tilings
of two tiles with incommensurate areas, focusing on the five-fold Penrose and the eight-fold Ammann-Beenker
tilings. This introduces two competing scales; the uniform magnetic field and the incommensurate
scale of the cells of the lattice. Due to these competing scales the periodicity of the Hofstadter
butterfly is destroyed. We observe the presence of topological edge states on the boundary of the
system via the Bott index that exhibit two way transport along the edge. For the eight-fold lattice
we also observe internal edge-like states with non-zero Bott index, which exhibit two way transport
along this internal edge. The presence of these internal edge states is a new characteristic of quasicrystalline
lattices in magnetic fields. We then move on to considering interacting systems. This is challenging,
in part because exact diagonalization on a few tens of sites is not expected to be enough to accurately
capture the physics of the quasicrystalline lattice, and in part because it is not clear how to construct
topological flatbands having a large number of states. We show that these problems can be circumvented
by building the models analytically, and in this way we construct models with Laughlin type fractional
quantum Hall ground states.
