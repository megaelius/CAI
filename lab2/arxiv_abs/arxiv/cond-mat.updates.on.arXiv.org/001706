We present sample transfer instrumentation and integrated protocols for the preparation and correlative
characterization of environmentally-sensitive materials by both atom probe tomography and electron
microscopy. Ultra-high vacuum cryogenic suitcases allow specimen transfer between preparation,
processing and several imaging platforms without exposure to atmospheric contamination. For
expedient transfers, we installed a fast-docking station equipped with a cryogenic pump upon three
systems; two atom probes, a scanning electron microscope / Xe-plasma focused ion beam and a N$_2$-atmosphere
glovebox. We also installed a plasma FIB with a solid-state cooling stage to reduce beam damage and
contamination, through reducing chemical activity and with the cryogenic components as passive
cryogenic traps. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new laboratory protocols by the successful
preparation and transfer of two highly contamination- and temperature-sensitive samples - water
and ice. Analysing pure magnesium atom probe data, we show that surface oxidation can be effectively
suppressed using an entirely cryogenic protocol (during specimen preparation and during transfer).
Starting with the cryogenically-cooled plasma FIB, we also prepared and transferred frozen ice
samples while avoiding significant melting or sublimation, suggesting that we may be able to measure
the nanostructure of other normally-liquid or soft materials. Isolated cryogenic protocols within
the N$_2$ glove box demonstrate the absence of ice condensation suggesting that environmental
control can commence from fabrication until atom probe analysis.
