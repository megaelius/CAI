The iron-based superconductors are characterized by multiple-orbital physics where all the five
Fe 3$d$ orbitals get involved. The multiple-orbital nature gives rise to various novel phenomena
like orbital-selective Mott transition, nematicity and orbital fluctuation that provide a new
route for realizing superconductivity. The complexity of multiple-orbital also asks to disentangle
the relationship between orbital, spin and nematicity, and to identify dominant orbital ingredients
that dictate superconductivity. The bulk FeSe superconductor provides an ideal platform to address
these issues because of its simple crystal structure and unique coexistence of superconductivity
and nematicity. However, the orbital nature of the low energy electronic excitations and its relation
to the superconducting gap remain controversial. Here we report direct observation of highly anisotropic
Fermi surface and extremely anisotropic superconducting gap in the nematic state of FeSe superconductor
by high resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements. We find that the low
energy excitations of the entire hole pocket at the Brillouin zone center are dominated by the single
$d_{xz}$ orbital. The superconducting gap exhibits an anti-correlation relation with the $d_{xz}$
spectral weight near the Fermi level, i.e., the gap size minimum (maximum) corresponds to the maximum
(minimum) of the $d_{xz}$ spectral weight along the Fermi surface. These observations provide
new insights in understanding the orbital origin of the extremely anisotropic superconducting
gap in FeSe superconductor and the relation between nematicity and superconductivity in the iron-based
superconductors.
