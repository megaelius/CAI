It is well established that topological insulators sustain Dirac fermion surface states as a consequence
of band inversion in the bulk. These states have a helical spin polarization and a linear dispersion
with large Fermi velocity. In this article we report on a set of experimental observations indicating
the existence of massive surface states. These states are confined at the interface and dominate
equilibrium and transport properties at high energy and/or high electric field. By monitoring
the AC admittance of HgTe topological insulator field-effect capacitors, we access the compressibility
and conductivity of surface states in a broad range of energy and electric fields. The Dirac surface
states are characterized by a compressibility minimum, a linear energy dependence and a high mobility
persisting up to energies much larger than the transport bandgap of the bulk. New features are revealed
at high energies with signatures such as conductance peaks, compressibility bumps, a strong charge
metastability and a Hall resistance anomaly. These features point to the existence of excited massive
surface states, responsible for a strong intersubband scattering with the Dirac states and the
nucleation of metastable bulk carriers. The spectrum of excited states agrees with predictions
of a phenomenological model of the topological-trivial semiconductor interface. The model accounts
for the finite interface depth and the effect of electric fields. The existence of excited topological
states is essential for the understanding of topological phases and opens a route for engineering
and exploiting topological resources in quantum technology.
