Fractons are emergent particles which are immobile in isolation, but which can move together in
dipolar pairs or other small clusters. These exotic excitations naturally occur in certain quantum
phases of matter described by tensor gauge theories. Previous research has focused on the properties
of small numbers of fractons and their interactions, effectively mapping out the "Standard Model"
of fractons. In the present work, however, we consider systems with a finite density of either fractons
or their dipolar bound states, with a focus on the $U(1)$ fracton models. We study some of the phases
in which emergent fractonic matter can exist, thereby initiating the study of the "condensed matter"
of fractons. We begin by considering a system with a finite density of fractons, which we show can
exhibit microemulsion physics, in which fractons form small-scale clusters emulsed in a phase
dominated by long-range repulsion. We then move on to study systems with a finite density of mobile
dipoles, which have phases analogous to many conventional condensed matter phases. We focus on
two major examples: Fermi liquids and quantum Hall phases. A finite density of fermionic dipoles
will form a Fermi surface and enter a Fermi liquid phase. Interestingly, this dipolar Fermi liquid
exhibits a finite-temperature phase transition, corresponding to an unbinding transition of
fractons. Finally, we study chiral two-dimensional phases corresponding to dipoles in "quantum
Hall" states of their emergent magnetic field. We study numerous aspects of these generalized quantum
Hall systems, such as their edge theories and ground state degeneracies.
