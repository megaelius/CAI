When irradiated via high frequency circularly polarized light, the stroboscopic dynamics in a
Heisenberg spin system on a honeycomb lattice develops a next nearest neighbor (NNN) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) type term\cite{owerre}, making it a magnonic Floquet topological insulator. We investigate
the entanglement generation and its evolution on such systems - particularly an irradiated ferromagnetic
XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model in a honeycomb lattice as the system parameters are optically tuned.
In the high frequency limit, we compute the lowest quasi-energy state entanglement in terms of the
concurrence between nearest neighbor (NN) and NNN pair of spins and witness the entanglement transitions
occurring there. For the easy axis scenario, the unirradiated system forms a product state but entanglement
grows between the NNN spin pairs beyond some cut-off DM strength. Contrarily in easy planar case,
NN and NNN spins remain already entangled in the unirradiated limit. It then goes through an entanglement
transition which causes decrease (increase) of the NN (NNN) concurrences down to zero (up to some
higher value) at some critical finite DM interaction strength. For a high frequency of irradiation
and a suitably chosen anisotropy parameter, we can vary the field strength to witness sudden death
and revival of entanglement in the Floquet system. Both exact diagonalization and modified Lanczos
techniques are used to obtain the results upto 24 site lattice. We also calculate the thermal entanglement
and obtain estimates for the threshold temperatures below which non-zero concurrence can be expected
in the system.
