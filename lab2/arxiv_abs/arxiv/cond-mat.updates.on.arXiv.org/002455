We consider a dilute gas of bosons with repulsive contact interactions, described on the mean-field
level by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and confined by an impenetrable wall (either rigid or flexible).
We solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for excitations on top of the Bose-Einstein condensate
analytically, by using matrix-valued hypergeometric functions. This leads to the exact spectrum
of gapless Bogoliubov excitations localized near the boundary, which form an excitation branch
separated from the bulk excitation spectrum of the condensate by a finite binding energy. Here,
either the surface of liquid helium, for which mean-field theory represents an approximation,
may constitute the boundary, or alternatively the surface of a box-trapped dilute Bose-Einstein-condensed
gas, provided that the walls of the box can be made either effectively rigid or flexible. The dispersion
relation for the surface excitations gives for small wavenumbers $k$ a ripplon mode with fractional
dispersion relation for a flexible wall, and a phonon mode (linear dispersion) for a rigid wall.
For both modes we provide, for the first time, the exact dispersion relations of the dilute quantum
liquid for all $k$ along the surface, extending to $k \rightarrow \infty$. For a rigid wall with zero
boundary conditions we provide an exact algebraic equation for the energy spectrum, while for the
ripplon mode the energy spectrum can be obtained by a hypergeometric series, which even to lowest
order is close to the one obtained from a numerical solution. The small wavelength excitations are
shown to be bound to the surface with a maximal {\em universal} binding energy $\Delta\simeq 0.158\,
mc^2$, identical for both excitation branches, where $m$ is mass of bosons and $c$ bulk speed of sound.
