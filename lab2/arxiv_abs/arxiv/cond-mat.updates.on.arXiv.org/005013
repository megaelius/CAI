Disorder has different profound effects on superconducting thin films. For a large variety of materials,
increasing disorder reduces electronic screening which enhances electron-electron repulsion.
These fermionic effects lead to a mechanism described by Finkelstein: when disorder combined to
electron-electron interactions increases, there is a global decrease of the superconducting
energy gap $\Delta$ and of the critical temperature $T_c$, the ratio $\Delta$/$k_BT_c$ remaining
roughly constant. In addition, in most films an emergent granularity develops with increasing
disorder and results in the formation of inhomogeneous superconducting puddles. These gap inhomogeneities
are usually accompanied by the development of bosonic features: a pseudogap develops above the
critical temperature $T_c$ and the energy gap $\Delta$ starts decoupling from $T_c$. Thus the mechanism(s)
driving the appearance of these gap inhomogeneities could result from a complicated interplay
between fermionic and bosonic effects. By studying the local electronic properties of a NbN film
with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) we show that the inhomogeneous spatial distribution
of $\Delta$ is locally strongly correlated to a large depletion in the local density of states (LDOS)
around the Fermi level, associated to the Altshuler-Aronov effect induced by strong electronic
interactions. By modelling quantitatively the measured LDOS suppression, we show that the latter
can be interpreted as local variations of the film resistivity. This local change in resistivity
leads to a local variation of $\Delta$ through a local Finkelstein mechanism. Our analysis furnishes
a purely fermionic scenario explaining quantitatively the emergent superconducting inhomogeneities,
while the precise origin of the latter remained unclear up to now.
