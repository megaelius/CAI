The Navier--Stokes transport coefficients of multicomponent granular suspensions at moderate
densities are obtained in the context of the (inelastic) Enskog kinetic theory. The suspension
is modeled as an ensemble of solid particles where the influence of the interstitial gas on grains
is via a viscous drag force plus a stochastic Langevin-like term defined in terms of a background
temperature. In the absence of spatial gradients, it is shown first that the system reaches a homogeneous
steady state where the energy lost by inelastic collisions and viscous friction is compensated
for by the energy injected by the stochastic force. Once the homogeneous steady state is characterized,
a \emph{normal} solution to the set of Enskog equations is obtained by means of the Chapman--Enskog
expansion around the \emph{local} version of the homogeneous state. To first-order in spatial
gradients, the Chapman--Enskog solution allows us to identify the Navier--Stokes transport coefficients
associated with the mass, momentum, and heat fluxes. In addition, the first-order contributions
to the partial temperatures and the cooling rate are also calculated. Explicit forms for the diffusion
coefficients, the shear and bulk viscosities, and the first-order contributions to the partial
temperatures and the cooling rate are obtained in steady-state conditions by retaining the leading
terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. The results show that the dependence of the transport coefficients
on inelasticity is clearly different from that found in its granular counterpart (no gas phase).
The present work extends previous theoretical results for \emph{dilute} multicomponent granular
suspensions [Khalil and Garz\'o, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{88}, 052201 (2013)] to higher densities.
