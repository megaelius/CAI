This study deals the formation process of tiny particles when gold atoms are in certain transition
state of their electrons under the getup of monolayer assembly at solution surface for different
processing time. Atoms of tiny particles bind under nano shape energy at solution surface resulting
into elongate from the centre developing structure of smooth elements of one-dimensional arrays.
A double-packet nano shape energy when placed over atoms of monolayer assembly results into bind
them into tiny particle of own shape if distribution of atoms is in good agreement. Tiny particles
pack to develop particles for different processing time where observed developing rate of their
extended shapes is not more than millisecond time depending on the size of individual particle.
Adjacent placement of electrons in atoms of tiny particle is under the stretching of clamping energy
knots while adjusting their potential energy as per influencing force of surface format at opposite
poles. Tiny particles developing near zero-force axis of surface format at solution surface, their
atoms elongate less from the centers because of gaining less potential energy of electrons. So,
in this case, particles of shape like rod and bar are developed. Tiny particles where their atoms
elongate more, they develop particles shape like hexagon and triangle measuring less width of structure
of smooth elements and their inter-spacing distance as compared to in particles shape like rod and
bar. Different widths of smooth elements in one-dimensional and three-dimensional shaped particles
are measured by selective area photon reflection patterns giving the same measurement as in the
case of their high-resolution images. Lateral placement of electrons under expansion or contraction
of clamping energy knots provide the provision to bind structure of smooth elements.
