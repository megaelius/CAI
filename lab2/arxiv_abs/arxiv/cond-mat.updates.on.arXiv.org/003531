A combined generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement and density functional theory
calculation analysis is performed to obtain the complete set of infrared active phonon modes in
Lu$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ with monoclinic crystal structure. Two different crystals, each cut perpendicular
to a different crystal axis are investigated. Ellipsometry measurements from 40 - 1200 cm$^{-1}$
are used to determine the frequency dependent dielectric function tensor elements. The eigendielectric
displacement vector summation approach and eigendielectric displacement loss vector summation
approach both augmented with anharmonic lattice broadening parameters proposed recently for
low-symmetry crystal structures [A. Mock et al., Phys. Rev. B 95, 165202 (2017)] are applied for
our ellipsometry data analysis. All measured and model calculated dielectric function tensor
and inverse dielectric function tensor elements match excellently. 23 $\mathrm{A_{u}}$ symmetry
and 22 $\mathrm{B_{u}}$ symmetry infrared active transverse and longitudinal optical modes are
found. We also determine the directional limiting modes and the order of the phonon modes within
the monoclinic plane. Results from density functional theory and ellipsometry measurements are
compared and nearly perfect agreement is observed. We further compare our results to those obtained
recently for the monoclinic crystal Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$, which is isostructural to Lu$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$
[A. Mock et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 165203 (2018)]. We find that the lattice mode behavior of monoclinic
Lu$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ is qualitatively identical with Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$, and differs only quantitatively.
We anticipate that members of the isostructural group of monoclinic symmetry oxyorthosilicates
such as Dy$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ or Yb$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ will likely behave very similar in their phonon
mode properties as reported here for Lu$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$.
