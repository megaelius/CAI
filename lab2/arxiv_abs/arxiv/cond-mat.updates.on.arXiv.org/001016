Bottom-up graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions are nanoscale strips of graphene whose electronic
structure abruptly changes across a covalently bonded interface. Their rational design offers
opportunities for profound technological advancements enabled by their extraordinary structural
and electronic properties. Thus far the most critical aspect of their synthesis, the control over
sequence and position of heterojunctions along the length of a ribbon, has been plagued by randomness
in monomer sequences emerging from step-growth copolymerization of distinct monomers. All bottom-up
GNR heterojunction structures created so far have exhibited random sequences of heterojunctions
and, while useful for fundamental scientific studies, are difficult to incorporate into functional
nanodevices as a result. Here we describe a new hierarchical fabrication strategy that allows deterministic
growth of bottom-up GNRs that preferentially exhibit a single heterojunction interface rather
than a random statistical sequence of junctions along the ribbon. Such heterojunctions provide
a viable new platform that could be directly used in functional GNR-based device applications at
the molecular scale. Our hierarchical GNR fabrication strategy is based on differences in the dissociation
energies of C-Br and C-I bonds that allow control over the growth sequence of the block-copolymers
from which GNRs are formed, and consequently yields a significantly higher proportion of single-junction
GNR heterostructures. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations
confirm that hierarchically-grown heterojunctions between chevron GNR (cGNR) and binaphthyl-cGNR
segments exhibit straddling Type I band alignment in structures that are only one atomic layer thick
and 3 nm in width.
