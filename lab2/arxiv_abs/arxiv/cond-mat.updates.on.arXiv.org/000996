Nanoscale systems offer key capabilities for quantum technologies that include single qubit control
and readout, multiple qubit gate operation, extremely sensitive and localized sensing and imaging,
as well as the ability to build hybrid quantum systems. To fully exploit these functionalities,
multiple degrees of freedom are highly desirable: in this respect, nanoscale systems that coherently
couple to light and possess spins, allow for storage of photonic qubits or light-matter entanglement
together with processing capabilities. In addition, all-optical control of spins can be possible
for faster gate operations and higher spatial selectivity compared to direct RF excitation. Such
systems are therefore of high interest for quantum communications and processing. However, an
outstanding challenge is to preserve properties, and especially optical and spin coherence lifetimes,
at the nanoscale. Indeed, interactions with surfaces related perturbations strongly increase
as sizes decrease, although the smallest objects present the highest flexibility for integration
with other systems. Here, we demonstrate optically controlled nuclear spins with long coherence
lifetimes (T2) in rare earth doped nanoparticles. We observed spins echoes and measured T2 of 2.9
+/- 0.3 ms at 5 K and under a magnetic field of 9 mT, a value comparable to those obtained in bulk single
crystals. Moreover, we achieve, for the first time, spin T2 extension using all-optical spin dynamical
decoupling and observe high fidelity between excitation and echo phases. Rare-earth doped nanoparticles
are thus the only reported nano-materials in which optically controlled spins with millisecond
coherence lifetimes have been observed. These results open the way to providing quantum light-atom-spin
interfaces with long storage time within hybrid architectures.
