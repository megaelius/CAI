Excess heat in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) that is produced during their operation may
accelerate their degradation and may cause an inhomogeneous brightness distribution, in particular
in large area OLEDs. Assessing the quantitative impact of heat excess is difficult, because all
decisive processes related to charge transport and emission via charge recombination are thermally
activated. For example, electric currents that are elevated due to larger temperatures cause additional
Joule heating and increase, hence, the device temperature even further. Here we establish how parameters
responsible for heat transport, i.e., the thermal conductivity of the organic layers and the heat
transfer coefficient between the device surface and the environment govern the temperature inside
the OLED. We establish, relying on three-dimensional drift-diffusion simulations that self-consistently
couple thermally-activated charge transport and heat transport, that the thermal conductivity
of organic layers is not a bottleneck for heat transport, because the encountered layer thicknesses
in realistic device geometries prevent heat accumulation. The heat transfer to the ambient environment
is the key parameter to dissipate excess heat from the device. Intentionally elevated operating
temperatures, that may improve the OLEDs electric performance, are not necessarily beneficial,
as any increase in operating temperature decreases the device stability. The thermal effects being
decisive for the OLED temperature occur in device layers beyond the electrically active region.
We propose analytical expressions that relate the temperature in the device for a given point of
operation to the heat transfer to the environment and the substrate.
