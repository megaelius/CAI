Coherency misfit stresses and their related anisotropies are known to influence the equilibrium
shapes of precipitates. Additionally, mechanical properties of the alloys are also dependent
on the shapes of the precipitates. Therefore, in order to investigate the mechanical response of
a material which undergoes precipitation during heat treatment, it is important to derive the range
of precipitate shapes that evolve. In this regard, several studies have been conducted in the past
using sharp interface approaches where the influence of elastic energy anisotropy on the precipitate
shapes has been investigated. In this paper, we propose a diffuse interface approach which allows
us to minimize grid-anisotropy related issues applicable in sharp-interface methods. In this
context, we introduce a novel phase-field method where we minimize the functional consisting of
the elastic and surface energy contributions while preserving the precipitate volume. Using this
method we reproduce the shape-bifurcation diagrams for the cases of pure dilatational misfit that
have been studied previously using sharp interface methods and then extend them to include interfacial
energy anisotropy with different anisotropy strengths which has not been a part of previous sharp-interface
models. While we restrict ourselves to cubic anisotropies in both elastic and interfacial energies
in this study, the model is generic enough to handle any combination of anisotropies in both the bulk
and interfacial terms. Further, we have examined the influence of asymmetry in dilatational misfit
strains along with interfacial energy anisotropy on precipitate morphologies.
