The biaxial van der Waals semiconductor $\alpha$-phase molybdenum trioxide ($\alpha$-MoO$_3$)
has recently received significant attention due to its ability to support highly anisotropic phonon
polaritons (PhPs) -infrared (IR) light coupled to lattice vibrations in polar materials -- offering
an unprecedented platform for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale. However, to fully
exploit the extraordinary IR response of this material, an accurate dielectric function is required.
Here, we report the accurate IR dielectric function of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ by modelling far-field,
polarized IR reflectance spectra acquired on a single thick flake of this material. Unique to our
work, the far-field model is refined by contrasting the experimental dispersion and damping of
PhPs, revealed by polariton interferometry using scattering-type scanning near-field optical
microscopy (s-SNOM) on thin flakes of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, with analytical and transfer-matrix
calculations, as well as full-wave simulations. Through these correlative efforts, exceptional
quantitative agreement is attained to both far- and near-field properties for multiple flakes,
thus providing strong verification of the accuracy of our model, while offering a novel approach
to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials, usually too small or inhomogeneous for establishing
accurate models only from standard far-field methods. In addition, by employing density functional
theory (DFT), we provide insights into the various vibrational states dictating our dielectric
function model and the intriguing optical properties of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$.
