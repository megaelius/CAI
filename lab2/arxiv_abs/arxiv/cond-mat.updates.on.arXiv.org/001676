Two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity is a fascinating phenomenon packed with rich physics
and wide technological application. The vortices and their dynamics arising from classical and
quantum fluctuations give rise to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition and 2D Bose
metallic phase both of which are of fundamental interest. In 2D, observation of superconductivity
and the associated phenomena are sensitive to material disorders. Highly crystalline and inherently
2D van der Waals (vW) systems with carrier concentration and conductivity approaching metallic
regime have been a potential platform. The metallic 1T phase of MoS2, a widely explored vW material
system controllably, engineered from the semiconducting 2H phase, is a tangible choice. Here,
we report the observation of 2D superconductivity accompanied by BKT transition and Bose metallic
state in a few-layer 1T-MoS2. Structural characterization shows excellent crystallinity over
extended lateral dimension. The electrical characterization confirms the metallic nature down
to 4 K and a transition to a superconducting state below 1.2 K with a Tc ~ 920 mK. The 2D nature of the superconducting
state is confirmed from the magneto-transport anisotropy against field orientations and the presence
of BKT transition. In addition, our sample showcases a manifold increase in the parallel upper-critical-field
above the Pauli limit. The inherent two-dimensionality and possibility of scalably engineering
semiconducting, metallic and superconducting phases makes MoS2 a potential candidate for hosting
monolithic all-two-dimensional hybrid quantum devices.
