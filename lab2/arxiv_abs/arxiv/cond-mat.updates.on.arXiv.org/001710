An algorithmic limit of compressed sensing or related variable-selection problems is analytically
evaluated when a design matrix is given by an overcomplete random matrix. The replica method from
statistical mechanics is employed to derive the result. The analysis is conducted through evaluation
of the entropy, an exponential rate of the number of combinations of variables giving a specific
value of fit error to given data which is assumed to be generated from a linear process using the design
matrix. This yields the typical achievable limit of the fit error when solving a representative
$\ell_0$ problem and includes the presence of unfavourable phase transitions preventing local
search algorithms from reaching the minimum-error configuration. The associated phase diagrams
are presented. A noteworthy outcome of the phase diagrams is, however, that there exists a wide parameter
region where any phase transition is absent from the high temperature to the lowest temperature
at which the minimum-error configuration or the ground state is reached. This implies that certain
local search algorithms can find the ground state with moderate computational costs in that region.
The theoretical evaluation of the entropy is confirmed by extensive numerical methods using the
exchange Monte Carlo and the multi-histogram methods. Another numerical test based on a metaheuristic
optimisation algorithm called simulated annealing is conducted, which well supports the theoretical
predictions on the local search algorithms and we can find the ground state with high probability
in polynomial time with respect to system size.
