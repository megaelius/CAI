We have carried out the powder x-ray diffraction and dielectric studies on multiferroic particulate
composite xNi0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4/(1-x)PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 with x=0.15, 0.30, 0.45, 0.60, 0.75 and 0.90
to explore the structural and ferroelectric properties. A conventional double sintering method
was used to prepare the xNi0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4/(1-x)PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 composites. The structure of
one of the component Ni0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4 is spinel cubic with space group Fd3m, while the other component
PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 is selected around the morphotropic phase boundary region in which the tetragonal
and monoclinic phases with space group P4mm and Cm coexist respectively. We have carried out Rietveld
refinement of the structure to check the formation of ideal composites with separate ferroelectric
and ferrite phases. Even though the structural characterization does not reveal the formation
of any new phase due to reaction between the two components of the composite during sintering, the
tetragonality of the PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 continuously decreases with increasing the ferrite fraction
while the lattice parameter of ferrite phase increases with increasing fraction of the ferroelectric
phase. Similarly, the dielectric study reveals clear shift in the ferroelectric to paraelectric
phase transition temperature of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 during composite formation suggesting that
part of Ni2+, Zn2+/ Fe3+ ions are diffusing at the B-site of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 replacing Ti4+, which
in turn decreases its transition temperature. Scanning electron micrograph of sintered pellet
surface confirms the presence of two types of particle morphology in the particulate composite,
corresponding to ferrite and ferroelectric phases.
