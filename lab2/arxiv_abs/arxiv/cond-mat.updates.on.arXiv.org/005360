In this study, we investigate the structure-stability relationship of hypothetical Nd-Fe-B crystal
structures using descriptor-relevance analysis and the t-SNE dimensionality reduction method.
149 hypothetical Nd-Fe-B crystal structures are generated from 5967 LA-T-X host structures in
Open Quantum Materials Database by using the elemental substitution method, with LA denoting lanthanides,
T denoting transition metals, and X denoting light elements such as B, C, N and O. A hypothetical crystal
structure is created by substituting all lanthanide sites with Nd, all transition metal sites with
Fe, and all light element sites with B. High-throughput first-principle calculations are applied
to evaluate the phase stability of these structures. Twenty of them are found to be potentially formable.
The descriptor-relevance analysis on the orbital field matrix (OFM) materials' descriptor reveals
the average atomic coordination number as the essential factor in determining the structure stability
of these substituted Nd-Fe-B crystal structures. 19 among 20 hypothetical structures that are
found potentially formable have an average coordination number larger than 6.5. In addition, all
the local structures represented by the OFM descriptors are integrated into a visible space to study
the detailed correlation between their characteristics and the stability of the crystal structure
to which they belong. We discover that unstable substituted structures frequently carry Nd and
Fe local structures with two prominent points: low average coordination numbers and fully occupied
B neighboring atoms. Moreover, there are only three popular forms of B local structures appearing
on all potentially formable substituted structures: cage networks, planar networks, and interstitial
sites. The discovered relationships are promising to speed up the screening process for the new
formable crystal structures.
