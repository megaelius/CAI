We study the electronic thermal drag in two different Coulomb-coupled systems, the first one composed
of two Coulomb blockaded metallic islands and the second one consisting of two parallel quantum
wires. The two conductors of each system are electrically isolated and placed in the two circuits
(the drive and the drag) of a four-electrode setup. The systems are biased, either by a temperature
$\Delta T$ or a voltage $V$ difference, on the drive circuit, while no biases are present on the drag
circuit. In the case of a pair of metallic islands we use a master equation approach to determine the
general properties of the dragged heat current $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$, accounting also for co-tunneling
contributions and the presence of large biases. Analytic results are obtained in the sequential
tunneling regime for small biases, finding, in particular, that $I^{\rm (h)}_{\rm drag}$ is quadratic
in $\Delta T$ or $V$ and non-monotonous as a function of the inter-island coupling. Finally, by replacing
one of the electrodes in the drag circuit with a superconductor, we find that heat can be extracted
from the other normal electrode. In the case of the two interacting quantum wires, using the Luttinger
liquid theory and the bosonization technique, we derive an analytic expression for the thermal
trans-resistivity $\rho^{\rm (h)}_{12}$, in the weak-coupling limit and at low temperatures.
$\rho^{\rm (h)}_{12}$ turns out to be proportional to the electric trans-resistivity $\rho^{\rm
(c)}_{12}$, in such a way that their ratio (a kind of Wiedemann-Franz law) is proportional to $T^3$.
We find that the thermal trans-resistivity is proportional to $T$ for low temperatures and decreases
like $1/T$ for intermediate temperatures or like $1/T^3$ for high temperatures. We complete our
analyses by performing numerical simulations that confirm the above results and allow to access
the strong coupling regime.
