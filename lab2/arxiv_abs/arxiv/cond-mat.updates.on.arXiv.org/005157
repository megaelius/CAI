We present a full symmetry classification of dissipatively evolving fermion matter. Our approach
is bottom up, starting from the ten different classes of linear and anti-linear state transformations
in fermionic Fock spaces. Both in unitary quantum mechanics and in the `micro-reversible' settings
of thermal equilibrium, the anti-linear transformations in conjunction with an explicit inversion
of physical time represent time reversal. However, out of equilibrium time reversal becomes meaningless,
while the anti-linear transformations in Fock space remain significant and now must be considered
in autonomy. Their different implementation and its consequences for the understanding of fermion
symmetries out of equilibrium is the central motif of our study. Following the logic of the bottom
up approach, we address the question under which conditions the irreversible evolution equations
describing the quantum dynamics of fermion matter remain invariant under the application of Fock
space transformations. This defines ten symmetry classes, separately for the generators of reversible
dynamics, dissipation and fluctuations featuring in these equations. We discuss their physical
manifestation both for interacting systems in the second quantized Fock space formalism, and for
the evolution of free fermion Gaussian states of matter, where the language of non-Hermitian matrices
is used. Emphasis will be put on the stationary phases forming as end points of dissipative evolution,
and in particular on the ensuing symmetry protected topological phases of dissipative matter.
The starting point of ten Fock space symmetries implies a transparent classification of these phases
and defines non-equilibrium blueprints for their realization from first principles, as we will
demonstrate on the exemplary case study of an interacting lattice model.
