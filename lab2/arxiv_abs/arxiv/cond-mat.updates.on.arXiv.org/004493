Inspired by the fast-pace evolution of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing technology,
novel resource-efficient hybrid quantum-classical approaches are under active development
to address grand scientific challenges faced by classical computations. Proof-of-principle
applications of NISQ technology in quantum chemistry have been reported in solving ground state
properties of small molecules. While several approaches have also been proposed to address the
long-standing strongly correlated materials problem, a complete calculation of periodic correlated
electron model systems on NISQ devices, as a crucial step forward, has not been demonstrated yet.
In this paper we showcase the first self-consistent hybrid quantum-classical calculations of
the periodic Anderson model on Rigetti quantum devices, within the Gutzwiller variational embedding
theoretical framework. It maps the infinite lattice problem to a quasi-particle Hamiltonian coupled
to a quantum many-body embedding system, which is solved on quantum devices to overcome the classical
exponential scaling in complexity. We show that the Gutzwiller hybrid quantum-classical embedding
(GQCE) framework describes very well the quantum phase transitions from Kondo insulator to metal
and from metal to Mott insulator in the correlated electron lattice model, with critical parameters
at the phase boundaries accurately determined. The GQCE simulation framework, equipped with a
full arsenal of evolving quantum algorithms to solve ground state and dynamics of quantum chemistry
or equivalently finite embedding systems, is a well-adapted approach toward resolving complicated
emergent properties in correlated condensed matter by exploiting NISQ technologies.
