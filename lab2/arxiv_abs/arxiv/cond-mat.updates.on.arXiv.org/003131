The electron-hole plasma in charge-neutral graphene is predicted to realize a quantum critical
system whose transport features a universal hydrodynamic description, even at room temperature.
This quantum critical "Dirac fluid" is expected to have a shear viscosity close to a minimum bound,
with an inter-particle scattering rate saturating at the Planckian time $\hbar/(k_B T)$. While
electrical transport measurements at finite carrier density are consistent with hydrodynamic
electron flow in graphene, a "smoking gun" of viscous behavior remains elusive. In this work, we
directly image viscous Dirac fluid flow in graphene at room temperature via measurement of the associated
stray magnetic field. Nanoscale magnetic imaging is performed using quantum spin magnetometers
realized with nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Scanning single-spin and wide-field magnetometry
reveals a parabolic Poiseuille profile for electron flow in a graphene channel near the charge neutrality
point, establishing the viscous transport of the Dirac fluid. This measurement is in contrast to
the conventional uniform flow profile imaged in an Ohmic conductor. Via combined imaging-transport
measurements, we obtain viscosity and scattering rates, and observe that these quantities are
comparable to the universal values expected at quantum criticality. This finding establishes
a nearly-ideal electron fluid in neutral graphene at room temperature. Our results pave the way
to study hydrodynamic transport in quantum critical fluids relevant to strongly-correlated electrons
in high-$T_c$ superconductors. This work also highlights the capability of quantum spin magnetometers
to probe correlated-electronic phenomena at the nanoscale.
