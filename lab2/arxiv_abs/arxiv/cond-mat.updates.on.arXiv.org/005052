Excitations of impurity complexes in semiconductors can not only provide a route to fill the terahertz
gap in optical technologies, but can also connect local quantum bits to scale up solid-state quantum-computing
devices. However, taking into account both the interactions among electrons/holes, and the host
band structures, is challenging. Here we combine first-principles band-structure calculations
with quantum-chemistry methodology to evaluate the ground and excited states of a pair of phosphorous
donors in silicon within s single framework. We use a broken-symmetry Hartree-Fock approach, followed
by a time-dependent Hartree-Fock method to compute the excited states. Our Hamiltonian for each
valley includes an anisotropic kinetic energy term, which splits the 2p_0 and 2p_+- transitions
of isolated donors by ~4 meV, in good agreement with experiments. Our single-valley calculations
show the optical response is a strong function of the optical polarisation, and suggest the use of
valley polarisation to control optics and reduce oscillations in exchange interactions. When
taking into account all valleys, including valley-orbital interactions, we find a gap opens between
the 1s to 2p transition and low-energy charge-transfer states within 1s manifolds (which become
optically allowed because of inter-donor interactions). In contrast to the single-valley case,
we find charge-transfer excited states also in the triplet sector, thanks to the valley degrees
of freedom. These states have a qualitatively correct energy as compared with the previous experiments;
additionally, we predict new excitations below 20 meV that have not been analysed previously. A
statistical average of nearest-neighbour pairs at different separations suggests that THz radiation
could be used to excite pairs spin-selectively. Our approach can readily be extended to other donors
and to other semiconducting hosts.
