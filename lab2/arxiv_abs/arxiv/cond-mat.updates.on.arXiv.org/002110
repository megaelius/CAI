We report a detailed analysis of the energy spectra, second- and high-order structure functions
of velocity differences in superfluid $^4$He counterflow turbulence, measured in a wide range
of temperatures and heat fluxes. We show that the one-dimensional energy spectrum $E_{xz} (k_y)$
(averaged over the $xz$-plane, parallel to the channel wall), directly measured as a function of
the wall-normal wave-vector $k_y$, gives more detailed information on the energy distribution
over scales than the corresponding second-order structure function $S_{2}(\delta_y)$. In particular,
we discover two intervals of $k_y$ with different apparent exponents: $E_{xz} (k_y)\propto k_y^{-m_C}$
for $k\lesssim k_\times$ and $E_{xz} (k_y)\propto k_y^{-m_F}$ for $k\gtrsim k_\times$. Here
$k_\times$ denotes wavenumber that separate scales with relatively strong (for $k\lesssim k_\times$)
and relatively weak (for $k\gtrsim k_\times$) coupling between the normal-fluid and superfluid
velocity components. We interpret these $k$-ranges as cascade-dominated and mutual friction-dominated
intervals, respectively. General behavior of the experimental spectra $E_{xz}(k_y)$ agree well
with the predicted spectra [Phys. Rev. B 97, 214513 (2018)]. Analysis of the $n$-th order structure
functions statistics shows that in the energy-containing interval the statistics of counterflow
turbulence is close to Gaussian, similar to the classical hydrodynamic turbulence. In the cascade-
and mutual friction-dominated intervals we found some modest enhancement of intermittency with
respect of its level in classical turbulence. However, at small scales, the intermittency becomes
much stronger than in the classical turbulence.
