The Green's function~(GF) of two localized magnetic moments embedded in the electron gas is calculated
exactly. The electrons are treated in the effective mass approximation and the magnetic moments
are coupled with electrons by a delta-like~$s-d$ interaction. The resulting GF is obtained by the
exact summation of the Born series using a generalization of the method developed by Slater-Koster
and Ziman to non-commuting spin operators with the use of the Woodbury identities. The exact GF crucially
depends on the value of the one-electron GF at the origin, denoted as~$g_0$. The Born series is convergent
only if~$g_0$ is finite, which holds for electrons in parabolic energy bands in~$1D$, but not in~$2D$
and~$3D$. In the general case, the exact GF includes nonlinear combination of localized spins operators.
A method of calculating matrix elements of these operators is given. For spins~$S_a=S_b = 1/2$ the
exact GF is expressed as a linear combination of components of~$\hS_a, \hS_b$, and the exact range
function~${\cal J}(r)$ is obtained as a double integral over analytical expression. For electron
energy~$E=0$ and~$J g_0/2 = 2$ or~$J g_0/2=-2/3$ the range function and GF are singular. Poles of
GF occur in the vicinities of singularity points and the resulting energies of bound states are calculated.
There are three regimes of~$J$. For small $J$ the range function resembles RKKY one: it has the same
period~$\pi/k_F$, the same decay character and a slightly different amplitude, usually within
a few percent. This regime occurs for most frequently in the nature. For~$|J|$ comparable to~$|g_0|^{-1}$
the exact range function differs qualitatively from RKKY one,. For large $|J|$ the exact range function
oscillates with the same period and power-like decay as the usual RKKY function but it has much lower
amplitude decaying with growing~$|J|$.
