Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) has yielded significant insight on the electronic structure
of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials. STS directly measures a fundamental and
directly calculable quantity: the single particle density of states (SPDOS). Due to experimental
setup limitations, however, STS has been unable to explore 2D materials in ultra-high magnetic
fields where electron-electron interactions can drastically change the SPDOS. Recent developments
in the assembly of heterostructures composed of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride have enabled
a device-based alternative to potentially overcome these roadblocks. Thus far, however, these
nascent efforts are incomplete in analyzing and understanding tunneling spectra and have yet to
explore graphene at high magnetic fields. Here we report an experiment at magnetic fields up to 18
T that uses graphene tunneling field effect transistors (TFETs) to establish a clear benchmark
for measurement and analysis of graphene planar tunneling spectroscopy. We acquire gate tunable
tunneling spectra of graphene and then use these data and electrostatic arguments to develop a systematic
analysis scheme. This analysis reveals that TFET devices directly probe electronic structure
features near and far from the Fermi level. In particular, our study yields identification of the
Dirac point and numerous Landau levels as they fill and empty with charge via application of a gate
voltage. Our work demonstrates that TFET devices are a viable platform for directly probing the
electronic structure of graphene and other 2D materials in high magnetic fields, where novel electronic
states emerge.
