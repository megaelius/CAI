The color code is both an interesting example of an exactly solved topologically ordered phase of
matter and also among the most promising candidate models to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation
with minimal resource overhead. The contributions of this work are threefold. First of all, we build
upon the abstract theory of boundaries and domain walls of topological phases of matter to comprehensively
catalog the objects realizable in color codes. Together with our classification we also provide
lattice representations of these objects which include three new types of boundaries as well as
a generating set for all 72 color code twist defects. Our work thus provides an explicit toy model
that will help to better understand the abstract theory of domain walls. Secondly, we discover a
number of interesting new applications of the cataloged objects for quantum information protocols.
These include improved methods for performing quantum computations by code deformation, a new
four-qubit error-detecting code, as well as families of new quantum error-correcting codes we
call stellated color codes, which encode logical qubits at the same distance as the next best color
code, but using approximately half the number of physical qubits. To the best of our knowledge, our
new topological codes have the highest encoding rate of local stabilizer codes with bounded-weight
stabilizers in two dimensions. Finally, we show how the boundaries and twist defects of the color
code are represented by multiple copies of other phases. Indeed, in addition to the well studied
comparison between the color code and two copies of the surface code, we also compare the color code
to two copies of the three-fermion model. In particular, we find that this analogy offers a very clear
lens through which we can view the symmetries of the color code which gives rise to its multitude of
domain walls.
