Monolithic realization of metallic 1T and semiconducting 2H polymorphic phases makes MoS2 a potential
candidate for future microelectronic circuits. Though co-existence of these phases has been reported,
a method for engineering a stable 1T phase in a scalable manner, compatible with the standard device
fabrication schemes is yet to emerge. In addition, there are no comprehensive studies on the electrical
properties of the 1T phase. In this manuscript, we demonstrate a controllable and scalable 2H to
1T phase engineering technique for MoS2 using Ar + H2 microwave plasma. The technique enables us
to realize 1T MoS2 starting from the 2H phase of arbitrary thickness and area. Our method allows lithographically
defining continuous 1T regions in a 2H sample. The 1T samples withstand aging in excess of a few weeks
in ambience and show a thermal stability up to 300 C, making it suitable for standard device fabrication
techniques. We conduct both two-probe and four-probe electrical transport measurements on devices
with back-gated field effect transistor geometry in a temperature range of 4 K to 300 K. The 1T samples
exhibit Ohmic current-voltage characteristics in all temperature ranges without any dependence
to the gate voltage, a signature indicative of metallic state. The sheet resistance of our 1T MoS2
sample is considerably lower than that of 2H samples while the carrier concentration of the 1T sample
is few orders of magnitude higher than that of the 2H samples. In addition, our samples show negligible
temperature dependence of resistance from 4 K to 300 K ruling out any hoping mediated or activated
electrical transport.
