We report on key signal contributions in photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) of semiconductors
at photon energies below the bandgap energy and show how to extract the actual absorption properties
from the measurement data. To this end, we establish a rigorous computation scheme for the deflection
signal including semi-analytic raytracing to analyze the underlying physical effects. The computation
takes into account linear and nonlinear absorption processes affecting the refractive index and
thus leading to a deflection of the probe beam. We find that beside the linear mirage effect, nonlinear
absorption mechanisms make a substantial contribution to the signal for strongly focussed pump
beams and sample materials with high two-photon absorption coefficients. For example, the measured
quadratic absorption contribution exceeds 5% at a pump beam intensity of about ${1.3}\times{10^{5}}\;{W}/{cm^{2}}$
in Si and at ${5}\times{10^{4}}\;{W}/{cm^{2}}$ in GaAs. In addition, our method also includes
thermal expansion effects as well as spatial gradients of the attenuation properties. We demonstrate
that these effects result in an additional deflection contribution which substantially depends
on the distance of the photodetector from the readout point. This distance dependent contribution
enhances the surface related PDS signal up to two orders of magnitude and may be misinterpreted as
surface absorption if not corrected in the analysis of the measurement data. We verify these findings
by PDS measurements on crystalline silicon at a wavelength of 1550 nm and provide guidelines how
to extract the actual attenuation coefficient from the PDS signal.
