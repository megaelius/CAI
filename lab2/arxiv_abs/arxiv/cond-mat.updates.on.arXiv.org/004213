The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the conduction of the nervous impulse through the axon, whose
membrane's electric response can be described employing multiple connected electric circuits
containing capacitors, voltage sources, and conductances. These conductances depend on previous
depolarizing membrane voltages, which can be identified with a memory resistive element called
memristor. Inspired by the recent quantization of the memristor, a simplified Hodgkin-Huxley
model including a single ion channel has been studied in the quantum regime. Here, we study the quantization
of the complete Hodgkin-Huxley model, accounting for all three ion channels, and introduce a quantum
source, together with an output waveguide as the connection to a subsequent neuron. Our system consists
of two memristors and one resistor, describing potassium, sodium, and chloride ion channel conductances,
respectively, and a capacitor to account for the axon's membrane capacitance. We study the behavior
of both ion channel conductivities and the circuit voltage, and we compare the results with those
of the single channel, for a given quantum state of the source. It is remarkable that, in opposition
to the single-channel model, we are able to reproduce the voltage spike in an adiabatic regime. Arguing
that the circuit voltage is a quantum variable, we find a purely quantum-mechanical contribution
in the system voltage's second moment. This work represents a complete study of the Hodgkin-Huxley
model in the quantum regime, establishing a recipe for constructing quantum neuron networks with
quantum state inputs. This paves the way for advances in hardware-based neuromorphic quantum computing,
as well as quantum machine learning, which might be more efficient resource-wise.
