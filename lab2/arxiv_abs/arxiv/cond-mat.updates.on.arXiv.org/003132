The honeycomb Kitaev spin model provides a quantum spin liquid in the ground state, where the spin
excitations are fractionalized into itinerant and localized Majorana fermions; the former spectrum
has a broad continuum ranging up to a high energy, while the latter has a sharp peak at a low energy.
Despite tremendous efforts, it remains elusive to clearly identify these distinct Majorana excitations
in experiments. Here we show their manifestation in the time evolution after quenching the magnetic
field, by using the time-dependent Majorana mean-field theory for both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
Kitaev models. We find that the transient spin dynamics from the quantum spin liquid states is qualitatively
different from the conventional spin precessions by the quench from the high-field forced-ferromagnetic
state. We obtain peculiar time evolutions with distinct time scales, i.e., short-time decay of
high-energy components associated with the itinerant Majorana excitations, and long-lived excitations
at a low energy by the localized ones. These peculiar behaviors are caused by the energy transfer
between the two Majorana quasiparticles after the field quench. Moreover, we find that the Majorana
semimetal with the point nodes in equilibrium turns into a Majorana metal with the transient "Fermi
surfaces" by the energy transfer. In particular, for the quench from the intermediate-field quantum
spin liquid in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model, the Fermi surfaces change their topology in
the time evolution, which is regarded as a dynamical version of the Majorana "Lifshitz transition".
Our results unveil that the real-time dynamics provides another route to not only the identification
of the fractional Majorana excitations in candidate materials of Kitaev magnets but also unprecedented
quantum phases that cannot be stabilized as the equilibrium states.
