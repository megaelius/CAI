Polar metals are rare because free carriers in metals screen electrostatic potential and eliminate
internal dipoles. Degenerate doped ferroelectrics may create an approximate polar metallic phase.
We use first-principles calculations to investigate $n$-doped LiNbO$_3$-type oxides (LiNbO$_3$
as the prototype) and compare to widely studied perovskite oxides (BaTiO$_3$ as the prototype).
In the rigid-band approximation, substantial polar displacements in $n$-doped LiNbO$_3$ persist
even at 0.3 $e$/f.u. ($\simeq$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$), while polar displacements in $n$-doped BaTiO$_3$
quickly get suppressed and completely vanish at 0.1 $e$/f.u. Furthermore, in $n$-doped LiNbO$_3$,
Li-O displacements decay more slowly than Nb-O displacements, while in $n$-doped BaTiO$_3$, Ba-O
and Ti-O displacements decay approximately at the same rate. Supercell calculations that use oxygen
vacancies as electron donors support the main results from the rigid-band approximation and provide
more detailed charge distributions. Substantial cation displacements are observed throughout
LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$($\delta = 4.2\%$), while cation displacements in BaTiO$_{3-\delta}$($\delta
= 4.2\%$) are almost completely suppressed. We find that conduction electrons in LiNbO$_{3-\delta}$
are not as uniformly distributed as in BaTiO$_{3-\delta}$, implying that the rigid-band approximation
should be used with caution in simulating electron doped LiNbO$_3$-type oxides. Our work shows
that polar distortions and conduction can coexist in a wide range of electron concentration in $n$-doped
LiNbO$_3$, which is a practical approach to generating an approximate polar metallic phase. Combining
doped ferroelectrics and doped semiconductors may create new functions for devices.
