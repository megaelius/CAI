Monopole-like electrostatic interactions are ubiquitous in biology and condensed matter, but
they are often screened by counter-ions and cannot be switched from attractive to repulsive. In
colloidal science, where the prime goal is to develop colloidal particles that mimic and exceed
the diversity and length-scales of atomic and molecular assembly, electrostatically charged
particles cannot change the sign of their surface charge or transform from monopoles to higher-order
multipoles. In liquid-crystal colloids, elastic interactions between particles arise to minimize
the free energy associated with elastic distortions in the long-range alignment of rod-like molecules
around the particles. In dipolar, quadrupolar and hexadecapolar nematic colloids, the symmetries
of such elastic distortions mimic both electrostatic multipoles and the outmost occupied electron
shells of atoms. Electric and magnetic switching, spontaneous transformations and optical control
of elastic multipoles, as well as their interactions with topological defects and surface boundary
conditions, have been demonstrated in such colloids. However, it has long been understood that
elastic monopoles should relax to uniform or higher-order multipole states because of the elastic
torques that they induce. Here we develop nematic colloids with strong elastic monopole moments
and with elastic torques balanced by optical torques exerted by ambient light. We demonstrate the
monopole-to-quadrupole reconfiguration of these colloidal particles by unstructured light,
which resembles the driving of atoms between the ground state and various excited states. We show
that the sign of the elastic monopoles can be switched, and that like-charged monopoles attract
whereas oppositely charged ones repel, unlike in electrostatics. We also demonstrate the out-of-equilibrium
dynamic assembly of these colloidal particles.
