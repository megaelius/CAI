Quantum quenches to or near criticality give rise to the phenomenon of \textit{aging}, manifested
by glassy-like dynamics at short times and far from equilibrium. The recent surge of interest in
the dynamics of quantum many-body systems has rejuvenated interest in this phenomenon. Motivated
by the ubiquitous long-range interactions in emerging experimental platforms, it is vital to study
quantum aging in such settings. In this work, we investigate the dynamical universality and aging
in the $d$-dimensional $O(N)$ model with the long-range coupling $1/x^{d+\sigma}$ and in the mean-field
limit $N\to\infty$ that allows an exact treatment. An immediate consequence of long-range coupling
is the emergence of nonlinear light cones. We focus on the correlation and response functions, and
identify a rich scaling behavior depending on how the corresponding space-time positions are located
relative to each other, via a \textit{local light cone}, and to the time of the quench via a global
\textit{quench light cone}. We determine the initial-slip exponent that governs the short-time
dependence of two-point functions. We highlight the new qualitative features of aging due to the
long-range coupling, in particular in the region outside the light cones. As an important consequence
of long-range coupling, the correlation function decays as $1/x^{d+\sigma}$ outside the quench
light cone while increasing polynomially with the total time after quench. This is while, for short
time differences, the two-time response function "equilibrates" at \textit{all} distances even
outside this light cone. Our analytic findings are in excellent agreement with exact numerics,
and provide a useful benchmark for modern experimental platforms with long-range interactions.
