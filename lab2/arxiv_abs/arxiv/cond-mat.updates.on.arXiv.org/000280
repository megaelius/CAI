Due to the great sensitivity of spin orderings to the local atomic environment, systems based on
magnetic materials provide especially fruitful examples of how symmetry influences structure
and dynamics. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction is a well known example that appears
in several contexts. The essential idea is that interactions governing spin ordering may create
non-collinear spin configurations when inversion symmetry is absent. This may occur locally,
in the case of isolated atomic scale defects, but can also occur globally if the crystal structure
is such that inversion is not an allowed symmetry. For example, the breaking of chiral symmetry in
magnetic thin films and multilayers can lead to the appearance of an anisotropic exchange interaction
of the DM form. In ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, DM interactions can
stabilize exotic spin textures and introduce new low order terms into the dispersion of fundamental
spin wave excitations. There are practical benefits as well: high velocities for current driven
magnetic domain boundary walls $-$ of interest for a number of applications $-$ result from modified
domain wall profiles with enhanced response to spin Hall generated torques. Because these DM related
effects are still largely based on prediction and conjecture, a challenging problem is to detect
and measure the strength of the DM interactions in these ferromagnetic metals. To address this challenge,
we examine how the DM interaction leads to nonreciprocal effects in spin angular momentum transport
via magnons. We suggest that these interesting and unique features should allow DM interactions
to be measured in metallic multilayers by experimental study of low energy spin wave excitations
in magnetic wires, dots, and domain walls.
