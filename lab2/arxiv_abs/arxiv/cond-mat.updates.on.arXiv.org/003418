We study an extended Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper model with simultaneous modulation of hopping, on-site
potential, and $p$-wave superconducting pairing. For the case of commensurate modulation of $\beta
= 1/2$ it is shown that the model hosts four different types of topological states: adiabatic cycles
can be defined which pump particles, two types of Majorana fermions, or Cooper pairs. In the incommensurate
case we calculate the phase diagram of the model in several regions. We characterize the phases by
calculating the mean inverse participation ratio and perform multi-fractal analysis. In addition,
we characterize whether the phases found are topologically trivial or not. We find an interesting
critical extended phase when incommensurate hopping modulation is present. The rise between the
inverse participation ratio in regions separating localized and extended states is gradual, rather
than sharp. When, in addition, the on-site potential modulation is incommensurate, we find several
sharp rises and falls in the inverse participation ratio. In these two cases all different phases
exhibit topological edge states. For the commensurate case we calculate the evolution of the Hofstadter
butterfly and the band Chern numbers upon variation of the pairing parameter for zero and finite
on-site potential. For zero on-site potential the butterflies are triangular-like near zero pairing,
when gap-closure occurs, they are square-like, and hexagonal-like for larger pairing, but with
the Chern numbers switched compared to the triangular case. For the finite case gaps at quarter and
three-quarters filling close and lead to a switch in Chern numbers.
