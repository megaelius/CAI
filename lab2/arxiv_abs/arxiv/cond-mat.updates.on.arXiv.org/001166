Understanding radiative transfer in random media like micro/nanoporous and particulate materials,
allows people to manipulate the scattering and absorption of radiation, as well as opens new possibilities
in applications such as imaging through turbid media, photovoltaics and radiative cooling. A strong-backscattering
phase function, i.e., a negative scattering asymmetry parameter $g$, is of great interest which
can possibly achieve unusual radiative transport phenomena, for instance, Anderson localization
of light. Based on the multipole expansion of Foldy-Lax equations and quasicrystalline approximation
(QCA), we have rigorously derived analytical expressions for effective propagation constant
and scattering phase function for a random system containing dual-dipolar particles, by taking
the effect of structural correlations into account. Here we demonstrate that by utilizing structural
correlations and the second Kerker condition for a disordered medium composed of randomly distributed
silicon nanoparticles, a strongly negative scattering asymmetry factor ($g\sim-0.5$) for multiple
light scattering can be realized in the near-infrared. As concentration of scattering particles
rises, the backscattering is also enhanced. Moreover, we show that in this circumstance, transport
mean free path is largely reduced and even smaller than that predicted by independent scattering
approximation. We further explored the dependent scattering effects, including the modification
of electric and magnetic dipole excitations and far-field interference effect, both induced by
the structural correlations, for volume fraction of particles up to $f_v\sim0.25$. Our results
have profound implications in harnessing micro/nanoscale radiative transfer through random
media.
