We experimentally study the impact response of concentrated suspensions of cornstarch and water.
We hypothesize that the dynamically jammed region that propagates ahead of the impactor is responsible
for the strong stress response to impact when it spans between solid boundaries. Using surface imaging
and particle tracking at the boundary opposite the impactor, we observed that a visible structure
and particle flow at the boundary occur with a delay after impact. We show the delay time is about the
same time as the the strong stress response, confirming that the strong stress response is a consequence
of this dynamically jammed structure spanning between the impactor and a solid boundary. We also
elaborate on the structure of the dynamically jammed region once it spans from the impactor to a solid
boundary. We observed particle flow in the outer part of the dynamically jammed region at the bottom
boundary, with a net transverse displacement of up to about 5\% of the impactor displacement, which
indicates shear. Direct imaging to the surface of the outer part of the dynamically jammed region
reveals a change in surface structure that appears the same as the result of dilation in other cornstarch
suspensions, and cracks like a solid. This shear and dilation are in contrast to the dynamically
jammed region as it propagates through the bulk, where it is argued to exhibit no shear or decrease
in packing fraction. These observations suggest the dynamically jammed structure can temporarily
support stress like a soil or dense granular material along a network of frictional contacts between
the impactor and solid boundary.
