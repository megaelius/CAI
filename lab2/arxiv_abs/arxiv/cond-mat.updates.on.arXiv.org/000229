We analyze the transformation from insulator to metal induced by thermal fluctuations within the
Falicov-Kimball model. Using the Dynamic Mean Field Theory (DMFT) formalism on the Bethe lattice
we find rigorously the temperature dependent Density of States ($DOS$) at half filling in the limit
of high dimensions. At zero temperature (T=0) the system is ordered to form the checkerboard pattern
and the $DOS$ has the gap $\Delta$ at the Fermi level $\varepsilon_F=0$, which is proportional to
the interaction constant $U$. With an increase of $T$ the $DOS$ evolves in various ways that depend
on $U$. For $U>U_{cr}$ the gap persists for any $T$ (then $\Delta >0$), so the system is always
an insulator. However, if $U < U_{cr}$, two additional subbands develop inside the gap. They
become wider with increasing $T$ and at a certain $U$-dependent temperature $T_{MI}$ they join
with each other at $\varepsilon_F$. Since above $T_{MI}$ the $DOS$ is positive at $\varepsilon_F$,
we interpret $T_{MI}$ as the transformation temperature from insulator to metal. It appears, that
$T_{MI}$ approaches the order-disorder phase transition temperature $T_{O-DO}$ when $U$ is close
to 0 or $ U_{cr}$, but $T_{MI}$ is substantially lower than $T_{O-DO}$ for intermediate values of
$U$. Having calculated the temperature dependent $DOS$ we study thermodynamic properties of the
system starting from its free energy $F$. Then we find how the order parameter $d$ and the gap $\Delta
$ change with $T$ and we construct the phase diagram in the variables $T$ and $U$, where we display
regions of stability of four different phases: ordered insulator, ordered metal, disordered insulator
and disordered metal. Finally, we use a low temperature expansion to demonstrate the existence
of a nonzero DOS at a characteristic value of U on a general bipartite lattice.
