We study the effect of restoration force caused by the limited size of a small metallic nanoparticle
(MNP) on its linear response to the electric field of incident light. In a semi-classical phenomenological
Drude-like model for small MNP, we consider restoration force caused by the displacement of conduction
electrons with respect to the ionic background taking into account a free coefficient as a function
of diameter of NP in the force term obtained by the idealistic Thomson model in order to adjust the
classical approach. All important mechanisms of the energy dissipation such as electron-electron,
electron-phonon and electron-NP surface scatterings and radiation are included in the model.
In addition a correction term added to the damping factor of mentioned mechanisms in order to rectify
the deficiencies of theoretical approaches. To determine the free parameters, the experimental
data of extinction cross section of gold NPs with different sizes doped in the glass are used and a
good agreement between experimental data and our model is observed. It is shown that by decreasing
the diameter of NP, the restoration force becomes larger and classical confinement effect becomes
more dominant in the interaction. According to experimental data, the best fitted parameter for
the coefficient of restoration force is a third order negative powers function of diameter. The
fitted function for the correction damping factor is proportional to the inverse squared wavelength
and third order power series of NP diameter. The real and imaginary parts of permittivity for different
sizes of gold NPs are presented and it is seen that the imaginary part is more sensitive to the diameter
variations. Increase in the NP diameter causes increase in the real part of permittivity and decrease
in the imaginary part.
