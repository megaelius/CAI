Subband occupancy (i.e. the number of occupied subbands or energy levels in the semiconductor)
is a key physical parameter characterizing the topological properties of superconductor-semiconductor
hybrid systems in the context of the search for non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. We theoretically
study the subband occupation of semiconductor nanowire devices as function of the applied gate
potential, the semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) work function difference, and the surface
charge density by solving self-consistently the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equations for the conduction
electrons of the semiconductor nanowire. Realistic surface charge densities, which are responsible
for band bending, are shown to significantly increase the number of occupied subbands, making it
difficult or impossible to reach a regime where only a few subbands are occupied. We also show that
the energy separation between subbands is significantly reduced in the regime of many occupied
subbands, with highly detrimental consequences for the realization and observation of robust
Majorana zero modes. As a consequence, the requirements for the realization of robust topological
superconductivity and Majorana zero modes should include a low value of the chemical potential,
consistent with the occupation of only a few subbands. Finally, we show that the local density of
states on the exposed nanowire facets provides a powerful tool for identifying a regime with many
occupied subbands and is capable of providing additional critical information regarding the feasibility
of Majorana physics in semiconductor-superconductor devices. In our work, we address both InAs/Al
and InSb/Al superconductor-nanowire hybrid systems of current experimental interest.
