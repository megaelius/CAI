Coplanar model states for applications of the coupled cluster method (CCM) to problems in quantum
magnetism are those in which all spins lie in a plane, whereas three-dimensional (3D) model states
are, by contrast, non-coplanar ones in which all the spins do not lie in any single plane. Here we extend
the CCM to non-coplanar / 3D model states and we present results for three cases: (a) the spin-half
one-dimensional Ising ferromagnet in an applied transverse magnetic field (as an exactly solvable
test model to use as a yardstick for the viability and accuracy of our new methodology); (b) the spin-half
triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in the presence of an external magnetic field;
and (c) the spin-$S$ triangular-lattice {\it XXZ} antiferromagnet in the presence of an external
magnetic field, for the cases $\frac{1}{2} \leq S \leq5 $. For 3D model states the sets of algebraic
CCM equations for the ket- and bra-state correlation coefficients become complex-valued, but
ground-state expectation values of all physical observables are manifestly real numbers, as required.
Excellent correspondence is seen with the results of other methods, where they exist, for these
systems. CCM results demonstrate explicitly that coplanar ordering is favoured over non-coplanar
ordering for the triangular-lattice spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet at all values of the
applied external magnetic field, whereas for the anisotropic {\it XXZ} model non-coplanar ordering
can be favoured in some regions of the parameter space. Specifically, we present a precise determination
of the boundary (i.e., the critical value of the {\it XXZ} anisotropy parameter $\Delta$) between
a 3D ground state and a coplanar ground state for the {\it XXZ} model for values for the external magnetic
field near to saturation, for values of the spin quantum number $S \leq 5$.
