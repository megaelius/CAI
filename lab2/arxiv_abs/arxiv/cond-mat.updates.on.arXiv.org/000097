Two level systems that can be reliably controlled and measured hold promise in both metrology and
as qubits for quantum information science (QIS). When prepared in a superposition of two states
and allowed to evolve freely, the state of the system precesses with a frequency proportional to
the splitting between the states. In QIS,this precession forms the basis for universal control
of the qubit,and in metrology the frequency of the precession provides a sensitive measurement
of the splitting. However, on a timescale of the coherence time, $T_2$, the qubit loses its quantum
information due to interactions with its noisy environment, causing qubit oscillations to decay
and setting a limit on the fidelity of quantum control and the precision of qubit-based measurements.
Understanding how the qubit couples to its environment and the dynamics of the noise in the environment
are therefore key to effective QIS experiments and metrology. Here we show measurements of the level
splitting and dephasing due to voltage noise of a GaAs singlet-triplet qubit during exchange oscillations.
Using free evolution and Hahn echo experiments we probe the low frequency and high frequency environmental
fluctuations, respectively. The measured fluctuations at high frequencies are small, allowing
the qubit to be used as a charge sensor with a sensitivity of $2 \times 10^{-8} e/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$,
two orders of magnitude better than the quantum limit for an RF single electron transistor (RF-SET).
We find that the dephasing is due to non-Markovian voltage fluctuations in both regimes and exhibits
an unexpected temperature dependence. Based on these measurements we provide recommendations
for improving $T_2$ in future experiments, allowing for higher fidelity operations and improved
charge sensitivity.
