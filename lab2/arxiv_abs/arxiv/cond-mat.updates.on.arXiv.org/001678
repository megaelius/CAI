Layered Li(Ni,Mn,Co,)O$_2$ (NMC) presents an intriguing ternary alloy design space for the optimization
of performance as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries. Here, we present a high fidelity computational
search of the ternary phase diagram with an emphasis on high-Ni containing compositional phases.
This is done through the use of density functional theory training data fed into a reduced order model
Hamiltonian that accounts for effective electronic and spin interactions of neighboring transition
metal atoms at various lengths in a background of fixed lithium and oxygen atoms. This model can then
be solved to include finite temperature thermodynamics into a convex hull analysis. We also provide
a method to propagate the uncertainty at every level of the analysis to the final prediction of thermodynamically
favorable compositional phases thus providing a quantitative measure of confidence for each prediction
made. Due to the complexity of the three component system, as well as the intrinsic error of density
functional theory, we argue that this propagation of uncertainty, particularly the uncertainty
due to exchange-correlation functional choice is necessary to have reliable and interpretable
results. With our final result, we recover the prediction of already known phases such as LiNi$_{0.33}$Mn$_{0.33}$Co$_{0.33}$O$_2$
(111) and LiNi$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.1}$Co$_{0.1}$O$_2$ (811) in exact proportion while finding other
proportions very close to the experimentally claimed LiNi$_{0.6}$Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$O$_2$
(622) and LiNi$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.3}$Co$_{0.2}$O$_2$ (532) phases, and overall predict a total of
37 phases with reasonable confidence and 69 more phases with a lower level of confidence. Through
our analysis, we also can identify the phases with the highest average operational voltage at a given
Co composition.
