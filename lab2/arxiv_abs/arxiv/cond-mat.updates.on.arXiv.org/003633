We introduce higher-order topological Dirac superconductor (HOTDSC) as a new gapless topological
phase of matter in three dimensions, which extends the notion of Dirac phase to a higher-order topological
version. Topologically distinct from the traditional topological superconductors and known
Dirac superconductors, a HOTDSC features helical Majorana hinge modes between adjacent surfaces,
which are direct consequences of the symmetry-protected higher-order band topology manifesting
in the system. Specifically, we show that rotational, spatial inversion, and time-reversal symmetries
together protect the coexistence of bulk Dirac nodes and hinge Majorana modes in a seamless way.
We define a set of topological indices that fully characterizes the HOTDSC. We further show that
a practical way to realize the HOTDSC phase is to introduce unconventional odd-parity pairing to
a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal while preserving the necessary symmetries. As a concrete
demonstration of our idea, we construct a corresponding minimal lattice model for HOTDSC obeying
the symmetry constraints. Our model exhibits the expected topological invariants in the bulk and
the defining spectroscopic features on an open geometry, as we explicitly verify both analytically
and numerically. Remarkably, the HOTDSC phase offers an example of a higher-order topological
quantum critical point, which enables realizations of various higher-order topological phases
under different symmetry-breaking patterns. In particular, by breaking the inversion symmetry
of a HOTDSC, we arrive at a higher-order Weyl superconductor, which is yet another new gapless topological
state that exhibits hybrid higher-order topology.
