The second law of thermodynamics tells us which state transformations are so statistically unlikely
that they are effectively forbidden. Its original formulation, due to Clausius, states that "Heat
can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring
at the same time". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles interacting; however,
we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics in the regime where we only have a small number
of particles interacting with a heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime?
Here, we find that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second law for microscopic
systems takes on a very di?erent form than it does at the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one
constraint on what state transformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In
particular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional one, and show that
they can never increase. We further find that there are three regimes which determine which family
of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one
can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from
a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are not only
relevant for small systems, but also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range
interactions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making precise the definition
of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take on a simple form with the first law defining
the class of thermal operations, the zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory
is nontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our generalised free energies.
