Floppy Networks (FNs) play a prominent role in soft condensed matter, from polymers and rubber to
biomolecules, glasses, and granular matterials. They provide valuable insight into the origin
of anomalous mechanical and thermal properties of these systems. Here, we demonstrate how the very
same concept of FN emerges in the context of a family of crystalline ceramic materials, an open framework
ionic solids, which can be conceptualized as Coulomb floppy networks. One remarkable example is
ScF$_3$ which exhibits a number of unusual properties, including quantum structural phase transition
near ambient pressure and negative thermal expansion (NTE). Yet other examples are found among
diverse families of topical materials, from pure silicon to superconducting cuprates and iron
pnictides, whose anomalous vibrational and structural properties and still ill-understood.
Our microscopic theory traces these effects to a FN-like crystalline architecture, which is stabilized
by the net electrostatic repulsion that plays the role similar to an osmotic pressure in a polymeric
gel. NTE in this type of inorganic solids has essentially the same origin as in gels and rubber. For
ScF$_3$, our theory provides an accurate quantitative description of NTE, compressibility, and
structural phase diagram, all in excellent agreement with multiple experiments. The entropic
stabilization of criticality explains the observed phase behavior, while significant entropic
contribution to elasticity accounts for the marked discrepancy between the experimentally observed
compressibility and the ab initio calculations. Our results explain a range of exotic properties
of topical open framework solids and pave the way to engineering new classes of self-assembled metamaterials
with tunable structural and thermomechanical properties based on the concept of Coulomb FNs.
