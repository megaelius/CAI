We investigate the excited state electronic structure of the model phase transition system In/Si(111)
using femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with an XUV
laser source at 500 kHz . Excited state band mapping is used to characterize the normally unoccupied
electronic structure above the Fermi level in both structural phases of indium nanowires on Si(111):
the metallic (4x1) and the gapped (8x2) phases. The extracted band positions are compared with the
band structure calculated using density functional theory (DFT) within both the LDA and GW approximations.
While good overall agreement is found between the GW calculated band structure and experiment,
deviations in specific momentum regions may indicate the importance of excitonic effects not accounted
for at this level of approximation. To probe the dynamics of these excited states, their momentum-resolved
transient population dynamics are extracted. The transient intensities are then simulated by
a spectral function determined by a state population employing a transient elevated electronic
temperature as determined experimentally. This allows the momentum-resolved population dynamics
to be quantitatively reproduced, revealing important insights into the transfer of energy from
the electronic system to the lattice. In particular, a comparison between the magnitude and relaxation
time of the transient electronic temperature observed by trARPES with those of the lattice as probed
in previous ultrafast electron diffraction studies imply a highly non-thermal phonon distribution
at the surface following photo-excitation. This suggests the energy from the excited electronic
system is initially transferred to high energy optical phonon modes followed by cooling and thermalization
of the photo-excited system by much slower phonon-phonon coupling.
