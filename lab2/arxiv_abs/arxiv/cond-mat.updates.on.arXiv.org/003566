The Hubbard model is the simplest model that is believed to exhibit superconductivity arising from
purely repulsive interactions, and has been extensively applied to explore a variety of unconventional
superconducting systems. Here we study the evolution of the leading superconducting instabilities
of the single-orbital Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice as a function of onsite
Coulomb repulsion $U$ and band filling by calculating the irreducible particle-particle scattering
vertex obtained from dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations, and compare the results
to both perturbative Kohn-Luttinger (KL) theory as well as the widely used random phase approximation
(RPA) spin-fluctuation pairing scheme. Near half-filling we find remarkable agreement of the
hierarchy of the leading pairing states between these three methods, implying adiabatic continuity
between weak- and strong-coupling pairing solutions of the Hubbard model. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave
instability is robust to increasing $U$ near half-filling as expected. Away from half filling,
the predictions of KL and RPA at small $U$ for transitions to other pair states agree with DCA at intermediate
$U$ as well as recent diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. RPA results fail only in the very dilute
limit, where it yields a $d_{xy}$ ground state instead of a $p$-wave state established by diagrammatic
Monte Carlo and low-order perturbative methods, as well as our DCA calculations. We discuss the
origins of this discrepancy, highlighting the crucial role of the vertex corrections neglected
in the RPA approach. Overall, comparison of the various methods over the entire phase diagram strongly
suggests a smooth crossover of the superconducting interaction generated by local Hubbard interactions
between weak and strong coupling.
