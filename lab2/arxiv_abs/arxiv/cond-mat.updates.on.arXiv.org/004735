The discovery of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in bulk metallic antiferromagnets (AFMs) motivates
the search of the same phenomenon in two-dimensional (2D) systems, where a quantized anomalous
Hall conductance can in principle be observed. Here, we present experiments on micro-fabricated
devices based on Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, a layered AFM that was recently found to exhibit AHE in bulk
crystals below the N\'eel temperature T$_N$ = 29 K. Transport measurements reveal a pronounced
resistivity anisotropy, indicating that upon lowering temperature the electronic coupling between
individual atomic layers is increasingly suppressed. The experiments also show an extremely large
anomalous Hall conductivity of approximately 400 S/cm, more than one order of magnitude larger
than in the bulk, which demonstrates the importance of studying the AHE in small exfoliated crystals,
less affected by crystalline defects. Interestingly, the corresponding anomalous Hall conductance,
when normalized to the number of contributing atomic planes, is $\sim \, 0.6 \; e^2/h$ per layer,
approaching the value expected for the quantized anomalous Hall effect. The observed strong anisotropy
of transport and the very large anomalous Hall conductance per layer make the properties of Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$
compatible with the presence of partially filled topologically non-trivial 2D bands originating
from the magnetic superstructure of the antiferromagnetic state. Isolating atomically thin layers
of this material and controlling their charge density may therefore provide a viable route to reveal
the occurrence of the quantized AHE in a 2D AFM.
