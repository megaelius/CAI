Ferromagnetic spintronics has been a main focus as it offers non-volatile memory and logic applications
through current-induced spin-transfer torques. Enabling wider applications of such magnetic
devices requires a lower switching current for a smaller cell while keeping the thermal stability
of magnetic cells for non-volatility. As the cell size reduces, however, it becomes extremely difficult
to meet this requirement with ferromagnets because spin-transfer torque for ferromagnets is a
surface torque due to rapid spin dephasing, leading to the 1/ferromagnet-thickness dependence
of the spin-torque efficiency. Requirement of a larger switching current for a thicker and thus
more thermally stable ferromagnetic cell is the fundamental obstacle for high-density non-volatile
applications with ferromagnets. Theories predicted that antiferromagnets have a long spin coherence
length due to the staggered spin order on an atomic scale, thereby resolving the above fundamental
limitation. Despite several spin-torque experiments on antiferromagnets and ferrimagnetic
alloys, this prediction has remained unexplored. Here we report a long spin coherence length and
associated bulk-like-torque characteristic in an antiferromagnetically coupled ferrimagnetic
multilayer. We find that a transverse spin current can pass through > 10 nm-thick ferrimagnetic
Co/Tb multilayers whereas it is entirely absorbed by 1 nm-thick ferromagnetic Co/Ni multilayer.
We also find that the switching efficiency of Co/Tb multilayers partially reflects a bulk-like-torque
characteristic as it increases with the ferrimagnet-thickness up to 8 nm and then decreases, in
clear contrast to 1/thickness-dependence of Co/Ni multilayers. Our results on antiferromagnetically
coupled systems will invigorate researches towards energy-efficient spintronic technologies.
