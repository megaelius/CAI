We present a comprehensive study of various electromagnetic wave propagation phenomena in a ferromagnetic
bulk Rashba conductor from the perspective of quantum mechanical transport. In this system, both
the space inversion and time reversal symmetries are broken, as characterized by the Rashba field
$\alpha$ and magnetization $M$, respectively. First, we present a general phenomenological analysis
of electromagnetic wave propagation in media based on the dielectric tensor. Then, we calculate
the microscopic electromagnetic response of the current and spin of conduction electrons subjected
to $ \alpha$ and $M$, based on linear response theory and the Green's function method. Firstly, it
is found that a large $\alpha$ enhances the anisotropic properties of the system and enlarges the
frequency range in which the electromagnetic waves have hyperbolic dispersion surfaces and exhibit
unusual propagations known as negative refraction and backward waves. Secondly, we consider the
electromagnetic cross-correlation effects on the wave propagation. These effects stem from the
lack of space inversion symmetry and yield $q$-linear off-diagonal components in the dielectric
tensor. This induces a Rashba-induced birefringence. In the presence of $M$, there arises an anomalous
Hall effect and the dielectric tensor acquires off-diagonal components linear in $M$. These components
yield the Faraday effect and the Cotton-Mouton effect. When $\alpha$ and $M$ are noncollinear,
$M$- and $q$-induced optical phenomena, nonreciprocal directional dichroism is possible. In
these nonreciprocal optical phenomena, a "toroidal moment," $\alpha\times M$, and a "quadrupole
moment," $\alpha_i M_j + \alpha_j M_i$, play central roles. These phenomena are strongly enhanced
at the spin-split transition edge in the electron band.
