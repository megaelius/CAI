Recent first-principles electron-phonon scattering calculations of heavily-doped semiconductors
suggest that a simple DOS scattering model, wherein the electronic scattering rates are assumed
to be proportional to the density-of-states, better approximates the rigorous scattering characteristics
compared to the commonly used constant relaxation-time and constant mean-free-path approximations.
This work investigates how the thermoelectric properties predicted with the DOS model compare
to the other two scattering models, using three analytical electron dispersions (parabolic band
in 3D/2D/1D, Kane band in 3D/2D/1D, and ring-shaped quartic band in 2D). Our findings show that the
scattering models can lead to significant differences, and can disagree about whether certain
band structures can provide benefits. A constant relaxation-time is found to always be optimistic
compared to a constant mean-free-path, while the DOS scattering model shows no such clear trend.
Notably, the 1D parabolic band and 2D quartic band exhibit the highest power factors with the DOS
model, resulting from a rapid decrease in density-of-states, and thus scattering - suggesting
a possible strategy for improved thermoelectrics based on engineering band structures with sharp/discontinuous
drops in density-of-states. The DOS scattering approximation also suggests that searches for
materials with a delta function-like DOS (as a proxy to the transport distribution) or converged
bands may yield limited benefits, due to the increase in scattering. This work highlights the importance
of simple and accurate scattering models when rigorous ab-initio scattering calculations are
not feasible.
