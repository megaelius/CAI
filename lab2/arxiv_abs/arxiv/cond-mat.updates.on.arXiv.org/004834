Low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling heat engines are able to operate with a small temperature
difference between low-temperature heat reservoirs that exist in our daily lives, and thus they
are considered to be an important sustainable energy technology. The author recently proposed
a nonlinear dynamics model of an LTD kinematic Stirling heat engine to study the rotational mechanism
of the engine [Y. Izumida, EPL \textbf{121}, 50004 (2018)]. It was shown that the rotational motion
of the engine is described by a stable limit cycle of the dynamical equations, and disappears via
a homoclinic bifurcation, with the temperature difference being the bifurcation parameter. This
paper presents our study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics analysis of this engine model. Therefore,
we introduce a load torque into the model so that the engine does work against the load torque under
a given temperature difference. We demonstrate that the engine begins to rotate by exhibiting a
homoclinic bifurcation at the bifurcation point with respect to the load torque. It is found that
there is a quasi-linear response regime sufficiently far from the bifurcation points where the
averaged fluxes show a linear dependency on the external forces. Significantly, it is found that
the response coefficients of the quasi-linear relations are symmetric, which is similar to Onsager
symmetry in linear irreversible thermodynamics. Based on these relations, we formulate the maximum
efficiency of the engine. We also elucidate that the symmetry of the quasi-linear response coefficients
emerges by reflecting the (anti-)reciprocity of the Onsager kinetic coefficients in the relaxation
dynamics of the engine in the vicinity of an equilibrium state. The present study is expected to pave
the way for developing nonequilibrium thermodynamics of autonomous heat engines described as
a nonlinear dynamical system.
