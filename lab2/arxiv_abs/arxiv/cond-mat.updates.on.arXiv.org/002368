We compute the effects of electronic interactions on gapless spin-3/2 excitations that in a noninteracting
system emerge at a bi-quadratic touching of Kramers degenerate valence and conduction bands, known
as Luttinger semimetal. This model can describe the low-energy physics of HgTe, gray-Sn, 227 pyrochlore
iridates and half-Heuslers. For the sake of concreteness we only consider the short-range components
of the Coulomb interaction. By combining mean-field analysis with a renormalization group (RG)
calculation, we construct multiple cuts of the global phase diagram of interacting spin-3/2 fermions
at zero and finite temperature and chemical doping. Such phase diagrams display a rich confluence
of competing orders, among which rotational symmetry breaking nematic insulators and time reversal
symmetry breaking magnetic orders are the prominent excitonic phases. We also show that even repulsive
interactions can be conducive for both s-wave and d-wave pairings. The reconstructed band structure
inside the ordered phases allows us to organize them according to the energy (entropy) gain in the
following (reverse) order: s-wave pairing, nematic phases, magnetic orders and d-wave pairings,
at zero chemical doping. But, the paired states are always energetically superior over the excitonic
ones for finite doping. The phase diagrams obtained from the RG analysis show that an ordered phase
with higher energy (entropy) gain is realized at low (high) temperature. In addition, we establish
a "selection rule" between the interaction channels and the resulting ordered phases, suggesting
that repulsive interactions in the magnetic (nematic) channels are conducive for the nucleation
of d-wave (s-wave) pairing. The proposed methodology can shed light on the global phase diagram
of other strongly interacting multi-band systems, such as doped Dirac semimetal, topological
insulators and the like.
