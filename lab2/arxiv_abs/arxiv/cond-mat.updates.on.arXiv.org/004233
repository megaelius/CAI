We introduce and describe the multiconfigurational time-depenent Hartree for indistinguishable
particles (MCTDH-X) software. This powerful tool allows the investigation of ground state properties
and dynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems in different spatial dimensions. The MCTDH-X
software is a set of programs and scripts to compute, analyze, and visualize solutions for the time-dependent
and time-independent many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation for indistinguishable quantum particles.
As the MCTDH-X software represents a general solver for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, it is applicable
to a wide range of problems in the fields of atomic, optical, molecular physics as well as condensed
matter systems. In particular, it can be used to study light-matter interactions, correlated dynamics
of electrons, as well as some aspects related to quantum information and computing. The MCTDH-X
software solves a set of non-linear coupled working equations based on the application of the variational
principle to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. These equations are obtained by using an ansatz for
the many-body wavefunction that is a time-dependent expansion in a set of time-dependent many-body
basis states. The time-dependence of the basis set enables MCTDH-X to deal with quantum dynamics
at a superior accuracy as compared to, for instance, exact diagonalization approaches. Herein,
we give an introduction to the MCTDH-X software via an easy-to-follow tutorial with a focus on accessibility.
We use the double well to illustrate the fermionization of bosonic particles, the crystallization
of fermionic particles, characteristics of the superfluid and Mott-insulator quantum phases
in Hubbard models, and even dynamical quantum phase transitions. Our tutorial guides the potential
user to apply the MCTDH-X software also to more complex systems.
