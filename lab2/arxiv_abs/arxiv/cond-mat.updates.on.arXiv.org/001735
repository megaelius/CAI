We theoretically investigate the Cooper-pair symmetry to be realized in hole-doped monolayer
MoS$_2$ by solving linearized BCS gap equations on the three-orbital attractive Hubbard-like
model in the presence of the atomic spin-orbit coupling. In hole-doped monolayer MoS$_2$, both
spin-orbit coupling and the multi-orbital effects are more prominent than those of electron-doped
system. Near the valence band edge, the Fermi surfaces are composed of three different types of hole
pockets, namely, one mainly consisting of the almost spin-degenerate $|d_{z^{2}}\rangle$ orbital
near $\Gamma$ point, and the others of the spin-split upper and lower bands near ${\rm K}$ and ${\rm
K}'$ points arising from the $|d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\rangle$ and $|d_{xy}\rangle$ orbitals. The number
of relevant Fermi pockets increases with increase of the doping. At very low doping, the upper split
bands of $|d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\rangle$ and $|d_{xy}\rangle$ are concerned, yielding extremely
low $T_{\rm c}$ due to small density of states of the split bands. For further doping, the conventional
spin-singlet state (SS) appears in the $\Gamma$ pocket, which has a mixture of the spin-triplet
(orbital-singlet) (ST-OS) and spin-singlet (orbital-triplet) (SS-OT) states in the K and K$'$
pockets. The ratio of the mixture depends on the relative strength of the interactions, and the sign
of the exchange interactions. Moderately strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions even lead
to the pairing state with the dominant ST-OS state over the conventional SS one. With these observations,
we expect that the fascinating pairing with relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ emerges at high doping that
involves all the three Fermi pockets.
