Small-wavevector excitations in Coulomb-interacting systems can be decomposed into the high-energy
collective longitudinal plasmon and the low-energy single-electron excitations. At the critical
wavevector and corresponding frequency where the plasmon branch merges with the single-electron
excitation region, the collective energy of the plasmon dissipates into single electron-hole
excitations. The jellium model provides a reasonable description of the electron-energy-loss
spectrum (EELS) of metals close to the free-electron limit. The random phase approximation (RPA)
is exact in the high-density limit but can capture the plasmonic dispersion reasonably even for
densities with rs > 1. RPA and all beyond-RPA methods investigated here, result in a wrong infinite
plasmon lifetime for a wavevector smaller than the critical one where the plasmon dispersion curve
runs into particle-hole excitations. Exchange-correlation kernel corrections to RPA modify
the plasmon dispersion curve. There is however a large difference in the construction and form of
the kernels investigated earlier. Our current work introduces recent model exchange-only and
exchange-correlation kernels and discusses the relevance of some exact constraints in the construction
of the kernel. We show that, because the plasmon dispersion samples a range of wavevectors smaller
than the range sampled by the correlation energy, different kernels can make a strong difference
for the correlation energy and a weak difference for the plasmon dispersion. This work completes
our understanding about the plasmon dispersion in realistic metals, such as Cs, where a negative
plasmon dispersion has been observed. We find only positive plasmon dispersion in jellium at the
density for Cs.
