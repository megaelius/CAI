Formation of vortex rings around moving spherical objects in superfluid He-4 at 0 K is modeled by
time-dependent density functional theory. The simulations provide detailed information of the
microscopic events that lead to vortex ring emission through characteristic observables such
as liquid current circulation, drag force, and hydrodynamic mass. A series of simulations were
performed to determine velocity thresholds for the onset of dissipation as a function of the sphere
radius up to 1.8 nm and at external pressures of zero and 1 bar. The threshold was observed to decrease
with the sphere radius and increase with pressure thus showing that the onset of dissipation does
not involve roton emission events (Landau critical velocity), but rather vortex emission (Feynman
critical velocity), which is also confirmed by the observed periodic response of the hydrodynamic
observables as well as visualization of the liquid current circulation. An empirical model, which
considers the ratio between the boundary layer kinetic and vortex ring formation energies, is presented
for extrapolating the current results to larger length scales. The calculated critical velocity
value at zero pressure for a sphere that mimics an electron bubble is in good agreement with the previous
experimental observations at low temperatures. The stability of the system against symmetry breaking
was linked to its ability to excite quantized Kelvin waves around the vortex rings during the vortex
shedding process. At high vortex ring emission rates, the downstream dynamics showed complex vortex
ring fission and reconnection events that appear similar to those seen in previous Gross-Pitaevskii
theory-based calculations, and which mark the onset of turbulent behavior.
