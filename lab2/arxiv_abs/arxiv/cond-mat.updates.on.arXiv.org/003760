Synthesizing unconventional alloys remains challenging owing to seamless interactions between
kinetics and thermodynamics. High entropy alloys (HEAs), for example, draw a fundamentally new
concept to enable exploring unknown regions in phase diagrams. The exploration, however, is hindered
by traditional metallurgies based on liquid-solid transformation. Vapor-solid transformation
that is permissible on pressure-temperature phase diagrams, offers the most kinetically efficient
pathway to form any desired alloy (e.g., HEA). Here, we report that a technique called "sparking
mashups", which involves a rapidly quenched vapor source and induces unrestricted mixing for alloying
55 distinct types of ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable compositions. Unlike the
precursor feed in wet chemistry, a microseconds-long oscillatory spark controls the vapour composition,
which is eventually retained in the alloy NPs. The resulting NPs range from binary to HEAs with marked
thermal stability at room temperature. We show that a nanosize-effect ensures such thermal stability
and mimics the role of mixing entropy in HEAs. This discovery contradicts the traditional "smaller
is less stable" view while enabling the elemental combinations that have never been alloyed to date.
We even break the miscibility limits by mixing bulk-immiscible systems in alloy NPs. As powerful
examples, we demonstrate the alloy NPs as both high-performance fuel-cell catalysts and building
blocks for three-dimensional (3D) nanoprinting to construct HEA nanostructure arrays of various
architectures and compositions. Our results form the basis of new rules for guiding HEA-NP synthesis
and advancing catalysis and 3D printing to new frontiers.
