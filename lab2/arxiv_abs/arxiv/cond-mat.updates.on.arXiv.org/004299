The strategy of band convergence of multi-valley conduction bands or multi-peak valence bands
has been successfully used to understand or help researchers design more efficient thermoelectric
materials, or guide the discovery of new thermoelectric materials. However, the phonon-assisted
intervalley scatterings due to multiple band degeneracy are generally neglected in the traditional
context of band-convergence stategy, owning to computational simplifications or experimental
difficulties. However, the electron-phonon coupling may play the key role in determining the electronic
part of thermoelectric figure of merits. In this work, by using first-principles method, we investigated
in details the (thermo)electric properties of monolayer $\beta$- and $\alpha$-antimonene (Sb)
considering full mode-resolved electron-phonon interactions. Our calculations reveal strong
intervally-scattering between the nearly degenerate electronic valley states in both $\beta$-
and $\alpha$-Sb, and the deformation potential approximation based on the coupling between valley
electrons and longitudinal acoustic phonons fails to describe accurately the electron-phonon
scattering and thermoelectric transport properties in these multi-valley non-polar systems.
As a result, by considering full electron-phonon interactions based on the rigid-band approximation,
the maximum value of thermoelectric figure of merit $zT$ at room temperature reduces to 0.37 in $\beta$-Sb,
by a factor of 5.7 comparing to what is predicted based on the constant relaxiation-time approximation.
Our work shows that the band convergence of multi-valley is less beneficial in materials where the
intervalley scattering is strong.
