The waiting time distribution (WTD) is a common tool for analysing discrete stochastic processes
in classical and quantum systems. However, there are many physical examples where the dynamics
is continuous and only approximately discrete, or where it is favourable to discuss the dynamics
on a discretized and a continuous level in parallel. An example is the hindered motion of particles
through potential landscapes with barriers. In the present paper we propose a consistent generalisation
of the WTD from the discrete case to situations where the particles perform continuous barrier-crossing
characterised by a finite duration. To this end, we introduce a recipe to calculate the WTD from the
Fokker-Planck/Smoluchowski equation. In contrast to the closely related first passage time distribution
(FPTD), which is frequently used to describe continuous processes, the WTD contains information
about the direction of motion. As an application, we consider the paradigmatic example of an overdamped
particle diffusing through a washboard potential. To verify the approach and to elucidate its numerical
implications, we compare the WTD defined via the Smoluchowski equation with data from direct simulation
of the underlying Langevin equation and find full consistency provided that the jumps in the Langevin
approach are defined properly. Moreover, for sufficiently large energy barriers, the WTD defined
via the Smoluchowski equation becomes consistent with that resulting from the analytical solution
of a (two-state) master equation model for the short-time dynamics developed previous by us [PRE
86, 061135 (2012)]. Thus, our approach "interpolates" between these two types of stochastic motion.
We illustrate our approach for both symmetric systems and systems under constant force.
