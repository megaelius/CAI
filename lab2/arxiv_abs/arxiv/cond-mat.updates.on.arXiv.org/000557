In the search for novel organic charge transfer salts with variable charge transfer degree we study
the effects of two modifications to the recently synthesized donor-acceptor Tetramethoxypyrene
(TMP)-Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). One is of chemical nature by substituting the acceptor
TCNQ molecules by F4TCNQ molecules. The second consists in simulating the application of uniaxial
pressure along the stacking axis of the system. In order to test the chemical substitution, we have
grown single crystals of TMP-F4TCNQ and analyzed its electronic structure via electronic transport
measurements, ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations and UV/VIS/IR absorption
spectroscopy. This system shows an almost ideal geometrical overlap of nearly planar molecules
alternately stacked (mixed stack) and this arrangement is echoed by a semiconductor-like transport
behavior with an increased conductivity along the stacking direction. This is in contrast to TMP-TCNQ
which shows a less pronounced anisotropy and a smaller conductivity response. Our bandstructure
calculations confirm the one-dimensional behavior of TMP-F4TCNQ with pro- nounced dispersion
only along the stacking axis. Infrared measurements illustrating the CN vibration frequency shift
in F4TCNQ suggest however no improvement on the degree of charge transfer in TMP-F4TCNQ with respect
to TMP-TCNQ. In both complexes about 0.1 is transferred from TMP to the acceptor. Concerning the
pressure effect, our DFT calculations on designed TMP-TCNQ and TMP-F4TCNQ structures under different
pressure conditions show that application of uniaxial pressure along the stacking axis of TMP-TCNQ
may be the route to follow in order to obtain a much more pronounced charge transfer.
