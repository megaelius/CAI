Motivated by recent experiments, we study the relaxation dynamics and thermalization in the one-dimensional
Bose-Hubbard model induced by a global interaction quench. Specifically, we start from an initial
state that has exactly one boson per site and is the ground state of a system with infinitely strong
repulsive interactions at unit filling. Using exact diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization
group method, we compute the time dependence of such observables as the multiple occupancy and the
momentum distribution function. Typically, the relaxation to stationary values occurs over just
a few tunneling times. The stationary values are identical to the so-called diagonal ensemble on
the system sizes accessible to our numerical methods and we further observe that the micro-canonical
ensemble describes the steady state of many observables reasonably well for small and intermediate
interaction strength. The expectation values of observables in the canonical ensemble agree quantitatively
with the time averages obtained from the quench at small interaction strengths, and qualitatively
provide a good description of steady-state values even in parameter regimes where the micro-canonical
ensemble is not applicable due to finite-size effects. We discuss our numerical results in the framework
of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, we also observe that the diagonal and the
canonical ensemble are practically identical for our initial conditions already on the level of
their respective energy distributions for small interaction strengths. Finally, we discuss implications
of our results for the interpretation of a recent sudden expansion experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett.
110, 205301 (2013)], in which the same interaction quench was realized.
