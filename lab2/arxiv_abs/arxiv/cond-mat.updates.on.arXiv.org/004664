Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been attracting significant interest
due to a range of properties, such as layer-dependent inversion symmetry, valley-contrasted Berry
curvatures, and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Of particular interest is niobium diselenide
(NbSe2), whose superconducting state in few-layer samples is profoundly affected by an unusual
type of SOC called Ising SOC. Combined with the reduced dimensionality, the latter stabilizes the
superconducting state against magnetic fields up to ~35 T and could lead to other exotic properties
such as nodal and crystalline topological superconductivity. Here, we report transport measurements
of few-layer NbSe$_2$ under in-plane external magnetic fields, revealing an unexpected two-fold
rotational symmetry of the superconducting state. In contrast to the three-fold symmetry of the
lattice, we observe that the magnetoresistance and critical field exhibit a two-fold oscillation
with respect to an applied in-plane magnetic field. We find similar two-fold oscillations deep
inside the superconducting state in differential conductance measurements on NbSe$_2$/CrBr$_3$
superconductor-magnet junctions. In both cases, the anisotropy vanishes in the normal state,
demonstrating that it is an intrinsic property of the superconducting phase. We attribute the behavior
to the mixing between two closely competing pairing instabilities, namely, the conventional s-wave
instability typical of bulk NbSe$_2$ and an unconventional d- or p-wave channel that emerges in
few-layer NbSe2. Our results thus demonstrate the unconventional character of the pairing interaction
in a few-layer TMD, opening a new avenue to search for exotic superconductivity in this family of
2D materials.
