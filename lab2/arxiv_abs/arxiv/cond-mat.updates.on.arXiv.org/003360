We performed a theoretical investigation of the structural and electronic properties of (i) pristine,
and (ii) superlattice structures of borophene. In (i), by combining first-principles calculations,
based on the density functional theory (DFT), and simulations of the X-ray Absorption Near-Edge
Structure (XANES) we present a comprehensive picture connecting the atomic arrangement of borophene
and the X-ray absorption spectra. Once we have characterized the electronic properties of the pristine
systems, we next examined the electronic confinement effects in 2D borophene superlattices (BSLs)
[(ii)]. Here, the BSL structures were made by attaching laterally two different structural phases
of borophene. The energetic stability, and the electronic properties of those BSLs were examined
based on total energy DFT calculations. We find a highly anisotropic electronic structure, characterized
by the electronic confinement effects, and the formation of metallic channels along the superlattices.
Combining DFT and the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism, we investigate the electronic transport
properties in the BSLs. Our results of the transmission probability reveal that the electronic
transport is ruled by {\pi} or a combination of {\pi} and {\sigma} transmission channels, depending
on the atomic arrangement and periodicity of the superlattices. Finally we show that there is huge
magnification on the directional dependence of the electronic transport properties in BSLs, in
comparision with the pristine borophene phase. Those findings indicate that BSLs are quite interesting
systems in order to design conductive nanoribbons in a 2D platform.
