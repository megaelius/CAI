The compound EuCo{2-y}As2 with the tetragonal ThCr2Si2 structure is known to contain Eu{+2} ions
with spin S = 7/2 that order below a temperature TN = 47 K into an antiferromagnetic (AFM) proper helical
structure with the ordered moments aligned in the tetragonal ab plane, perpendicular to the helix
axis along the c axis, with no contribution from the Co atoms. Here we carry out a detailed investigation
of the properties of single crystals. Enhanced ordered and effective moments of the Eu spins are
found in most of our crystals. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the enhanced moments
arise from polarization of the d bands, as occurs in ferromagnetic Gd metal. Electrical resistivity
measurements indicate metallic behavior. The low-field in-plane magnetic susceptibilities
chi{ab}(T < TN) for several crystals are reported that are fitted well by unified molecular field
theory (MFT), and the Eu-Eu exchange interactions Jij are extracted from the fits. High-field magnetization
M data for magnetic fields H||ab reveal what appears to be a first-order spin-flop transition followed
at higher field by a second-order metamagnetic transition of unknown origin, and then by another
second-order transition to the paramagnetic (PM) state. For H||c, the magnetization shows only
a second-order transition from the canted AFM to the PM state, as expected. The critical fields for
the AFM to PM transition are in approximate agreement with the predictions of MFT. Heat capacity
Cp measurements in zero and high H are reported. Phase diagrams for H||c and H||ab versus T are constructed
from the high-field M(H,T) and Cp(H,T) measurements. The magnetic part Cmag(T, H = 0) of Cp(T, H =
0) is extracted and is fitted rather well below TN by MFT, although dynamic short-range AFM order
is apparent in Cmag(T) up to about 70 K, where the molar entropy attains its high-T limit of R ln8.
