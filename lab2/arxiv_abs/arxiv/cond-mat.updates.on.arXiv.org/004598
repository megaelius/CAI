Versatile quantum modes emerge for plasmon describing the collective oscillations of free electrons
in metallic nanoparticles when the particle sizes are greatly reduced. Rather than traditional
nanoscale study, the understanding of quantum plasmon desires extremal atomic control of the nanoparticles,
calling for size dependent plasmon measurement over a series of nanoparticles with atomically
adjustable atom number over several orders of magnitude. Here we report the N dependent plasmonic
evolution of atomically size selected gold particles with N= 100 70000 using electron energy loss
(EEL) spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The EEL mapping assigns a feature
at 2.7 eV as the bulk plasmon and another at 2.4 eV as surface plasmon, which evolution reveals three
regimes. When N decreases from 70000 to 887, the bulk plasmon stays unchanged while the surface plasmon
exhibits a slight red shift from 2.4 to 2.3 eV. It can be understood by the dominance of classical plasmon
physics and electron boundary scattering induced retardation. When N further decreases from 887
to 300, the bulk plasmon disappears totally and the surface plasmon shows a steady blueshift, which
indicates that the quantum confinement emerges and modifies the intraband transition. When N 100
300, the plasmon is split to three fine features, which is attributed to superimposed single electron
transitions between the quantized molecular like energy level by the time dependent density functional
theory calculations. The surface plasmon's excitation ratio has a scaling law with an exponential
dependence on N ( N^0.669), essentially the square of the radius. A unified evolution picture from
the classical to quantum, molecular plasmon is thus demonstrated.
