It is shown that: in the case when two parameters of the Van der Waals equation of state are defined
from the critical temperature and pressure the exact parametrical solution of the equations of
the liquid-vapor phase equilibrium of the Van der Waals fluid quantitatively describes the experimental
dependencies of the saturated pressure of argon on the temperature and reduced vapor density, and
it gives the quantitative description of the temperature dependencies of the reduced densities
near critical point. When the parameters are defined from the critical pressure and density the
parametric solution describes quantitatively the experimental dependencies of the saturated
pressure of argon on the density and reduced temperature, it can describe qualitatively the dependencies
of the vapor and liquid densities on the reduced temperature, and it gives the quantitative description
of the dependencies of the densities on the reduced temperature near critical point. If the parameters
are defined from the critical temperature and density then the exact solution describes quantitatively
the experimental dependencies of the reduced saturated pressure of argon on the density and temperature,
it describes qualitatively the temperature dependencies of the vapor and liquid densities of argon,
and it gives the quantitative description of the temperature dependencies of the vapor and liquid
densities near critical point. It is also shown that the Van der Waals equation of state describes
quantitatively the reference experimental PVT- data for the gas and supercritical fluid states
for the under-critical densities of argon, the dependencies of the saturation pressure on the temperature
and vapor density, and the dependence of the vapor density of argon on temperature if the parameters
are defined from the critical pressure and temperature.
