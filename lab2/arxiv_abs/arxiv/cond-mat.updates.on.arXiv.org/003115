We show that the large orbital degeneracy inherent in Moir\'e heterostructures naturally gives
rise to a `high-$T_c$' like phase diagram with a chiral twist - wherein an exotic $\textit{quantum
anomalous Hall}$ insulator phase is flanked by chiral $d+id$ superconducting domes. Specifically,
we analyze repulsively interacting fermions on hexagonal (triangular or honeycomb) lattices
near Van Hove filling, with an ${\rm SU}(N_f)$ flavor degeneracy. This model is inspired by recent
experiments on graphene Moir\'e heterostructures. At this point, a nested Fermi surface and divergent
density of states give rise to strong ($\ln^2$) instabilities to correlated phases, the competition
between which can be controllably addressed through a combination of weak coupling parquet renormalization
group and Landau-Ginzburg analysis. For $N_f=2$ (i.e. spin degeneracy only) it is known that chiral
$d+id$ superconductivity is the unambiguously leading weak coupling instability. Here we show
that $N_f\geq4$ leads to a richer (but still unambiguous and fully controllable) behavior, wherein
at weak coupling the leading instability is to a fully gapped and chiral $\textit{Chern insulator}$,
characterized by a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry and a quantized Hall response.
Upon doping this phase gives way to a chiral $d+id$ superconductor. We further consider deforming
this minimal model by introducing an orbital splitting of the Van Hove singularities, and discuss
the resulting RG flow and phase diagram. Our analysis thus bridges the minimal model and the practical
Moir\'e band structures, thereby providing a transparent picture of how the correlated phases
arise under various circumstances. Meanwhile, a similar analysis on the square lattice predicts
a phase diagram where (for $N_f>2$) a nodal staggered flux phase with `loop current' order gives
way upon doping to a nodal $d$-wave superconductor.
