A well-known drawback of state-of-the-art machine-learning interatomic potentials is their
poor ability to extrapolate beyond the training domain. For small-scale problems with tens to hundreds
of atoms this can be solved by using active learning which is able to select atomic configurations
on which a potential attempts extrapolation and add them to the ab initio-computed training set.
In this sense an active learning algorithm can be viewed as an on-the-fly interpolation of an ab initio
model. For large-scale problems, possibly involving tens of thousands of atoms, this is not feasible
because one cannot afford even a single density functional theory computation with such a large
number of atoms. This work marks a new milestone toward fully automatic ab initio-accurate large-scale
atomistic simulations. We develop an active learning algorithm that identifies local subregions
of the simulation region where the potential extrapolates. Then the algorithm constructs periodic
configurations out of these local, non-periodic subregions, sufficiently small to be computable
with plane-wave density functional theory codes, in order to obtain accurate ab initio energies.
We benchmark our algorithm on the problem of the screw dislocation motion in bcc tungsten and show
that our algorithm reaches ab initio accuracy, down to typical magnitudes of numerical noise in
DFT codes. We show that our algorithm reproduces material properties such as core structure, Peierls
barrier, and Peierls stress. This unleashes new capabilities for computational materials science
toward applications which have currently been out of scope if approached solely by ab initio methods.
