Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) hosts nearly flat bands with narrow bandwidths of a few meV at certain
{\em magic} twist angles. Here we show that in twisted gapped Dirac material bilayers, or massive
twisted bilayer graphenes (MTBG), isolated nearly flat bands below a threshold bandwidth $W_c$
are expected for continuous small twist angles up to a critical $\theta_c$ depending on the flatness
of the original bands and the interlayer coupling strength. Narrow bandwidths of $W \lesssim $30
meV are expected for $\theta \lesssim 3^{\circ} $ for twisted Dirac materials with intrinsic gaps
of $\sim 2$ eV that finds realization in monolayers of gapped transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDC), silicon carbide (SiC) among others, and even narrower bandwidths in hexagonal boron nitride
(BN) whose gaps are $\sim 5$ eV, while twisted graphene systems with smaller gaps of a few tens of meV,
e.g. due to alignment with hexagonal boron nitride, show vestiges of the magic angles behavior in
the bandwidth evolution. The phase diagram of finite valley Chern numbers of the isolated moire
bands expands with increasing difference between the sublattice selective interlayer tunneling
parameters. The valley contrasting circular dichroism for interband optical transitions is constructive
near $0^{\circ}$ and destructive near $60^{\circ}$ alignments and can be tuned through electric
field and gate driven polarization of the mini-valleys. Combining massive Dirac materials with
various intrinsic gaps, Fermi velocities, interlayer tunneling strengths suggests optimistic
prospects of increasing $\theta_c$ and achieving correlated states with large $U/W$ effective
interaction versus bandwidth ratios.
