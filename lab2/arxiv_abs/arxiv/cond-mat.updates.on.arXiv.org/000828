The classical Heisenberg type spin Hamiltonian is widely used for simulations of finite temperature
properties of magnetic metals often using parameters derived from first principles calculations.
In itinerant electron systems, however, the atomic magnetic moments vary their amplitude with
temperature and the spin Hamiltonian should thus be extended to incorporate the effects of longitudinal
spin fluctuations (LSF). Although the simple phenomenological spin Hamiltonians describing
LSF can be efficiently parameterized in the framework of the constrained Local Spin Density Approximation
(LSDA) and its extensions, the fundamental problem concerning the integration in classical spin
space remains. It is generally unknown how to integrate over the spin amplitude. Two intuitive choices
of integration measure have been used up to date; the Murata-Doniach scalar measure and the simple
three dimensional vector measure. Here we derive the integration measure by considering a classical
limit of the quantum Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian under conditions leading to the proper classical
limit of the commutation relations for all values of the classical spin amplitude and calculate
the corresponding ratio of the number of quantum states. We show, that the number of quantum states
corresponding to the considered classical spin amplitude is proportional to this amplitude and
thus a non-trivial integration measure must be used. We apply our results to the first-principles
simulation of the Curie temperatures of the two canonical ferromagnets bcc Fe and fcc Ni using a single-site
LSF Hamiltonian with parameters calculated in the LSDA framework in the Disordered Local Moment
approximation and a fixed spin moment constraint. In the same framework we compare our results with
those obtained from the scalar and vector measures.
