We use relativistic ab-initio methods combined with model Hamiltonian approaches to analyze the
normal-phase electronic and structural properties of the recently discovered WP superconductor.
Remarkably, the outcomes of such study can be employed to set fundamental connections among WP and
the CrAs and MnP superconductors belonging to the same space group. One of the key features of the
resulting electronic structure is represented by the occurrence of multiple band crossings along
specific high symmetry lines of the Brilloiun zone. In particular, we demonstrate that the eight-fold
band degeneracy obtained along the SR path at (kx,ky)=(Pi,Pi) is due to inversion-time reversal
invariance and a pair of nonsymmorphic symmetries. The presence of multiple degenerate Fermi points
along the SR direction constraints the topology of the Fermi surface, which manifests distinctive
marks when considering its evolution upon band filling variation. If the Fermi level crosses the
bands along the SR line as it happens at the nominal filling of the MnP, these Fermi surfaces are open
or closed Fermi pockets. Moving the relative position of the Fermi level away from the eight-fold
degenerate bands as for the WP and CrAs compounds, the electronic changeover exhibits a simultaneous
modification of the Fermi surface dimensionality and topology. Four two-dimensional (2D) Fermi
surface sheets are centered around the SR line with a corrugated profile along the kz direction.
Moreover, we show that the spin-orbit interaction determines a selective removal of the band degeneracy
and, consequently, a splitting of the quasi 2D Fermi sheets, as it happens in WP. Finally, we comment
on the connections between our results and recent experimental and theoretical proposals about
the triplet superconductivity in this class of compounds.
