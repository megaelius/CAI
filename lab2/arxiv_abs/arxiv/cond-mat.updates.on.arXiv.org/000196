We perform a numerical simulation of mapping of charge confined in quantum dots by the scanning probe
technique. We solve the few-electron Schr\"odinger equation with the exact diagonalization approach
and evaluate the energy maps in function of the probe position. Next, from the energy maps we try to
reproduce the charge density distribution using an integral equation given by the perturbation
theory. The reproduced density maps are confronted with the original ones. The present study covers
two-dimensional quantum dots of various geometries and profiles with the one-dimensional (1D)
quantum dot as a limit case. We concentrate on large quantum dots for which strong electron-electron
correlations appear. For circular dots the correlations lead to formation of Wigner molecules
that in the presence of the tip appear in the laboratory frame. The unperturbed rotationally-symmetric
charge density is surprisingly well reproduced by the mapping. We find in general that the size of
the confined droplet as well as the spatial extent of the charge density maxima is underestimated
for repulsive tip potential and overestimated for the attractive tip. In lower-symmetry quantum
dots the Wigner molecules with single-electron islands nucleate for some electron numbers even
in the absence of the tip. These charge densities are well resolved by the mapping. The single-electron
islands appear in the laboratory frame provided that classical point charge density distribution
is unique, in the 1D limit of confinement in particular. We demonstrate that for electron systems
which possess a few equivalent classical configurations the repulsive probe switches between
the configurations. In consequence the charge density evades mapping by the repulsive probe.
