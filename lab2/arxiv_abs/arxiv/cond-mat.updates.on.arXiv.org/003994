The use of solid-state electrolytes to provide safer, next-generation rechargeable batteries
is becoming more feasible as new materials with greater stability and higher ionic diffusion coefficients
are designed. However, accurate determination of diffusion coefficients in solids is problematic
and reliable calculations are highly sought-after. In this paper we compare diffusion coefficients
calculated using nonequilibrium and equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for
highly diffusive solid-state electrolytes for the first time, to demonstrate the accuracy that
can be obtained. Moreover, we show that ab initio nonequilibrium molecular dynamics can be used
to determine diffusion coefficients when the diffusion is too slow for it to be feasible to obtain
them using ab initio equilibrium simulations. Thereby, using ab initio nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics simulations we are able to obtain accurate estimates of the diffusion coefficients of
Li ions in Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl and Li$_5$PS$_4$Cl$_2$, two promising electrolytes for all-solid-state
batteries. Furthermore, these calculations show that the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions
in Li$_5$PS$_4$Cl$_2$ is higher than many other potential all-solid-state electrolytes, making
it promising for future technologies. The reasons for variation in conductivities determined
using computational and experimental methods are also discussed. It is demonstrated that small
degrees of disorder and vacancies can result in orders of magnitude differences in diffusivities
of Li ions in Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl, and these factors are likely to contribute to inconsistencies observed
in experimentally reported values. Notably, the introduction of Li-vacancies and disorder can
enhance the ionic conductivity of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl.
