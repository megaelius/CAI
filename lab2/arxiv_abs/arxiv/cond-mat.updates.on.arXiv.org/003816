The field of nanofluidics has shown considerable progress over the past decade thanks to key instrumental
advances, leading to the discovery of a number of exotic transport phenomena for fluids and ions
under extreme confinement. Recently, van der Waals assembly of 2D materials allowed fabrication
of artificial channels with angstr\"om-scale precision. This ultimate confinement to the true
molecular scale revealed unforeseen behaviour for both mass and ionic transport. In this work,
we explore pressure-driven streaming in such molecular-size slits and report a new electro-hydrodynamic
effect under coupled pressure and electric force. It takes the form of a transistor-like response
of the pressure induced ionic streaming: an applied bias of a fraction of a volt results in an enhancement
of the streaming mobility by up to 20 times. The gating effect is observed with both graphite and boron
nitride channels but exhibits marked material-dependent features. Our observations are rationalized
by a theoretical framework for the flow dynamics, including the frictional interaction of water,
ions and the confining surfaces as a key ingredient. The material dependence of the voltage modulation
can be traced back to a contrasting molecular friction on graphene and boron nitride. The highly
nonlinear transport under molecular-scale confinement offers new routes to actively control
molecular and ion transport and design elementary building blocks for artificial ionic machinery,
such as ion pumps. Furthermore, it provides a versatile platform to explore electro-mechanical
couplings potentially at play in recently discovered mechanosensitive ionic channels.
