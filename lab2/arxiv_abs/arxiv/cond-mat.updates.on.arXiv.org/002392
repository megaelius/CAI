Metallization of initially insulating VO2 via ionic liquid electrolytes (electrolyte gating)
has recently been a topic of much interest. It is clear that the metallization takes place electrochemically
and there has previously been extensive evidence for the removal of small amounts of oxygen during
ionic liquid gating. Hydrogen intercalation has also been proposed, but the source of the hydrogen
has remained unclear. In this work, solid-state magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy is used to
investigate the thermal metal-insulator transition in VO2, before progressing to catalytically
hydrogenated and electrochemically metallized VO2. Electrochemical metallization of bulk VO2
particles is shown to be associated with intercalation of hydrogen, the degree of which can be measured
with quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy. Possible sources of the hydrogen are explored, and by using
a selectively deuterated ionic liquid, it is revealed that the hydrogenation is due to deprotonation
of the ionic liquid; specifically, for the commonly used dialkylimidazolium based ionic liquids,
it is the "carbene" proton that is responsible. Increasing the temperature of the electrochemistry
is shown to increase the degree of hydrogenation, forming first a less hydrogenated metallic phase
then a more hydrogenated insulating Curie-Weiss paramagnetic phase, both of which were also observed
for catalytically hydrogenated VO2. The NMR results are supported by magnetic susceptibility
measurements, which corroborate the degree of Pauli and Curie-Weiss paramagnetism. NMR spectroscopy
is used to identify the presence of hydrogen in an electrolyte gated thin film of VO2, suggesting
that electrolyte breakdown, proton intercalation and reactions with decomposition products
within the electrolyte should not be ignored when interpreting the electronic and structural changes
observed in electrochemical gating experiments.
