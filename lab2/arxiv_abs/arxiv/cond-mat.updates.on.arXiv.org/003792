Rotating all islands in square artificial spin ice (ASI) uniformly about their centres gives rise
to the recently reported pinwheel ASI. At angles around 45$^\mathrm{o}$, the antiferromagnetic
ordering changes to ferromagnetic and the magnetic configurations of the system exhibit near-degeneracy,
making it particularly sensitive to small perturbations. We investigate through micromagnetic
modelling the influence of dipolar fields produced by physically extended islands in field-driven
magnetisation processes in pinwheel arrays, and compare the results to hysteresis experiments
performed in-situ using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. We find that magnetisation
end-states induce a Heisenberg pseudo-exchange interaction that governs both the inter-island
coupling and the resultant array reversal process. Symmetry reduction gives rise to anisotropies
and array-corner mediated avalanche reversals through a cascade of nearest-neighbour (NN) islands.
The symmetries of the anisotropy axes are related to those of the geometrical array but are misaligned
to the array axes as a result of the correlated interactions between neighbouring islands. The NN
dipolar coupling is reduced by decreasing the island size and, using this property, we track the
transition from the strongly coupled regime towards the pure point dipole one and observe modification
of the ferromagnetic array reversal process. Our results shed light on important aspects of the
interactions in pinwheel ASI, and demonstrate a mechanism by which their properties may be tuned
for use in a range of fundamental research and spintronic applications.
