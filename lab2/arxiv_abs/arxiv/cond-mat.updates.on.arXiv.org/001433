The response of thermodynamic systems perturbed out of an equilibrium steady-state is described
by the reciprocal and the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The so-called fluctuation theorems
extended the study of fluctuations far beyond equilibrium. All these results rely on the crucial
assumption that the observer has complete information about the system. Such a precise control
is difficult to attain, hence the following questions are compelling: Will an observer who has marginal
information be able to perform an effective thermodynamic analysis? Given that such observer will
only establish local equilibrium amidst the whirling of hidden degrees of freedom, by perturbing
the stalling currents will he/she observe equilibrium-like fluctuations? We model the dynamics
of open systems as Markov jump processes on finite networks. We establish that: 1) While marginal
currents do not obey a full-fledged fluctuation relation, there exist effective affinities for
which an integral fluctuation relation holds; 2) Under reasonable assumptions on the parametrization
of the rates, effective and "real" affinities only differ by a constant; 3) At stalling, i.e. where
the marginal currents vanish, a symmetrized fluctuation-dissipation relation holds while reciprocity
does not; 4) There exists a notion of marginal time-reversal that plays a role akin to that played
by time-reversal for complete systems, which restores the fluctuation relation and reciprocity.
The above results hold for configuration-space currents, and for phenomenological currents provided
that certain symmetries of the effective affinities are respected - a condition whose range of validity
we deem the most interesting question left open to future inquiry. Our results are constructive
and operational: we provide an explicit expression for the effective affinities and propose a procedure
to measure them in laboratory.
