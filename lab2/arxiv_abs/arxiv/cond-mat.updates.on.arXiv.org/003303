Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) is a non-destructive, lensless method for 3D-resolved,
nano-scale strain imaging in micro-crystals. A challenge, particularly for new users of the technique,
is accurate mapping of experimental data, collected in the detector reciprocal space coordinate
frame, to more convenient orthogonal coordinates, e.g. attached to the sample. This is particularly
the case since different coordinate conventions are used at every BCDI beamline. The reconstruction
algorithms and mapping scripts composed for individual beamlines are not readily interchangeable.
To overcome this, we introduce a BCDI experiment simulation with a plugin script that converts all
beamline angles to a universal, right-handed coordinate frame, making it possible to condense
any beamline geometry into three rotation matrices. The simulation translates a user-specified
3D complex object to different BCDI-related coordinate frames. It also allows the generation of
synthetic coherent diffraction data that can be inserted into any BCDI reconstruction algorithm
to reconstruct the original user-specified object. Scripts are provided to map from sample space
to detector conjugated space, detector conjugated space to sample space and detector conjugated
space to detector conjugated space for a different refection. This provides the reader with the
basis for a flexible simulation tool kit that is easily adapted to different geometries. We anticipate
that this will find use in the generation of tailor made supports for phasing of challenging data
and exploration of novel geometries or data collection modalities.
