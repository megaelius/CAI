Modern theory of the orbital magnetization is applied to the series of insulating perovskite transition
metal oxides (orthorhombic YTiO$_3$, LaMnO$_3$, and YVO$_3$, as well as monoclinic YVO$_3$),
carrying a net ferromagnetic (FM) moment in the ground state. For these purposes, we use an effective
Hubbard-type model, derived from the first-principles electronic-structure calculations and
describing the behavior of magnetically active states near the Fermi level. The solution of this
model in the mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation with the relativistic spin-orbit coupling
typically gives us a distribution of the local orbital magnetic moments, which are related to the
site-diagonal part of the density matrix $\hat{\cal D}$ by the "standard" expression $\boldsymbol{\mu}^0
= - \mu_{\rm B} \mathrm{Tr} \{ \hat{\textbf{L}} \hat{\cal D} \}$ and which are usually well quenched
by the crystal field. In this work, we evaluate "itinerant" corrections $\Delta \boldsymbol{\cal
M}$ to the net FM moment, suggested by the modern theory. We show that these corrections are small
and in most cases can be neglected. Nevertheless, the most interesting aspect of our analysis is
that, even for these compounds, which are typically regarded as normal Mott insulators, the "itinerant"
corrections reveal a strong $\textbf{k}$-dependence in the reciprocal space, following the behavior
of Chern invariants. Therefore, the small value of $\Delta \boldsymbol{\cal M}$ is the result of
strong cancelation of relatively large contributions, coming from different parts of the Brillouin
zone. We discuss details as well as possible implications of this cancelation, which depends on
the crystal structure as well as the type of the magnetic ground state.
