The presence of charge and spin stripe order in the La2CuO4-based family of superconductors continues
to lead to new insight on the unusual ground state properties of high Tc cuprates. Soon after the discovery
of charge stripe order at T(charge)=65K in Nd3+ co-doped LSCO ($T_{c}\simeq6$~K) [Tranquada et
al., Nature {\bf 375} (1995) 561], Hunt et al. demonstrated that La$_{1.48}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$
and superconducting LSCO with x~1/8 (Tc ~ 30K) share nearly identical NMR anomalies near $T_{charge}$
of the former [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 82} (1999) 4300]. Their inevitable conclusion that LSCO also
undergoes charge order at a comparable temperature became controversial, because diffraction
measurements at the time were unable to detect Bragg peaks associated with charge order. Recent
advances in x-ray diffraction techniques finally led to definitive confirmations of the charge
order Bragg peaks in LSCO with an onset at as high as T(charge)=80K. Meanwhile, improved instrumental
technology has enabled routine NMR measurements that were not feasible two decades ago. Motivated
by these new developments, we revisit the charge order transition of a LSCO single crystal based
on 63Cu NMR techniques. We demonstrate that 63Cu NMR properties of the nuclear spin $I_{z}$ = -1/2
to +1/2 central transition below T(charge) exhibit unprecedentedly strong dependence on the measurement
time scale set by the NMR pulse separation time $\tau$; a new kind of anomalous, very broad wing-like
63Cu NMR signals gradually emerge below T(charge) only for extremely short $\tau \lesssim 4~\mu$s,
while the spectral weight of the normal NMR signals is progressively wiped out. The NMR linewidth
and relaxation rates depend strongly on $\tau$ below T(charge), and their enhancement in the charge
ordered state indicates that charge order turns on strong but inhomogeneous growth of Cu spin-spin
correlations.
