The magnetic and transport properties of Fe-deficient Fe5GeTe2 single crystals (Fe5-xGeTe2 with
x~0.3) were studied and the impact of thermal processing was explored. Quenching crystals from
the growth temperature has been previously shown to produce a metastable state that undergoes a
strongly hysteretic first-order transition upon cooling below ~100K. The first-order transition
impacts the magnetic properties, yielding an enhancement in the Curie temperature T_C from 270
to 310K. In the present work, T_HT ~550K has been identified as the temperature above which metastable
crystals are obtained via quenching. Diffraction experiments reveal a structural change at this
temperature, and significant stacking disorder occurs when samples are slowly cooled through
this temperature range. The transport properties are demonstrated to be similar regardless of
the crystal's thermal history. The scattering of charge carriers appears to be dominated by moments
fluctuating on the Fe(1) sublattice, which remain dynamic down to 100-120K. Maxima in the magnetoresistance
and anomalous Hall resistance are observed near 120K. The Hall and Seebeck coefficients are also
impacted by magnetic ordering on the Fe(1) sublattice. The data suggest that both electrons and
holes contribute to conduction above 120K, but that electrons dominate at lower temperature when
all of the Fe sublattices are magnetically ordered. This study demonstrates a strong coupling of
the magnetism and transport properties in Fe5-xGeTe2 and complements the previous results that
demonstrated strong magnetoelastic coupling as the Fe(1) moments order. The published version
