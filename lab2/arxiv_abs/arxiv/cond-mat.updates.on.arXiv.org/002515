We show that the large orbital degeneracy inherent in Moir\'e heterostructures naturally gives
rise to a 'high-$T_c$' like phase diagram with a chiral twist - wherein an exotic $\textit{quantum
anomalous Hall}$ insulator phase is flanked by chiral $d+id$ superconducting domes. Specifically,
we analyze repulsively interacting fermions on hexagonal (honeycomb or triangular) lattices
near Van Hove filling, with an $\text{SU}(N_f)$ flavor degeneracy. This model is inspired by recent
experiments on graphene Moir\'e heterostructures. At this point, a nested Fermi surface and divergent
density of states give rise to strong ($\ln^2$) instabilities to correlated phases, the competition
between which can be controllably addressed through a combination of weak coupling parquet renormalization
group and Landau-Ginzburg analysis. For $N_f=2$ (i.e. spin degeneracy only) it is known that chiral
$d+id$ superconductivity is the unambiguously leading weak coupling instability. Here we show
that $N_f>2$ leads to a richer (but still unambiguous and fully controllable) behavior, wherein
at weak coupling the leading instability is to a fully gapped and chiral $\textit{Chern insulator}$,
characterized by a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry and a quantized Hall response.
Upon doping this phase gives way to a chiral $d+id$ superconductor. Meanwhile, a similar analysis
on the square lattice predicts a phase diagram in which (for $N_f>2$) a gapped phase with 'loop current'
order gives way upon doping to a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. Our work suggests that graphene
Moir\'e heterostructures are natural platforms for realizing exotic chiral states of correlated
matter.
