We examine the interplay of symmetry and topological order in $2+1$ dimensional topological phases
of matter. We present a definition of the \it topological symmetry \rm group, which characterizes
the symmetry of the emergent topological quantum numbers of a topological phase, and we describe
its relation with the microscopic symmetry of the underlying physical system. We derive a general
framework to characterize and classify symmetry fractionalization in topological phases, including
phases that are non-Abelian and symmetries that permute the quasiparticle types and/or are anti-unitary.
We develop a theory of extrinsic defects (fluxes) associated with elements of the symmetry group,
which provides a general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases derived from
a topological phase of matter $\mathcal{C}$ with symmetry group $G$. The algebraic theory of the
defects, known as a $G$-crossed braided tensor category $\mathcal{C}_{G}^{\times}$, allows
one to compute many properties, such as the number of topologically distinct types of defects associated
with each group element, their fusion rules, quantum dimensions, zero modes, braiding exchange
transformations, a generalized Verlinde formula for the defects, and modular transformations
of the $G$-crossed extensions of topological phases. We also examine the promotion of the global
symmetry to a local gauge invariance, wherein the extrinsic $G$-defects are turned into deconfined
quasiparticle excitations, which results in a different topological phase $(\mathcal{C}_{G}^{\times})^{G}$.
A number of instructive and/or physically relevant examples are studied in detail.
