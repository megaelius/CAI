Mathematical models based on probability density functions (PDF) have been extensively used in
hydrology and subsurface flow problems, to describe the uncertainty in porous media properties
(e.g., permeability modelled as random field). Recently, closer to the spirit of PDF models for
turbulent flows, some approaches have used this statistical viewpoint also in pore-scale transport
processes (fully resolved porous media models). When a concentration field is transported, by
advection and diffusion, in a heterogeneous media, in fact, spatial PDFs can be defined to characterise
local fluctuations and improve or better understand the closures performed by classical upscaling
methods. In the study of hydrodynamical dispersion, for example, PDE-based PDF approach can replace
expensive and noisy Lagrangian simulations (e.g. trajectories of drift-diffusion stochastic
processes). In this work we derive a joint position-velocity Fokker-Planck equation to model the
motion of particles undergoing advection and diffusion in in deterministic or stochastic heterogeneous
velocity fields. After appropriate closure assumptions, this description can help deriving rigorously
stochastic models for the statistics of Lagrangian velocities. This is very important to be able
to characterise the dispersion properties and can, for example, inform velocity evolution processes
in Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) dispersion models. The closure problem that arises when averaging
the Fokker Planck equation shows also interesting similarities with the mixing problem and can
be used to propose alternative closures for anomalous dispersion.
