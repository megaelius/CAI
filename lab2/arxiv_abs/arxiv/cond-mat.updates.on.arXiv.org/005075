Magnetoresistive (xMR) sensors find extensive application in science and industry, replacing
Hall sensors in various low field environments. While there have been some efforts in increasing
the dynamic field range of xMR sensors, Hall sensors remain to dominate high field applications
due to their wide linear range. Using a perpendicular magnetized reference system and an in-plane
free layer allows us to overcome this disadvantage of xMR sensors, and, furthermore, investigate
spin-canting effects in interlayer exchange coupled perpendicular synthetic antiferromagnets
(p-SAF). We created p-SAFs with exchange coupling fields of up to 10 kOe, based on magnetic Co/Pt
multilayer systems. The p-SAFs are either designed as "single" p-SAFs, where two Co/Pt multilayers
are interlayer exchange coupled via a 4 {\AA} thick Ru spacer, or as "double" p-SAFs, where an additional
Co layer is interlayer exchange coupled to the top multilayer. These p-SAFs are used for giant magnetoresistance
(GMR) sensors with wide dynamic field range. By using a p-SAF as the reference system and employing
an in-plane magnetic layer as the GMR's free layer, the linear range can be effectively increased
limited only by the p-SAF's switching fields. Additionally, the magnetic anisotropy of the in-plane
free layer is fully controlled, which allows saturation fields by design. Different configurations
were investigated, ranging from free layer magnetic saturation at lower to far higher fields than
the p-SAF's switching fields. We can show through micromagnetic simulations that certain GMR transfer
curves are dominated by spin-canting effects in the interlayer exchange coupled reference system.
Finally, our simulation results lay out the correlation of the p-SAF's design parameters and its
magnetization reversal behavior.
