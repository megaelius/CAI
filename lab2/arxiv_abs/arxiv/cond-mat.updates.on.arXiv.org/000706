Skyrmions are topologically protected non-collinear magnetic structures. Their stability and
dynamics, arising from their topological character, have made them ideal information carriers
e.g. in racetrack memories. The success of such a memory critically depends on the ability to stabilize
and manipulate skyrmions at low magnetic fields. The driving force for skyrmion formation is the
non-collinear Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction (DMI) originating from spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). It competes with both the nearest neighbour Heisenberg exchange interaction and
the magnetic anisotropy, which favour collinear states. While skyrmion lattices might evolve
at vanishing magnetic fields, the formation of isolated skyrmions in ultra-thin films so far required
the application of an external field which can be as high as several T. Here, we show that isolated
skyrmions in a monolayer (ML) of Co epitaxially grown on a Ru(0001) substrate can be stabilized at
magnetic fields as low as 100 mT. Even though SOC is weak in the 4d element Ru, a homochiral spin spiral
ground state and isolated skyrmions could be detected and laterally resolved using a combination
of tunneling and anisotropic tunneling magnetoresistance effect in spin-sensitive scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm these chiral
magnetic textures, even though the stabilizing DMI interaction is weak. We find that the key factor
is the absence of magnetocristalline anisotropy in this system which enables non-collinear states
to evolve in spite of weak SOC, opening up a wide choice of materials beyond 5d elements.
