In this paper, we investigate the electronic band structure, lattice dynamics and electron-phonon
interaction in $\delta$-NbN, $\varepsilon$-NbN and WC-NbN by performing systematic ab initio
calculations based on DFT-GGA. The calculated electronic band structures show that all three polytypes
are metallic with the Nb $d$-orbital dominated energy bands near the Fermi level ($E_F$). The calculated
phonon dispersion relations of $\delta$-NbN are in good agreement with neutron scattering experiments.
The electron-phonon coupling ($\lambda$) in $\delta$-NbN ($\lambda=0.98$) is much stronger
than in $\varepsilon$-NbN ($\lambda=0.16$) and WC-NbN ($\lambda=0.11$). This results in a much
higher superconducting transition temperature ($T_c =18.2$ K) than in $\varepsilon$-NbN and
WC-NbN ($T_c \le 1.0$ K). The stronger $\lambda$ and higher $T_c$ in $\delta$-NbN are attributed
to its large density of states at $E_F$ and small Debye temperature. The calculated $T_c$ of $\delta$-NbN
is in good agreement with the experimental values. However, the predicted $T_c$ of $\varepsilon$-NbN
is much smaller than the recent experiment (11.6 K) but agrees well with the earlier experiment.
Finally, the calculated relativistic band structures reveal that all three NbN polytypes are topological
metals. Specifically, $\varepsilon$-NbN and $\delta$-NbN are, respectively, type-I and type-II
Dirac metals, while WC-NbN is an emergent topological metal that has rare triply degenerate nodes.
All these results indicate that all the three NbN polytypes should be hard superconductors with
nontrivial band topology that would provide valuable opportunities for studying fascinating
phenomena arising from the interplay of band topology and superconductivity.
