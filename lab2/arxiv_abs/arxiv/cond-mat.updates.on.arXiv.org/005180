The Kitaev honeycomb model has attracted significant attention due to its exactly solvable spin-liquid
ground state with fractionalized Majorana excitations and its possible materialization in magnetic
Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit couplings. Recently, the 5d-electron compound H$_{3}$LiIr$_{2}$O$_{6}$
has shown to be a strong candidate for Kitaev physics considering the absence of any signs of a long-range
ordered magnetic state. In this work, we demonstrate that a finite density of random vacancies in
the Kitaev model gives rise to a striking pileup of low-energy Majorana eigenmodes and reproduces
the apparent power-law upturn in the specific heat measurements of H$_{3}$LiIr$_{2}$O$_{6}$.
Physically, the vacancies can originate from various sources such as missing magnetic moments
or the presence of non-magnetic impurities (true vacancies), or from local weak couplings of magnetic
moments due to strong but rare bond randomness (quasivacancies). We show numerically that the vacancy
effect is readily detectable even at low vacancy concentrations and that it is not very sensitive
neither to nature of vacancies nor to different flux backgrounds. We also study the response of the
site-diluted Kitaev spin liquid to the three-spin interaction term, which breaks time-reversal
symmetry and imitates an external magnetic field. We propose a field-induced flux-sector transition
where the ground state becomes flux free for larger fields, resulting in a clear suppression of the
low temperature specific heat. Finally, we discuss the effect of dangling Majorana fermions in
the case of true vacancies and show that their coupling to an applied magnetic field via the Zeeman
interaction can also account for the scaling behavior in the high-field limit observed in H$_{3}$LiIr$_{2}$O$_{6}$.
