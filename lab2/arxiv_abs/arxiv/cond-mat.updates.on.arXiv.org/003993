Microscopic imaging based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond, a tool increasingly used
for room-temperature studies of condensed matter systems, has recently been extended to cryogenic
conditions. However, it remains unclear whether the technique is viable for imaging temperature-sensitive
phenomena below 10 K given the inherent laser illumination requirements, especially in a widefield
configuration. Here we realise a widefield NV microscope with a field of view of 100 $\mu$m and a base
temperature of 4 K, and use it to image Abrikosov vortices and transport currents in a superconducting
Nb film. We observe the disappearance of vortices upon increase of laser power and their clustering
about hot spots upon decrease, indicating that laser powers as low as 1 mW (4 orders of magnitude below
the NV saturation) are sufficient to locally quench the superconductivity of the film ($T_c = 9$
K). This significant local heating is confirmed by resistance measurements, which reveal the presence
of large temperature gradients (several K) across the film. We then investigate the effect of such
gradients on transport currents, where the current path is seen to correlate with the temperature
profile even in the fully superconducting phase. In addition to highlighting the role of temperature
inhomogeneities in superconductivity phenomena, this work establishes that, under sufficiently
low laser power conditions, widefield NV microscopy enables imaging over mesoscopic scales down
to 4 K with a submicrometer spatial resolution, providing a new platform for real-space investigations
of a range of systems from topological insulators to van der Waals ferromagnets.
