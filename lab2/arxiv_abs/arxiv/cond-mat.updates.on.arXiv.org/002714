We study the axisymmetric response of a complete spherical shell under homogeneous compressive
pressure $p$ to an additional point force. For a pressure $p$ below the classical critical buckling
pressure $p_c$, indentation by a point force does not lead to spontaneous buckling but an energy
barrier has to be overcome. The states at the maximum of the energy barrier represent a subcritical
branch of unstable stationary points, which are the transition states to a snap-through buckled
state. Starting from nonlinear shallow shell theory we obtain a closed analytical expression for
the energy barrier height, which facilitates its effective numerical evaluation as a function
of pressure by continuation techniques. We find a clear crossover between two regimes: For $p/p_c\ll
1$ the post-buckling barrier state is a mirror-inverted Pogorelov dimple, and for $(1-p/p_c)\ll
1$ the barrier state is a shallow dimple with indentations smaller than shell thickness and exhibits
extended oscillations, which are well described by linear response. We find systematic expansions
of the nonlinear shallow shell equations about the Pogorelov mirror-inverted dimple for $p/p_c\ll
1$ and the linear response state for $(1-p/p_c)\ll 1$, which enable us to derive asymptotic analytical
results for the energy barrier landscape in both regimes. Upon approaching the buckling bifurcation
at $p_c$ from below, we find a softening of an ideal spherical shell. The stiffness for the linear
response to point forces vanishes $\propto (1-p/p_c)^{1/2}$; the buckling energy barrier vanishes
$\propto (1-p/p_c)^{3/2}$. In the Pogorelov limit, the energy barrier maximum diverges $\propto
(p/p_c)^{-3}$ and the corresponding indentation diverges $\propto (p/p_c)^{-2}$. Numerical
prefactors for proportionalities both in the softening and the Pogorelov regime are calculated
analytically.
