The interplay between competing short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) interactions can cause nontrivial
structures in phase diagrams. Recently, horn-shaped unusual structures were found by Monte Carlo
simulations in the phase diagram of the Ising antiferromagnet (IA) with infinite-range ferromagnetic-like
(F) interactions [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 93}, 064109 (2016); {\bf 96}, 174428 (2017)], and also in an IA
with LR interactions of elastic origin modeling spin-crossover materials [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 96},
144425 (2017)]. To clarify the nature of the phases associated with the horn structures, we study
the phase diagram of the IA model with infinite-range F interactions by applying a variational free
energy in a cluster mean-field (CMF) approximation. While the simple Bragg-Williams mean-field
theory for each sublattice does not produce a horn structure, we find such structures with the CMF
method. This confirms that the local thermal fluctuations enabled by the multisite clusters are
essential for this phenomenon. We investigate in detail the structure of metastable phases in the
phase diagram. In contrast to the phase diagram obtained by the Monte Carlo studies, we find a triple
point, at which ferromagnetic-like, antiferromagnetic-like, and disordered phases coexist,
and also six tristable regions accompanying the horn structure. We also point out that several characteristic
endpoints of first-order transitions appear in the phase diagram. We propose three possible scenarios
for the transitions related to the tristable regions. Finally, we discuss the relation between
the triple point in this phase diagram and that of a possible lattice-gas model, in which solid, liquid,
and gas phases can coexist.
