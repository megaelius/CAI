Temperature and angle dependence of resistivity under different magnetic fields have been measured
in Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$NiO$_{2}$ thin films synthesized by the molecular-beam-epitaxy technique
followed by the topotactic soft-chemistry reduction procedure. The onset superconducting transition
occurs at about 16.2 K and zero resistivity appears below 9.3 K at 0 T. Temperature dependent upper
critical fields $H_{c2}^{H\parallel ab}(T)$ and $H_{c2}^{H\parallel c}(T)$ have been determined
by using criterions of $98\%\rho_\mathrm{n}(T)$ and $95\%\rho_\mathrm{n}(T)$ with $\rho_\mathrm{n}(T)$
the normal state resistivity. A temperature dependent anisotropy ratio is thus obtained by $\Gamma(T)=H_{c2}^{H\parallel
ab}(T)/H_{c2}^{H\parallel c}(T)$, which yields a value in the range of 1.2 to 3 near $T_\mathrm{c}$.
In addition, the temperature dependent upper critical fields show a clear negative curvature near
the onset transition temperature, which usually appears in a paramagnetically limited superconductor.
The angle dependence of resistivity at a fixed temperature and different magnetic fields cannot
be scaled to a curve expected by the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory. However at low temperatures,
the resistance difference can be scaled by the parameter $H^\beta |\cos\theta|$ ($\beta=6\sim1$)
with $\theta$ the angle enclosed between the $c$ axis and the applied magnetic field. We interpret
these results as the consequence of a dominated contribution from the paramagnetic limit or the
inhomogeneity of films. Our results clearly indicate small anisotropy and unconventional superconductivity
in Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$NiO$_{2}$.
