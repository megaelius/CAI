The ability to measure the bulk dynamic behavior of soft materials with combined time- and frequency-resolution
is instrumental for improving our fundamental understanding of connections between the microstructural
dynamics and the macroscopic mechanical response. Current state-of-the-art techniques are often
limited by a compromise between resolution in the time and frequency domain, mainly due to the use
of elementary input signals that have not been designed for fast time-evolving systems such as materials
undergoing gelation, curing or self-healing. In this work, we develop an optimized and robust excitation
signal for time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy through the introduction of joint frequency-
and amplitude-modulated exponential chirps. Inspired by the biosonar signals of bats and dolphins,
we optimize the signal profile to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio while minimizing spectral
leakage with a carefully-designed modulation of the envelope of the chirp. A combined experimental
and numerical investigation reveals that there exists an optimal range of window profiles that
minimizes the error with respect to standard single frequency sweep methods. The minimum error
is set by the noise floor of the instrument, suggesting that the accuracy of an optimally windowed
chirp signal is directly comparable to that achievable with a standard frequency sweep, while the
acquisition time can be reduced by up to two orders of magnitude, for comparable spectral content.
Finally, we demonstrate the ability of this optimized signal to provide time- and frequency-resolved
rheometric data by studying the fast gelation process of an acid-induced protein gel. The use of
optimally windowed chirps enables a robust rheological characterization of a wide range of soft
materials undergoing rapid mutation and has the potential to become an invaluable tool for researchers
across different disciplines.
