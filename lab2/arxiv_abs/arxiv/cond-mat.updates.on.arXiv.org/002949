We show that the Wannier obstruction and the fragile topology of the nearly flat bands in twisted
bilayer graphene at magic angle are manifestations of the nontrivial topology of two-dimensional
real wave functions characterized by the Euler class. To prove this, we examine the generic band
topology of two dimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$ symmetry.
The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real two band systems. We show that
a two-band system with a nonzero Euler class cannot have an $I_{ST}$-symmetric Wannier representation.
Moreover, a two-band system with the Euler class $e_{2}$ has band crossing points whose total winding
number is equal to $-2e_2$. Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem fails in systems with
a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the topological phase transition between two insulators
carrying distinct Euler classes can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation
of vortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings. When the number of bands
is bigger than two, there is a $Z_{2}$ topological invariant classifying the band topology, that
is, the second Stiefel Whitney class ($w_2$). Two bands with an even (odd) Euler class turn into a
system with $w_2=0$ ($w_2=1$) when additional trivial bands are added. Although the nontrivial
second Stiefel-Whitney class remains robust against adding trivial bands, it does not impose a
Wannier obstruction when the number of bands is bigger than two. However, when the resulting multi-band
system with the nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney class is supplemented by additional chiral
symmetry, a nontrivial second-order topology and the associated corner charges are guaranteed.
