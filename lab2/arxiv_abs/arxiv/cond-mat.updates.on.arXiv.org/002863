Quantum dots (QDs) can serve as near perfect energy filters and are therefore of significant interest
for the study of thermoelectric energy conversion close to thermodynamic efficiency limits. Indeed,
recent experiments in [Nat. Nano. 13, 920 (2018)] realized a QD heat engine with performance near
these limits and in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. However, these experiments
also highlighted a need for more theory to help guide and understand the practical optimization
of QD heat engines, in particular regarding the role of tunnel couplings on the performance at maximum
power and efficiency for QDs that couple seemingly weakly to electronic reservoirs. Furthermore,
these experiments also highlighted the critical role of the external load when optimizing the performance
of a QD heat engine in practice. To provide further insight into the operation of these engines we
use the Anderson impurity model together with a Master equation approach to perform power and efficiency
calculations up to co-tunneling order. This is combined with additional thermoelectric experiments
on a QD embedded in a nanowire where the power is measured using two methods. We use the measurements
to present an experimental procedure for efficiently finding the external load $R_P$ which should
be connected to the engine to optimize power output. Our theoretical estimates of $R_P$ show a good
agreement with the experimental results, and we show that second order tunneling processes and
non-linear effects have little impact close to maximum power, allowing us to derive a simple analytic
expression for $R_P$. In contrast, we find that the electron contribution to the thermoelectric
efficiency is significantly reduced by second order tunneling processes, even for rather weak
tunnel couplings.
