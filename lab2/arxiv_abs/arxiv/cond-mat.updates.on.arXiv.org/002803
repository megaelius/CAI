The interplay between the structure and dynamics of partially confined Lennard Jones (LJ) fluids,
deep into the supercritical phase, is studied over a wide range of densities in the context of the
Frenkel line (FL), which separates rigid liquidlike and non-rigid gaslike regimes in the phase
diagram of the supercritical fluids. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations carried out at
the two ends of the FL (P = 5000 bars, T = 300 K, and T = 1500 K) reveal intriguing features in supercritical
fluids as a function of stiffness of the partially confining atomistic walls. The liquidlike regime
of a LJ fluid (P = 5000 bars, T = 300 K), mimicking argon, partially confined between walls separated
by 10 {\AA} along the z-axis, and otherwise unconstrained, reveals amorphous and liquidlike structural
signatures in the radial distribution function parallel to the walls and enhanced self-diffusion
as the wall stiffness is decreased. In sharp contrast, in the gas-like regime (P = 5000 bars, T = 1500
K), soft walls lead to increasing structural order hindering self-diffusion. Furthermore, the
correlations between the structure and self-diffusion are found to be well captured by excess entropy.
The rich behavior shown by supercritical fluids under partial confinement, even with simple interatomic
potentials, is found to be fairly independent of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. The study
identifies persisting sub-diffusive features over intermediate time scales, emerging from the
strong interplay between density and confinement, to dictate the evolution and stabilization
of structures. It is anticipated that these results may help gain a better understanding of the behavior
of partially confined complex fluids found in nature.
