Realization of an elemental solid-state quasicrystal has remained a distant dream so far in spite
of extensive work in this direction for almost two decades. Here, we report the discovery of quasiperiodic
ordering in a thick layer of elemental Sn grown on icosahedral ($i$)-Al-Pd-Mn. The STM images and
the LEED patterns of the Sn layer show specific structural signatures that portray quasiperiodicity
but are distinct from the substrate. Photoemission spectroscopy reveals the existence of the pseudogap
around the Fermi energy up to the maximal Sn thickness. The structure of the Sn layer is modeled as
a novel form of quasicrystalline clathrate on the basis of the following: Firstly, from ab-initio
theory, the energy of bulk Sn clathrate quasicrystal is lower than the high temperature metallic
$\beta$-Sn phase, but higher than the low temperature $\alpha$-Sn phase. A comparative study of
the free slab energetics shows that surface energy favors clathrate over $\alpha$-Sn up to about
4 nm layer thickness, and matches $\beta$-Sn for narrow window of slab thickness of 2-3 nm. Secondly,
the bulk clathrate exhibits gap opening near Fermi energy, while the free slab form exhibits a pronouced
pseudogap, which explains the pseudogap observed in photoemission. Thirdly, the STM images exhibit
good agreement with clathrate model. We establish the adlayer-substrate compatibility based
on very similar (within 1%) the cage-cage separation in the Sn clathrate and the pseudo-Mackay cluster-cluster
separation on the $i$-Al-Pd-Mn surface. Furthermore, the nucleation centers of the Sn adlayer
on the substrate are identified and these are shown to be a valid part of the Sn clathrate structure.
Thus, based on both experiment and theory, we propose that 4 nm thick Sn adlayer deposited on 5-fold
surface of $i$-Al-Pd-Mn substrate is in fact a metastable realization of elemental, clathrate
family quasicrystal.
