The Kitaev chain model exhibits topological order which manifests as topological degeneracy,
Majorana edge modes and $Z_{2}$ topological invariant of bulk spectrum. This model can be obtained
from a transverse field Ising model(TFIM) using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. TFIM has neither
topological degeneracy nor any edge modes. These two models are related to each other via duality
transformation which maps local observables in spin model to non-local observables in fermionic
model keeping the $Z2$ symmetry intact. In this paper we asked the question of how topological order
arises in the fermionic models, particularly Majorana fermion models. We find that for the fermionic
models, there are emergent symmetries which protect the topological order in the model. We explore
the full Clifford algebra of Majorana fermions and show that the high order products are also the
symmetries of the Hamiltonian. For the case of odd number of Majorana fermions, there is always a
special operator which behaves like a Majorana fermion and has been called emergent Majorana fermion.
Emergent Majorana fermions are also the Majorana mode operators and these operators are the clear
signature of the topological order in the Hamiltonian. We also show that Majorana fermion Hamiltonians
also have supersymmetry which is tied to the existence of fermionic mode operators and hence to the
topological order. We also explore the implications of these emergent symmetries for the braid
group representations of Majorana fermions. We explore how the quantum entanglement of topologically
ordered phases is related to topological entanglement of their braid group representations. We
notice that braid group representations arise only in the topological phase of the Hamiltonian
and hence can be used to characterize topological phases of the lattice models.
