Microscopic theory of a high temperature cuprate Bi2212 based on main pairing channel of electrons
in CuO planes due to lateral vibrations of the apical oxygen atoms in adjacent the SrO ionic insulator
layer is proposed. Similar ionic substrate phonon model was used recently to explain very high critical
temperature in novel one unit cell FeSe on perovskite STO. A microscopic vibration theory identifies
the 40 meV phonon mode coupled to conducting CuO planes with electron-electron strength 0.5. It
naturally explain the kink in dispersion relation observed by ARPES and the and effect of the isotope
substitution. To describe the pseudogap physics by a single band fourfold symmetric t-t' Hubbard
model, the hopping parameters t'=-0.184 and the on side repulsion energy U=1.9t are chosen. The
electronic system is still strongly correlated, but U is weak enough to be effectively described
by the mean field model and its perturbative extensions. In particular the fragmentation of the
Fermi surface in underdoped samples and the non-circularity of the Fermi Surface are described
well within the "symmetrized Hartree - Fock" approximation. The T star transition line dividing
the pseudogap (locally antiferromagnetic) and paramagnetic phases and susceptibility (describing
spin fluctuations coupling to 2DEG) are also obtained within this approximation. The superconducting
gap was calculated in the framework of the weak coupling approximation for both the phonon and the
spin fluctuations channels. The dominant "glue" responsible for the d - wave pairing is the phonon
mode rather than spin fluctuations, although the later enhances superconductivity by 10-15%.
The dependence of the superconducting gap and certain normal state properties, like the kink in
dispertion relation,on doping, temperature and effect of the oxygen isotope substitution are
obtained.
