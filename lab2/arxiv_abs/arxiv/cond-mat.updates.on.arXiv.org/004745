We use exact diagonalization to study an interacting system of $N$ spinless bosons with finite-range
Gaussian repulsion, confined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap with and without an introduced
rotation. The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix using Davidson algorithm in subspaces
of quantized total angular momentum $L_{z}$ is carried out to obtain the $N$-body lowest eigenenergy
and eigenstate. To bring out the effect of quantum (Bose) statistics and consequent phase stiffness
(rigidity) of the variationally obtained many-body wavefunction on various physical quantities,
our study spans from few-body ($N=2$) to many-body ($N=16$) systems. Further, to examine the finite-range
effect of the repulsive Gaussian potential on many-body ground state properties of the Bose-condensate,
we obtain the lowest eigenstate, the critical angular velocity of single vortex state and the quantum
correlation (measured) in terms of von Neumann entanglement entropy and degree of condensation.
It is found that for small values of the range (measured by the parameter $\sigma$) of Gaussian potential,
the ground state energy increases for few-boson ($2\le N\le 8$) systems but decreases for many-boson
($N>8$) systems. On the other hand for relatively large values of the range of Gaussian potential,
the ground state energy exhibits a monotonic decrease, regardless of the number of bosons $N$. For
a given $N$, there is found an optimal value of the range of Gaussian potential for which the first
vortex (with $L_{z}=N$) nucleates at a lower value of the rotational angular velocity $\Omega_{\bf
c1}$ compared to the zero-range ($\delta$-function) potential. Further, we observe that the inter-particle
interaction and the introduced rotation are competing effects with latter being dominant over
the former.
