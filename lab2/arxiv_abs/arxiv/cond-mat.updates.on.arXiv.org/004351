Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of mesoscopic and atomically resolved
images and spectroscopy in electron and scanning probe microscopy, with the applications ranging
from feature extraction to information compression and elucidation of relevant order parameters
to inversion of imaging data to reconstruct structural models. However, the fundamental limitation
of machine learning methods is their correlative nature, leading to extreme susceptibility to
confounding factors. Here, we implement the workflow for causal analysis of structural scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data and explore the interplay between physical and chemical
effects in ferroelectric perovskite across the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase transitions.
The combinatorial library of the Sm-doped BiFeO3 is grown to cover the composition range from pure
ferroelectric BFO to orthorhombic 20% Sm-doped BFO. Atomically resolved STEM images are acquired
for selected compositions and are used to create a set of local compositional, structural, and polarization
field descriptors. The information-geometric causal inference (IGCI) and additive noise model
(ANM) analysis are used to establish the pairwise causal directions between the descriptors, ordering
the data set in the causal direction. The causal chain for IGCI and ANM across the composition is compared
and suggests the presence of common causal mechanisms across the composition series. Ultimately,
we believe that the causal analysis of the multimodal data will allow exploring the causal links
between multiple competing mechanisms that control the emergence of unique functionalities of
morphotropic materials and ferroelectric relaxors.
