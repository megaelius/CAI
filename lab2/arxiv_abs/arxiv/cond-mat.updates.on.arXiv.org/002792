Fourier's law governing the heat conduction has been considered to be broken in low(one or two)-dimensional
momentum-conserving systems, based on the theory of the semi-macroscopic fluidic continuum.
It is predicted that the heat conductivity in those systems should diverge in the thermodynamic
long-wavelength limit. However, recent molecular-dynamic studies have reported a considerable
number of counterexamples where the intensive property of the heat conductivity and thus Fourier's
law recover in low-dimensional momentum-conserving systems. To answer the conundrum lying between
the semi-macroscopic theory and the microscopic numerics, in this paper, I refine the previous
semi-macroscopic fluid analysis by introducing the elastic response. Based on the fluctuating
elastodynamic equation, the mode-coupling and dynamic renormalization-group analyses show
that the non-zero acoustic wave speeds result in the recovery of Fourier's law by destabilizing
a previously known fixed point keeping the hyper-scaling between the heat conductivity and kinetic
viscosity. The theory based on the dynamic renormalization-group further predicts the size scale
of beginning the recovery of Fourier's law. The prediction is supported by the numerical experiments
of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam(FPU)-$\beta$ lattices, the data of which are collapsed to the predicted scaling
function for the recovery of Fourier's law without any fitting parameters. The provided theory
and numerics suggest the universality of the recovery of Fourier's law in the low-dimensional solids,
which eventually include the one-dimensional fluids sharing the same governing equations with
one-dimensional solids.
