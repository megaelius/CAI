Collective migration dominates many phenomena, from cell movement in living systems to abiotic
self-propelling particles. Focusing on the early stages of tumor evolution, we enunciate the principles
involved in cell dynamics and highlight their implications in understanding similar behavior
in seemingly unrelated soft glassy materials and possibly chemokine-induced migration of CD8$^{+}$
T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal three dimensional model, accounting
for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell interactions as well as cell birth and death to establish
that cell growth rate-dependent tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological
niches. Cells at the periphery move with higher velocity perpendicular to the tumor boundary, while
motion of interior cells is slower and isotropic. The mean square displacement, $\Delta(t)$, of
cells exhibits glassy behavior at times comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting super-diffusive
behavior, $\Delta (t) \approx t^{\alpha}$ ($\alpha > 1$), at longer times. We derive the value of
$\alpha \approx 1.33$ using a field theoretic approach based on stochastic quantization. In the
process we establish the universality of super-diffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated non-equilibrium
systems. Super diffusion at long times arises only if there is an imbalance between cell birth and
death rates. Our findings for the collective migration, which also suggests that tumor evolution
occurs in a polarized manner, are in quantitative agreement with {\it in vitro} experiments. Although
set in the context of tumor invasion the findings should also hold in describing collective motion
in growing cells and in active systems where creation and annihilation of particles play a role.
