The fields of cavity quantum electrodynamics and magnetism have recently merged into \textit{`cavity
spintronics'}, investigating a quasiparticle that emerges from the strong coupling between standing
electromagnetic waves confined in a microwave cavity resonator and the quanta of spin waves, magnons.
This phenomenon is now expected to be employed in a variety of devices for applications ranging from
quantum communication to dark matter detection. To be successful, most of these applications require
a vast control of the coupling strength, resulting in intensive efforts to understanding coupling
by a variety of different approaches. Here, the electromagnetic properties of both resonator and
magnetic samples are investigated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the coupling between
these two systems. Because the coupling is a consequence of the excitation vector fields, which
directly interact with magnetisation dynamics, a highly-accurate electromagnetic perturbation
theory is employed which allows for predicting the resonant hybrid mode frequencies for any field
configuration within the cavity resonator, without any fitting parameters. The coupling is shown
to be strongly dependent not only on the excitation vector fields and sample's magnetic properties
but also on the sample's shape. These findings are illustrated by applying the theoretical framework
to two distinct experiments: a magnetic sphere placed in a three-dimensional resonator, and a rectangular,
magnetic prism placed on a two-dimensional resonator. The theory provides comprehensive understanding
of the overall behaviour of strongly coupled systems and it can be easily modified for a variety of
other systems.
