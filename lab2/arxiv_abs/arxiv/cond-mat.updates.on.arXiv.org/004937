In topological n-type thermoelectrics based on $Bi_{2}Te_{3}$ with atomic substitutions Bi $\rightarrow$
In, Te $\rightarrow$ Se, S, the morphology and the surface states of Dirac fermions on the interlayer
(0001) surface of van der Waals were studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
(STM/STS) techniques. By the STM method, the dark and light spots on the surface were found, which
intensities depend on the composition and thermoelectric properties of solid solutions. The observed
surface morphology features in the solid solutions are explained by distortions of surface electronic
states originated by atomic substitutions, influence of doping impurity, and formation of structural
defects. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the morphology STM images of the (0001) surface were used
to obtain the interference patterns of the quasiparticles excitation caused by surface electrons
scattering by defects. The Dirac point energy and its fluctuations, peak energies of surface defects,
the positions of the valence and conduction band edges, and the energy gap were determined from an
analysis of tunneling spectra. A correlation between the parameters of surface states of Dirac
fermions and thermoelectric properties was found. Thus, a contribution of the fermions surface
states increases with rise of the surface concentration in solid solutions with high power factor,
and the largest concentration value was observed in the $Bi_{1.98}In_{0.02}Te_{2.85}Se_{0.15}$
composition. The dependences of Fermi energy on the wave vector for different solid solutions are
described by a set of Dirac cone sections, which are close within the limits of the fluctuations of
the Dirac point energy that explained by weak changes of the Fermi velocity in the compositions at
studied atomic substitutions in the bismuth telluride sublattices.
