In unconventional superconductors, it is generally believed that understanding the physical
properties of the normal state is a pre-requisite for understanding the superconductivity mechanism.
In conventional superconductors like niobium or lead, the normal state is a Fermi liquid with a well-defined
Fermi surface and well-defined quasipartcles along the Fermi surface. Superconductivity is realized
in this case by the Fermi surface instability in the superconducting state and the formation and
condensation of the electron pairs (Cooper pairing). The high temperature cuprate superconductors,
on the other hand, represent another extreme case that superconductivity can be realized in the
underdoped region where there is neither well-defined Fermi surface due to the pseudogap formation
nor quasiparticles near the antinodal regions in the normal state. Here we report a novel scenario
that superconductivity is realized in a system with well-defined Fermi surface but without quasiparticles
along the Fermi surface in the normal state. High resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission
measurements have been performed on an optimally-doped iron-based superconductor (Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$)Fe$_2$As$_2$.
We find that, while sharp superconducting coherence peaks emerge in the superconducting state
on the hole-like Fermi surface sheets, no quasiparticle peak is present in the normal state. Its
electronic behaviours deviate strongly from a Fermi liquid system. The superconducting gap of
such a system exhibits an unusual temperature dependence that it is nearly a constant in the superconducting
state and abruptly closes at T$_c$. These observations have provided a new platform to study unconventional
superconductivity in a non-Fermi liquid system.
