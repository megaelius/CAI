In the literature on the continuous-variable bosonic teleportation protocol due to [Braunstein
and Kimble, Phys. Rev. Lett., 80(4):869, 1998], it is often loosely stated that this protocol converges
to a perfect teleportation of an input state in the limit of ideal squeezing and ideal detection,
but the exact form of this convergence is typically not clarified. In this paper, I explicitly clarify
that the convergence is in the strong sense, and not the uniform sense, and furthermore, that the
convergence occurs for any input state to the protocol, including the infinite-energy Basel states
defined and discussed here. I also prove, in contrast to the above result, that the teleportation
simulations of pure-loss, thermal, pure-amplifier, amplifier, and additive-noise channels
converge both strongly and uniformly to the original channels, in the limit of ideal squeezing and
detection for the simulations. For these channels, I give explicit uniform bounds on the accuracy
of their teleportation simulations. I then extend these uniform convergence results to particular
multi-mode bosonic Gaussian channels. These convergence statements have important implications
for mathematical proofs that make use of the teleportation simulation of bosonic Gaussian channels,
some of which have to do with bounding their non-asymptotic secret-key-agreement capacities.
As a byproduct of the discussion given here, I confirm the correctness of the proof of such bounds
from my joint work with Berta and Tomamichel from [Wilde, Tomamichel, Berta, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory
63(3):1792, March 2017]. Furthermore, I show that it is not necessary to invoke the energy-constrained
diamond distance in order to confirm the correctness of this proof.
