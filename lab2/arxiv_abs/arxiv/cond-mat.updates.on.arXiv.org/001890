The force-level Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation theory of activated relaxation
in glass-forming free-standing thin films is re-visited to improve its treatment of collective
elasticity effects. The naive cut off of the isotropic bulk displacement field approximation is
improved to explicitly include spatial anisotropy with a modified boundary condition consistent
with a step function liquid-vapor interface. The consequences of this improvement on dynamical
predictions are quantitative but of significant magnitude and in the direction of further speeding
up dynamics and further suppressing Tg. The theory is applied to thin films and also thick films to
address new questions for three different polymers of different dynamic fragility. Variation
of the vitrification time scale criterion over many orders of magnitude is found to have a minor effect
on changes of the film-averaged Tg relative to its bulk value. The mobile layer length scale grows
strongly with cooling and correlates in a nearly linear manner with the effective barrier deduced
from the corresponding bulk isotropic liquid alpha relaxation time. The theory predicts a new type
of spatially inhomogeneous "dynamic decoupling" corresponding to an effective factorization
of the total barrier into its bulk temperature-dependent value multiplied by a function that only
depends on location in the film. The effective decoupling exponent grows as the vapor surface is
approached. Larger reductions of the absolute value of Tg shifts in thin polymer films are predicted
for longer time vitrification criteria and more fragile polymers. Quantitative no-fit-parameter
comparisons with experiment and simulation for film-thickness-dependent Tg shifts of PS and PC
are in reasonable accord with the theory, including a nearly 100 K suppression of Tg in 4 nm PC films.
Predictions are made for polyisobutylene thin films.
