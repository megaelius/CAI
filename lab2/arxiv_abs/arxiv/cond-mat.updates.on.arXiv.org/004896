Chromite is a key magmatic mineral frequently used as petrogenetic indicator of physico-chemical
conditions of mafic magma crystallization. In this work, magnesiochromite and chromite solubility
in a natural basalt and an iron-free haplobasalt was investigated at 1440{\deg}C and atmospheric
pressure under controlled CO-CO2 gas mixtures corresponding to the range two log units below to
two log units above the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer. The source of chromium was either natural
chromite or synthetic Cr2O3, the latter reacting with the basaltic liquids to form a magnesiochromite.
The highest concentrations of Cr in haplobasaltic melts are found in equilibrium with magnesiochromite,
depending on redox conditions. In detail, at low fO2, liquids have high Cr contents, but the variation
of log [Cr, ppm] is not a linear function of log fO2. Using our new data and data from the literature
a model for Cr concentrations at chromite/magnesiochromite saturation in silicate melts has been
developed based upon a thermodynamic formalism. Our model may be used to assess the effect of melt
composition on chromite and magnesiochromite solubility in silicate melts during peridotite
melting and assimilation. At moderate and high oxygen fugacities, concentration levels of Cr at
chromite saturation are higher for ultramafic than for felsic rocks. Our data imply that assimilation
of magnesiochromite-bearing serpentinite lithosphere could result in high Cr contents in mafic
melts, triggering massive crystallization of chromite, especially upon the system hydridization,
cooling, oxidation and magma degassing. Our model may be applied for quantitative prediction of
chromite crystallization and formation of the terrestrial mantle-crust transition zones and
mantle represented by chromitites and dunites.
