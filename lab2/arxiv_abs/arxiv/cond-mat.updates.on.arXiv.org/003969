It is well established that in the low-temperature limit, the two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on a square lattice (2DQHAFSL) exhibits an anomaly in its spectrum at short-wavelengths
on the zone-boundary. In the vicinity of the $(\pi,0)$ point the pole in the one-magnon response
exhibits a downward dispersion, is heavily damped and attenuated, giving way to an isotropic continuum
of excitations extending to high energies. The origin of the anomaly and the presence of the continuum
are of current theoretical interest, with suggestions focused around the idea that the latter evidences
the existence of spinons in a two-dimensional system. Here we present the results of neutron inelastic
scattering experiments and Quantum Monte Carlo calculations on the metallo-organic compound
Cu(DCOO)$_2\cdot 4$D$_2$O (CFTD), an excellent physical realisation of the 2DQHAFSL, designed
to investigate how the anomaly at $(\pi,0)$ evolves up to finite temperatures $T/J\sim2/3$. Our
data reveal that on warming the anomaly survives the loss of long-range, three-dimensional order,
and is thus a robust feature of the two-dimensional system. With further increase of temperature
the zone-boundary response gradually softens and broadens, washing out the $(\pi,0)$ anomaly.
This is confirmed by a comparison of our data with the results of finite-temperature Quantum Monte
Carlo simulations where the two are found to be in good accord. At lower energies, in the vicinity
of the antiferromagnetic zone centre, there was no significant softening of the magnetic excitations
over the range of temperatures investigated.
