We use numerical simulations to study the flow of a bidisperse mixture of athermal, frictionless,
soft-core two dimensional spherocylinders driven by a uniform steady-state simple shear applied
at a fixed volume and a fixed finite strain rate $\dot\gamma$. Energy dissipation is via a viscous
drag with respect to a uniformly sheared host fluid, giving a simple model for flow in a non-Brownian
suspension with Newtonian rheology. Considering a range of packing fractions $\phi$ and particle
asphericities $\alpha$ at small $\dot\gamma$, we study the angular rotation $\dot\theta_i$ and
the nematic orientational ordering $\mathbf{S}_2$ of the particles induced by the shear flow,
finding a non-monotonic behavior as the packing $\phi$ is varied. We interpret this non-monotonic
behavior as a crossover from a small $\phi$ region where single-particle-like behavior occurs,
to a large $\phi$ region where the geometry of the dense packing dominates, the reduced free volume
inhibits motion, and a random Poisson-like process for particle rotations results. We also argue
that the finite nematic ordering $\mathbf{S}_2$ is a consequence of the shearing serving as an ordering
field, rather than a result of long-ranged cooperative behavior among the particles. We arrive
at these conclusions by consideration of (i) the distribution of waiting times for a particle to
rotate by $\pi$, (ii) the behavior of the system under pure, as compared to simple, shearing, (iii)
the relaxation of the nematic order parameter $\mathbf{S}_2$ when perturbed away from the steady
state, and (iv) by construction a numerical mean-field model for the rotational motion of a particle.
Our results also help to explain the singular behavior observed when taking the $\alpha\to 0$ limit
approaching circular disks.
