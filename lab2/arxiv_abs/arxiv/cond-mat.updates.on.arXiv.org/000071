The key to understanding the universal behaviour of systems driven away from equilibrium lies in
the common description obtained when particular microscopic models are reduced to order parameter
equations. Universal order parameter equations written for complex matter fields are widely used
to describe systems as different as Bose-Einstein condensates of ultra cold atomic gases, thermal
convection, nematic liquid crystals, lasers and other nonlinear systems. Exciton-polariton
condensates recently realised in semiconductor microcavities are pattern forming systems that
lie somewhere between equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates and lasers. Because of the imperfect
confinement of the photon component, exciton-polaritons have a finite lifetime, and have to be
continuously re-populated. As photon confinement improves, the system more closely approximates
an equilibrium system. In this chapter we review a number of universal equations which describe
various regimes of the dynamics of exciton-polariton condensates: the Gross-Pitaevskii equation,
which models weakly interacting equilibrium condensates, the complex Ginsburg-Landau equation---the
universal equation that describes the behaviour of systems in the vicinity of a symmetry--breaking
instability, and the complex Swift-Hohenberg equation that in comparison with the complex Ginsburg-Landau
equation contains additional nonlocal terms responsible for spacial mode selection. All these
equations can be derived asymptotically from a generic laser model given by Maxwell-Bloch equations.
Such an universal framework allows the unified treatment of various systems and continuously cross
from one system to another. We discuss the relevance of these equations, and their consequences
for pattern formation.
