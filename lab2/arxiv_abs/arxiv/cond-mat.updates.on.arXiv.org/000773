Motivated by recent experiments, we present here an ab initio study of the impact of the phonon transport
on the thermal conductance and thermoelectric figure of merit of C$_{60}$-based single-molecule
junctions. To be precise, we combine density functional theory with nonequilibrium Green's function
techniques to compute these two quantities in junctions with either a C$_{60}$ monomer or a C$_{60}$
dimer connected to gold electrodes, taking into account the contributions of both electrons and
phonons. Our results show that for C$_{60}$ monomer junctions phonon transport plays a minor role
in the thermal conductance and, in turn, in the figure of merit, which can reach relatively high values
on the order of 0.1, depending on the contact geometry. At the contrary, phonons completely dominate
the thermal conductance in C$_{60}$ dimer junctions and strongly reduce the figure of merit as compared
to monomer junctions. Thus, claims that by stacking C$_{60}$ molecules one could achieve high thermoelectric
performance, which have been made without considering the phonon contribution, are not justified.
Moreover, we analyze the relevance of near-field thermal radiation for the figure of merit of these
junctions within the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics. We conclude that photon tunneling
can be another detrimental factor for the thermoelectric performance, which has been overlooked
so far in the field of molecular electronics. Our study illustrates the crucial roles that phonon
transport and photon tunneling can play when critically assessing the performance of molecular
junctions as potential nanoscale thermoelectric devices.
