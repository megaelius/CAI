Cortical neural circuits display highly irregular spiking in individual neurons but variably
sized collective firing, oscillations and critical avalanches at the population level, all of
which have functional importance for information processing. Theoretically, the balance of excitation
and inhibition inputs is thought to account for spiking irregularity and critical avalanches may
originate from an underlying phase transition. However, the theoretical reconciliation of these
multilevel dynamic aspects remains an open question. Herein, we show that excitation-inhibition
(E-I) balanced network with synaptic kinetics can maintain irregular spiking dynamics with different
levels of synchrony and critical avalanches emerge near the synchronous transition point. The
mechanism is unveiled by a novel mean-field theory that derives the field equations governing the
network macroscopic dynamics. It reveals that the E-I balanced state of the network manifesting
irregular individual spiking is characterized by a macroscopic stable state, which can be either
a fixed point or a periodic motion and the transition is predicted by a Hopf bifurcation in the macroscopic
field. Furthermore, these multiscale variable behaviours can be jointly observed in the spontaneous
activities of mouse cortical slice in vitro, indicating universality of the theoretical prediction.
Our theory unveils the mechanism that permits complex neural activities in different spatiotemporal
scales to coexist and elucidates a possible origin of the criticality of neural systems. It also
provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the macroscopic dynamics of E-I balanced networks
and its relationship to the microscopic counterparts, which can be useful for large-scale modeling
and computation of cortical dynamics.
