The topological Weyl semimetal CaSn3, belonging to the AuCu3 type cubic structure, is an important
electronic system to investigate both from the point of view of fundamental physics and prospective
applications. In this work, we have studied the structural, elastic, mechanical, electronic,
bonding, Fermi surface and optical properties of CaSn3 in detail using the density functional theory.
A comprehensive study of elastic constants and moduli shows that CaSn3 possesses low level of elastic
anisotropy, reasonably good machinability, mixed bonding characteristics with ionic and covalent
contributions, brittle nature and relatively high Vickers hardness with a low Debye temperature.
Analysis of bond population supports the bonding nature as indicated by the elastic parameters.
The bulk electronic band structure reveals clear semimetallic features with signature Dirac cone-like
dispersions near the Fermi level. A pseudogap in the electronic energy density of states at the Fermi
level separating the bonding and the antibonding peaks points towards significant electronic
stability of cubic CaSn3. The Fermi surface mostly consists of electron-like sheets with very few
small hole pockets. The band structure is fairly isotropic in the k-space. The optical constants
show interesting characteristics. The reflectivity spectra show almost non-selective behavior
over a wide range of photon energy encompassing infrared to mid-ultraviolet regions. High reflectivity
over wide spectral range makes CaSn3 a suitable material for reflecting coating. CaSn3 is an efficient
absorber of ultraviolet radiation. The refractive index is very high in the infrared to visible
range. All the energy dependent optical parameters exhibit clear metallic signatures and are in
complete accord with the underlying bulk electronic density of states calculations.
