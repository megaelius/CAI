We discuss the stability of ferromagnetic long-range order in three-dimensional classical XY
ferromagnets upon substitution of a small subset of equally oriented bonds by impurity bonds, on
which the ferromagnetic exchange J_perp > 0 is replaced by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling
J_imp < 0. In the presence of a single impurity bond, once the absolute value of the frustrating coupling
J_imp < 0 exceeds a threshold J_c > 0, the ground state becomes two-fold degenerate, corresponding
to either clockwise or anticlockwise canting of the spins in the vicinity of the impurity bond. In
the presence of a small concentration of impurity bonds, the effective low-energy Hamiltonian
is that of Ising variables encoding the sense of rotation of the local canting around the impurities.
Those degrees of freedom interact through a dipolar interaction mediated by spin waves. A ferromagnetic
Ising ground state indicates the instability of the XY ferromagnet towards a spiral state with a
wave vector proportional to the concentration of impurity bonds. To analyze under which circumstances
such a ground state arises, we study first impurities forming superlattices. For a subclass of those,
we can rigorously establish the existence of spiral order. For another class of superlattices,
the Ising variables order ferromagnetically in planes perpendicular to the orientation of impurity
bonds, but antiferromagnetically parallel to it, which results in a fan-like XY ground state. Second,
we consider the case when the impurity bonds are randomly distributed on the three-dimensional
host lattice according to a Poisson process. We show the phenomenon of spiral order by disorder with
an ordering wave vector proportional to the impurity concentration. The analytical predictions
are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations and are relevant for magnetic materials such as YBaCuFeO_5.
