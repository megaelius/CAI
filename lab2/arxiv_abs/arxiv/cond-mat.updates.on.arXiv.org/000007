We study a two-particle circular billiard containing two finite-size circular particles that
collide elastically with the billiard boundary and with each other. Such a two-particle circular
billiard provides a clean example of an "intermittent" system. This billiard system behaves chaotically,
but the time scale on which chaos manifests can become arbitrarily long as the sizes of the confined
particles become smaller. The finite-time dynamics of this system depends on the relative frequencies
of (chaotic) particle-particle collisions versus (integrable) particle-boundary collisions,
and investigating these dynamics is computationally intensive because of the long time scales
involved. To help improve understanding of such two-particle dynamics, we compare the results
of diagnostics used to measure chaotic dynamics for a two-particle circular billiard with those
computed for two types of one-particle circular billiards in which a confined particle undergoes
random perturbations. Importantly, such one-particle approximations are much less computationally
demanding than the original two-particle system, and we expect them to yield reasonable estimates
of the extent of chaotic behavior in the two-particle system when the sizes of confined particles
are small. Our computations of recurrence-rate coefficients, finite-time Lyapunov exponents,
and autocorrelation coefficients support this hypothesis and suggest that studying randomly
perturbed one-particle billiards has the potential to yield insights into the aggregate properties
of two-particle billiards, which are difficult to investigate directly without enormous computation
times (especially when the sizes of the confined particles are small).
