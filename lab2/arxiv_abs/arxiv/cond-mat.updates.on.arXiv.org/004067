The organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites are composed of organic molecules imbedded in an
inorganic framework. The compounds with general formula CH$_{3}$NH$_{3}$PbX$_{3}$ (MAPbX$_{2}$)
display large photovoltaic efficiencies for halogens $X$=Cl, Br, and I in a wide variety of sample
geometries and preparation methods. The organic cation and inorganic framework are bound by hydrogen
bonds that tether the molecules to the halide anions, and this has been suggested to be important
to the optoelectronic properties. We have studied the effects of this bonding using time-of-flight
neutron spectroscopy to measure the molecular dynamics in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbCl$_3$ (MAPbCl$_3$).
Low-energy/high-resolution neutron backscattering reveals thermally-activated molecular
dynamics with a characteristic temperature of $\sim$ 95\,K. At this same temperature, higher-energy
neutron spectroscopy indicates the presence of an anomalous broadening in energy (reduced lifetime)
associated with the molecular vibrations. By contrast, neutron powder diffraction shows that
a spatially long-range structural phase transitions occurs at 178\,K (cubic $\rightarrow$ tetragonal)
and 173\,K (tetragonal $\rightarrow$ orthorhombic). The large difference between these two temperature
scales suggests that the molecular and inorganic lattice dynamics in MAPbCl$_3$ are actually decoupled.
With the assumption that underlying physical mechanisms do not change with differing halogens
in the organic-inorganic perovskites, we speculate that the energy scale most relevant to the photovoltaic
properties of the lead-halogen perovskites is set by the lead-halide bond, not by the hydrogen bond.
