The coupling between antiferrodistortion (AFD) and ferroelectric (FE) polarization, universal
for all tilted perovskite multiferroics, is known to strongly correlate with domain wall functionalities
in the materials. The intrinsic mechanisms of domain wall phenomena, especially AFD-FE coupling-induced
phenomena at the domain walls, have continued to intrigue the scientific and technological communities
because of the need to develop the future nano-scale electronic devices. Over the past years, theoretical
studies often show controversial results, owing to the fact that they are neither sufficiently
nor directly corroborated with experimental evidences. In this work, the AFD-FE coupling at uncharged
180{\deg} and 71{\deg} domain walls in BiFeO3 films are investigated by means of aberration-corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopy with high resolution (HR-STEM) and rationalized by
phenomenological Landau-Ginsburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. We reveal a peculiar morphology
at the AFD-FE walls, including kinks, meandering, triangle-like regions with opposite oxygen
displacements and curvature near the interface. The LGD theory confirms that the tilt gradient
energy induces these unusual morphology and the features would change delicately with different
kinds of domain walls. Moreover, the 180{\deg} AFD-FE walls are proved to be conductive with an unexpected
reduction of Fe-O-Fe bond angle, which is distinct from theoretical predictions. By exploring
AFD-FE coupling at domain walls and its induced functionalities, we provide exciting evidences
into the links between structural distortions and its electronic properties, which benefit a lot
for fundamental understanding for domain wall functionalities as well as functional manipulations
for novel nano-devices.
