F+ center, an electron trapped at oxygen vacancy (VO), was investigated in the oxygen deficient
Y3Al5O12 (YAG) crystals by EPR. The measurements were performed at temperatures 5-450 K and frequencies
9.4-350 GHz with using both the continue wave and pulse EPR technique. The pulse electron-nuclear
double resonance was applied to resolve the hyperfine interaction of the trapped electron with
surrounding nuclei. The measurements show that at low temperatures, T < 50 K, EPR spectrum of the
F+ center is anisotropic with g factors in the range 1.999-1.988 and originates from three magnetically
inequivalent positions of the center in garnet lattice according to different directions of the
Al(IV)-VO-Al(VI) chains, where Al(IV) and Al(VI) are the tetrahedral and octahedral Al sites,
respectively. As the temperature increases, the EPR spectrum becomes isotropic suggesting a motional
averaging of the anisotropy due to motion of electron between neighboring oxygen vacancies. With
further increase of the temperature to T > 200 K, we observed delocalization of the electron into
the conduction band with the activation energy about 0.4-0.5 eV that resulted in substantial narrowing
of the EPR spectral line with simultaneous change of its shape from the Gaussian to Lorentzian due
to diminish up to zero of the Fermi contact hyperfine field at 27Al and 89Y nuclei. Such temperature
behavior of the F+-center electron in YAG is completely similar to behavior of a donor electron in
a semiconductor. Our findings is further supported by measurements of the conductivity and dielectric
properties. In particular, these data show that the conduction electrons are not homogeneously
distributed in the crystal: there are high-conductive regions separated by poorly-conductive
dielectric layers. This leads to the so-called Maxwell-Wagner dielectric relaxation with huge
apparent dielectric constant at low frequencies.
