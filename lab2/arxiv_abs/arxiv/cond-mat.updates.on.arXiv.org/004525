The three-band \emph{d-p} model is investigated by means of Variational Monte-Carlo method with
the BCS-like wave-function supplemented with the Gutzwiller and Jastrow correlators. Optimization
by means of the Variational Monte-Carlo approach leads to $d$-$wave$ superconducting state with
a characteristic dome-like shape of the order parameter for hole doping $\delta \lesssim 0.4$,
in a good agreement with the experimental observations. Also, the off-diagonal pair-pair correlation
functions, calculated within VMC, vindicate the results obtained very recently within the diagrammatic
expansion of the Gutzwiller wave function method (DE-GWF) [ cf. Phys. Rev. B 99, 104511 (2019)].
Subsequently, the nature of the $d$-$wave$ pairing is investigated by means of recently proposed
\emph{minimal-size real-space $d$-wave pairing operators} [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{100}, 214502
(2019)]. A simultaneous emergence of the long-range superconducting ordering for both $d$ and
$p$ orbitals is reported by analysing the corresponding off-diagonal pair-pair correlation functions.
Additionally, the trial wave-function is used to investigate magnetic properties of the system.
The analysis of the spin-spin correlation functions is carried out and results with an evidence
of antiferromagnetic $\mathbf{q}=(\pi,\pi)$, short-range order, as expected. For the sake of
completeness, estimation of the charge gap results in $\Delta_{CG}\approx1.78\pm0.51\text{
eV}$, which agrees with values reported experimentally for the cuprates. The presented results
provide a decisive confirmation of the former results obtained variationally in the spatially
homogeneous case in infinite systems.
