In the present investigation, some novel magnetic behaviors exhibited by double perovskite (DP)
Eu2CoMnO6(ECMO) has been reported. XRD analysis of ECMO showed that it has a monoclinic crystal
structure (space group P 21/n). A second-order magnetic phase transition as a sudden jump in the
magnetization curve has been observed at 124.5 K. This is related to the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic/E*-type
antiferromagnetic phase transition due to the competing Co-O-Mn exchange interactions. A clear
low-temperature compensation point followed by negative magnetization is observed in the zero-field-cooled
curve of the sample, suggesting the formation of canted ferromagnetic domains or antiparallel
spins and clusters that are separated by an antiphase boundary. The large bifurcation between the
ZFC and FC curves has been observed, suggesting strong spin frustration is present in the system.
More interestingly, sharp multiple steps in magnetization are observed in M-H curve at 2 K and observed
only in the forward field-sweep direction which vanishes on increasing temperature. Moreover,
prominent smaller peaks immediately above the long-range ordering temperature are observed suggesting
the presence of preformed percolating clusters which eventually gives rise to Griffiths like phase
which is seen in DC as well in AC susceptibility. The real part of AC susceptibility with DC bias shows
an unusual sharp peak near TC that broadens on increasing field strength and splits into two maxima
around 750 Oe, which is attributed to the presence of critical fluctuations associated with a continuous
transition to the FM state and large magnetic anisotropy in the system.
