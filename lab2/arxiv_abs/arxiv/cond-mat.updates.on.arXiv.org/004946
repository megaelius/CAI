Statistical properties of the electron transport flowing through nanostructures are strongly
influenced by the interactions, geometry of the system and/or by type of the external electrodes.
These factors affect not only the average current induced in the system but also contribute to fluctuations
in the flux of charges and their correlations. Due to possible applications of the hybrid nano-systems,
containing one or more superconducting electrodes, a detailed understanding of the flow of charge
and its fluctuations seems to be of primary importance. Coulomb repulsion between electrons usually
strongly affect the current-current correlation function. In this work we study the correlations
in the charge flow through such interacting quantum dot contacted to one superconducting and two
normal electrodes. This set-up allows for analysis of the Andreev scattering events in the correlations
of currents flowing between external electrodes and, in particular, gives access to cross-correlations
between currents from/to different normal electrodes. Our approach relies on the master equation
technique, which properly captures the Coulomb interactions. We study the finite frequency correlations
and find the relaxation processes, related to the high frequency charge and low frequency polarisation
fluctuations. The multiterminal structure of here studied single electron device allows to analyze
a competition between the intra- and inter-channel correlations. In the appropriate limit of the
interacting quantum dot embedded between two normal electrodes our calculations quantitatively
describe the recent experimental data on the frequency dependent correlations. This shows a promising
potential of the method for description of the hybrid systems with superconducting electrode(s).
