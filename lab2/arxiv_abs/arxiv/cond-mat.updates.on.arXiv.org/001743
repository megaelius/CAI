Semiconducting 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are emerging in
nanomechanics, optoelectronics, and thermal transport. In each of these fields, perfect control
over 2D material properties including strain, doping, and heating is necessary, especially on
the nanoscale. Here, we study clean devices consisting of membranes of single-layer MoS2 suspended
on pillar arrays. Using Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we have been able to extract,
separate and simulate the different contributions on the nanoscale and to correlate these to the
pillar array design. This control has been used to design a periodic MoS2 mechanical membrane with
a high reproducibility and to perform optomechanical measurements on arrays of similar resonators
with a high-quality factor of 600 at ambient temperature, hence opening the way to multi-resonator
applications with 2D materials. At the same time, this study constitutes a reference for the future
development of well-controlled optical emissions within 2D materials on periodic arrays with
reproducible behavior. We measured a strong reduction of the MoS2 band-gap induced by the strain
generated from the pillars. A transition from direct to indirect band gap was observed in isolated
tent structures made of MoS2 and pinched by a pillar. In fully suspended devices, simulations were
performed allowing both the extraction of the thermal conductance and doping of the layer. Using
the correlation between the influences of strain and doping on the MoS2 Raman spectrum, we have developed
a simple, elegant method to extract the local strain in suspended and non-suspended parts of a membrane.
This opens the way to experimenting with tunable coupling between light emission and vibration.
