We investigated the electronic and optical properties of bilayer AB stacked Boron and Nitrogen
vacancies in hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) using density functional theory (DFT). The density
of states (DOS) and electronic band structure showed that Boron vacancy in bilayer h-BN results
in a magnetic and conducting ground state. The band gap energy ranges from 4.56 eV for the pristine
BN bilayer to 0.12 eV for a single Nitrogen vacancy in the bilayer. Considering the presence of 1,3,4-Boron
vacancy, half metallic character is observed. However, the 2-boron vacancy configuration resulted
in metallic character. The bilayers with 1,2,3,4- Nitrogen vacancy has a band gap of 0.39, 0.33,
0.28 and 0.12eV respectively, which is significantly less than the pristine band gap. Also B and
N vacancy induces ferromagnetism in the h-BN bilayer. The maximum total magnetic moment for the
Boron vacant system is 6.583uB in case of 4-Boron vacancy configuration. In case of Nitrogen vacancy
system it is 3.926uB for 4-Nitrogen vacancy configuration. The optical response of the system is
presented in terms of the absorption coefficient, refractive index and dielectric constant for
pristine as well as the defective configurations. Negative value of dielectric constant for Boron
vacant system in the energy range 0.9-1.4 eV and for Nitrogen vacant system in the energy range 0.5-0.8
eV opens an opportunity for it to be utilized for negative index optical materials. The current study
shows that B and N vacancies in bilayer h-BN could have potential applications in nano-structure
based electronics, optoelectronics and spintronic devices.
