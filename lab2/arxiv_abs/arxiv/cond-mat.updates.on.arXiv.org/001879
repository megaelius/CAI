Tiny-sized particles under the scheme of monolayer assembly of gold atoms developed at different
processing time. For different processing time, atoms of tiny-shaped particles bind under the
packets of nano shape energy resulting into elongate from centers along opposite poles converting
one-dimensional arrays into structure of smooth elements. Tiny-shaped particles pack to develop
extended shapes at different processing time where development rate is not more than millisecond
time. Increasing the processing time of solution upto certain duration increases the number of
developing triangular-shaped tiny particles. Adjacent orientation of electrons in atoms of tiny-shaped
particle is because of orientational based stretching of their clamped energy knots where adjust
potential energy as per exertion of force. Tiny-shaped particles develop near the axis of zero-force
belonging to surface format, their atoms elongate less from the centers because of the intervening
lateral exertion of force. So, particles shape-like rod and bar are developed. Tiny-shaped particles
where their atoms elongate more, they develop mainly particles shape-like hexagon and triangle
where less width of each structure of smooth element and their inter-spacing distance was measured
when compared to the particles of rod and bar. Different widths of smooth elements along with their
inter-spacing distance for one-dimensional particles and different-dimensional particles
are measured in their selective area patterns giving the same results as in their high-resolution
images. When certain electrons of parallelly developed structure of smooth elements under appropriate
coinciding exerted for lateral force, they bind in a single smooth element by giving double width.
This study also pinpoints disregard of the theory of van der Waals interactions and surface plasmons
phenomenon opening multiple routes to design materials.
