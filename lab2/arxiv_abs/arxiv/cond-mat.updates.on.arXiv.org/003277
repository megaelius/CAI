Heat conduction in dielectric crystals originates from the propagation of atomic vibrational
waves, whose microscopic dynamics is well described by linearized or generalized phonon Boltzmann
transport. Recently, it was shown that the thermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a
closed form as a sum over relaxons, $\mathit{i.e.}$ the collective phonon excitations that are
eigenvectors of Boltzmann equation's scattering matrix [Cepellotti and Marzari, Phys. Rev. X
$\mathbf{6}$, 041013 (2016)]. Relaxons have a well-defined parity and only odd relaxons contribute
to the thermal conductivity. Here, we show that the complementary set of even relaxons determines
another quantity --- the thermal viscosity --- that enters into the description of heat transport
in the hydrodynamic regime, where dissipation of crystal momentum by Umklapp scattering phases
out. We also show how the thermal viscosity and conductivity parametrize two novel viscous heat
equations --- two coupled equations for the local temperature and drift velocity fields --- which
represent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics in the linear,
laminar regime. These viscous heat equations are derived from a coarse-graining of the linearized
Boltzmann transport equation for phonons, and encompass both limits of Fourier's law or second
sound for strong or weak Umklapp dissipation, respectively. Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation
number, a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the steady-state deviations from Fourier's
law due to hydrodynamic effects. We showcase these findings in a test case of a complex-shaped device
made of silicon or diamond. This formulation generalizes rigorously Fourier's heat equation,
and extends the reach of microscopic computational techniques to characterize the fundamental
parameters governing heat conduction.
