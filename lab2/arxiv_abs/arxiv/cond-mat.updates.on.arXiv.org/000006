We study the structure, stability, and dynamics of dark solitary waves in parabolically trapped,
collisionally inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spatially periodic variations
of the scattering length. This collisional inhomogeneity yields a nonlinear lattice, which we
tune from a small-amplitude, approximately sinusoidal structure to a periodic sequence of densely
spaced spikes. We start by investigating time-independent inhomogeneities, and we subsequently
examine the dynamical response when one starts with a collisionally homogeneous BEC and then switches
on an inhomogeneity either adiabatically or nonadiabatically. Using Bogoliubov-de Gennes linearization
as well as direct numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we observe dark solitary
waves, which can become unstable through oscillatory or exponential instabilities. We find a critical
wavelength of the nonlinear lattice that is comparable to the healing length. Near this value, the
fundamental eigenmode responsible for the stability of the dark solitary wave changes its direction
of movement as a function of the strength of the nonlinearity. When it increases, it collides with
other eigenmodes, leading to oscillatory instabilities; when it decreases, it collides with the
origin and becomes imaginary, illustrating that the instability mechanism is fundamentally different
in wide-well versus narrow-well lattices. When starting from a collisionally homogeneous setup
and switching on inhomogeneities, we find that dark solitary waves are preserved generically for
aligned lattices. We briefly examine the time scales for the onset of solitary-wave oscillations
in this scenario.
