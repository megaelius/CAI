Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) has been a key enabling technology in exploring
quantum phenomena and their applications for decades. For instance, traditional SPDC, which splits
a high energy pump photon into two lower energy photons, is a common way to produce entangled photon
pairs. Since the early realizations of SPDC, researchers have thought to generalize it to higher
order, e.g., to produce entangled photon triplets. However, directly generating photon triplets
through a single SPDC process has remained elusive. Here, using a flux-pumped superconducting
parametric cavity, we demonstrate direct three-photon SPDC, with photon triplets generated in
a single cavity mode or split between multiple modes. With strong pumping, the states can be quite
bright, with flux densities exceeding 60 photon/s/Hz. The observed states are strongly non-Gaussian,
which has important implications for potential applications. In the single-mode case, we observe
a triangular star-shaped distribution of quadrature voltages, indicative of the long-predicted
"star state". The observed star state shows strong third-order correlations, as expected for a
state generated by a cubic Hamiltonian. By pumping at the sum frequency of multiple modes, we observe
strong three-body correlations between multiple modes, strikingly, in the absence of second-order
correlations. We further analyze the third-order correlations under mode transformations by
the symplectic symmetry group, showing that the observed transformation properties serve to "fingerprint"
the specific cubic Hamiltonian that generates them. The observed non-Gaussian, third-order correlations
represent an important step forward in quantum optics and may have a strong impact on quantum communication
with microwave fields as well as continuous-variable quantum computation.
