Recent developments in the relationship between bulk topology and surface crystal symmetry have
led to the discovery of materials whose gapless surface states are protected by crystal symmetries.
In fact, there exists only a very limited set of possible surface crystal symmetries, captured by
the 17 "wallpaper groups." We show that a consideration of symmetry-allowed band degeneracies
in the wallpaper groups can be used to understand previous topological crystalline insulators,
as well as to predict new examples. In particular, the two wallpaper groups with multiple glide lines,
$pgg$ and $p4g$, allow for a new topological insulating phase, whose surface spectrum consists
of only a single, fourfold-degenerate, true Dirac fermion. Like the surface state of a conventional
topological insulator, the surface Dirac fermion in this "nonsymmorphic Dirac insulator" provides
a theoretical exception to a fermion doubling theorem. Unlike the surface state of a conventional
topological insulator, it can be gapped into topologically distinct surface regions while keeping
time-reversal symmetry, allowing for networks of topological surface quantum spin Hall domain
walls. We report the theoretical discovery of new topological crystalline phases in the A$_2$B$_3$
family of materials in SG 127, finding that Sr$_2$Pb$_3$ hosts this new topological surface Dirac
fermion. Furthermore, (100)-strained Au$_2$Y$_3$ and Hg$_2$Sr$_3$ host related topological
surface hourglass fermions. We also report the presence of this new topological hourglass phase
in Ba$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ in SG 55. For orthorhombic space groups with two glides, we catalog all possible
bulk topological phases by a consideration of the allowed non-abelian Wilson loop connectivities,
and we develop topological invariants for these systems. Finally, we show how in a particular limit,
these crystalline phases reduce to copies of the SSH model.
