In a companion paper, we proposed new analytical expressions of cluster sink-strengths (CSS) indispensable
to any complete parameterization of rate equations cluster dynamics accounting for reaction between
defect clusters populations having a 1D-mobility. In this second paper, we first establish simulation
setup rules for truly converged estimates of effective CSS by Kinetic Monte-Carlo, and then we grid
on a wide set of radii, rotation energies, diffusion coefficients and concentrations of both reaction
partners. Symmetric roles of some parameters are used to infer a generic form for a semi-analytical
expression of CSS depending on all these interaction parameters: it is composed of the various analytical
limiting cases established and fitted transition functions that allow a gradual switching between
them. The analysis of the residuals shows that the overall agreement is reasonably good: it is only
in the transition zones that discrepancies are located and this is due to the asymmetry of the actual
transition functions. The expression can be easily extended to temperatures at least a few hundred
degrees around the reference. But further extending the CSS evaluations to much smaller diffusion
coefficients ratios, we see that the domain for 1D-1D mobility is very extended: for a $10^{-3}$
ratio the computed CSS is still not correctly described by the 1D-CSS with respect to a fixed sink
(1D-0), but rather by the established 1D-1D expression. For our typical sets of conditions, it is
only when approaching a ratio of $10^{-6}$ that the 1D-0 CSS starts to become more relevant. This
highlights the counter-intuitive fact that the growth kinetics of moderately trapped 1D mobile
loops, whose effective mobility is greatly reduced, may not be described by 1D-0 kinetics but rather
by appropriately corrected 1D-1D CSS which have completely different order of magnitude and kinetic
orders.
