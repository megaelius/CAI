We present a fully ab initio approach based on many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation,
to compute the quasiparticle levels of large interface systems without significant covalent interactions
between the different components of the interface. The only assumption in our approach is that the
polarizability matrix (chi) of the interface can be given by the sum of the polarizability matrices
of individual components of the interface. We show analytically, using a two-state hybridized
model, that this assumption is valid even in the presence of interface hybridization to form bonding
and anti-bonding states, up to first order in the overlap matrix elements involved in the hybridization.
We validate our approach by showing that the band structure obtained in our method is almost identical
to that obtained using a regular GW calculation for bilayer black phosphorus, where interlayer
hybridization is significant. Significant savings in computational time and memory are obtained
by computing chi only for the smallest sub-unit cell of each component, and expanding (unfolding)
the chi matrix to that in the unit cell of the interface. To treat interface hybridization, the full
wavefunctions of the interface are used in computing the self-energy. We thus call the method XAF-GW
(X: eXpand-chi, A: Add-chi, F: Full wavefunctions). Compared to GW-embedding type approaches
in the literature, the XAF-GW approach is not limited to specific screening environments or to non-hybridized
interface systems. XAF-GW can also be applied to systems with different dimensionalities, as well
as to Moire superlattices such as in twisted bilayers. We illustrate the generality and usefulness
of our approach by applying it to self-assembled PTCDA monolayers on Au(111) and Ag(111), and PTCDA
monolayers on graphite-supported monolayer WSe2, where good agreement with experiment is obtained.
