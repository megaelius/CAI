Nanostructures with open shell transition metal or molecular constituents host often strong electronic
correlations and are highly sensitive to atomistic material details. This tutorial review discusses
method developments and applications of theoretical approaches for the realistic description
of the electronic and magnetic properties of nanostructures with correlated electrons. First,
the implementation of a flexible interface between density functional theory and a variant of dynamical
mean field theory (DMFT) highly suitable for the simulation of complex correlated structures is
explained and illustrated. On the DMFT side, this interface is largely based on recent developments
of quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization techniques allowing for efficient descriptions
of general four fermion Coulomb interactions, reduced symmetries and spin-orbit coupling, which
are explained here. With the examples of the Cr (001) surfaces, magnetic adatoms, and molecular
systems it is shown how the interplay of Hubbard U and Hund's J determines charge and spin fluctuations
and how these interactions drive different sorts of correlation effects in nanosystems. Non-local
interactions and correlations present a particular challenge for the theory of low dimensional
systems. We present our method developments addressing these two challenges, i.e., advancements
of the dynamical vertex approximation and a combination of the constrained random phase approximation
with continuum medium theories. We demonstrate how non-local interaction and correlation phenomena
are controlled not only by dimensionality but also by coupling to the environment which is typically
important for determining the physics of nanosystems.
