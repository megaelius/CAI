Levy flights are random walks in which the probability distribution of the step sizes is fat-tailed.
Levy spatial diffusion has been observed for a collection of ultra-cold Rb atoms and single Mg+ ions
in an optical lattice. Using the semiclassical theory of Sisyphus cooling, we treat the problem
as a coupled Levy walk, with correlations between the length and duration of the excursions. The
problem is related to the area under Bessel excursions, overdamped Langevin motions that start
and end at the origin, constrained to remain positive, in the presence of an external logarithmic
potential. In the limit of a weak potential, the Airy distribution describing the areal distribution
of the Brownian excursion is found. Three distinct phases of the dynamics are studied: normal diffusion,
Levy diffusion and, below a certain critical depth of the optical potential, x~ t^{3/2} scaling.
The focus of the paper is the analytical calculation of the joint probability density function from
a newly developed theory of the area under the Bessel excursion. The latter describes the spatiotemporal
correlations in the problem and is the microscopic input needed to characterize the spatial diffusion
of the atomic cloud. A modified Montroll-Weiss (MW) equation for the density is obtained, which
depends on the statistics of velocity excursions and meanders. The meander, a random walk in velocity
space which starts at the origin and does not cross it, describes the last jump event in the sequence.
In the anomalous phases, the statistics of meanders and excursions are essential for the calculation
of the mean square displacement, showing that our correction to the MW equation is crucial, and points
to the sensitivity of the transport on a single jump event. Our work provides relations between the
statistics of velocity excursions and meanders and that of the diffusivity.
