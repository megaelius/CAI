Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons is one of few macroscopic quantum phenomena observable
at room temperature. Due to competition of the exchange and the magnetic dipole interactions the
minimum-energy magnon state is doubly degenerate and corresponds to two antiparallel non-zero
wavevectors. Correspondingly, magnon BEC differs essentially from other condensates, since
it takes place simultaneously at +/-k_min. The degeneracy of BEC and interaction between its two
components have significant impact on the condensate properties. Phase locking of the two condensates
causes formation of a standing wave of the condensate density and quantized vortices. Additionally,
interaction between the two components is believed to be important for stabilization of the condensate
with respect to the real-space collapse. Thus, the possibility to create a non-degenerate, single-component
condensate is decisive for understanding of underlying physics of magnon BEC. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate an approach, which allows one to accomplish this challenging task. We show that this
can be achieved by using a separation of the two components of the degenerate condensate in the real
space by applying a local pulsed magnetic field, which causes their motion in the opposite directions.
Thus, after a certain delay, the two clouds corresponding to different components become well separated
in the real space. We find that the motion of the clouds can be described well based on the peculiarities
of the magnon dispersion characteristics. Additionally, we show that, during the motion, the condensate
cloud harvests non-condensed magnons, which results in a partial compensation of the condensate
depletion.
