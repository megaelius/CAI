Motivated by RIXS experiments on a wide range of complex heavy oxides, including rhenates, osmates,
and iridates, we discuss the theory of RIXS for site-localized $t_{2g}$ orbital systems with strong
spin-orbit coupling. For such systems, we present exact diagonalization results for the spectrum
at different electron fillings, showing that it accesses "single-particle" and "multi-particle"
excitations. This leads to a simple picture for the energies and intensities of the RIXS spectra
in Mott insulators such as double perovskites which feature highly localized electrons, and yields
estimates of the spin-orbit coupling and Hund's coupling in correlated $5d$ oxides. We present
new higher resolution RIXS data at the Re-L$_3$ edge in Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ which finds a previously
unresolved peak splitting, providing further confirmation of our theoretical predictions. Using
ab initio electronic structure calculations on Ba$_2$${\cal M}$ReO$_6$ (with ${\cal M}$=Re,
Os, Ir) we show that while the atomic limit yields a reasonable effective Hamiltonian description
of the experimental observations, effects such as $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ interactions and hybridization
with oxygen are important. Our ab initio estimate for the strength of the intersite exchange coupling
shows that, compared to the osmates, the exchange is one or two orders of magnitude weaker in the rhenates
and iridates, which may partly explain the suppression of long-range magnetic order in the latter
compounds. As a way to interpolate between the site-localized picture and our electronic structure
band calculations, we discuss the spin-orbital levels of the ${\cal M}$O$_6$ cluster. This suggests
a possible role for non-dispersive intra-cluster excitons in Ba$_2$YIrO$_6$ which may lead to
a weak breakdown of the atomic $J_{\rm eff}=0$ picture and to small magnetic moments.
