This work describes through semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and simulation a novel nanostructured
material design that can lead to unprecedentedly high thermoelectric power factors, with improvements
of more than an order of magnitude compared to optimal bulk material power factors. The design is
based on a specific grain/grain-boundary (potential well/barrier) engineering such that: i)
carrier energy filtering is achieved using potential barriers, combined with ii) higher than usual
doping operating conditions such that high carrier velocities and mean-free-paths are utilized,
iii) minimal carrier energy relaxation after passing over the barriers to propagate the high Seebeck
coefficient of the barriers into the potential wells, and importantly, iv) the formation of an intermediate
dopant-free (depleted) region. The design consists thus of a three-region geometry, in which the
high doping resides in the center/core of the potential well, with a dopant-depleted region separating
the doped region from the potential barriers. It is shown that the filtering barriers are optimal
when they mitigate the reduction in conductivity they introduce, and this can be done primarily
when they are clean from dopants during the process of filtering. The potential wells, on the other
hand, are optimal when they mitigate the reduced Seebeck they introduce by: i) not allowing carrier
energy relaxation, and importantly ii) by mitigating the reduction in mobility that the high concentration
of dopant impurities cause. Dopant segregation, with clean dopant-depletion regions around the
potential barriers, serves this key purpose of improved mobility towards the phonon-limited mobility
levels in the wells. Using quantum transport simulations as well as semi-classical Monte Carlo
simulations we also verify the important ingredients and validate this clean-filtering design.
