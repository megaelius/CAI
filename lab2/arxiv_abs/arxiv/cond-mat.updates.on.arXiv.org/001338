We use the optimal fluctuation method to evaluate the short-time probability distribution $\mathcal{P}\left(H,L,t\right)$
of height at a single point, $H=h\left(x=0,t\right)$, of the evolving Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
interface $h\left(x,t\right)$ on a ring of length $2L$. The process starts from a flat interface.
At short times typical (small) height fluctuations are unaffected by the KPZ nonlinearity and belong
to the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class. The nonlinearity, however, strongly affects the
(asymmetric) tails of $\mathcal{P}(H)$. At large $L/\sqrt{t}$ the faster-decaying tail has a
double structure: it is $L$-independent, $-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim\left|H\right|^{5/2}/t^{1/2}$,
at intermediately large $|H|$, and $L$-dependent, $-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim \left|H\right|^{2}L/t$,
at very large $|H|$. The transition between these two regimes is sharp and, in the large $L/\sqrt{t}$
limit, behaves as a fractional-order phase transition. The transition point $H=H_{c}^{+}$ depends
on $L/\sqrt{t}$. At small $L/\sqrt{t}$, the double structure of the faster tail disappears, and
only the very large-$H$ tail, $-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim \left|H\right|^{2}L/t$, is observed. The
slower-decaying tail does not show any $L$-dependence at large $L/\sqrt{t}$, where it coincides
with the slower tail of the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution. At small $L/\sqrt{t}$ this tail also has
a double structure. The transition between the two regimes occurs at a value of height $H=H_{c}^{-}$
which depends on $L/\sqrt{t}$. At $L/\sqrt{t} \to 0$ the transition behaves as a mean-field-like
second-order phase transition. At $|H|<|H_c^{-}|$ the slower tail behaves as $-\ln\mathcal{P}\sim
\left|H\right|^{2}L/t$, whereas at $|H|>|H_c^{-}|$ it coincides with the slower tail of the GOE
Tracy-Widom distribution.
