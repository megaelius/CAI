We investigate proximity-induced mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconducting state
on the surface states of a topological insulator. Such hybrid structure features fundamentally
distinct electron-hole excitations and resulting effective superconducting subgap. Studying
the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetry properties of the mixed state Dirac-Bogoliubov-de
Gennes effective Hamiltonian gives rise to manifesting possible topological phase exchange of
surface states, since the mixed-spin channels leads to appearance of a band gap on the surface states.
This is verified by determining topological invariant winding number for chiral eigenstates,
which is achieved by introducing a chiral symmetry operator. We interestingly find the role of mixed
superconducting state as creating a mass-like gap in topological insulator by means of introducing
new mixed-spin channels $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$. The interplay between superconducting spin-singlet
and triplet correlations actually results in gaped surface states, where the size of gap can be controlled
by tuning the relative $s$ and $p$-waves pairing potentials. We show that the system is in different
topology classes by means of chiral and no-chiral spin-triplet symmetry. In addition, the resulting
effective superconductor subgap manipulated at the Fermi surface presents a complicated dependency
on mixed-spin channels. Furthermore, we investigate the resulting subgap tunneling conductance
in N/S and Josephson current in S/I/S junctions to unveil the influence of effective symmetry of
mixed superconducting gap. The results can pave the way to realize the effective superconducting
gap in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with mixed-spin state.
