We study the homotopy classification of symmetry representations to describe the bulk topological
invariants protected by the combined operation of a two-fold rotation $C_{2z}$ and time-reversal
$T$ symmetries. We define topological invariants as obstructions to having smooth Bloch wave functions
compatible with a momentum-independent symmetry representation. When the Bloch wave functions
are required to be smooth, the information on the band topology is contained in the symmetry representation.
This implies that the $d$-dimensional homotopy class of the unitary matrix representation of the
symmetry operator corresponds to the $d$-dimensional topological invariants. Here, we prove
that the second Stiefel-Whitney number, a two-dimensional topological invariant protected by
$C_{2z}T$, is the homotopy invariant that characterizes the second homotopy class of the matrix
representation of $C_{2z}T$. As an application of our result, we show that the three-dimensional
bulk topological invariant for the $C_{2z}T$-protected topological crystalline insulator proposed
by C. Fang and L. Fu in Phys. Rev. B 91, 161105(R) (2015), which we call the 3D strong Stiefel Whitney
insulator, is identical to the quantized magnetoelectric polarizability. The bulk-boundary
correspondence associated with the quantized magnetoelectric polarizability shows that the
3D strong Stiefel-Whitney insulator has chiral hinges states as well as 2D massless surface Dirac
fermions. This shows that the 3D strong Stiefel Whitney insulator has the characteristics of both
the first order and the second order topological insulators, simultaneously, which is consistent
with the recent classification of higher-order topological insulators protected by an order-two
symmetry.
