A mesoscale study of a single crystal nickel-base superalloy subjected to an industrially relevant
process simulation has revealed the complex interplay between microstructural development and
the micromechanical behaviour. As sample gauge volumes were smaller than the length scale of the
highly cored structure of the parent material from which they were produced, their subtle composition
differences gave rise to differing work hardening rates, influenced by varying secondary dendrite
arm spacings, gamma-prime phase solvus temperatures and a topologically inverted gamma/gamma-prime
microstructure. The gamma-prime precipitates possessed a characteristic `X' morphology, resulting
from the simultaneously active solute transport mechanisms of thermally favoured octodendritic
growth and N-type rafting, indicating creep-type mechanisms were prevalent. High resolution-electron
backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) characterisation reveals deformation patterning that follows
the gamma/gamma-prime microstructure, with high geometrically necessary dislocation density
fields localised to the gamma/gamma-prime interfaces; Orowan looping is evidently the mechanism
that mediated plasticity. Examination of the residual elastic stresses indicated the `X' gamma-prime
precipitate morphology had significantly enhanced the deformation heterogeneity, resulting
in stress states within the gamma channels that favour slip, and that encourage further growth of
gamma-prime precipitate protrusions. The combination of such localised plasticity and residual
stresses are considered to be critical in the formation of the recrystallisation defect in subsequent
post-casting homogenisation heat treatments.
