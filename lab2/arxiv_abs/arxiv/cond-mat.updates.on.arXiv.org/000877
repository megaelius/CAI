We present Fermi's golden rule calculations of the optical carrier injection and the coherent control
of current injection in graphene nanoribbons with zigzag geometry, using an envelope function
approach. This system possesses strongly localized states (flat bands) with a large joint density
of states at low photon energies; for ribbons with widths above a few tens of nanometers, this system
also posses large number of (non-flat) states with maxima and minima close to the Fermi level. Consequently,
even with small dopings the occupation of these localized states can be significantly altered.
In this work, we calculate the relevant quantities for coherent control at different chemical potentials,
showing the sensitivity of this system to the occupation of the edge states. We consider coherent
control scenarios arising from the interference of one-photon absorption at $2\hbar\omega$ with
two-photon absorption at $\hbar\omega$, and those arising from the interference of one-photon
absorption at $\hbar\omega$ with stimulated electronic Raman scattering (virtual absorption
at $2\hbar\omega$ followed by emission at $\hbar\omega$). Although at large photon energies these
processes follow an energy-dependence similar to that of 2D graphene, the zigzag nanoribbons exhibit
a richer structure at low photon energies, arising from divergences of the joint density of states
and from resonant absorption processes, which can be strongly modified by doping. As a figure of
merit for the injected carrier currents, we calculate the resulting swarm velocities. Finally,
we provide estimates for the limits of validity of our model.
