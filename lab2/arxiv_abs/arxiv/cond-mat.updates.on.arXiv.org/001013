The spontaneous nucleation of accelerating slip along slowly driven frictional interfaces is
central to a broad range of geophysical, physical and engineering systems, with particularly far-reaching
implications for earthquake physics. A common approach to this problem associates nucleation
with an instability of an expanding creep patch upon surpassing a critical length $L_c$. The critical
nucleation length $L_c$ is conventionally obtained from a spring-block linear stability analysis
extended to interfaces separating elastically-deformable bodies using model-dependent fracture
mechanics estimates. We propose an alternative approach in which the critical nucleation length
is obtained from a related linear stability analysis of homogeneous sliding along interfaces separating
elastically-deformable bodies. For elastically identical half-spaces and rate-and-state friction,
the two approaches are shown to yield $L_c$ that features the same scaling structure, but with substantially
different numerical pre-factors, resulting in a significantly larger $L_c$ in our approach. The
proposed approach is also shown to be naturally applicable to finite-size systems and bimaterial
interfaces, for which various analytic results are derived. To quantitatively test the proposed
approach, we performed inertial Finite-Element-Method calculations for a finite-size two-dimensional
elastically-deformable body in rate-and-state frictional contact with a rigid body under sideway
loading. We show that the theoretically predicted $L_c$ and its finite-size dependence are in reasonably
good quantitative agreement with the full numerical solutions, lending support to the proposed
approach. These results offer a theoretical framework for predicting rapid slip nucleation along
frictional interfaces.
