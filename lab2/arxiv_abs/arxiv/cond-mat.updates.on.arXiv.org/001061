The calculation of dynamical properties for matter under extreme conditions is a challenging task.
The popular Kubo-Greenwood model exploits elements from equilibrium density functional theory
(DFT) that allow a detailed treatment of electron correlations, but its origin is largely phenomenological;
traditional kinetic theories have a more secure foundation but are limited to weak ion-electron
interactions. The objective here is to show how a combination of the two evolves naturally from an
exact short time limit for the generator of the effective single electron dynamics governing time
correlation functions. This provides a theoretical context for the current DFT-related approach,
the Kubo-Greenwood model, while showing the nature of its corrections. The method is to calculate
the exact short time dynamics in the single electron subspace, for a given configuration of the ions.
This differs from the usual kinetic theory approach in which an average over the ions is performed
as well. In this way the effective ion-electron interaction is treated exactly and shown to be determined
from DFT. The correlation functions have the random phase approximation for an inhomogeneous system,
but with renormalized ion-electron and electron-electron potentials. The dynamic structure
function, density response function, and electrical conductivity are calculated as examples.
The static local field corrections in the dielectric function are identified in this way. The current
analysis is limited to semi-classical electrons (quantum statistical potentials), so important
quantum conditions are excluded. However, a quantization of the kinetic theory is identified for
broader application while awaiting its detailed derivation.
