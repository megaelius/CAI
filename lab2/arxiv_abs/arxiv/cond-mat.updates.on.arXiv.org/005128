We study experimentally and numerically the dynamics of the spin ice material Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$
in the low temperature ($T$) and moderate magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}$) regime ($T\in[0.1,1.7]K$,
$B\in[0,0.3]T$). Our objective is to understand the main physics shaping the out-of-equilibrium
magnetisation vs. temperature curves in two different regimes. Very far from equilibrium, turning
on the magnetic field after having cooled the system in zero field (ZFC) can increase the concentration
of magnetic monopoles; this accelerates the dynamics. Similarly to electrolytes, this occurs
through dissociation of bound monopole pairs. However, for spin ices the polarisation of the vacuum
out of which the monopole pairs are created is a key factor shaping the magnetisation curves, with
no analog. We observe a threshold field near $0.2T$ for this fast dynamics to take place, linked to
the maximum magnetic force between the attracting pairs. Surprisingly, within a regime of low temperatures
and moderate fields, an extended Ohm's law can be used to describe the ZFC magnetisation curve obtained
with the dipolar spin-ice model. However, in real samples the acceleration of the dynamics appears
even sharper than in simulations, possibly due to the presence of avalanches. On the other hand,
the effect of the field nearer equilibrium can be just the opposite to that at very low temperatures.
Single crystals, as noted before for powders, abandon equilibrium at a blocking temperature $T_B$
which increases with field. Curiously, this behaviour is present in numerical simulations even
within the nearest-neighbours interactions model. Simulations and experiments show that the
increasing trend in $T_B$ is stronger for $\mathbf{B}\parallel[100]$. This suggests that the
field plays a part in the dynamical arrest through monopole suppression, which is quite manifest
for this field orientation.
