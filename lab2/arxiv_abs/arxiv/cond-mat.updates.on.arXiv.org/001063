The laws of thermodynamics can be extended to the nanoscale, where fluxes are fluctuating quantities.
The second law of thermodynamics implies that in mesoscopic systems entropy increases on average
but leaves open the possibility for these systems to transiently absorb heat from their environment
when driven out of equilibrium. Fluctuation relations relate the probability to produce a certain
amount of entropy and to reduce the same amount of entropy during a fixed time interval and have been
confirmed with different experimental setups. Extreme-value statistics of thermodynamic fluxes
characterize the most extreme deviations from the average behaviors. Here we report on the experimental
measurement of stochastic entropy production and of records of negative entropy. For this purpose,
we employ a metallic double dot under a constant external DC bias which realizes a nonequilibrium
steady state. We find that the cumulative distribution of entropy production's negative record
is bounded at all times by a limiting exponential distribution with a mean value equal to minus the
Boltzmann constant. Using this result, we derive an upper bound for the average maximal entropy
uptake by a mesoscopic system from its environment in a finite time and demonstrate this result with
experimental data. Our work provides general bounds and equalities for the extreme-value statistics
of correlated random variables about which not much is known. Our results will help to shed light
on the statistics of overheating events in single-electronic devices which are relevant for the
design of reversible computing devices operating near minimal heat dissipation governed by Landauer's
principle.
