In this paper, we study topological phases in a 2D photonic crystal with broken time ($\mathcal{T}$)
and parity ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetries by performing calculations of band structures, Berry curvatures,
Chern numbers, edge states and also numerical simulations of light propagation in the edge modes.
Specifically, we consider a hexagonal lattice consisting of triangular gyromagnetic rods. Here
the gyromagnetic material breaks $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry while the triangular rods breaks $\mathcal{P}$
symmetry. Interestingly, we find that the crystal could host quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases
with different gap Chern numbers ($C_g$) including $|C_g| > 1$ as well as quantum valley Hall (QVH)
phases with contrasting valley Chern numbers ($C_v$), depending on the orientation of the triangular
rods. Furthermore, phase transitions among these topological phases, such as from QAH to QVH and
vice versa, can be engineered by a simple rotation of the rods. Our band theoretical analyses reveal
that the Dirac nodes at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in the momentum space are produced and protected by
the mirror symmetry ($m_y$) instead of the $\mathcal{P}$ symmetry, and they become gapped when
either $\mathcal{T}$ or $m_y$ symmetry is broken, resulting in a QAH or QVH phase, respectively.
Moreover, a high Chern number ($C_g = -2$) QAH phase is generated by gapping triply degenerate nodal
points rather than pairs of Dirac points by breaking $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Our proposed photonic
crystal thus provides a platform for investigating intriguing topological phenomena which may
be challenging to realize in electronic systems, and also has promising potentials for device applications
in photonics such as reflection-free one-way waveguides and topological photonic circuits.
