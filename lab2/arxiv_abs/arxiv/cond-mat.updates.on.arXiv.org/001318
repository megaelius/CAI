A recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiment reports the observation of charge density
wave (CDW) with period of approximately 8a in the halo region surrounding the vortex core, in striking
contrast to the approximately period 4a CDW that are commonly observed in the cuprates. Inspired
by this work, we study a model where a bi-directional pair density wave (PDW) with period 8 is at play.
This further divides into two classes, (1) where the PDW is a competing state of the d wave superconductor
and can exist only near the vortex core where the d wave order is suppressed, and (2) where the PDW is
the primary order, the so called mother state that persists with strong phase fluctuations to high
temperature and high magnetic field and lies behind the pseudogap phenomenology. We study the charge
density wave structures near the vortex core in these models. We emphasize the importance of the
phase winding of the d-wave order parameter. The PDW can be pinned by the vortex core due to this winding
and become static. Furthermore, the period 8 CDW inherits the properties of this winding, which
gives rise to a special feature of the Fourier transform peak, namely, it is split in certain directions.
There are also a line of zeros in the inverse Fourier transform of filtered data. We propose that these
are key experimental signatures that can distinguish between the PDW-driven scenario from the
more mundane option that the period 8 CDW is primary. We discuss the pros and cons of the options considered
above. Finally we attempt to place the STM experiment in the broader context of pseudogap physics
of underdoped cuprates and relate this observation to the unusual properties of X ray scattering
data on CDW carried out to very high magnetic field.
