The T91 grade and similar 9Cr tempered-martensitic steels (also known as ferritic-martensitic)
are leading candidate structural alloys for fast fission nuclear and fusion power reactors. At
low temperatures (300 to 400 $^\circ$C) neutron irradiation hardens and embrittles these steels,
therefore it is important to investigate the origin of this mode of life limiting property degradation.
T91 steel specimens were separately neutron irradiated to 2.14 dpa at 327 $^\circ$C and 8.82 dpa
at 377 $^\circ$C in the Idaho National Laboratory Advanced Test Reactor. Atom probe tomography
was used to investigate the segregation driven formation of Mn-Ni-Si-rich (MNSPs) and Cu-rich
(CRP) co-precipitates. The precipitates increase in size and, slightly, in volume fraction at
the higher irradiation temperature and dose, while their corresponding compositions were very
similar, falling near the Si(Mn,Ni) phase field in the Mn-Ni-Si projection of the Fe-based quaternary
phase diagram. While the structure of the precipitates has not been characterized, this composition
range is distinctly different than that of the typically cited G-phase. The precipitates are composed
of CRP with MNSP appendages. Such features are often observed in neutron irradiated reactor pressure
vessel (RPV) steels. However, the Si, Ni, Mn, P and Cu solutes concentrations are lower in the T91
than in typical RPV steels. Thus, in T91 precipitation primarily takes place in solute segregated
regions of line and loop dislocations. These results are consistent with the model for radiation
induced segregation driven precipitation of MNSPs proposed by Ke et al. Cr-rich alpha prime ($\alpha$')
phase formation was not observed.
