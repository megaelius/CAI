The molecular density functional theory of fluids provides an exact theory for computing solvation
free energies in implicit solvents. One of the reasons it has not received nearly as much attention
as quantum density functional theory for implicit electron densities is the paucity of basis set
expansions for this theory. This work constructs a minimal Hilbert space version of the Ornstein-Zernike
theory over the complete spatial, rotational, and internal conformational space that leaves the
choice of basis open. The basis is minimal in the sense that it is isomorphic to a choice of molecular
property space (i.e. moments of the distribution), and does not require auxiliary grids. This can
be exploited, since there are usually only a few `important' properties for determining the structure
and energetics of a molecular fluid. Two novel basis expansions are provided which emphasize either
the multipolar expansion (most useful for flexible molecules) or the rotational distribution
(most useful for rigid bodies described using quaternions). The perspective of this work shows
that radial truncation of the Bessel series over translation space determines an analytical extrapolation
of these functions to the origin in reciprocal space. We provide a new density functional theory
that naturally fits the moment-based, matrix approach. Three diverse applications are presented:
relating the present approach to traditional rotational invariants, demonstrating the stability
of convex optimization on the density functional, and finding analytical expression for dispersion
contributions to the solvation free energies of point polarizable dipoles.
