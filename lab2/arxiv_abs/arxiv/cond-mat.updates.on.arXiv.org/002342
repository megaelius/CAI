Inspired by concepts developed for fermionic systems in the framework of condensed matter physics,
topology and topological states are recently being explored also in bosonic systems. The possibility
of engineering systems with unidirectional wave propagation and protected against disorder is
at the heart of this growing interest. Topogical acoustic effects have been observed in a variety
of systems, most of them based on kHz-MHz sound waves, with typical wavelength of the order of the
centimeter. Recently, some of these concepts have been successfully transferred to acoustic phonons
in nanoscaled multilayered systems. The reported demonstration of confined topological phononic
modes was based on Raman scattering spectroscopy, yet the resolution did not suffice to determine
lifetimes and to identify other acoustic modes in the system. Here, we use time-resolved pump-probe
measurements using an asynchronous optical sampling (ASOPS) technique to overcome these resolution
limitations. By means of one-dimensional GaAs/AlAs distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) as building
blocks, we engineer high frequency ($\sim$ 200 GHz) topological acoustic interface states. We
are able to clearly distinguish confined topological states from stationary band edge modes. The
detection scheme reflects the symmetry of the modes directly through the selection rules, evidencing
the topological nature of the measured confined state. These experiments enable a new tool in the
study of the more complex topology-driven phonon dynamics such as phonon nonlinearities and optomechanical
systems with simultaneous confinement of light and sound.
