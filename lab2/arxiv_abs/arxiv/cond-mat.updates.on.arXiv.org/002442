Electrons living in a two-dimensional world under a strong magnetic field - the so-called fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) - often manifest themselves as fractionally charged quasiparticles
(anyons). Moreover, being under special conditions they are expected to be immune to the environment,
thus may serve as building blocks for future quantum computers. Interference of such anyons is the
very first step towards understanding their anyonic statistics. However, the complex edge-modes
structure of the fractional quantum Hall states, combined with upstream neutral modes, have been
suspected to prevent an observation of the much sought after interference of anyons. Here, we report
of finding a direct correlation between the appearance of neutral modes and the gradual disappearance
of interference in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), as the bulk filling factor is lowered towards
Landau filling {\nu}_B =1; followed by a complete interference quench at {\nu}_B=1. Specifically,
the interference was found to start diminishing at {\nu}_B~1.5 with a growing upstream neutral
mode, which was detected by a born upstream shot noise in the input quantum point contact (QPC) to
the MZI. Moreover, at the same time a {\nu}_QPC =1/3 conductance plateau, carrying shot-noise,
appeared in the transmission of the QPC - persisting until bulk filling {\nu}_B =1/2. We identified
this conductance plateau to result from edge reconstruction, which leads to an upstream neutral
mode. Here, we also show that even the particle-like quasiparticles are accompanied by upstream
neutral modes, therefore suppressing interference in the FQHE regime.
