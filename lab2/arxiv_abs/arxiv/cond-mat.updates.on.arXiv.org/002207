Because of its large Fermi velocity, leading to a great mobility, graphene is expected to play an
important role in (small signal) radio frequency electronics. Among other, graphene devices based
on Klein tunneling phenomena are already envisioned. The connection between the Klein tunneling
times of electrons and cut-off frequencies of graphene devices is not obvious. We argue in this paper
that the trajectory-based Bohmian approach gives a very natural framework to quantify Klein tunneling
times in linear band graphene devices because of its ability to distinguish, not only between transmitted
and reflected electrons, but also between reflected electrons that spend time in the barrier and
those that do not. Without such distinction, typical expressions found in the literature to compute
dwell times can give unphysical results when applied to predict cut-off frequencies. In particular,
we study Klein tunneling times for electrons in a two-terminal graphene device constituted by a
potential barrier between two metallic contacts. We show that for a zero incident angle (and positive
or negative kinetic energy), the transmission coefficient is equal to one, and the dwell time is
roughly equal to the barrier distance divided by the Fermi velocity. For electrons incident with
a non-zero angle smaller than the critical angle, the transmission coefficient decreases and dwell
time can still be easily predicted in the Bohmian framework. The main conclusion of this work is that,
contrary to tunneling devices with parabolic bands, the high graphene mobility is roughly independent
of the presence of Klein tunneling phenomena in the active device region.
