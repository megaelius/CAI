We study an ensemble of diverse (inhomogeneous) thermostatically controlled loads aggregated
to provide the demand response (DR) services in a district-level energy system. Each load in the
ensemble is assumed to be equipped with a random number generator switching heating/cooling on
or off with a Poisson rate, $r$, when the load leaves the comfort zone. Ensemble diversity is modeled
through inhomogeneity/disorder in the deterministic dynamics of loads. Approached from the standpoint
of statistical physics, the ensemble represents a non-equilibrium system driven away from its
natural steady state by the DR. The ability of the ensemble to recover by mixing faster to the steady
state after its DR's use is advantageous. The trade-off between the level of the aggregator's control,
commanding the devices to lower the rate $r$, and the phase-space-oscillatory deterministic dynamics
is analyzed. We discover that there exists a critical value, $r_c$, corresponding to both the most
efficient mixing and the bifurcation point where the ensemble transitions from the oscillatory
relaxation at $r>r_c$ to the pure relaxation at $r<r_c$. Then, we study the effect of the load diversity,
investigating four different disorder probability distributions (DPDs) ranging from the case
of the Gaussian DPD to the case of the uniform with finite support DPD. Demonstrating resemblance
to the similar question of the effectiveness of Landau damping in plasma physics, we show that stronger
regularity of the DPD around its maximum results in faster mixing. Our theoretical analysis is supported
by extensive numerical validation, which also allows us to access the effect of the ensemble's finite
size.
