The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one powerful experimental technique
to study the electronic structure of materials. As many electron materials show unusual many-body
correlations, the technique to detect directly these many-body correlations will play important
roles in the study of their many-body physics. In this article, we propose a technique to detect directly
the two-particle correlations, a coincidence ARPES (cARPES) where two incident photons excite
two respective photoelectrons which are detected in coincidence. While the one-photon-absorption
and one-photoelectron-emission ARPES provides the single-particle spectrum function, the proposed
cARPES with two-photon absorption and two-photoelectron emission is relevant to a two-particle
Bethe-Salpeter wave function. Examples of the coincidence detection probability of the cARPES
for a free Fermi gas and a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting state are studied in
detail. We also propose another two experimental techniques, a coincidence angle-resolved photoemission
and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (cARP/IPES) and a coincidence angle-resolved inverse-photoemission
spectroscopy (cARIPES). As all of these proposed coincidence techniques can provide the two-particle
frequency Bethe-Salpeter wave functions, they can show the momentum and energy dependent two-particle
dynamical physics of the material electrons in the particle-particle or particle-hole channel.
Thus, they can be introduced to study the Cooper-pair physics in the superconductor, the itinerant
magnetism in the metallic ferromagnet/antiferromagnet, and the particle-hole pair physics in
the metallic nematic state. Moreover, as the two-particle Bethe-Salpeter wave functions also
involve the inner-pair dynamical physics, these proposed coincidence techniques can be used to
study the inner-pair time-retarded physics.
