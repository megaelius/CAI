Quantum effects in material systems are often pronounced at low energies and become insignificant
at high temperatures. As we elaborate here, this common occurrence might not, however, hold universally.
We find that, perhaps counterintuitively, certain quantum effects may follow the opposite route
and become progressively sharper so as to emerge in the "classical" high temperature limit. In the
current work, we invoke and extend simple elements of the WKB approximation as applied to general
Hamiltonians, extend the usual kinetic theory by taking into account a possible fundamental quantum
time scale, transition state theory, and the equipartition theorem. On average, the extrapolated
high temperature viscosity of general liquids may tend to a value set by the product of the particle
number density n and Planck's constant h. We compare this theoretical result with experimental
measurements of an ensemble of 23 metallic fluids where this seems to indeed be the case. The extrapolated
high temperature viscosity of each of these liquids divided (for each respective fluid by its value
of nh veers towards a Gaussian with an ensemble average value that is close to unity up to an error of
size 0.6%. In the course of our analysis, we further trivially apply the maximum entropy principle
to suggest a way to infer which rules might govern general measured data sets. We invoke similar ideas
to discuss other transport properties to suggest how simple behaviors may appear including resistivity
saturation and linear T resistivity may appear very naturally. Our approach suggests that minimal
time lags may be present in fluid dynamics (which in the continuum follows the Navier-Stokes equation).
