A crucial factor determining charge transport in organic semiconductors is the electronic coupling
between the molecular constituents, which is heavily influenced by the relative arrangement of
the molecules. This renders quinacridone, with its multiple, structurally fundamentally different
polymorphs and their rich, diverse intermolecular interactions an ideal testcase for analyzing
the correlation between the electronic coupling in a specific configuration and its energetic
stability. To provide an in-depth analysis of this relation, starting from the $\alpha$-polymorph
of quinacridone, we also construct a coplanar model crystal. This allows us to systematically compare
the displacement-dependence of the electronic coupling with that of the total energy. In this way,
we identify the combination of exchange repulsion and electrostatic interactions as driving force
steering the system towards a structure in which the electronic coupling is minimal, especially
for the valence band. Such a situation can be avoided by either increasing the magnitude of the displacement
or by displacements along the short molecular axis, where either the correlation between valence-band
width and total energy is lifted, or where the minima in total energy become so shallow that even minor
structural modifications have the potential to boost the electronic coupling. The general character
of these observations is supported by equivalent trends for an analogous pentacene model system.
Thus, the presented data can be regarded as the basis for analyzing the interplay between electronic
coupling and energetic stability in crystalline organic semiconductors, which makes them a useful
starting point for the future design of materials with improved properties.
